      "title": "Your fridge doesn't have enough power.",
      "content": "Your fridge doesn't have enough power. Make sure the plug is securely connected to the wall to avoid power disruptions. If the plug isn't all the way in, power can be intermittent, which can cause your Samsung fridge not to cool properly. If it is plugged in correctly, unplug it and try plugging something else, like a lamp, into that outlet. You can tell immediately if the outlet isn't giving enough power if the lamp doesn't turn on. To fix this, plug your fridge into another outlet."

      "title": "The door isn't closed all the way.",
      "content": "The door isn't closed all the way. An open or cracked door can allow cold air to leak out, preventing your fridge from cooling down inside. Check the edges for obstructions, like protruding food items, that can prevent the door from closing all the way."

      "title": "The door seals are weak, dirty, or broken.",
      "content": "The door seals are weak, dirty, or broken. Weak seals around the doors let warm air in, preventing your fridge from cooling. Get a piece of paper and shut the door(s) on it. If you can easily pull the paper away, clean the seals with dish soap and water, then try the paper again. If it's still easy to pull away, the seals are damaged, and you can either call for a repair or repair them yourself ."

      "content": "The refrigerator is in a hot room. Direct sunlight or being next to heat sources makes it harder for your fridge to cool down. So, if it's in direct sunlight or next to a heat source, like an oven, relocate it if you can."

      "title": "The thermostat is not set to an ideal temperature.",
      "content": "The thermostat is not set to an ideal temperature. The ideal temperature for most Samsung refrigerator models is 38 °F (3 °C) for the fridge and −2 °F (−19 °C) for the freezer. [1] X Research source You can set or lower the temperature in different ways according to the fridge model you have. For Family Hub models, you can control and monitor the temperature in the SmartThings or Fridge Manager app. [2] X Research source Your refrigerator can take up to 28 hours to cool down to your set temperature."

      "title": "There is not enough room to vent heat.",
      "content": "There is not enough room to vent heat. Your Samsung fridge expels heat to keep cool. Make sure there's at least 2 inches of clearance at the top, back, and sides of your fridge. Without that clearance, the heat will not have anywhere to go, keeping your fridge warmer than it should be."

      "title": "The condenser coils are frozen or dirty.",
      "content": "The condenser coils are frozen or dirty. You can find these coils at the back of your fridge; unplug your fridge from power, pull it out from the wall so you can see the coils, and take the coil cover off. If they are dirty or covered in frost, your fridge won't cool. If the coils are covered in frost, leave the fridge powered off to let the ice defrost. Once defrosted, wipe the coils with a clean cloth, replace the cover, push the unit back into place, and plug it in again. If the coils are dirty, clean them with a soft-bristled brush and a vacuum, then replace the cover, push the unit back into place, and plug it in."

      "title": "The condenser fan is faulty.",
      "content": "The condenser fan is faulty. Give your fridge about 28 hours to cool down and normalize the interior temperature. If it still isn't cooling, you want to check the condenser fan: First, unplug the fridge from power and pull it away from the wall. Find the fan, remove the cover, and then manually turn the fan 360 degrees. If anything is preventing the fan from rotating, remove it. If the fan is frosted over, let it defrost. You might need to replace the fan if it still doesn't rotate 360 degrees."

      "title": "The fridge is too empty or too full.",
      "content": "The fridge is too empty or too full. Empty fridges are harder to keep cool, but you'll also have a hard time cooling a fridge that's too densely packed with food. Maintain ⅔ of your fridge so it has to cool down less whenever you open the doors. Here are some tips for maintaining the food in your fridge: Use sealable and stackable containers. These keep excess moisture down. Put fruits and vegetables in the crisper drawer(s). Using the drawers is similar to using sealable containers and will help keep excess moisture to a minimum. Use the Flex Zone (if you have it) for odds and ends, like snacks and beverages. [3] X Research source Avoid putting perishable food in the doors, since this area gets a blast of warm air every time you open the fridge. If you have a lot of open space, fill water bottles to stay within the ⅔ mark."

If you have a Family Hub model, tap Apps , open Fridge Manager , and tap Fridge Settings . If \"Cooling Off\" is set to \"On,\" tap the switch to turn it off, and then tap Proceed .

      "content": "If your Samsung fridge notices something is wrong, it'll display an error code. This can let you know things like the evaporator fan isn't working or the auto-defrost option isn't functioning. In that case, you can further troubleshoot to solve those specific error codes to fix your fridge and get it to cool. You can run a self-check cycle on Samsung fridges with Family Hub. Simply navigate to Apps on the touch-screen on your fridge and go to Fridge Manager > Fridge Settings > Self Check > Start . [6] X Research source These error codes will also check different components, like the start relay and thermistor. Common Samsung fridge error codes that can affect cooling: 22E, 22C: Fridge fan error, which often means the door has been left open for too long. If you get this error, unplug the fridge, plug it back in, and close the doors to reset it. 21E: Freezer fan error, which indicates a frozen freezer fan. This error is often caused by a door that wasn't closed all the way or a fan motor failure. Defrost the freezer, and make sure the unit isn't packed too full. OF OF or O FF: This error indicates your refrigerator is in Demo Mode. Check your manual for specific instructions on disabling Demo Mode on your fridge."

      "title": "Use the SmartThings app or press the buttons to lower the temperature.",
      "content": "Use the SmartThings app or press the buttons to lower the temperature. You can lower the temperature of your fridge in a few different ways, depending on the model of your Samsung fridge: For Samsung fridges with Family Hub, use the SmartThings app. If you have an older model, use the Fridge Manager app instead. For models with Fridge and Freezer buttons, press the Fridge or Freezer button repeatedly to lower the temp. If the fridge has Power Cool , you can repeatedly press the Fridge button to activate it and prompt your fridge to cool down quickly. If your fridge has arrow buttons, press either of them to find the Fridge , Freezer , or Flex Zone menu. Then, press the circular button in the middle of the arrows to select that menu. Use the arrows to find the temperature you want and press O again to set it. For Samsung fridges with the \"Freezer convert\" button, make sure you have the right settings. You can accidentally change the settings so the freezer is converted into a fridge without knowing it. In that case, you can think that your freezer isn't cooling down enough. Touch and hold the Freezer Convert button or the Fridge On/Off button for 3 seconds to rotate through the options. You may need to do this a few times to change your settings completely.
