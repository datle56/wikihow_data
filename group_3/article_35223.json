      "content": "Read a reflexology chart like a map. According to Karina Klimtchuk, a Licensed Acupuncturist & Diplomate of Oriental Medicine, applying pressure to different parts of the foot will stimulate a response in another part of the body. For instance, you can actually relieve neck tension by pressing certain points on the foot. Reflexology can affect the digestive system, the heart, and the nervous system. The brain takes the input from the pressure point and interprets it, then sends signals to the corresponding parts of the body to help you relax or have better digestion, or sleep more soundly. When you look at one of these charts, find whatever part of the body that you want to activate and work on and apply the treatment there like a map.
