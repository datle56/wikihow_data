      "content": "Portals are gateways to the spirit world that are opened through mirrors. This superstition has been used in many ancient cultures and is still believed by many supernatural practitioners today. The idea is that when two mirrors face each other, they open a portal to the spirit world or another dimension, allowing spirits or other supernatural entities to enter our world. [1] X Research source While many people believe mirrors act as portals, there is no scientific evidence to support this. However, some scientists do believe in the possibility of a “mirror” or parallel universe. People likely believe mirrors are portals because mirrors are considered liminal spaces, or areas that are thought to make travel between the spirit world and physical realm easier. Other liminal spaces include windows and glass doors. Two mirrors facing each other are believed to create infinite images, which is what opens the portal between the spiritual and physical worlds. Scientifically, this is an optical illusion, as the mirrors absorb light with each reflection, limiting the number of visible images."

[4] X Research source As mentioned above, the “infinite” loop is an optical illusion, as the light picked up in each reflection limits how many images are visible."
