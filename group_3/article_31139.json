      "content": "Labels in Gmail are organized by letter and number. This means you can’t drag and drop them to reorder them, but you can change their order by renaming them. To do this, open Gmail in a browser on your computer, then hover your cursor over the name of the label you want to edit. Click the down arrow ▼ or menu button … that appears next to the label and select Edit from the menu that pops up, then change the name of the label and click Save . [1] X Research source For instance, if you want to have multiple “Work” labels, you can organize them by labeling them “Work1,” “Work2,” “Work3,” and so on. Or, put letters at the beginnings of folders with different names to change their display order—e.g., “A-Work,” “B-Receipts,” and so on."
