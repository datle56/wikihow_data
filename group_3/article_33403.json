The board has two 2X2 lake areas on it that pieces cannot move through and that act as the barrier space when you first set up the game. Do not place any pieces on or near these spots when you set up the game. Keep the two center rows of the board empty until the game has started. [2] X Research source"

Each army has 33 army pieces and every piece is ranked from 1-10 (1 is the lowest rank and 10 is the highest rank). Each set also includes 6 Bombs and 1 Flag, but these pieces are not ranked and they do not move. Only the army pieces may move and attack. Each army set includes: [3] X Research source 10 : 1 Marshall 9 : 1 General 8 : 2 Colonels 7 : 3 Majors 6 : 4 Captains 5 : 4 Lieutenants 4 : 4 Sergeants 3 : 5 Miners 2 : 8 Scouts 1 : 1 Spy"

Try choosing at random by holding two different color pieces in each hand (so your opponent cannot see them) and ask your opponent to choose one. Whatever color your opponent chooses will be his or her color for the game. [4] X Research source"

Before you set you your army pieces, you will need to set up the fortress screen to prevent your opponent from seeing how you are positioning your pieces.

      "content": "Move your pieces. Take turns moving your pieces in vertical or horizontal directions. Pieces may not move in a diagonal direction. Pieces may only move one space, except for the Scouts which can move an unlimited distance. Just keep in mind that because only scouts can move more than one space per turn, moving a scout more than one space will reveal its identity to your opponent and may cause your opponent to attack that piece. [8] X Research source Pieces cannot jump over the lake or over other pieces. They also may not occupy the same space as another piece. [9] X Research source Pieces cannot move back and forth between the same two spaces over three consecutive turns."

You may only attack pieces that are directly next to your pieces. They may not be a space away or diagonal to one of your pieces. They must be right next to each other in a vertical or horizontal direction. [10] X Research source When you attack your opponent (or your opponent attacks you) you must both announce the rank of your piece that attacked (or was attacked). Whatever piece has the highest ranking wins the fight. Remove the losing piece from the board. If both pieces have the same rank, then remove both pieces from the board. Place captured pieces in the tray as you play. Doing so will help to keep them organized for future games. Place the winning piece on the space that was occupied by the losing piece.

If the Spy is attacked by the Marshal, then the Spy is captured instead. Scouts can move and attack on the same turn. No other pieces can do both in the same turn Miners can disarm Bomb pieces.

However, this strategy may fail if your opponent uses a miner to defuse these Bombs and then captures your Flag. If you do surround your Flag with Bombs, make sure that you have some high ranking, moveable pieces nearby to take out any approaching pieces. [14] X Research source"
