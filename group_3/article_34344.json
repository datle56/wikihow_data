      "content": "Contact a local FFL dealer to facilitate your sale. This sounds similar to what you have to do if you want to sell your gun to someone who lives in another state, but it's not quite the same. The FFL dealer merely conducts the background check—they don't actually have anything to do with the sale. Just search your local area online or use a map app to find the best dealer for both you and the buyer. [1] X Research source Since Virginia passed a universal background check law in 2020, background checks are now required for all gun sales, including person-to-person or private sales. [2] X Research source For the sake of convenience, it's usually also best to go ahead and complete the sale immediately after the background check is approved—so look for an FFL dealer that works for both you and the buyer."

      "title": "Draft your own bill of sale for the firearm.",
      "content": "Draft your own bill of sale for the firearm. A bill of sale creates an official record of the transaction and the transfer of ownership. While it's not legally required, it's still a good idea to write one up and keep it for your records just in case. There are lots of free forms online that you can download and use so you're not starting from scratch. [3] X Research source Send a copy of the bill of sale to your buyer before you go to the dealer to finalize the transaction. That way, you can be sure that you agree on the price and a method of payment in advance."

      "content": "Meet the buyer at the dealer's location with your firearm. [4] X Research source Bring a government-issued photo ID with you that includes your current address, and make sure the buyer does the same. The dealer will need to verify that you're both Virginia residents and include the information on the required background check forms. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Fill out the seller's portions of the Firearms Transaction Record. The Firearms Transaction Record is the ATF form that the FFL dealer requires you both to fill out. The first part requires information about the firearm you're selling. The final section requires you to provide identification information.

But since this is a private sale that the dealer has nothing to do with, you'll fill out that section yourself."

      "title": "Wait for the background check to come through.",
      "content": "Wait for the background check to come through. The dealer may use VCheck, Virginia's online system, or may call the 1-800 number. Either way, they'll typically find out within a few minutes if the transaction is approved. If additional information is required to approve the transaction, the dealer will discuss this with the buyer. [7] X Research source The dealer typically charges a fee to run the background check. The fee varies depending on the dealer but is usually less than $20. Make sure you and the buyer are on the same page about which one of you is paying the fee."

Get your copy of the bill of sale along with your money, then hand them the firearm. While the law doesn't require you to complete the transaction there at the dealer, it just makes sense to go ahead and do it there. [8] X Research source The dealer might instruct you to go to a private room, or even out in the parking lot, to complete the transaction once the background check is complete."

      "content": "Register as a vendor if you plan to sell multiple firearms. When you register as a vendor, you pay a fee to the gun show promoter to have a table at the event. You can use that table to display the firearms and other goods you have for sale as well as to complete transactions. [9] X Research source This isn't the same thing as becoming an FFL dealer—it just means you have a table at the event and can display the firearms and other goods you have for sale. You're still considered a private party for the purposes of a firearm transaction."

Leave the information about the buyer and the firearm blank—you can fill that in for each transaction.

At a gun show, it's the buyer's responsibility to get clearance from the State Police before they finalize a transaction with you. They'll have a form from the State Police certifying that they're clear to buy a gun from you.

      "content": "Get a gift card to an FFL dealer instead of a new firearm. This is always the safest way to go, and what the ATF recommends. With a gift card, the person can choose the gun that best suits them. And you can't be held liable at all if something goes sideways (or if it turns out the person can't legally possess a firearm). [14] X Research source This makes things much easier if you're thinking about buying a gun as a gift for someone who lives in another state. Just buy a gift card for a dealer that is local to them."

[15] X Research source But you can never transfer a firearm to someone you know isn't legally entitled to possess one—that's federal law. [16] X Research source Generally, the person you want to give a firearm to has to be over the age of 18 with a clean criminal record. If you have questions about whether they're legally allowed to possess a firearm, it's a good idea to give them a gift card to an FFL dealer instead."

As long as you're certain the person can legally own a firearm, you're free to give one to them directly. [17] X Research source There's no background check required as long as you're giving the firearm away as a gift free and clear, not exchanging it for anything of value. [18] X Research source For example, if you're trading a gun to a family member in exchange for them doing some work around your house, that wouldn't qualify as a gift and your family member would need to get a background check. The Virginia State Police recommends calling the Firearms Transaction Center at (804) 674-2292 before you make the actual transfer. [19] X Research source This way, you can make sure your transfer follows all applicable federal and state laws."
