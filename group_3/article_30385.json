      "title": "Change the bedding after the birth.",
      "content": "Change the bedding after the birth. After the dog has given birth to the litter, she will shed part of the uterine lining, which is called lochia. Right after the birth, you should immediately change the bedding. During the birth, she will have shed not just lochia, but also other fetal tissue. As soon as the birthing is done, switch the blankets, newspaper, and other materials in the whelping box. To change the bedding, you can try to get the help of another person. You or the other person can hold the dog while the other changes the bedding. If you don't have help, move the mother and puppies to one side of the whelping box, then lift up the empty side and immediately place the new bedding. Once that is down, move the mother and puppies to the clean side and do the same for the other side. Doing this helps reduce the risk of the mother dog and the puppies getting an infection."
