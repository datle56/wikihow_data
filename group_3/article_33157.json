This is an application you’ll need to play old-school games in Terminal. In order to get Emacs, first you need to install Homebrew, a package manager that allows you to make special modifications to your Mac. [1] X Research source To install it: First, install Apple’s Command Line toolkit if you haven’t already done so. In Terminal, enter the command xcode-select --install and press Return . If a window pops up asking if you want to install the Command Line, click Install . Follow the prompts to finish the installation process. You’ll see an error message if you’ve already installed the Command Line toolkit in the past. If you’re using macOS Catalina or later, switch to the bash shell before you continue. To do this, enter chsh -s /bin/bash , type in your Mac’s administrator password, and then restart Terminal. Enter the following command and then press Return : /bin/bash -c \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh )\" When prompted, enter your administrator password and press Return , then press Return again.
