      "content": "An old Singer sewing machine may be worth a few thousand dollars. Sewing machine value fluctuates depending on factors like functionality, special features, age, rarity, demand, and more. Generally speaking, though, if your sewing machine is in high demand and good condition, it'll be worth more than one that's in low demand and poor condition. In order to figure out how much your sewing machine is worth, you'll need to evaluate its market value. We'll explain how to do that in the next section!"

      "title": "Age",
      "content": "Age Depending on the age of your Singer sewing machine, it may be worth a pretty penny. Vintage models (models less than 100 years old) and antique models (models older than 100 years old) generally fluctuate in value, with fully-functional vintage models often offering a higher price tag than damaged or non-working antique models. Determine the age by checking the manufacturing date or serial number on the machine. [1] X Research source Some models may be worth more depending on the specific period of history they originated in. For example, the Singer 27 has a high value due to its use in World War 1. The International Sewing Machine Collectors Society (ISMCS) values some vintage machines higher than others, increasing the demand for certain machines."

      "content": "Model Different models of Singer sewing machines have different values. For example, the Singer 27 isn’t worth as much as the Featherweight models, as the Featherweights are a lot less common. Determine your machine type by checking the model number on the front or side of the machine and running it through the Singer Sewing Machine Serial Number Database . [2] X Research source Different Singer machines have different variations, and some of those variations can have a higher value than the original machine. For example, the Singer 15 has different variations, some of which are worth more than others, like the Mint Green Singer 15-125, which is worth more than the Singer 15-91. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Condition Old Singer sewing machines that are in working condition and have minimal to no damage will typically be worth the most. If you don’t have any scratches or rusting on your machine, and as long as any missing parts are easily replaceable, you’re in good hands. But, old Singer sewing machines that are damaged, non-working, or in generally poor condition won’t be worth as much as those that are well-kept. [4] X Research source Vintage machines that are in good condition are typically worth more than antique machines that are in poor condition. If your machine also includes original accessories (like foot pedals, treadles, carrying cases, or bobbins), it may be worth a bit more as well. [5] X Research source"

For example, common machines like the Singer 15 aren’t going to be worth as much as rare machines, like the Singer 1 or the Singer 12. Older machines in working condition may be rarer than newer machines that don’t work, so keep that in mind as you determine your Singer’s value. [8] X Research source Additionally, some Singer sewing machines have special features that increase their value. For example, the Singer 15 has a reverse and drop feed that isn’t present on models like the 27. [9] X Research source"

      "content": "Enter the serial number into the Singer database to determine its age. Look for the serial number on your sewing machine. If it has a hand crank with a treadle, check the throat plate or bed for a sequence of 8 numbers. If it’s electric with a treadle, check the right side for a sequence of 2 letters followed by 6 numbers. For a standard electric machine, check underneath. For a machine from the '60s or later, check the front or side. [10] X Research source Once you have the number, enter it into the Singer Sewing Machine Serial Number Database to determine the age."

It was also the first of Singer’s sewing machines to use vibrating shuttle technology, which moves the shuttle in a circular arc. [12] X Research source Value: $20-$1,100. Typically around $190. Factors That Influence Value: Older models with accessories and working parts are typically worth more. Newer, machines with damaged or non-working parts are worth less.

Some 201 models have lights fitted to the front of the machine, while others have them fitted onto the back. The stitch adjuster is the main way to differentiate this model from the 66, as the 201 tends to feature a molded circle around the stitch adjuster. [17] X Research source Value: $85-$895.
