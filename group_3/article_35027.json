      "content": "Get a Gible with the Adamant or Jolly nature. You can either keep on catching Gible until you get one or you can breed until you get one. Giving the Gible parent an Everstone to hold will probably increase the chances of getting a good nature. These natures are the ones that you'll want because they don't lower any of Garchomp's perfect stats. You can find Gible in the Wayward Cave (near the secret entrance). This is the only room where Gible shows up, but it has a 15% chance of spawning so getting one shouldn’t be too hard. [1] X Research source Jolly might be the best, because then Salamence, Pikachu, and Celebi will not be faster than your Garchomp, and you can outrun faster Pokémon such as Gengar."

      "content": "Train your Gible so it gets 252 Attack EVs and 252 Speed EVs. You can use Protein and Carbos for the first 100 EVs in each stat if you have enough money."

      "title": "Your Gible can learn powerful moves via TMs or by leveling up.",
      "content": "Your Gible can learn powerful moves via TMs or by leveling up. If you do not mind extra training, then breed for a Gible egg. Its stats (could) be higher and it can learn powerful egg moves like Thrash. Placing it in the day-care will require a lot of walking, but allows higher EV training."

      "content": "Continue to teach it powerful moves. You can do this as your Pokémon levels up, or by teaching it TMs."

    {
      "title": "Decide whether you want a powerful attack or a powerful ability.",
      "content": "Decide whether you want a powerful attack or a powerful ability. At level 49, the Gabite can learn Dragon Rush, a highly powerful but slightly inaccurate move. Evolving it at level 48 will give a marginal amount of extra Attack. Evolving it at level 49 lets you learn Dragon Rush earlier. It's your choice."

      "title": "Certain moves are especially powerful on Garchomp.",
      "content": "Certain moves are especially powerful on Garchomp. Consider teaching it moves like Earthquake, Stone Edge, Rockslide, Dragon Claw, Dragon Rush, Dual Chop, Outrage, Dragonbreath, Dragon Pulse, or Draco Meteor. Some other potentially good moves are: Fire Fang Crunch Dragon Dance Substitute Protect"

      "content": "You may win many more matches than you previously did. If you use Garchomp on the same team as a Tyranitar, Garchomp will get a 20% chance to avoid getting hit. Just remember to have other Pokémon that can take in Water, Grass, Ice, Fighting, and Fairy attacks. Another good idea if you want to do this is to give it a Yache Berry to hold. This will let your Garchomp survive most Ice type attacks."
