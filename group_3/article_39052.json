      "title": "Clean your bathroom.",
      "content": "Clean your bathroom. It will be difficult to create a romantic atmosphere in a dirty bathroom. To set up the most romantic evening possible, you'll need to make sure nothing in the bathroom is dirty or grimy. This includes not only the bathtub, but the rest of your bathroom as well. Mop or sweep the floor, wash out the bathtub, and clean all surfaces, including the sink. [1] X Research source It’s not necessary to spend hours cleaning, but making the bathroom look presentable is important."

      "title": "Choose a good time.",
      "content": "Choose a good time. The best time is when you know you will be uninterrupted. Unanticipated guests or interruptions can quickly ruin a romantic mood. Make sure roommates or children will be away so that you and your partner are able to relax without fear of being interrupted. If you live with other people, ask when they will be out to get a good idea for a date and time to plan the bath.

      "title": "Set up a solid plan.",
      "content": "Set up a solid plan. Make sure your partner will be available when you set up the bath. Nothing will dampen the mood like being informed that your partner is suddenly busy, or will be coming home much later than expected. Set up a time with your partner, and ask that they stick with it. You can secure up a time by sending out a cute, handwritten invitation that says something like: “You are invited to join me this evening for a romantic bubble bath.” [3] X Research source If you want to keep it a surprise, you can tell your partner that you need them home to help you with something at a certain time."

      "title": "Select a couple of items to add to your bath.",
      "content": "Select a couple of items to add to your bath. Too many additions might make the water overly fragrant or look too crowded. Limit the amount of things you put in your bath to three or four components. These items can be roses, essential oils, bath salts, and bubble bath. Make a list of what you want to put in the bath, and make sure you have everything before preparing the bath. [4] X Research source You can buy all of the ingredients at most supermarkets. For nicer essential oils and bubble baths, look for a store like Bath and Body Works."

    {
      "title": "Draw a bath.",
      "content": "Draw a bath. Don’t run a bath too long before your partner gets home, or it will run cold. You should run the bath about ten minutes before you are expecting to get into the bath. It’s better to make the water a little hotter than comfortable because it will cool down before you step into it. Let the bathtub fill up to a comfortable level that will be full enough, but not overfilled."

      "title": "Pour bubble bath into the running water.",
      "content": "Pour bubble bath into the running water. Adding bubble bath to the water while the tub is filling up adds a mood of both frivolity and romance. Look for more scents such as vanilla, rather than using the same fruity-scented bubbles you would put in a child's bath. Don’t overdo the bubbles to the point that they flow out of the bath, but add in enough that the bathtub is filled with them. The bubbles will fade quicker than expected. [5] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Add bath salts.",
      "content": "Add bath salts. Bath salts help soften skin and usually add pleasant scents and colors to your bath. These are available at most bed and bath shops, as well as some specialty or beauty supply stores. Epsom salts and sea salts are examples of salts that you can add to your bath. Epsom and sea salt also help to detoxify skin."

      "title": "Add a few drops of essential oils.",
      "content": "Add a few drops of essential oils. Adding a couple drops of essential oils, such as lavender, jasmine, or cedar wood, to the bathwater introduces aromatherapy into your romantic soak. The oils smell great, but they can also affect your mood. They can make you feel relaxed or invigorated. Make sure not to add in too many drops, especially if your bubble bath is scented. Lavender oil is great for relaxation. Lemon oil is good for invigoration. Reader Poll: We asked 116 wikiHow readers if they think baths help them relax, and 84% said yes . [Take Poll]"

      "content": "Put rose petals on top of the water. Rose petals sprinkled on top of the water add a romantic and fragrant effect to your bath. You can also blend a few cups of rose petals with blender filled with warm water to make a puree. Swirl it into the hot bathwater, or massage it on each other during the bath. [6] X Research source You can also spread some rose petals throughout your bathroom for an added romantic effect."

      "content": "Set out a loofah or sponge. Gather or purchase large sponges or loofahs to use while you are soaking in the tub. The more absorbent the sponges are, the better, because it allows you to squeeze the warm water over body parts that are not submerged. Use the loofah to rub on your partner during the bath. [7] X Research source Make sure the loofah or sponge is clean before using."

      "title": "Light candles.",
      "content": "Light candles. Set the scene by lighting candles around the bathroom. You can also set candles around the edge of the tub if the rim is wide enough that you won't knock them over. Tea light candles are great because they usually come with plenty in a package to set up. Any type of candle will work though. [8] X Research source Turn off the lights so your bathroom is illuminated only by candlelight."

      "content": "Create a playlist. Make a playlist beforehand to ensure you have a constant stream of your favorite romantic music playing during your bath. Try to find music choices that you both enjoy. Set up speakers or a music playing device ahead of time, and keep all electronic devices far away from the water to avoid electrocution. You can use an smartphone hooked up to a speaker, or a CD player. [9] X Research source"

      "content": "Prepare a tray with treats. Prepare a tray with glasses of champagne or wine and strawberries or grapes to enjoy with your partner while soaking in the bath. Set the tray on a small table near the tub so it is easy for you both to access. There are also trays made to fit over each side of the bathtub, so that you can have the tray in the bathtub with you.

      "content": "Have towels ready. Have fluffy towels or bathrobes ready for when you are ready to get out of the bath. As an extra loving touch, warm the towels or robes ahead of time in the dryer or using a towel warmer. If you don’t have a dryer or towel warmer, you can set your oven to 150 °F (65.6 °C), place the towels in a clean roasting pan, and cover the pan with foil. Keep the towels in the oven only long enough for them to get warm.
