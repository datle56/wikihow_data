      "content": "Inspect the paint to make sure the clear coat is still intact. Unfortunately, you won’t be able to restore spots where the clear coat is gone, no matter how much you polish. Check the car and see if there are any spots where the paint is peeling or flaking off. If most of the paint looks okay and is only faded, then the polishing process should restore it. [1] X Research source You can still restore the rest of the car if there are damaged spots. Those damaged spots will just still look faded when you're done. If the clear coat is gone, don’t panic! You can still sand and re-paint these spots, or the whole car if you have to. [2] X Expert Source Angel Ricardo Auto Technician Expert Interview. 1 October 2019."

      "content": "Park in a well-ventilated and shady area. You’ll be working with chemicals and don’t want to inhale any fumes or make a mess. Make sure you’re working outside, or in a garage with the door open. Also work in a shaded area, so the car compound works properly. [3] X Research source Try to make sure the car's surface is at least 50 °F (10 °C) so the polish and wax don't solidify."

      "title": "Wash your car",
      "content": "Wash your car with soap and water to get rid of any dirt. Wet the car with a hose, then pour some car soap into a bucket of water. Swish a microfiber cloth or sponge around to make the water sudsy. Scrub the whole car, working from top to bottom, to get a nice layer of soap on it. [4] X Research source A power washer makes this job a lot easier, but a plain garden hose or bucket of water will do the trick too. Don’t try to wax or polish the car without washing it first. If there’s any dirt on the car, the brushes will scratch the paint."

      "content": "Rinse and dry the car. Spray the car down once more with the hose to get rid of any suds and soap scum. When you’re done, rub the car down with a clean, dry microfiber cloth. Then leave the car outside to dry before moving on. [5] X Research source Don’t start compounding or polishing until the car is totally dry. The compound won’t work right if the car is wet."

      "content": "Rub the car with a clay bar to remove tough residue. Squeeze the bar in your hand to soften it up a bit and shape it into a disc. Then spray the clay lubricant onto the spot you're working on and rub it with the clay in a back-and-forth motion. When you're done, wipe the lubricant off with a clean microfiber towel. Continue working around the car and rub any faded spots. [6] X Research source Clay bars are sold at any auto parts store. If your car only has minor sun damage, the clay bar treatment might actually fix it right up without further polishing. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Rub compound on the car in a circular motion with a wet buffing pad. Squeeze some compound onto a wet microfiber pad. Rub it onto the car in a circular motion and spread it around so the car paint looks a bit hazy. Use increasing pressure to work the compound into the paint. Apply it to all the faded sections of the car. [9] X Research source Car compound is a common item that you can find in any auto store. It works like sandpaper and removes damaged paint layers. You can do all of this by hand, or with a rotary buffer. If you use a buffer, make sure to press lightly so you don’t take off any of the car’s paint. [10] X Research source"

You’ll probably already notice more shine on the car! [11] X Research source You might need to switch to a fresh towel if the one you’re using gets too gunked up."

      "content": "Squeeze polish onto a pad and rub it onto the damaged areas. The polish goes on in the exact same way as the compound. Squeeze some polish onto a new microfiber pad and rub it into the damaged parts of the car with a circular motion until the paint looks hazy. [12] X Research source Car polish is also very easy to find at any auto store. It’s similar to the compound, but is less abrasive for a finer finish. Use a fresh pad to apply the polish! Don’t use the same one you used for the compound."

Work around the whole car to get all the polish off. Now your car is probably really shining! [13] X Research source If some spots still look faded, then the clear coat was probably too sun-damaged. You can fix that by re-painting those spots."

Let the wax dry for 2 minutes, then wipe it off with a clean microfiber cloth. [14] X Research source If you’re waxing near trim or plastic parts of your car, cover them with masking tape first. The wax could discolor these sections. [15] X Research source"

      "content": "Park in the shade as much as possible to limit sun exposure. Sun damage can’t happen without the sun, after all. Whenever you take your car out, try to find a shady spot to leave it in. Awnings, trees, or buildings all provide good cover. If you have a garage at home, park in there. These little tricks should protect the paint from harmful UV rays. [16] X Research source If you don’t have a shady spot to park, you could also protect the car with a sheet or car covering."

Give your car a good wash every 2-4 weeks to maintain that shine. Also wax the car every time you wash it to protect the finish. [17] X Research source Washing and waxing the car yourself might be too time-consuming, so you can always bring it to a carwash for more convenience."
