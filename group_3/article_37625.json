      "content": "Use this shuffle for serious games, or for practice. Performing the riffle shuffle on a table surface makes it more difficult for players to catch a glimpse of the cards while shuffling, which is why this method is often used in casinos. [1] X Research source It's also easier than riffle shuffling in your hands, so start here if you are learning how to riffle shuffle."

      "content": "Separate the deck into two stacks. Neatly stack the deck of cards on the table in front of you. Use your right thumb and forefinger to pick up approximately half the deck. [2] X Research source Move it to the right, then pick up the left stack with your left hand in the same way."
    },
    {
      "title": "Hold the stacks.",
      "content": "Hold the stacks. Arrange the two stacks so the long edge of the cards is facing you. On the right stack, place your right thumb along that edge, near the right-hand corner. Place your index finger lightly on top of the stack. [3] X Research source Place your middle finger against the opposite long edge, with your other fingers resting next to it or on the table. Repeat these motions to grip the left stack."

      "title": "Position the stacks.",

      "title": "Riffle shuffle.",
      "content": "Riffle shuffle. Bend the closest, long edge of each stack upward with your thumbs, while leaving the far, long edge against the table. Simultaneously move your thumbs upward along the edge, releasing cards to snap back onto the table. The cards from each stack should overlap each other as they fall. The cards will probably not alternate perfectly from one stack, then the next. A perfectly interlaced riffle shuffle is called an out shuffle or in shuffle. [4] X Research source This is incredibly difficult to accomplish, and is typically only used by skilled card trick magicians."

    {
      "title": "Try an alternate method.",
      "content": "Try an alternate method. If you are having trouble getting the cards to overlap, try this method instead. Grip the outer, short edge of each stack with their pinky and ring fingers, and the inner, short edge with their thumb. Bend the inner side of the stacks upward with your thumb, using your index fingers to press the outer side down flat on the table. [5] X Research source Release the cards gradually by moving your thumb upward and outward, so the cards snap back down onto the table in an overlapping pattern. This bends the cards more severely , wearing them down faster and potentially making them easier to view during the shuffle."

      "content": "Use this shuffle to impress. Riffle shuffling in your hands is a bit more difficult than using the table, and it's more likely that the people you play cards with won't know how to do it themselves. Once learned, you can quickly end with a flashy bridge finish for additional effect. [6] X Research source This method is not used in casinos, since other players can often see the cards during the shuffle. Like any riffle shuffle, this does bend the cards, and can wear them out faster than other shuffles."

Here are a couple common options: Use your pinky finger to curl around the cards next to your middle and ring fingers. Place the knuckle of your index finger on top of the pile. or Place your pinky finger and index finger on the long edges of the stack, keeping it stable from side to side. [7] X Research source"

[8] X Research source You may use your index finger to help bend the cards, pushing downward near the middle or the finger-gripped edge of the card.

The riffle shuffle leaves you with two stacks of cards, interwoven along one short edge. If you've riffle shuffled one corner together, rotate the stacks slightly so they are aligned in one, straight line. The bridge finish is also called a \"waterfall\" or \"cascade\" finish.
