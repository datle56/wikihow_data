Regular wine bottles and some bottles of hard alcohol come corked with straight corks that can be recycled in Champagne bottles to help preserve the leftovers. [1] X Research source To recycle an old cork, insert the old wine or whiskey cork into the Champagne bottle in place of the original cork.

      "content": "Use a special sealer or stopper. There are sealers and stoppers available that are made for preserving Champagne, and they are specially designed to fit into Champagne bottles. Some of these are vacuum sealers that remove excess air from the bottle, while others are specially designed stoppers that are able to withstand the pressure that will build up in the bottle. Only wine made using a special tradition in the Champagne region of France can be called Champagne. Sparkling wine from different regions may have bottles with different sized openings, so make sure you're using a Champagne-specific stopper."
