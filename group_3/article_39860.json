      "title": "Pack pillows, blankets, and a sleeping bag.",
      "content": "Pack pillows, blankets, and a sleeping bag. This will help your car feel comfier and more like your own bed. Neck pillows are also great to have for a little more support on the road. [1] X Research source Make sure you bring enough bedding to accommodate your passengers, especially if they are children. If you are taking a road trip with another person and plan on taking turns driving, you could bring one set of pillows and blankets to save on room space inside the car. Be sure to pack these items inside the car and not in the trunk or on the roof. You may get sleepy earlier than you anticipated, and it's helpful not to have to leave the car when conditions outside aren't great. A weighted blanket can be extra comfy in the car, as long as it doesn't make you too hot.

If you don’t have room for a pillow, clothes stuffed into a sleeping bag can work in a pinch."

      "title": "Bring a blow up mattress or sleeping pad for long trips.",
      "content": "Bring a blow up mattress or sleeping pad for long trips. If you plan on sleeping in your car multiple times, you may want to make it a little bit comfier. Invest in a sleeping pad or an air mattress that can fit in the back of your car comfortably. [3] X Research source Sleeping pads and mattresses are optional, but they’ll make a long road trip feel a little more like home. If you can lay the seats down in the back of your car, you can probably fit a small sleeping pad in it. If you have a truck, you can put a mattress in the truck bed instead of the cab."

      "title": "Pack comforting items to help you fall asleep.",
      "content": "Pack comforting items to help you fall asleep. A lot of people have difficulty sleeping in locations other than their beds. Bring soothing items you use regularly to relax in order to make you feel more comfortable in your car. [4] X Research source For example, if you enjoy reading before bed, bring a book and book light so you can read before falling asleep. Music is helpful here, but don't rely on your car stereo. Bring an mp3 player and headphones so that you can still relax to music with the car off before you go to sleep."

      "title": "Include coverings for your car windows.",
      "content": "Include coverings for your car windows. You can get window covering with suction cups that stick on the windows, or you can make your own by cutting window shapes out of sun shades. Bring a few of these along for extra privacy as you sleep in your car. [5] X Expert Source Alex Dimitriu, MD Sleep Medicine & Psychiatry Professional Expert Interview. 16 October 2019. If you don’t have any dedicated window coverings, large T-shirts and towels can work just as well. Bring along some clothespins or tape to attach the covers. If you've forgotten, you can simply close the doors on the cover you're using with it slightly above the door frame; it will hang, caught between the door and the car."

      "title": "Park in a parking lot that’s legal to stay overnight in.",
      "content": "Park in a parking lot that’s legal to stay overnight in. Depending on the area, you may be able to stop in a big box store parking lot, a 24-hour gym, a casino, a hospital, a truck stop, a rest stop, or a campsite. Check for signs that prohibit overnight parking before you park your car, and try to stay away from traffic or store entrances. [6] X Research source You should never sleep on the side of the road or the highway, since that can be dangerous (and it might get you a ticket). Park somewhere reasonably well-lit. Though it might seem counterintuitive to trying to sleep, it's best for your safety to park in a lot with plenty of light. Having a restroom nearby can be super helpful, especially for late-night bathroom trips."

      "title": "Use rechargeable lights instead of your car’s dome light.",
      "content": "Use rechargeable lights instead of your car’s dome light. Keeping your dome light on all night can drain your car battery quickly. Instead, bring a flashlight or a rechargeable light to hang in your car as you get ready for bed. [7] X Research source Even if you’re just going to use the dome light really quick, it’s not worth the risk. You can use the flashlight on your phone, too."

      "title": "Put up your window coverings and spread out your mattress.",
      "content": "Put up your window coverings and spread out your mattress. If you have a sleeping pad or a mattress, now is the time to get it out! When that’s done, you can put up your window coverings for a little extra privacy before you hit the hay. [8] X Research source If you don’t have a mattress or a sleeping pad, that’s okay too. You can either recline your seat all the way back or spread out on the back seat as much as you can. If your back seats fold down, you can spread your mattress out on top of them to lay completely flat. Or, if you have a truck bed with a camping shell, you can use that instead."

      "title": "Bundle up with extra clothes if it’s winter time.",
      "content": "Bundle up with extra clothes if it’s winter time. You can’t keep your car on for the whole night, so it might get a little chilly. Put on an extra sweatshirt, a hat, some sweatpants, and some socks so you don’t get too cold. [9] X Research source If it’s really going to get cold, try turning the car on periodically throughout the night to use the heat. You can turn on your car once or twice an hour for 10 minutes at a time without draining the battery. [10] X Research source And, as long as your tailpipe is clear and you’re not parked indoors, you don’t need to worry about CO2 buildup.

      "title": "Head to a nearby restroom or out into the woods after you wake up.",
      "content": "Head to a nearby restroom or out into the woods after you wake up. This practice will help you wake up feeling fresh and more comfortable, especially if you have a full day of driving ahead of you. Sleeping in a car can sometimes make you feel especially dirty or cramped, so take the time to stretch and clean up. [12] X Research source If you were fortunate enough to stop at a rest stop, take the time to have a shower and brush your teeth at their facilities. Keep some bottled water handy. You can use it in a pinch to wash your face or brush your teeth."

    {
      "title": "Recline your seat if you can.",
      "content": "Recline your seat if you can. While sleeping in the car isn’t the easiest way to get some rest, you’ll have a much easier time of it if you can lean back a little. Try to head up to the front seat and lean back as much as possible. If you can’t recline, use a pillow to cushion your head and lean against the window. Or, if the back seat is free, spread out as much as you can while keeping your seatbelt on."

      "content": "Take off your shoes and get into comfy clothing. Sweatshirts, sweatpants, and warm socks will all help you catch some Zs in the car. Get rid of anything uncomfortable, like jewelry, shoes, or tight clothes. If taking off your shoes isn’t an option, unlace them slightly to make them a bit looser."

      "content": "Block out light with a sleep mask. If the sun is shining in your eyes, it will be much harder to fall asleep. Pull a sleep mask on over your eyes to fall asleep faster. [13] X Research source If you don’t have a sleep mask handy, try pulling a beanie or a hat over your eyes instead. Or, grab a pair of sunglasses to block out the light while looking stylish."

      "content": "Keep out noise with a pair of ear plugs. This is especially important if you’re driving during the day and the other passengers in the car are staying awake. Insert your ear plugs so the other people in the car can keep chatting or listening to music. [14] X Research source If you don’t have ear plugs, headphones work well too!"
