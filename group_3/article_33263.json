Take up to three turns if you roll a double (unless you go to jail for rolling a double three times). For example, if you roll two sixes, then move 12 spaces and perform an action for that space. But then, roll again and move again and perform another action. Move your token the number of spaces you rolled. For example, if you roll a 10, then move 10 spaces Perform an action for the space you land on. For example, if you land on a billboard tile that is available for purchase, then you can purchase it."

Please note, there is no limit to the amount of Empire cards that can be played during a turn.
