      "title": "Wait until she texts or reaches out so she feels in control.",
      "content": "Wait until she texts or reaches out so she feels in control. Aquarians can feel overwhelmed if you call or text a lot. Instead of putting pressure on her, give her a chance to initiate conversations. Resist the urge to text until you hear from her first. You'll be a challenge she can't wait to conquer. Plus, she can't chase you if you aren't a little elusive! [1] X Research source It can be tricky to know how much to interact, so use her communication as a guide. If she texts you once, wait a little bit and reply with a single message. Be a little mysterious! Waiting an hour or 2 to respond to her messages and not giving away all the details about what you’re up to are sure to pique her interest. You’ll know an Aquarius woman is into you when she “texts you and asks you questions” and “tells you what is on [her] mind,” explains Garbis. She might even “tell you [she] was thinking about you.”"

      "title": "Aquarians are attracted to unique people who stand out from the crowd.",
      "content": "Aquarians are attracted to unique people who stand out from the crowd. Try to show her how you're different from everyone else. Maybe you have your own sense of fashion, a unique hobby, or you might have a really interesting way of thinking or expressing yourself. Let her see this! She'll want to get to know your completely original personality. [2] X Research source Think of your most unique characteristics and tell her about them. Maybe you collect something unusual like Monopoly game pieces or you play the bagpipes—the stranger, the better! Do this as soon as you can so she doesn't write you off as being boring or just like everyone else. If you get her to see you differently, she'll see you as a challenge that she wants to learn more about. Garbis completely agrees, saying Aquarian women are attracted to people who aren’t afraid to “be a little bit quirky.” She suggests that you “allow your silly side to show,” “show your creative, innovative side,” and “wear a hint of something wild with your outfit.”"

      "title": "Treat an Aquarius woman like she’s one of your pals.",
      "content": "Treat an Aquarius woman like she’s one of your pals. According to Garbis, Aquarians typically “blend love and friendships,” so “if an Aquarius is friends with you, [she is] interested in you.” She suggests getting into your Aquarius’ friend circle by “adopting hobbies and interests that [she] enjoys,” whether that’s playing video games, reading sci-fi novels, painting, or hiking. Text her and ask her to hang out (semi) regularly so you’re always staying on her mind. Send her funny memes and videos and invite her to unique events she’s sure to enjoy. Garbis agrees that it’s important to “be a good and helpful friend.” She says, “Aquarians are very mental and can sometimes need administrative help.” For instance, she suggests that you “ask if they need food or their laundry picked up from the dry cleaner.”"

      "title": "Keep doing your own thing and wait to be vulnerable with her.",
      "content": "Keep doing your own thing and wait to be vulnerable with her. It can take time for an Aquarius woman to trust and connect with someone, so keep your conversations away from super personal topics as you get to know her. She's attracted to stable, confident personalities , so if you want her to chase you, be bold and self-assured. Pursue your own interests and goals to show her you’re self-sufficient. [3] X Research source Garbis recommends that you “maintain a life of your own to prove that you are a high quality, self-sufficient, and confident person” so your Aquarius knows they won’t need to “always pick up the pieces or dictate how you live your life.” Eyedealism agrees about keeping it light at first, saying “Don't get too personal too fast.” She suggests that you “talk about ideas and concepts” to “get [her] to relax a little bit so you can gain more intimacy with [your] Aquarius.” In time, you can open up with her and have deep, emotional discussions. You'll know she's ready when she's the one to bring up her feelings."

      "title": "Aquarians are pretty unique, so let her know you appreciate her quirks.",
      "content": "Aquarians are pretty unique, so let her know you appreciate her quirks. Garbis says “Aquarians are a little odd at times,” so “they need a partner who gets them enough to allow them to be who they are.” She suggests that you “show interest in her topics of study,” hobbies, and interests. Then, “ask her to explain some of her ideas to you, and let her.” Follow up on the things she tells you about, like asking how her volunteer event turned out or what she liked most about the sci-fi convention she went to. She won’t be able to resist chasing after you when she knows you genuinely care! Aquarius women are so unique because “Aquarius is co-ruled by Saturn and Uranus,” explains Eyedealism. Uranus gives them their “wild and wacky and experimental” personality while Saturn allows them to “be serious” and “take concepts and make them real.”"

      "content": "An Aquarius woman is considerate and she expects you to be, too. Her humanitarian spirit is a big part of her personality, so it's no surprise that she's drawn to people who are kind and empathetic. To let her see this generous side of you, volunteer with something you're passionate about, donate to causes that interest you, or simply be kind to others and help out your friends! [4] X Research source For instance, you might volunteer to tutor kids, deliver food to the elderly, or teach an after-school gardening class."

      "content": "Make your statement smart or witty so it stands out from the crowd. Your Aquarius woman has probably heard her share of pick-up lines, so come up with something completely unique to her. If she just beat you at a game of trivia, you might say, \"I mean, I knew you were smart, but I didn't know you were brilliant.\" [5] X Research source For instance, instead of saying, \"You look great in that outfit,\" say, \"No one but you could pull off a look that's so daring. You're captivating.\" Be flirty so your Aquarius knows you’re into her! Compliment her personality and looks, playfully tease her, and break the touch barrier. Eyedealism explains that “you definitely need to let [an Aquarius] know that you're physically interested in them.” She says, “It's so easy to fall into the friend zone” because “Aquarians are so in their head.”"

      "content": "Bring up philosophical topics so you can impress her with your knowledge. An Aquarius woman isn't just looking for a pretty face! She wants to know that you can match her intellect on a variety of topics, says Eyedealism. Spend time really talking about things that fascinate you—from politics to religion to books and current events; talk with her about anything. She won't be able to wait for your next conversation. She'll probably be turned off if you just stick with small talk. Want to really pique her interest? Ask her out for an evening of conversation. For instance, say, \"I'd love to know what you think about how personalities are formed. Are you in the nature or nurture camp? Let's meet up and talk.\""

      "content": "This shows that you value her intellect and you're a good listener. Aquarians are known for their reasoning. She probably won't want to chase you if she doesn't think you appreciate her mind. By asking what she thinks about something, it shows her that you really want to get to know her. [6] X Research source Use her opinion as a jumping point for a conversation where you share your personal thoughts. She'll also want to see that you're capable of thinking for yourself!"

      "content": "She'll be drawn to your fun, playful personality if you keep her on her toes. Pick her up and take her out to laser tag or challenge her to try something new, like rock climbing. For something memorable but low-key, take her star gazing. Whatever you choose, go for something really unexpected and she'll love you for it! [7] X Research source It's really important to add some excitement if you think she's getting bored. An Aquarian woman isn’t likely to stick around long if she's not thrilled or delighted with the relationship."

      "content": "Stimulate her mind so she's curious and engaged. An Aquarius woman hates to be bored! She's always looking for ways to grow or develop, so she'll love it if you inspire her or show her something new. [8] X Research source For instance, if you're an artist, teach her photography or how to throw pottery. You don't have to be super skilled—she'll appreciate even learning about your hobbies. Garbis agrees, saying an Aquarius woman needs “a good sounding board,” a “good listener,” and “someone who [she] can bounce ideas off of and can inspire them.”"

      "title": "An Aquarius woman doesn't like feeling pressured or anxious.",
      "content": "An Aquarius woman doesn't like feeling pressured or anxious. Your calm, laid-back personality will put her at ease! We know that there will be times when you're stressed out about something—when this happens, resist the urge to lay it all on her. Try not to let things bother you and enjoy your time around her instead. [9] X Research source You may want to take a little time for yourself if something's bothering you. Work on it or reflect on your feelings before hanging out with your Aquarius woman. Try not to get too pushy about your interest or pressuring her into a relationship, either. As an air sign , Garbis says Aquarians “need to be casual about commitment” at first and “need to be able to go with the flow.” So, let her set the pace and follow her lead."

      "content": "Freedom is the name of the game when it comes to an Aquarian! Aquarius women don't like being told what to do, so don't insist on boundaries or labeling your relationship. Give her the space to do her own thing—she'll thrive and love you for it, says Eyedealism. For instance, don't check in with her multiple times a day or call her constantly. She might start to feel like you're controlling her, so give her lots of space. “Aquarius is a sign that needs space,” explains Eyedealism. This sign loves their freedom and doing their own thing, so “you need to give them time and space for intellectual detachment”—it’s nothing to take personally, though!"

To really get her fired up , be surprising—try a new position, spend more time on foreplay, or introduce a new toy. [10] X Research source It's totally fine to ask her what she likes in the bedroom. There might be things she's never tried and would love to do with you!"
