Open Notepad and enter the following lines: FILE \" filename.bin \" BINARY TRACK 01 MODE1/2352 INDEX 01 00:00:00 Change filename.bin to the name of the BIN file you are trying to burn . Keep the quotation marks. Save the file to the same folder as the BIN file. The CUE file should be named exactly the same as the BIN file, except with the .CUE extension. Click File → Save As. Click the \"Save as type\" drop-down menu and select \"All Files\". Give the file a .CUE extension."

      "title": "Install virtual drive software.",
      "content": "Install virtual drive software. A virtual drive will emulate a physical optical drive in your computer, and will allow you to \"mount\" the image file in it. This tricks your computer into thinking a disc has been inserted, and the image is loaded just as if it was running from a disc. There are several virtual drive options available. WinCDEmu is one of the most popular ones available for free. Be careful when installing it, as there are several times where it tries to install browser toolbars and extra software you probably don’t need. Mounting the image will only work if the image is designed to run on a computer. For example, mounting an image of an old console game will not load anything, because the disc originally only works on that console. Windows 8 and OS X have built-in virtual drive software, but the BIN file will need to be converted to an ISO file first."

Browse the CUE file on your hard drive. Remember that the BIN and CUE files need to be in the same folder. Once you've found the CUE file, load it to mount the image."

Use the image file just as you would a CD or DVD that you inserted in your computer. [2] X Research source"
