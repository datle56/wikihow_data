Depending on who you are, and whose birth certificate you are attempting obtain, you will be able to obtain either an \" authorized copy, \" or an \"informational copy\" of the document. In California, “authorized copies” can only be obtained by the person named on the birth certificate, parents of the person named on the certificate and a few other people. The other people who can obtain authorized copies of your birth certificate are: your children, your grandparents, your grandchildren, a member entitled to a record of your birth by court order, a licensed adoption agency complying with Section 3140 or 7603 of the Family Code, a representative of the law (such as a police officer,) your attorney or anyone court appointed to act on your behalf. All other requesters may obtain an informational copy only. An informational copy contains the same information as an authorized copy, but is not a valid document to establish identity. All birth certificates issued—whether authorized or informational—are certified. [2] X Research source"

They will authorize your sworn statement and seal it. [5] X Research source You can access a full and updated database of Notary Publics in California by visiting the Secretary of State's website: https://www.sos.ca.gov/notary/notary-public-listing/ . You can also look up Notary Publics by city, zip code, and county through online search tools. You don’t need to do this if you are only ordering an “informational copy,” but you must indicate this on your application. If you do not state that you want an “informational copy,” and you do not present a notarized statement, your application will be sent back to you and you will have to send it in again with the proper information.
