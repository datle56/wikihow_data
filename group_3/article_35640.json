      "content": "Persistent foamy urine is a sign of protein in your urine. Your kidneys filter protein in your blood, but if they’re functioning normally, the protein stays in your body. So if you have a problem with your kidneys, protein can be released, which can cause foamy urine whenever you go to the restroom. When you have protein in your urine, it’s called proteinuria. Proteinuria can be an early sign of kidney disease or of a condition that’s impacting the way your kidneys function. [5] X Expert Source Robert Dhir, MD Board Certified Urologist & Urological Surgeon Expert Interview. 23 September 2020. Chronic infections like hepatitis or HIV can cause protein to be released in your urine. Taking lots of OTC painkillers, especially NSAIDs like ibuprofen or acetaminophen, can also cause you to have high levels of protein in your urine. Some autoimmune conditions can impact the way your kidneys function, which can cause excessive amounts of protein to be released in your urine. Myeloma, a specific type of blood cancer, can also lead to extra protein in your urine."
