You can do this on your computer if you plan to upload it to your web server via FTP. If you can log in to your web hosting server via SSH or some other method, you can use the server's text editor to create the file—just make sure you do not store it in a folder that's accessible via the web, as it will contain sensitive password information. [1] X Research source For example, let's say you want users who visit your website at https://www.wikihow.com/test to have to enter a password before they can see what's there. Let's also say you upload your web files to this location on your web server: /www/sites/www.wikihow.com . Do not put .htpasswd in that directory. Instead, put it in your home directory (eg., /usr/home/yourusername ). If you don't have access to your regular non-web home directory, contact your web hosting support and tell them that you need to be able to store an .htpasswd file outside of your web directory. They'll know what you're talking about!"

Storing passwords in plain text is unsafe, so you'll need to use an online encryption tool to create a password. [2] X Research source Here's what you'll do: Enter a username into the \"Username\" field. This is the name the person or people accessing the site will enter when logging in. Enter a password for this username. Click Create .htpasswd file . You'll now see the username and encrypted password separated by a colon. For example, if you entered wikihow as the username and badpassword as the password, you'd see: wikihow:$apr1$k7iNRs8E$jL98Y2BEGl2qaF61PuiJ/1 . Highlight the entire line with the mouse, right-click the highlighted text, and then click Copy . The encrypted password is not the password the user will enter to access the site. They'll enter the plain text version. The encryption is only for the server end."
