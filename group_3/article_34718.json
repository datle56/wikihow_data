      "title": "Open your bracelet’s clasp to attach the charms.",
      "content": "Open your bracelet’s clasp to attach the charms. Pry open the barrel or ball clasp, unhook your bracelet’s lobster clasp, or push and twist a bangle clasp to get your bracelet ready for its charms. The way you open your bracelet will depend on the type of clasp that you have. If you remove the ball from a bangle bracelet, make sure you put it in a safe place so you don’t lose it while attaching the charms. If you have a Pandora Reflections bracelet, you won’t need to open the clasp to attach the charms."

      "title": "Screw your charm onto one end of the bracelet.",
      "content": "Screw your charm onto one end of the bracelet. Place your charm onto the end of your bracelet and begin twisting it over the threaded area. Continue twisting until it slides easily onto the bracelet. Some charms may be unthreaded, meaning you can just slide them right onto the bracelet without having to twist. The charm will work similarly to a washer being twisted onto a screw. Once the charm is on the bracelet, it will move loosely along the chain."

    {
      "title": "Continue twisting charms over threaded areas to add to the bracelet.",
      "content": "Continue twisting charms over threaded areas to add to the bracelet. Many Pandora bracelets have three sections separated by two additional threaded areas. To move your charms from one end of the bracelet to another, simply twist the charms over the threaded sections until they move freely. Newer Pandora bracelets may not have the threaded sections."

    {
      "title": "Clip your mesh bracelet’s charms directly onto the bracelet.",
      "content": "Clip your mesh bracelet’s charms directly onto the bracelet. If you have a Pandora Reflections bracelet, you don’t have to undo the clasp to attach the charms. Use your fingernails to open the clasp on the charm, situating your nail into the notch. Once the charm is open, clip it around the mesh bracelet, pressing until it’s firmly in place. Once you snap the charm onto the metal mesh, it should stay in place without moving on the bracelet."

    {
      "title": "Remove the charms the same way you attached them.",
      "content": "Remove the charms the same way you attached them. If you twisted your charm onto the open clasp of your bracelet, you’ll twist it off the same way. If you clipped your charm directly onto the bracelet, simply open the notch in the charm to remove it. However you attached the charm to your bracelet is how you’ll carefully take it off.

    {
      "title": "Locate the clasp on your bracelet.",
      "content": "Locate the clasp on your bracelet. Most Pandora bracelets will either have a barrel clasp or a clasp that looks like a regular ball. If your bracelet doesn’t have any charms on it, the clasp will be very recognizable. Look for a raised notch on the clasp that you’ll use to open the bracelet. Your bracelet may have a lobster clasp instead of a barrel or ball. If you have a bangle bracelet, these won’t have a raised notch that you need to open."

    {
      "title": "Insert your fingernail into the notch to pry the clasp open.",
      "content": "Insert your fingernail into the notch to pry the clasp open. Most classic styles of Pandora bracelets, such as barrel clasps and ball clasps, will have a notch in the clasp. Situate your fingernail in the raised notch or groove, using a small amount of force to pry open the clasp. Use a Pandora clasp opener if you don’t want to use your fingers. Avoid using a regular tool to open your bracelet so you don’t damage it. Pandora Reflections mesh bracelets will also have a notch, even though they look different."

    {
      "title": "Unhook the fastener if your bracelet has a lobster clasp.",
      "content": "Unhook the fastener if your bracelet has a lobster clasp. If your Pandora bracelet has a normal jewelry fastener that’s held together using a spring, use your fingernail to unhook the clasp from the chain hole. Make sure the fastener is securely attached by fitting the lobster clasp into the small hole at the end of the chain. Lobster clasps look very similar to the claw of a lobster."

      "title": "Open a Pandora bangle bracelet by pushing and twisting the ball.",
      "content": "Open a Pandora bangle bracelet by pushing and twisting the ball. If you have a bangle bracelet, push the ball at the edge of the bracelet forward, turning it until it pops off. To reattach the ball, you’ll push it back on and twist until you hear a small click or feel that it’s secure. [2] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Press the clasp around the chain to close it.",
      "content": "Press the clasp around the chain to close it. Once you’ve finished adding or taking off charms and you’re ready to close the bracelet, put the chain back in the clasp. Press it until you hear a light click, making sure it’s secure. Lightly jingle the clasp to make sure the bracelet won’t pop open."
