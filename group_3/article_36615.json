      "content": "Pretreat your stain by soaking in cool or warm water. Thoroughly moisten the stain by pouring the water over the fabric or sponging it on. Stains are actually created by perspiration reacting to the aluminum found in most deodorants and antiperspirants. The combination of the protein found in your sweat combining with the aluminum creates the yellow stain. As the stain is protein based, immediate exposure to hot water sets in the stain. [1] X Research source However, hot water is best for actually removing the stain. After submerging in cool water and treating with the remedy of your choice it is advised to wash in hot water to purge the remaining soils."

      "content": "Mix water with the cleaning agent in a separate container. No matter which of the previous products you have chosen, in order to activate the cleaning agents you must mix with warm water. Ratios and mixing specifications for each of the products are listed below. OxiClean, vodka, hydrogen peroxide, white vinegar, and dish detergent should all be mixed in a container at a 1-1 ratio. Baking soda should be mixed to water at a 3-1 ratio. Aspirin pills must first be crushed. Use 3-4 pills and then mix into a bowl of warm water. See How to Remove Sweat Stains With Aspirin for more specific instructions. Keep aspirin out of reach of children, and be careful not to inhale any of its particles as it's being crushed."

      "content": "Mix until the product has completely combined with the water, either creating a liquid or a paste. After the ingredients have been properly combined you will discover which form your solution has taken. Baking soda will produce a paste. Vodka, hydrogen peroxide, white vinegar, and aspirin will dissolve into a liquid. You will be soaking the garment or stained area in this mixture, so be sure to have a large enough container for the task. OxiClean and dish detergent will dissolve into water with the given 1-1 ratio. However, you can also create a paste by using more OxiClean or detergent at a 3-1 ratio. Some prefer the paste solution, believing it fights harder against tough stains. [2] X Research source"

You will start to see the stain fade away. Although the baking soda paste works well on its own, you can also try pouring vinegar over the stain while you scrub. The vinegar will immediately bubble up, so use caution. Baking soda is a base while vinegar is an acid, so the two combined produce an explosion of sorts in the form of bubbles. This reaction’s abrasive qualities helps eliminate residue while the bubbles lift the stain out of the fabric. [3] X Research source"

You really only need to soak the stained portion, but you can submerge the entire garment if you like. For lesser stains, soaking may not be necessary. Pour the solution into a spray bottle and apply to stained areas. Generously spray and allow the solution to soak in before washing as usual. If you have sensitive skin you may want to wear rubber gloves for the following steps, as the cleaning agents contain strong chemicals. Stay away from bleach products when soaking clothing, as the chemical oxidize dyes which could lead to discoloration.

Lighter stains may only need to sit for 15 to 30 minutes, while dark stains can sit for a few hours, possibly even overnight. [6] X Research source Monitor your garment. If the stain fades quickly, remove from the soak. If the stain barely fades in an hour, leave overnight. If a garment has been stained for a long period of time, it will be harder to remove.
