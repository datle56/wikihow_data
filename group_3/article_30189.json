      "content": "Understand your assignment. If you are building an animal cell for a science fair or as part of a homework project, you will have to know what the rules and expectations are. There is a wide variety of animal cell models you can build, and you want to do the best job you can. Be sure that you are absolutely clear about what is expected of you. Some key questions to ask yourself (or your teacher) include: Are you supposed to come up with your own design for an animal cell, or are you supposed to follow your teacher's instructions? Do the cells have to be edible or non-edible? Which components of an animal cell must be included? How large must the cell model be? When must the cell model be completed? Must the cell model be 3D?"

      "title": "Know the parts of an animal cell.",
      "content": "Know the parts of an animal cell. One of the most important parts of an animal cell model is correctly representing each of the parts of a cell. Remember that animal cells and plant cells look very different from one another: they have different parts, and animal cells are not as symmetrical as plant cells are. Be sure that you are familiar with the individual components of a cell, including their function, where in the cell they are located, and what they look like. All of this will help make your model more accurate. The parts of an animal cell you might represent include: Nucleus. The nucleus is in the center of the cell. DNA is contained here, and the nucleus also governs protein synthesis. [1] X Research source Nucleolus. This is an organelle where RNA is produced. It is contained within the cell's nucleus. [2] X Research source It is usually a slightly darker color than the nucleus. Nuclear membrane. This is a thin membrane surrounding the nucleus. [3] X Research source Centrosomes. These help create microtubules and are located just outside the nucleus. [4] X Research source Cell membrane. The cell membrane is the thin outside barrier of the cell, made out of protein and fat. [5] X Research source It allows certain materials though while keeping other organic materials safely within the cell. Cytoplasm. This substance is contained by the cell outside of the nucleus and within the cell membrane. It contains the other organelles of the cell that govern cell function, and it has a jellylike consistency. [6] X Research source Lysosomes. These organelles digest nutrients, and they are round in shape. [7] X Research source Ribosomes. Ribosomes are very small and grain like in appearance. They aid protein synthesis. [8] X Research source Golgi bodies. These look like a stack of flat circles, and they help construct membranes for other organelles. Vacuoles. These are asymmetrical sacs filled with fluid and surrounded by a membrane. They are used to store waste material. Endoplasmic reticulum. This is a set of connected, folded tubes within the cell, used to transport material from one part of the cell to another. An endoplasmic reticulum that is covered with ribosomes is referred to as a rough endoplasmic reticulum and one that is not covered with ribosomes is a smooth endoplasmic reticulum. Smooth endoplasmic reticulum branches off from the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Mitochondria. Mitochondria convert glucose into energy for the cell. They can be round or rod-shaped.

      "content": "Draw a map of an animal cell. If you don't have a worksheet labeling the parts of a cell and their appearance, you should draw one yourself . You will need a thorough and complete map of an animal cell to help you plan, design, and execute your model. Be sure that the map is large enough for you to label each cell component clearly and accurately. Keep this diagram with you at all times so that you can be sure that your cell model is correct."

      "title": "Start early.",
      "content": "Start early. Depending on the type of model you build, you might require a lot of time to create and assemble your model. For example, clay has to harden, gelatin must be given time to set, and you might have to go shopping for extra materials. Give yourself plenty of time to plan out and construct the best possible cell model you can."

      "content": "Purchase supplies at a grocery store. Edible animal cell models can be made easily with common and inexpensive ingredients at local supermarkets and grocery stores. You have some flexibility in the specific ingredients you use to represent cell components. However, in general, what you require is a gelatin base that is light in color to represent cytoplasm, a plastic bag to represent a cell membrane, and various candies, fruits, and nuts to represent organelles and other cell components. In general, some good ingredients to purchase could include: A light-colored gelatin mix, such as a lemon-flavored jello. You can also purchase a clear or light-colored fruit juice (like lemonade or limeade) along with unflavored gelatin packets. This will eventually be your cytoplasm. It is important that you pick a light color so that the other cell components will stand out. A large, pitted fruit to represent a nucleus (the fruit) and the nucleolus (the pit). Depending on how large your model is, you might use a plum, peach, apricot, or cherry. Small, round candies or fruits. These will represent your lysosomes. For example, M&Ms, Skittles, gumballs, or grapes might serve as effective lysosomes. [10] X Research source Oval- or rod-shaped candies or fruits. These will represent your mitochondria. Raisins, craisins, Mike & Ike's, or dried apricots would all work, depending on the size of your model. Slightly larger, irregular candies or fruits. These will represent your vacuoles. Small banana slices, jawbreakers, or gummy rings are good options. [11] X Research source Very small, grain-shaped candies. These will represent your ribosomes, so they must be considerably smaller than your other cell components. Some good possibilities could include: Tic-Tacs, Nerds, or extra-small jelly beans. A round, dense piece of candy. This will represent your centrosome. Gumdrops or Gushers could make an effective centrosome. Long, stringy pieces of candy. These will represent the endoplasmic reticulum. If you want to be very precise, you can buy one type that is coated in sugar (to represent the rough endoplasmic reticulum) and one type that is smooth (to represent the smooth endoplasmic reticulum). Some excellent options include gummy worms, sour worms, and various kinds of licorice rope. [12] X Research source Long, flat candy or fruit roll-up. When you fold up a long, flat piece of candy or fruit snack, you will have an excellent representation of Golgi bodies. Try bubblegum tape, fruit roll-ups, or other kinds of fruit leather to create this organelle. [13] X Research source"

      "content": "Line a bowl or large cup with a clear plastic bag. In many projects, the clear plastic bag represents the cell membrane. It is important that it be clear so that your cell model is perfectly visible. Find a medium-size bowl or large cup--such as a vessel that can hold about a gallon of liquid--and line it with a clear plastic bag. This will serve as the mold for your gelatin as well as the outside of your cell model."

      "content": "Prepare your gelatin. Most jello and gelatin packets will have clear instructions on the best way to prepare your gelatin mold . It is a good idea to follow these instructions closely, with one exception: put in slightly less liquid than the recipe calls for. This will help your gelatin model remain tougher and more solid, which will help your cell model remain intact. In general, the instructions on how to prepare a gelatin are: Dissolve the gelatin in boiling water in a heat-proof bowl, stirring carefully. Add cold water equal to the amount of boiling water. Let the gelatin cool slightly. Carefully pour the mixture into the lined bowl you prepared. Seal the bag and place it in the refrigerator until it is not-quite-set (45 minutes to an hour). Remove the bag from the refrigerator when the gelatin is stiff enough to suspend your cell components but soft enough to insert fruits and candies deep within the mold."

      "content": "Purchase your materials. In order to make a 3D cell model out of cake, you will need to have the right materials to make the structure of the cell (the cake itself), material for cytoplasm (a light-colored frosting or jelly), and 3D components for the cell parts (nuts, fruits, candies, or molded fondant). You have a lot of flexibility with the design of your cake and the specific ingredients you use to represent the parts of a cell. However, in general, you will want to have the following ingredients on hand: [15] X Research source Enough cake batter to make a two-layer round cake. You can choose to bake any flavor of cake you wish, in a light or a dark color. You could even choose to bake one layer of each. This is the base of your cell. A cupcake top, a large piece of fruit, or a round cookie cutter to create the shape of your nucleus in the center of your cake. At least two different colors of frosting. You could choose to use two different flavors (such as lemon and raspberry) or you could add food coloring to a light-colored frosting to create a second color. You should use the lighter-colored frosting as your cytoplasm on top of the cake, and the darker color as the cell membrane to the sides of your cake. [16] X Research source Fondant and food coloring. If you wish to sculpt your own cell components out of fondant, you can purchase fondant in a store along with various kinds of food coloring to differentiate your organelles from one another. It is also possible to make your own fondant . If you do not wish to sculpt your cell components, you can choose appropriately shaped fruit, candy, and nuts to represent them instead. Small, round candies or fruits. These will represent your lysosomes. For example, M&Ms, Skittles, gumballs, or grapes might serve as effective lysosomes. [17] X Research source Oval- or rod-shaped candies, nuts, or fruits. These will represent your mitochondria. Raisins, craisins, Mike & Ike's, almonds, or dried apricots would all work, depending on the size of your model. Slightly larger, irregular candies, nuts, or fruits. These will represent your vacuoles. Small banana slices, jawbreakers, brazil nuts, or gummy rings are good options. [18] X Research source Very small, grain-shaped candies or sprinkles. These will represent your ribosomes, so they must be considerably smaller than your other cell components. Some good possibilities could include: Tic-Tacs, Nerds, and various kinds of sprinkles or funfetti. A round, dense piece of candy. This will represent your centrosome.
