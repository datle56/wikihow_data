      "title": "Use earplugs.",
      "content": "Use earplugs. This tried and true method is cheap and easy. Look for earplugs at a pharmacy or department store and pop them in at night to block out some of the unwanted sounds. Earplugs come made from different materials, such as foam, rubber, and plastic. Make sure to follow the instructions on your package to figure out how to place your earplugs in effectively. If you are prone to ear infections, ask your doctor before using ear plugs. To reduce the risk of infection, always wash your hands before handling the earplugs and clean reusable earplugs regularly. Don’t push them too far into your ears and make sure that you can hear smoke detector and carbon monoxide alarms while you are wearing the earplugs in case any emergency arises.

      "content": "Find a source of white noise. White noise is the kind of background noise made by television static or a fan--easily ignorable, but soothing at the same time. A good source of white noise can help cancel out the most stubborn of snorers. You can turn on a fan, an air conditioner, or another electronic device that makes white noise. You can also invest in a white noise machine, which you can purchase online. [2] X Research source If you can't find a source of white noise, look for videos or audio clips online that can provide it."

      "content": "Listen to music on your headphones. If you have headphones and a device like an iPod or iPhone, you’ve already got your own personal noise-cancelling device. Play some relaxing music to block out the sound of snoring and help you nod off at night. [3] X Research source Opt for slow, soothing music. Louder, faster music, though effective at drowning out snores, may make it even more difficult to sleep. If you have an account on a website like Spotify, see if you can find any playlists specifically designed to help with sleep."

      "content": "Change how you think about the sound. If you think of snoring as an annoyance, it is more likely to bother you. Try to think of the sound as a soothing noise that can lull you to sleep. This may help you remain calm when you wake up in the middle of the night. Try to listen closely to snoring and pay attention to its rhythm. The very source of your troubles can actually help you fall back asleep. [6] X Research source It may take some practice before this method works, so have patience. It may be awhile before you learn to embrace the sound of snoring. Meditating quietly can be a great way to block out noise. [7] X Expert Source Alex Dimitriu, MD Sleep Medicine & Psychiatry Professional Expert Interview. 16 October 2019."
