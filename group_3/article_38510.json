      "content": "Durability is displayed in a color-changing bar on the item. Most tools , weapons, or pieces of armor that have been used at least once will have a durability bar at the bottom of their icon that changes color as the item's durability decreases. The bar changes from green, to yellow, to orange, to red. Once the bar is empty, the item will break very soon. One exception is items with the \"unbreakable\" tag. These items will not break and do not show a durability bar, even when used. Buckets, clocks, compasses, leads, spy glasses, and recovery compasses don't have durability. When using a bow, fishing rod, carrot on a stick, flint and steel, warped fungi on a stick, brush, or elytra to break a block, they will not lower in durability. These tools have their durability lowered in other ways."

But, when you press it with H , it will activate the advanced tool tips and display extra info in the tooltips for your items, including the numeric durability value of your tools, weapons, or armor. [1] X Research source If you have a smaller keyboard, first press Fn + F3 , then release Fn . While still holding down F3 , press H . [2] X Research source If the shortcut doesn't work, try it again with your inventory closed. Users have reported this shortcut doesn't work if you're in your inventory when you press it. If the shortcut still doesn't work, go to your options.txt file in your Minecraft folder. Search for advancedItemTooltips and change false to true . Save the file, then try again. If you're on Bedrock Edition, this shortcut will unfortunately not work."

Currently, there is no way to view the specific durability values of your items in standard Bedrock edition. But, you can download a resource pack like Durability Viewer to gain access to those features. Once you’ve downloaded the resource pack, open Settings and scroll down to Global Resources. From there, go to My Packs, locate Durability Viewer, and click Activate. [3] X Research source To specify the range of your durability values, click the gear icon next to the Activate button and scroll through the four settings. The four settings for the durability range include: Round durability numbers above 500. Round durability numbers in the thousands. Round durability numbers in the hundreds & thousands. Show all durability numbers."

These mods approach durability in different ways, giving you plenty of options that work best for your playstyle. Some of the most popular ones include: Durability Tooltip adds durability to your item tooltips without having to do any keyboard shortcuts. Durability101 adds an item's numeric durability value above its durability bar. Durability Notifier notifies you when your item is low on durability. Durability Show adds a section to your HUD that shows the remaining durability of your armor, tools, and weapons."

Using a tool for its intended use usually counts as 1 use. For example, using an axe to break a block of wood or using a hoe to till grass counts as 1 use. But using a tool for a purpose it isn’t intended for, like using an axe, pickaxe, shovel, or hoe to hit a mob, counts as two uses. [8] X Research source For the most part, breaking blocks that break immediately count as 0 uses. If a tool is used to break a block but you stop before the block is broken, it does not count as a use. Using a specialty tool (i.e. flint and steel, fishing rods, etc.) for anything other than their intended purpose usually counts as 0 uses. But, breaking a block with shears counts as 1 use. Specialty tools may use up more uses depending on how you use them. For example, the fishing rod can use anywhere from 1-5 uses, depending on how you use it."

Bows also calculate durability differently than swords. When you shoot an arrow, your bow loses 1 use, but when you hit a mob with your sword, you lose 2 uses. [9] X Research source When you break a block with your sword, you lose 2 uses. When you shoot a crossbow, you lose 1 use.

Mending is a rare enchantment that increases the durability of your item as you gain XP, making it so your item is virtually indestructible as long as you are gaining XP. You can obtain the mending enchantment by trying your luck and enchanting your item or enchanting a book. You can also search villages to see if one of the houses has an enchanted book with Mending. [13] X Research source Churchill suggests you reach thirty levels of XP before enchanting tools, as they give you the highest chance at the strongest enchantments. According to Churchill, a level thirty enchantment only takes away three levels of XP. So, once you reach level thirty once, it’s much easier to reach it again after enchanting items."
