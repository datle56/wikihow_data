Your intuition is a force to be reckoned with—and if you’re seeing a bird fly into your window, it could be a sign that you aren’t quite listening to it enough. Pay attention to what conversation you're having. Pay attention to what you had on your mind. Take a moment to check in with yourself and see how you’re feeling; if something seems “off,” take a deeper dive into that feeling to figure out what’s going on. See what type of energy your body is giving off before making a decision. If you’re feeling tight and tense about something, it could be a sign to step back from whatever is stressing you out. If you’re feeling more open and spirited, it could be a sign to approach a situation with open arms. [6] X Research source"

[7] X Research source Brainstorm a list of small changes you might make to your daily routine. If you’d like to be healthier, for instance, but don’t want to go to the gym, you might cut back on electronics time and replace it with a walk around the neighborhood."

All in all, this can contribute to a very untimely collision for the bird."
