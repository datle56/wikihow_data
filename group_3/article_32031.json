      "content": "Code P0456 means “EVAP system leak detected (very small leak).” This diagnostic trouble code (DTC) indicates that there is a small leak in your evaporative emissions (EVAP) system. [1] X Research source While you’re driving, your engine control module (ECM) performs specific tests to ensure your EVAP system is holding the correct amount of vacuum pressure. If that pressure drops below a certain point, the ECM will trigger a check engine light that throws code P0456. [2] X Research source More serious leaks might show another trouble code, like P0455.

      "title": "There could be a leak in your evaporative emission system.",
      "content": "There could be a leak in your evaporative emission system. Your EVAP system is a pressurized system that keeps gas vapor from leaking out of your vehicle. If there’s a leak in that system, toxic fumes can be released into the atmosphere, causing pollution. [5] X Research source When it’s working properly, the EVAP system directs those fumes into your intake manifold so they can be burned up with your fuel."

      "title": "Faulty seals, sensors, or solenoids could also be to blame.",
      "content": "Faulty seals, sensors, or solenoids could also be to blame. Your EVAP system needs to be tightly sealed all the way throughout. If a seal in the EVAP system is leaking, you’ll likely see code P0456. There could also be an issue with the solenoids that control how much fuel vapor is held in your engine. [6] X Research source The problem could also be with the engine control module (ECM) or sensors that monitor your EVAP system. In some cases, the problem may be with the software running on your vehicle’s computer. A software update may fix the issue. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Tighten or replace your gas cap first. If you take your car to the mechanic with code P0456, the first thing a mechanic will do is to try tightening your gas cap. [8] X Research source Save yourself the trip and try this yourself—tighten the fuel cap securely by hand, then check whether the code is gone after you drive for a few days. [9] X Research source Don’t over-tighten the gas cap, as you could crack the cap or damage the seal. If the gas cap doesn’t seal when you tighten it by hand, replace it with a new one.. [10] X Research source Use an OEM gas cap, or one provided by your vehicle’s manufacturer, to ensure a precise fit."

      "content": "See a mechanic if the code doesn’t go away. If you’ve tried tightening and replacing your gas cap and the code doesn't clear, or if you smell fuel or notice any unusual sounds, smells, or driving issues, bring your car in to a certified mechanic to have the issue properly diagnosed. [11] X Research source The first thing the mechanic may do is check for any technical service bulletins (TSBs) for your vehicle. TSBs are notices sent out by vehicle manufacturers or safety organizations that could indicate a part recall or common failure, which indicate if there could be a known cause specific to your make and model. [12] X Research source For instance, a faulty power control module (PCM) could cause an erroneous P0456 code. In this case, the mechanic would probably recommend replacing the PCM first, although they may run other diagnostic tests to be sure."

      "content": "A mechanic will visually inspect your vehicle to try to find the leak. If your mechanic suspects that code P0456 is actually caused by a leak in your EVAP system, they’ll typically perform a close inspection of your fuel cap and your evaporative emissions hoses. Sometimes, the cause of an EVAP leak will be obvious, like a faulty seal around your gas cap, a damaged hose, or a cracked fuel tank. In this case, further testing might not be needed."

      "content": "A mechanic will perform pressure tests to locate the leak if needed. If the mechanic can’t find the cause of the leak with a visual inspection, they may use a specialized hand pump to identify where the system isn’t holding vacuum pressure. They’ll disconnect the parts of your EVAP system one at a time and connect them to the pump. If one of the parts isn’t holding pressure, they’ve found the source of the leak. [13] X Research source This can be time-consuming and may involve removing the fuel tank assembly from your vehicle. The longer it takes the technician to locate the leak, the more you’ll likely pay in labor costs."

      "title": "A mechanic may also perform a smoke test to locate a leak.",
      "content": "A mechanic may also perform a smoke test to locate a leak. Some mechanics will also hook the EVAP system up to a smoke machine. If the system is properly pressurized, the smoke will stay in the EVAP system—so if they see smoke coming up from the vehicle, they can identify an EVAP leak. They can then locate where the smoke is emerging to pinpoint the source of the leak. [14] X Research source The technicians may need to perform multiple smoke tests, removing parts of your vehicle during the process."

      "content": "They’ll repair the leak or replace the faulty parts. Once your mechanic locates the source of the EVAP leak, they’ll either repair or replace the part as needed. If the pressure and smoke tests didn’t find a leak, they may suggest replacing the engine control module (ECM), which is the control system that monitors the EVAP system. [15] X Research source Your mechanic may be able to use a special tool to force your ECM to run the EVAP test again. If the problem is fixed, this should clear code P0456. [16] X Research source"

A new OEM gas cap —meaning one that’s manufactured specifically for your vehicle by your manufacturer, rather than a generic one—can cost anywhere from $10 to $20. It’s an inexpensive fix, and a good first option if you’re trying to clear code P0456."

Small EVAP leaks can be hard to find—a large leak might have an obvious cause, like a broken hose or cracked fuel tank, but a smaller leak could be caused by something as tiny as a pinpoint hole. Finding the exact cause of P0456 can sometimes require extensive testing, so the diagnostic part of your repair bill could be as much as $200 or more."

      "content": "The repair can cost less than $50 or more than $500 for parts. Sometimes fixing code P0456 is as simple as replacing a small piece of hose or a rubber gasket—parts that don’t cost very much. However, if you have a cracked fuel tank or damage to the fuel filler neck, you could be looking at several hundred dollars in parts. [17] X Research source The cost of labor will vary depending on where you live and which repair shop you choose."

      "content": "Fuel leaks are a serious issue, but the fix could be simple. If you have a leak in your EVAP system, your car could be emitting toxic fumes. If the problem isn’t fixed, the leak could worsen, and you might notice an increased smell of fumes and a decrease in your fuel efficiency. [18] X Research source If you’re seeing code P0456 because your fuel cap is loose, the problem isn’t serious—you just need to tighten your fuel cap and the code should go away."

      "content": "You can still drive unless you smell fuel or notice engine trouble. Because a loose fuel cap is one of the more common reasons you’ll see P0456, you don’t have to park your car right away. Try tightening the gas cap, then drive as usual for 2 or 3 days to see if the code clears. If it doesn’t, replace the gas cap. [19] X Research source If the code is still there after a few days, take your car to a mechanic to have the problem diagnosed. P0456 indicates a very small leak, so it’s unlikely you’ll notice any unusual smells or engine trouble. But if you do, stop driving and consult a mechanic."

Once you fix the problem and the EVAP system is sealed, the code will clear automatically. [20] X Research source Because code P0456 is a “permanent” code, it often can’t be cleared with a scan tool. In most cases, it will only clear once your car successfully passes the EVAP pressure test. [21] X Research source"
