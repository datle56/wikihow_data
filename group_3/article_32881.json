      "content": "You can tan at Planet Fitness if you have a Black Card membership. Planet Fitness also requires members to be 18 or older to use their tanning beds. Tanning is unlimited for Black Card members, but their policy is that you cannot tan more than once every 24 hours. Some locations may have additional rules or restrictions, so be sure to ask your local gym for details. [1] X Research source Cost of a Black Card membership: $24.99 per month. Perks included with a Black Card membership: Unlimited guest privileges Access to any Planet Fitness location Unlimited use of massage chairs Half-price cooler drinks Unlimited use of tanning beds (once per 24 hours) Exclusive discounts and special offers from Planet Fitness partners [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Be a Black Card member and check in at the front desk. If you haven’t already, download the Planet Fitness app and set up your Black Card membership account (a Planet Fitness staff member can help you, if needed). Every time you visit Planet Fitness, you are required to check in at the front desk with your digital keytag. The digital keytag is a QR code accessible via the Planet Fitness app. [3] X Research source There will be at least one (or more) keytag scanners at the front desk. For touchless check-in, just hold your phone up to the scanner until you hear a “beep” which means you’re all set. If you run into any issues, ask a front desk member to scan your keytag or give them your phone number so they can log you in manually. Availability varies based on each gym’s hours of operation. If your Planet Fitness location is open with staff present, you can use the tanning beds."

      "content": "Tell one of the front desk staff members that you want to tan. The staff member may ask to scan your keytag a second time to log you in for a tanning session. If there’s no one at the front desk, just wait and someone should be with you shortly. You have to speak with a staff member before being able to access the tanning beds."

      "title": "Choose the type of bed you want and how long you want to use it.",
      "content": "Choose the type of bed you want and how long you want to use it. Planet Fitness may offer different types of tanning beds ( stand-up , lay-down, or hybrid) depending on location, so tell the front desk staff what you prefer and ask what their time limits are. Time limits may vary, but stand-up beds are usually 9-10 minutes max and lay-down beds are usually 12 minutes max. For example, you might say “I’d like to use the stand-up tanning for 5 minutes,” or “I’d like to use the lay-down tanning bed for 10 minutes.” How long should I tan per session? If this is your first tanning session, go with 5 minutes max. You can go higher once you know how your body responds. Keep in mind that 10 minutes in a tanning bed is equivalent to about 2 hours in the sun! [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Go to your assigned tanning booth, take off your clothes, and get in. Typically, you’ll have 3-5 minutes to prepare before the tanning bed turns on, although some locations may allow you to set the timer yourself. Take off your clothes and jewelry, put on your tanning goggles , and get into the tanning bed (you’ll either lay down or stand up, depending on the bed type). If you’re using any kind of tanning lotion or oil, apply that before you get in. A Planet Fitness staff member will ask to see your tanning goggles before you use the bed–eye protection is required for your safety. If you don’t have the proper eyewear, most Planet Fitness locations will sell you what you need.

      "content": "Wipe down the bed before you leave to sanitize it, if required. Some Planet Fitness locations have self-cleaning machines that automatically sanitize after each use. Others will ask that you sanitize the bed yourself–there will be a sanitizing spray and paper towels inside the booth. Give it a spritz, wipe the bed down, and toss the paper towels in the trash. To care for your skin after tanning , remember to moisturize and drink plenty of water to rehydrate."

      "title": "Stand-up beds offer shorter sessions with more intense UV light.",
      "content": "Stand-up beds offer shorter sessions with more intense UV light. The high-intensity UV bulbs used in stand-up tanning booths give off stronger rays compared to lay-down tanning beds. As a result, you can get a deeper tan more quickly using a stand-up booth. Stand-up booths may also provide a more full coverage tan since your entire body is evenly exposed to the light. [7] X Research source Cons: The high intensity UV bulbs are more likely to burn you or cause skin damage in the long run. Stand-up booths can also be more challenging for people with mobility issues."

      "title": "Lay-down tanning beds are more relaxing but require longer sessions.",
      "content": "Lay-down tanning beds are more relaxing but require longer sessions. Laying down (especially after a tough workout) in a warm tanning bed is a relaxing experience for many people. The UV bulbs in lay-down beds aren't as strong as stand-up booths, though, so you'll need longer sessions to get the same results. That said, the weaker bulbs are also less likely to cause skin damage over time than the more intense bulbs. [8] X Research source Lay-down tanning beds are also easier to use for people with mobility issues. Cons: Your tan may be less even since parts of your body are in direct contact with the surface (which compresses areas, resulting in skin folds/crevices)."

      "title": "Either way is fine, but some people say tanning after a workout is better.",
      "content": "Either way is fine, but some people say tanning after a workout is better. Some people like to tan before working out because they like how the UV light warms up their muscles. Others say that tanning beds make them feel too relaxed (or even sleepy) before their workout, so tanning post-workout is better for them. At the end of the day, it’s entirely up to you and your preferences! [9] X Research source Some theorize that tanning post-workout may help skin absorb more UV light because the skin’s pores are open after exercise, although this hasn’t been proven."

      "content": "Tanning at Planet Fitness offers better perks than a regular tanning salon. If you’re looking for a one-stop shop where you can get in a good workout and use amenities like tanning beds and massage chairs, Planet Fitness is clearly the better choice over a regular tanning salon. If you’re trying to choose between using a tanning salon or Planet Fitness facilities, consider these points: Planet Fitness offers the convenience of tanning before or after your workout. The Black Card membership is a cost-effective option with multiple perks. Planet Fitness is a safe, controlled tanning environment with staff on hand. Some users feel increased body confidence with a more tanned appearance. Some users feel more relaxed after a hard workout if they tan afterward."

Planet Fitness is a gym, but that doesn’t mean their tanning beds are any safer or healthier than regular tanning beds. Planet Fitness tanning beds are the same ones that regular tanning salons use. Using tanning beds always comes with a few health risks, just like spending time out in the sun. For example, tanning can increase the risk of developing skin cancer and prematurely age your skin. [10] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Dermatology Professional organization made of over 20,000 certified dermatologists Go to source Most medical practitioners advise skipping tanning beds for these reasons, but it’s up to you to weigh the pros and cons for yourself. Contrary to popular belief, tanning beds are not safer than sun exposure. The risks are the same, except tanning beds expose you to more intense UV light than the sun. This means tanning beds are more likely to cause skin damage and skin cancer than regular sun exposure. [11] X Research source"

Tanning beds are damaging to your skin in the long-term and using them may increase your risk of skin cancer—there's no way around that fact. However, there are a few things you can do to have the safest experience possible, including: [12] X Research source Limit the frequency of your sessions (once a week max) Use the shortest exposure time possible (especially at first) Always wear tanning goggles to protect your eyes Never use regular tanning oil or accelerator—only use products formulated specifically for using in tanning beds."

Spray tans look great and they're definitely healthier than tanning beds, but most Planet Fitness locations don't offer this service.
