      "content": "Review rounding on a number line (optional). Let's ignore the decimals for a moment and try rounding to tens instead. Draw a number line from 10 to 20. The numbers on the left half of the line (like 13 or 11) are closer to 10, so they round to 10. The numbers on the right half (like 16 or 17) are closer to 20, so they round to 20. Rounding with decimals can seem confusing, but it's really the same process. You could relabel your number line as \"0.10, 0.11, 0.12, ..., 0.19, 0.2\" and you'd have a number line for rounding to the nearest tenth. [1] X Research source"

The digits to the right of the hundredths do not matter when you're rounding to the nearest tenth. They represent \"extra stuff\" too small to make a difference."

If it is, \"round up\" by adding 1 to the tenths place digit. Get rid of all digits after the tenths place, and you have your answer. [5] X Research source Example 1: The number 7.86 has a 6 in the hundredths place. Round up by adding 1 to the tenths place to get 7.9 , removing the digits to the right."

For example, 4.03 rounded to the nearest tenth is 4.0 . This gives people a better idea of the accuracy of your number. Just writing \"4\" isn't wrong, but it hides the fact that you were working with decimals."

For example, -12.56 round to -12.6, and -400.333 rounds to -400.3. [7] X Research source Be careful about using the phrases \"round down\" and \"round up.\" If you look at a number line for negative numbers, you'll see that rounding -12.56 to -12.6 moves left, so that's \"rounding down\" even though you increased the tenth digit by 1."

Here are three examples: [8] X Research source 7192403242401.29 rounds to 7192403242401.3 5.0620138424107 rounds to 5.1 9000.30001 rounds to 9000.3"
