      "content": "Research your specific location for rules about signage. Different states and municipalities usually have different rules about how to post No Trespassing signs and what they mean. Rules about how signs look, sign size, wording, and where they can be legally posted also vary by location, so be sure to research thoroughly before proceeding. For example, your area may require signs to be a minimum size or there may be a minimum font size for them to legally apply to trespassers. Most areas will require the signage to be clearly legible and visible in order to be enforced. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Count how many property entrances you have before purchasing signs. The number of signs you need usually depends on the characteristics of your property. Road entrances, property lines, public roads, and water lines are ideal places to post signage. Most locations have limits on how many signs you can have and how close together the signs can be on your property. If you need to, walk the perimeter of your property with a notebook and pen to tally up how many signs you need. [2] X Research source Most properties will require more than one No Trespassing sign."

      "content": "Buy No Trespassing signs made of durable, weatherproof material. You can purchase basic No Trespassing signs at your local hardware store. These signs will probably already meet your area's requirements for size and wording, but you may want to double check. Choose a durable, weather-proof material like aluminum or rigid plastic so your signage will remain legible over time.

      "content": "Order customized signs if you want specific wording. You may want to include additional or specific information on your signs, like \"Trespassing and Loitering Forbidden by Law,\" \"No Skateboarding,\" or \"Violators Will be Prosecuted.\" If you want customized signs, try ordering them online or from a local printing shop.

      "title": "Post your No Trespassing signs in visible places.",
      "content": "Post your No Trespassing signs in visible places. Good places for posting signs are on trees, gated entries, and along fences that surround your property's perimeter. Your signs will be most effective if they are clearly visible from many angles and directions. Starting at your first sign location, search for the most visible angle to post your sign, which is usually facing entryways or roads. [3] X Research source To effectively deter people from entering private property, post No Trespassing signs at eye-level or slightly higher for the best visibility. Make sure sign visibility isn't limited by nearby trees or building. It is not recommended to post any signs on utility poles, as this can endanger the lives of utility workers."

      "content": "Hang the sign securely on your chosen surface. Remember that your sign will be out in the elements and exposed to wind, rain, and more. Attach your sign to the surface by using a hammer and nails or strong wire. Jiggle the sign to make sure it's securely attached and wonâ€™t blow away or be ruined by moisture."

      "content": "Check on the condition of your signs every few months. Weathered or illegible signs usually have to be replaced within a specific time frame, so consider checking on yours periodically after posting them. Make sure all of your signs are intact, legible, and visible. Replace damaged or illegible signs as quickly as possible."

      "content": "Avoid confronting trespassers on your own. You may feel the urge to confront trespassers on your property or even try to make a citizen's arrest, but this is very dangerous and can escalate in unexpected ways. Instead, call the police and let trained professionals handle the situation for you. [4] X Research source It's always best to report trespassers to the police before taking action yourself."

If you witnessed someone trespassing on your property but they've already left the premises, you may still want to report them to the police so they can be arrested. Jot down everything you remember about them -- gender, height, weight, hair color, and any other significant details. This will help the police locate the right person or persons."

      "title": "Report the trespassers to your local law enforcement as soon as possible.",
      "content": "Report the trespassers to your local law enforcement as soon as possible. Give the police your descriptions and let them know the date and time the trespass occurred. If the trespassers are still on your property when you make the call, let the police know that so they can show up to the scene. Depending on what they were doing, you may want the police to simply kick them off your property or make an arrest. Be sure to report any damage or stolen property immediately. This is especially important if you plan to prosecute the trespassers."
