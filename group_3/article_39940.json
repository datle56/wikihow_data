      "content": "\"Smishing\" is an SMS or text message scam that steals users' data. In a smishing scam, the victim receives a text message from someone posing as an organization they trust, like their bank. The message encourages the victim to click a link or share sensitive information, like their credit card number. Clicking the link might install malware (malicious software) on the victim's device that steals their data. [1] X Trustworthy Source Federal Trade Commission Website with up-to-date information for consumers from the Federal Trade Commisson Go to source The term \"smishing\" combines 2 other terms: SMS (which stands for \"short message service\" and refers to text messaging) and phishing. Phishing is a scam that works the same as smishing, but it uses emails instead of texts. Below is a list of sensitive information smishing scams often ask victims to send them : Date of birth Social security number Home address Credit or debit card information (including PINs) Bank account information (including your bank account number, routing number, and answers to your security questions) Account numbers and usernames Passwords and PINs that grant access to your mobile device, computer, email address, and other accounts"

      "content": "Smishing scammers use social engineering to prey on victims. Social engineering is a way of manipulating people to do what you want by using psychological tricks. [2] X Research source Smishing text messages are carefully designed to make victims feel compelled to respond to them or click on the malicious links they contain. They do so by posing as trustworthy organizations or people, providing a reasonable context (like tracking a package or verifying bank fraud), and triggering people's emotions. For example, someone receives a text message telling them a suspicious transaction is pending on their credit card. The message tells them to click a link to investigate the transaction and cancel it if it isn't theirs. The victim decides to click on the link it contains because: They trust that the text is from the bank. They think a suspicious transaction is a good reason for the bank to contact them. They're afraid that the transaction will process through their account and they want to stop it."

By clicking the link, they might accidentally download a virus onto their phone. It may also take them to a fake webpage where they're prompted to type in their bank account or credit card number. Your bank or credit card company will never ask for your account number or credit card number to verify your identity. They already have that information, your date of birth, social security number, and other identification details. Example Text Message : \"CHASE BANK - Did you authorize a transaction for $1,907.78?

In this type of SMS scam, the text message may ask the victim to tap a link to track a package en route to their doorstep. It may also tell them there's a problem with their package and instruct them to click the link to see the reason for the delay. [5] X Research source Both these texts are huge red flags, and you should always investigate the claims thoroughly before clicking on any links they contain. Reputable shipping carriers like UPS and FedEx never send text messages to customers without their permission. If you didn't give them permission, the sender's number is more than 5 digits long, or you didn't order anything shipped by that carrier recently, the text is likely a scam. USPS never sends links in their tracking update texts. If you ever receive a text from them with a link in it, block the number right away, and don't click the link!

The text encourages the victim to tap a link to renew the service. Then they either install malware or lure the victim to give up their credit card information with a fake website. If you receive a service cancellation text from a company you recognize, always reach out to them directly through their customer service line or log into your account in a web browser first.
