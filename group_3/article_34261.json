Feeling as though you have no control over your life is stressful, so try to acknowledge what you cannot change and focus on what you can change instead. Doing so should help you feel more in control and make it easier to cope with your stress. [2] X Research source Try asking yourself a few of these questions: Is this situation avoidable? Which parts of this situation can I control? Is there a part of the situation that I need to accept for now because I cannot control it? What is my plan for controlling the aspects of the situation that I can control? Try to look at the big picture and ask yourself if this situation will matter in a year or five years? Will this one situation determine other things in your life? How important is controlling this one situation?"

Try journaling about how stress is affecting your emotions. Journaling has many health benefits including promoting mental well-being, improving self-esteem, and decreasing stress. [3] X Trustworthy Source University of Rochester Medical Center Leading academic medical center in the U.S. focused on clinical care and research Go to source Write about what you have been bottling up throughout the day and use your journal as a way to release that emotional tension. Talk to someone you trust who will listen to you and be supportive. Social support is important because it can help you feel loved and cared for, which helps relieve stress. Reader Poll: We asked 417 wikiHow readers who journal what practice helps them get the most out of tracking their thoughts and feelings, and only 10% of them agreed that the best way is to record evidence for or against their beliefs about themselves.

Saying ‘yes’ without realizing our limits or without setting boundaries can wreak havoc in our lives. It can also ruin our productivity by making it harder to focus on our primary tasks, activities, and responsibilities. Learning how to say \"no\" is the first step towards saving yourself, your productivity and your sanity. [5] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Remember, saying no is not selfish. It just means that you care enough about your well-being to maintain a healthy boundary for yourself. Saying no also means that you care about others and want to ensure that you will have the energy and mental capacity for your other obligations. Keep your answers direct and simple. You do not have to offer excuses, but a simple, “No – I’m sorry, I have too many commitments this week. I’ll have to take a rain check,” will do."

Both forms of carbohydrates boost the levels of serotonin (a brain calming and mood enhancing hormone) but with complex carbs (whole grain bread, cereals) the process is gradual and consistent because they are digested slowly.
