      "content": "Trust your instincts. If something feels “off,” trust your gut: It probably is. Many times people ignore their gut instincts out of politeness or not wanting to hurt someone’s feelings. You are always allowed to leave a situation without explanation, but especially when you feel threatened. While this may be more difficult in situations where you know the person who is making you uncomfortable (and in some instances, may even be related to them), keep in mind that most sexual assault victims know their perpetrator. Three out of four rapes were committed by someone known to the victim, while 93% of juvenile sexual abuse victims knew their abuser.

If you are still feeling compelled to stay in an uncomfortable situation, you could think to yourself: They started it! The person who is making you feel uncomfortable clearly doesn’t care about your feelings, so why should you care about theirs?"

Make sure that you know the strength of your alcoholic drinks, your tolerance level, and that no one is spiking them with additional alcohol. Be very wary of others buying you drinks. You could accept the drink and not drink it or put it down somewhere and “forget” it. Hold onto your drink and cover it with the top of your hand. Watch the bartender or party host make your drink or open your drink in front of you, even if it’s just a bottle of water.

You could approach a person or group of people and say loudly, “Oh, there you are! I’ve been looking all over for you!” Once out of earshot, explain the situation and ask if they can help you. If there is no one else around and you can’t enter a building safely, try making, or pretending to make, a call on your cell phone. You could say, “When are you coming to pick me up, Dad?

Many people are meeting others through the internet today, either through dating websites or friend groups, and most of the time, these get-togethers go off without a hitch. However, you still need to proceed cautiously the first time you meet someone you met on the internet. A person can easily misrepresent who they are online. Meet the person in a public place, like a busy coffee shop, for the first time. Tell a friend your plans, and have them call or text you while you’re there to check in. Come up with a code word to use if things are not going well, and the friend can help you leave the situation easily. If you need to travel in order to meet this person, do not tell the person where you are staying. Stay at a hotel or a friend’s house, not with them. Utilize your own transportation during the trip."

For example, say you are on a first date. Your date keeps insisting you get the bill and head back to their place. You are not interested and want to leave. You could say, “I can’t. I promised my roommate I’d let her dog out tonight.” If your date keeps pressing you, just say, “No, I’m sorry,” and leave as soon as you can."
