If you have an iPhone, you can use the iPhone Notes app to scan without installing any extra apps. [1] X Research source But if you want more features (or you have an Android), you'll want to use the free Adobe Scan app , which can quickly scan two pages at once and make it easier to extract the text. It can be tricky to hold the book open while scanning with your phone, especially if you're planning to scan the entire book. Still, your phone's scanner is a great option if you don't want to purchase other equipment or pay for a scanning service."

      "title": "Flatbed scanners.",
      "content": "Flatbed scanners. This common, cost-effective scanner type is widely available in stores, as they make it easy for home users to scan photos, documents, and book pages. Most all-in-one printers have flatbed scanners built-in, so you might already have one in your home. Scanning a book with a flatbed scanner will be more time-consuming than other options, as you'll need to lift the book from the scanner to turn the pages and then initiate the scan with your computer. While there's a slight risk that you'll damage the binding by pressing the book onto the scanner bed, flatbed scanners are generally a safe, non-destructive method of scanning a book."

      "title": "Consumer book scanners.",
      "content": "Consumer book scanners. There are many home book scanners on the market, most of which scan two pages at a time using an overhead camera. Other book scanners are simple wands that you can hover over each page to scan, similar to using your smartphone's camera. Libraries and college campuses often have book scanners on-site, which means you might be able to use one of these convenient scanners for free. Book scanners can really speed up the process of scanning the book, as you'll just need to flip the page between scans. Because you won't have to lay the book flat on a flatbed scanner, there's less risk of damaging the spine than when using a flatbed scanner, which is great if you're borrowing or renting the book you want to scan."

If you don't care about the condition of the book after the scan, you can remove the binding and cover and feed the separated pages into the automatic document feeder of an office-style printer/copying machine. When scanning an entire book, a sheet-feed scanner can be nice because it'll scan both sides of each page automatically without the need for a human to flip the page. However, the damage you'll do to the book might outweigh the benefits. Automatic sheet-feed scanners might reduce the quality of the scans, so it's best to use them for text-heavy books without many images."

All you'll have to do is hold your phone over the book and turn the page when prompted. If you have an iPhone and don't want to install an app, you can use the Notes app instead.

Many scanners have an \"Auto\" mode that can switch between black-and-white and grayscale automatically as it senses different types of content on the page.

If possible, carve off the binding glue, along with a thin strip of paper, with a sharp knife first or industrial shears. Industrial shears are not essential, but if you decide to purchase one, choose the old style cutter because it can cut thin strips easily. When cutting with a rotary cutter, overlap the paper, on the cutting platform, or else the paper will sink into the groove and the ends will not cut thoroughly. Additionally, to minimize uneven cutting, when using a rotary blade cutter, reduce the amount of sheets you cut. With a rotary cutter, your margins will be narrower on one side (cropping can adjust the margin width). A good scissors and a photo editing program like Windows Live is all that you need to get the pages looking professional in the end."
