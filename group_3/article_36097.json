      "title": "Place ant bait near the plant to destroy the ant colony.",
      "content": "Place ant bait near the plant to destroy the ant colony. Ants are drawn to the bait, which contains slow-acting insecticides contained in attractive sugars, oils, and proteins. Worker ants bring the poisonous food back to the colony and pass the harmful item directly to the mouths of other worker ants, larvae, and queens. As the poisonous bait is passed from ant to ant or ant to larvae, the colony slowly dwindles. [1] X Research source Insert an ant bait stick directly into the infested potted plant. Alternatively, fill a reusable bait station with the insecticide of your choice, such as Borax . Set it near the base of the plant and refill it as needed. Before using ant baits, always read the label to ensure that it is safe to use around children and pets. Purchase baits that include one of the following active ingredients: hydramethylnon, fipronil, boric acid, or avermectin B. Do not bait traps with cyfluthrin or permethrin. These fast-attacking insecticides will kill the worker ant before it can reach the colony."

      "content": "Cover the topsoil with diatomaceous earth (DE). Diatomaceous earth is an organic, mineral-based insecticide that dries out insects that come into contact with it. [2] X Research source To apply DE safely , use a garden duster to distribute this chalk-like substance around the base and on the soil of the infested potted plant. [3] X Research source Within approximately 30 minutes of coming into contact with DE, the ants on the plant will die. This product is less effective when wet. Reapply this product after watering, rain, or heavy dew. Do not inhale this product, and use a mask when applying it. It’s non-toxic, but may irritate your throat or sinuses. Store the remaining product inside a sealed bag to limit your exposure to the product."

      "content": "Apply the insecticide permethrin to the soil. Mix liquid permethrin concentrate with water and spray it on the soil according to the package’s instructions. When ants eat or come into contact with permethrin, their nervous system is paralyzed and the pests die. Before applying permethrin to any potted plant, read the product instructions carefully. If administered improperly, this insecticide can cause harm to humans.

      "content": "Mix 1 US gal (3.8 L) of water with 1 cup (~0.24 L) of dish soap. If your potted plant is totally infested with tiny pests, flooding the soil with a water-soap solution will cause the ants to flee their nest. The ants that come into contact with the mild insecticide mixture will die or drown. To prepare the solution: [5] X Research source Fill a clean bucket with 1 US gal (3.8 L) of water. (If your potted plant is large, double or triple the amount of water). Stir in 1 cup (~0.24 L) of insecticidal soap , dish soap , or dish detergent per 1 US gal (3.8 L) of water."

Second, fill a small spray bottle with the solution—you will use this to spray any ants that might escape from the soil. Lastly, save the remaining solution in a measuring cup (or any other vessel) to pour through the infested plant's soil. [6] X Research source"
