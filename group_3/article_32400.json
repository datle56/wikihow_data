    {
      "title": "Start studying a couple of days or weeks in advance of the exam.",
      "content": "Start studying a couple of days or weeks in advance of the exam. You won't do well on a physics test if you cram all of the important information the night before. Make a point to learn, understand, and practice physics problems a couple of days or even weeks before the exam is scheduled so that you are fully prepared when test day comes. [1] X Research source Having a good grasp on the information that will be on the test will make you more confident when you take it."
    },
    {
      "title": "Review the topics that may be on the test.",
      "content": "Review the topics that may be on the test. You can determine what will be on the exam based on the topics you’ve covered in class and any quizzes or homework that you’ve had thus far. Take a look at the notes that you took in class and memorize and study equations and key concepts that will likely be used on the test. [2] X Research source For example, you may be asked to define Newton’s first Law of Motion. You can write, \"An object at rest stays at rest and an object in motion stays in motion unless acted upon by an unbalanced force.\" [3] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Read ahead in the book before your class.",
      "content": "Read ahead in the book before your class. Having the text in your mind before you go into physics class will make it easier to follow along with your teacher. Many physics concepts build from what you learned last. Determine the parts that you’re having trouble understanding and write down questions that you have for your teacher. [4] X Research source For example, if you've already learned how to determine velocity, there's a good chance you'll review how to calculate average acceleration. Knowing the text in advanced will help you absorb the material better."
    },
    {
      "title": "Solve new problems outside of class.",
      "content": "Solve new problems outside of class. Spend at least 2-3 hours studying and solving new equations outside of class for every 1 hour of class time. This repetition will help you comprehend concepts better and will prepare you to solve the questions on the exam. [5] X Research source If you want, you can set a time limit on your answers to replicate the conditions in the exam."
    },
    {
      "title": "Review and revise your homework.",
      "content": "Review and revise your homework. Scan through your homework and try to solve the questions that you struggled with or got incorrect. Many teachers will put equations on the exam that are similar to homework questions so review them all. [6] X Research source You should even review the questions you got correct so that you can reinforce what will be on the exam."
    },
    {
      "title": "Attend and pay attention during every class.",
      "content": "Attend and pay attention during every class. In physics, new concepts build off prior concepts so it’s important that you don’t miss class or procrastinate with learning because it’s easy to fall behind. If you can’t make it to class, make sure that you get the notes and read the corresponding chapter in your textbook. [7] X Research source If you can’t attend class because of a sickness or emergency, ask your teacher what you should study while you’re out."
    },
    {
      "title": "Memorize what important variables represent.",
      "content": "Memorize what important variables represent. Since physics utilizes variables in equations, it's important that you know what each variable stands for or you won't be able to answer the question. Some of the most common variables are \"A\" for area, \"V\" for volume, a lowercase \"v\" for velocity, and a lowercase \"m\" for mass. It's best to concentrate on the variables that you know may show up on the exam. Acceleration is represented by a lowercase \"a,\" while momentum is represented by a lowercase \"p.\" Other important variables may include \"F\" for force, \"T\" for torque, and \"I\" for current."

    {
      "title": "Study important formulas.",
      "content": "Study important formulas. Knowing the core principles of physics will give you a greater understanding of the questions on the test. Some of the most important formulas in physics include calculating things like force, mass, and torque. [8] X Research source Physics also includes concepts like Newton's Law of Motion, gravity, vibrations, and waves. For example, d/t = s, or total distance over time equals average speed, is the equation to determine the average speed that an object was moving over a certain distance. To find the average acceleration of an object, you'd calculate the velocity of the object over the time that it traveled, or a = v/t."

    {
      "title": "Pay attention to unit conversions.",
      "content": "Pay attention to unit conversions. Physics teachers and professors will commonly include variables with different units of measure to trip you up on the test. Make sure to always fully read the questions and their units so that you remember to convert them before you solve the equation or you will get the wrong answer. [9] X Expert Source Sean Alexander, MS Academic Tutor Expert Interview. 14 May 2020. For example, if the equation asks you to determine the distance a train has traveled, you can solve it by multiplying velocity by time. However, if the equation asks you how far the train has traveled in 5 minutes while moving at 100 mph, you'll need to convert 5 minutes to its equivalent in hours, or 5 minutes/60 minutes (1 hour) = .083 hours. Instead of the equation being 100 mph x 5 minutes, the equation will now be 100 mph x .083 hours = 8.3 miles."

      "title": "Draw diagrams to help understand key concepts.",
      "content": "Draw diagrams to help understand key concepts. Many physics questions that have to do with forces can be drawn in a diagram or graph. If you’re stumped by math or equations, try drawing diagrams to better understand concepts and questions. [10] X Research source For example, you can draw an object as a square and draw the forces on that object using arrows. This can help you determine things like velocity."

      "title": "Use flashcards to memorize words and equations.",
      "content": "Use flashcards to memorize words and equations. Write down the equation name on one side of the card and the written-out equation on the other side of the card. Have someone read the equation name aloud and try to recite the correct answer. [11] X Research source For example, you can write “velocity” on one side of the card and write the equation for velocity, or “v=s/t” on the other side of the card. You can write “Newton’s Second Law” on one side of the card and write the equation for it or, “∑F = ma,” on the other side of the card."

      "title": "Evaluate previous exams to see what you’re struggling with.",
      "content": "Evaluate previous exams to see what you’re struggling with. If you have previous quizzes or tests that your teacher graded, you should review them and concentrate on the questions or concepts you got incorrect. This will help you improve where you're weak and could improve your overall exam score. [12] X Research source This is especially useful for exams that test your cumulative knowledge, like midterms or finals."

      "title": "Get 7-8 hours of sleep the night before the test.",
      "content": "Get 7-8 hours of sleep the night before the test. Getting adequate sleep helps build memory and will help you parse physics questions easier. If you cram all night and get no rest, there’s a good chance you won’t retain the information you studied. [13] X Research source Even if your exam is midday, it’s better to wake up early and be mentally prepared in advance. Since physics requires complex critical thinking, it's best to take the test when you're awake and aware. Sticking to a regular sleeping schedule will help reinforce what you learn when you study."

      "title": "Eat a healthy breakfast the day of the exam.",
      "content": "Eat a healthy breakfast the day of the exam. Eating a breakfast high in slow-release carbohydrates like rolled porridge oats or whole grain bread can improve student performance during exams. You should also consume proteins like eggs, yogurt, or milk to keep you feeling fuller for longer. To give yourself an extra boost of energy, finish off your breakfast with fruits high in fiber, like apples, bananas, or pears. [14] X Research source Eating a healthy breakfast before the exam will help you retain information better."
