Since your tax return transcript doesn't include the line numbers for the data, you have to use the description to find the data you need. Look for words on the transcript that are the same, or similar to, the words on the blank return. For example, if you're looking for the amount you entered on Line 4, this amount is your adjusted gross income. On your transcript, it will be listed as \"adjusted gross income\" under \"adjustments to income.\" Your transcript may have two lines for the same description. The second line will end with the words \"per computer.\" This reflects adjustments made by the IRS to the amount you entered on your return. Use those numbers, since they reflect the IRS's records most accurately.
