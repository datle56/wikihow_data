Once you’ve started a new game, you can choose to play either with a Facebook friend, a random user, or the person sitting next to you. To go with this last option, you’ll have to physically pass your smartphone to the other player after each turn, so the game is only accessible from your phone. If you download Words with Friends 2, you will also have the option of playing against a computer opponent. Words with Friends will suggest friends for you to play with, but you can start a game with anyone if you’d rather play a random opponent."

      "content": "Click and drag letter tiles to the board to play them and make words. You can create a word by placing your letters either vertically or horizontally on the board. However, you are not allowed to play the following types of words: proper nouns, abbreviations, prefixes and suffixes standing alone, or words that require a hyphen or an apostrophe. With the exception of the first word, every word that you play must be placed so that at least 1 letter tile is shared with a word that has already been placed on the board. Note that you can’t play a word if it will create an illegal word using neighboring letters. For instance, you can’t play the word “CAT” if the “T” tile is placed next to another “T” tile, since “TT” is not a legal word. When you play a letter, you earn a number of points equal to the number in the top right corner of the letter tile. Thus, when you play a word, you earn the sum total of all the letters you played to make that word."

      "content": "Play a word with at least 1 letter on the middle tile to start the game. Whoever plays the first word in a round of Words with Friends has to place at least 1 of the letters in that word on the star tile in the middle of the board. Note that it can be any letter in the word; in other words, your word doesn’t necessarily have to begin from the star tile. For example, if your first word is “CAT,” you can place either the “C,” “A,” or “T” tile on the star."

      "content": "Build new words off of the letters on the board when it’s your turn. If you played the first word, then your opponent will place a word on the board that connects to your word. When it’s your turn, place a word down that connects to either the first word you played or to the new word that your opponent played. Note that before you begin your turn, you will be given new letter tiles so that you have 7 on your rack."

      "content": "Go back and forth between the 2 of you until the game is over. A game of Words with Friends ends when 1 player has played all of their letter tiles and there are no more new letter tiles to be given. At that point, each player’s score is tallied and the player with the highest score wins. Note that if either player has leftover tiles at the end of the game, that player will lose points equal to the sum of the value of those leftover tiles."

      "title": "Place your letters in ways that limit your opponent’s ability to score.",
      "content": "Place your letters in ways that limit your opponent’s ability to score. Winning at Words with Friends is not only about scoring points for yourself, but also playing defense and preventing your opponent from scoring. When you play your letters, try to position the tiles so that your opponent doesn’t have access to the lucrative colored tiles on the board. To do this, avoid playing words next to double- or triple-word tiles. Although this may mean you have to play a word for a lower score somewhere else, it also keeps your opponent from being able to play these high-value tiles."

      "title": "Memorize different 2-letter words you can play across other words.",
      "content": "Memorize different 2-letter words you can play across other words. Playing 2-letter words, especially with valuable letters, enables you to essentially rack up points by only playing in 2- or 4-tile squares. This is not only more efficient for you, but also makes it harder for your opponent to play off of your words. [3] X Research source Some examples of 2-letter words you might be able to play include “XI,” “EX,” and “PI.”"

      "content": "Look for opportunities to play your letters on the colored squares. You earn extra points by placing your letters strategically on the colored tiles of the board. These tiles will earn you double or triple points, either for the letter that is played on that tile, or for the entire word that you played. Double- and triple-word squares are usually the most valuable colored tiles on the board. If you have a high-value letter tile, like “X” or “Z,” playing this tile on a double- or triple-letter tile is also a good way to rack up extra points."

      "content": "Try to play all 7 of your letters at once whenever possible. This is called a “Bingo” and it allows you get all the points in your 7 letters, plus a 35-point bonus. Memorize some common 7-letter words or simply play a lot of Words with Friends until you get better at spotting Bingo opportunities."

      "title": "Play your letters along words that are on the board to get more points.",
      "content": "Play your letters along words that are on the board to get more points. For example, if you have the letters to spell “POWER” and the word “AROSE” is already on the board, don’t play your letters vertically to use the “R” in “AROSE.” Instead, play your letters along the top of “AROSE,” so that you also spell “PA,” “OR,” “WO,” “ES,” and “RE.” When you play words along other words, you tend to get a lot more points. Note, however, that this only works if you’re able to spell legal 2-letter words with the letters that you play."
