      "title": "Create a list of do’s, don'ts, and rules for your relationship.",
      "content": "Create a list of do’s, don'ts, and rules for your relationship. Have a conversation with your partner (or partners, plural) to discuss what you want, what you’re comfortable with, and what’s allowed vs. not allowed. Set clear emotional and physical limits for your relationships and make sure you’re in agreement before moving forward. [1] X Research source For emotional boundaries, you could ask: Is it okay to become romantically involved with other partners? For physical boundaries: Are specific sex acts off the table? If you live with a primary partner, are you allowed to bring other partners home? Above all, make sure you have their explicit permission to date other people. This includes permission to engage in sex, pursue romantic connections, or date specific people within your social circle."

      "title": "Talk openly about your feelings and needs.",
      "content": "Talk openly about your feelings and needs. If your partner makes you feel happy and appreciated, let them know it. If you’re upset with your partner, bring up your concerns with them. Discuss your boundaries frequently, especially if your boundaries are changing as you have new experiences. [2] X Research source Practice active listening when you talk to your partner. It’s important to be receptive to their feelings and needs too. Consider seeing a relationship counselor or couple’s therapist who specializes in polyamory and ethical nonmonogamy. They can help you navigate the challenges of polyamory such as practicing good communication.

      "title": "Set a specific time to chat about your relationship.",
      "content": "Set a specific time to chat about your relationship . For example, if you have a primary partner, you can schedule a weekly “check in” to discuss how you’re both feeling or address any concerns that came up during the previous week. Polycules and throuples can also schedule meetings to catch up and make sure everyone is on the same page. [3] X Research source Planning is extremely important for polyamorous relationships since multiple people’s schedules have to be taken into account. Use an app like Google Calendar to help everyone agree on dates and times."

      "title": "Remember that your partner will have their own relationships.",
      "content": "Remember that your partner will have their own relationships. It’s normal to express interest in your partner’s relationships, but passing judgment, keeping tabs, or meddling in those relationships can be controlling and unfair. Show your partner’s partners the same respect you’d want your own partners to receive. [4] X Research source Depending on the kind of polyamory you practice, you may—or may not—know your partner’s partners personally. Your partner’s partners will want to spend time with your partner, just like you will. You’ll have to accommodate them to some degree. For example, give them the space and freedom to chat about their relationships on their own terms, rather than asking your partner for information about them."

      "title": "Use condoms and barrier protection to prevent the spread of STIs.",
      "content": "Use condoms and barrier protection to prevent the spread of STIs. Get tested regularly and ask your partners to do the same. Share your results with your partners prior to having sex. If necessary, you can use barrier contraception and hormonal birth control to help prevent unwanted pregnancy. [5] X Trustworthy Source MedlinePlus Collection of medical information sourced from the US National Library of Medicine Go to source Certain sexual practices, like anal sex, pose a higher risk for STI transmission. Use condoms to reduce the risk. PrEP , short for “pre-exposure prophylaxis,” is highly effective in preventing the transmission of HIV and is available to people regardless of their HIV status. Ask your doctor or visit a local health clinic for a prescription. [6] X Trustworthy Source Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Main public health institute for the US, run by the Dept. of Health and Human Services Go to source While condoms, hormonal birth control, and certain medications are highly effective at preventing STI transmission and unwanted pregnancy, accidents can still happen. Abstaining from sexual activity is the only method that is 100% effective in preventing pregnancy and STIs."

      "title": "Your partner’s needs and feelings won’t always align with yours.",
      "content": "Your partner’s needs and feelings won’t always align with yours. Your sex drives, levels of attraction, and interest in commitment might differ or change over time. Your partners will also have jobs, families, and other priorities—not to mention, partners of their own—so you may not be able to see them as often as you would if you were in a monogamous relationship. [7] X Research source For instance, your partner may be really focused about advancing in their career, while relationships take a higher priority in your life. As always, communication is key to managing expectations. Talk with your partners to make sure you’re on the same page."

      "title": "You can choose to share more of yourself with certain partners.",
      "content": "You can choose to share more of yourself with certain partners. For example, you might introduce some partners to your primary partner (if you have one). Or you might express romantic love to only one person—or only to specific people—but not others. [8] X Research source For example, you might create an \"intimate network\" for yourself by establishing a primary relationship, secondary relationship, and tertiary relationship. Make sure to be upfront with your partners about your emotional needs and expectations. For instance, if you’re not looking for romantic connections, be honest about that. Likewise, be aware of your partner’s needs and expectations. Make sure you’re in agreement before pursuing or maintaining a relationship."

      "title": "Give your partners the freedom to connect with their own partners.",
      "content": "Give your partners the freedom to connect with their own partners. Meddling in their relationships, calling or texting them during their dates, or disapproving of their partners for reasons other than abuse or problematic behavior, is controlling and disrespectful. Instead, practice compersion—that is, taking pride in your partner’s pleasure and joy. Trust their judgment and character, just as you’d want them to do for you. [9] X Research source For instance, if your partner starts connecting with a new person, give them the space and freedom to explore this new connection without any interference. Polyamory requires trust and maturity from you and everyone you date. For the best experience, be sure to choose partners who have earned your trust and respect."

      "title": "Breaking up isn’t easy, especially if you’re polyamorous.",
      "content": "Breaking up isn’t easy, especially if you’re polyamorous. But ending an unhappy relationship is important for your wellbeing. Polyamorous relationships can end for the same reasons monogamous relationships do: incompatibility, lack of communication, having different needs, jealousy, lack of attraction, or just being unhappy. [10] X Trustworthy Source Greater Good Magazine Journal published by UC Berkeley's Greater Good Science Center, which uses scientific research to promote happier living Go to source Being polyamorous can complicate breakups, especially if other partners are involved. Talk to your other partners about your situation to see if they can help you navigate a breakup. Breaking up does not have to mean cutting off all contact with someone. In many cases, polyamorous people remain friends after breakups—but this is a matter of choice."

      "content": "Do your best to understand your needs, desires, and feelings. As you explore your sexuality , you might come to realize that your gender or sexual identity isn’t what you thought it was. Your feelings about partners and certain sexual practices might change. You could even decide that polyamory isn’t for you. All of this is totally okay. [11] X Trustworthy Source Greater Good Magazine Journal published by UC Berkeley's Greater Good Science Center, which uses scientific research to promote happier living Go to source As you gain more experience, you’ll come to recognize what you like and don’t like. For instance, you might realize that you're looking for a more committed style of poly relationship, or that you're okay with adding more partners to your existing relationship. You and your partners will have a better experience if you’re truthful about your preferences and needs."
