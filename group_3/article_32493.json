      "content": "Measure the amount of space dedicated for pebbles. Carefully plan out your pebbled space. This area should be blocked off from the rest of the garden to heighten the effect of the pebbles. [3] X Research source Use a tape measure to get the exact measurements you need to pebble your garden. This will help you know exactly how many pounds of pebbles you need. In general, one ton of pebbles will cover about 100 square feet at 3/4 to 1 inch thickness. It may be useful to have extra pebbles around when you need to fill in your pebble garden, so make sure to have more than you need for the space you have."

Wear gloves and protective gear so you don't cut your hands or injure your eyes. Tear out weeds, flowers, or any other plants in the space that will be pebbled. Make sure that you remove the roots of these plants to prevent them from growing underneath your pebbles. Have gloves and protective goggles when tearing out weeds or flowers. This is especially important if you are using a weed wacker or electric hedge trimmers."

      "content": "Ensure adequate drainage in the garden. Precipitation can build up in the pebble garden if you do not have good drainage in your garden. [4] X Research source If water is building up when it rains, you may have a drainage problem. You can create a French drain, which is a trench next to the garden filled with gravel. This may help to keep your garden free from overflow water. Another option to improve drainage is burying a pipe underneath a trench. The pipe should send the run off water to an area that won't be flooded when it's raining. [5] X Research source"

This should be placed over the dirt or other base material that will be covered with pebbles. The weed mat covers the cleared area for the pebble garden and makes sure little will grow underneath the weed mat. [7] X Research source The base covering that will be covered by the weed mat can be soil, sand, grass, pavement or other natural material. The weed mat will limit the growth of weeds coming up through the pebbles. It will also keep the soil or other base material from mixing with the pebbles. Weed mats can be purchased in a garden or landscaping store. They are made from a variety of materials including plastic. Get a weed mat that's safe for the environment and will only affect the area you want it to for your pebble garden. A biodegradable weed mat will guarantee your weed mat only affects your garden area and will decompose after you're finished using it in your pebble garden."

[10] X Research source If a less natural, and more polished look is desired in the garden, use monochrome stones in onyx or white for a brighter, refined appearance. These are available at landscaping stores and are more uniform in size and shape. You can also make a pebble mosaic, where you combine a variety of different pebbles into one pattern. This can create a fun and interesting look for your garden. [11] X Research source Some other pebble design options include blurring the boundaries of your pebble garden with plants, combining different sized stones, and adding a rock border.

Make sure you have a good way to transport the pebbles from the store or environment, as well as some help when carrying them to your pebble garden. If you are gathering the pebbles from the natural environment, like riverbeds and streams, use a wheelbarrow to get the pebbles to the place where they will be laid. If you are buying them from a store, have someone help you transport them. Many bags of pebbles can be tiring to carry alone."

You should transport your bags of pebbles to the garden spot first, so you know how many bags you will need for the task. Place the bags next to the spot where they will go, so you have a good idea of how many bags you will need. Open the bags and fill out the pebble path with loose pebbles. Cut the pebble bags and shake them out onto the garden path. If you are creating pebble mosaic, you'll likely want to be cautious when moving the pebbles onto the garden space at first."

You can probably eyeball the level, but try to get down to the ground level to check it out. Be careful not to damage any plants or flowers in pebble gardens. They should still be able to get plenty of water and sunlight as well. Level out the pebbles as much as possible. You can try to eyeball it, but it may also be useful to use a gardening tool to smooth them out, even around plants and flowers."

      "content": "Cement the pebbles if necessary. Depending on your pebble pattern, it may be necessary to cement the pebbles down. In areas where people will be walking over the pebbles often, you may want to use cement to guarantee they don't become dislodged from the path. [14] X Research source Mix a 4:1 ratio from cement to sand when you're preparing the cement mixture. Ideally, the texture should resemble breadcrumbs. Pour the cement onto the path. Fill in pebbles into the path way. Don't use too much cement, since this will overwhelm your pebble path. Ideally, try to calculate the amount of cement needed and the amount of pebbles needed. In general, one 80 pound bag of cement will fill in a 4-inch thick slab of 2 square feet."
