Sometimes “hayya” is interpreted as “rush,” so this line may also be understood as “Rush to success.” Typically, only the person calling the Iqama recites these words.

While it's not required that you recite the Iqama to yourself, it's helpful for deepening your faith and building good religious habits. Include it in your private prayers if you prefer. [14] X Research source If someone else is praying with you, it's best to recite the Iqama, even if it's just 1 other person. In that case, the most knowledgeable follower should lead the prayer.

The words used in the Athan and the Iqama are almost the same, with a few exceptions: [18] X Research source Certain lines are repeated more or less often in each call to prayer. (For instance, \"Allahu Akbar\" is recited four times in the Athan and twice in the Iqama, while \"Ashhadu an la ilaha illallah\" is recited twice in the Athan and once in the Iqama.)
