      "content": "Lay the canopy flat on the ground. The canopy is the main part of the parachute and is attached to the backpack by a series of lines. Place the backpack on the ground so it’s facing up. Stretch out the lines and lay the canopy as flat as you can on the ground. [1] X Research source There may be some air or puffiness in the canopy, but that’s fine right now."

      "content": "Gather the brake lines where they connect to the back straps. Locate the brake lines, which are the long strings that connect the canopy to the straps of the backpack. Use your fingers to hold the lines so they’re separated and aren’t tangled up together. [2] X Research source For instance, you can lay 1 line over your index finger and another over your middle finger. Keeping the lines separated makes it easier to remove any twists and tangles."

      "content": "Hold the lines and walk toward the canopy to remove twists. Pick up the lines, keeping them gathered in your hands with the lines separated. Slowly walk toward the canopy to untangle and untwist the lines so they’re straight. Take your time and pause if you need to spend some extra time untwisting the lines."

Pull it back to you so you can see the lines connected to the canopy. Run your hands through the lines to untangle and untwist them. [3] X Research source The slider helps control the way air flows through the chute when it opens."

Starting at 1 side, use your hands to separate and count each of the cells. [5] X Research source It’s common for the cells to tangle or fold into the canopy, so it’s important that you count and separate them. Most parachutes have 9 total cells, but some have 7."

      "content": "Hold 1 side of the canopy and shake out the fabric. Grip either the left or the right side of the canopy so it’s collected together and won’t unfurl. Shake the fabric back and forth to loosen it up and make it easier to flake and separate. [6] X Research source Shaking helps to separate the fabric of the canopy."

Flaking is the process of separating each of the panels or cells of the parachute so the canopy opens up correctly. [7] X Research source Keeping the lines over your shoulder, slide your hand down into the space between the lines and fluff and flake the fabric so it’s separated and untangled. Then, move to the cell next to it and flake it as well. Work your way around the entire canopy, fluffing and flaking the material. Flaking helps to remove any folds that could affect how the parachute opens."

With the lines still over your shoulder, pull the slider down the lines and push it into the canopy as far as it will go. Then, spread it out evenly so it fits in the space between the lines.
