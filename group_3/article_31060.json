      "title": "Rings around the moon are caused by light passing through ice crystals.",
      "content": "Rings around the moon are caused by light passing through ice crystals. Also called “lunar halos,” this natural phenomenon happens when the moon’s light travels through cirrus or cirrostratus clouds. The unique shape of the ice crystals in the clouds focuses the light into a ring, creating that dazzling halo effect. The ice crystals also sometimes separate the wavelengths of light, forming a rainbow of colors around the moon. [1] X Research source Sometimes, lunar halos are accompanied by 2 bright spots of light at opposite ends of the halo, which are also caused by the ice crystals. These are called “moon dogs,” and can also occur around the sun when ice crystals are present in the air during the day, at which point they’re called “sun dogs.” While lunar halos aren’t especially rare, they occur most often in colder climates and do require some particular conditions in order to appear. Typically, the air needs to cold enough to form ice crystals, and the clouds that refract the light must sit at an altitude of 20,000–40,000 feet (6,100–12,200 m). They’re also more common during full or almost-full moons."

      "content": "Lunar halos often predict bad weather or rain in folklore. Legend has it that when you see rings around the moon, the weather will take a turn for the worse within the next day or so. [2] X Research source And that’s actually backed by science! The cirrus clouds that cause the effect often indicate an oncoming warm front during cool seasons, which tends to bring low-pressure systems of rain, hail, snow, or thunderstorms. [3] X Research source This belief is common in many Native teachings, like those of the Nakoda people in Canada and the people of the Torres Strait. [4] X Research source Some believe that counting the number of stars inside the halo can tell you how many days until the wet weather arrives, but that’s a belief that can’t be proven with science."

      "content": "Moon rings are sometimes associated with the Inuit moon god. This mythical figure, Anningan, is said to be the sibling of the sun god, Malina. According to Inuit beliefs, Anningan chases Malina across the sky, and sometimes catches her during the solar eclipse. [5] X Research source Some believe that when rings form around the moon, it means a man has died or that a girl has been born, and Anningan is expressing his grief through the rings.

      "content": "The color of the halo might indicate different spiritual energies. Some believe that you can interpret various spiritual messages from the color of the halo. A white halo indicates pure energies or communication from a higher power, while a gold halo indicates generally positive energies. Blue halos might signify love or support from a higher power, while red halos might indicate inner frustration. Finally, a halo with black borders might indicate a loss of spirituality or adrift feelings. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Moon rings might be a sign of good luck or protection. Moon rings often portend rain or wet weather. [9] X Research source While some see that as an ominous sign, others, like farmers, often see it as a sign of good luck, welcoming the rain to help their crops grow. Some think that it means a higher power is watching over and protecting them, sending them gifts from above. The ring around the moon might also symbolize a shield that protects you from your worries or doubts."

      "content": "Moon rings serve as a reminder of the moon’s influence. The rings around the moon might be seen as a “target” or a circle that emphasizes the moon’s power, reminding you of the moon’s spiritual sway. Like the tides, many believe the moon influences our emotions, intuition, and spiritual states. [10] X Research source When you see a lunar halo, then, it might be a suggestion to examine your emotions or ask yourself if there are any feelings you’ve been burying. This might also be a reminder to me to be more conscious in your decision making, or even a sign that the universe is trying to send you a message, and you need to stop for a moment to receive it."

      "title": "Moon rings in your dreams may symbolize impending danger.",
      "content": "Moon rings in your dreams may symbolize impending danger. Just as moon rings symbolize coming storms in folklore, seeing a lunar halo in your dreams might suggest danger just around the corner. As in Native beliefs, it may suggest the death of a loved one. It might also be warning that you’re consumed with self-doubt, and need to bolster your confidence. Seeing moon rings in your dreams might also be a symbol of a coming transformation, like entering a new phase of your life. The circle around the moon also resembles an embrace, reminding you in your sleep that you’re loved."

      "title": "Moon jewelry might symbolize love or the divine feminine.",
      "content": "Moon jewelry might symbolize love or the divine feminine. The moon is often associated with the divine feminine, which is the feminine energy that lives inside everyone. [11] X Research source The divine feminine is associated with qualities like compassion, intuition, and nurturing. The moon is often characterized as a feminine celestial body, and so moon imagery on rings or necklaces might be a symbol of this divine feminine energy. In addition, some wear moon rings as engagement rings to symbolize their complementary nature to their partner, much like the divine feminine complements the masculine. These rings represent a deep love and lasting bond between the wearers."

      "title": "Moon jewelry might also represent tides of change or shifting emotion.",
      "content": "Moon jewelry might also represent tides of change or shifting emotion. Just like the moon pulls and shapes the tide, many believe that the moon also shapes our emotions. [12] X Research source Wearing moon jewelry can be a powerful reminder that we’re in tune with nature, and that if our emotions feel out of control, we might look to the moon as an explanation. Like the tides, our emotions are constantly waxing and waning, and a moon ring or necklace reminds you that the next shift is just around the corner, so it’s important to go with the flow. In addition, wearing a moon ring on your right hand is said to bring luck in changing times, while wearing it on your left hand might bring bad luck."

      "content": "Moonstones represent protection, love, and sleep. The moonstone is a milky, opaque stone that’s often used in jewelry of all sorts. It’s said that wearing the stone can grant someone increased fertility. It’s also said that wearing moonstone jewelry brings you spiritual protection or a sense of calm. Some wear a moonstone to bed, believing that the stone’s calming energies help lull them to sleep. [13] X Research source"

      "title": "Full moon jewelry is a reminder to enjoy your life.",
      "content": "Full moon jewelry is a reminder to enjoy your life. The full moon is quite the spectacle in the sky, and is likewise a time of intense spiritual energies. You might feel heightened emotions when you see it, or like you want to seize life by the reins. [14] X Research source Jewelry that features the full moon serves as a wearable reminder of this intense energy, telling you to take full advantage of your life, even when the moon isn’t full."

      "title": "Crescent moon jewelry represents spiritual growth, or endings.",
      "content": "Crescent moon jewelry represents spiritual growth, or endings. The crescent moon occurs when the moon is growing, or “waxing,” and again when the moon is fading, or “waning.” [15] X Research source A waxing crescent (with the crescent on the right side) is a symbol of spiritual growth and an open mind, and crescent moon jewelry serves as a reminder to be open to the world and what it brings you. Interpreting waxing moon phases often helps you orient your spiritual state. Likewise, a waning crescent (on the left side) represents closing doors or moving on, and jewelry with this moon reminds you to thank the world for your opportunities, but to let them go when the time comes."

      "title": "New moon jewelry is a reminder to pause and take stock of things.",
      "content": "New moon jewelry is a reminder to pause and take stock of things. The new moon, or when the moon is fully shadowed by the earth, is a time of suspension as we wait for the moon to reappear. During this time, we look inward to rest, journal, or decide our next step. [16] X Research source Wearing new moon jewelry helps you to take that careful and intentional energy throughout the rest of the month, not just during the dark new moon. New moon jewelry might also be worn as a sign of protection, wearing the new moon like a shield as you take the next steps in your life."
