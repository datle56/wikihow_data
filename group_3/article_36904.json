The drywall piece should be roughly the same size as your hole. Measure your drywall's thickness, and match your drywall patch to the thickness of your existing drywall. Purchase a single piece of drywall, or ask an employee if they have any drywall scrap pieces. They often have some leftovers from helping other customers."

You can use a 5 US gal (19 L) bucket to mix all of this together. Add your water 1 cup (240 mL) at a time to control your consistency. Purchase drywall compound from a home supply store. Any home supply store should have this ready and in stock. You can let your drywall sit overnight to allow lumps to dissolve, if you’d like. This will create a more uniform texture."

Cut out the drywall around the hole so you can patch it. Add backer boards about 4 inches (10 cm) longer than the size of the hole. Make sure your repair drywall is the same thickness as your original drywall, and cut it to the size of the hole. Place your drywall patch inside the same hole, and screw it into the backing boards and the wall. Your large hole is now patched! [8] X Research source Check for wires before you add your drywall! Use a ruler or measuring tape to size your hole. You can screw in your drywall with a drill or screwdriver. Place your screws about 6 inches (15 cm) apart from each other."

You can purchase wall primer from home supply stores in the paint aisle. If you didn’t use primer on your first drywall application, you don’t need to use it to repair your drywall."

Thinner consistencies allows the drywall mud to flow smoothly across the walls, whether you’re using hand tools or a sprayer. Add 1 cup (240 mL) of water to your mix until you’ve created a thin, liquidy batter. The amount you water down will depend on the effect you are trying to create, so some experimentation may be needed. Be careful not to add too much water to your mix. If your mixture is watered down too much, it will be difficult to spread across the walls. Aim for a thin mixture resembling runny pancake batter. [10] X Research source If your mix is too thick, apply another part of drywall mix to thicken it up."

Remember to dip your brush back into your drywall mixture as needed. For the skip trowel texture, angle your knife when you apply the drywall so the drywall will skill across the surface and leave behind a texture. For the Santa Fe texture, apply 2 smooth layers with a rounded knife. When you apply the top layer, let some of the bottom layer show through to create this texture. For a swirl texture, move your brush in circular motions, either clockwise or counter-clockwise. You should match your motions to the directions of the circles you created the first time. For the rosebud texture, apply 1 thin layer of drywall mix with your knife, and then take a soft bristled brush and stamp it onto your wall. The spread bristles will create flower-like patterns."

You can test this by spraying onto a scrap of wood, or a piece of cardboard. When you have achieved the look you want, make a note of what PSI and aperture you used. Lower pressure will not spray the drywall mixture evenly, and higher pressure will make it hard to control the amount sprayed. A large aperture will create large blobs, and a small aperture will create fine texture. You can adjust this based on the look you are created. For example, you may want a small aperture for creating the “orange peel” look."

This will apply more drywall at once to build up the texture. Then, use a drywall knife to “knock down” the drywall once it has set lightly. Add styrofoam to your drywall mud mixture to create a popcorn texture. Spray 1 thick, even layer using your spray hopper. [19] X Research source"
