      "content": "Use an acidic cleaner for best results. Because hard water stains are alkaline, it’s best to remove them with a powerful acid. Look for a cleaning product that contains either phosphoric, sulfuric, or hydrochloric acid, as these acids should be able to effectively break down the stains. Read the directions on the product’s label and apply the acid cleaner to the stained areas as instructed. [1] X Research source Acidic cleaning products are toxic, so be sure to take safety precautions when handling them, such as wearing eye protection and gloves, and don’t use them on surfaces that come in contact with food, such as kitchen countertops. Acidic cleaning products work well on enamel and acrylic surfaces but can damage many others, including natural marble, stone, terrazzo, anodized or polished aluminum, and colored grout. To prevent damage, test the product in an inconspicuous area before using it on the entire stained area. [2] X Research source"

[3] X Expert Source Raymond Chiu House Cleaning Professional Expert Interview. 8 May 2020. Mix some lemon juice into the vinegar to increase the effectiveness and add a fresh lemon scent. Lemon juice (another an acid) has the same effect on minerals as vinegar. Put your vinegar and lemon juice in a spray bottle and slightly warm them in the microwave, for 20-40 seconds depending on your microwave. A warmed cleaner can be more effective at lifting stains than cold or room temperature cleaner. Just be sure to remove the spray bottle top so that it doesn’t explode in the microwave. Spray the vinegar solution on the glass and let it stand for about 2-3 minutes before wiping it clean with a dry, lint-free cloth or a paper towel. To remove hard water stains from drinking glasses and other small glass items, fill a basin with a 50/50 solution of vinegar and water, and allow the items to soak in the solution for several hours before rinsing thoroughly."

Use “magic” and “eraser” cleaning pads or other non-scratching scrubbing sponges to safely scrub your glass surfaces.
