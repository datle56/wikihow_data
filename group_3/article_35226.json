      "content": "Find the \"hole\" column which lists the holes from 1 to 18. Typically, the first thing on a golf scorecard is the list of holes. Golf courses vary between 9-hole courses and 18-hole courses. Some scorecards will have a map of the course with each hole on the map having its number next to it. [1] X Research source Holes are typically played in order from 1 to 18. In some cases, like when the course is especially busy, players may start on the 10th and finish on the 9th hole. Players will start on the 10th hole and play from 10 to 18. After 18, players will then play from the 1st hole to the 9th hole to complete their round."

      "content": "Identify the front and back sections that split the course into 2 halves. Full-size, or 18-hole, courses are split into two 9s, or two 9-hold sections. Holes 1 to 9 are known as the front 9, and holes 10 to 18 are known as the back 9. After the 9th and 18th hole sections of the scorecard, you will see the words “Out” and “In” respectively. [2] X Research source The 9th hole marks the end of the \"Out\" section, which means playing away from the clubhouse. The 18th hole marks the end of the \"In\" section, which means playing back toward the clubhouse."

      "title": "Note the tee box colors on the side which indicate each hole’s distance.",
      "content": "Note the tee box colors on the side which indicate each hole’s distance. These colors represent the placement of the tee boxes on each hole. The numbers beside the color and beneath each hole denote the distance of that hole. Each color has a different meaning: [3] X Research source Black or gold tees are the farthest from the hole. These tees are usually only played by professionals or very high-standard amateurs. Most courses do not have black or gold tees. Blue tees reflect the tee boxes for local competitions. These tees are normally used by very good amateur players. If a course doesn’t have black or gold tees, the blue tee boxes are the farthest from the hole. White tees are the middle tees, mostly used by golfers with middle-to-high handicaps. Red tees are the shortest members’ tees. These tees are the closest to the fairway and make the course much shorter than the other tees. They are also known as “ladies’ tees.” Green tees are used by junior golfers or beginners."

      "title": "Locate the handicap section which ranks the holes by difficulty.",
      "content": "Locate the handicap section which ranks the holes by difficulty. Most golf scorecards also have a column that notes the handicap, or stroke index, or each hole. These numbers range from 1-18 and note the difficulty of each hole. Index 1 is the hardest hole on the course, and index 18 is the easiest. [4] X Research source Some cards also have a section for \"women's handicap.\" Some holes may play differently for women and men, which is why some courses have separate sections. The handicap of each hole rarely overlaps with a player's handicap . Match-play is one area of golf where both handicaps are relevant. In match-play, players play each other in 1 vs. 1 situations. If Player A has a handicap of 2 and Player B has a handicap of 7, the difference is 5. Player B will then be allowed an extra shot on the 5 hardest holes, or the 5 holes with the lowest index. If Player A gets a 4 on one of these 5 holes and Player B gets a 5, they tie because of Player B's handicap."

      "title": "Spot the par information to determine how many shots you should take.",
      "content": "Spot the par information to determine how many shots you should take. Par means the expected number of strokes on a hole. [5] X Research source For example, if par is 4, you should take 4 shots, and if par is 3, you should take 3 shots. Find the par information in the par row on the scorecard. The average golf course is a par 72, which means that the pars of all the holes added together equals 72. If you look at the \"Out\" and \"In\" columns on the scorecard, you will see the par for each set of 9 holes. A par 72 golf course will usually have two 9 holes that are both par 36. Par generally relates to length. Par 3s are the shortest holes on golf courses and par 5s are the longest holes. The most common par on a course is a par 4."

      "content": "Read the course and slope rating to gauge the golf course’s difficulty. The course rating represents the expected score for a golfer with a handicap of 0, while the slope rating reflects the relative difficulty of a course for players who do have a handicap. A slope rating of 113 is considered average, with higher values increasing in difficulty. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Read the rules of golf (optional). Some golf scorecards may also have a section that lists the general rules of golf and any special rules based on where you’re playing. [7] X Research source This section may also explain the pace of play ( how long it takes to play 9 or 18 holes) and list reminders about course etiquette. If you’re an experienced player, it may not be necessary to read the general rules, but it never hurts to have a refresher."

      "content": "Write down the initials of everyone in your group. Your scorecard will have spaces along the left side for every player’s name, though some cards may only provide enough room for an initial. In general, there will only be spaces for 4 names, as golf is typically played with no more than 4 total players. [8] X Research source If you’re the one keeping score , your name will usually go in the final slot. If you prefer an app instead of a physical scorecard, try keeping score with apps like mScorecard or EasyStroke ."

      "title": "Note the score each player gets on each hole.",
      "content": "Note the score each player gets on each hole. Write down the number of strokes each player took, not the number of shots they took versus par. For example, if you played the 1st hole, a par 4, and took 5 strokes, write a 5 in the box next to your name and below the 1st hole’s column. [9] X Research source When there’s a hole in 1, some players mark it by writing a “1” with a circle around it to draw attention to it. If you make a mistake, cross out the wrong number and write the correct score next to it. Sign your initials next to the corrected score to show that you were the one who corrected it and not somebody else trying to cheat. If you’re using the Stableford System , players earn points based on their scores in relation to par on each course. This is a good option for recreational players because there are no negative points. To mark Stableford on your card use two rows: the top for the number of strokes you took to complete the hole and the bottom for the Stableford points earned on that hole."

      "title": "Calculate everyone’s total at the end of the round.",
      "content": "Calculate everyone’s total at the end of the round. The easiest way to do this is by adding 9 holes at a time. Add your score for the first 9 holes and mark your total in the relevant box in the “Out” column. Then, do the same for the second 9 holes and mark your total in the “In” column. To find your total shots for the 18 holes, add the “In” and “Out” together. [10] X Research source For example, if the course is a par 72 and you took 80 shots, you were 8 over par. If the course is a par 70 and you took 65 shots, you were 5 under par."
    },
    {
      "title": "Mark each golfer’s score versus par in the total column.",
      "content": "Mark each golfer’s score versus par in the total column. Once you’ve calculated exactly how many shots each player took, find the difference between each player’s total and the par of the course. For example, if you took 77 shots on a par 72, you were 5 over par. Mark +5 in your section of the total column. If your friend finished 4 under par, mark -4 in their section of the total column. Even par, taking exactly the amount of shots you should, can be marked with a 0 or an “E.” Handicaps are a little more tricky. If you have a -15 handicap and you take 85 shots on a par 72, take 15 from 85. This leaves you with 70 shots on a par 72, or 2 under par. A player with a -3 handicap will take 3 from their total. If they take 72 shots on a par 72, they take 3 from 72 to give them 69, meaning they’ve shot 3 under par with their handicap. Your handicap is essentially an allowance to help you. Better players have lower handicaps and less-skilled players have higher handicaps."

If you fail to mark your card, you will be disqualified from the competition. If you marked the card, sign your name in the “marker” section. If someone else marked the card, write your name in the “scorer” section of the card.

Consider other factors such as weather conditions, as well. If it’s windy, for example, it may be better to play from a shorter tee."
