Simply use some pomade , gel , or wax to brush your hair forward into tousled or messy waves. [2] X Research source Why this style works : The longer hair on top adds volume and helps conceal any thinning areas along your hairline.

[3] X Research source For an even more dramatic look, opt for a bald fade. A bald fade trims your hair as close to your head as possible and can conceal your hairline better.
