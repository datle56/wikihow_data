Use an oil-based makeup remover to dissolve waterproof eyeliner â€” it might seem counterintuitive to use oil as a cleanser, but it works. [1] X Research source A dual-phase makeup remover removes most eye makeup. Cleansing water is perfect for sensitive skin or eyeliner that comes off easily, like liquid liner. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Saturate a flat, cotton pad with the product. A pad is preferable to a cotton ball, which can leave behind fibers that may get stuck in your eye.

Look for a wipe made specifically for use around your eyes Sensitive baby wipes can sometimes be used to cleanse your face, but they're not designed to lift off makeup. Try to stick to wipes that are specifically for makeup removal for the best results. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Use the edge of the wipe to wipe along the base of your eyelashes. Wipe along the upper lid with an outward motion (from the inner corner of your eye to the outer). Then repeat underneath your lower eyelid. Change to a new tip of the wipe for each eye, to prevent transferring anything from eye to eye. Don't pull or tug the skin too much. This can cause wrinkles. The edges of eyelids are usually neglected during makeup removal. This can be dangerous, as the eyeliner can build up over time and cause some irritation. [7] X Research source"

It should be a two-step process: remove your makeup first, then follow by washing your face. [8] X Research source"

Make sure you are using a trusted brand of highly refined petroleum jelly. It is a byproduct of oil refining and is found in different grades of purity. If it's not properly purified it can contain harmful toxins. [9] X Research source"
