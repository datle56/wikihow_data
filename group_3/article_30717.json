No calculations are necessary; however, if you're interested in how this works, you might need to know a little trigonometry. The method Using a Clinometer or Transit goes into the full calculations and reasons why this work, but you don't need to go into it to find the height using this method."

Fold one corner over so it forms a triangle with the opposite side, then cut off the extra paper above the triangle. You should be left with the triangle you need. [2] X Research source The triangle will have one right (90 degree) angle and two 45 degree angles."

One of the short sides should be horizontal (flat), and the other should be vertical (pointing straight up). You should be able to look up along the longest side by raising your eyes. [3] X Research source The longest side, the one you'll be looking along, is called the hypotenuse of the triangle."

Add your own height to this, since you were looking at the tree from the height of your eyes off the ground. Now you have the full answer! To learn how this works, see the \"Using a Clinometer or Transit\" section. You don't need to do any calculations in this method, because there's a little trick: the tangent of a 45º angle (which you used) equals 1. The equation can be simplified to this: (Height of tree) / (distance from tree) = 1. Multiple each side by (distance from tree) and you get: Height of tree = distance from tree."

[5] X Research source You'll need a single number, such as your height in inches, not a combination of feet and inches. If you're not sure how to convert into one number, you can use the height of a yardstick or meter ruler standing vertical instead (3 feet or 1 meter). Use the ruler's height and the length of the ruler's shadow anytime you are asked to use If you are in a wheelchair or cannot stand straight for another reason, measure your height in whatever position you'll be in when you go outside to measure the tree."

Or better yet, place the rock anywhere on the ground, and then position yourself so the tip of your shadow is at the rock; then measure from where you're standing to the rock.

This works best if the ground all along the shadow is fairly level; if the tree is on a slope, for example, your measurement won’t be as accurate. Do this immediately after you've measured your shadow, since the sun's movement will cause the shadow length to change. [7] X Research source If the tree's shadow is on a slope, there might be a different time of day when the shadow avoids the slope either by being shorter or by pointing in the other direction."

      "content": "Add 1/2 the tree's width to the length of the tree's shadow. Most trees grow straight upwards, so the highest tip of the tree should be above the exact middle of the tree. To get the total length of its shadow, you should add 1/2 the diameter of the tree trunk to your shadow measurement. This is because the highest tip is actually causing a longer shadow than you measured; some of it is just falling over the top of the tree trunk where you can't see it. Measure the width of the trunk with a long ruler or straight tape measure, then divide by 2 to get 1/2 the tree's width. If you're having trouble seeing how wide the trunk is, draw a tight square around the base of the trunk and measure one side of that square."

You should now have three numbers written down: your height, your shadow's length, and the length of the tree's shadow (including 1/2 its trunk width). Shadow lengths are proportional to the height of the object. In other words, (your shadow's length) divided by (your height) will always equal (the tree's shadow's length) divided by (the tree's height). We can use this equation to find out the tree's height: [8] X Research source Multiply the length of the tree’s shadow by your height. If you are 5 feet (1.5 meters) tall, and the tree's shadow is 100 feet (30.48 meters) long, multiple them together: 5 x 100 = 500 (or for the meter measurements, 1.5 x 30.48 = 45.72). Divide the answer by the length of your shadow. Using the example above, if your shadow is 8 feet (2.4 meters) long, divide your answer by that number. 500 / 8 = 62.5 feet (or in metric, 45.72 / 2.4 = 19.05 meters).

Since, depending on the height of the tree, you may need to be some distance away from your friend, consider using hand signals (with the hand that is not holding the pencil) to tell him or her to go farther, come closer, or move to the left or right.

You'll need to measure the length of each mark and the height of your friend, but you can do this after you go home, without having to return to the tree. Scale the difference in lengths on the pencil up to your friend's height. For instance, if the mark showing your friend's height is 2 inches (5 cm) from the tip and the mark for the tree's height is 7 inches (17.5 cm), then the tree is 3.5 times as tall as your friend, since 7 inches / 2 inches = 3.5 (17.5 cm / 5 cm = 3.5). If your friend is 6 feet (180 cm) tall, the tree is 6 x 3.5 = 21 feet tall (180 cm x 3.5 = 630 cm).

The other methods are surprisingly accurate, but with a little more math and specialized tools you can get a more accurate reading. It's not as daunting as it sounds: all you need is a calculator that can calculate tangents, and a cheap plastic protractor, straw, and piece of string so you can Make a Clinometer yourself. A clinometer measures the slope of objects, or in this case the angle between you and the top of the tree. A transit is a more complicated tool used for the same purpose, but uses a telescope or laser to achieve more accuracy. [15] X Research source The Piece of Paper method actually uses a piece of paper as a clinometer. This method, besides being more accurate, allows you to measure the height from any distance, instead of moving forward and backward to get the paper to line up with the tree."

Thus if the angle of elevation is 60 degrees, you simply push “TAN” and then enter “60” and then press the equal sign. [18] X Research source Click this link to go to an online tangent calculator. The tangent of an angle in a right triangle is defined by the side opposite the angle, divided by the side adjacent to the angle.
