      "content": "Not on all phones. iPhones in particular do not support exporting contacts to your SIM card. The Google Contacts app on Android also doesn't support this feature. This is due to the limited amount of storage space that a SIM card can hold. SIM cards can only hold between 250 to 500 contacts. [1] X Research source Also, many newer phones use an eSIM instead of a physical SIM card. Most newer devices prefer using cloud storage backups as a way to transfer data from one device to another instead of the SIM card. However, you can still transfer contacts to a SIM card using the Contacts app on Samsung Galaxy devices as well as using third-party apps on Android. [2] X Research source"
