      "content": "Get 1.5 yards (1.4 m) of fabric. Having a bit of stretch to your infinity scarf can be nice if you decide to wrap it around your neck a few times, so you may want to go with a stretch jersey fabric. This will make it easier to get the scarf on and off. However, you can also go with a non-stretchy fabric if you choose, such as a cotton broadcloth or satin. Select a fabric that will allow you to create the type and color scarf that you want to wear."

      "content": "Cut the fabric to the desired length and width. You can wrap the fabric around your neck to determine how long you want it to be, and doing this will also help you to decide how thick you would like you scarf. [1] X Research source [2] X Expert Source Mia Danilowicz Master Tailor Expert Interview. 8 January 2021. Mark the fabric where you want to cut it for the length, and then lay the fabric out flat and cut a straight line across the fabric to shorten the piece. If the fabric feels too bulky around your neck, then try cutting a few inches off of the long edge to thin it out. Then, try it on again. For a lightweight scarf, cut the fabric so that it is 24 inches (61 cm) wide and about 54 inches (140 cm) long. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Set your sewing machine. If you are using a stretchy fabric, then use the zigzag stitch setting on your sewing machine. This will help to provide some give to the stitched areas. If your fabric is not stretchy, then use the straight stitch setting on your sewing machine. [4] X Research source Every sewing machine is a little different. Consult your sewing machine’s manual for instructions on how to apply different settings to your machine."

      "content": "Fold the fabric in half lengthwise with the printed sides facing each other. Lay your fabric out flat on your work surface so that the printed side is facing up towards you. Then, fold one of the long edges over so that it matches up with the other long edge. [5] X Research source After you fold your fabric in half, the print sides should be matching up and no longer visible. You may pin the edges together to keep the fabric’s edges even while you sew. Place a pin about every 4 inches (10 cm) to hold the fabric edges in place. This is especially helpful if you are working with a slippery fabric. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Sew a few inches in and then backstitch a few stitches. Place your fabric under the presser foot so that the end of the fabric is lined up under the needle. Then, lower the presser foot and start stitching at a slow speed by applying gentle pressure to your pedal. Sew about 0.5 inches (1.3 cm) from the raw (cut) edges of the folded fabric. After you get a few stitches into the fabric, backstitch a few stitches. [7] X Research source To backstitch, press the lever on the side of your machine. This will reverse the direction of your stitches. When the needle gets to the end of your fabric again, release the lever."

Do not sew all the way around the tube! Leave about 3 inches (7.6 cm) unsecured. You will need this opening to turn the fabric right-side out.

Thread a needle with about 30 inches (76 cm) of a color of thread that matches your fabric. Match up the ends of the thread so that they are even, and tie a knot to secure the ends of the thread. Insert the needle from the inside of your fabric so that the knot will be anchored inside of the scarf. Then, begin sewing the hole closed. [14] X Research source Tuck the fabric edges under as you sew across the hole to ensure that the cut edges are hidden. Make sure to sew the two sides together evenly so that the hole will have a neat closure. Secure the thread with a knot when you are finished and cut the excess thread."

For example, you could use a rayon challis, cotton voile, silk gauze, or cotton batiste fabric to make your scarf. Make sure that the fabric looks the same on both sides. Otherwise, you will have a scarf with one side printed and the other not printed, which may look a bit odd. Most gauzy, semi-transparent fabrics will look the same on both sides"

You can use 1.5 yards (1.4 m) for a moderate length scarf, or use 2 yards (1.8 m) for a long scarf. The width of the fabric will depend on how full you want it to be. Try wrapping the fabric around your neck a couple of times to see how it looks with the current width. If it seems too full, then you could cut off some of the excess to lighten it up."
