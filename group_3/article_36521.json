      "content": "Make sure you’ve healed enough before removing your stitches. In some cases, you absolutely shouldn't remove your own stitches. If your stitches were inserted after a surgical procedure, or if the recommended healing time (usually 10-14 days) hasn't elapsed, removing them yourself can put you at greater risk for infection and may prevent your body from healing properly. [1] X Research source If you aren’t able to visit your doctor, you may be able to remove your stitches yourself, but only if the recommended amount of time has passed and your wound has closed completely. You should contact your doctor first to make sure that this is okay and get directions from them on how to do this safely. [2] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Keep in mind that when you go to the doctor, adhesive strips are often placed on the skin after stitch removal to continue to facilitate the healing process. If you do it at home, you may not be getting the care you require. [3] X Trustworthy Source FamilyDoctor.org Family-focused medical advice site run by the American Academy of Family Doctors Go to source If your wound looks as if it's getting red or more sore, do not remove your stitches—go to your doctor. You may have an infection. [4] X Research source In many cases, you can get your stitches removed without going through the regular doctor's appointment process. You might be able to walk right in for a quick stitch removal. It's likely that a nurse can check your wound and remove the stitches if the wound has healed. Call your doctor and ask."

      "content": "Choose a tool to cut your stitches. To remove your stitches, you’ll need a small pair of sharp scissors. [5] X Research source Use a sharp pair of surgical scissors if possible. Sharp nail scissors may also work, but avoid using any type of blunt edge, and don't use a knife—it's too easy for knives to slip."

      "content": "Sterilize your scissors and a pair of tweezers in boiling water. Drop them in a pot of boiling water, cover the pot, and let the tools boil for at least 20 minutes. Carefully remove them, let them thoroughly dry on a clean paper towel, then swab them thoroughly with a cotton ball soaked in rubbing alcohol. This will prevent the scissors and tweezers from transferring bacteria to your body.

Take off any jewelry and wash your hands with soap and warm water, making sure to scrub the front and back of both hands as well as in between your fingers. When you’re done, pat your hands dry on a clean paper towel. [7] X Research source"

Rinse the soap away with warm water, and pat the wound dry with a clean towel. Use a rubbing alcohol-soaked cotton ball to dab around the stitches. Be sure the area is completely clean before proceeding. [8] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Cleaning and disinfecting the area will help prevent an infection.

Don't attempt to remove your stitches in a place that's too dark, or you could accidentally cut yourself. If there isn’t enough natural light available, sit near a bright lamp so you can see what you’re doing."

Put the removed stitch aside on a piece of gauze or paper towel. [12] X Research source You might feel a bit of pressure as you remove the stitch, but it should not be painful. Do not pull the knot through your skin. It will catch on your skin and cause bleeding to occur. To avoid this, hold onto the knot itself with the tweezers as you pull out the stitch. If the skin starts to bleed when you remove the stitch, your stitches are not ready to come out. Stop what you're doing and see a doctor to remove the remaining stitches."

[16] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source For instance, you may need to avoid doing any heavy lifting until your doctor says it’s safe, since too much strain could cause the wound to reopen. If you’re concerned about the wound opening up again, put a series of Steri-Strips along the incision where the stitches used to be. These will help keep the edges of the wound together as it heals.
