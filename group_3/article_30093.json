      "content": "Remove the label and cut off the top of a plastic soda bottle. Draw a line with a marker around the neck of the plastic 2 L (0.53 US gal) soda bottle where the bottle’s mid-section becomes a straight cylinder. Use a razor, knife, or pair of scissors to cut along the line. Just make sure that whatever you choose is sharp enough to cut through the plastic bottle . Choose a clear or transparent bottle so you can easily see inside. You can use an opaque bottle that doesn’t have removable labels, but it’s harder to check if you’ve trapped any wasps. [1] X Research source You can use a different type of plastic bottle or carton to make this trap, but make sure that the opening of the bottle or carton is large enough for wasps to crawl through. [2] X Research source If you use a milk carton, draw the line around the top just under the natural crease that forms the triangular top. To prevent the bottle from slipping as you cut, place it on a slightly damp cloth or towel to help hold it in place."

      "title": "Coat the inside of the bottle and funnel with olive oil (optional).",
      "content": "Coat the inside of the bottle and funnel with olive oil (optional). Pour 1 teaspoon (4.9 mL) of olive oil onto a paper towel and use it to grease the inside of the bottle and funnel. The oil creates a slippery barrier the wasps won’t be able to climb, which makes the trap more effective. However, the oil can become tacky over time if you don’t maintain it or clean the bottle periodically. Try petroleum jelly if you don’t want to use olive oil."

      "content": "Flip the neck upside-down, place it into the bottle, and tape the edges. The neck of the bottle will serve as a funnel for the wasps to enter, but not exit, the trap. Then, tape the two pieces together along the cut edges to hold the funnel in place. Use clear packing tape so you can easily see when a wasp is inside the trap. [3] X Research source For opaque tape, like duct tape, cut the strip in half to keep the band of tape as narrow as possible. Make sure to remove the cap before placing the neck into the bottle."

      "content": "Tie the ends of a 12 in (30 cm) long string to each punched hole. This creates a handle to hang your wasp trap. Use any type of string you have around, but try to pick one that is sturdy enough to hold the weight of the trap and withstand any wind that might blow it around. [5] X Research source A sturdy twine or even an old shoelace would work well as a handle for the wasp trap."

      "title": "Use grease or meat scraps as bait during spring and early summer.",
      "content": "Use grease or meat scraps as bait during spring and early summer. Dilute the mixture with water to create a solution that helps drown the wasps. In the spring and early summer months, wasps focus on making nests and laying eggs, so they’ll be looking for protein sources. [6] X Trustworthy Source Penn State Extension Educational organization dedicated to delivering science-based information to people, businesses, and communities Go to source If you use meat during this time, you may even catch the queen wasp, which will force the rest of the nest to relocate. Meat baits also work to trap houseflies. Add a waterproof LED light at the bottom of the bottle to lure Brown Marmorated Stink Bugs."

      "title": "Bait the trap with something sweet during late summer and early fall.",
      "content": "Bait the trap with something sweet during late summer and early fall. Mix the sweet substance with water and liquid dish soap . In the later summer and early fall months, the wasps want more energy, so they look for carbohydrates in the form of sweet food. Some sweet options include sugar, lemon juice , or apple cider vinegar. You may have to experiment with the type and amount of sweet options to attract the wasps. [7] X Research source The dish soap will break the surface tension of the water and drown the wasp. Increase the amounts of water and soap as needed to fill your trap, but try and keep a ratio of 1 teaspoon (4.9 mL) of liquid dish soap for every 1 cup (240 mL)} of water. [8] X Research source If you would rather release the wasp than drown it, don’t add dish soap to the bait solution. Using dish soap coats any wasps that escape and eventually suffocates them. [9] X Research source Vinegar is often used as a natural wasp repellant , but studies have found that mixing apple cider vinegar with water can work as a bait for wasps because they’re attracted to the acetic acid in it.

      "title": "Pour the mixed bait solution into the funnel of the wasp trap.",
      "content": "Pour the mixed bait solution into the funnel of the wasp trap. Make sure there’s about 1–2 in (2.5–5.1 cm) of the solution inside the bottle. This is shallow enough to allow the wasps to access the inside of the trap but forces them to completely enter to access the bait. [11] X Research source If you’re using a bottle that’s shorter than the typical 2 L (0.53 US gal) plastic bottle, add less solution so there’s at least 2 in (5.1 cm) of space between the baiting solution and the opening of the funnel. If you plan to release the wasps, only add 1–3 tablespoons (15–44 mL) of the solution to the bottle. This is enough solution to attract the wasps, but not enough to drown them."

      "content": "Set up your trap outside on the ground, or hang it up high. Stand the trap on a small table or stool so it’s slightly elevated. Or, hang the trap from a fence post or a low tree branch. Traps that are hung about 4 feet (1.2 m) from the ground tend to catch more wasps than traps left on the ground. Don't want to place it in an area close to where you frequently hang out or work to avoid getting stung when the wasps start to come to the bait. Keep the trap about 27 feet (8.2 m) away from your main gathering area outside. [12] X Research source"

      "content": "At first, check the trap daily and clean it out every 3 days. Make sure you’re using the right bait and placing your trap in the right spot to attract the wasps by checking it at least once a day. After you know it’s working, remove the funnel and dispose of the bait and dead wasps every 3 days. [13] X Research source If you don’t catch any wasps, try relocating the trap to another area where you’ve seen the wasps, or try a different bait. If you let the trap fill up with dead wasps, it creates a place for other wasps to stand to avoid drowning. Make sure all the wasps in the trap are dead before removing the tape. Any live wasps in the trap will probably be very aggressive. Wear protective clothing and use extreme caution when releasing live wasps. Release them away from people in an uninhabited area, or they may alert the rest of their colony. [14] X Research source The dead body of a wasp releases a chemical that attracts the rest of the colony. Bury or flush the dead wasps to avoid attracting others. [15] X Research source"

Simply make more bait solution and use it to refill the trap. [16] X Research source Apply more olive oil or petroleum jelly if you used that to coat the inside of your trap. If the trap develops a rotten or sour smell, rinse it with hot water before filling it with more bait solution. If the smell persists, consider throwing it out and making another wasp trap or using apple cider vinegar to combat the smell."

      "content": "Tie bait to an 18 in (46 cm) stick and place it over the bucket. Try a protein bait like turkey, ham, or fish in the spring and early summer. In summer and early fall, use a slice of ripe fruit like an apple or pear. Tie the bait to a stick or narrow board. Then. place the stick across the bucket so the bait dangles 1–2 inches (2.5–5.1 cm) above the soapy water. [18] X Research source Place a wide mesh screen over the top of the bucket to prevent animals from eating the bait. This type of trap works best with a protein trap in the early spring because it’s more likely to trap a wasp queen, and the colony will leave the area to search for a new queen."
