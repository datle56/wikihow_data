      "content": "Slide your mattress into a heavy plastic mattress bag . If you have a large mattress, ask a friend or family member to help you. Line up the open end of the mattress bag with the top or bottom of your mattress. Then, slip the end of the mattress inside the bag and pull the bag along the length of the mattress until the mattress is completely inside the bag. [2] X Research source If you’re able to stand the mattress up on one end, slide the mattress bag down onto the mattress from above. Make sure you get a bag that fits your mattress. For example, if you have a queen-sized mattress, get a queen-sized bag. If you’re unable to find a bag that’s the same size as your mattress, buy a bag that’s a larger size. Heavy plastic mattress bags are available at moving supply stores, hardware stores, and online. Tip: Get a vacuum seal mattress bag instead of a mattress bag. Vacuum bags are sealable and have a built-in valve to help make compressing the mattress easier."

Just leave a hole at the end of the bag that’s large enough for your vacuum hose to fit through. [3] X Research source If the mattress bag is larger than the mattress, fold the excess plastic so it’s flush with the mattress and tape it down. Some plastic mattress bags are resealable, so you don’t have to use tape."

Then, slide the end of the hose into the hole you left in the mattress bag. [4] X Research source If the hole in the bag is too large for the vacuum hose, use tape to seal the bag around the hose and create an airtight seal. Use a heavy-duty household vacuum or a shop vacuum , if you have one. Another option is to use a one-way vacuum valve . Simply get a vacuum storage bag and cut off the valve. Then, secure the valve to the mattress bag with tape. Either attach the valve to a hole you leave in the bag or cut a new hole specifically for the valve."

It may take several minutes to remove all the air in the bag and compress your mattress, depending on its size and the strength of your vacuum. Help speed up the process by using your feet and hands to press down the mattress and remove excess air. [5] X Research source If you notice any holes or tears in the bag, cover them with tape to ensure the bag is as airtight as possible."

Then, start to tightly roll up the mattress. Go slowly and keep pushing down on the mattress as you roll; you want to remove as much air as possible. [6] X Research source Get a friend or family member to help you roll your mattress, especially if it’s queen or king-sized. Leave the vacuum on the whole time you’re rolling the mattress. The vacuum will continue to suck out any excess air from inside the bag. Rolling the mattress is similar to rolling a sleeping bag or down blanket. Keep the mattress compressed downwards while you roll it forward. Note : If you want to compress the mattress without a vacuum, get a few friends to compress the mattress with their hands as you roll it up."

Alternatively, secure your rolled mattress with ratchet straps or rope. Slip the middle of the strap under one end of the roll.
