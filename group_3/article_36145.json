      "title": "Back the truck up close to the bush.",
      "content": "Back the truck up close to the bush. Get a friend who has a pickup truck if you don’t have one yourself. It shouldn’t matter how much horsepower the truck has, but you’ll need a towing hitch. Never attempt this with any vehicle smaller than a truck. [1] X Research source If you don’t have a truck, you can rent one. You may not want to do this in case something goes wrong."

    {
      "title": "Wrap a towing chain around the bush.",
      "content": "Wrap a towing chain around the bush. Towing chains are designed to pull cars, so they’re strong enough for bushes. Warp the chain around the bottom of the bush’s trunk as close to the ground as you can get it. Loop the end of the chain in on itself to hold it in place. [2] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Hook the chain to the truck’s towing hitch.",
      "content": "Hook the chain to the truck’s towing hitch. Keep the rest of the chain as low to the ground as possible while doing this. The chain must always be attached to the hitch rather than a weaker part of the truck such as the bumper. [3] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Move everyone away from the area.",
      "content": "Move everyone away from the area. Take children and pets inside of the house. Ask any onlookers to stand back in case the chain snaps or something splinters. It’s for their own safety."
    },
    {
      "title": "Slowly drive the truck forward.",
      "content": "Slowly drive the truck forward. Press down lightly on the gas pedal and roll forward. Once the chain is off the ground and taut, stop moving. Doing this gives the bush a little tug, which may not remove it completely at first. [4] X Research source Avoid stomping down on the gas pedal. While driving fast may seem like a good idea, this can cause the chain to break as well as damage the truck or the ground."
    },
    {
      "title": "Back the truck up and drive forward again until the bush is removed.",
      "content": "Back the truck up and drive forward again until the bush is removed. Back the truck up towards the bush so the chain slackens, then drive forward again to give the bush another tug. Repeat this until the bush comes out of the ground."
    },
    {
      "title": "Put on gloves and long-sleeved clothing.",
      "content": "Put on gloves and long-sleeved clothing. Protect your skin before you begin the removal process. A long-sleeved shirt and long pants such as jeans protect you against scrapes. Slip a pair of gardening gloves over your hands as well."

      "title": "Trim away smaller branches with hedge clippers.",
      "content": "Trim away smaller branches with hedge clippers. Simply line up the branches between the clippers and shear them off. Work from the outside of the bush, slowly reducing the bush’s size. You usually do not need to remove all the outer branches since cutting the thicker branches in the center also gets rid of the smaller ones. [5] X Research source Use bypass loppers instead to make this a quick and easy job. You may also use a reciprocating saw, pruning saw, or hand saw."
    },
    {
      "title": "Saw thicker branches close to the trunk.",
      "content": "Saw thicker branches close to the trunk. Locate the branches in the center of the bush. Cut them as close to the trunk as possible. A chainsaw may also be used on large bushes. Put on safety gear, including a helmet, goggles, ear defenders, and a safety mitt. Avoid letting the chainsaw touch the ground."
    },
    {
      "title": "Cut the stump close to the ground with a saw.",
      "content": "Cut the stump close to the ground with a saw. Hold the hand saw or pruning saw flat and gradually cut through the stump. Cut the trunk to remove any remaining branches in your way. The lower you can cut the trunk, the more weight you’ll eliminate from the remaining part of the bush. Don't use a chainsaw once you get close to the ground, since it could cause kickback. If you're not planning on removing the roots, you can stop here. Use a sander to grind down the stump and apply weed killer to kill the bush stump. Weed killer ensures that the stump can’t sprout and that diseases like mold don’t form.

      "content": "Sever the roots with a saw or loppers. A pruning saw or reciprocating saw cuts through most roots easily. You can also use a hand saw or a pair of loppers. If you don’t have one of these, a pointed shovel can also sever roots on smaller bushes. Cut all the roots you see. [7] X Research source An axe or mattock are also viable options for chopping through the roots."

      "title": "Lift the stump with a shovel.",
      "content": "Lift the stump with a shovel. Push down on the shovel’s handle to raise the stump. Most likely it won’t come out at first because some of the roots are still attached. Continue digging and cutting roots to free the stump. It helps to have another person leverage the stump with the shovel while you pull upwards on the stump. You’ll have an easier time seeing and reaching the remaining roots."

      "content": "Recycle the bush parts. Some garbage collection services accept bundled branches and other plant material. Call them or check your service contract to find out. If they don’t, place the pieces in a yard waste bag and drive it to the nearest recycling center.

      "content": "Place the jack on the other side of the bush. Lay the jack on top of the other plywood stack. Be sure to use a strong jack, such as long, flat hydraulic jack. This type of jack is better at bearing weight and should have a mechanical arm that you can crank while standing behind it. [13] X Research source Scissor jacks, which often come packaged with cars, aren’t recommended. They’re a little more flimsy and only designed to lift your specific type of car."
