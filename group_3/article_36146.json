It tidies things up, and you can get things pretty smooth with a trimmer alone. Shaving can lead to ingrown hairs or an itchy bum. Regardless, even if you’re shaving, start with a trim to make things easier for the razor. [1] X Research source Hitch your leg up onto the edge of the tub, or the toilet, and use one hand to spread your cheeks so that you can have easier access to the more intimate areas. Use a small or rounded trimmer attachment so you can get all the hard to reach places without nicking your sensitive skin. Also, a specialized body hair trimmer works much better than a beard trimmer. A beard trimmer will do, but it’s not as precise or delicate."

Rub shaving cream or lotion onto the area that you want to shave, making sure you apply it in an even layer. Choose a shaving cream or lotion that won’t irritate your skin.

Once you have that in hand, shave in the same direction of hair growth to help prevent your skin from becoming irritated or getting razor burn, which is a common occurrence. When you’re shaving the hair off, be gentle and use light, fast movements. Use a damp towel to wipe off any extra shaving cream once you're finished.

Apply a thin layer of lotion to your butt, making sure to rub it in well. [5] X Research source Keep in mind that shaving is temporary, and the hair will start to grow back after just 1-2 days.

Make sure your wax isn’t too cold or too hot—wax that’s cold won’t be able to pull out the hairs, and if the wax is too hot, you could end up with burns or damaged skin. Follow the specific instructions that come with your wax kit, which will be different depending on the specific type of wax.

Since the hairs around your butt area are difficult to reach by yourself, it’s best to get them waxed off by a professional.

[16] X Research source Depilatory creams shouldn’t cause pain when you use them. If you apply one to your butt and feel a burning sensation, it could be that your skin is too sensitive for the cream and it should be rinsed off with cold water.

However, this option is pricey — an average session costs roughly $235 — and it usually takes at least 3 sessions for it to work efficiently. Also, it may not be effective on light-colored hairs, since the lasers need a dark target to work, says Richmond.
