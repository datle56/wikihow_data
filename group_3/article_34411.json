      "content": "Take a cutting below the node. Look at your plant and feel along its stems. Recognize a node by its thickness compared to the rest of the stem, its lighter shade of green, and by the presence of new stems and leaves. Once you have found a node that you wish to cut for propagation, cut .5–1 inch (1.3–2.5 cm) below the node with sharp scissors or gardening shears . [1] X Research source Sterilize your shears with rubbing alcohol. Let them dry before you cut! When selecting a node to cut, consider the appearance of your existing plant as well as the cutting. Make sure the plant will still have opportunities to reinvigorate its appearance after you make a cutting."

      "content": "Place the cutting in water. Fill a glass container with room-temperature water. Rainwater and distilled water are the best options, but if they are not available, use tap water that has been left out overnight. Place the cutting in the container so that the node is underwater, but its leaves are not. [2] X Research source Select a container that supports your cutting enough that it does not slide into the water. Remove stems, sheaths, and leaves that are close to the node before placing the cutting in water. To provide some additional support as the plant grows, dip about 1 inch (2.5 cm) of the stem into powdered rooting hormone before placing the cutting into water. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Change the water once per week. Also change the water if algae grows in the container or the water begins to appear cloudy, as this will reduce the risk of pathogens that could harm your cutting. Ensure that the new water is room temperature or slightly warmer and cut away any parts of the plant that are starting to dissolve in the water. [4] X Research source"

Marantas prefer bright conditions as long as the sunlight is indirect.

      "content": "Plant the cutting when the roots have reached 1–2 inches (2.5–5.1 cm) long. After about a month—though more or less time is often appropriate depending on an individual cutting’s growth—prepare to plant your cutting in a pot. Fill a small pot with a soil mixture of peat moss , compost , and perlite or vermiculite . [6] X Research source Compose the mix of approximately ½ peat moss, ¼ perlite or vermiculite, and ¼ compost. [7] X Research source You can compost at home too, but be sure that the compost is finished before you use it in soil. To pot the plant, create a small hole in the soil, gently place your cutting into it, then readjust the soil to fill in the hole and support the stem. If it struggles to stand on its own, use green garden tape to attach the plant to a small stake planted in the soil 1–2 inches (2.5–5.1 cm) from the stem. [8] X Research source You can create a makeshift stake with a piece of bamboo or an old chopstick.
