      "content": "Look for behavioral patterns. To us, cats can appear baffling or unpredictable, whereas in reality we are just poor are reading their body language and understanding what they are trying to tell us. But what we do know is that there are a number of distinct patterns involved with cat aggression. These can be broken into a series of situation-oriented categories that are not mutually exclusive. [1] X Research source Play aggression happens when cats take play too far. Fear/Defense aggression comes from the cat feeling endangered, vulnerable, or trapped. Territorial aggression is usually just among cats, but can be expressed toward humans and other animals. Petting aggression is not well understood, and may come from over-stimulation. Inter-Male aggression relies on the natural competitive nature between toms. Maternal aggression is the queen cat's instinctual protective response. Redirected aggression can come from frustration the cat cannot vent, which gets redirected toward another target, such as a nearby cat or person. Predatory aggression derives from cats whose predatory instincts are triggered. Pain aggression results from old or current sensations of pain. Idiopathic aggression is spontaneous, and may be a threat to the physical safety of those who come into contact with the cat."

      "content": "Recognize maternal cat aggression. Your cat may become aggressive after giving birth. Mothers have instincts to protect their offspring from potential danger. Maternal aggression can occur when a mother cat (called a “queen”) with her kittens is approached by people or other animals whom she perceives as a threat. It’s more often directed at other cats, but it can be directed toward people, as well. Queens can be quite aggressive when defending their young, especially in the first few days after birth. [3] X Trustworthy Source American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Leading organization dedicated to the prevention of animal cruelty Go to source Avoid handling kittens during the first few days of their lives. Introduce yourself slowly. Provide a low stress environment, keep visitors to a minimum, and avoid approaching or handling either the mother or her kittens if you are met with maternal aggression."

When entering the room with an aggressive cat, avoid eye contact and make sure the cat has have a clear escape route. Do not approach an aggressive cat unless necessary; it's better to let the cat come to you. If you have to handle the cat, wear thick gloves and long sleeves to avoid getting a scratch injury.

To a cat, play is connected to how it learns to hunt. Play aggression is the most common type of aggressive behavior owners see in their cats. [4] X Research source It’s believed that through play with each other, young cats learn to inhibit their bites and sheathe their claws when swatting. The degree to which individual cats learn to inhibit their rough play varies, and those who were orphaned or weaned early might never have learned to temper their play behavior. Long hours spent alone, without opportunities to play, and owners that encourage their cats to chase and play-attack people’s hands and feet contribute to play aggression.

This will enhance the bond between you and your pet, and help your cat work out some energy. For a truly aggressive cat you just need to be in the room, lying on the floor, eyes closed, with treats around you. This gives your cat time to build the confidence to know you are not a threat. Use a fishing pole toy to keep the cat away from your body when playing. Don’t resume playing until your cat is calm if it bites or scratches you. Do not encourage your cat to play with your hands, feet or any other body part. While it may be fun when you have a tiny kitten, it becomes painful and dangerous as your kitten grows up. Do not use toys that teach your cat to play with your hands, such as gloves with balls hanging from the fingers. If you do, your cat will be encouraged to direct his play at your hands. Do not physically punish your cat for rough play. If you hit your cat, she may perceive your actions as play or become fearful of your hands. Don't run from your cat or try to block its movement with your feet. These actions can cause your cat to intensify its play or become aggressive."

[8] X Trustworthy Source Animal Humane Society Leading animal welfare nonprofit organization providing medical care, training education, and resources for animal owners Go to source There are a number of techniques you can try: To build your cat's trust, find the cat's go-to treat and scatter some around the room during a play session. Try holding treats in your hand and dropping them to get the cat to come closer. Expose to aggression-causing stimuli at a safe distance, for short periods of time, then reward with food for non-aggressive behavior. For example, if your cat has an aggressive fear of a specific person, that person might stand at a distance that does not trigger aggressive behavior. When working with other cats, they might be kept in large cages at opposite ends of the room, on leashes, or in harnesses, so they can see the source of aggression, but not escape. After several hours, they might be brought closer together. After many such sessions, it should be possible for them to be close to each other, without becoming defensive."

The two cats should be able to smell and hear each other through the closed door, but there should be no physical contact. After a few days, switch the positions of the cats.
