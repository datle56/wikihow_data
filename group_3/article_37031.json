      "title": "Put your bicycle on its side with the chain facing up.",
      "content": "Put your bicycle on its side with the chain facing up. You can’t remove a tire while the bicycle is upright because it will fall over. The chain side, which is called the driving side, should always face up to avoid damaging it. You can also turn the bike upside down, resting it on its handlebars. Some people don’t like turning it upside down because the handlebars or seat can get damaged. As another option, you can invest in an upright bike stand that will hold your bicycle while you work on it. You can find these stands at some bicycle stores or online. Also, you can build one yourself."

      "title": "Adjust",
      "content": "Adjust your gears to the smallest ring if you’re removing the back tire. Usually, this will be the outer gear. Setting your chain on this outer, smaller gear will make it easier to remove the rear tire. [1] X Research source You don’t need to adjust the gears if you’re removing the front tire."

      "title": "Open and remove the quick release lever, if your bike has one.",
      "content": "Open and remove the quick release lever, if your bike has one. Look for the quick release lever at the center of your bicycle wheel. Pull up on the lever, then turn it 180 degrees to loosen it. Remove the lever from the axle and set it aside. [2] X Research source If your quick release lever doesn’t come off after you turn it 180 degrees, keep turning it until you can remove it. If you’re not sure how to remove your bicycle tire, it’s best to check your bicycle manual or the manufacturer’s website."

      "title": "Use a wrench to loosen the nuts if you don’t have a quick release lever.",
      "content": "Use a wrench to loosen the nuts if you don’t have a quick release lever. Hook the wrench onto the nut, then turn to loosen it. Continue turning the nut until it comes off. Remove the wheel nuts on both sides of the bike. [3] X Research source If you can’t get the nut loose, you can spray it with WD-40 or cooking spray to make it easier to loosen it. A 15mm wrench is usually the correct size for loosening the nuts on a bicycle."

      "title": "Detach the brake cables if necessary.",
      "content": "Detach the brake cables if necessary. In many cases, opening the quick release lever also detaches the brakes. If your model doesn’t have this feature, squeeze the calipers on the brakes to release the cables. [4] X Research source Check your bicycle manual or the manufacturer’s website if you’re having trouble detaching your brakes . Instructions vary for different bike models."

      "title": "Lift the wheel off the frame.",
      "content": "Lift the wheel off the frame. Pull the tire out of the forked slot that supports it on the bicycle. You may need to slightly shift the bike tire as you remove it. If you’re removing a back tire, you may need to lift the bicycle chain out of the way."

    {
      "title": "Deflate the tire",
      "content": "Deflate the tire completely. Loosen the cap on the air valve. If it comes completely off, set the cap aside. Release the air using the correct procedure for your air valve type. This will make it easier to remove. [5] X Research source If your bicycle has a Schrader (American) valve, use a small tool, such as your wrench, to press down on the plunger inside the air valve to release the air. If you have a Presta valve, unscrew and pull up on the valve cap to release the air. If you have a Dunlop valve, take off the cap, then pull up on the air valve to release the air."

      "title": "Hook the rounded edge of a tire lever under the outer edge of your tire.",
      "content": "Hook the rounded edge of a tire lever under the outer edge of your tire. This will pop up the edge of the tire, releasing it from the frame. Pull the other end of the lever down toward the spokes. Next, hook the other end of the lever onto a wheel spoke to keep the edge of the tire popped up. [6] X Research source If you don’t hook the other end of the lever onto a spoke, your tire will go back into place and reseal itself around the wheel. The outer edge of a bicycle tire is called a “bead.” You can find inexpensive tire levers at a bicycle store, outdoor store, or online. You may be able to remove your tire with a spoon or screwdriver, but they can damage your tire."

A dust cap and lock ring may be on your air valve, and you will need to remove them. Loosen or remove the air valve cover so you can add air to the tire. [7] X Research source"

Use your eyes, a cloth, or a gloved finger to check the surface of the tire. [9] X Research source If you find something stuck into the tire, remove it if you plan to patch the tire. Don’t put a new tube inside your bicycle tire without checking for a puncture . If there is an item like a thorn or nail stuck in your tire, it will likely puncture the new tube."

Make sure there are no bends, twists, or kinks in the tube. [10] X Research source The entire tube should be inside the tire before you proceed. If you're having trouble getting the tube fully inside, take it out and start over. You may need to let out some of the air you put in to help it hold its shape."

      "title": "Buy a new set of tires only if you can’t repair it or the treads are worn.",
      "content": "Buy a new set of tires only if you can’t repair it or the treads are worn. You can usually repair a flat just by changing the tube. However, your tire may need to be replaced if it’s damaged beyond repair. This might mean a large break or puncture. It may also be beyond repair if the treads are worn down, the tire is dry rotted, or the tire is very old. If this is the case, you can buy a new set of tires from a local bike store or online. You’ll need to buy a set of tires labeled for use on your bicycle model. It’s best to get them from the manufacturer. Tires are sold folded up in a package. Usually, the package will contain a set of tires. Always change both tires if you need to change one. Otherwise, the tires won’t match and you risk having a blow out on one of them, particularly the older tire."

      "title": "Work the tire back onto the wheel on one side.",
      "content": "Work the tire back onto the wheel on one side. Put the air valve in the air valve hole. Then, align the outer rim on one side with the wheel. Push the rim back into place along the wheel frame. Check your tire for an arrow that tells you which direction the treads should face. This is called the “direction of travel.” If your tire has an arrow, make sure it’s facing forward. Some tires can go in either direction and won’t have this arrow. Don’t use any tools to replace the tire. This can damage or puncture the tire or tube. Just use your fingers. Use this same process to put the tire on the wheel frame whether it's the old tire or a new tire."

    {
      "title": "Fit the other side of the tire back onto the wheel frame.",
      "content": "Fit the other side of the tire back onto the wheel frame. Make sure the tube is completely under the tire. Next, put your fingers on one side of the air valve and press the tire into place. Work your way around the wheel frame, pushing the tire onto the frame. Finish over the air valve, which will be the loosest part of the tire when it’s on the frame. Make sure there are no bulges on the tire, which could mean the tube is bunched up, twisted, or pinched. You may have to use tire levers at the end of the process, but be very careful not to puncture the tube or tire. Putting your tire back on the wheel can be very difficult, especially if your tire is new. However, you can get it back on with just your hands."

      "title": "Screw the lock ring down over your air valve if there is one.",
      "content": "Screw the lock ring down over your air valve if there is one. Some tubes come with a lock ring that goes down over the air valve. It will hold your tube in place on the wheel. Align the lock ring with the threads on the air valve, then screw it down. [11] X Research source If your bike tube didn’t have a lock ring, skip this step."

    {
      "title": "Inflate your tire to the correct pressure level.",
      "content": "Inflate your tire to the correct pressure level. You can use a manual or electric air pump to air up the tires. Fit your pump onto the air valve, then air up the tires. Once the tires reach the correct pressure level, put on the air valve cap. The correct pressure level should be listed on your tire wall. You can also check your bicycle manual or look it up online."

Then, slide the lever or metal bar that holds the wheel back into place. Tighten the easy release lever or nuts, using a wrench if necessary. Close the easy release lever, if your bike has one. [12] X Research source If you fixed your back tire, you’ll need to lift the chain to put it back on. Check that the wheel spins freely."
