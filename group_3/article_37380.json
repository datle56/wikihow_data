      "content": "Pay attention to her tone of voice and body language. Consider why she is asking. If you have an idea about how she feels, it will help you have a more productive conversation with her. We communicate mainly through our tone of voice and body language, so try to understand what is going on using these signals. [1] X Research source If she is raising her eyebrows, she might be uncomfortable. This might mean that she does not want you to like her. [2] X Research source If she is mirroring your body language, then you are probably connecting. Perhaps she hopes that you like her back or she feels connected to you and wants you to know that she doesn’t want the same thing. [3] X Research source If she is making lots of eye contact, this shows interest. But it could go both ways, she could be interested in knowing how you feel because you are close and she doesn’t want to hurt you, or because she likes you. [4] X Research source A group of gestures together shows that she feels connected to you. For example, if she is smiling, she has her head titled to the side, and she is holding or touching her face at the same time, this could mean that she does like you. However, always believe what she says over any of the signals you get. [5] X Research source Crossed legs and arms may mean that she is trying to stay closed off to you. This might mean that she is anxious or resistant to your feelings. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Do not assume too much.",
      "content": "Do not assume too much. Once you have considered how she feels and evaluated her body language, you do not have to over think her feelings for you. The truth is that you do not know for sure how she feels. And you will not know until you have asked her straight out how she feels. And believe what she says over the other signals you feel like you may be getting. Do not feel bad about what you think she feels or thinks. This is not going to help you stay confident, and it is also probably not accurate."

      "title": "Think about whether she is already seeing someone.",
      "content": "Think about whether she is already seeing someone. This will help you to know how to talk to her. If she has a crush on someone else or is with someone else, you will want to approach this conversation differently. You would know because you may have heard other people talk about it, or she may talk about it herself. If you do know she is with someone else, acknowledge it at the start of the conversation. You will need to say that you do not want to step on her relationship. Stay a little more reserved or distant in your conversation, while still remaining honest. You can ask her, do you want me to tell you about my feelings? Sometimes when a person asks a question they are not interested in hearing a sincere answer. For example, in this instance she may be trying to point out that you are acting like you like her. Being honest and straightforward in your question “do you want me to be honest?” will be the best way to deal with this possibility. Stay further away from her physically and emotionally if she is with someone. Getting close to her or being very open and honest might make her feel uncomfortable. You will want to keep your distance."

      "content": "Think about whether she can date. Do you know whether she is allowed to date? Some people may be interested in dating but have parents who are strict about dating rules. If you know that she isn’t allowed to date, you may want to acknowledge this fact in the conversation. Try to make her feel comfortable if she seems worried about her parents. Tell her that you do not want to step on her relationship with her parents. In this case you may not need to tell her that you have a crush on her. You can simply acknowledge that she is not allowed to date. Keep your distance physically to help her feel comfortable."

      "title": "Ask her if you two can talk somewhere.",
      "content": "Ask her if you two can talk somewhere. If you feel like she genuinely wants to know how you feel, you may want to have this conversation somewhere quiet. Think about going to a place where you can talk uninterrupted. You want to have this conversation in a space where you are comfortable to talk about how you feel openly. This can be a great opportunity to show her how cool you are regardless of why she is asking. If you can tell her how you feel and remain cool, calm, and collected, she will respect you all the more. Going on a walk can be a good option for a conversation like this. Walking can take away some of the awkwardness involved in the conversation. Walking is great because you are moving, not sitting and looking at each other. Going to a restaurant or coffee shop can also work if it is not busy. If you can find a secluded table to sit at or a table outside, this can be ideal. Go to a park. Sit on the swings or find a bench where the two of you can talk."

      "content": "Look her in the eye and say “Yes, I do have a crush on you.” Once you have had a minute and you are situated you can own how you feel, and be confident. Be careful not to try to force her to feel the same way. Say that you like her in a way that is free of further implication. Free of implication means that you are not communicating a different message through your body language or tone. For example, do not look very intently at her in a way that asks her to like you back. Or do not lean forward into her space unless you know that she likes you. You could ask her how she feels before you say anything. However, it is more attractive and confident if you own how you feel and speak first."

Simply ask “why are you asking?” Do not assume that you know why she is asking. Once again, keep your tone and body language free of implication. Do not suggest that you know why she is asking with a flirty or accusing tone. Focus fully on what she is saying. Show interest, nod, smile and communicate that you understand through your body language and noises.

If she does not like you, do not make her feel bad for not liking you. Even if you honestly feel like she should like you, it is not your place to tell her that or make her feel that way."

      "content": "Talk about what you should do about your feelings. If she doesn’t feel the same way, you might want to ask her if she still wants to be friends. If you do not feel like you two can be friends, ask if you can have space. If she does like you, ask her whether she would like to start dating. Try not to assume what will happen between you two if she says she has a crush on you, too. Instead, communicate with her how she feels about dating. If you want to start dating, ask her about what dating means to her and explain what dating means to you. You want to make sure that you are talking about the same thing. You may also want to discuss relationship expectations you have and ask her about her's. This may be a full conversation in itself, and one you come back to periodically.

      "content": "Follow up with her about the conversation later. Because it can be an awkward conversation, you may want to avoid talking about it. However, embrace the awkwardness and be confident. If you are still friends but she does not like you, you can simply tell her “thanks for having that conversation with me; I appreciated it.” You can also follow up over text message, but keep it brief. Do not try to change her mind, instead, acknowledge the conversation and then move on."

Do not let her romantic feelings change the way you feel about yourself. [10] X Research source If she is not interested and does not have mutual feelings, don't pursue her. Think about it from her perspective. The more you understand her, the easier it will be to realize that it is not about you. [11] X Research source Avoid jumping to conclusions. You don’t know why she doesn’t like you. Be careful not to assume that it is because of something particular about you. Make some space between you and your immediate reaction. Try to suppress any initial panicked emotions. Realize that your feelings will subside and wait for them to do so before you speak or do anything."

When you truly like yourself, it has an awesome effect- other people want to be around you more. Speak to yourself as a friend. You should offer yourself the same compassion, love and support you would to a friend who is going through a hard time. Imagine yourself confident and free. In your mind visualize what you would look like if you were perfectly confident and happy. What would you look like? Strive for being that person. Think about that person when you are in doubt about yourself."

You are in a better position because you don’t have to spend more time wondering about her. Being open and honest is a good habit to get into.

Go out with your friends. Spend time with good friends who make you feel good about yourself. These people will remind you of your interests and the other things that you love. Distance yourself from her. If you are having a hard time with your emotions, tell her that you’d like some time and space from your relationship.
