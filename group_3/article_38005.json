      "content": "Embrace your spirituality and intellectual self. As a fixed air sign, Aquarius loves to think about things in unique and abstract ways. They tend to view the universe in an inspiring and philosophical way. Since Saturn represents goals and achievement, embracing this Aquarian love of the metaphysical and larger-than-life questions will serve you well in your future plans. Becoming more spiritual is a life-long journey. It’s best to start small. Read a book or attend a lecture about a spiritual practice that’s always interested you. You can study earnest topics like the afterlife and journey of the soul or discover something silly like Pastafarianism !"

      "content": "Place yourself in leadership positions as much as possible. A unique air sign, Aquarius has a natural gift for inspiring others. And Saturn is great at turning big dreams into small, incremental steps. This combo means having you at the helm of any project will ensure that it’s achievable. Your planning skills are sublime; you just need to be in a role where these plans can easily be put in motion. [2] X Research source With this placement, you already have a lot of the qualities of a good leader: kindness, confidence, conflict management. But being a leader is also about being proactive .

      "content": "Focus on your friendships as well as your ambitions. A Saturn in Aquarius means you may find social activities stressful and disappear into your head as a defense. Embrace your Aquarian love of community and nurture your relationships when you feel yourself withdrawing too much into your own brain (no matter how brilliant it is). [3] X Research source Being a good friend is easy. It just requires support and quality time. Try and schedule at least an hour a week to hang with your buddies. You can go to a movie, grab coffee, or just chill at one of your houses. In addition, affirm your friends regularly. Remind them they’re capable people who mean a lot to you. It’ll make a world of difference!"

      "title": "Saturn’s move into Aquarius signals a time of achievement and friendship.",
      "content": "Saturn’s move into Aquarius signals a time of achievement and friendship. As each planet orbits around the sun, it crosses into various placements for each sign. When Saturn moves into the Aquarius placements, it has a slowing effect on everyone. Saturn is a planet of conservation and reflection and Aquarius is the sign of principles, big ideas, and community. Saturn in Aquarius puts pressure on all of us to re-evaluate our long term goals, and prioritize quality time with people who love us and make us feel accomplished. [4] X Research source Because Aquarius and Saturn are melancholy, this transit can feel sad while it’s happening. However, the lessons this transit teaches us are invaluable and usually make us feel renewed once Saturn moves on to the next zodiac placement (Pisces). Saturn moved into Aquarius in January 2023 and is expected to stay there until 2025, before another 30 year disappearance."

      "title": "Saturn returns are life-altering transits that happen every 29 years.",
      "content": "Saturn returns are life-altering transits that happen every 29 years. When you’re born, Saturn is at a specific degree in its orbit. Each degree is controlled by a different sign. A Saturn return is when Saturn has gone through its full cycle and returns to the sign it was at when you came into the world. Saturn takes 29 years to travel, so your first Saturn return occurs right before your 30th birthday, the next one comes when you’re 58, and so on. Saturn returns last 2-3 years each time."

      "title": "Saturn returns are challenges to confront your fears and goals.",
      "content": "Saturn returns are challenges to confront your fears and goals. Saturn is the planet of fear, restrictions, and discipline. Every Saturn return is meant to trigger these fears and force you to evaluate what you want to accomplish out of life. Saturn returns are often painful (having your biggest insecurities challenged can feel daunting and despairing at times), but extremely rewarding in the long run. Saturn will reward your hard work like no other planet."

      "title": "Saturn retrograde challenges every sign’s sense of purpose and responsibility.",
      "content": "Saturn retrograde challenges every sign’s sense of purpose and responsibility. Retrogrades occur when planets move backward in their orbit instead of forward. Retrogrades often give the reverse effect of a forward-moving planet. Therefore, since Saturn is the planet of work and payback, Saturn retrogrades negatively affect our ability to concentrate, make our responsibilities more difficult, and make it feel like we’re not being rewarded for any of our actions. Saturn retrogrades can feel Sisyphean, but they only last about 4.5 months each year. In fact, planets don’t actually move backwards. This is an optical illusion caused by Earth’s orbit!"

      "title": "For Aquarius placements, Saturn retrogrades force you to look at your inner self.",
      "content": "For Aquarius placements, Saturn retrogrades force you to look at your inner self. Because Aquarius is all about community and humanity at large, Saturn retrograde often forces Aquarius Saturns to look at the most minute details of their personal lives. In Saturn retrograde, you might feel heavily scrutinized or hyper-conscious of how you come off in social situations. Try and use your Aquarian optimism and intellect to counteract any doubts you might have about yourself during retrograde. For example, you can use your objective reasoning to remind yourself “I don’t have the energy to judge anyone during Saturn retrograde. Saturn retrograde is hard for everyone. That means others probably don’t have time to judge me harshly, because they’re struggling too.”"

      "content": "Aries needs to learn to fully commit to their lifelong dreams. If you’re an Aries , Saturn looks over your 11th house of long term goals. A cardinal fire sign, you’re naturally spontaneous and great at putting short-term plans into motion. But now is the time to double down and commit to your long-term goals or scrap them altogether. Achieving long-term goals can feel like a tall task, but it’s quite simple as long as you keep your plans manageable and specific. Start with the easy steps first and use precise language when goal setting. For example, saying “I’ll be a doctor one day” might seem too ambitious because it’s vague. Instead, you might say “I will get into med school in the next 3 years.” Then, figure out what the easiest first step is. “I will research affordable, quality med schools today” is a great starting place and it’s a goal you can easily do right here and now."

      "content": "Taurus must achieve tangible results to improve their career. Saturn in Aquarius rules Taurus’ 10th house of job and social status. As a fixed Earth sign, you’re likely already putting the work in to make good money. But Saturn in Aquarius is a reminder that concrete achievements are as important as discipline. You need solid results to point to if you want that promotion or raise. [5] X Research source Create an accomplishment report to easily articulate and visualize what you’ve done in your career so far. Make note of ways you increased output or revenue, how you handled new clients, and other ways you’ve improved your workplace."

      "content": "Gemini can take more risks personally and intellectually. Saturn in Aquarius passes through Gemini’s 9th house of adventure, meaning it’s time for you to do just that. Visit a completely new place (if you’re in academics, now’s a great time to study abroad) or pursue another form of higher learning. Saturn in Aquarius also marks a deeply introspective period for Gemini. Now is the time to develop a belief system you stick by. While your ability to adapt to new ideas on the fly is admirable, so is discovering your own philosophy."

      "content": "Cancer must face their control issues to have more meaningful relationships. If you’re a Cancer, Saturn in Aquarius triggers your 8th house of intimacy. As the planet of challenge and restraint, Saturn is testing your patience and ability to truly let a relationship breathe. Let go of control by giving your loved ones space. Allow them to come to you for support and affection, rather than trying to anticipate their every need. [6] X Research source Be conscious of how you might use guilt to control your relationships. Cancers are like intimacy superheroes, but not everyone has your emotional skill set. Avoid passive aggressive behavior like sulking and comparing yourself to others."

      "content": "Leo will be reminded to focus on 1-on-1 relationships. Saturn passes through Leo’s 7th house of partnerships. As a fire sign ruled by the sun, you likely thrive in crowds and love the spotlight. However, this transit is telling you that being the center of attention won’t create long-lasting emotional fulfillment. Hang out with people individually and nurture those relationships as much as you nurture your persona in group settings. [7] X Research source As a fixed sign, you’re naturally non-judgemental and accept everyone for who they are. Show that side of yourself by maintaining a more gentle demeanor in conversations, and actively listening in intimate settings. A great way to show you’re actively listening is to restate someone’s feelings in your own words. For example, you might say “It sounds like you’re really frustrated with your boss” or “based on what you said, you seem like you’re really happy. I’m happy for you!”"

      "title": "Virgo will learn not to overextend themselves.",
      "content": "Virgo will learn not to overextend themselves. The sign of growth and routine, if you’re a Virgo, you’re highly ambitious and go beyond the call of duty to serve others. Saturn in Aquarius may challenge this, causing you to feel less productive and more burnt-out. Embrace these feelings instead of fighting them. Take time off work, drop one of your many projects, and focus on healing and relaxation. Easy ways to stop working so hard include: limiting the number of assignments you take on, setting a strict deadline each day to stop working, or filling your life with other fulfilling hobbies (like painting, fitness, or socializing) so work isn’t everything you do."

      "content": "Libra must be realistic with their creative and romantic ideas. Symbolized by the scales, Libra is balanced and kind, but your Venusian rulership can cause you to slip into superficial patterns. Saturn in Aquarius will force you to re-examine the ways your relationships are just going through the motions or the “creative endeavors” you aren’t passionate about. Look at how your perfectionism blocks you from finishing projects or inhibits you from achieving true intimacy. Saturn in Aquarius passes through Libra’s 5th house of romance. In your relationships, take some time to learn the difference between love and lust. Focus on how secure you feel, how you handle conflict, and if you truly see yourself with this person or if your love of beauty is giving you rose-colored glasses."

      "content": "Scorpio needs to nurture their family and personal life. Saturn in Aquarius governs Scorpio’s 4th house of home and intimacy. As a fixed water sign, this is a great placement for you. Use your compassion and intensity to go all in on creating a home base you feel safe in. Spend quality time with family and establish firm boundaries that separate your work and personal life. Put your phone away and log out of work emails when you get home each day. Be present with those who share your private space. Nurturing your family life can also mean cutting out toxic family members who make you feel drained or invade your personal space."

Sign up for online classes, participate in a workshop for a skill you’ve always wanted to learn, or go back to school. Saturn in Aquarius promotes the expansion of your ideas and how you articulate them. Remember that learning is supposed to be fun. It may take you a little while to find a subject you’re passionate about. While you’re likely to succeed in intellectual pursuits, don’t pursue something that bores you or makes you miserable."

      "title": "Capricorn will need to declutter their financial and work life.",
      "content": "Capricorn will need to declutter their financial and work life. Saturn in Aquarius comes directly after Saturn in Capricorn (your ruling planet), so you’ve likely seen a lot of financial growth and success recently. Now, it’s time to trim the fat. Your 2nd house of income and material wealth is being targeted, so cut unnecessary expenses, create a more responsible budget, and examine why money matters to you. What do you value? What’s worth the long hours at your job? [8] X Research source Cutting expenses doesn’t always mean you have to make the pragmatic choice. As a cardinal Earth sign, you’re already responsible financially. If an expensive wine every month makes you happy, that’s a worthwhile cost. Don’t cut just because you feel like you should. Spending more wisely can be as simple as finding a cheaper insurance plan or getting a Costco membership so you can buy groceries in bulk"

      "title": "Aquarius should take on more personal responsibilities.",
      "content": "Aquarius should take on more personal responsibilities. Saturn in Aquarius passes through Aquarius’ 1st house of self, which symbolizes a deeply personal journey. It's telling you you’re ready for more power and influence in your life, so don’t shy away from opportunities just because they’re more work. This is a period of expansion for you; you can handle new duties. In fact, your life will be more enriched because of them! Seize new opportunities each day by making a list of goals for yourself. Try to cross off one goal each week. They can be big (like applying to your dream job) or small (like trying birch beer). Alternatively, make a list of things you’re afraid of. Schedule a time to face each fear. Start with small things and work your way up. For example, if you’re scared of heights, you might start by jumping off the high diving board at the community pool. Then, gradually increase the height until you’re ready to skydive."

      "content": "Pisces must forgive themselves for regrets and disappointments. Saturn in Aquarius passes through Pisces’ ruling house, the 12th house of spirituality and the unknown. Saturn is asking you to reflect on your past and let go of what’s holding you back. This is a highly existential transit, encouraging you to revisit all your life’s obstacles and conquer them before moving forward with a clean slate. Luckily, as the final sign of the zodiac, you’re already great at this! [9] X Research source Try doing some shadow work to work through past shames or regrets. Have a direct conversation with the parts of you that you don’t want to claim. Write your shadow a letter, tell it to shut up, or fight back with positive, affirming statements. It can help to name your shadow so you understand this version of you isn’t your true authentic self."
