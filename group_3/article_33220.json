If “Kiss, Marry, Kill” feels a little too extreme, there are other versions of the game that work the same way but have different wording.

In this version, you’re choosing who you’d “ghost” (stop texting, calling, and speaking to) instead of kill. Hug, Roast, Block. Decide which person you’d hug, which one you’d roast (jokingly insult), and which one you’d block (from your contacts on your phone, for example). Kiss, Marry, Prank. This is another, more lighthearted version of the game where you’re choosing someone to prank instead of kill. Karaoke, Vacation, Unfollow . In this version, decide who you’d sing a karaoke duet with, who you’d go on vacation with, and who you’d unfollow on social media. Borrow, Steal, Destroy. Instead of people, this version of the game deals with items. What would you borrow, what would you steal, and what would you destroy? Date, Dump, Friendzone. Decide who you’d want to date, who you’d inevitably end up dumping, and who you’d remain forever friends (but nothing more) with. Hire, Fire, Promote. For a workplace-themed game, decide who you’d hire as an employee, who you’d end up firing, and who would earn a promotion."
