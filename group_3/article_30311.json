      "content": "Get or cut 8 equally sized square sheets of paper. These will form the basic components of the transforming ninja star. The larger the square sheets are, the larger your ninja star will be. A good size is around the size of standard sticky notes. Sticky notes will work, but there is a specific way to fold the modules so that the adhesive portion doesn't get in the way."

Fold the paper in half on one side and open it back up. You should have an X with one horizontal line through it made from the creases. If using sticky notes, make sure the vertical line goes through the adhesive."

      "content": "Follow the above steps with the first 6 module pieces. The 7th and 8th modules are a little trickier because the pieces begin to overlap, but still follow the same concept. When adding the 7th piece, make sure the front of the first piece is in-between the back flaps of the 7th piece. Slide the 8th piece into place, following the same pattern as the rest of the pieces with the front of the piece fitting in-between the 2 folded-in edges of the 7th piece and back flaps on either side of the first piece. When folding the flaps back edges in, you will notice that there is already another piece in the way. Fold the flaps in on either side of the piece already in the crevice, by holding the middle piece to the side while folding the edges in on either side. Do this with both the edges of the 7th piece as well as the edges of the 8th piece. You should now have a fully interlocked octagonal shape. This is the untransformed version of the ninja star."
