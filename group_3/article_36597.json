      "title": "Dab the wet wax with paper towels.",
      "content": "Dab the wet wax with paper towels. Act fast if wax spills on wool by grabbing a few paper towels and dabbing the mess. Avoid rubbing, which may spread the wax and embed it deeper into the fibers of your wool item. Remove as much wax as you can this way for approximately a minute before the wax begins to harden. [1] X Research source Do not continue to dab the wax once it starts drying, as bits of the paper towel might get stuck in the mess."

      "title": "Leave the wax untouched for at least an hour to let it harden.",
      "content": "Leave the wax untouched for at least an hour to let it harden. Give the wax an hour or more to dry before attempting to remove any more of it. The wax will be easiest to remove if it is solid. Go back to the spill once the wax is completely hardened. [2] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Chill the wax stain.",
      "content": "Chill the wax stain. To harden the wax more quickly to make it easier to remove, place a bowl of ice cubes on top of it. Leave it there for several minutes until the wax is frozen. The size of the bowl and the amount of time you leave it on the stain will depend on the size of the wax spill. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Use a blunt knife or spoon to chip away the wax.",
      "content": "Use a blunt knife or spoon to chip away the wax. Gently scrape the surface of the wax stain with a spoon or blunt knife. Scrape away as much wax as possible without digging into the fibers very hard. Be gentle as wool is a very delicate fabric that may be easily damaged."
    },
    {
      "title": "Vacuum away the pieces of wax.",
      "content": "Vacuum away the pieces of wax. Use a vacuum cleaner to clear away wax debris from the wool. Avoid sweeping or wiping away the wax, which may end up embedding it deeper into the fibers. Use a handheld vacuum or a vacuum with a hose attachment to target the wax precisely.

    {
      "title": "Blot the remaining stain with rubbing alcohol.",
      "content": "Blot the remaining stain with rubbing alcohol. Since wax is an oil-based stain, it requires a solvent that dissolves oil. Wet a cotton ball with rubbing alcohol and gently dab the surface of the stain. Continue this until the stain disappears. [5] X Research source Never use ammonia or bleach as stain removers on wool, as they can damage it. In a pinch, nail polish remover will also remove wax stains."

    {
      "title": "Place a plain paper bag over the wax spill area.",
      "content": "Place a plain paper bag over the wax spill area. Cut open a paper bag and lay it in a single layer over the stain. If it is too large, cut it to be about the same size as the wax stain. Avoid using a paper bag with anything printed on it, as the ink may transfer to the wool. [6] X Research source You can also use transfer paper for this method. [7] X Expert Source Kamel Almani Laundry & Cleaning Specialist Expert Interview. 13 April 2021."
