There’s no max number, though, and you can play with even more if you want, like in a classroom. [1] X Research source Generally speaking, the more people you rope in, the more chaotic your session will be, but that can be a good thing!"

Give each player a sticky note or an index card and tell them to write down the name of a person, like a character or a celebrity. Keep these a secret for now! [2] X Research source Make sure you write clearly so that other people can read it. To make the game a little easier, decide on a theme as a group beforehand, like “celebrities” or “characters from movies.” Or, decide to go without a theme to make the game a bit more of a challenge. Remind players to choose people that anyone in the group could guess, and to stay away from more obscure or niche people that might be tough for some players. For example, if you're doing historical figures, a few names you might put on include Abraham Lincoln, George Washington, and Alexander the Great."

They ask questions in the format of “Am I…?” As they’re asking questions, they’re trying to narrow down the possibilities to try to guess the answer, like playing a game of 20 Questions. [5] X Research source There’s no hard limit on how many questions they get, but you might want to cap it at 20, just to make sure the game moves quickly. As the player who’s asking questions, start with broad, general questions, like, “Am I a person, place, or thing?” “Am I young?” “Am I famous?” Then, as you learn more, make your questions more specific, like, “Have I won any awards?” “Have I been in an animated movie?” “Am I a villain, or a hero?” Only guess specific answers once you’re pretty sure you know what the answer is. Try to make it so that your questions have yes-or-no answers. Otherwise, the group might get a little rowdy as they all try to answer at once, and you’ll miss what they say."

Generally, keep your answers to “yes” or “no” so that the player who’s guessing can easily hear them and so you don’t give too much away. Keep answering their questions until they run out of guesses, or until they guess it right. [6] X Research source If multiple people in the group disagree, then feel free to talk it out, but don’t give the answer away! You might want to whisper so the player who’s “it” doesn’t hear. Sometimes, a player might ask a question that doesn’t have a yes-or-no answer. That’s okay! Keep the answer as simple as you can, and remind them to only ask yes-or-no questions. Be honest! Lying to the guessing player is cheating, and ruins the fun."

Keep playing until everyone’s had a chance to guess what’s on their sticky note. [7] X Research source This is a low-stakes, casual icebreaker, so there’s not really any winning or losing. To make the game more competitive, though, keep track of who guessed their answer right, and in how many guesses. The player with the fewest guesses wins. If the player runs out of guesses or gives up, feel free to give them more specific hints, but don’t reveal the answer unless they want you to."

Feel free to change the rules to make it your own or to make it easier for a certain group to play. There’s no “wrong” way to play it, as long as everyone’s having fun. For example, you might set a timer for the person guessing to make it more fun and frantic. Remove the yes-or-no answers rules in smaller groups to make the game less predictable. Draw pictures on the sticky notes instead of words to make the game more of an artistic challenge. You might give the person guessing a certain number of clues, like telling them the first letter of the answer."

For example, the game \"Botticelli\" follows the same rules, but players can only write down historical figures (that are at least as famous as the Italian painter Sandro Botticelli) but invert some of the rules. In \"Botticelli,\" players choose their own identities and give other players the initials of their identities. Celebrity\" is another variation of the game. Players write the names of a bunch of different celebrities on slips of paper and put them into a hat. From there, a player will take a name out of the hat and offer clues to other players. So long as the clues do not mention the name directly, any statement is fine. The goal is to get other players to figure out your celebrity as fast as possible. Or, pick up an “official” version of the game, like Headbanz or the Heads Up! app."

Am I an athlete? Am I an animal? Am I someone who’s popular or well-liked? Am I someone I would know personally? Am I still alive? Am I known for a specific act? Am I known for my career? Am I a politician? Am I a scientist? Am I an artist? Am I the first person to have done something big? Am I someone who speaks English? (Or another language) Am I a hero? Or a villain?"

Instead, they must coordinate and pitch in when they feel like it’d be useful. The player who’s guessing must learn to ask the right questions and use the answers to keep forming better questions. This makes it a great critical-thinking and problem-solving exercise."

It engages them with a fun objective, capturing their attention. It also helps them start thinking categorically and logically, using reason to arrive at an answer. Further, it helps them develop a vocabulary centered on curiosity and answering questions, which makes it a valuable learning tool for any student, regardless of learning differences.
