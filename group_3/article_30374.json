Angina can be a sign of coronary heart disease (CHD), even if initial tests don't point to the disease. However, not all chest pain or discomfort is a sign of CHD. Panic attacks and other lung or heart conditions can also cause chest pain. Your doctor may ask about your symptoms, risk factors for heart disease, and your family history regarding CHD and other heart conditions.

How often you experience chest pain, where you feel pain or discomfort, the severity of the pain and how long the pain lasts. Dietary changes or foods you ate two to three days prior to experiencing chest pain or indigestion. Also note any beverages such as coffee, tea, and soda, and how frequently you drink them per day or per week. New exercise regimes or recreational activities that cause physical exertion.

It usually occurs after stress or physical activity and may last one to 15 minutes. Stable angina isn’t a heart attack, but suggests that a heart attack is more likely to occur in the future. If you have stable angina, you can learn its pattern and predict when the pain will occur. The pain usually goes away a few minutes after you rest or take your angina medicine (usually nitroglycerin, taken sublingually or under the tongue). Variant angina: Variant angina is rare. A spasm in a coronary artery causes this type of angina. Variant angina usually occurs while you're at rest, and the pain can be severe. It usually happens between midnight and early morning. Smoking is a major risk factor for this type of angina. Medicine can relieve this type of angina. Unstable angina: Unstable angina doesn’t follow a pattern and it may occur more often and be more severe than stable angina. It often occurs while the person is at rest. This type is very dangerous as it suggests that a heart attack may happen soon and requires emergency treatment. Unstable angina also can occur with or without physical exertion — it often happens without physical activity. Rest or medicine may not relieve the pain. Microvascular angina: Microvascular angina can be more severe and last longer than other types of angina. It is often noticed during routine activities and times of psychological stress. Symptoms include shortness of breath, sleep problems, fatigue and lack of energy. Medicine may not relieve this type of angina."

[5] X Expert Source Shervin Eshaghian, MD Board Certified Cardiologist Expert Interview. 26 June 2020. If you experience angina pain or palpitations, an electrocardiogram is usually the first test to determine if you have heart disease. An ECG is a test that records the electrical activity of the heart to measure any damage to the heart, heart rate, size and position of heart chambers. It also measures the effects of drugs or devices you may be using to manage chest pain. In addition, an ECG can be used to monitor stress levels. The procedure for ECG is painless, done by attaching patches called electrodes to your arms, legs or chest to monitor heart activity.

Other ways you can make sure you get enough sleep include: [10] X Trustworthy Source Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Main public health institute for the US, run by the Dept. of Health and Human Services Go to source Avoid caffeine, nicotine, alcohol and sugary drinks four to six hours before sleeping. These can act as a stimulant to keep you awake. A quiet, dark, and cool environment can help promote sleep. Use heavy curtains or an eye mask to block light. Light is a powerful cue that tells the brain that it's time to wake up. Keep the temperature comfortably cool (between 65 and 75°F or 18.3 to 23.9°C), and keep the room well ventilated. Make sure your bedroom is equipped with a comfortable mattress and pillows. Change your sheets and pillow covers often. If you have trouble breathing, try to prop your head up on a pillow to improve air flow. Struggling to fall asleep just leads to frustration. If you’re not asleep after 20 minutes, get out of bed, go to another room and do something relaxing until you are tired enough to sleep. Avoid activities such as work or exercise three to four hours prior to sleeping. Physically and psychologically stressful activities can cause the body to secrete the stress hormone cortisol, which is associated with increasing alertness. Try listening to relaxing music or doing some light reading a few hours before sleeping. Having a regular sleep schedule helps to ensure better quality and consistent sleep. Try to set a routine by going to bed early and waking up early to set your body’s internal clock. If you have congestive heart failure in addition to angina you may need to elevate the bed with pillows when you sleep so that your head is above your heart."

Studies show that regular exercise is beneficial for individuals with stable angina as it helps regulate high blood pressure, cholesterol, diabetes and obesity. Aerobic exercise, in particular, increases blood and oxygen flow to the heart while at rest and when you're doing everyday things like climbing stairs or carrying groceries. It also helps reduce the body’s production of stress hormones and has a positive impact on psychological health.

Ask for specific program recommendations to improve cardiovascular fitness, increase muscle strength and endurance, and improve range of motion. An extended warm-up and cool-down may reduce the risk of angina or other cardiovascular complications following exercise. Warming up and cooling down are important parts of every exercise routine. They help the body make the transition from rest to activity and back again, and can help prevent soreness or injury, especially in older people. Choose low-impact activities such as walking, cycling or water exercises, which involve large muscles groups and can be done continuously. If your fitness level is low, start with shorter sessions (10 to 15 minutes) and gradually build up to 30 minutes five or more days per week.

[17] X Research source , [18] X Research source Digital monitors are the best choice for most people. Practice using the monitor with your doctor or nurse to make sure you are taking your blood pressure correctly. A digital blood pressure monitor will not be as accurate if your body is moving when you are using it. Also, an irregular heart rate will make the reading less accurate. Your arm should be supported, with your upper arm at heart level and feet on the floor with your back supported and legs uncrossed. It's best to measure your blood pressure after you rest for at least five minutes. Blood pressure should not be checked right after experiencing stress, exercise, tobacco exposure, or consuming foods or beverages, such as coffee, that can raise blood pressure. If your blood pressure monitor shows a reading of more than 120/80 mmHg, you may have moderate hypertension. If it shows a reading higher than 140/90 mmHg, you may have high blood pressure and should tell your doctor.

A wire mesh tube called a stent is sometimes implanted to keep the artery wall expanded. The procedure can last for two to three hours. Ask your doctor if an angioplasty may help your condition."

      "content": "Consider EECP therapy. Enhanced external counterpulsation (EECP) therapy is a non-invasive procedure helpful for some people who have persistent angina. Large cuffs, similar to blood pressure cuffs, are put on your legs. The cuffs are inflated and deflated in sync with your heartbeat. EECP therapy improves the flow of oxygen-rich blood to your heart muscle and helps relieve angina. You typically receive 35 one-hour treatments over a period of seven weeks. EECP therapy can be performed by a licensed therapist or physician."

      "content": "Ask your doctor about medication. Talk with your doctor if you have any questions or concerns about taking your angina medicines. You should know what medicines you're taking, the purpose of each, how and when to take them, possible side effects and if they are safe to take with other medicines, herbs or foods. If you have side effects from your medication, let your doctor know. You should never stop taking your medication without your doctor's approval. Your doctor may prescribe medicine to treat CHD, high blood pressure, diabetes, or high cholesterol levels. These may include: Anti-platelet drugs, also called blood-thinners, such as aspirin. Take the baby strength (81 mg) aspirin or cut the regular strength (325mg) aspirin in half. Take one pill once a day with food. Studies have shown that taking aspirin decreases your risk of a cardiovascular disease. [45] X Research source Hennekens CH, Buring JE, Sandercock P, et al.

      "content": "Make an emergency action plan. Angina increases your risk for a heart attack. It’s important that you and your family know how and when to seek medical attention. Talk with your doctor about making an emergency action plan. Discuss your emergency plan with your family members. Take action quickly if your chest pain becomes severe, lasts longer than a few minutes, or isn't relieved by rest or medicine. The plan should include making sure you and your family members know: The signs and symptoms of a heart attack How to use medications when needed, such as nitroglycerin How to access emergency medical services in your community The location of the nearest hospital that offers 24-hour emergency heart care. Call 911 if you experience unstable angina, a heart attack, or loss of consciousness. You should also call 911 if the pain lasts longer than usual or if the pain returns a few minutes after taking medication."

      "title": "Take nitroglycerin for immediate relief.",
      "content": "Take nitroglycerin for immediate relief. Nitroglycerin is used to prevent chronic or stable angina. This medicine works by relaxing the blood vessels and increasing the supply of blood and oxygen to the heart. This medicine is also used to relieve an angina attack that is already occurring. When used regularly on a long-term basis, or just before exercise or a stressful event, this helps prevent angina attacks from occurring. Your doctor may prescribe nitroglycerin as a tablet, capsule or spray to help relieve angina pain. [46] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source This medicine should be used exactly as directed by your doctor. Do not take more than the prescribed dose, do not take it more frequently, and do not take it for a longer time than your doctor ordered. If you miss a dose of this medicine, take it as soon as possible. However, if it is almost time for your next dose, skip the missed dose and go back to your regular dosing schedule. Do not take double doses. When you begin to feel an attack of angina starting such as chest pains, tightness or squeezing in the chest, sit down. Use a nitroglycerin tablet or spray as directed by your doctor. You may become dizzy, lightheaded, or faint soon after using a tablet or spray, so it is safer to sit rather than stand while the medicine is working. If you become dizzy or faint while sitting, take several deep breaths and bend forward with your head between your knees. Remain calm and you should feel better in a few minutes. Nitroglycerin sublingual tablets usually give relief in one to five minutes. Nitroglycerin sublingual tablets should not be chewed, crushed, or swallowed. They work much faster when absorbed through the lining of the mouth. Place the tablet under the tongue or between the cheek and gum, and let it dissolve. Do not eat, drink, smoke, or use chewing tobacco while a tablet is dissolving. If the pain is not relieved, you may use a second tablet five minutes after you take the first tablet. If the pain continues for another five minutes, a third tablet may be used. Ask your doctor or nurse how to properly use a nitroglycerin oral spray if prescribed. You may administer one or two sprays of nitroglycerin oral spray at the onset of chest pain. If the pain continues after five minutes, a third spray may be used. You must wait five minutes after the first one or two sprays before using a third spray. If you still have chest pain after a total of three tablets or three sprays, contact your doctor or go to a hospital emergency room right away. Do not drive yourself and call 911 if necessary. Tell your doctor if you have any other respiratory or heart conditions. Also alert your doctor if you are using any other medications, supplements, herbal or home remedies, or if you experience an allergic reaction to nitroglycerin. Nitroglycerin should not be used for severe or unstable angina, during a heart attack, to treat low blood pressure or for people with anemia. Call 911 if you or someone with angina experiences a heart attack. Consult your doctor and see if nitroglycerin interacts with any of you current medication."
