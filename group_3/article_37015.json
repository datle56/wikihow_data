      "title": "Get polycarbonate plastic lenses for high UV protection.",
      "content": "Get polycarbonate plastic lenses for high UV protection. This material is light and durable, making it ideal for sunglasses that you plan to wear and use often. However, polycarbonate plastic lenses are not very scratch resistant, so you may want to get a scratch resistant coating on them for added protection. [1] X Research source Polycarbonate plastic and regular plastic lenses are the most popular types in high quality sunglasses."

      "title": "Opt for a scratch-resistant coating on the lenses to protect them.",
      "content": "Opt for a scratch-resistant coating on the lenses to protect them. You should be able to order most sunglass lenses with a coating that prevents scratching and other surface damage. Some lenses will come with this coating, while others will cost a bit more for this option. [2] X Research source The coating should be invisible and not affect how the lenses look or appear."
    },
    {
      "title": "Get glass lenses for high scratch resistance and low UV protection.",
      "content": "Get glass lenses for high scratch resistance and low UV protection. Glass lenses can be heavy and fragile, so they are not ideal for sunglasses you plan to wear often. However, they are less prone to scratching than plastic lenses. They have low UV protection so you may want to get a UV coating added to the glass lenses to protect your eyes from the sun. [3] X Research source Due to their fragile nature, glass lenses are not commonly used in sunglasses."

    {
      "title": "Go for polarized lenses to reduce glare.",
      "content": "Go for polarized lenses to reduce glare. Polarized lenses will absorb sunlight to reduce or prevent glare when you wear the sunglasses. This is a good option if you plan to wear the sunglasses often, especially in sunny or bright conditions. [4] X Research source Keep in mind getting the lenses mirrored, rather than polarized, will reduce some of the light that hits the lens but will not significantly reduce glare."
    },
    {
      "title": "Get tinted or colored lenses for style and appearance.",
      "content": "Get tinted or colored lenses for style and appearance. Standard tinted lenses and gradient tinted lenses are more of a fashion preference, as they do not do much to reduce glare or improve the lenses. You may also opt for colored lenses, such as yellow, gray, or green lenses, to add style to the glasses. [5] X Research source If you plan to wear the sunglasses when you are driving, go for grey or green colored lenses. Avoid brown and amber colored lenses, as they can affect your ability to differentiate color on street signs and stop lights when you are driving."

    {
      "title": "Look for the model number of the lenses on the frame.",
      "content": "Look for the model number of the lenses on the frame. The model number will help you match the replacement lenses with the ones currently in your sunglasses. It will usually appear on the inside of 1 of the temple pieces, which are the bars, or arms, of the sunglasses. The model number will have a mix of letters and numbers. [6] X Research source For example, you may have a model number like “SR 4550” or “6051-HJ.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "Check the color code of the lenses next to the model number.",
      "content": "Check the color code of the lenses next to the model number. The color code will have 1 number for the lens color or 2 numbers, 1 for the color of the frame and 1 for the color the lenses. The color code usually appears right after the model number on 1 of the temple pieces. [7] X Research source For example, you may have a color code like, “004” or a combination of 2 numbers, “402/14,” with the latter number being the color of the lenses."

    {
      "title": "Find the size of the lenses on the bridge of the frame.",
      "content": "Find the size of the lenses on the bridge of the frame. The size of the lense is usually in millimeters or centimeters. There will be 2 measurements, the width of the lenses and then the bridge and earpiece length. The width of the lenses is what you need to order the correct size lenses for the sunglasses. [8] X Research source For example, you may have a lens size like “50 to 75 millimetres (5.0 to 7.5 cm).”"

      "title": "Order the replacement lenses online or at your nearest sunglasses retailer.",
      "content": "Order the replacement lenses online or at your nearest sunglasses retailer. Once you have the model number, color code, and lenses size, you can order the replacement lenses from an online retailer. You can also choose other details like the lens material, the color or tint, and polarization. If you prefer to shop for the lenses in person, head to your nearest eyeglass or sunglass retailer and ask a salesperson to help you find the right replacement lenses for your sunglasses."

      "content": "Use a small screwdriver for glasses to remove the screws. Place the frames face down on a flat, soft surface. Use the screwdriver to remove the screws on either side of the frames and place them in a piece of fabric or in a block of foam so they do not roll away. Then, take out the old lenses by sliding them out from the frame. [9] X Research source You can get a tiny screwdriver for eyeglasses from an eyeglass repair kit or buy 1 at your local eyeglass store. The eyeglass repair kit usually comes with extra screws so you have replacements if you lose 1."

If the lens does not pop out easily, you can try using 1 hand to lift the top area of the frame and the other hand to pull the bottom area of the frame downward as you push out the lens. This should help it to pop out. [15] X Research source Repeat the same steps with the other lens so both of the old lenses are removed."
