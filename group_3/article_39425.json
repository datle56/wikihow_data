If you both enjoyed the date and want to see each other again, kissing is a great way to see if the physical chemistry is there. Everyone is different, though, so if you don’t want to kiss on the first date, you don’t have to! The important thing is to do what feels right for you, your date, and your budding relationship. [1] X Research source If you’re not sure if you like your date romantically, don’t pressure yourself into kissing them. It’s totally okay to go on a few more dates to see if you feel that spark. Relationship expert Maya Diamond says, “Only kiss if you genuinely want to kiss the person. If they try to kiss you, say, ‘I would love to, but I'm not ready for that yet’. Delay it to the second, third, or fourth date, or whenever you feel comfortable. Pay attention to what your true genuine desire is.” Relationship expert Lauren Sanders believes a kiss means your date wants to continue the relationship. She says, “If they feel comfortable enough to exchange saliva, get in your personal space, and allow you to get in their personal space, as well, they definitely can see a potential future with you.” She does add that some people are just “touchy-feely” and that their love language could be physical touch."

If you’re both up for it, kissing can help you decide if you have physical chemistry and if it’s worth pursuing a romantic relationship or better to stay friends. A kiss doesn’t have to mean you want to take the relationship to the next level, so don’t stress and allow yourself to enjoy the moment. [2] X Research source"

Simply let your date know you had a good time and if they try to kiss you, politely tell them you’re not interested . [8] X Research source If you decide you want to just be friends, Sanders says to be upfront about your intention. “First, offer a positive comment about your connection with them. The next step is to be 100% transparent about not wanting a relationship with them,” she says. “Reassure them that they are not to blame and they didn't necessarily do anything wrong. It's simply a matter of a lack of chemistry and connection present.”"

That's a direct point where you’re saying, ‘Hey, I'm interested in holding your hand because I may be interested in dating you.’ See how they respond.
