      "content": "Read the syllabus. At the beginning of any term, teachers or professors will usually hand out a syllabus with the assignments and expectations for a class. Make sure you read the syllabus carefully to know exactly what you need to do to pass the course. Make sure to pay attention to the breakdown of how assignments, attendance, and exams factor in to your grade. This will help you prioritize how much you need to study, and where to focus your attention. If you have any questions on the syllabus, ask the professor. It’s much better to ask a question at the beginning than plow on with no idea of what you’re doing."

      "content": "Attend class regularly. You cannot successfully pass a class or exams if you do not attend the class. This will allow you to hear vital lectures and take notes, as well as help you understand your readings and assignments. [1] X Trustworthy Source Association for Psychological Science Nonprofit organization devoted promoting trustworthy research and education in the psychological sciences Go to source Most exams are based on what is covered in class, so skipping class is never advisable. Some teachers will penalize absences, meaning you might not even pass the class if you skip. Teachers and professors usually discuss what is likely to be on an exam during classes, so if you aren’t in class you can’t get this crucial information. If you cannot attend class, let your professor know in advance. Ask her what you will miss in class and if there is anything you can do to make up for the absence and get the information. Don’t ask your teacher or professor questions like “Did I miss anything in class yesterday?” The assumption is that all days give you valuable information, and questions like this come across as disrespectful of your teacher. Don’t “zone out.” Sometimes, it’s tempting to play solitaire or check your phone during class instead of listening, especially if you’re in a class you feel you understand pretty well. However, you might miss something important if you do this. Stay attentive for the whole class period. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Take notes",
      "content": "Take notes . Lectures and discussions are a key component to a class and contain information you will need to pass the exams. By paying attention and taking notes throughout the term, you will have a built in study aid that will help you effectively study without scrambling for additional information. [3] X Research source Come prepared. Use a binder or notebook, and bring pens or pencils to class. If you will be discussing things from a book, bring a highlighter too. Teachers will often say things like, “This passage is very significant for understanding ____ in general” or “Make sure you understand the information in this sidebar.” If your teacher notes something specific in class, mark it immediately. [4] X Research source Taking notes is a delicate balancing act between getting too little and too much information. You don’t want to write down everything a professor says, just the important information. For example, it’s less important to know what type of planes bombed Dresden in February of 1945 than why the bombing was significant for World War II. Try using keywords instead of trying to copy out full sentences. Trying to take dictation from your professor could mean you don’t get the essence of what’s really important. Try using key phrases and words instead of full sentences. Take notes by hand. Studies have shown that people learn more by writing notes instead of typing them in to a computer or recording them on a device. [5] X Research source Check out some note-taking systems. There are a bunch of systems for learning how to take notes. Cal Poly has information on several types, along with their pros and cons."

By doing the reading assignments, you will not only be able to participate in class discussions, but will also have the information you need to pass the exam. Make sure to take notes on the reading assignment as you read. Just like taking notes from lectures, you only need to write down the most important information. [6] X Research source Skim back over your reading assignments every few weeks. You don’t have to go through everything in-depth, but going back over the main points will help them “gel” in your memory, so you can access them later on the exam."

They may even serve as practice for exam questions. The material you use and produce for any type of assignment may show up on an exam. Everything from math or scientific problems to short essays will help you be prepared and pass an exam. Participating in class discussions will also help you pass an exam because it gives you a chance to verbalize and work out your thoughts with other students and the professor. Don't save your assignments until the last minute or you'll feel stressed and have to rush through them.

If you keep this information in mind, it will help you know how much time you need to devote to studying for an exam. If you aren’t sure what your grade is, check your syllabus. Most teachers give “weights” to assignments and other course elements (participation, etc.). You should be able to get a rough idea of how you’re doing from this.

Some will make an exam comprehensive, while others will only test on a certain section of the material covered in class. Some exams are essay-based while others are multiple choice. Finding out what information the exam will cover and its format can help you study more effectively. Check to see if this information is on the class syllabus. Paying attention in class will also help, since most teachers and professors will announce what material the exam will cover. If you are not sure or missed a day of class, you can ask your teacher or professor, but it’s important to not annoy them with repeated or overly detailed requests. Simply asking “could you please tell me what material I need to know for the exam?” is enough to direct your study time.
