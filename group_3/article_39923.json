Ask questions that relate to your own hobbies and experiences. When you find something you both have in common, branch off that. Wrap things up when the conversation lulls. Don't feel like you need to stick around or have a long conversation.

      "content": "Match the tone of your response to the situation. While small talk isn’t rocket science, it’s still important to know who you’re talking to and when. For instance, how you chat with a friend is likely different to how you talk to your boss. The same rules apply with small talk. Ensure your answer is appropriate for the given situation. For example, in a job interview, you likely won’t gush about your favorite music the same way you would with a friend or crush as you want to remain professional and business-like."
