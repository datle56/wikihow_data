      "content": "Empty the bag completely to get rid of whatever's causing the smell. You won't be able to completely remove smells from the purse until you get rid of the smell's source. Take everything out of your purse so you can completely clean it. [1] X Research source For example, you might find that a cigarette broke inside your purse and tobacco is spilling out or a travel-size perfume is leaking."

      "content": "Use a vacuum attachment to suck up dirt and debris. You'll probably find scraps of paper, crumbs, or dust in the corners of the purse's liner. Take a long, narrow vacuum attachment and vacuum the interior of the purse. [2] X Research source Getting rid of the debris also makes it easier to wipe down the interior of the bag."

      "title": "Wipe down the inside and outside of the bag with diluted vinegar.",
      "content": "Wipe down the inside and outside of the bag with diluted vinegar. In general, you can safely remove most surface dirt with a simple solution of equal parts water and vinegar. Spritz this onto a cloth and then wipe the damp cloth over the entire bag. [3] X Research source Although the bag might smell like vinegar at first, the smell disappears as it dries. The vinegar may even remove faint smells from the purse. If you're worried about vinegar being too harsh, try dampening a microfiber cloth and adding a drop of dish soap."

      "title": "Pour a 1 pound (454 g) box of baking soda into a pillowcase.",
      "content": "Pour a 1 pound (454 g) box of baking soda into a pillowcase. Baking soda is a great natural deodorizer that you probably already have in your cupboard. Take an old pillowcase and open it. Then, pour the baking soda directly into the case and tie it closed. [4] X Research source If you don't want to pour out the baking soda, open the box and place it directly into the bag. Keep in mind that the box won't absorb the odors as quickly as if you would pour it into the pillowcase."

    {
      "title": "Place the pillowcase inside the purse.",
      "content": "Place the pillowcase inside the purse. Nestle the pillowcase with baking soda into the purse and don't seal the purse shut. If you just placed the box of baking soda into the purse, ensure that you don't tip it over. Don't worry if you accidentally spill the baking soda. You can easily vacuum it up with your attachment."

    {
      "title": "Keep the baking soda in the purse for at least 1 day.",
      "content": "Keep the baking soda in the purse for at least 1 day. If your purse doesn't have strong odors, the baking soda should remove most of them within a day or 2. For musty or overpowering smells, leave the baking soda in the purse until the smells are gone. This can take several months. If you keep the baking soda in the purse for a long time, remember to swap out the baking soda with a fresh box every 30 days. If you used activated charcoal, you can switch them every 2 months."

      "title": "Air out your bag for a day.",
      "content": "Air out your bag for a day. If your purse is just a little musty or slightly smelly, fresh air can do wonders for it. Take everything out of the bag and open it completely. Set it outside so fresh air can pass through it and lift away the bad scents. [5] X Research source If it looks like it might rain, bring the bag inside so it doesn't get wet."

      "title": "Tuck a few silica gel packets in the purse to absorb odors.",
      "content": "Tuck a few silica gel packets in the purse to absorb odors. The next time you find small silica packets in a package, don't throw them away. Place 3 or 4 of them in your purse to neutralize smells and absorb moisture. This is a great solution if your purse smells moldy since the silica gel gets rid of the moisture that causes mildew. [6] X Research source If you don't have silica gel packets, try scented dryer sheets. Although these won't remove the smells, they'll mask the bad odor for a while."

      "content": "Spay an odor-removing product inside the purse. For a temporary fix, spritz the inside of the bag with an odor-eliminating spray. The spray usually masks obnoxious smells but doesn't completely remove them. [7] X Research source You can use scented or fragrance-free odor eliminating spray."

      "title": "Place a solid odor-absorber inside the bag and leave it for a few days.",
      "content": "Place a solid odor-absorber inside the bag and leave it for a few days. To keep stinky smells at bay, buy a small odor-absorbing puck and put it in the bag a few days before you plan to use it. Most odor-absorbing pucks absorb moisture and neutralize bad smells. [8] X Research source You can buy odor-absorbing pucks at home improvement stores or online. To keep your bag scent-free, put the odor-absorber into the bag every night. Then, take it out in the morning before you use the bag for the day."
