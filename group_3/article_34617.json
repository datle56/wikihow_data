You may notice branches or leaves extending out from the top or sides of the tree. This means it’s time to prune the tree to reshape it and encourage healthy growth.

      "content": "Use sharp gardening shears . Look for gardening shears at your local gardening supply store or online. The shears should be clean and sharp so you can trim the tree properly. [4] X Research source Do not use shears that have already been used on plants that have any diseases or pests, as they can then transfer to the tree. Clean the shears with water or use a different pair of shears just for the money tree."

      "content": "Find two branches that form a V-shape off the trunk. Look for two branches that extend out from the trunk of the tree to form a V-shape. Place your finger above the V-shape to mark it so you know where to cut. Pruning the tree at the V-shape will ensure the tree maintains its shape and growth."

      "content": "Trim the tree down to no more than half its size. Err on the side of caution and trim the tree a little at a time. Remove a few overgrown branches and any brown leaves. Then, step back and look over the shape of the tree. If the tree still looks uneven in shape, trim off more branches until it looks more uniform. [5] X Research source Do not remove too many branches or leaves, as this can stunt the growth of the tree. Remove a little at a time, rather than a lot of the tree at once."

Use a watering can or jug with a long neck to get to the roots of the plant, as getting water on the stem or leaves can cause rot and attract pests to the tree. Only water the tree’s roots when the soil feels dry, as you do not want to overwater the tree. [7] X Research source Chai Saechao. Plant Specialist. Personal interview. 20 February 2020.

Remove the tree and the soil from the pot. Use clean gardening shears to prune back 1/4 of the roots. Then, place the tree in a new pot with drainage holes or gravel and fresh soil. [8] X Research source Water the money tree well after you repot it to encourage growth. You can submerge the entire pot in a tub of water or use a watering can to water the roots well."
