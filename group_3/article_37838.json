[1] X Research source Living on the streets is difficult, and nature will not provide you with blankets when you are cold or food when you are hungry. If you are being abused or neglected, the safest solution is to call Children's Aid or the police before trying to run away . Some teens, especially those with troubled families, think that foster care is worse than running away. Whatever your experience may be, the majority of foster parents truly care about the health and well-being of their foster children."

You will be separated from the places you are familiar with and the people who know and support you, and you will be completely responsible for satisfying all your basic needs.

[3] X Research source You may feel like running away is your only solution, but this kind of thinking is never accurate. [4] X Research source There are always many solutions to a problem, and running away should be a last resort. As a teen, it will be difficult for you to make money to pay for food and shelter. Unfortunately, because of this reason, around 1 in 3 teens who run away resort to trading sexual favors for food or a place to stay. [5] X Research source This will put you at risk for sexually transmitted diseases, sexual abuse, and/or manipulation."

As a teen runaway, many other homeless people will be bigger and stronger than you, and if you need to escape, you need to do so quickly, without being bogged down by creature comforts. Only pack necessities. Take as much cash as you are able, but be wary of credit or debit cards, which can be tracked. Pack for your destination. If you are heading somewhere cold, your greatest concern should be keeping warm . Keep in mind that arid climates, like the desert, get very cold after dark. A lightweight thermal blanket could save your life."

      "content": "Choose to run to a safe location. Staying in a forest, park, or nature preserve is not recommended. All it takes is a bad step and you may be stranded with a broken ankle far from medical help. If you want to live in the country, be sure to travel along main routes where you can flag down help if needed. If you live in a city or are running to an urban area, try to find a shelter. If you don't have any safe options, try to rest in a busy place during the day. Sleep on a blanket in the park or at the beach during the day. This will make you look less suspicious and more like a normal person taking a nap. A location with public transportation is a good choice, as it is cheaper and faster than other options. A bicycle can be useful, but its weight and safety can be a bigger hassle than help. Bridges offer protection from the elements and the cement will hold warmth from the day through the night. Beware of others if you attempt sleeping under a bridge; these are popular locations for other homeless people. If you chose to go to a homeless shelter, you must be prepared to answer questions when you arrive. A friend or a relative's house should be considered but will come with its own rules. You will always have to respect the homes of others."

For example, you may want to call into school sick and leave on your way, or you might consider leaving right after everyone is in bed. This will give you a few hours to put distance between you and the place you are running from. Try to make it as far away as possible before stopping to rest. To make yourself more difficult to find, you should try to get out of town, and eventually, your state. [13] X Research source The train or a bus can take you a great distance for a small cost. Wear a cap with a brim or a hood so that your face is covered and you do not show up on security footage. To make yourself less noticeable, dye your hair a common color that's different from your natural shade and/or cut your hair. Be sure your new haircut/dye job doesn't look sloppy; some might question your appearance if you aren't careful. Take clothes you rarely or never wear. You can always purchase new clothing cheap from a thrift store so you aren't wearing anything that can identify you."

      "content": "Always put food first. This is your top priority. You can fill up a bottle of water at nearly any sink, but beware labels that say \"Not Potable\", as this means the water isn't intended for drinking. Take all food you find (but make sure it is good to eat) and all food offered to you, and be sure to eat it before it goes bad, even if you aren't hungry. However, never take food from someplace or someone that doesn't look or isn't reputable or trustworthy. If someone or someplace looks suspicious, or if food smells or looks suspicious, take the food, but when the person leaves, toss it away. Don't refuse it or toss it away in their sight because they might hurt you if you do so. Trust your instincts. If something doesn't feel right, it probably isn't. For example, if you are given some spinach and you feel a sick feeling in your stomach as you look at it, do not eat it. Or if someone or someplace looks reputable or safe, but you feel suspicious, don't eat the offered gift. Some people can and will give you poisoned food and drinks. Never, under any circumstances, drink any liquids offered to you. They may be spiked or contain poison. Only drink water from water fountains where the water is good to drink."

Stay away from dangerous places where robbers or rapists could be lurking, which includes alleys or secluded areas of parks. Although cleanliness is important, try to look as sexually unappealing as you can to protect yourself from predators. Dress like you are going to school or an informal church event, not like you are going to a party. Clothing with lots of pockets will provide you with places to keep the necessary supplies."

The person may wait until you are vulnerable before asking you to go farther than you are comfortable. Your money will be necessary to pay for things you need to survive; do not waste any of your limited cash on alcohol, drugs, or cigarettes. Although other runaways/homeless may abuse drugs or alcohol, and may even offer you some, always refuse the offer. It will be difficult for you to defend yourself when drunk, high, or incapacitated."

Keep your tool well hidden but within reach at all times. Money should be kept in your underwear, not in socks or bras, which is where many people first look. [14] X Research source If someone says, \"I saw you with money last night,\" say that it's all gone, even if you still have some. Keep a spare, visible bag or purse with a few dollars and coins. This way, if you're robbed, they'll take this instead. [15] X Research source If you run out of money for food, be careful when begging. This will draw attention, and in some cases, upset other homeless. It is also illegal to beg for money in some places. A supermarket that offers free samples is a great place you can find food without drawing attention to yourself. If someone asks, you can always say you're waiting for your mom."
