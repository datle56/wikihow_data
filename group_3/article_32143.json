      "title": "Find a well-ventilated space.",
      "content": "Find a well-ventilated space. You don’t want the chemicals from your paint to get into your lungs, so make sure the air in your painting area is circulating well. Try opening 2 windows across from each other to create a vacuum effect."

      "title": "Cover your working area with newspaper.",
      "content": "Cover your working area with newspaper. So you don’t make a mess, lay down a few layers of newspaper where you’re going to work. [1] X Research source If you don't have any newspaper, you can use plastic sheeting or painter's drop cloth instead. You could also work outdoors."

      "content": "Make a priming paste of 1:1 wood glue and water. In a bowl, combine 1 part water to 1 part wood glue with a disposable stirring stick (like a wooden chopstick or disposable cutlery) until it’s thick and not watery. The priming paste should have a jelly-like consistency."
    },
    {
      "title": "Apply the paste with a paint brush, then let it dry until it turns clear.",
      "content": "Apply the paste with a paint brush, then let it dry until it turns clear. Use a paint brush to apply the paste to the foam, covering the surface of the foam. Use long, even strokes to completely cover the surface. All the strokes should be in the same direction to create an even base for the paint to adhere to. Then, allow the paste to dry until it turns clear. The size of the paint brush will depend on the size of your foam project. If you have a very large project, use a 4.5 in (11 cm) brush, while if your project is small and intricate, you'll be better off with a 1.5 in (3.8 cm) brush. If the paste creates unsightly marks on the foam, wet your finger with water and brush them out before the paste dries. Depending on the temperature, drying could take up to 24 hours. Make sure that the paste has turned completely clear before you start painting."

      "title": "Get an artist paint brush for small decorations.",
      "content": "Get an artist paint brush for small decorations. If you’re doing small, intricate designs on your foam, use a paint brush. Small artist paint brushes are great if you need control when decorating your foam project. [3] X Research source These paint brushes are around 5–10 in (13–25 cm) long, and you can get them from an art store or general store for around $2 (£1.42). Many general stores also sell sets of them for around $5 (£3.55). For detailed work and thin lines, choose a “round” tip brush. For thick, heavy color and short strokes, use a “bright” tip brush. For filling wide spaces, try a “flat” brush. For filling corners, an “angular flat” brush is best."

      "content": "Put water-based acrylic paint in a flat palette. Choose the colors you’d like and squeeze them onto a flat palette. Keep them separate for now, but leave a small area in the middle of the palette for mixing colors. Water-based acrylic paint will dry faster than other methods, making it easier for you to apply multiple layers of paint on your foam."

      "content": "Use a dry brush to paint your foam project. Dip your dry paint brush into the paint and paint the foam. Don't be worried if the paint seeps into the foam, leaving white space; you'll follow up with another coat later. Dip your brush into a cup of water and swirl it around before switching colors. Dry it off with a paper towel before choosing a new color."

[4] X Research source If you don't let your foam dry before applying another coat, your paint brush may just move the old paint around instead of applying the new paint."

      "content": "Apply 2-3 coats of paint until the paint no longer sinks into the foam. Reapply paint in the same manner as before until you can't see white spots through the paint. Applying multiple coats will help the paint penetrate the porous surface of the foam."

      "content": "Allow your foam project to dry for at least an hour. Acrylics dry quickly, but you should still give your project at least an hour before handling it with bare hands. [5] X Research source Turning up the heat in your working area will help the drying process go faster."

Use a natural sea sponge (sponges harvested from the sea) for an interesting, multi-layered effect, similar to the look of granite (but with any color you choose). You can find natural sponges for around $10 (£7.10) at a hardware store. [7] X Research source Natural sea sponges often come in sizes of 5–6 in (13–15 cm). You can use a kitchen sponge, but it won't look quite the same."

      "content": "Dip the sponge into the paint, then blot some onto the newspaper. Choosing the paint you want to use, dip the sponge into it, blotting a little bit of paint off the sponge onto the newspaper so that you don’t make drips on your foam.

      "content": "Paint with a paint roller for large, flat projects. If your foam project is large and flat, you'll be better off with a paint roller of around 9 in (23 cm), which can cover a high amount of space in a short time. A paint roller that's 9 in (23 cm) will cost around $7 (£4.95) at a hardware store. You'll also need a foam cover, which will cost around $5 (£3.55), and a paint tray, which will cost around $2 (£1.42)."

Pour the paint slowly into the tray and fill up the small basin, making sure you’ve left the screen (the ridged, tilted area inside the tray) free of paint. [11] X Research source You’ll be using this screen to scrape excess paint off of your roller, so make sure you haven’t filled it with paint. Latex paint will be the easiest to apply with a roller, and you can get 1 US gal (3.8 l) of it for about $20 (£14.12) at a hardware store."

Slide the foam cover onto the paint roller and spin it several times to make sure that it will roll upon the surface you’re painting.

Dip your paint roller about 1 ⁄ 2 in (1.3 cm) into the paint, then roll it back and forth 2-3 times against the screen.

Once that’s done, roll the roller up and down the length of the project until the paint is smooth and covers the foam.
