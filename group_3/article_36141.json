      "content": "Apply white vinegar to the sticker for an at-home fix. You can dip a paper towel in white vinegar and saturate the bumper sticker with it, or you can pour white vinegar in a spray bottle and spray the bumper sticker with the liquid. Make sure the sticker is adequately covered with the vinegar before letting it sit. [1] X Research source You can also apply the white vinegar using a paintbrush."

      "title": "Spray WD-40 on the bumper sticker to remove the edges easily.",
      "content": "Spray WD-40 on the bumper sticker to remove the edges easily. After reading the instructions on the can, aim the spray at each of the bumper sticker's edges, spraying the recommended amount. This will loosen up the edges enough to make removing the sticker much easier. [2] X Research source Though you can use WD-40 in addition to white vinegar if the vinegar didn't work well, WD-40 is primarily used as an alternative to other adhesive removers."

      "content": "Use an adhesive remover spray for trickier bumper stickers. You can find an adhesive remover spray from your local big box store or hardware store that's specifically designed to help take off pesky adhesives. Read the instructions to find out how much to spray on the bumper sticker, and feel free to use the spray several times if needed. [3] X Research source Goo Gone is a popular option for adhesive removers that works well on bumper stickers."

      "title": "Let the adhesive remover sit for roughly five minutes.",
      "content": "Let the adhesive remover sit for roughly five minutes. Once the bumper sticker is saturated with your chosen adhesive remover, set a timer for five minutes to allow the remover to seep into the sticker’s adhesive. If you’re using a specific type of adhesive remover, look at the directions to make sure you wait the proper amount of time. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Peel away the sticker using a plastic putty knife or your fingers.",
      "content": "Peel away the sticker using a plastic putty knife or your fingers. After the adhesive remover works its way into the sticker, start removing the sticker by lifting up a corner and pulling it off slowly. If you find that the sticker isn’t coming up easily, apply more of your chosen adhesive remover and let it sit for a few minutes before trying again. [5] X Research source Use an old credit card instead of a plastic putty knife, if desired. Spray specific stuck spots to help loosen them up."

      "title": "Wipe away any extra residue using rubbing alcohol.",
      "content": "Wipe away any extra residue using rubbing alcohol. Dampen a microfiber towel or old cloth with rubbing alcohol and gently wipe off any sticky spots left from your sticker removal. The alcohol should take away any residue that's left, leaving you with a clean surface."

      "title": "Wipe the bumper sticker with a clean cloth to remove surface dirt.",
      "content": "Wipe the bumper sticker with a clean cloth to remove surface dirt. The cloth can be dry or damp depending on how much dirt you're trying to remove and how long it's been there. Removing dirt and grime from the bumper sticker will let the heat source penetrate faster. [6] X Research source If you're using a damp rag, dip it in lukewarm water before wringing it out to remove excess water."

      "title": "Blow hot air onto the bumper sticker for a quick fix.",
      "content": "Blow hot air onto the bumper sticker for a quick fix. A hair dryer is the easiest heat tool to use, though you can also use a heat gun. Put the hair dryer on the hottest setting and hold it roughly 6 inches (15 cm) from the bumper sticker, heating up the middle section of the sticker before the edges. Move the hair dryer back and forth instead of keeping it in one place to avoid damaging the surface. [7] X Research source Holding the hair dryer too close to the bumper sticker may cause the paint to melt. If you choose to use a heat gun (which is hotter than a hair dryer), hold it roughly 1 foot (0.30 m) away from the sticker for 1-3 seconds until the sticker bubbles slightly. Heat the bumper sticker using a hair dryer for about a minute—if you see the edges of the sticker starting to lift, it’s ready."

    {
      "title": "Apply steam to the sticker to loosen the adhesive gently.",
      "content": "Apply steam to the sticker to loosen the adhesive gently. If you have a clothes steamer, you can steam the bumper sticker for about 30 seconds to a minute. Hold the steamer 6 inches (15 cm) from the sticker to avoid damaging the surface. Move the steamer over each part of the sticker slowly, making sure all the edges are loose."

    {
      "title": "Pour boiled water over the sticker if you don’t have a heat tool.",
      "content": "Pour boiled water over the sticker if you don’t have a heat tool. Bring water to a boil on a stovetop or in the microwave, and carefully pour it directly over the bumper sticker to loosen the glue. Make sure you pour it over the edges of the bumper sticker as well as the middle to make peeling it off easier. [8] X Research source Though it will depend on the size of your bumper sticker, 2–3 cups (470–710 ml) of water should work well. You can also dip a rag in boiled water and hold the rag on the sticker for a few minutes, though it’s important to wear gloves or an oven mitt to ensure you don’t burn yourself."

      "title": "Use a credit card or plastic scraper to peel away the sticker.",
      "content": "Use a credit card or plastic scraper to peel away the sticker. Whether you used a hair dryer, steam, or boiled water to loosen the bumper sticker’s adhesive, the next step is slipping a plastic scraper tool under an edge of the sticker and scraping it off gently. Peel up the sticker slowly to make sure you don’t damage the surface, and apply more heat if necessary. [9] X Research source Plastic putty knives work well, and you can get them from any big box, home improvement, or art store. Don’t worry if the sticker rips while you’re peeling it off—just continue using your heat method and slowly scraping from the edges first. Continue using the scraper to peel up the sticker until it’s completely removed. Avoid pulling the bumper sticker directly up as you remove it to avoid damaging the surface."

      "title": "Clean off any residue using rubbing alcohol.",
      "content": "Clean off any residue using rubbing alcohol. If the sticker left some stickiness behind, dampen a microfiber towel with rubbing alcohol and wipe the spot with the towel. This should remove all the remnants of the bumper sticker, leaving the surface looking fresh and clean! You can also use a detailing spray or other car cleaner instead of rubbing alcohol if desired."
