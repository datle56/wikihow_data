      "title": "They usually bail on you last minute without an apology.",
      "content": "They usually bail on you last minute without an apology. Someone who cancels on you without any warning is someone who doesn’t truly value your friendship or time. It might seem like they’re always ready to jump at a better opportunity instead of spending time with you, and they likely give you barely any heads up before ditching your plans. For example, a friend who doesn’t value you might cancel your plans to go hang out with someone else. Or, they might just give vague excuses like, “I can’t today,” even though you’ve had those plans set for a while. If this happens repeatedly, have a direct conversation with them. Say something like, “I noticed you’ve been really busy lately, Is there something going on?” as a way to better understand their situation."

      "content": "They’re not someone you can rely on. A friend who doesn’t value you likely doesn’t feel too guilty breaking promises and might have even made a habit out of it. At some point, it might feel like you can’t depend on them when it comes to important matters. For example, they might have a history of not showing up to help you when they said they would, such as when you were moving or starting a new project. [1] X Trustworthy Source Simply Psychology Popular site for evidence-based psychology information Go to source They might have also broken promises around some of the boundaries you set. For example, even if they promised at first not to talk about a topic that’s sensitive to you, they might’ve still brought it up at some point. To deal with this kind of situation, ask them first what might’ve caused them to break their promise to get their side of the story. If they continue this behavior, establish some sort of consequence to show them that their actions are really hurting you. For example, you might decide to take a break from them for a while after they broke a promise."

      "content": "You’re likely the one always reaching out to them. If it feels like you’re the only one putting effort into your relationship, it’s likely that your friend doesn’t truly value your friendship. It might be that they also don’t text you or reach out that often, and you might only see and hear from them once in a while despite being their “friend.” [2] X Trustworthy Source Simply Psychology Popular site for evidence-based psychology information Go to source If you notice some of these patterns, take a moment to evaluate your friendship and ask yourself if your needs are being met. For example, you might desire a friendship with someone whom you can talk to often. If this friendship isn’t giving you that, it might be a sign that the connection between you and your friend isn’t the best or healthiest for you."

      "content": "They make insensitive comments and belittle you in front of others. A friend who doesn’t value you might act condescending toward you through the things they say, such as by saying “You’re so dumb” or “You’re so bad at that.” They also might use sarcasm with you a lot. Because of this, you might feel less confident around them or like you can’t be your true self with them. [3] X Research source To deal with a condescending friend, call them out on their behavior and have a discussion with them. Say something like, “You seem really critical of me lately” or “I’ve felt really hurt by some of the things you’ve said to me recently.”"

      "content": "They may interrupt you or even talk over you. A friend who doesn’t value you might not let you get a word in edgewise when talking to you. Instead, they might only talk about themselves and what’s going on in their life, and they rarely ask for your opinion. It might feel like they don’t value what you have to say or have any interest in what’s going on with your life. To deal with someone who talks too much , listen to them for a bit, but then politely interrupt them to make them aware that you have something to say. For example, say something like, “Are you finished? I’d like to say something.” If they try to interrupt you, assert yourself by saying, “I listened to you, so please give me a chance to say what I want to say.”"

      "content": "They always try to one-up your achievements. A true friend would be happy when you achieve something great and be there to celebrate with you. However, a friend who doesn’t truly value you might easily get jealous when you share good news with them. Instead of celebrating, they might try to make themselves the center of attention by bringing up their own achievements. [4] X Research source Even though it might feel like they’re trying to make everything a competition, avoid giving in to the urge to compete with them. Instead, focus on your achievements and encourage yourself by telling yourself things like, “I did well” and “I’m proud of myself.” Reader Poll: We asked 814 wikiHow readers what’s the strongest indicator someone doesn’t want to be your friend, and only 9% of them agreed that they aren’t happy when you achieve something. [Take Poll] It can definitely hurt when it feels like your friends don’t care about your achievements, but it’s possible they don’t realize what they’re doing. It’s best to talk to them about the situation before assuming the worst."

However, a friend who doesn’t value you may be slow to give you praise or show support for the things you do. Or, they might just give very lukewarm compliments, such as “That outfit doesn’t look too bad” or “You did alright, I guess.” [5] X Research source Use positive affirmations to build up your confidence if your friend isn’t there to help you. Tell yourself things like, “I like how I look” or “I’m doing really well.” Be honest with your friend and tell them how you feel when they make such comments. Say something like, “I feel like you’re not really excited for me and your words feel more like backhanded compliments to me.”"

If they expect you to be at their beck and call 24/7, it shows that they don’t really value you as a person with their own life and responsibilities. They might expect you to drop your plans whenever they want to go out, but they won’t make themselves available when you want to hang out. If they constantly expect you to be there for them, your friendship might feel more exhausting than fulfilling. [6] X Research source If you’re feeling exhausted by their constant requests for you to be there for them, set boundaries about how you want to spend your time. For example, tell them firmly that you need alone time to recharge. If they can’t respect that, tell them that you might need to take a break from them for a bit."

      "content": "They take advantage of your generosity but may not reciprocate it. A friend who doesn’t value you may not contact you often, but when they do, it’s usually only because they need you to do a favor for them. They might say something like, “I know it’s been a while, but I need your help with something.” They might simply expect you to drop everything to help them but likely won’t return the favor or really show you any gratitude for your help. Set clear boundaries and say no when their requests infringe on your own life or create inconveniences for you. Say something like, “I can’t help you this time” or make them promise to return the favor by saying, “I’ll help you so long as you help me with something else.”"

A friend who doesn’t value you can end up dominating your plans and likely doesn’t ask for your input. The way to deal with a friend like this is to be assertive . State your opinion even if they don’t directly ask you so that they’re forced to take your input into account."

      "content": "They might judge your aspirations or belittle your goals. Whereas a true friend will be there to encourage you to pursue your passions, a friend who doesn’t value you might make condescending comments about your future plans or dreams. Instead of lifting you up, they might criticize your choices or make you doubt yourself. [7] X Research source For example, they might say something like, “I don’t think you’ll be any good at that. Why don’t you try something more your speed?” Remind yourself that just because your friend doesn’t support your dreams doesn’t mean that your goals are any less valuable or important. If your friend’s criticism is having a negative impact on your confidence, take a break from them for a while or consider ending the friendship . You want to be surrounded by positive people who will make you feel good about yourself."

It might be that they don’t want you to hang out with their other friends, so they purposefully exclude you from plans. A true friend is someone who works to make you feel included and like you’re an important part of their life. [8] X Research source If your friend is ignoring you, deal with them by directly addressing the issue. Say, “I feel like you’ve been avoiding me these past few weeks. Did something happen?”"

When you and your friend are hanging out with a larger group, it might seem like they take on a whole new personality around their other friends. This might be a sign that they don’t feel as at ease around you when others are around. They might prioritize maintaining a certain reputation over being genuine with you, which can signal that they don’t truly value your friendship. [9] X Trustworthy Source Simply Psychology Popular site for evidence-based psychology information Go to source Talk to them about any changes you notice. Say something like, “I notice you act a bit differently around our friends. Is there something I might be doing to make you feel uncomfortable?” Make an effort to understand where they may be coming from.

      "content": "You feel like they can’t be trusted with your personal secrets. When your friend goes behind your back and talks about you or spills the secrets that you entrusted them with, it’s a clear sign that they don’t respect your privacy. It can feel like they’ve seriously betrayed your trust. A true friend is someone who shows you respect and maintains any boundaries you might have set. [10] X Research source A friend who doesn't respect you may also gossip about you or even spread rumors about you that aren’t true. To deal with a friend’s betrayal , call them out on their actions and be honest about your feelings. Say something like, “I felt really angry and betrayed after finding out that you told them my secret.” Decide whether you can forgive them or if you think you need to step away from the friendship if they’ve severely hurt you."

      "title": "They make excuses or try to blame other people.",
      "content": "They make excuses or try to blame other people. A friend who doesn’t value you is someone who doesn’t respect you by owning up to their actions. Instead, they’ll try to come up with excuses or put the blame on their situation or other people. For example, if they broke a promise, they might say something like, “I only acted like that because my job has been so stressful recently.” [11] X Research source They might also just lie about what happened or deny that they did anything wrong. Rather than taking responsibility, they might say something like, “I didn’t do that” or “That was totally someone else’s fault, not mine.” Someone who takes responsibility for their actions would say something like, “I messed up and there’s no excuse for my actions. I’m sorry I hurt you.” Use “I” language to express to them how their actions made you feel without making it sound like you’re accusing them. For example, instead of saying, “It was really terrible of you to forget your promise,” say, “I felt let down when you didn’t show up.”"

Instead of apologizing, they might just promise to buy you food or make a vague promise not to do whatever it is they did again. This can undoubtedly be frustrating, especially if you know that they were in the wrong. [12] X Research source While it may be hard, sometimes it’s best to forgive them in order to move on with your relationship. This doesn't mean forgetting what they did. Instead, it’s about letting go of your anger and not allowing it to hold you back. If they consistently fail to apologize for their mistakes, it might be best to put some distance between you and them for a while and give them the opportunity to self-reflect on their actions."

      "content": "They pressure you to break the rules even if you’re uncomfortable. It’s a red flag if your friend pressures you to do things you’re uncomfortable with or partake in risky activities. It shows that they don’t truly respect you or your boundaries. For example, they might try to convince you to drink or do drugs even though you’ve said no. [13] X Research source Be firm in maintaining your boundaries if your friend tries to get you to do something you’re uncomfortable with. Say no and establish some consequences if they don’t listen to you. For example, tell them that you won’t hang out with them for a few weeks if they continue their behavior."

A true friend is someone who takes the time to get to really know you, but a friend who doesn’t value your friendship may not bother to get to know about your life and interests. They might instead choose to just talk about themselves, or they may just gossip about other people instead of asking about you. Unfortunately, if it seems like they’re actively avoiding getting to know you, it might be that they don’t want to be friends with you. In this situation, you might try opening up to them , but if they aren’t receptive of your attempts, it might be in your best interest to let them go and find a friend who shows a genuine interest in you."

Despite the fact that you might always be there to support them when they’re having trouble, they might not be there to reciprocate the favor. If it seems like they’re always too busy to help or comfort you, it might mean that they don’t value your friendship and are taking your generosity for granted. [17] X Research source For example, they might just send a “Sorry that happened” text rather than taking the time to listen to you and try to offer you more heartfelt support and comfort. Communicate your needs directly to your friend to help them see where they may be lacking in giving you support. For example, tell them, “I’d appreciate it if I was able to call you when I want to talk about something.” Focus on finding ways to take care of yourself instead of solely relying on your friend for comfort.

They might also be a bit harsh in their delivery and tell you things like, “It’s not that bad. I don’t know why you’re getting so upset.” The most important thing is that you receive the support you need, and this might mean that you need to put some distance between yourself and your friend for a while.

If a friend gets jealous of the other relationships in your life or makes you feel like you’re “abandoning them” for other people, it might be a sign that they don’t truly value your friendship for what it is. Even if you make an effort to spend time with them, they might always feel like it’s not enough. [18] X Research source A true friend doesn’t try to guilt you into spending time with them and respects your other relationships.

Friends who don’t value you or respect your boundaries may have no problem with using manipulation to get you to do things the way they want. For example, they might gaslight you to make you feel guilty and take the blame for something. [19] X Research source Gaslighting is when someone makes you doubt yourself and your memories in order to manipulate you psychologically. For example, a friend who gaslights you might say something like, “You’re not remembering that. You know I’d never tell anyone your secrets, so why are you accusing me of that?” Or, they might use guilt to get you to spend more time with them, such as by saying, “Am I even your friend? You never make time for me.” Gaslighting is a sign of a toxic friendship. If you notice this happening, put some distance between you and them or stop contacting them altogether to end the friendship."
