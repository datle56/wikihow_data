You’ll be able to type the angle (in degrees) as well as the direction (clockwise or counter-clockwise). “Flip Canvas Horizontal”: Flips the entire image as if shown in a mirror (horizontally). “Flip Canvas Vertical”: Flips the entire image upside-down."

To hide other layers while working with the one(s) you’ve selected, click the icon that looks like an eye (visibility icon) next to the layer thumbnail. You can make it visible again later. If a layer you want to rotate/flip has a padlock icon to the right of its name, the layer is locked and cannot be modified.

Hover the mouse cursor outside of the top right corner of the bounding box until a “rotating arrow” (curved arrow with heads on each end) appears.
