      "content": "Turn the sharpener so the blade is facing up. Put the sharpener down on a flat, solid surface. Then, flip it so the blade part is facing up toward you. [1] X Research source Make sure the surface you’re working on is stable ( no wobbly tables!). If you slip, the blade could cut you."

      "title": "Get a Phillips head screwdriver that matches the screw on the blade.",
      "content": "Get a Phillips head screwdriver that matches the screw on the blade. Most pencil sharpeners use small Phillips head screws to attach the blades. Get a small Phillips head screwdriver and make sure it fits into the screw holding the blade down. You might have to try a few sizes before you find the right one. [2] X Research source Some sharpeners might use a flathead screw instead, so be ready to use one of these if you have to. If you have an eyeglass or instrument repair kit, the small screwdriver included in that kit might work. No screwdriver? No problem! Try a metal nail file, a butter knife, the hook of a pair of nail clippers, the prong of a watch buckle, the tip of the blade of a small pair of scissors, or maybe even a thin piece of plastic like the edge of a credit card."

      "content": "Remove the screw on the blade by turning it counterclockwise. Insert the screwdriver into the screw and turn it to the left (or counterclockwise). Keep turning until the screw comes out. [3] X Research source Sharpener blades usually have 1 or 2 screws, so remove all of the ones that you see. Keep track of the screws you take off so you can put the sharpener back together."

      "title": "Flip the sharpener upside down to pop the blade out.",
      "content": "Flip the sharpener upside down to pop the blade out. With the screws gone, the blade should come out easily. Turn the sharpener upside down so the blade falls out. You may have to give it a little shake. Hold the sharpener close to the table so the blade doesn’t bounce when it comes out. Do not try to dig the blade out with your finger. It’s sharp and you could easily cut yourself. If it’s stubborn, tap the sharpener on the table until it pops out."

      "title": "Repeat the process if there are multiple blades.",
      "content": "Repeat the process if there are multiple blades. Some sharpeners have multiple blades, so follow the same process for each one. Simply remove the screws and flip the sharpener so they fall out. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Pull the lid off of the body.",
      "content": "Pull the lid off of the body. Some pencil sharpeners have a canister or cup to catch pencil shavings. The lid, which holds the sharpener, sits on top of that body. It’s usually not attached, so simply lift it off the cup. If the cup has pencil shavings in it, be careful not to spill them everywhere. Dump them into a trash can."

      "title": "Remove the screws holding the sharpener to the lid.",
      "content": "Remove the screws holding the sharpener to the lid. Flip the lid upside down. There are typically screws underneath the lid holding the sharpener in place. Use a Phillips head screwdriver and remove all those screws. You can then pull the sharpener off of the lid. [5] X Research source Keep track of the screws you remove so you can put the sharpener back together. Different sharpeners might have a different number of screws. Most have two, but remove any additional screws that you see."

      "content": "Slide the sharpener out of its housing. The sharpener might be inside a plastic housing. If so, simply slide it out of the open side to reach the sharpener blades. [6] X Research source Not all sharpeners have a plastic housing, so you might not have to slide yours out."

      "content": "Take out the blades by removing the screws. Once you’ve taken apart the sharpener housing, you can reach the blades. Unscrew these if you want to replace or sharpen them. [7] X Research source The screwdriver that fits the screws on the lid might not fit the screws on the blade, so you’ll need a different screwdriver."

      "title": "Sharpen the blade with a sharpening stone.",
      "content": "Sharpen the blade with a sharpening stone. If the blade is dull, then a quick sharpening should do the trick. Wet a normal sharpening stone with some water, then rub the blade back and forth across the stone at a 20-degree angle. Continue until the blade sharpens, which is usually after a few passes. [8] X Research source You’ll know your blade needs sharpening when it stops removing large, even frills of wood from your pencil tips. It may only take off small flakes or nothing at all. Sharpening such a small blade can be difficult because it's tough to hold. Try wearing a pair of disposable gloves to get a better grip on the metal. It may be easier to just replace the blade with a fresh one from the manufacturer (or buy a similar size and style online). Dirty blade? In some cases, the blade just needs a quick cleaning instead of a sharpening. Try wiping some rubbing alcohol on the blade with a cotton pad to get rid of any gunk that's stopping it from sharpening properly. Work slowly along the edge to avoid cuts."

      "title": "Screw the blade back into the sharpener.",
      "content": "Screw the blade back into the sharpener. Whether you're using a fresh blade or you sharpened the old one, putting the blade back on is simple. Place the blade back into the slot you removed it from and line up the blade hole with the hole on the sharpener. Then, put the screw back in and turn it clockwise until it's tight. [9] X Research source If the blade has more than one screw hole, make sure you line all of them up. How often do you need to sharpen the blade? It depends on how often you use it. The friction from sharpening dulls the blade over time, so the more you sharpen, the faster the blade will get dull. Some feel their blade getting dull after just a couple of uses.
