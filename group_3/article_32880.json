      "content": "Red light therapy can help shorten the body's recovery time. After giving your all in a workout, it's common to experience muscle soreness. Planet Fitness’ Total Body Enhancement machines use red light therapy (RLT) which can potentially stimulate the body's collagen production and blood circulation to help relieve muscle tension. [1] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Paired with the machine’s vibration plate, this may reduce cell inflammation and help you to nail the following day's workout a little easier. [2] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source It's important to note that while Planet Fitness' Total Body Enhancement (TBE) machines are advertised as infrared saunas, they're not. Infrared saunas use 1000nm or higher infrared light for deep tissue and heat therapy benefits. TBE machines deliver red wavelengths between 620-700nm, a common RLT wavelength.

      "content": "Red light therapy might help cells work more efficiently. While scientists are still exploring whether red light therapy is effective or not, they believe that when your skin is exposed to wavelengths of red light between 600nm or higher, the light may boost energy to the center of the mitochondria (the cell's powerhouse). This is thought to help the cells work more efficiently to promote healing and skin rejuvenation. [4] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Red light is believed to travel further into your skin compared to other LED lights. [5] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source RTL differs from traditional skin devices, like lasers, because lasers can cause skin irritation. However, RTL is a non-invasive treatment that is less likely to cause trauma to the skin. Note : There isn’t enough evidence to suggest that RLT is an effective treatment option, though some studies indicate that it can help with conditions like acne, hair loss, and muscle soreness. [6] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source More research is needed to determine its efficacy and long-term effects."

      "content": "Yes—when used as a short-term recovery aid and as directed. Red light therapy is a non-toxic, non-invasive skin treatment with no major side effects. However, it’s important to wear eye protection and ensure your light level is not too harsh. For instance, daily use of RLT with 1,000 nm can cause thermal damage to your skin. [11] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Refer to the manufacturer's recommended use and light levels before using RLT. Don't use RLT if you're pregnant or breastfeeding, have a condition with photosensitivity, or are on medications that make you photosensitive.
