If you are using two fingers, try to grab the edge of the condom between your two fingers. Squeeze the edges tightly between your fingers as you slowly try to pull it out. If you cannot reach the condom, ask your partner to pull out the condom. Your partner should insert one or two fingers and feel around for the condom. Once he touches the condom, he should gently pull it out. Try your best to keep any semen from spilling out of the condom as you pull it out if possible."

Insert a finger inside your vagina as far as you can. If you cannot feel the condom, move your finger back and forth to try and locate it.

At either your gynecologist’s office, the ER, or an Urgent Care Center, a pelvic examination will be performed. This will be similar to a normal pelvic exam, in which you lie down with your feet placed into stirrups and your knees apart. The practitioner will use a speculum and see if the condom can be removed manually. If not, long forceps may be used to pull the condom out. The examination is usually not painful, but it may be somewhat uncomfortable."

This not only helps protect from STIs and prevent the condom breaking, it also helps keep it from falling off during intercourse. [10] X Research source The condom should be unrolled onto an erect penis, making certain to leave room at the tip for the semen. Place the condom on the head of the penis, leaving about a half-inch of space at the top. Pinch the condom at the top, pushing all the air out of it. Continue unrolling the condom along the shaft of the penis. As you are unrolling, wrap your thumb and index finger around the penis right below the pinched condom to ensure that space remains. Smooth out any air bubbles that are in the condom."

Behavioral interventions for improving condom use for dual protection. Cochrane Database Syst Rev. 2013 Oct 26;10:CD010662 Polyurethane condoms tend to break and slip off more often than others.
