Use chalk to mark out the rectangle. Use pins to hold the folded fabric together while you are measuring it out. For example, if your final head measurement was 28 in (71 cm), your rectangle on the fabric will be 28 in × 4.5 in (71 cm × 11 cm). While any fabric will do, a thicker, jersey type material is best. You can also use the fabric from an old t-shirt if you prefer. [7] X Research source Approximately 36 in (91 cm) will work well for making a few headbands, depending on the width of the fabric."
