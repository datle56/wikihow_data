      "title": "Drink water.",
      "content": "Drink water. Water is by far the best choice for your body. Other than being refreshing, free, and easily accessible, it can also help you maintain a healthy weight. People who drink more water tend to take in fewer calories throughout the rest of the day.

      "title": "Consume tea or coffee.",
      "content": "Consume tea or coffee. It’s a myth that caffeinated beverages will dehydrate you. While caffeine itself is dehydrating, the water in tea and coffee more than makes up for it. Make it more refreshing by adding ice to create iced tea or iced coffee. [2] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Choose a sports drink.",
      "content": "Choose a sports drink. Sports beverages like Gatorade and Powerade contain electrolytes, which are important minerals that your body loses when it sweats. So if you’re thirsty after exercising or being out in the heat, choose one of these high-sodium drinks. [3] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Drink a carbonated beverage.",
      "content": "Drink a carbonated beverage. Carbonation can make a drink more refreshing and influence you to drink more liquid than you would have otherwise. It won't hydrate you any better than other beverages – it just quenches your thirst quickly. [4] X Research source Opt for a diet soda or sparkling water in order to cut out any extra sugar."
    },
    {
      "title": "Try coconut water.",
      "content": "Try coconut water. The clear liquid in the center of a coconut is the coconut water, and it's become one of the fastest-growing beverage categories in the industry. It's not only refreshing but also packed with vitamins, nutrients, and electrolytes, so it's another good option for rehydrating after a workout."
    },
    {
      "title": "Make your beverages cold.",
      "content": "Make your beverages cold. Cold drinks have been shown to reduce thirst more effectively than warm or room temperature beverages. Add ice to your drink or store a pitcher of water in the fridge so you always have access to chilled water. [5] X Research source If you need to chill a beverage quickly and don’t want to water it down by putting ice in it, try placing it (in a sealed bottle or can) into a bowl with water, ice, and a generous amount of salt. This will chill it in about five minutes. [6] X Research source For on-the-go cold drinks, fill a thermos or insulated water bottle with ice but no water. This will cause it to melt more slowly."

      "title": "Eat fruits like watermelon and strawberries.",
      "content": "Eat fruits like watermelon and strawberries. Watermelon is made of 92 percent water, and also contains several vitamins and minerals, like salt, that are important for rehydration. Strawberries have more water than any other berry and also have the added bonus of being packed with vitamin C. [7] X Research source Other examples of water-rich fruits are cantaloupe, pineapple, and raspberries."

    {
      "title": "Choose vegetables like cucumbers or celery.",
      "content": "Choose vegetables like cucumbers or celery. Cucumbers have the highest water content of any solid food (96 percent), so they’re the perfect choice for quenching your thirst when you’re not in the mood to drink anything. Celery is a close second, and the added crunch will give you some texture variety. [8] X Research source Other example of water-rich vegetables are lettuce, spinach, and green peppers."

    {
      "title": "Make a chilled soup.",
      "content": "Make a chilled soup. While soup may not seem like the most refreshing option, a cold soup made of cucumber, greek yogurt, mint, and ice cubes can be blended quickly for a hydrating and low-calorie meal. Try other cold soup recipes like watermelon gazpacho, tomato gazpacho, or cool avocado soup."
