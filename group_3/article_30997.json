Be sure to look at the manufacturer's instructions and labels and select one that matches your needs. [2] X Research source All Roundup products are suitable for driveways, patios, and gravel. Select Roundup Extended Control Weed & Grass Killer Plus and Roundup Weed & Grass Killer Concentrate Plus for use on tree rings and mulch beds. Use Roundup Poison Ivy Plus Tough Brush Killer for poison ivy and woody brush. Try Roundup Max Control 365 products for fence lines and foundations. Choose Roundup for Lawns for yard application."

For smaller crops, you can use Roundup in amounts from 2.5 ounces (71 g) to 6 ounces (170 g) per 1 gallon (3.8 L) of water. Always check the manufacturer's directions and note the necessary Roundup amount in ounces (or grams). [3] X Research source Roundup Concentrate Max Control 365, Roundup Concentrate Extended Control Weed & Grass Killer Plus Weed Preventer, and Roundup Concentrate Poison Ivy Plus Tough Brush Killer require 6 ounces (170 g) of product per 1 gallon (3.8 L) of water. Roundup Weed & Grass Killer Super Concentrate requires 2.5 ounces (71 g) or 1.5 ounce (43 g) per 1 gallon (3.8 L) of water. Roundup Weed & Grass Killer Concentrate Plus requires 6 ounces (170 g) or 3 ounces (85 g) per 1 gallon (3.8 L) of water."

For Roundup Concentrate Poison Ivy Plus Tough Brush Killer, which requires 6 ounces (170 g) of product per 1 gallon (3.8 L), use 12 ounces (340 g) of Roundup in total (6 x 2).

      "content": "Divide the acid equivalent value by the pounds per gallon value for large areas. If your Roundup doesn't list the amount of herbicide to use per 1 acre (4046.86 meters squared), you need to calculate it yourself. Divide the acid equivalent (a.e) amount by the amount of the product in pounds per gallon listed on the label. For example, if the a.e. is 3 pounds (1.4 kg) per 1 acre (4046.86 meters squared) and there is 2 pounds (0.91 kg) per 1 gallon (3.8 L), 3 pounds divided by 2 pounds is 1.5 gallons (5.7 L) per acre—the amount of product you need. [5] X Research source If you're covering a small area or your Roundup product lists the amount of the herbicide formulation you need to use in pounds per acre, skip this step and start filling your tank sprayer."

      "content": "Use the pounds per acre value to calculate the herbicide amount for large crops. Herbicides can be applied either uniformly over the surface of the field (broadcast) or in narrow strips centered over rows (bands). If you're applying Roundup by broadcast, take the application rate at face value. For bands, multiply the broadcast rate by the width of the band and then divide the total by the width of the row. [6] X Research source Consider a Roundup that has a broadcast application rate of 3 pounds (1.4 kg) per acre: if you need to apply your herbicide in 10 inch (25 cm) bands over 30 inch (76 cm) rows, the band application rate is (3 x 10) / 30, or 1 pound (0.45 kg) per acre."

      "title": "Fill up the tank sprayer halfway with water.",
      "content": "Fill up the tank sprayer halfway with water. Smaller tank sprayers typically hold 1 to 2 gallons (3.8 to 7.6 L) of water. For example, if you're planning to use 1 gallon (3.8 L) of water and Roundup solution, fill your tank to 0.5 gallon (1.9 L) with a garden hose. Avoid using low-temperature water, which causes herbicide buildup at the bottom of the tank. Always double check manufacturers directions and pour the amount of water recommended for the amount of Roundup product your using."

Once the plunger is completely inside the tank, grip the handle, turn it to the left, and pull it up and down to complete 1 pump. Continue this process until you complete 10 to 15 pumps to mix the Roundup and water. After the final pump, turn the handle to the right to lock it into place. [9] X Research source The process of mixing your herbicide and water is called agitation. Be sure to check the manufacturer's instructions for any specific guidelines or pumping recommendations."
