Give both players a board and open all of the doors so the characters are visible. [1] X Research source If it’s your first time playing the game, punch out the small face cards for each color. Slide each card into one of the doors on the matching player board. It doesn’t matter what order the face cards are in, and they don’t have to be in the same order on both boards. [2] X Research source There are multiple versions of the Guess Who game, and the characters may vary between each edition. The game is still played the same way no matter which version you have."

Each player takes 1 card from the deck and places it in the slot at the front of their player board. [3] X Research source Keep character cards hidden from the other player. If either player accidentally sees the card the other person drew, put it back in the deck and draw a new one."

      "title": "Ask a yes or no question about the other player’s character.",
      "content": "Ask a yes or no question about the other player’s character. The youngest player takes the first turn of the game. The player looks at the characters on their own player board, and asks a single yes or no question about a physical trait they have. The other player must answer the question truthfully about their character. Some good questions to ask include: [4] X Research source Is your character a boy/girl? Does your character have blue eyes? Is your character wearing a hat? Does your character have rosy cheeks? Try to ask a question that applies to multiple characters at the same time. That way, you may be able to rule out a lot of characters at the same time. Avoid asking open-ended or subjective questions. For example, the answer to a question like “Does your character look like a good person?” may vary between players, but “Is your character smiling?” can be answered with a simple yes or no."

      "content": "Flip down any characters that are ruled out by the player’s answer. Once an opponent gives an answer about their character, the player checks all of the open doors on their own player board. If they said “yes” to the question, then flip down any characters that do not have the trait. If the player said “no,” then flip down characters that do have the trait that was asked about. [5] X Research source Example: If you asked, “Does your character wear glasses?” and your opponent says yes, then flip down any character that isn’t wearing glasses. If they say no, then flip down any character that is wearing glasses."

If the player gets the character right, then they immediately win! However, if the player gets it wrong, they immediately lose the game. [7] X Research source You don’t have to flip down all the characters on your player board to make a guess. Ruling out more characters just makes it easier to guess correctly. If you want to play a Championship Series of Guess Who, deal out new character cards to each player. Once a player wins a total of 5 games, they’re the Guess Who champion!"
