      "content": "The “Roshambo” game most likely comes from Asian cultures. Shoudhling, meaning “hand command,” was originally mentioned by the Chinese writer Xie Zhaoshi from the Ming Dynasty as a game played during the Han Dynasty. In the 17th century, a Chinese drinking game called Mushi-Ken, meaning “Frog, Slug, Snake” became popular in Japan. [2] X Research source Some people believe that Roshambo is the name of a Japanese game with “ro,” “sham,” and “bo,” being the words for each hand symbol. However, the Japanese name for the game is Janken or Jan-ken-pon. This game features a rock, paper, and scissors, and was created in the late 19th century in Japan. By the early 20th century, the game started to become popular outside of Asia."

Each of the 3 items loses against an item, wins against another item, and ties with itself. If 2 people pick the same item, it’s a tie and they should start again. The player who picks the strongest item wins! [6] X Research source Paper “covers” rock but is “cut” by scissors. Rock “crushes” scissors but is “covered” by paper.

      "title": "Keep your hand in a fist until the last second.",
      "content": "Keep your hand in a fist until the last second. A smart player keeps an eye on what you’re doing with your hand right before you choose your item and make the hand sign. For example, if you tuck your thumb inside your fist as you tap your palm and then move it to the outside whenever you throw rock, they’ll be able to quickly throw paper to beat you. Keep an eye out for your opponents’ tells or hints at what they want to pick. Some people might make a certain face every time they throw paper or move their wrist in a specific way whenever they throw scissors. These hints can be different for every person, so watch them closely to see if you notice anything."

[8] X Research source However, be ready to change things up if they notice your strategy or you may end up losing. Choose your item at random until you notice a pattern in your opponents’ choices."

If you win the first round, don’t play the same item. Instead, play the item that beats the one you just won with. [9] X Research source Researchers found that a player is more likely to choose an item that they won with in the previous round. So, choosing an item that beats the winning one is a good bet. This is called the “win-stay, lose-shift” strategy."

There are even professional leagues and tournaments in the U.S. Each of the different countries may have different rules or items used to play the game we call Roshambo or Rock-Paper-Scissors. Mushi-Ken: This ancient Chinese was played by making a frog by sticking up a thumb, a slug by extending a little finger, or a snake by extending an index finger. [10] X Research source Muk-jji-ppa: 2 players play Roshambo with the winner becoming the attacker and the loser the defender. They continue to play quick rounds of Roshambo. If the attacker wins a round, they continue to attack. If the defender wins a round, they become the attacker, and so on. During each round, the attacker shouts which item they intend to throw to try to trick the defender into choosing the same one so the attacker wins the game. [11] X Research source Jak-en-poy: People play this game in the Philippines. It’s played the same way as Roshambo, but the players sing, “Jack-en-poy! Hali-hali-hoy! Sino'ng matalo, siya'ng unggoy!” The player who has won the most rounds by the end of the song wins the game. [12] X Research source Suten: This Indonesian version uses elephant (a slightly raised thumb), human (raised index finger), and ant (raised pinky finger). The elephant beats the human, the human beats the ant, and the ant beats the elephant. [13] X Research source"

      "content": "Some people play variations with more than 4 items. Roshambo and Rock-Paper-Scissors are most commonly played with 3 items, but it can be played with any number of items. However, each time you add an item, the game becomes more complex. Here are a few common variations: Pierre, papier, ciseaux, puits: This is a French game that translates as “stone, paper, scissors, well.” Players make the same 3 items as Roshambo and add a well, which is made by creating a circle with their thumb and finger. With 4 items, the game is unbalanced because the well and paper beat 2 items each (well beats stone and scissors & paper beats stone and well). However, the rock and the scissors can only beat one item each (rock beats scissors & scissors beats paper). [14] X Research source Rock, paper, scissors, Spock, lizard : In this game, scissors beat paper & lizard, paper beats rock & Spock, rock beats lizard & scissors, and lizard beats Spock & paper, and Spock beats scissors & rock. Make lizard by pressing your fingers together and making a mouth with your hand. Hold your index and middle finger together and your ring finger and pinky finger together with a space between them to make the Vulcan salute for Spock. [15] X Research source Rock, paper, scissors, fire, water, grass: This variation adds 3 new items. Fire beats grass, paper, and scissors. Grass beats rock, paper, and scissors. Water beats fire, paper, and scissors. [16] X Research source"
