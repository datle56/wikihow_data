[1] X Research source If the soil holds too much water, your plant's roots could rot. [2] X Research source An aroid mix or orchid potting mix can be good options—both contain chunky material that aerates the soil and allows the water to drain out quickly."

      "content": "Keep your Monstera adansonii in indirect light. If you're keeping the plant inside, place it near a window that faces east or west. If you're planning to keep it outside, find a shady spot, like under a tree. [3] X Research source Too much sunlight can cause an adonsonii's leaves to turn brown or black. If one side of your swiss cheese plant gets more light than the other, rotate it every few weeks so it will grow evenly. Don't plant your adansonii outdoors. If you keep it outside, plant it in a container. In warm places like Florida that mimic its native environment, this plant may actually be considered invasive. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Water your plant when the top 1 in (2.5 cm) of the soil feels dry. When you’re watering your adansonii , remove the planter from its saucer or tray and place it over a sink or bowl. Evenly pour the water directly onto the soil, and avoid getting too much water on the leaves, or the leaves might get discolored. [5] X Research source Let the water finish draining completely before you return the plant to its saucer Avoid watering too frequently, and don’t let your swiss cheese plant sit in a tray full over water. Too much water could rot the plant’s root. [6] X Research source Water your adansonii less frequently during winter when the plant is dormant. [7] X Research source For instance, you might allow the top 2 in (5.1 cm) of soil to dry before you water again."

      "content": "Keep your Monstera adansonii at temperatures above 55 °F (13 °C). Monsteras are tropical plants, which means it grows in a warm climate. If you keep your adansonii outdoors, bring it inside or put it in a greenhouse if the temperature will be 55 °F (13 °C) or cooler. [8] X Research source Because they're tropical plants, adansonii are generally tolerant of higher temperatures, but the leaves might look limp on very hot days if you keep the pot outside."

      "title": "Increase the humidity if it's less than 60%.",
      "content": "Increase the humidity if it's less than 60%. Use a hygrometer to monitor the humidity near your plant, and add moisture to the air if it drops below 60%. This will give the plant the humidity it needs without soaking the roots. [9] X Research source Here are a few ways you can increase the humidity around your adansonii: Run a humidifier near your swiss cheese plant. Keep the plant in the bathroom while you take a shower. Lightly mist the plant once or twice a week. Place the planter in a shallow tray filled with pebbles. Add just enough water to cover the bottom of the tray, but not so much that it touches the bottom of the planter."

      "content": "Add a balanced liquid fertilizer during the growing season. Foliage plants like andsonii usually do best with a balanced fertilizer. The easiest way to feed the plant is to dilute the fertilizer in the plant's water, then water like normal. [10] X Trustworthy Source Royal Horticultural Society Leading gardening charity in the U.K. providing resources for identifying, growing and caring for flowers and other plants Go to source Look for a fertilizer with an NPK where the numbers are almost even, like 20-20-20 or 10-8-7 . [11] X Research source NPK stands for nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, and the number tells you the balance of the nutrients in that particular plant food. Don't fertilize your swiss cheese plant during the fall or winter. It will be dormant, which means it's not growing and doesn't need the food."

[12] X Research source Monstera adansonii uses its aerial roots to climb large trees in its native environment, so it needs plenty of room to grow. [13] X Research source If you’re planning to stake the plant, place your stake, moss pole, or trellis in the middle of the planter, just beside the base of the plant. Use small pieces of twine to tie the vines to the support to help train it.

Just don't remove more than about 25% of the plant, as it could affect the plant's health. [15] X Research source Be sure to save the cuttings—you can propagate them and grow new plants! Prune in the spring if you want to remove some of last year's growth, or prune in the late summer if you want to remove new growth."

Most Monsteras do best if they're repotted every two years. [17] X Research source But if your adansonii seems too big for its pot, or if you suspect the roots are waterlogged and rotting, you may need to repot it sooner. Choose a pot with drainage holes so water doesn't stay pooled in the container.

[33] X Research source The Monstera adansonii is a tropical plant that grows in rainforests in South America, Central America, and Mexico. [34] X Research source Monstera adansonii uses aerial roots to climb large trees in its native environment. [35] X Research source The adansonii develops its distinctive holes—known as fenestrations—to allow sunlight to filter through to the whole plant. [36] X Research source The adansonii is closely related to Monstera deliciosa, which is also called the swiss cheese plant. However, deliciosa has broad leaves, and its fenestrations go to the outside of the leaves. Adansonii has smaller, narrow leaves, and its fenestrations appear as holes in the leaves."
