Dry powder (which you mix with water) can be better at removing scratches and is less expensive. [2] X Research source Don't use any harsh chemicals or products to polish your granite."

      "content": "Clean the granite with warm water and dish soap. Using a dish cloth, gently wipe the stone to remove dirt or debris. Use a mild pH-neutral dish soap without ammonia or bleach. Harsh chemicals could strip away sealant. [3] X Research source Always clean the granite's surface before you start polishing it."

      "content": "Spray granite polish or cleaner over the entire area. Soap is good for cleaning but can leave granite looking dull so a stone-specific polish will restore shine. Never use a gritty or coarse product as this might scratch the surface or eat at the sealant. [4] X Research source Less is more. Only use the recommended amount of polish (read the box as using too much will leave a dull residue. A thorough cleaning should be done once a week to make your stone sparkle. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Buff with a dry microfiber towel. A microfiber cloth contains tiny split fibers that make it more absorbent than cotton, meaning it will soak up leftover residue instead of just smearing it around. [7] X Research source Rub in small circles with firm pressure."

If it leaves a watermark or soaks into the stone, you should seal your granite . [8] X Research source You should seal granite after polishing for best results. [9] X Research source"

Fill the rest of the bottle with water. [10] X Research source Shake to combine. Use a dish soap that doesn't have antibacterial additives which can leave streaks on the surface of the granite. [11] X Research source You can swap the dish soap for castile soap for a more environmentally-friendly alternative. Store your spray at room temperature. It should last for 1 to 2 months.

[21] X Research source Always use a cutting board when cooking, too, instead of placing food directly on the counter. Heat can also harm granite so don't put hot pots or pans directly on the stone. Use a trivet or hot pad. If you have granite floors, lay down some rugs to minimize grit being etched into the stone from being walked on."
