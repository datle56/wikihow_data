      "title": "Get a clear cost estimate beforehand.",
      "content": "Get a clear cost estimate beforehand. Know what you’ll pay well before you show up for your appointment. The cost will depend on several factors, including the size of the area to be treated. Many places charge by the minute and can give you a good estimate beforehand. You might even save money by scheduling multiple sessions over time. [2] X Research source For example, one salon might charge $49 for a 15-minute session and $75 for a 30-minute one. Weigh the pros and cons of paying more for a technician with lots of experience. For example, the upfront cost may be higher, but they might finish the job in fewer treatments."

      "title": "Compare electrolysis versus other procedures.",
      "content": "Compare electrolysis versus other procedures. There are many options available for hair removal, including waxing, tweezing, and laser treatments. Electrolysis can be more expensive than other options, and 10-12 treatments might be necessary compared to 3-6 with laser hair removal, but it is also more permanent. [3] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Decide which areas you’d like to focus on.",
      "content": "Decide which areas you’d like to focus on. An electrologist can remove hair from almost anywhere on the body. It helps if you have a list of ‘problem’ areas that you would like to address when you first talk with them. Hair on the jawline, sides of the face, abdomen, underarms, bikini areas, and other spots are all candidates for removal. [4] X Research source Electrolysis is especially effective at getting rid of hair in hard-to-reach places, like the ears."
    },
    {
      "title": "Get a personal referral.",
      "content": "Get a personal referral. If you have a friend or family who has had a good experience with electrolysis in the past, ask for the technician’s information. This is the best type of lead that you can get. It’s also okay to ask for previous case studies or samples done by the office where your work will be completed. [5] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Choose an electrologist and salon with a professional membership.",
      "content": "Choose an electrologist and salon with a professional membership. Technicians will often advertise or display their credentials publicly. In the United States, look for an American Electrology Association (AEA) certification. Make sure that the salon you are visiting offers “needle electrolysis” and not just a gimmick, such as hair reduction. [6] X Research source Many dermatologists' and cosmetic surgeons' offices also offer electrolysis. You may also be able to visit a registered nurse, nurse practitioner, or physician assistant for electrolysis. Look for signs of state licensing and continuing education as well. For example, certified professional electrologists (CPE) will often post their certifications of completion. [7] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Ask about sanitary procedures.",
      "content": "Ask about sanitary procedures. As health professionals, your electrologist should follow a standard set of cleaning and sterilization practices. When you visit the office or salon, ask what they do to promote patient safety. You’ll likely hear that they wear gloves and use sterile instruments. [8] X Research source This way, when you arrive on the day of the procedure you know what to expect in terms of safety. Feel free to halt the procedure at any moment if these rules aren’t followed."
    },
    {
      "title": "Sign up for skin care consultation.",
      "content": "Sign up for skin care consultation. This is an in-office visit where you can talk with the technician and ask as many questions as you want. Your technician will likely outline the entire process for you, so that you’ll know what to expect. You may also create a treatment schedule that could span several sessions and months, depending on your goals. [9] X Research source Some consultations even include a brief treatment session, so that you can see how your skin will react to the process. There is nothing wrong with consulting with several technicians before making your final choice. After all, you’ll be seeing this person multiple times and it’s important that you are comfortable."
    },
    {
      "title": "Expect several sessions over a period of months.",
      "content": "Expect several sessions over a period of months. Some sessions might last five minutes to remove just a few stray hairs. Or, they could span over an hour for a larger section of hair. The coarseness of the hair matters as well with thicker follicles taking longer to remove. Spreading out sessions over time helps to prevent skin irritation. [10] X Research source If you have a condition that causes excessive hair growth, also called hirsutism, expect your sessions to take longer."
    },
    {
      "title": "Know what will happen on your visit.",
      "content": "Know what will happen on your visit. When you first enter the room you’ll usually need to sit or lie down on a treatment table. The technician will apply a disinfectant to the area. Then, they will start inserting tiny needles into each hair root. They will conclude by pulling out each hair with long tweezers and rubbing lotion over the treated area. [11] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Do not shave or wax for three days beforehand.",
      "content": "Do not shave or wax for three days beforehand. Four days prior to your appointment go ahead and shave the area to be treated, if possible. Then, let the area grow out and leave it alone until your appointment. This will let the hairs grow long enough to be pulled out successfully with a tweezer. Avoid any other harsh skin treatments, such as chemical peels, in the days before your appointment. These can overburden your skin and make it react badly to electrolysis. [12] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Make sure your skin is clean and fresh before treatment.",
      "content": "Make sure your skin is clean and fresh before treatment. On the day of your appointment, take a shower or bath. Avoid using deodorant, antiperspirant, perfume, lotion, or oil on the treatment area. If your underarm is the focus, keep it bare. This will allow the hair follicles to stand more upright and make them easier to treat and remove."
    },
    {
      "title": "Drink plenty of water.",
      "content": "Drink plenty of water. The process of zapping each hair can dehydrate your skin, so make sure to drink at least eight glasses of water on the day of your appointment. It’s also recommended to avoid any sodas, coffee, or other caffeinated drinks on the treatment day."
    },
    {
      "title": "Take an over the counter pain reliever.",
      "content": "Take an over the counter pain reliever. About an hour before you head to your appointment, take the recommended dosage of your pain reliever of choice. This will help to dull the sensitivity of your skin and might make it easier for you to relax."
    },
    {
      "title": "Bring a book or some music.",
      "content": "Bring a book or some music. To pass the time during treatment and to keep your mind off the zapping sensation, download some music and put in your headphones. Or, take a book or some magazines into the room with you. Some people even relax enough to take a quick nap. [13] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Relax.",
      "content": "Relax. You can anticipate feeling a small amount of discomfort, but nothing that will be too intense. Deep breathing and loosening your muscles will make you more comfortable overall. Remember that your technician can stop the process at any point if you ask."
    },
    {
      "title": "Add skin cream or lotion to any red areas.",
      "content": "Add skin cream or lotion to any red areas. Your skin may appear slightly red or pink after treatment and that is completely normal. Treat it like you would a mild sunburn. Apply a good coating of aloe-based lotion and gel as often as you like. [14] X Research source Placing a cold compress on the treated area can also help the skin to heal. Keep it on for just a few minutes of time to avoid damaging your skin."
    },
    {
      "title": "Allow any scabs to fall off naturally.",
      "content": "Allow any scabs to fall off naturally. Some small scabs might show up a few days after your appointment. This is part of the healing process for your pores, so just leave them be. They will usually harden and fall off in 1-2 days."
    },
    {
      "title": "Stay out of the sun.",
      "content": "Stay out of the sun. Because your skin will be extra exposed and sensitive after treatment, try to stay indoors for at least 24 hours afterwards. If you have to go out, put on a high SPF sunscreen and/or keep the treated area covered. If your skin is exposed to too much sun after treatment it can lead to splotches and hyperpigmentation. The same advice goes for tanning beds. Stay away for at least one full day or until your skin feels healed."
    },
    {
      "title": "Avoid exercise.",
      "content": "Avoid exercise. Sweating during an exercise session can cause skin irritation in areas treated by electrolysis. It can also lead to infection if the pores become clogged. Take a break from working out heavily for at least a day or two following your procedure, especially if you had hairs removed from a sweat-prone area, like your armpits. [15] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Wear loose-fitting clothes.",
      "content": "Wear loose-fitting clothes. Avoid wearing tight or restricting clothes after a treatment. Air circulation is important for maximum healing, especially if you received treatment on your bikini area, the back of the neck, or on your underarms."
    },
    {
      "title": "Wait at least two weeks before your next session.",
      "content": "Wait at least two weeks before your next session. This gives your skin enough time to heal in between treatments. It also ensures ample time for any stray hairs to regrow to full length, making it possible for a technician to remove them. When in doubt about how often to schedule your appointments, talk with your technician and follow their guidance."
