      "content": "Select a clear, 40 watt bulb. Light bulbs below 40 watts will also work. You just want to ensure that your paint withstands the heat made from the bulb once it’s turned on. [1] X Research source Clear bulbs will give you the best effect of the light shining through the paint. You can use frosted bulbs, but the colored light coming through won’t be as vibrant."

      "title": "Purchase special heat-resistant glass paint.",
      "content": "Purchase special heat-resistant glass paint. Find paint that is made for glass or safe for painting ceramics at your local craft store. Do not use regular acrylic or oil-based paint on light bulbs. When you turn your light bulb on, regular paint on the hot glass can cause your light bulb to explode. Examples of appropriate paint to use are DecoArt Glass-tiques, Decoart Liquid Rainbow, FolkArt Gallery Glass Liquid Leading, and Vitrea by Pebeo"

      "title": "Clean your light bulbs with rubbing alcohol.",
      "content": "Clean your light bulbs with rubbing alcohol. You’ll want a clean, dust free surface for painting, so that the paint adheres to your bulb well. Soak a cotton ball with rubbing alcohol and rub your light bulb with it. [2] X Research source Use soap and water if you don’t have any rubbing alcohol. Dry your bulb with a clean towel or allow it to air-dry for 1-2 minutes."

      "content": "Prop your light bulb up with tack. Use a small amount of blue tack or “sticky tack” to prop up your light bulb so that it won’t roll around while you paint. Blue tack is available at craft stores and in some office supply stores. [3] X Research source You can also use Play-doh or some air-dry clay if you don’t have any blue tack."

      "content": "Use small brushes to apply your paint. Apply your first color in a light, thin layer and see how it looks. You can free-hand your picture, or use stencils by using peel-off stickers or stencils you design yourself with paper. [4] X Research source Paint a detailed picture on your light bulb, cover it with stars or flowers, or simply make blocks of color for a stained glass or rainbow effect. For Halloween bulbs, paint pumpkins or ghosts on your light bulbs. For custom holiday lights, paint your bulbs red and green or with snowflakes."

Follow any instructions on the packaging of your paint for heat-curing your light bulb in the oven. [7] X Research source Remove any food or cooking items from your oven before using it to heat cure your light bulbs. Place your light bulb on an oven safe pan if your paint instructions require it.

Glue four pieces of string up the sides of the light bulb and tie them all together in a knot at the top. Make a loop out of one string to hang the bulb, and trim the rest. Instead of painting the design on the bulb, you can attach fabric scraps with decoupage to the bulb before gluing on the strings."
