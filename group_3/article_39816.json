      "content": "Skrunkly describes something that is cute in a messy or unconventional way. Skrunkly is both an adjective and a noun used to describe something that is kind of funky-looking but also attractive or cute, often because it’s scruffy or disheveled. Skrunkly is a positive term of endearment that’s mainly used to describe animals, particularly strange-looking cats and dogs, but the internet has also adapted it to describe celebrities and fictional characters. [1] X Research source Examples: “My cat fell in the bathtub and now he looks all skrunkly.” “My favorite characters are always so skrunkly. They’re just funky little guys.” “That dog has really scruffy fur and crooked teeth. He's skrunkly.” Skrunkly is sometimes spelled as “scrunkly,” “scrungly,” or “skrungly.” These words all have the same meaning. While the exact etymology of the “skrunkly” is unknown, it may be a blend of the words “scrunched” and “crinkly.”"

      "content": "Throughout 2021, the skrunkly meme gained popularity on other social media apps. On June 14, 2021, YouTuber Bakamatsu posted a voiceover video of the meme’s caption with an image of a cat in place of the fox, which gained over 3,300 likes in two months. On the same day, Twitter (now X) user @dailyseafriends posted their own version of the meme, replacing the fox with an image of a sea creature. This skrunkly trend continued as social media users made their own versions of the meme. [3] X Research source As the meme gained popularity, many people started posting the caption with images of characters from various media. People then started using the word “skrunkly” in daily life to describe different animals and characters."

      "content": "Scrimblo/Scrimblo Bimblo “Scrimblo” describes something or someone that is cute and lovable. It is derived from Scrimblo Bimblo, which is a made-up video game character from a tweet poking fun at Super Smash Bros fans who get upset when their favorite obscure characters aren’t included in the games. Scrimblo Bimblo has come to describe a well-loved, yet underappreciated character or celebrity. [4] X Research source For example, “That character is so scrimblo. They’re absolutely adorable!”"

      "content": "Poor little meow meow A “poor little meow meow” is someone, often a fictional character, who is downtrodden, morally questionable/evil, and/or pathetic. The term was originally a nickname for Suga of BTS because the band’s fandom believed he looked like a cat. It quickly spread across social media and fandoms and became associated with sad, morally gray characters. [5] X Research source For example, “Yes, my favorite character may be a murderer, but he’s just my poor little meow meow.”"

      "content": "Eeby deeby “Eeby deeby” is a term for a made-up or unknown location. This phrase originated with an image of an elevator displaying the words “Eeby deeby” rather than the floor number it was going to. The meme became popular around the same time as words like “blorbo” and “scrimblo,” and they’re often associated with each other because they’re nonsense words. [7] X Research source For example, “My blorbo fell off a cliff at the end of the last episode. She went straight to eeby deeby.”"
