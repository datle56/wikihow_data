      "title": "Dirty condenser fan or coils",
      "content": "Dirty condenser fan or coils Over time, dirt can build up on the condenser fan or condenser coils. This can block the condenser fan from turning or keep it from operating efficiently, so you might hear a buzzing sound. [1] X Research source How to diagnose it: Unplug the fridge and pull it out from the wall, then check the condenser fan and condenser coils for dirt or dust. You may need to remove a cover to see the condenser coils—consult your owner’s manual to see how to access them. How to fix it: If the condenser fan or condenser coils are dirty, wait until they’re defrosted, then vacuum them with a soft brush or clean them with a refrigerator coil brush . Also, make sure nothing has fallen behind the fridge and blocked the condenser fan. Maintenance: Grigorian recommends pulling your fridge away from the wall periodically to clean dirt, dust, and pet hair that may be clogging the condenser coils. He says, “If you do this every 6 months, it will prolong the life of your refrigerator, and it will also run more efficiently during the summer months.”"

      "title": "Blocked evaporator fan",
      "content": "Blocked evaporator fan Having too much food in your fridge can block the flow of air to the evaporator fan. The fan can also get blocked if too much frost builds up on the fan blades. This can cause a buzzing noise when the fan tries to turn. You may also notice that your fridge isn’t getting as cold as it usually does. [2] X Research source How to diagnose it: Locate the evaporator fan—it’s usually on the back wall of the freezer. If the area in front of the fan is packed tight with food, that could be the problem. If not, visually inspect the fan to see if it’s covered with frost. If you can’t tell if the fan is blocked, unplug the fridge, then see if you can rotate the fan with your hand. [3] X Research source How to fix it: Clear out your fridge so air can circulate around the evaporator fan. If there’s frost, unplug your fridge and thaw it out, then clean up any water as the ice melts. When to call a pro: If the evaporator fan isn’t blocked but it still isn’t running correctly, the motor may be bad. According to Beth, issues with frost buildup can be caused by a faulty timer or heater, or you might have an air leak. Grigorian advises that it’s best to have these types of issues diagnosed and repaired by a professional."

      "title": "Cracked drain pan",
      "content": "Cracked drain pan If water freezes inside the drain pan, the pan could crack or shift out of place. If this happens, you might hear a rattling noise when the refrigerator is running. [4] X Research source How to diagnose it: Consult your owner’s manual to see how to access the drain pan—it will be near the bottom of the fridge, behind either the kick panel on the bottom front of the fridge or the panel on the back of the fridge. [5] X Research source Check whether the pan is cracked, and make sure it’s in the right place. How to fix it: If the drain pan has shifted out of place, move it back to the location indicated on your owner's manual. If it’s damaged, replace it with a new one. A new drip pan can cost $50–$150 depending on the make and model of your fridge."

      "content": "Bad start relay If your refrigerator start relay is going bad, you may hear a click, then a buzz when your refrigerator starts running. You might also notice that your fridge isn’t staying as cool as it usually does. [6] X Research source How to diagnose it: Unplug the fridge and pull it away from the wall. Use your owner’s manual to locate the start relay near the side of the compressor—you’ll likely need to remove a panel. Use a flathead screwdriver to pop the start relay cover loose, then pull the relay off of the compressor. Gently shake the relay—if you hear a rattling noise, the relay is bad. How to fix it: Pull the wires off of the old relay—use needle-nose pliers if you can’t do it by hand. Then, reconnect the wires to the new relay , push the relay into place on the compressor, and replace the cover. [7] X Research source A new relay usually costs between $10 and $20."

      "title": "Bad compressor",
      "content": "Bad compressor Unfortunately, once the compressor on a fridge starts going out, it’s usually time to start thinking about a new fridge. Replacing the compressor is pretty expensive—with parts and labor, it can easily cost around $800. And there’s no guarantee that the repair will be long-lasting, especially if the fridge is fairly old. In the long run, it may cost less to buy a new fridge. How to diagnose it: If you hear loud buzzing from the bottom or back of the fridge, it could be the compressor. [8] X Research source If you can’t fix the problem yourself, Beth recommends having a professional diagnose the problem and tell you whether it would be cheaper to repair or replace the fridge. How to fix it: Because the fridge compressor contains hazardous materials like refrigerant, replacing a compressor should only be done by a qualified repair technician. [9] X Research source"

      "title": "Ice maker",
      "content": "Ice maker If your ice maker is on but it isn’t attached to the water line, you might hear a buzzing sound as the ice maker tries to draw in water. Or, if your ice maker is hooked up to a water supply and is working properly, the buzzing sound could just be the sound of the ice maker filling up. [10] X Research source How to diagnose it: Listen to see if the sound is coming from the ice maker. If you’re not sure whether the ice machine is hooked up to a water line, look for a small flexible hose running from the back of the fridge. How to fix it: If the ice maker isn’t hooked up to a water line, turn off the power switch on the ice machine so you won’t hear it running anymore. If it is hooked up to a water line, the sound is normal and you don’t need to do anything."

      "title": "Unlevel fridge",
      "content": "Unlevel fridge When the compressor kicks on, the whole fridge vibrates slightly. If the fridge isn’t level, those vibrations might create a buzzing sound. [11] X Research source The fridge could also be slightly touching the cabinets, wall, or other appliances around it. [12] X Research source How to diagnose it: Place a level on top of the fridge or look under the fridge and check whether the leveling feet are even. You can also pull the fridge out from the wall to see if it stops buzzing. How to fix it: According to Beth, most fridges have leveling feet on the front of the fridge that you can use to make sure it sits evenly on the floor. Beth also says that if the floor under the fridge is uneven, you can use thin pieces of plywood as spacers to level the fridge. If the fridge is already level, try shifting it slightly away from the cabinets or wall."

      "title": "Loose screws",
      "content": "Loose screws The vibrations from your fridge can loosen the screws that hold your fridge together. This can amplify the vibrations, leading to a louder-than-normal buzzing sound. [13] X Research source How to diagnose it: Go through your fridge and gently wiggle various parts to see if any of them are loose, including the doors, handles, shelves, motor mounts, and fans. Also, check whether you put any items on top of the fridge that could create a buzzing noise when the fridge vibrates. How to fix it: Use a small screwdriver to tighten any loose screws in the fridge."

      "title": "New fridge",
      "content": "New fridge If the fridge is new, you may not be used to the sound. Fridges might make a buzzing sound when the compressor comes on, for instance. [14] X Research source How to diagnose it: Pay attention to how often you hear the buzzing sound and monitor the temperature of the fridge with a fridge thermometer . If the fridge buzzes at fairly regular intervals and your fridge is staying at a steady, cool temperature, there’s a chance that it’s just the way the fridge sounds when it operates. How to fix it: Nothing to fix here! If the fridge is brand-new, give it a little time—newer fridges sometimes get quieter after they’ve settled in. You may also find that you get used to the sound over time."

      "title": "Why is my fridge clicking?",
      "content": "Why is my fridge clicking? Fridges normally make a clicking sound when the compressor or ice maker comes on. If the clicking continues, the ice maker may not be connected to a water line—check the valve where the water line connects to the ice maker to be sure it hasn’t come loose. [17] X Research source"

[20] X Research source Grigorian also recommends vacuuming the coils on the back of the fridge twice a year. You can also use a fridge thermometer to ensure the temperature of the fridge remains constant."
