      "content": "Clean the area of any dirt or debris. First, remove any furniture that might get in the way or be damaged by the cleaner you use, and tape off any baseboard trim. Cleaning specialist Regina DeCorte recommends cleaning concrete by vacuuming or sweeping away debris, then scrubbing the concrete with hot, soapy water using a stiff bristle brush. You can also remove residue like carpet adhesive with a scraper . Starting with a clean floor means you won’t create a muddy mess when you start using cleaners, nor will you drive any of the grime down into the porous surface of the concrete. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Locate the urine by smell or with a UV flashlight. If you have a UV light (or blacklight), turn off the lights in the room and hold the UV light 1-3 feet from the floor. Urine stains usually show up as a yellow, blue, or green mark, so use a piece of chalk to mark any spots you see. If you don’t have a UV light, air out the room, then simply sniff around until you find the smelly area. [2] X Research source Using a UV light can sometimes reveal the site of an old stain, which is helpful if you’ve already washed the floor and there’s no longer a visible stain. It’s possible to simply spot-treat the concrete, focusing on the urine spots you outlined, but it is recommended to treat the entire floor so you don’t miss any spots that didn’t show up. Treating the entire floor will also keep it from looking spotty."

      "content": "Scrub trisodium phosphate (TSP) into the concrete. Put on protective goggles and rubber gloves to protect yourself from harsh chemicals. Create a mixture of TSP and hot water, using 1/2 cup of TSP for every gallon of water, then pour the mixture onto the concrete. [3] X Research source Work in small increments (about 3x3 feet) so the TSP doesn’t dry out too quickly, and use a scrubbing brush to work it into the porous surface. Heavy-duty cleaners like TSP help ensure that all other elements of urine (like bacteria) are completely removed, making it easier for enzymatic cleaners to dissolve the uric crystals. Allow the TSP to sit on the surface for at least 5 minutes. If the mixture dries out before then, add more to the area. The longer it remains wet, the deeper it can penetrate the concrete. The urine smell may grow very strong as you pre-treat the floor. This is a normal reaction of uric acid crystals and water. If you don't want to use a heavy-duty chemical like TSP, try cleaning with a water and vinegar mixture (2 parts vinegar to 1 part water) instead. However, vinegar isn’t as strong and usually only masks the odor temporarily."

      "title": "Rinse and dry the concrete.",
      "content": "Rinse and dry the concrete. Pour hot water over the treated area, then use a wet/dry vacuum or shop vac to vacuum up all the liquid. This will remove most of the spent TSP solution. Then, rinse the floor with hot water two more times and allow the concrete to dry naturally overnight. [4] X Research source Don’t use fans to speed up the drying process. Your goal is to saturate the concrete and loosen up as much of the urine residue as possible. If your vacuum smells like urine after sucking up the TSP mixture, spray the hose with 1 part enzymatic cleaner and 30 parts water while the machine is running. Then, turn the machine off and spray the inside of the dirty water tank. If you use a carpet cleaner, add water to the tank instead of pouring water on the ground, then run it in a rinse/removal cycle."

      "title": "Prepare an enzymatic cleaner according to its instructions.",
      "content": "Prepare an enzymatic cleaner according to its instructions. While it’s sometimes possible to remove urine odors with natural products like baking soda or vinegar, enzyme cleaners are much stronger, as they work to break down the urine. Some cleaners must be mixed with a carpet cleaning solution, others require the addition of water, and some can be applied as-is. Follow all instructions carefully to make sure you apply the product properly. [5] X Research source Make sure the floor is entirely dry from pre-cleaning before you begin applying your enzymatic cleaner. Some popular enzymatic cleaners include Nature’s Miracle and Simple Solution . In general, any enzyme cleaners that target pet odors, like cat urine , will work."

      "title": "Saturate the area with the enzymatic cleaner.",
      "content": "Saturate the area with the enzymatic cleaner. Work in small sections of about 3x3 feet, and apply your cleaner to the concrete according to its instructions. Use enough of the solution so that there is standing liquid on the area for at least 10 minutes. Add more solution if the area begins to dry out, as it is essential for the liquid to permeate every layer and every pore of the cement to break down the uric crystals. [6] X Research source For easier application, use a clean deck or household sprayer . Using a dirty sprayer will cause residue (like mildew or dirt) to be sprayed into the absorbent concrete and may result in another bad smell. Be especially aggressive with the urine-stained areas you marked with the UV light. Consider using a scrub brush to really work the cleaner into those areas."

      "title": "Allow the concrete to dry overnight.",
      "content": "Allow the concrete to dry overnight. Once you have finished your treatment, allow the concrete to air dry naturally. Do not try to speed up the process. Instead, prolong the process by covering the floor with a plastic tarp. This will slow the evaporation of the solution and give it more time to work. If the smell persists after the concrete dries, treat heavily-soiled areas again with another round of enzymatic cleaner. [7] X Research source If the urine smell lingers in the air after you clean the concrete, cleaning expert Kadi Dulude says to leave bowls of vinegar around the room: “It will smell strongly [of] vinegar while you’re cleaning, but once that smell goes, it also tends to ‘take’ all bad smells with it.”"

      "content": "Seal your concrete floor to protect it from future odors. Make sure the urine smell has truly been eliminated, then seal your concrete floor to prevent urine or other liquids from seeping into its porous surface. This will make your floor much easier to clean in the future. Follow your sealant’s instructions to apply it correctly. [8] X Research source Landscaper Tony Hoang says that sealing concrete \"can preserve the look and longevity of the concrete while bringing out its rich color… It even helps fight stains by creating a thin layer between the spill and concrete.”"

      "title": "Alternatively, use baking soda or vinegar for a temporary solution.",
      "content": "Alternatively, use baking soda or vinegar for a temporary solution. If you don’t want to use harsh chemicals, natural odor eliminators like baking soda or white vinegar can sometimes cover urine odors. However, these solutions usually only mask the smell temporarily, so they’re best used as a quick fix until you can clean your concrete with stronger chemicals. [9] X Research source Bleach often works better than baking soda or vinegar, but many people report that it is also temporary. Even if you think the smell is gone after using conventional cleaning products, it will only take a little bit of moisture (even just a humid day) to revive the smell of urine. The presence of water causes the uric acid to release a gas, which creates a strong, foul odor. Cat urine is known to be particularly strong because it’s highly concentrated, so it may be best to skip the natural solutions and go straight to the enzymatic cleaner in this case."

      "title": "Hire professional cleaners if you can’t remove the smell yourself.",
      "content": "Hire professional cleaners if you can’t remove the smell yourself. Concrete is porous, so sometimes urine can seep so deep into the surface that it’s extremely difficult to remove. If you’ve already tried to get rid of the odor but it keeps coming back, it may be best to hire a professional cleaning crew. They have access to strong equipment and cleaners not available to the public, so they may be able to remove the smell more easily."

      "title": "Concrete is hard to clean because it is porous.",
      "content": "Concrete is hard to clean because it is porous. Concrete is porous, meaning it has tiny holes that allow moisture to pass through. Because of this dirt, grime, and stains (like urine) seep into the surface and become deeply embedded. Many cleaning solutions can not reach that far into the surface, making concrete difficult to clean. [10] X Research source"
