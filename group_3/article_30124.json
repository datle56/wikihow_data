      "content": "Create your side templates. Draw a polygon shape on a large sheet of cardboard or paper. If you use paper, use a heavyweight paper such as butcher paper or posterboard. The shape should be 9 inches (22.9 cm) on top, 12 inches on bottom, and 20 inches (50.8 cm) tall. Cut out the template. This will be used to create the sides of your windmill."

      "title": "Create the template for the blades.",
      "content": "Create the template for the blades. Draw an “X” shape on a large sheet of cardboard or heavy paper. Each arm of the “X” should be 16” long and 2” wide. Measure 2” from the exact center of the “X” shape on four sides to create a square shape around the center of the “X”. Cut out the template as one piece, making sure not to cut into the square shape."

      "title": "Transfer your template shapes to the plywood.",
      "content": "Transfer your template shapes to the plywood. Place the templates on your sheets of plywood. Use 1” plywood for the sides, top, and a 2”-diameter circle. Use ½” plywood for the “X”. Use a carpenter pencil to trace the shape of each template onto the wood. You will need six side pieces, one hexagonal top, one 2”-diameter circle, and one “X.” Use a drafting compass to easily draw a 2”-diameter circle onto the plywood. If you have a jar or can whose diameter is 2”, you could also use it to trace the circle. It is best to trace all the pieces you need onto the plywood before you start cutting. This way you make sure that you have laid out the pieces efficiently and have enough wood to complete your project. Do not use “chipboard” or MDF as it is likely to fall apart when it becomes wet.

Use a jigsaw to cut out all the pieces: [2] X Research source six side pieces, one hexagonal top, one “X” (for the blades), and one 2” circle. Circular saws are faster than jigsaws for long, straight cuts, but they cannot produce small shapes. If you have both, use a circular saw to cut out the sides and a jigsaw for the other pieces."
