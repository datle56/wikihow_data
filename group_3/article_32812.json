      "title": "Pisces and Sagittarius make a great match.",
      "content": "Pisces and Sagittarius make a great match. These 2 go-with-the-flow signs have so much in common: they’re both ruled by Jupiter, a planet of optimism and good fortune, and they’re both mutable signs. Their shared creativity, spontaneity, and optimism ensures they’re almost always in sync. Sure, water sign Pisces’ super sensitive side may not always jive with fire sign Sagittarius’ intensity and hot-headedness, but as long as they practice good communication and treat one another with respect, they’ll thrive as a couple. Though their communication styles may not always line up—Sagittarius can be rather blunt while shy Pisces can struggle to be confrontational—their endless hopefulness and curiosity will help them overcome any communication difficulty. [1] X Research source In fact, Sagittarius’s groundedness can counterbalance Pisces’ sometimes excessive dreaminess—and Pisces offers Sagittarius some emotional softness at times.

      "content": "Their open-mindedness and passion make their sex life super hot. Pisces and Sagittarius are the adventurous types, and that includes in the sack. Whether they bring toys into the bedroom or spice things up by exploring a new kink, sex between a Pisces and a Sagittarius is anything but dull. [3] X Research source Because they’re so creative and open to new experiences, a Pisces-Sag relationship is an opportunity for both signs to explore their sexual fantasies. Not only are they open to new experiences—they crave them! Pisces and Sagittarius can get bored easily, making creativity in the bedroom an imperative."

      "title": "Pisces might want more emotional intimacy in bed than Sag.",
      "content": "Pisces might want more emotional intimacy in bed than Sag. Watery Pisces is so in tune with emotions—theirs and everyone else’s—that sex is rarely, if ever, just sex: it’s a time to gaze into their lover’s eyes and really be present with their partner. And fiery, independent Sagittarius isn’t always up for that type of closeness. [4] X Research source This isn’t necessarily a red flag: Sagittarius may need some time to get more comfy experiencing soul-bonding sex with their Pisces amor, and they may not be able to be on Pisces’ level every time they bang, but gradually, and with patience from Pisces, these 2 can achieve a level of intimacy that works for both of them."

      "title": "Pisces tends to be more sensitive than ultra-candid Sagittarius.",
      "content": "Pisces tends to be more sensitive than ultra-candid Sagittarius. While Sagittarius will appreciate sensitive Pisces' ability to understand where they're coming from and be in tune with their needs and desires, they may feel like they have to handle their Pisces lover with kid gloves sometimes. [5] X Research source Pisces, meanwhile, may appreciate their Sag partner's honesty and refusal to shy away from uncomfortable truths, but they may feel they're unnecessarily blunt or even harsh at times. [6] X Research source Pisces can be funny—heck, they can be downright hilarious. But they’re not always great at telling when someone else is joking around, meaning their Sagittarius partner will have to be super careful with the sarcasm. Pisces' sensitivity is compounded by the fact that they often put their feelings aside for the sake of others. They may need to practice establishing and communicating emotional boundaries with their Sagittarius partner so that when Sag takes their brutal honesty a little too far, Pisces can stand up for themselves. [7] X Research source Sagittarius can temper the effects of their confrontational or bold personality by regularly reminding Pisces how much they care for them, and checking in during emotionally heightened conversations to see how Pisces is doing and encouraging them to take a break if needed.

      "title": "Pisces may struggle to trust the freedom-loving Sagittarius.",
      "content": "Pisces may struggle to trust the freedom-loving Sagittarius. While neither of these signs is particularly untrustworthy or unreliable, Sag's need for independence and solo time may create some trust issues for Pisces. Pisces may be inwardly focused, but they crave intimacy and quality time with their romantic partner, perhaps more than Sagittarius is equipped to give. This may result in some clinginess and anxiety for Pisces. Pisces needs to remember that while Sagittarius craves independence, they also respect nothing more than truth and honesty, and that their need for space isn't indicative of a lack of love or respect for their Pisces partner. [9] X Research source Sagittarius can ease some of Pisces' worries by planning frequent dates together and reassuring them before they go off alone that they'll be back again."

      "title": "Sagittarius doesn't think before speaking, and Pisces thinks too much.",
      "content": "Sagittarius doesn't think before speaking, and Pisces thinks too much. Pisces is eternally inward-facing—not selfish, mind you, just severely introspective…sometimes to a fault. Non-confrontationality is a Pisces’ M.O., meaning if they have a problem in the relationship, they may not say so. [10] X Research source Sagittarius, meanwhile…well, let’s just say they have a habit of putting their foot in their mouth. These contradictory communication styles may cause the 2 signs to butt heads from time to time. Pisces’ tendency to prioritize peace over voicing their needs may become an issue over time. They’re likely to sacrifice their own happiness if it means not getting into a fight, especially with hot-headed Sagittarius. But if they practice using their voice, and if Sagittarius practices tuning into Pisces’ emotional state to see what lies beneath the surface during discussions, these 2 will find a way to communicate their truths and hear one another out."

      "title": "They always give each other the benefit of the doubt.",
      "content": "They always give each other the benefit of the doubt. These are 2 of the most optimistic signs you’ll meet, and their tendency to look on the bright side in every situation goes a long way in a romantic relationship! Even if they struggle to communicate sometimes, their ability to give each other the benefit of the doubt in an argument means that they’ll always find a way to work through their issues."

      "title": "Their shared love of adventure and creativity make them great friends.",
      "content": "Their shared love of adventure and creativity make them great friends. In a Pisces-Sag friendship , there’s no sitting around going, “What do you want to do?” “I don’t know, what do you want to do?” These 2 are always ready for a new experience, especially ones that engage the senses and emotions. And their ability to be great friends makes a Pisces-Sag romance all the more promising. [11] X Research source Art gallery crawls, a hike in a haunted forest, a last-minute weekend trip to Niagara Falls—Pisces and Sag are always up for something new, and their endless adventures give them plenty to bond over. Sagittarius is likely to take the lead in the real-world adventures, as Pisces’ introspection means they struggle to be grounded in reality at times, and their shyness may make them hesitant to take charge. [12] X Research source In fact, for imaginative, reflective Pisces, sometimes saying home is an adventure. Pisces is way more likely than Sagittarius to crave a quiet evening at home once in a while, so in a relationship, Sagittarius will likely have to sacrifice the odd wild night out for a relaxing night of Netflix and chill.

      "content": "Pisces’ oversensitivity may clash with Sagittarius’ bluntness. An amazing relationship is possible between these 2, as long as they can make space for Pisces’ sensitivity and Sag’s brutal frankness. If they don’t go into the relationship with an awareness of one another’s communication styles and emotional fragility (or lack thereof), they may clash too much to make a partnership work. [14] X Research source Reader Poll: We asked 707 wikiHow readers what their biggest dealbreaker is as a Pisces and 62% of them said someone who lies. [Take Poll] However, it’s important for Sagittarius to avoid being too blunt so they don’t hurt Pisces’ feelings."

      "title": "Sagittarius may need more space than Pisces is comfortable with.",
      "content": "Sagittarius may need more space than Pisces is comfortable with. Both of these signs are free-spirited, but Pisces lives for human-to-human connection, while Sagittarius needs regular solo time. Sagittarius may struggle to feel independent enough in a relationship with a Pisces. However, Pisces’ abundance of empathy means they’ll likely be able to see where their Sag partner is coming from and give them the space they need . [15] X Research source While Pisces may understand and acquiesce to Sag’s need for space, Sag must be aware that Pisces will suffer in the relationship if they don’t get adequate quality time together to cultivate intimacy. If they struggle to find the balance between being together and apart, it might help to schedule time throughout the week to go on dates and spend time apart. (And Pisces, who has a tendency to cling, may benefit from solo time as well!) [16] X Research source Sagittarius can help allay any anxiety Pisces might feel about Sag’s need for space by regularly reassuring them they’re invested in the relationship."

      "title": "Pisces may lose themselves in the relationship.",
      "content": "Pisces may lose themselves in the relationship. Because Pisces are so empathic and gentle, there’s a risk that they’ll lose themselves in any romantic relationship—especially a relationship with bold, take-charge Sagittarius. If Sagittarius stays aware of their tendency to take over, and if Pisces works to use their voice and take the lead from time to time, their relationship has potential to thrive. [17] X Research source Pisces’ desire for deep connection means they celebrate a love that is all-consuming. To avoid losing their identity in their partner or falling into their partner’s orbit, they have to realize that they’re enough on their own, and that real love doesn’t mean erasing the self. [18] X Research source Sagittarius must be aware that gentle Pisces is ready and willing to be sculpted by their whims and desires, and back off a little. To make the relationship work, the Sagittarius partner needs to encourage their Pisces lover to take the lead now and again—for instance, let them pick date night once in a while."
