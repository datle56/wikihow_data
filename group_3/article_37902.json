      "content": "Play for a while before you create your own clan . It isn't advised that you start a new clan unless you're already fairly advanced, at experience level 40 and Town Hall level 9 or higher. If you aren't, almost no one will want to join, and you might be hassled and made fun of. This is an unfortunate part of that community, but you can get around the cyberbullying by joining another clan to get started and build your status. Once you've learned the ropes, have a good base , become a fairly skilled player, start your own clan, plot your domination, and execute it. One rule of thumb is that a clan should be created at Town Hall level 9 or higher. This is because if you are a clan leader, you must look powerful with your defenses and offensive power, displaying strong towers and upgraded, high-level troops such as the Electro-Dragon. Town Hall level 8 and below are considered early-game in Clash of Clans, and at level 9 things such as the powerful Archer Queen are unlocked, making you a more attractive leader. At Town Hall level 12, Siege Machines can be built, which makes you look far more attractive as a leader. Try joining a clan first. Running a clan can be a lot of work and you might not be experienced, so joining one first can help you learn the ropes."

      "content": "Decide what kind of clan you would like to run. There are three basic types of clans â€” Hardcore, Farming , and Casual clans. Planning your clan and attracting members for your new clan will be much easier if you have some plan for how you'll run things and your general strategy. A Hardcore clan, better known as a Trophy Pushing clan, is constructed around the idea of constantly warring. They mostly always have wars that go from back to back, and usually never stop, so be prepared to invest precious time. Farming clans are basically the opposite of hardcore. Farming clans rarely have wars and \"just like the name suggests\" they farm. The only point in joining a farming clan is to get high-level troops for your farming. A Casual or a Hybrid clan is basically just a combination of the two, warring usually but not always and, farming a lot on your off time."

      "content": "Come up with a great clan name. To get new members in your clan, you should come up with a clan name that will attract people and make them want to join yours above all others when new members are searching for clans to join. Unique clan names will be the only name that comes up when someone's searching for a specific term, making it critical that you avoid cliches or common types of clan names. Try to come up with something fresh and exciting, and avoid boring clan names like \"The Clash Clan\" or \"The Great Clan\" or \"We Do War.\" No thanks. Look at the most popular clan names and come up with very different types of names, names that sound like rad raider clans from the Viking days. Try out something awesome and specific, like \"Witchsmoke\" or \"Dragon Eye.\" \"Green Valkyrie\"? Now you're talking."

Be sure that your symbol is memorable and striking so that people will recognize it in an instant. A great symbol can do a lot to attract new members and strike fear into the hearts of your enemies."

      "content": "Add an interesting description of your clan. Take a while to write up a friendly bio of your clan, one that states what your clan is about. For example, if you want to be a trophy-hunting clan, put that in your bio. If you want to start a friendly or a farming clan, put that in your bio. There should be enough of substance in your description that prospective members will have something to grab onto, but not so long and involved that you might turn off casual members. Some players elect to include their clan rules in the description, while others choose to make that available later with individual clan members. Whatever you choose to do, it's up to you. You're the leader!"

      "content": "Set your class so anyone can join. At first, it'll seem hard to find enough new members to make it worth your while, but patience and persistence will pay off in the long run. The best way to seed your new clan with members is to set the clan to \"Anyone Can Join,\" to allow people to drift in and become members without vetting them first. You'll end up with a lot of scrubs, but you can always kick them out later. It's likely you will remain with around five or ten members for a while, depending on your rank. The higher you are in rank, the easier it will be to get people to join. If you're having trouble gaining members, be patient and gather players slowly by leveling up until you reach 20, which tends to be a breakthrough point. Many people will start to join and you will soon have a clan of 50 or more."

      "content": "Accept strong members. Once you've got a good base to start with, you can change the settings and start picking stronger players that will improve your clan. Make sure they have moderately strong bases and a sufficient amount of points. If you let anyone in, the member limit will be reached and you'll find that your clan doesn't have a very good ranking. It's better to start with a good foundation as a small alliance with good players, rather than a full alliance with all new players who just wanted a clan to be in. Some players like to start by offering free elder status for the first few, while others look at this as a bad way of doing business. This tends to attract \"hoppers,\" or players who only stick around for a short while and become inactive. It's better to accept and promote only strong players who'll improve your clan, not abandon it."

You can also go to global chat at mention your clan is all about war, but beware that people can lie or even find a way to sabotage your clan. Try to not recruit clan hoppers or people that will just negatively impact your clan unless you're really desperate for members. Lots of people will want the status of Elder or Co-Leader in your clan, which can make the game less fun for you when they start abusing their power. Make wise choices when promoting."

It's common to shout out your clan on the Clash of Clans Recruit Reddit forum, other message boards, and other types of chats to attract attention and gather new members into the fold. If you're the leader, it's your job to advertise and to gather new members. You might even consider making it a rule that every new member has to post in several places to keep the word about your clan spreading and keep new members joining regularly."

Give a warning that anyone who breaks any rules will be kicked out, then follow up on your punishments if it comes to that. Letting it slide once will ensure that it won't happen again in the future. You've got to rule with an iron fist. Make sure your rules can be enforced and are specific. Saying that you'll kick out anyone who's \"lazy\" is hard to understand, and can undermine your authority if one person defines laziness differently than another. Be specific in your rules and your warnings. Common rules include rules against cursing, rules that everyone needs to use both attacks and rules that everyone should participate at certain times to make clan wars a success."

Set up a defense first, and make sure to keep the storage stuff well-defended. Mortars must stay near the town hall and cannons outside those. Only attack someone you know you can handle. Single-player missions are not worth the money you'll spend to beat the money. Place weapons and walls around your most valuable property. You can also place a wall around your base to help if other people attack you. You can place army camps, barracks, and builder huts around your defenses, taking time to upgrade continually."

It's important to promote players occasionally, or people may become bored by playing with your clan and would rather be a part of a group with more responsibilities. Promote your members to elders if they are active and honest, and have been to your clan for a month at least. Promote them to co-leaders if they are trustful, or if you know the person in real life. Give all the promoted members some tasks. Don't give out free promotions, unless you're really desperate for new members. Some trolls like to join clans, become co-leaders, and then kick everyone out. No fun. Only promote people you know in real life as co-leaders to lower the risk of a coup. Kick out inactive players. Get rid of members who are not active, not participating in at least 2 or 3 wars in a row, and not donating."

If your clan gets smashed, many members will leave and find another clan. There's nothing more fun than beating the other clan by so much that you can tell your clan to go for loot, giving all your members as much as a 600k loot bonus.

Make sure you listen to your clan's input as well, especially the elders.

      "content": "Decide whether or not you'll designate co-leaders. Some players have a strict rule against promoting co-leaders, choosing to take sole control of the clan. This eliminates the possibility of coups, in which someone takes over your clan and kicks everyone out to start over. Alternatively, some players think it's an effective command strategy to gather a base of as many as three or four co-leaders that you trust and that are within 10 levels of you. If you do choose to promote players to co-leader, make sure they've played with you for a long time and have donated a sufficient number of troops to the clan. Write this into the rules so everyone can be clear on how promotions work. Offer constructive feedback. After warnings, replay some unsuccessful raids and try to tell your members how they could have done better. For example, if someone used an all-P.E.K.K.A. army, tell them to try an all-dragon army next time because it will be more effective."

You've got to prepare for the long haul and wait while you slowly gain new members. Give your new clan time and focus on building an effective defensive network and gaining new members of the clan before you rush into things. It's fun to go starting wars, but not until you've got an effective base built up, and enough clan members to make it worthwhile. Don't rush to the town hall. Beginning players tend to rush the town hall building project, which can get everything off on the wrong foot. Instead, max out everything in the store, and then you can upgrade your town hall."
