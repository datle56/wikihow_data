      "content": "Identify when there will be a solar or lunar eclipse. Solar eclipses happen when the Moon passes between the Sun and Earth, which occur around 2-5 times every year. Lunar eclipses occur when the Moon enters the shadow of Earth, which occurs only 3 times per year. Search online for a calendar of the year’s eclipses so you know when they are. [1] X Research source Lunar eclipses can last for up to 100 minutes and can only happen during a full moon. Solar eclipses can last up to 7 and a half minutes and can only happen during a new moon."

      "title": "Perform ghusl before you pray.",
      "content": "Perform ghusl before you pray. Wash your hands, arms, feet, legs, and face as normal before praying. If you’ve just woken up, are menstruating, or have had sex since the last time you prayed, wash your entire body. This will help make you body clean for the prayer. [2] X Research source If you’re not sure whether you need to do ghusl, it’s best to do more than you need to. When in doubt, wash your entire body."

      "title": "Make an intention for the prayer and say the opening takbir.",
      "content": "Make an intention for the prayer and say the opening takbir. Think about how the sun and the moon represent the different aspects of your faith, and how one of these disappearing might be frightening. Then, say “Allahu Akbar” and move into the next part of the prayer. [3] X Research source For example, a common intention for the eclipse prayer is confirming and trusting one’s faith even when it’s hard to see a higher power at work. If you’re having a hard time coming up with an intention, you can make your intention something more personal, like the health of your family and friends."

      "title": "Recite the Fatiha quietly or in your head when the eclipse starts.",
      "content": "Recite the Fatiha quietly or in your head when the eclipse starts. As with any other prayer, read or recite the opening chapter of the Qur’an. Make sure your voice is extremely quiet, especially if you’re in a Mosque. You should begin praying as soon as the eclipse begins. [4] X Research source Try not to start the Fatiha before the eclipse begins. If you can, time it as closely as possible to start when the eclipse starts."

      "content": "Recite a long surah. Pick a surah that is the around the same length as the second chapter of the Qur’an, Surah al-Baqarah, or slightly shorter. You could even choose to recite this chapter if you don’t want to choose a different one. If you’re in a mosque, recite the surah that the Imam has chosen for the prayer. [5] X Research source Make sure you’re standing for this part of the prayer, as you will soon need to start doing the movements for praying. For instance, many people choose to recite the Surah an-Nisa or the Surah al-Imran."

      "title": "Bow down in ruku position to start the first rak’ah.",
      "content": "Bow down in ruku position to start the first rak’ah. Make this first ruku longer than a usual prayer, with your back straight as you bow down. Keep your voice quiet, and recite \"Subhana Rabiyyal Adheem,” meaning “Glory be to Allah who is my Lord, the Greatest.” If you don’t want to say anything, you can simply pray silently. [6] X Research source If you’re in a mosque, listen closely to the recitation from the Imam and follow along in your head."

      "title": "Say \"Sami Allahu liman hamidah” and stand back up.",
      "content": "Say \"Sami Allahu liman hamidah” and stand back up. As you say it, slowly return to a standing position. If you’re in a mosque, follow the movements of the Imam and other congregants to know when it’s time to stand up. [7] X Research source This phrase means “Allah listens to the one who praises Him,” and is usually said after a ruku to acknowledge that God hears your prayers."

      "title": "Recite Fatiha and another surah.",
      "content": "Recite Fatiha and another surah. This is different from other prayers, when you would usually go into prostration. In Salatul Kusoof, repeat the ruku once more by restarting the prayer session. Pick a surah that isn’t as long as the one in the first ruku, such as Surah ali-Imran, or another surah that is around that same length. [8] X Research source If you’re in a mosque, listen to the Imam and follow along with the surah in your head."

      "content": "Bow for a second time, slightly shorter than the first. Enter into the second ruku of the first rak’ah. Again, recite \"Subhana Rabiyyal Adheem,” and keep your voice quiet. As a general rule, hold the position for 30-45 seconds longer than you would in your everyday prayers. [9] X Research source If you’re worshiping in the mosque, follow the Imam to see when you should bow."

Hold the position for longer than you would in a normal prayer, and then straighten your back to sit up in a kneeling position. Return to sujood after a few moments of kneeling to finish the rak’ah.

      "content": "Complete the second rak’ah as you did the first. Like the first rak’ah, make sure the second rak’ah has 2 bows, 2 standing positions, and 2 prostrations. Say the same surahs as you did in the first rak’ah, or pick different ones for this repitition. [11] X Research source In most cases, if you’re worshipping at a mosque, the second rak’ah will begin immediately and include the same surahs as the first rak’ah."

    {
      "title": "Remain sitting for the At-Tashahhud.",
      "content": "Remain sitting for the At-Tashahhud. Once you finish the final sujood of the second rak’ah, sit up into a comfortable kneeling position. Say the At-Tashahhud for both rak’ahs, which is a testimony of faith. This may be longer than you’re used to, since you are saying 1 for the testimony of faith, and another for blessings. [12] X Research source Some congregations also say a third At-Tashahhud during special prayers. If you’re worshiping alone, it’s up to you to decide how many you’d want to do. To recite the At-Tashahhud, you say: “At Tahiyyaatu lilaahi was Salawaatu wat tayibaatu As Salaamu 'alaika ayyuhan nabiyyu wa rahmatul laahi wa barakaatuh As Salaamu 'alainaa wa 'alaa 'ebaadillaahis saaliheen, Ash hadu allaa ilaah ilallaah Wa ash hadu anna Muhammadan 'abduhuu wa rasuuluh.”"

If you’re worshipping in a mosque, your neighbors might also smile and nod as you say this, as signs of peace and blessing. [13] X Research source Some people may place their hands over their heart or offer to shake hands during the Tasleem. This is a personal practice that can be common in some mosques."

      "content": "Listen to the Imam’s sermon if you’re praying at a mosque. Normally, after a special prayer, such as the Salatul Kusoof, the Imam will briefly talk about why the event is important. Be respectful and listen to the sermon to gain more insight into the significance of the eclipse. [14] X Research source Make sure to allot enough time in your day to listen to the sermon for 5-10 minutes after the prayer."
