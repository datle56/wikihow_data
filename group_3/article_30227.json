[1] X Research source Make sure each fold is creased well. You can crease the folds with your fingernail, a coin, or some other small, hard object. If you're using cardstock or another kind of thick paper, you can use something called a \"scoring tool.\" This can be a very dull knife, an empty ballpoint pen, a bone folder, or an embossing tool.

You may need to re-crease any edges that aren't crisp. You should now have three outwards-facing triangles, two of which with a central crease.

Don't let this intimidate you; pillow boxes are actually the easiest type of paper box to make. It's best to use cardstock or another type of thicker paper for these boxes. In addition to paper, you'll need scissors, a ruler, and glue. [6] X Research source You will also need a scoring tool if you use cardstock. [7] X Research source"

You can even print out a blank template that you can decorate yourself. If you choose to decorate the paper, do so before you start folding. Decorating an already-folded box is both difficult and runs the risk of collapsing it. You can also print a blank template directly onto decorative paper."

      "title": "Cut out your template.",
      "content": "Cut out your template. Using your scissors, carefully cut along the lines designated by the template. A standard pillow box template has two parallel straight sides and four curved sides. They look similar to a wide hour glass. Some may be more elaborate, but they still tend to keep a \"pillow\" shape."

      "title": "Score the fold lines.",
      "content": "Score the fold lines. For straight fold lines, line your ruler up next to the marked edges on the template to guide you. The curved fold lines will be trickier, since you'll need to freehand them. Gently run your scoring tool up and down the lines until an indent forms. Don't be so rough that you cut through the paper.

      "content": "Fold and glue the tab. Fold the second straight line inward. The skinny flap will be what holds the box together. Flip the box back over and apply glue evenly on the tab. To help glue dry faster, start by using a minimal amount of glue, just what is necessary, and make sure you are applying it onto a dry surface with no other moisture."

      "content": "Fold the curved edges inward to finish your box. Once the glue has dried, gently fold the round scored lines down towards the center of the box with your fingers. They should now form two parallel sides each shaped like a pointed oval. [10] X Research source Because of their concave shape, the edges should hold together without any additional glue. If you used thin paper, though, glue may be necessary."
