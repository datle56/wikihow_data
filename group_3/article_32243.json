      "content": "Fill in any logos or indents on the cooler with spackle. Spackle is a putty used as a filler. It hardens when it dries, so you’ll be able to paint right over it later on. Use a putty knife to fill the indents with spackle. Scrape the edge of the knife over the top of the spackle so it’s flush with the rest of the cooler. Don’t worry if it’s not perfect — you can sand it down later. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Let the spackle dry for several hours.",
      "content": "Let the spackle dry for several hours. The exact amount of time it will take the spackle to dry depends on how deep the indents you filled in were — the deeper the indents, the longer it will take to dry. After a few hours, try touching the spackle with your fingers. If it's hard and has a chalky texture, it's dry."
    },
    {
      "title": "Sand the surface",
      "content": "Sand the surface of the cooler once the spackle is dry. Sanding the cooler will make it easier for the paint to stick to it. You want to sand the cooler just enough to take away the shine and give the surface a little bit of a grit. Don’t forget to sand over the spackle, so it’s flush with the rest of the cooler. Give the cooler a hard sand using 120-grit sandpaper. This will scuff the surface enough that the primer will be able to adhere to the surface of the cooler. [2] X Expert Source Patrick Coye Painting Specialist Expert Interview. 22 July 2020. For a smoother finish, start sanding the cooler with a coarse grit sandpaper (40-50 grit) and finish with a fine grit sandpaper (120-220 grit). Using 2 kinds of sandpaper will help you make your cooler as smooth as possible. [3] X Research source If the cooler came with a smooth finish, you still want to sand it down to remove the top layer of the plastic so the paint sticks."

[4] X Expert Source Patrick Coye Painting Specialist Expert Interview. 22 July 2020. Spray the primer on the cooler so there’s an even coat over the entire surface. You can find a spray-on plastic primer at your local home improvement center or paint store. If the cooler has handles or wheels that you don’t want to paint, cover them with painter’s tape before you spray the primer on."

      "content": "Let the cooler dry in a well-ventilated area for 24 hours. Place the cooler on a tarp or sheets of newspaper while it dries so the primer doesn't get on your floor. After 24 hours, the cooler should feel dry to the touch. If it's not, let it finish drying."

      "content": "Paint the cooler background with acrylic paint. Before you add designs or personal touches, you should create a solid base to work on. Cover the sides and top of the cooler with paint using a large paintbrush. To use multiple colors for the background, paint 1 color at a time and let the paint dry in between colors. One coat of acrylic paint should be enough for the background. For a harder finish, try using enamel paint, rather than acrylic.

While you can definitely draw designs on the cooler freehand, using designs printed off the computer will make the cooler look cleaner and more professional.

If you want to do multiple colors in the same design, do 1 color at a time and let the paint dry in between colors — otherwise, the colors might smudge together. It may be easier if you lay the cooler on its side so the side you're painting is facing up. If you do this, you'll need to paint 1 side at a time and let the paint dry in between sides."
