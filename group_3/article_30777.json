      "content": "Come up with a compelling reason to meet the president. Most citizens don't have direct access to the president. However, sometimes the president will meet with you if you have a very specific reason for wanting to talk to them. For instance, you might have a big idea or maybe you've been personally affected by a policy they've implemented. Think long and hard about how you can make yourself stand out. For instance, maybe you have a child who's in the military overseas so you want to talk to the president about veteran healthcare. Being the face of a bad policy, such as poor veteran healthcare, may help you get to see the president. [1] X Research source Alternatively, maybe you're a kid who has a big idea you want to share!"

      "content": "Befriend a family member of the president. While getting close to a family member of the president won't be easy, you'll likely have more direct access to one of them than the president. For instance, if you happen to go to the same college as one of the president's kids, you might try joining a club they're in. Most of the time, the president's kids also have security details, so it may not be too easy to befriend them if you don't already know them. Plus, there's a thin line between trying to befriend someone and stalking them. Don't stake out the person's dorm, for instance. If they find out you're just making friends to meet the president, they probably won't appreciate it much."
