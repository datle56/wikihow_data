      "content": "Choose a good name for your channel. Think of a name not many people will use, but will easily remember. If it's inappropriate, you'll have a bad image. You can choose to use your real name if you'd like, or you can make up a good one yourself. Just remember once you've decided it may take a while before you can change that username again. For example, if you decided on the name \"Ready Spaghetti\" and then realized it to be a bad choice you might have to wait up to three months to change that name. So choose wisely."

      "title": "Remember to make a cool username and a catchy channel name.",
      "content": "Remember to make a cool username and a catchy channel name. You don't want it to be like any other channel so be creative and make a totally new one that nobody but yourself could think of. Be aware of potential misunderstandings. For example, the word \"artistic\" sounds a lot like \"autistic,\" especially if you have a British accent. Unless both words apply to you, you might want to choose something different. Avoid saying \"channel\" in your channel name. Just like \"Star Wars\" sounds cooler than \"Star Wars: The Movie,\" it's better if you leave out the word \"channel.\" For example, \"Brad's Math Channel\" sounds less professional than \"Math with Brad\" or \"Brad the Math Man.\" Try puns and rhymes. For example, if your name is Jane Doe and you're an artist, you could name your channel Jane Doe the Art Pro, PicassDoe, or Doe Vinci."

      "content": "Add channel art . This is an image that is seen at the top of your channel page. YouTube will show examples of how the image will be displayed on the website, a TV, or a mobile device. Try to put the focus of the picture in the middle; when your channel is viewed on a mobile device, the sides of the picture will be cut off. You don't want to be left with half your face! Choose art that grabs viewers' attention. It should be 2560 x 1440 pixels, and it must be relevant to your channel's message. Include your channel's name or a message in the channel art. This will help solidify your name in the viewer's mind. Change your channel art regularly. Unless you want to set a brand image by keeping the same picture, consider regularly changing your channel art about what content you are releasing in your channel. For example, if you are doing comedy sketches, change the channel art so that it relates to your current set of sketches. You don't need Photoshop. GIMP, Picmonkey, Pixlr, and Krita are examples of programs you can use to draw for free. Don't steal art. Never take someone else's work without permission. Use free stock photos or draw your own."

You may have the funniest skit in the world, but nobody is going to watch it if they can't hear or see you properly. If you are making a YouTube video for a gaming channel, you will need a recording software. There are many recording software out there, Bandicam being one of the most popular.

Look up tutorials on how to perform basic editing functions. There are a variety of free and open source video editors available online. Many of these contain the same features or similar features as expensive professional editing software. For beginners, feel free to get acquainted with the free software that comes with your computer. For Macs, iMovie and for Windows, it's the Windows Movie Maker. After you become acquainted with these interfaces and the technology behind them, you can progress to more complicated and more powerful software. If you use music, it will have to be Non-copyright music, or music with permission of the maker."

The longer viewers watch your video, the higher YouTube will rank your videos on search results. Show a teaser of clips from the video that the viewer is about to watch. Make sure that your personality is front and center from the start of the video. Talk directly to the audience. Introduce the video personally, quickly discussing what to expect (don't give away your twist if you have one!). If you've built a brand, such as your name or a series that you are creating, make sure that is distinct and professional looking at the start of your video. When making a nonfiction video, such as a review or tutorial, make sure that the purpose of the video is clear at the very beginning. This will keep viewers from looking for another, more informative video."

Examine your programming and determine which events are tent-pole events for your audience. Create videos leading up to the event to capitalize on pre-event searches. As anticipation grows for an event, more and more people will be searching for related content. Create videos during the event to cover it as it is happening. This is great for viewers that can't otherwise experience the event themselves. Create follow-up videos after the event. Use this time to summarize what happened and analyze any information. Interact with your viewers throughout the process to keep them coming back to your channel. During big events, increase the amount of content you release to continue capitalizing on new viewers. More content shows viewers that you are knowledgeable and passionate about the event."

Make sure that your tags apply to your video, but also make sure that you aren't using the same tags as everyone else in your genre. Try to narrow down your appeal to a few keywords when coming up with tags. For example, instead of tagging your video as “singing”, narrow it down to the style: “blues singing”, “country singing”, “freestyle rapping”, etc. You can tag videos any way that you think people will search for it. Your tags should thoroughly describe the content of your video. Use a mixture of broad and specific tags. For example, if you are making a short comedy film about ninjas, use the tags “short film”, “ninjas”, “funny”, “martial arts”, “action”, “fighting”, “silly”, etc. You can use tags to create “sets” of videos. Create a unique tag and then apply it to each video that you want to keep together. This will lead to more clicks through to your related videos."

Think of it like a TV show; everyone looks forward to a new episode of their favorite show, and they know exactly when it will be coming. Try to update weekly or every other week."

Viewers that feel that the content creator cares about them will be more inclined to return and watch more content, as well as tell others about it. Spend a few hours after uploading a video responding to the comments that viewers make about it. These viewers are your most die-hard fans because they are the ones eagerly anticipating the release of new content and are brave enough to comment on it. Treat them with respect, and you will see their numbers grow. Moderate the comments on your page as much as possible. While reading nasty comments can be funny, they detract from your channel and drive viewers away. Remove comments that would offend others and report abusive users. This will help create a friendlier environment for your regular viewers. Pose questions to your viewers. Try to keep the questions simple, such as Yes/No questions or “Voting” questions. This will keep negative feedback down and promote good discussion amongst your viewers."

This will help your channel show up on searches as related viewing. Try to maintain a schedule for adding other links to other videos. Curate your linked and liked videos on days that you are not uploading your own videos. This will help break up the wait between your videos, keeping your viewers active on your channel.
