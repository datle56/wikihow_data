      "title": "Non-attachment is the understanding that everything in life is temporary.",
      "content": "Non-attachment is the understanding that everything in life is temporary. Those who practice non-attachment accept that relationships, material possessions, and life itself are ultimately fleeting. They fully enjoy these gifts of life in the moment and accept them for what they are instead of clinging to them or forcing them to be a certain way (attachment) or distancing themselves from them in an attempt to minimize the pain of inevitable loss (detachment). [1] X Research source When you accept that everything must pass, you can allow yourself to fully experience your life, riding the movement of your emotions without being held back by them. For example, perhaps you’re scared of losing a significant other, so you hold them too close or are afraid to show them who you really are. But this ultimately damages the relationship, making them feel suffocated or even distant. Someone who practices non-attachment, though, might accept that they can’t control every aspect of the relationship, and instead would enjoy it for what it is, being honest, taking risks, and accepting surprises as they come, good or bad."

      "content": "Non-attachment has its origins in many Eastern religions. Buddhists often practice non-attachment as a way to prevent the material world from distracting them from living a holy life. [2] X Trustworthy Source Science Direct Online archive of peer-reviewed research on scientific, technical and medical topics Go to source This is summed up in the concept of “Zen,” or “no thought.” Other religions also incorporate non-attachment, like Taoism, Hinduism, and Jainism."

      "title": "Meditate daily, focusing on the present moment.",
      "content": "Meditate daily, focusing on the present moment. Meditation asks you to focus solely on the here and now, letting go of worries about the past or future. These thoughts are attachments that are drawing you away from your center. To work at releasing them, find some time each day to be alone in a quiet space. Try to meditate for at least 10 minutes initially, but extend this time by a minute or 2 each time you meditate. Focus on your breathing and your body, and avoid outside thoughts. [3] X Research source Sit or lie down, breathe deeply, and close your eyes. Focus on just existing, breathing, and letting the moment take its course. Download meditation apps like Headspace or Calm to assist you if you are a beginner."

      "title": "Identify your expectations, then let them go.",
      "content": "Identify your expectations, then let them go. Georgoulis tells us that many people have “such unrealistic expectations about what it means to be a human being.” A fundamental aspect of non-attachment is freedom from expectations. It is often our expectations that cause us to be disappointed in others. When someone breaks plans or trust with you, don’t focus on your disappointment or anger, and don’t dwell on why this person did such a thing. Focus only on what you can do. Let go of the control they had over your happiness. For example, you may expect your friends or romantic partners to be perfect, even if you don’t realize it. Part of non-attachment is pausing and realizing that nobody is perfect, and you must accept them as they are. If you’re ever worried, nervous, excited, or scared of a situation, take note of these feelings, ask yourself why you feel that way, then remind yourself that you can’t know how things will go until they’ve already happened."

      "content": "Use grounding exercises to help you stay calm and present. Grounding is a practice used by many therapists and psychiatrists to help people stay rooted in the present and aware of the world around them. Another part of non-attachment is staying calm and in control of your emotions. Any time you feel anxious, adrift, or overwhelmed, take a few deep breaths and ask yourself these questions: [4] X Trustworthy Source University of Rochester Medical Center Leading academic medical center in the U.S. focused on clinical care and research Go to source What are 5 things I can see around me?

      "content": "Question your own ethics and morals. As much as is possible, conduct yourself with integrity. But just like with everything else, don’t feel like your ethics or morals are always correct, and accept that they may need to shift. Be honest with others, keep your promises, and don’t steal or hurt others. Focus on taking care of yourself, but not at the expense of others. When in doubt, ask yourself: [5] X Research source Is there another way to look at this? Would another person have a different perspective? Do my actions spread happiness? Or do my actions only make me happy? Would I want someone else to do this to or for me? What evidence do I have that this is true?"

      "title": "Keep a journal of your thoughts.",
      "content": "Keep a journal of your thoughts. Like mediation, journaling helps you keep track of your thoughts and emotions and makes it easier to identify your attachments. Each night before bed, take a few minutes to write about your day. Write about any difficulties or successes you had or moments you felt clingy. Choosing to focus on how your day went will help you take your focus off of others.

Your relationship to non-attachment will grow, shift, and change the more you practice and learn about it, and that’s a good thing! If you can, find other people who practice non-attachment, like groups, clubs, or spiritual organizations, and discuss your thoughts.

      "title": "Admit that you don’t know everything.",
      "content": "Admit that you don’t know everything. Part of being non-attached means recognizing that you don’t have all the answers, and that your own thoughts and beliefs can and should change. [8] X Research source One of the biggest ways you can do this is by accepting and admitting when you don’t know something. If you pretend to know everything, you’ll never truly learn. Never get too comfortable feeling like you’re the “expert or you know it all,” Tura says, “because there's something you can always attempt to see through a beginner's mind.” If someone asks a question and you’re not sure of the answer, say, “I don’t know, but I’m excited to look into it now that you’ve asked!”"

      "content": "Stay busy even when things are changing. When life is unpredictable, it can also be pretty uncomfortable. That discomfort can paralyze you and grind things to a halt, even as the world keeps turning around you. Instead of staying frozen, find something to do! Fall back on your routines, dive into a new project, or hang out with friends. [9] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source This helps you stay on your feet. That said, you don’t have to be constantly busy.

      "content": "Make a change to your surroundings to practice your own agency. Though you can’t control others, you can control yourself and your reactions. If you have recently detached yourself from something or someone, make other changes in your life. Cut your hair or reorganize furniture. Declutter your space or get a puppy. Do something to shift your focus to something new. [10] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source This will help you get used to change as a part of life and even embrace it, which will make it easier for you to stop clinging to things and people. Stay aware of changes to your life by journaling. After a while, go back and read old journal entries to see how far you’ve come and to prove to yourself that you can adapt and still be happy. Tura says that when you’re in a tough spot, think, “Let's see what I can do to either alter it, accept it, create it, shape it.”"

      "content": "Find humor in the moment, and look on the bright side. When bad things happen, we often get stuck in self-pity or enjoy feeling sorry for ourselves, but that’s just an attachment to those negative feelings. Stop that cycle by asking yourself what the positives are. There’s always a silver lining, and finding the silver lining will make you happier and healthier. [11] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Medical School Harvard Medical School's Educational Site for the Public Go to source For example, if a dear friend is moving away, it’s okay to miss them, but consider that this is a new adventure for them, and a great excuse for you to have new adventures by visiting their new home."

      "title": "Remember that life itself is temporary.",
      "content": "Remember that life itself is temporary. Many people who practice non-attachment remind themselves: “Memento mori.” It’s a Latin phrase that means, “remember you must die.” It can seem like a little bit of a downer, but it’s actually the opposite! When you consider that life itself is fleeting, and you only have a few precious moments on Earth, it can make your problems seem small or trivial. [12] X Research source That’s what non-attachment is all about. Write the phrase somewhere you can see it every day, like on a bookmark or in a notebook, to remind yourself."

      "title": "Set boundaries in your relationships.",
      "content": "Set boundaries in your relationships. Being non-attached doesn’t mean being detached from others completely. It means that you value your relationship with yourself just as much as you value your relationships with others. “When entering into a new relationship, begin by setting solid boundary lines and do not allow yourself to leap over them,” Brown suggests. Set clear boundaries with partners, family, and friends so that you can both have respect and space. For instance, give your partners and friends some space. Don’t blow your spouse’s phone up if they aren’t answering; wait to be called back."

      "title": "Respect their privacy.",
      "content": "Respect their privacy. Everyone needs their own privacy, even best friends or people in romantic relationships. Avoid the urge to snoop on their social media or devices, and don’t feel the need to ask for or give the passwords to your phone, email, or social media. Maintain your own privacy by keeping some things to yourself unless they need to be shared with your partner. [13] X Research source Clear communication is the easiest way to practice privacy. When you’re both open with each other, you become less suspicious and clingy, because you trust each other to make the right choices, even when you’re apart."

      "title": "Spend some time without them.",
      "content": "Spend some time without them. Don’t feel the need to call or text them all day; live your life! “Be respectful of their time and your own time,” Brown tells us. You’re both individuals with your own lives, so respect that. Hang out with friends without them, sometimes. Don’t feel the need to be with your partner or friends every day. When you’re only hanging out with 1 person, it’s much easier to get attached, and you end up feeling worse when they’re not there."

      "content": "Address issues as they arise instead of tiptoeing around them. Non-attachment means not being attached to your conflicts or resentments, too. It’s best to clear up disagreements ASAP, so you’re not stewing in them. Should an issue arise between you and someone you are feeling attached to, address it. Find a non-busy time for the two of you to talk to hash it out. Be respectful and honest. Listen to their points and try to understand their perspective.

      "title": "Compromise when you don’t agree.",
      "content": "Compromise when you don’t agree. If you’re trying to force your point of view onto another person, that means you’re too attached to it. Avoid trying to make others see and do things your way all the time. Let go of your need to control them or their actions. Instead, find areas of compromise so that you can both get some things that you want. [15] X Research source For instance, you might want more time with a partner, but they might want more space. Agree on a certain number of nights per week to see each other."

      "content": "Realize when it’s time to let someone go. Sometimes, non-attachment means letting go of a relationship that’s not serving you. You can’t and shouldn’t have to make someone stay with you. Also, you shouldn’t stay in a relationship that hurts you. [16] X Research source Even if you feel super close to someone, they might decide one day that they want something different, or you might. Though it’s hard, it’s going to be okay. Never beg someone to be with you; state your feelings calmly and let them go. If someone wants to break up and you don’t, say, “I don’t want to break up, but I understand where you are coming from. I’m sad that the relationship is ending, but I wish you the best.”"

      "content": "You wish things would stay the same. This is an attachment to the present moment. You feel comfortable and safe with the way things are, and fear things changing because it might make you uncomfortable. But everything is constantly changing anyway, and so you experience a sharp anxiety or grief as things come and go. [17] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source This applies to your career, relationships, jobs, and possessions.

When they don’t, it feels like you’ve been let down, or that life is unfair and working against you. [18] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source But life is unpredictable by nature, and rarely obeys our expectations."

Maybe you expect the worst, or maybe the fact that it’s unclear and hazy causes you anxiety. [19] X Research source The thing about the future, though, is that it’s never very predictable, meaning you’re always stressed by the thought of it. This applies to the past, as well. You have regrets or resentments about the way things happened, or like you wish you could go back, and you feel attached to those emotions. But you can’t change the past, so there’s no use clinging to it."

You might feel like you know exactly who you are: you believe this , you do things this way, this is where you come from, this is where you’re going. But the “self,” or your identity, isn’t just a container for your beliefs and possessions. It’s a constantly changing thing that adapts to your environment. [20] X Research source If your sense of self is too rigid, then you risk cutting yourself off from new opportunities that you might not think “someone like you” would have or do. One way to change this is to think in terms of “sometimes.” For example, instead of thinking, “I’m bad at this,” think, “I sometimes struggle with this,” to make it less about your own identity."
