      "title": "Lay out the rope.",
      "content": "Lay out the rope. In tug of war, opposing player or teams will pull on a rope until one of the teams or players succeeds at pulling the majority of the rope over to one side. To get started, all you need to do is take your rope and lay it out in a straight line on the ground. There should be a flag or marker in the center of the rope. If not, then place one in the center of your rope before you start the game."
    },
    {
      "title": "Place the opponents.",
      "content": "Place the opponents. You can play tug of war in teams or as a one-on-one game. If you are going to have a team game, then make sure that you have an equal number of players on either side of the rope. If you are playing with just two people, then stand at opposite ends of the rope."
    },
    {
      "title": "Grip the rope.",
      "content": "Grip the rope. Have all of the players pick up the rope and grip it tightly with both hands. Do this before you start the game so that everyone has a chance to get a good grip on the rope. Never anchor the rope around your waist or coil it around other parts of your body. This can result in severe rope burn, dislocations, or rope breaks that can snap and inflict other severe or even fatal injuries. [2] X Research source [3] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Place the judge in the center.",
      "content": "Place the judge in the center. If you have not chosen a judge yet, then do so now. The judge can be someone who does not want to play or an extra person if you have an odd number of players. Have the judge stand in the center of the rope. The judge will also need a whistle (or a loud voice) to signal to other players that the game has started."
    },
    {
      "title": "Sound a whistle.",
      "content": "Sound a whistle. The judge can blow a whistle or yell “Go!” to signal to the players that the game has started. Have the judge signal the start of the game so that the players will know when to start pulling. When the judge sounds the whistle or yells, then the game has officially started."
    },
    {
      "title": "Pull as hard as you can.",
      "content": "Pull as hard as you can. All players on either side should lean backwards with their feet planted as they pull to start. Try to use your body weight and leg strength to pull the rope back and away from the other team."
    },
    {
      "title": "Keep pulling until there is a victor.",
      "content": "Keep pulling until there is a victor. Each team’s goal is to pull the marker or flag past the center point. When one team or player has accomplished this goal, that team or player will be declared the winner. Don’t stop pulling until the judge declares a winner."
    },
    {
      "title": "Pick the right rope.",
      "content": "Pick the right rope. You will need to have a good strong rope to play tug of war. The rope should be free of knots, fraying, or any flaws that might allow extra holding or rubbing. You may want to select a nylon rope to reduce rope-burn incidents. [4] X Research source Make sure that the rope is long enough to accommodate all of your players as well. All of the players should have room to grip the rope and stand beside it."
    },
    {
      "title": "Mark the rope.",
      "content": "Mark the rope. You will need to place a marker in the center of the rope so that players will be able to find the center. Find the center of the rope and mark it with one color flag or marker. Make sure the rope is straight when you measure it to find the center. [5] X Research source You may also want to place markers on both sides of the central marker to indicate where players should start holding the rope. Place these markers about three feet away from the center point on both sides of the rope."
    },
    {
      "title": "Chalk up your hands.",
      "content": "Chalk up your hands. Resin is an optional way to enhance your grip on the rope. Use resin or chalk from a sporting goods store or department store. Take out a palm full of the substance and clap or rub it between your palms. Work the substance around and between your fingers as well. This isn’t common in casual tug of war games, but can help you hold onto the rope for more organized games."
    },
    {
      "title": "Choose a dry, level playing ground.",
      "content": "Choose a dry, level playing ground. It can be fun to play tug of war on a slippery, muddy terrain, but this may also make it harder to win based on strength. If you want to play a fair game of tug of war, then choose a level, dry playing ground, such as a dry field or the floor of a gymnasium."
    },
    {
      "title": "Choose comfortable clothing.",
      "content": "Choose comfortable clothing. While you can wear just about anything you want for such a casual game you might want something more athletic. You might consider wearing shorts, or sweat pants. These are going to be more flexible than other forms of outwear for your legs. A t-shirt will be more likely to flex with your movements as you play the game. Whatever you choose to wear you should expect it to get dirty if you fall."
    },
    {
      "title": "Pick the right shoes for indoors or outdoors.",
      "content": "Pick the right shoes for indoors or outdoors. Consider where you will be playing tug of war before you pick your shoes. If you are paying a game of tug of war indoors, then a regular pair of sneaker should be fine. If playing outside, you may want to choose a pair of sneakers with rubber cleats or even go for a pair of boots if the terrain is muddy. Avoid metal cleats, steel toes, and shoes that have metal anywhere else on the sole. These types of shoes pose a hazard to your fellow players."

    {
      "title": "Wear padding if available.",
      "content": "Wear padding if available. This is optional, but it is a good idea. You should consider wearing head gear, knee pads, and elbow pads. These are the areas you are most likely to fall on and injure during a tug of war contest. While most casual games of tug of war don’t require any padding you can still opt to put on protection to reduce the chance for injury. You can find rubber and plastic padding in any sport shop and many department stores."
