They will first apply a local anesthetic to the cyst so you do not feel the procedure. [4] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Then, they will make a small incision in the cyst and drain the contents by “expressing” the fluid. “Expressing” means they will apply a small amount of pressure on the cyst to push the fluid out. The fluid in the cyst may appear yellow or cheesy looking and have an unpleasant smell. Your doctor may also remove the cyst wall to prevent the cyst from appearing again. This is considered minor surgery and your doctor may need to give the area sutures once the cyst wall has been removed, depending on how big the cyst is. Removing the cyst is generally done after the acute infection has subsided to prevent recurrence of an infected cyst."
