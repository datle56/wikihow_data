      "content": "In the Norse creation story, life came from water falling into an abyss. According to Norse mythology, there were once two worlds sitting on either side of a bottomless abyss called Ginnungagap. One of these worlds was a land of ice (“Niflheim”) and the other was a land of fire (“Muspelheim”). Over time, each of these worlds grew stronger and they competed with one another for space. As the two worlds clashed and fought, the combination of fire and ice created water droplets that fell into Ginnungagap and created life. This first life was called Ymir, a giant that was half male and half female. [35] X Research source"

Namely, these beings evolved into what we now know as the first Norse gods: Odin, Vili, and Vé. These gods conspired together to kill Ymir, using the giant’s own blood, teeth, hair, and bones to create the Nordic mythological universe—including Asgard, Hel, the mortal world, and other divine realms.

      "content": "The original gods and their offspring split into two groups: Æsir and Vanir. These two groups—which are often referred to as “houses” or “families”—were necessary to provide all that was needed for life to exist. The Æsir house focused more on battle, war, bravery, loyalty, and strength. Its most important gods and goddesses include Odin, Frigg, Thor, Loki, Balder, Hod, Heimdall, and Tyr. The Vanir house, on the other hand, ruled primarily over magic, fertility, wealth, and commerce. Njord, Freyr, and Freyja are the most notable Vanir gods. [37] X Research source While it was understood that the coexistence of both houses was necessary in order to have balance in the universe, conflict and battles still regularly occurred between the two groups."

After these stories evolved and were developed throughout the Germanic and Viking eras, they were eventually recorded in Old Norse—a language spoken by ancient Norse peoples in modern Scandinavia (e.g., Iceland, Norway, Sweden, Denmark, and Greenland). The primary written sources for Norse mythology are the Poetic Edda (written in 1250 by an anonymous author) and the Prose Edda (written in 1220 by Snorri Sturluson). [38] X Research source"

Asgard itself was divided into 12 separate realms in which the gods lived and worked. The realms included Valhalla, where Odin lived, Thrudheim, where Thor lived, Breidablik, where Balder lived, and many others. Each important Norse god and goddess had their own palace within Asgard.

Odin was the chief god and king of the Æsir, and he also fathered Thor—the god of thunder and one of the most physically strong and powerful gods in Norse mythology. Freyja, a key goddess, was a fierce warrior who would lead the Valkyries into battle. She also oversaw love, beauty, fertility, and war. However, there are many other supremely strong and powerful Norse gods besides these three. Some include Balder, Loki, Hel, Tyr, Heimdall, Vidar, and Vale."
