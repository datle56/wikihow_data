      "content": "Remove the laces from your boots to access their entire surface. Having easy access to the entire surface of your boots is important for creating an even shine. To create a sturdier space to work on, you can insert shoe trees into your boots. Shoe trees can be replaced by wadding up a newspaper and inserting it into the toe of your boot. [1] X Research source For boots with taller necks, wad up some old t-shirts or towels and pack them tightly into the neck of your boots. This will make the necks easier to handle as you polish."

      "content": "Use your horsehair brush to clean any debris from your boots. This step should always be done before you begin polishing. Even if your boots do not appear to be incredibly dirty, they may still be covered with dust and small debris that may be hard to see. If you just polish over that, you're actually working that dirt deeper into your boots. [2] X Expert Source Penny Simmons Shoe Care Specialist Expert Interview. 19 November 2020. Start by gently brushing your boot’s surface. Pay close attention to any areas of dirt, dust, and other debris. Make sure that the debris is completely removed before continuing."

      "content": "Use saddle soap if your boots need a deeper clean. Dip a damp cloth in saddle soap and rub that into your shoes. If you don't have any saddle soap, use just a little baby shampoo mixed with a small amount of water. Either way, make sure not to saturate your shoe when you're cleaning it, as that will damage the leather. [3] X Expert Source Penny Simmons Shoe Care Specialist Expert Interview. 19 November 2020. Use a welt brush and a dab of water to reach smaller areas and openings in your boot such as the eyelets and the welts. However, do not soak your boot when applying the water. Allow your shoes 10-15 minutes to dry before continuing, and make sure every area of your shoe has dried completely."

Make sure to take the proper precautions before applying your polish and save yourself the potential frustration of dealing with a stained kitchen table.

      "title": "Use a cream or wax based polish.",
      "content": "Use a cream or wax based polish. These will provide better nourishment and coloring for your boots. Wax based polishes have a higher concentration of hard wax that will create a better shine. Because of the stronger concentration of wax, this type of polish will help you protect your boots from liquids, scratches, and scuffs. [5] X Research source For oil-tanned leather, use an oil or conditioner for polishing. Simply use a clean cloth, dab it into the oil or conditioner, and lightly spread it thoroughly across your boot. Oil-tanned leather will have been treated with oil to help make the boots more resistant to various types of weather. [6] X Research source When treating suede or rough out based leather, do not use oil, polish, or conditioner, as it is not needed. Use a leather protector spray instead."

      "content": "Use a small, circular motion to apply your polish. Begin applying the polish to one small area, such as the toe of your boot, at a time. This will ensure that you are not missing any scuffs or scrapes that could possibly be overlooked. Continue to use small, circular motions as you apply polish to the remaining area of your boot, re-saturating your cloth with polish as needed. [8] X Research source Only apply a very thin layer of the polish to your shoes—if you put on too much, it's just going to sit on the surface of the leather, and it's not going to soak in. [9] X Expert Source Penny Simmons Shoe Care Specialist Expert Interview. 19 November 2020. Using a circular motion will help the wax or cream to spread evenly over the surface of your boot."

      "content": "Make sure to polish the welts of your shoes. To do so, dip a welt brush or toothbrush into the polish. Apply the polish to your boot using small, circular motions, when able to. This brush will also come in handy when you are ready to polish the heel and other small areas. [10] X Research source The welt strip is a piece of leather that is used to attach the insole and outsole of your boots.

Wrap a clean piece of a cotton cloth securely around your index finger, molding it as close to the outline of your finger as you can. Add the water to the tip of the cloth on your finger.

      "content": "Add a small amount of wax to the damp cloth on your fingertip. The smaller amount of wax you use here, the better.

      "content": "Use a small, quick circular motion to apply the wax. You will want to have a very light touch while applying the wax. If you press too hard during application, you could be rubbing off any polish that has not yet been completely dissolved. Instead, you want to use the small amount of wax to create a light, smooth coat over the hardened polish. Do not worry if there is an increase in friction between your finger and your boot along with a matted or cloudy texture. This only means that the wax is beginning to harden and you will want to continue shaping it into a smooth layer. If needed, you can add a drop of water to the hardening wax and continue to massage it with light, circular motions. Continue to add one drop of water at a time until the matted texture disappears."

If you don’t allow your wax to dry thoroughly, it will prevent the wax from building a protective layer. Allowing the wax time to dry is particularly important if you plan to apply another layer."

      "content": "Reapply the wax until you achieve your desired level of shine. Even when reapplying the wax, make sure to follow the previous steps exactly. Applying too much wax will create a hard surface that will not result in a shiny finish. Be patient during this process. Depending on the state of your boots, they may take more applications of wax for your desired outcome. Don’t rush the process, as rushing through the steps will not help you get your desired finish."
