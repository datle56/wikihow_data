      "title": "Separate your sets and runs from your extra cards.",
      "content": "Separate your sets and runs from your extra cards. Check your existing hand for matching sets and runs. Put aside your sets, or matching number cards (e.g., three 7 cards, four King cards), and your runs, or sequential suit cards (e.g., 5, 6, and 7 of diamonds). Continue drawing and discarding cards throughout the game to match as many sets and runs as possible. [1] X Research source When you can, try to form a merged set and sequence with 6 cards. For instance, a set including a 6 of hearts, a 6 of clubs, and a 6 of spades can be combined with a 7, 8, and 9 of spades."

      "title": "Calculate the total value of your unmatched numbered cards.",
      "content": "Calculate the total value of your unmatched numbered cards. Take a look at the cards in your hand that have no matches. Start by adding your numbered cards together. In the case of gin rummy, all number cards are self-explanatory in value. [2] X Research source For example, a 10 card is worth 10 points, a 9 card is worth 9 points, and so on."

    {
      "title": "Count the value of your unmatched face cards.",
      "content": "Count the value of your unmatched face cards. Separate any face and ace cards in your hand so you can add their point totals together. Count each face card (e.g., Jack, Queen, King) as 10 points, while aces can be counted as 1 point. Combine this number with the total value of your unmatched number cards. Keep track of this number value throughout each round. [3] X Research source These unmatched cards are also known as “deadwood.”"

      "title": "Knock on your turn when the total of your unmatched cards is under 10.",
      "content": "Knock on your turn when the total of your unmatched cards is under 10. Continue the game by drawing a card into your hand and discarding another. Create as many sets and runs as possible throughout the round until your deadwood is equal to or less than 10 points. At this point, rap on the table to signify that you’re ready to see your opponent’s cards. [4] X Research source Knocking just means that one player is comfortable enough with their hand to try and score points against their opponent. After knocking, the player must reveal the sets and runs they have so far."

    {
      "title": "Let your opponent add their cards to your sets and runs.",
      "content": "Let your opponent add their cards to your sets and runs. Give the other player a moment to add some of their unmatched cards to your existing sets and runs. Before both players add up and compare their deadwood totals, the opponent can get rid of some of their unmatched cards ahead of time, when applicable. [5] X Research source For example, if you have a set of three 4 cards and your opponent has the last remaining 4 card in their deadwood, they can add that card to your set."

    {
      "title": "Subtract your unmatched card total from the opponent’s card total.",
      "content": "Subtract your unmatched card total from the opponent’s card total. Examine your opponent’s cards and add their unmatched number and face cards together. Subtract your deadwood total from your opponent’s, assuming that the other player has a larger total. In this case, the difference of both scores is added to your point total for the round. [6] X Research source An underknock occurs when the opponent’s card total is less than the knocker’s. In this case, the difference is added to the opponents score, and this player also receives an extra 10 points as bonus. For example, if you knock with a deadwood total of 7 points, that number would be subtracted from your opponent’s deadwood total. If your opponent has a deadwood total of 35, then you’d get 28 points for the round."

      "content": "Add a bonus to your score if you knock with gin. Knock against your opponent when you’ve matched all of your cards into runs and sets, which is otherwise known as “going gin.” When you go gin, you automatically get a bonus, in addition to your opponent’s deadwood total. To make the game run more smoothly, decide ahead of time what the gin bonus will be. [7] X Research source Most games have the gin bonus be 20 points. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Tally up any bonuses throughout the game. Keep score throughout the game, and pause once a player gets a total of 100 points. At this point, add an additional 100 points to that player’s score. If the player has shut out their opponent, then they get a 200 point bonus instead. At this point, both players can add an extra 20 points to their score for every round they’ve won. [9] X Research source Whoever reaches the established point total first (e.g., 250) wins the game."
