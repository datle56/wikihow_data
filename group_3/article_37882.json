      "content": "Eat the right diet. By improving your eating habits, you will decrease your body fat and fatigue, while gaining muscle and endurance. Not eating right could be what is holding you back from breaking your 800m record. Eat a variety of wholesome foods like fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean meats. [1] X Trustworthy Source American Heart Association Leading nonprofit that funds medical research and public education Go to source This will improve your body composition. Increase protein and the right amount of carbohydrates, as these will provide your body with the nutrients to build muscle and to give your body energy. If you’re training for 30-45 minutes, shoot for about 3 grams (0.11 oz) of carbs on training days. If you’re training for 46-60 minutes, shoot for about 5 grams (0.18 oz) of carbs on training days. Avoid processed high-sugar and high-sodium foods. These will hinder your body from running efficiently. Eat the right pre and post-workout carbohydrate-rich snacks. These should be consumed an hour before working out and within 30 minutes after a workout. Bananas, protein shakes and non-caffeinated energy bars are ideal."

Your body needs about two liters on an average day to stay properly hydrated. [3] X Research source On days when running, you need to drink extra water to compensate for your output and prevent yourself from slowing down. Don’t just chug extra water though; listen to your body and drink when thirsty. Pre and post-workout hydration is vital. An hour before you start your run, try to drink about 16 ounces (450 g) of water. Drink the same amount of water after running. Look for signs of dehydration. Feeling thirsty or experiencing dry mouth, headaches, light-headedness, lack of urination and constipation are all the body's ways of letting you know that you are dehydrated.

By stretching properly, you can improve your stride and your stride length (increasing your speed). Stretching before and after your workout will also help to prevent injury. [6] X Research source Muscles to stretch include your leg muscles (hamstrings, quadriceps and adductors) and your lower body (hip flexors and glutes). Try to add two or three longer stretch routines a week to your workout schedule. Do some yoga to help you with your flexibility."

[8] X Trustworthy Source Johns Hopkins Medicine Official resource database of the world-leading Johns Hopkins Hospital Go to source Set an end date and work backward. Even with an 800m run, pick a date that you want to accomplish this run with your best time ever. Do one or two quality and intense workouts a week. These include running hills or tempo runs. Pick rest days where you can do some other sort of moderate exercise like yoga to stay limber. Ensure that you get enough sleep before the race."

      "title": "Understand the mechanics of your run.",
      "content": "Understand the mechanics of your run. The 800m run is a middle-distance race. These rely on the runner being able to maintain a fast pace throughout the race and then being able to sprint in the last stretch. Working out is going to require you to hone in on the following three abilities: Develop middle-distance running mechanics. This is also known as speed-stamina. You're going to need to establish a fast pace for the beginning of the race while maintaining control of your body. The goal is to be able to maintain a comfortable, but fast pace throughout the run, keeping in mind that you will exert a lot of energy in a full sprint at the end of the race. Learn to run in runner traffic. People who run an 800m race will have to deal with runner traffic on the inside of the track. Train yourself to minimize being caught in the pack by running in groups to learn how to be conscious of your running form without clipping the person in front of you. Run anaerobically. The last half (350-400 meters) of the race, your body will often feel fatigue from your almost sprint-like speed. Build this ability by sprinting 400m at a faster than normal pace; then walking for 2 minutes before repeating. This interval training will improve your anaerobic fitness."

Use the 400m to develop speed in sprinting. Use the 1600m to develop a high-speed endurance pace. Refer to your training schedule. Remember to take rest days to stretch and continue eating a healthy diet to fuel for your next run. Also go on runs that will train your body in different ways, like hill running to improve leg muscles and cardiovascular strengthening."

[10] X Research source While you typically want to be somewhat active on rest days, you also need to allow your body to truly rest. This means that you get enough sleep and keep a consistent sleep schedule. Don’t run on an injury. If you experience an injury, stop training, and see a doctor so you don’t injure yourself further."

You want to give your body the right nutrition to energize, but you don’t want to overdo it by eating too much. Before running, eat a snack instead of a whole meal as that means fewer calories your body has to try and process during your race.

      "title": "Run your 800m.",
      "content": "Run your 800m. A basic rule in middle distance races (800 and 1600 meters) is that a runner must maintain a fast pace and maintain enough energy to have two bursts of acceleration. Start of the race off right. Run fast at a speed that you can maintain well. Consistency is key here. Be smart in the middle of the race. Be conscious of the other runners and your changes in pace. You will need the energy to sprint at the beginning and end of the race. Use the first acceleration to merge into the inner lanes and get as close to the front of the pack as you can. Be conscious of when you are over exerting yourself so that you have enough energy for the second acceleration at the end of the race. You want to maintain a consistent pace until it’s time to accelerate; don’t let other runners affect your pace. In the last 200m or 300m, begin to sprint at full pace. This is where the anaerobic training comes in. Push your body, using your last acceleration to pass the pack leaders and win the race."

Stretch again for 5-10 minutes to ensure that your muscles don’t tighten up too much from working so hard."
