The earliest kittens should be separated from their mother is 8 weeks – and \"no sooner,\" according to Reimers. [1] X Expert Source Rita Reimers Cat Behaviorist Expert Interview. 22 Jun 2021. Many experts also recommend leaving kittens with their littermates until 10-12 weeks so they can be properly socialized. Socialization is the process whereby kittens explore their surroundings and accept what they find as normal. They also learn important skills, like how to use the litter box. [2] X Research source You'll know a kitten is ready to re-home around 12 weeks when they're confident, playful, and enjoy independent activities like exploring the house or hunting toys. If they're rehomed too early (before 8 weeks), the kitten is more likely to be fearful and hide from their new owner."

Use this fact to ease the kitten's transition into their new home by having the new owner provide you with an old T-shirt that smells like them. Put the t-shirt in the kitten's bed or favorite space to help them get used to their scent. This way, when the kitten moves to their new home, they'll already be familiar with one of the scents and immediately feel more comfortable."

If you're adopting a kitten before then, though, you'll need to accelerate the weaning process. Separate the kitten from their mother for short periods starting at 4 weeks. Put the kitten in another room, keep them in there for a few minutes, then slowly work up to a few hours. [5] X Research source Place a litter box, food, and water bowl in the room with the kitten. At 4 weeks, it's normal for the mother cat to start leaving her kitten alone for longer and longer periods of time. Weaning also helps kittens avoid bad habits like \"wool sucking,\" where cat’s chew and suck on things like fabric.

It should be quiet and out of the way. The space should have a bed, water, kitten food, a litter box, scratching post, and safe toys. Whether you use a cardboard box or a bed purchased from a pet store, consider lining it with an old sweatshirt so your kitten can grow accustomed to your scent. Seay recommends giving your kitten plenty of high, vertical spaces to perch on, such as cat trees, as well as hiding places on the ground. Boxes are great (and cheap) options! But avoid giving her human furniture such as couches and beds to hide on, if possible. These are areas \"where if there was an emergency, [you] wouldn't be able to easily get them out,\" says Seay.
