      "title": "Look for evidence of chafing around your baby's pelvic area.",
      "content": "Look for evidence of chafing around your baby's pelvic area. Chafing (contact dermatitis) is the most common cause of diaper rash. If you see small bumps and redness pop up in high-friction areas like the crease between your baby's leg and groin or where the diaper crosses your baby's butt cheeks. [1] X Research source Diaper rash can also occur where the diaper runs across your baby's lower abdomen."

      "content": "Check for signs of a yeast infection in the creases of your baby’s lower body. If you notice a bright red rash spreading from the creases between your baby's abdomen and thighs, it may be a yeast infection caused by candida. It can also occur near your baby’s butt crack and butt folds (where their legs meet their bum). The rash may look bright red with small acne-like dots or bumps around the edges. [2] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source It'll likely be tender so your baby may express signs of discomfort as well."

      "title": "Identify any painful red bumps or crusty boils as impetigo.",
      "content": "Identify any painful red bumps or crusty boils as impetigo. Impetigo is a bacterial infection that occurs as a secondary reaction to irritation. You may notice yellowish scabs, sores, pimples, or draining pus in the affected area. This can occur on your baby’s bottom as well as on their hands, feet, nose, and mouth. [3] X Trustworthy Source Seattle Children's Hospital Health information provided by Seattle Children's hospital. Go to source Impetigo is much rarer than other types of diaper rash."

      "title": "Inspect your baby’s chin and armpits for signs of intertrigo rashes.",
      "content": "Inspect your baby’s chin and armpits for signs of intertrigo rashes. Intertrigo rashes can occur not just on your baby’s butt-crack but in places where your baby’s skin is exposed to heat or moisture like under the chin or in your baby’s armpits. Your baby may also express some signs of discomfort like fussiness or crying when they move their legs or arms. [4] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source You’ll need to be extra careful cleaning your baby’s bottom if they have intertrigo rashes in their butt crack since they can be quite painful."

      "content": "Note any greasy or scaly rashes on your baby’s head, nose, or neck. If you notice a rash that looks greasy or has yellowish scales on your baby’s body (anywhere from their butt to their head), it could be a seborrheic rash. This is a bacterial infection that’s also referred to as cradle cap, seborrhea, seborrheic eczema, and seborrheic psoriasis. [5] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source You’ll treat seborrheic rashes in roughly the same way, just note that they could be signs of eczema and psoriasis and may require a doctor’s care to clear up."

      "title": "Pay attention to signs and symptoms of an allergic reaction.",
      "content": "Pay attention to signs and symptoms of an allergic reaction. If your baby's rash is caused by an allergy to some chemical or material (like laundry detergent or fabric) the rash may look splotchy with raised areas of red or white skin. The rash may show up as soon as clothing comes in contact with your baby’s skin or within a week of contact. [6] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source It’s extremely rare for contact allergies to cause a severe reaction, but if you notice your baby has trouble breathing or shows any signs of swelling, call for emergency medical care right away."

      "content": "Notice any scaly patches or other signs of eczema on your baby’s entire body. If your baby's bum (or other parts of their body) is extra dry and has scaly or flaky red patches, it may be eczema. If this is the case, focus on using topical creams to clear it up. [7] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Petroleum-based or zinc-oxide creams are clinically proven to treat eczema. Eczema can appear anywhere on the body, especially the cheeks and joint areas. If you have eczema your baby is much more likely to have it as well."

      "content": "Apply a petroleum-based cream to any kind of diaper rash to protect the skin. Apply a quarter-sized amount of diaper rash cream to the rash after your baby’s bottom is clean and dry. Rub it on gently to avoid creating any friction. The petroleum jelly found in most diaper rash creams will create a barrier of moisture that will protect your baby’s bum from friction and allow it to heal faster. [8] X Research source A&D is a brand name petroleum-based cream. You also use regular petroleum jelly. Some petroleum-based creams contain lanolin, which can be very effective at treating diaper rash. However, if you or your baby have a known allergy to wool or lanolin, check to make sure the cream doesn’t contain lanolin before you use it."

      "title": "Try a non-allergenic diaper rash cream containing zinc-oxide for bacterial diaper rash.",
      "content": "Try a non-allergenic diaper rash cream containing zinc-oxide for bacterial diaper rash. Apply a liberal amount of zinc-oxide-based diaper rash cream to your baby’s bottom after each diaper change. Make sure their skin is fully dry. The compound repels water from the surface of your baby's skin, creating a barrier that prevents bacteria from penetrating the skin and allows the skin to heal faster. [9] X Trustworthy Source Johns Hopkins Medicine Official resource database of the world-leading Johns Hopkins Hospital Go to source Most diaper rash creams advertised as \"hypoallergenic\" or \"all-natural\" rely on zinc oxide as the main active ingredient. When in doubt, check the ingredients list on the package. Desitin or Balmex are brand names of diaper rash cream that contain zinc oxide."

      "title": "Apply some breast milk to all non-fungal types of diaper rash.",
      "content": "Apply some breast milk to all non-fungal types of diaper rash. Whether the rash is caused by chafing, bacteria, or an allergic reaction, breastmilk’s antimicrobial properties can help heal your baby's sensitive skin. Express a little milk onto the rash and let it dry after changing your baby's diaper. [10] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Do not use breastmilk if your baby's diaper rash is caused by yeast (candida) because sugars in breastmilk can feed the yeast and make it worse. Intertrigo can be caused by bacteria or fungus, so it’s best to skip breastmilk if you suspect it’s intertrigo."

      "title": "Use coconut or olive oil to soothe and heal all kinds of diaper rash.",
      "content": "Use coconut or olive oil to soothe and heal all kinds of diaper rash. Both coconut and olive oil can form a barrier around your baby's sensitive skin, allowing it to heal faster. It’s a good remedy for any type of diaper rash but is especially helpful if you suspect your baby's rash is caused by chafing because of the oil’s moisture-restoring properties. [11] X Research source The only drawback to using natural oils is that it can cause the lining of the diaper to not absorb moisture as well. To mitigate this, use a liner or disposable diaper after applying olive or coconut oil."

      "content": "Change your baby's diapers as soon as they're soiled. Exposure to urine and poop can cause diaper rashes due to acidity or due to the moist environment inside the diaper. Check your baby's diaper every 30 minutes or if your baby gives you any clues that they've gone (farting, fussiness). [14] X Research source You should change your baby's diaper at least once every 2 to 3 hours. Always use a fresh diaper so you don’t spread any germs or bacteria."

      "title": "Keep the diapers as loose as possible.",
      "content": "Keep the diapers as loose as possible. Tight diapers decrease the amount of airflow to your baby's bum, creating an environment that's too moist (which leads to diaper rash). Make sure it's tight enough to prevent leaks but not so tight that it's constricting. [18] X Research source Too-tight diapers can also cause chaffing, so it's important to get a loose, comfortable fit."
