      "title": "Utilise your rod cells.",
      "content": "Utilise your rod cells. Your rod cells take about 30 to 45 minutes to adapt to a change of light around you. Rod cells can only see black and white and have poor resolution but are very sensitive in night vision circumstances. Photopigments are chemicals contained in both rod and cone cells that are light-sensitive and convert what you see into a language that your brain can understand. Rhodopsin is a photopigment found in rod cells that is critical to night vision. Your ability to adapt to darkness depends on some things that may be out of your control, such as your age, previous eye injury or damage, and any existing eye conditions. In order to see in the darkness, you need to understand what it takes to improve your utilisation of the rod cells and manipulate your eyes to more quickly adapt to a sudden change in light. If you are trying to look at a dim light, don't look directly at it. By doing this, you are utilising your rod cells instead of your cone cells which would happen if you look directly at the dim light. This trick is often used by astronomers."

      "title": "Wear red-tinted glasses or goggles.",
      "content": "Wear red-tinted glasses or goggles. Rod cells don't pick up the color red, so 20–30 minutes of wearing red tinted glasses before you go into a dark area can help you to detect motion around you more quickly. By blocking everything in the visible spectrum except red, the glasses will allow your rods to adjust to “darkness” of a sort before you head out. This is a common trick that aviators use when they don't have time to sit in perfect darkness and adjust before night-flying."

      "title": "Avoid looking directly at any light sources.",
      "content": "Avoid looking directly at any light sources. Light sources will force your pupils to contract and diminish your night vision. [1] X Trustworthy Source American Optometric Association Professional medical organization dedicated to supporting optometrists and improving public eye and vision health Go to source The pupil works like the aperture part of a camera, getting smaller or larger depending on the amount of light that is entering the eye. The more light, the smaller the pupil gets. In lower light situations, your pupil opens wide to let in as much light as possible. By looking directly into a light source, you are extending the amount of time it will take for your vision to adjust, or readjust, to the low light. If you can't avoid looking at a light source, cover or close one eye, or safely divert your gaze, until it passes."

      "title": "Improve your night vision while driving.",
      "content": "Improve your night vision while driving. Take steps before you get in the car to help enhance your vision as you drive at night. As just mentioned, try to avoid looking directly at an oncoming light source. If someone comes around the bend with their high-beams on, protecting one eye will prevent you from getting “flash blindness” in both eyes, allowing you to more easily adjust back to the darkness. Look at the white line off to the right but still on your side of the road. This allows you to maintain a safe course, see movement around you with your peripheral vision and still avoid looking directly into someone's high beams. Dim your dash lights to a low but safe level to help your vision while driving at night. Also, use your mirror's “night” setting. This helps to reduce glare from vehicles that are behind you. Clean your headlights, wipers, and windshield regularly. Spots on the windshield become sources of glare when you are driving at night. Have regular maintenance on your car that includes headlight and fog light adjustments. Even a degree or two of difference can prevent your lights from causing vision problems for other drivers."

      "content": "Let your eyes adjust to the darkness naturally. The best way to see in the dark is to let yourself slowly acclimate by relaxing in perfect darkness for 20 to 30 minutes. To adjust to the darkness more quickly, wear an eye mask, or close and cover your eyes, to give your eyes a chance to adjust before entering a darkened area. Try an eyepatch. By protecting one eye from light for 20 to 30 minutes, you will be able to enter a darkened area with that eye already accustomed to the darkness. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Use your peripheral vision.",
      "content": "Use your peripheral vision. Your eyes have natural blind spots and navigating your way through an area in darkness can cause problems if you try to center your gaze. [3] X Research source Try to focus your gaze on the side of any object you think is there, or just off-center of the direction you are going as you move forward through a dark area. This allows your peripheral vision to help detect movement and object shape much better than trying to look at something directly. Using your peripheral vision engages more rod cells, which are key in navigating your way through a dark area, identifying shapes, and detecting movement."

[4] X Trustworthy Source American Optometric Association Professional medical organization dedicated to supporting optometrists and improving public eye and vision health Go to source The night sky provides a source of light. By positioning yourself as low as possible, the light from the night sky or a window provides enough contrast to help the rod cells in your eyes do their job more easily. In some forms of martial arts training, students are often instructed to stay as low as possible, using the sky to illuminate objects and opponents by creating a silhouette. While the rods in your eyes are far more light-sensitive than the cones, they can only discriminate between black and white and provide low-quality images by contrasting the available light source behind objects."

After about 5 or 10 seconds into the massage, the normal blackness turns to white for a few seconds. When the white fades and the blackness returns, open your eyes and your vision will be better in the darkness. Special Forces have reportedly used a similar method of squeezing their eyes shut tightly for five to 10 seconds once they were in a dark area. Science has not proven the efficacy of this technique, but it may be helpful for some people."

      "content": "Consider learning to see with sound. Research is ongoing, but promising, in working with people that are blind. They are developing the ability to perform clicking sounds with their tongue, termed “flash sonar”, which is similar to the sonar used by bats. By using flash sonar , people can locate objects in front and around them in a remarkable way. For example, one person demonstrated this method by using clicking sounds made with her tongue to “scan” the space in front of her until she could locate a pot held by another person. With a few more clicks, she could identify the type and contour of the lid on the pot. Another person that is considered a flash sonar expert can ride a mountain bike through difficult terrain and navigate an obstacle course without incident by using this technique. The experts of flash sonar claim that it is a skill that anyone can develop."

      "content": "Wear sunglasses during the daytime. A few hours of exposure to bright sunlight light and ultraviolet radiation from the sun can reduce your ability to adjust to darkness. [7] X Trustworthy Source American Optometric Association Professional medical organization dedicated to supporting optometrists and improving public eye and vision health Go to source Daytime exposure to the bright sunlight without wearing sunglasses can cause your adjustment to the darkness to be delayed by about 10 minutes for every 2 to 3 hours of bright sunlight exposure. Plus, in addition to the time delay in adapting to the dark, the degree of night vision is also reduced. For example, ten consecutive days of exposure to bright sunlight without protective eyewear can reduce your night vision by as much as 50%. With time, your rods, cones, and photopigments return to baseline. Every person is different in the length of time they may be impacted. Sunglasses with neutral gray lenses that transmit 15% of visible light are recommended."

For every 20 minutes of intense work, especially looking at a computer screen, take a break and look off into the distance for 20 seconds. This gives your eyes a chance to refocus. For every two hours of constant focus on a computer screen or something else that requires intent viewing, rest your eyes for 15 minutes.

With the help of a partner, stand one to two feet (0.3 to 0.6 meters) away from the straw armed with a toothpick in each hand. Your partner is to hold the straw horizontally. While you are looking at the black line, notice the ends of the straw using your peripheral vision. Focus only on the black line. Attempt to place the toothpicks in the ends of the straw on either side without diverting your gaze away from the black line.

      "title": "Consume more vitamin A.",
      "content": "Consume more vitamin A. One of the first signs of vitamin A deficiency is night blindness. [14] X Research source In Ancient Egypt, it was discovered that night blindness could be cured by eating liver, which was later found to be a rich source of vitamin A. Low vitamin A levels can also cause the cornea to become very dry, leading to the clouding of the front of the eye, corneal ulcers and vision loss, as well as retina damage and problems with the conjunctiva. Carrots, broccoli, squash, cantaloupe, fish, liver, fortified cereals, dairy products, kale, blueberries, and apricots are all excellent sources of vitamin A. While increasing your consumption of foods that are rich in vitamin A may be helpful, research done in this area has revealed that, in the case of vitamin A, taking supplements provided higher levels than increasing the dietary sources. Plus, excessive consumption doesn't strengthen your eyes. Vitamin A supplements are available in oral doses, like tablets or capsules, and are marketed in either mcg strengths or units. The average recommended adult dose of vitamin A in mcgs is between 800 to 1000 mcg each day. In units, the dose range is between 2600 and 3300 units consumed daily. The protein rhodopsin found in the eye breaks down into retinal and opsin when exposed to light and reforms when back in the dark. A severe lack of vitamin A in the diet may result in night blindness, but extra vitamin A will not help one see better than normal."

Omega-3 fatty acids fight macular degeneration and promote overall eye health and good vision, as well as fighting dry eye. In one study, patients who ate oily fish once per week had half the risk of developing neovascular macular degeneration, compared with patients who didn't. Long term, over a period of 12 years or so, the risk remains much lower with a higher level of omega-3s."
