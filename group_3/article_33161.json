The universe of Genshin Impact has you traveling all over the world of Teyvat—a fantastical continent with over 7 distinct regions (that are being released gradually by the game developers). Since this is a game with high-quality graphics and tons of content, you’ll need to have a big chunk of storage space set aside on the device you plan to play on. [1] X Research source As of June 2023, the PC download is nearly 73 GB, while the PlayStation download (for PS4 or PS5) is almost 71 GB. On phones and tablets, nearly 21 GB of storage space is needed for Genshin Impact . Genshin Impact is still a developing game with plenty of new features and locations in the works. As the game progresses, expect to set aside more and more storage space on your device to accommodate new updates. Did You Know? Genshin Impact offers both cross-platform and cross-save features. Cross-platform means that you can play the game with people on other devices (like a phone or console), while cross-save means that you can save your game progress over multiple devices (as long as you’re logged into the same Hoyoverse account on all your devices).

Story Quests: Story Quests are character-based side quests that allow you to learn more about a specific character. Daily Commissions: Daily Commissions are 4 randomized, small-scale quests that you get each day when you log into the game. Completing these commissions is a valuable way to gain XP and in-game currency. World Quests: World Quests are interesting side quests that give you an opportunity to explore each region a little more (while getting to know some NPCs). Hangout Events: Hangout events give you 1-on-1 time with a specific character, similar to a dating simulator game. In these events, you essentially have virtual conversations/interactions with a specific character. [5] X Research source"

As you search for your sibling, you’ll journey across many regions and meet with the Archon (god) of each corresponding area. The regions you’ll eventually visit are: Mondstadt (ruled by the archon Barbatos) Liyue (ruled by Rex Lapis) Inazuma (ruled by the Raiden Shogun) Sumeru (ruled by the Lesser Lord Kusanali) Fontaine (ruled by Focalors and Neuvillette) Natlan (ruled by the God of War) Snezhnaya (ruled by the Tsaritsa) [7] X Research source"

From there, hit the “Wish x1” or “Wish x10” button on your desired banner to receive a random character or weapon, or a random set of 10 characters and/or weapons. More common characters are ranked as “4-star,” and the rarest characters are ranked as “5-star.” [9] X Research source Genshin Impact uses a “gacha” (lottery-based) system to unlock new characters or weapons. A single Wish (also known as a “pull”) costs 1 Acquaint Fate or Intertwined Fate, while 10 Wishes cost 10 Aquaint Fates or Intertwined Fates. Each Fate (both Acquaint or Intertwined) costs 160 primogems, with a 10-Fate pull costing 1600 primogems. Primogems can be earned for free throughout the game via different achievements and quests. They can also be bought with Genesis Crystals, a type of currency that you buy with real money. It costs around $3 to get a single wish, or $30 to buy a 10-Wish pull (though the game awards bonus crystals to players purchasing certain bundles for the first time). [10] X Research source There are 3 different banners you can typically pull from: the Character Event Wish banner, which features a limited-edition 5-star character and 3 promoted 4-star characters; the Weapon Event Wish banner, which features weapons specifically; and the Wanderlust Invocation, a permanent banner that features the same pool of 4-star and 5-star weapons and characters. Intertwined Fates (the pink-colored Fates) can be used for the Character and Weapon Event Wish banners, while Acquaint Fates (the blue-colored Fates) can be used for the Wanderlust Invocation.

Genshin Impact operates on a “Pity” system—the more unsuccessful (5-star-less) pulls you have, the greater chance the game will give you a 5-star character or weapon. You’re guaranteed to get a 5-star by your 90th pull, though there’s a smaller chance to successfully pull a 5-star before that point. [12] X Research source The Event banners (for both Characters and Weapons) operate on a 50/50 rule—in other words, there’s a 50/50 chance that your guaranteed 5-star will be either the Event 5-star or one of the game’s default 5-stars. However, if you fail your first 50/50, you’re guaranteed to get the special Event 5-star on your second go-around (though this can, admittedly, take up to 180 total pulls)."

Collei is also unlocked automatically as you journey through Sumeru, the fourth main region discovered in the game.

No single weapon is “better” than the other types, but certain quests and challenges within the game are best suited for ranged weapons (like bows and catalysts), while others are better suited for melee weapons (like swords, claymores, and polearms). [16] X Research source Claymores are essentially thicker swords, polearms are like spears, and catalysts are floating objects that let the caster attack directly with their magic. Characters can only play with one style of weapon—for instance, Cyno (a polearm user) can’t be equipped with a sword, claymore, catalyst, or bow. As you pull weapons for banners, they collect in your inventory, which can be accessed via the backpack icon in the top right corner of your screen. Each character can only be equipped with one weapon at a time; if you want to switch their weapon out, go to the “Weapons” section of the inventory to make the change. [17] X Research source"

If you’re low on health during a battle, eating food can help heal (or even revive) members of your party.
