These include alternating between five \"back blows\" and five \"abdominal thrusts\" (also known as the Heimlich maneuver), repeating the cycle until the object is dislodged, emergency personnel arrive, or the victim becomes unconscious due to lack of oxygen. [3] X Research source Back blows are a forceful motion with the heel of your hand between the person's shoulder blades, when he is bending over so that his trunk is at least parallel to the ground (this way, if you successfully dislodge the obstructing object it will fall with gravity out of the victim's airway). The back blows are optional, depending on whether you have been trained how to effectively do these (if not, skip them and do only \"abdominal thrusts,\" which are described in the next section)."

If there is no pulse, proceed straight to CPR (cardiopulmonary resuscitation) at a rate of 100 chest compressions per minute. Do not attempt abdominal thrusts at this time (and do not do rescue breaths in this situation as the airway is obstructed)."

Both men and women have an Adam's apple, but they are more pronounced on adult men. You may have to feel the victim's neck to find the Adam's apple on a woman or a child. Slide your finger down from the Adam's Apple until you feel another bulge; this is the cricoid cartilage. There is a slight indentation in between the Adam's Apple and the cricoid cartilage; this is where the incision will be made."

[9] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Given the emergency nature of this procedure, it is okay to proceed without formal sterilization. Time is of the essence, and the concern of potential infection can be dealt with when emergency medical personnel arrive. However, if gloves are available — even if they are not sterile — use them to protect yourself from bloodborne diseases like HIV and hepatitis."

[11] X Trustworthy Source Johns Hopkins Medicine Official resource database of the world-leading Johns Hopkins Hospital Go to source If the victim is breathing on her own, continue to supervise her and wait for emergency medical personnel to arrive to deal with the situation more definitively. If the victim is not breathing on her own, continue giving breaths and check for a pulse. In the absence of a pulse, proceed to CPR. The cycle for CPR is 30 chest compressions (at a rate of approximately 100 chest compressions per minute) followed by two rescue breaths through the breathing tube. Repeat this cycle approximately five times. If the victim is unresponsive after five cycles, use an AED (automated external defibrillator) if you have been trained how to do so. If not, follow instructions from emergency medical personnel who can give directions over the phone while you await their arrival. Note that if you are untrained in CPR, the chest compressions are more important than the rescue breaths, so it is okay to do chest compressions only (at a rate of 100/minute) and to omit the breaths until emergency medical personnel arrive. Remember that doing something is better than nothing, as someone's life is on the line here!"
