      "title": "Remove the giblets from the turkey.",
      "content": "Remove the giblets from the turkey. Take the turkey out of its packaging and check the body and neck cavities for any organs, or giblets. The giblets are typically in a small paper bag. You might also find a neck inside the turkey. You can discard the giblets or save them to make into a stock or incorporate into stuffing. If the turkey is frozen, you’ll need to thaw it first. If you thaw the turkey in the fridge, this could take up to 5 or 6 days for a larger bird. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Season the turkey to taste.",
      "content": "Season the turkey to taste. If the turkey is moist, gently pat it dry with a paper towel. Set the turkey in a baking dish and rub the skin with softened butter or olive oil. Season the skin with salt and pepper, or add other seasonings, such as garlic powder, paprika, or thyme. [4] X Research source If you like, you can add butter and seasoning under the skin or inside the body cavity."

      "title": "Cover the bottom of the crock pot with water.",
      "content": "Cover the bottom of the crock pot with water. Put a little water or broth in the bottom of the crock pot. This will help keep the turkey from sticking to the crock pot or burning. If you like, you can also put some vegetables in the bottom of the pot, such as onions, carrots, or potatoes. There’s no need to add a lot of water or broth. The turkey will make its own juices as it cooks. Alternatively, you can use a slow-cooker liner to help keep the turkey juicy and prevent sticking. The liner also makes it easier to clean out the slow-cooker when you’re done. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Cook the turkey on high for 1 hour.",
      "content": "Cook the turkey on high for 1 hour. Cooking the turkey on high for an hour will help speed up the process a little. It will also help quickly cook out any bacteria that might be in the turkey and make it safer to eat. [6] X Research source Alternatively, put hot water or broth in the slow cooker and pre-heat it to the highest temperature setting before putting in the turkey and reducing it to low."

    {
      "title": "Reduce the heat to low and cook for another 8 hours.",
      "content": "Reduce the heat to low and cook for another 8 hours. After the first hour, turn the crock pot down to low. Let the turkey cook for 8 more hours or until it’s done. You can tell the turkey is done when a meat thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh reads 165 °F (74 °C). [7] X Research source Avoid opening the slow cooker frequently, since this will let out heat and slow down the cooking time. Take care not to overcook the turkey, since the white meat will become dry if it cooks too long."

      "title": "Remove the giblets from the turkey.",
      "content": "Remove the giblets from the turkey. Take your fresh or thawed turkey out of its packaging and check inside the neck and body cavities for a giblet bag. You can keep the giblets to use in stock or stuffing, or throw them away with the packaging. Some turkeys may contain a neck as well as giblets."

      "title": "Rub the turkey with butter and add seasonings.",
      "content": "Rub the turkey with butter and add seasonings. If the turkey is damp, pat it dry with a paper towel, then set it in a roasting pan. The dryer the skin is, the more crispy it will be. Take some softened butter or olive oil and rub the entire surface of the turkey with it. Season the outside of the turkey with salt, pepper, or any other seasonings of your choice, such as garlic, thyme, or paprika. [8] X Research source You can also put seasonings under the skin or in the inner cavity of the turkey. For example, you can use orange, lemon, clove, onion, and rosemary to stuff the cavity and infuse the turkey with flavor. Mix 1 cup of butter with chopped rosemary and thyme (1 tablespoon of each), 5 minced cloves of garlic, zest of 1 orange and 1 lemon, a pinch of salt and a dash of honey. Place it in the refrigerator until the butter is firm, then place slices of the compound butter between the meat and the skin of the turkey."

      "content": "Place the uncovered turkey in your refrigerator for 12-24 hours. Put the turkey on a rack inside a roasting pan. Place the turkey uncovered in its roasting pan in your refrigerator. Leave the turkey uncovered so that the skin can dry out, which will help it get crispy in the oven. [9] X Research source Don’t let other items in the fridge touch the raw turkey."

      "content": "Cook the turkey at 450 °F (232 °C) for 45 minutes. Preheat the oven to 450 °F (232 °C) and put the turkey in the oven in its roasting pan. Cooking the turkey on high heat for 45 minutes, or up to an hour, will help kill any bacteria and make the slow roasting process safer. [10] X Research source It will also help make the turkey skin crispy and golden brown before you switch to low heat. [11] X Research source You may need to remove 1 or more racks from your oven to make the turkey fit."

This will mingle with your turkey’s natural juices to produce a flavorful jus gravy. [12] X Research source If you like, you can sprinkle a few pinches of poultry seasoning in the liquid to add a hint of savory spice."

[13] X Research source To test for doneness, put a meat thermometer in the thickest part of the thigh. When it reads 165 °F (74 °C), the turkey is done. Make sure your oven is correctly calibrated so the temperature doesn’t drop into the “danger zone” in which dangerous bacteria can grow, between 40 and 140 °F (4 and 60 °C).
