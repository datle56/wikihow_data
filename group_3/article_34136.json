      "title": "Use furniture coasters.",
      "content": "Use furniture coasters. These are flat disks that go under furniture legs and distribute the weight of the furniture over a wider area, which keeps the carpet from denting. Lift up each of the legs of your furniture and place a coaster underneath them. Furniture coasters range in quality from simple rubber products to decorative glass. As always, be careful when moving or lifting your furniture, especially if it’s heavy. Get help from friends with this process or hire professional movers. There are also furniture coasters that are called “caster cups.” These coasters have spikes that sink into the carpet to prevent dents. The spikes help to keep the coasters in place, too."

      "title": "Move your furniture every month.",
      "content": "Move your furniture every month. Adjusting the position of your furniture, especially the heavy pieces, each month will help to prevent the deepest dents. The furniture will need to be moved out of the current dent and at least 1 inch (2.5 cm) away. Be careful that your furniture doesn’t tear into the carpet when you move it. It might help to use furniture slides to move your heaviest pieces. These are thin plastic pieces that slide under the legs and help you to move heavy furniture around."

      "title": "Vacuum your carpet at least once a week.",
      "content": "Vacuum your carpet at least once a week. Even if your carpet doesn’t appear dirty on the surface, it probably has tiny dust and debris weighing down the fibers. Running your vacuum over your carpet helps to lift up the fibers, making them appear less crushed or dented.If you see a deep dent, apply the vacuum suction attachment to the area. Experiment with your vacuum’s suctions settings to see which one gets the best results for your carpet type. Most vacuums have adjustments for low, medium, and high pile carpets."

      "title": "Place rugs in high-traffic areas and under furniture.",
      "content": "Place rugs in high-traffic areas and under furniture. After you’ve created the furniture layout of each room, decide if a rug would work under any large, heavy pieces of furniture. This will remove some of the weight burden from the carpet. Repeated foot traffic can also cause low-grade dents, so try to lay rugs in areas where people will be walking back and forth repeatedly. For example, if you have a carpeted hallway, a rug can minimize the wear to the center part of the carpet. If you place rugs under furniture, they may become dented over time. It can help to move them a bit every few months."

      "title": "Apply ice cubes to the dented areas.",
      "content": "Apply ice cubes to the dented areas. The cubes should fully cover the dents, so you’ll need more if there’s a lot of damage. Then, let the ice melt into the carpet for at least 3 hours. Dab the carpet with a cloth or sponge to remove any excess moisture and revive the texture. [1] X Research source When the carpet is damp, use a spoon to gently lift up any fallen fibers. You’ll want to get down near to the carpet to see exactly which fibers need to be fixed. Depending on the size of the dents, you may need to repeat this process multiple times to see results. Wait until the carpet fully dries before trying again."
    },
    {
      "title": "Blow dry the carpet dents.",
      "content": "Blow dry the carpet dents. Start by spritzing the dented areas with water until they are saturated. Then, put your blow dryer on a low heat setting. Hold it 4 to 6 inches (10 to 15 cm) away from the carpet dent. Blow dry the dented area until it is fully dry. Repeat with other dents. [2] X Research source As you blow dry, run your fingers through the carpet to add texture."

    {
      "title": "Iron over the dents.",
      "content": "Iron over the dents. Moisten a dish cloth or towel until it is saturated. Then, place this towel flat on top of the dented area. Put your iron on a medium heat setting and allow it to warm up. Then, apply the iron to the towel for 30 seconds to 1 minute. Pull up the towel and fluff the fibers with your fingers. [3] X Research source Move the iron in small circular motions above the dent to even out the heat application. Don’t allow the iron to touch the carpet fibers or it will burn them. The iron should only have contact with the dampened towel or cloth."

    {
      "title": "Select high-density carpet.",
      "content": "Select high-density carpet. You can easily determine if a carpet is high density by folding over the sample. Then, look for the backing between the fibers. A high-density carpet will not show the backing. It will cost more, but will withstand the strain of heavy furniture better. It will also be more comfortable and last longer. [4] X Research source A long pile height doesn’t necessarily mean that a carpet is dense. If each fiber is very thin, then it will still dent easily."

    {
      "title": "Choose firm carpet padding.",
      "content": "Choose firm carpet padding. Look for a firm, thin pad. Press your fingers into the pad and look for one that provides the most resistance. A thick carpet pad may reduce noise and be more comfortable to walk on, but it allows carpet to flex too much and increases the chances that carpet will develop dents. A pad that isn't firm enough will be permanently crushed by heavy furniture. [5] X Research source Always install a fresh carpet pad with new carpet. If you create multiple layers of pads, then you’ll get a ripple effect on the carpet’s surface."

      "title": "Hire a professional for installation.",
      "content": "Hire a professional for installation. Installing carpet on your own without expert guidance can lead to a lumpy, easily dented floor. Most carpet and flooring stores can recommend contractors to you who have experience with installation. Check their references and reviews personally before moving forward. Most reputable contractors will also come out to your home and provide an estimate for your carpet installation project. If an installer doesn’t listen to your concerns about durability and denting, hire another person to do the job."
