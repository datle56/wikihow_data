      "title": "Understand the return policy.",
      "content": "Understand the return policy. According to Groupon's return policy, you can receive refunds under the following conditions depending on the item you're returning: Local Deals — These items can be returned for a refund within 3 days of purchasing them. Groupon Getaways — You can refund Groupon Getaways any time before the \"book-by\" date. Groupon Goods — These items can be returned within 30 days of the date of purchase. GrouponLive — You usually can't refund these vouchers past the day on which you purchased them. Groupon returns are notoriously convoluted due to a lack of a customer support line and frequent errors on behalf of the items' shipping details."

      "title": "Know how the cancellation policy differs.",
      "content": "Know how the cancellation policy differs. Unfortunately, Groupon's cancellation policy is far less lenient than the return policy, and cancelling your order is often the easiest (and least error-prone) way to refund your order: Local Deals — Groupon allows you to self-cancel within one day; after this point, you may not be able to self-cancel. Groupon Getaways — Groupon's cancellation policy for getaways varies depending on the fine print of the getaway. Groupon Goods — You can cancel within two hours of your purchase. Although you can return items after they've been shipped to you, you may not receive a full credit. GrouponLive — You can cancel until midnight on the day of your purchase."
