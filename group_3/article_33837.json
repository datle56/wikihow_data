      "content": "Understand Hindu polytheism. Hinduism is both polytheist and monotheist. That means Hindus believe in many gods, but that they are all parts of a single god. This means that Hinduism is both diverse, with an array of gods and rituals, but also united in the belief of a single god. [1] X Research source Hinduism has thousands of gods and many of these gods manifest themselves in different forms. Brahman is the leading god and represents both existence, and non-existence. The three most important manifestations of Brahman are Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiva. Roughly speaking, Brahma is the creator god. Vishnu is the responsible for preserving creation. Finally, Shiva is the god of destruction or nonexistence. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Perform a japa.",
      "content": "Perform a japa. Japa is a way to clear your mind by focusing on a holy passage or the name of a god. Instead of asking for something, you are devoting yourself to the truth of what you are saying to accept the wisdom and serenity of mind that comes with it. You should count the repetitions of the mantra with a mala, a string of beads similar to a rosary. [4] X Research source [5] X Research source A mala has 108 beads and you should try to do either one full rotation or ten. There is one particularly big bead, known as the head bead. Start at the bead directly after the head bead and roll it around with your thumb every time you repeat the mantra. When you reach the head bead, you have completed a full rotation. [6] X Research source One good pose for performing japa is Padmasana. This is a basic cross-legged position in which you keep your body posture upright and your feet on top of the thigh of your opposite leg. [7] X Research source Face north or east while performing the japa. Sit on a rug. Do not hurry through the chant. Perform the chant slowly, concentrating on it, timing it with the slow pace of your breathing. Avoid distractions. Focus intently on the meaning of the mantra. Your goal is to clear your mind."
