      "content": "Find a place to lie down or sit in a relaxed posture. It can be hard to get comfortable to sleep when you don't have a bed to lie down in (at the airport, for instance). Sometimes there is simply no feasible place to lie down, so you may have to opt for a chair or sitting against a wall. If possible recline at a 135-degree angle for the most comfort. Avoid sleeping sitting straight up or leaning forward because this may cause undue pressure on your back and neck and it may also contribute to pain in those areas. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Use a pillow. A pillow helps make any unusual sleeping situation better. A travel pillow is best if you have to sit up while sleeping, such as on an airplane. If you're in an airport without a pillow, it might be time to splurge on a pillow at one of the travel shops. [2] X Research source If you don't have a pillow, you can make one out of any clothing you have. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Cover up with a jacket as a blanket. Often, on short trips, or during unexpected waits (such as in an emergency room), you may not have thought to bring a blanket. If you have a jacket or coat, you can put it over you to provide extra heat. This will help you stay warm while trying to sleep. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Use a small piece of fabric or a hat to cover your eyes. Or better yet, use a sleep mask. However, if you are caught unexpectedly needing to sleep without a bed, the likelihood is that you won't have a sleep mask on you. Don't worry, any lightweight, opaque fabric big enough to cover the eyes can help. This method works best if you are lying down or reclining. However, if you must sit, you may need to find something to drape over your head and face, such as a towel, that won't slide down. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Secure your belongings if you are in a public place. If you really want to be able to sleep in a public place, you'll need to secure your belongings. Make sure small valuables are in pockets, or covered in your lap. For larger belongings, such as a duffle bag or suitcase, you may try keeping one foot down in the strap, or placing the luggage between your feet if it isn't too big. If you can plan ahead of time, you can put locks on the luggage. If you are lying down, you may want to use it as a pillow. Sometimes, airports have storage lockers you can use. If you are really worried about your belongings, consider this option when available. [6] X Research source Never sleep in an area where you do not feel safe, especially if you are alone."

If not, try layering blankets to make the floor as comfy as possible. If you know beforehand that you'll be sleeping on the floor, bring your sleeping bag. Also, if the couch isn't quite comfortable because of armrests, you can try taking the cushions off the couch to make a makeshift bed."

Just because you’re sleeping in a recliner or on the couch doesn’t mean you can’t have your favorite pillow or blanket to keep you comfortable. Depending on the recliner you may need additional cushion for neck and back support. If you plan to sleep in the recliner all night, having a blanket can make it feel more restful."

      "title": "Use a sleeping bag.",
      "content": "Use a sleeping bag. A sleeping bag is one of the best way to ensure you get the rest you need while camping. However there are some things to consider when choosing a sleeping bag, including the climate and forecast of the area where you're camping, whether you're hot- or cold-natured, and the amount of padding or waterproofing it provides. You don't want to be camping in a really cold or wet area without a sufficient sleeping bag. [9] X Research source If you're planning a winter camping trip in a cold climate, make sure your sleeping bag is rated for the degree range you're going to be facing (-40 degrees, for instance). Some sleeping bags are rated for a lower temp than they'll actually stand up to, so it's best to choose a sleeping bag with a rating of at least 10 degrees below what you'll be facing. If you're camping in a really wet or rainy place, you'll want to make sure your sleeping bag and tent are waterproof, not just water-resistant. Water-resistant materials only keep out the water to a certain point. Waterproof materials should keep you dry. A sleeping bag with hydrophobic down is the best at keeping you warm in wet conditions. The \"mummy-style\" sleeping bag, or a sleeping bag that tapers at the end, is the best choice for staying warm, as it isn't as spacious as a rectangular sleeping bag, and thus is easier to keep warm with body heat."

You'll want to go over the area carefully, and remove all debris. Even the tiniest twig or pebble can disturb some people's sleep. You may want to choose an area that is layered in pine needles for extra cushion."

Using a pillow will help to keep your upper body in alignment when you are sleeping, and it may also help to prevent pain in your neck and back from undue pressure. [11] X Research source A pillow will also help your sleeping bag feel closer to home and provide cushion and support for your neck and head while you sleep. With all the logistics that sometimes go into camping, it can be easy to forget your pillow, but if you want a good night's rest while camping, you'll have it on hand. [12] X Research source If you do forget your pillow, try rolling up some clothing or other soft materials to use as a pillow."

Although sleeping upright can be a rewarding experience for some, there are some risks involved, especially if you sleep for a long time with your legs bent. DVT is a serious and potentially life-threatening condition. It is the formation of a blood clot in one or more of the deep veins in your body, usually the legs. Sitting still for long periods of time is a risk factor for DVT. You can prevent a DVT by stretching legs and shifting positions every few hours.
