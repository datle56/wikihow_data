      "title": "Go with a wide belt for comfort and smoother lines.",
      "content": "Go with a wide belt for comfort and smoother lines. If you plan to wear your garter belt underneath your everyday clothing, choose a wide belt style. These create smoother lines around the waist and hips and are far less likely to show through your clothes. Wide garter belts are also more comfortable than narrow ones, making them the better choice for daily wear. Widths vary, but opt for a belt that is at least as wide as your palm. It should sit at the narrow part of your waist, not on your hips. Narrow belts tend to slip down the hips, forcing you to pull at them all day."

    {
      "title": "Select a narrow belt for the bedroom.",
      "content": "Select a narrow belt for the bedroom. Comfort matters a lot less when you’re behind closed doors, and besides – you won’t be wearing that garter belt for long! If you’re shopping for something cute and slinky to wear in the bedroom, go with a narrow belt that fits around your hips."
    },
    {
      "title": "Choose one with hook-eye closures in the back for adjustability.",
      "content": "Choose one with hook-eye closures in the back for adjustability. This is a good idea no matter where you plan to wear your belt. Look for one that has hook-eye closures in the back, just like those on the backs of bras. For the most custom fit, choose a belt that offers three (or more) rows of hook-eye closures so you can adjust as needed."
    },
    {
      "title": "Ensure a good fit by choosing adjustable straps made of elastic.",
      "content": "Ensure a good fit by choosing adjustable straps made of elastic. The straps, or garters, are the suspender-looking pieces of fabric that hang down from the belt and attach to your stockings. Whether you’re wearing your belt behind closed doors or under your regular clothing, go with elastic straps that you can adjust with the same slide mechanism you have on your bra straps. Just like bras, there’s no one-size-fits-all garter belt, and being able to adjust the straps is key to a good fit."
    },
    {
      "title": "Choose the four-strap style to wear in the bedroom.",
      "content": "Choose the four-strap style to wear in the bedroom. Four garters (two in front and two in back) are all you need if comfort and practicality aren’t your goals. These styles look great, but they won’t hold up your stockings for long, especially if you’re walking around. They are also easier to get off, which makes them a good choice for the bedroom."
    },
    {
      "title": "Opt for six to eight straps for security and comfort.",
      "content": "Opt for six to eight straps for security and comfort. For daily wear, you need six garters minimum to truly hold up your stockings and keep everything in place – two in front, two in back, and two along your thighs. Some people prefer the extra security of eight straps, but this is mostly a matter of personal preference. Try both styles on and see which feels better for you."

    {
      "title": "Wear 10 to 12 straps to create fetish looks.",
      "content": "Wear 10 to 12 straps to create fetish looks. Anything beyond eight straps is outside the realm of comfort and more about creating a particular sexy vibe. If you enjoy intricate details, lots of straps, corsets, and other fetish wear, try one of the styles with 10 or even 12 straps. Keep in mind that if you plan to take these off in the bedroom, you’ll have quite a lot of unclasping to do!"

      "title": "Choose non-stretch satin, powernet, or cotton for daily wear.",
      "content": "Choose non-stretch satin, powernet, or cotton for daily wear. If you plan on wearing your garter belt under your daily clothes for any length of time, go with a breathable and comfortable fabric like satin, powernet (sometimes called powermesh) or just plain cotton. Everybody sweats, and it’s important for this area of the body to breathe – for both your comfort and your health."

      "content": "Select lux fabrics like leather, satin, and faux fur for the bedroom. Garter belts for the bedroom can be made of pretty much whatever you want! Lace, vinyl, silk, leather, faux fur, and nylon are just a few options. Get whatever looks and feels good for you. If you want that 12 strap leather garter belt trimmed with faux fur, go for it."

      "title": "Avoid embellishments like lace, ruffles, and bows for daily wear.",
      "content": "Avoid embellishments like lace, ruffles, and bows for daily wear. These embellishments look great but work best for the bedroom only. Unfortunately, little details like ruffles and bows will show right through your clothes. They can also snag on the inside seams of your clothes, forcing you to tug and adjust all day long.

      "title": "Choose a belt made of light-colored fabric for daily wear.",
      "content": "Choose a belt made of light-colored fabric for daily wear. If you’re wearing tight or light-colored clothing, dark fabrics may show right through, just like dark panties would – except so much more visibly! Always take your outfit into account before getting all strapped into your garter belt. It doesn’t hurt to double-check in the mirror before leaving your house, just in case. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Go with metal clips over plastic ones.",
      "content": "Go with metal clips over plastic ones. Plastic clips don’t grasp the stockings well and tend to slide right off. Whether you’re wearing the garter belt in or outside the bedroom, you want the clips to hold firmly onto your stockings. Metal is the best choice. Avoid the clips with metal teeth, though – those can snag and tear your stockings and clothing."

      "content": "Get measured and fitted at an independent lingerie boutique. If you've never bought a garter belt before, you may find it helpful to go down to your nearest lingerie boutique for a professional fitting. While the staff person is taking your measurements, give them an idea about what you're looking for and ask to see what they have in stock. [3] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Measure your waist and hips.",
      "content": "Measure your waist and hips. If you don't want to get a professional fitting or if you plan to buy online, having accurate measurements is key. Use a fabric measuring tape, if possible. Measure around your natural waist, which is the narrowest part of your torso. Then measure around the widest part of your hips. For most garter belts, all you really need is the waist measurement. However, if you plan to wear the belt at hip-level, you'll need the hip measurement. Either way, it's not a bad idea to have both. Write down the measurements in inches and centimeters (this will save you from having to convert later, since brands may use one or the other)."

    {
      "title": "Check the brand's sizing chart before making your purchase.",
      "content": "Check the brand's sizing chart before making your purchase. Measurements and sizes for garter belts will vary from brand to brand, so always check the specific sizing chart for each. Just because you're a medium in one brand doesn't mean you'll be a medium in another!"

      "content": "Find out the return policy before you buy anything. Whether you're buying in-person or online, find out the company's return policy for lingerie before making a purchase. Since lingerie is worn so close to private areas of the body, many companies may have particular rules about what can and cannot be returned."

      "title": "Keep your receipt and leave the tags on.",
      "content": "Keep your receipt and leave the tags on. If your garter belt doesn't fit the way you expected once you get it home, having your receipt will make returning/exchanging it much easier. Until you're sure the garter belt fits, don't remove the tags or any of the protective coverings on the garter belt."

      "title": "Wear the belt around your waist for comfort and security.",
      "content": "Wear the belt around your waist for comfort and security. For everyday wear, choose a belt that fits around the narrowest part of your waist. Make sure it's snug but comfortable. If it’s too tight, it may pinch your skin painfully, and if it’s too loose, it will slide down past your hips. It should fit snugly around your waist, but still feel comfortable. Since it's sitting at your waist, your hips provide extra security against it sliding down."

      "title": "Put on the garter belt before rolling on your stockings.",
      "content": "Put on the garter belt before rolling on your stockings. Make sure the belt is securely in place before you go through the hassle of hooking and clipping everything. Slide the belt on just like you would panties, then make all your adjustments – the hook-eyes in the back, where it’s situated on your waist, and so on. Once you’re happy with the fit, roll on your stockings. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Adjust the straps to the appropriate length once your stockings are on.",
      "content": "Adjust the straps to the appropriate length once your stockings are on. The garters should hang down about one-quarter to one-third of the way down your thighs, just past the tops of your stockings. Use the sliding mechanism to adjust them, if necessary, then hook them into place. Once clasped onto your stockings, adjust the straps a little more, if needed, until everything feels secure.

      "title": "Wear panties that don’t sit higher than the belt on your waist.",
      "content": "Wear panties that don’t sit higher than the belt on your waist. Garter belts are traditionally worn with panties, and oftentimes will be sold with a matching pair. The panties should not come up higher than the belt on your waist or be visible at all above the belt. If you want, you can skip the panties altogether – it’s up to you."
