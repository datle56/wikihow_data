It's your intention that by performing this prayer, you'll draw closer to Allah and please Him. Having your niyyah in your mind will help you concentrate on all parts of the Witr with the proper respect and devotion. [1] X Research source When praying the Witr (and whenever you pray in Islam ), men should wear pants that go all the way down to their ankles. Women should wear clothes that cover their entire body except for their face and hands."

      "content": "Perform at least one prayer unit or rak’ah during Witr. A rak'ah is a unit of prayer and an essential part of any Islamic prayer session. During a typical rak'ah , the person praying stands for a while, then bows down (in a movement called the ruku ), straightens back up, then prostrates themselves fully on the ground (in a movement called the sujud ). [3] X Research source Start in a standing position. Place your hands over your navel and cover your left hand with your right hand. Look at the floor and say, \"How perfect you are, O Allah. I praise you. How blessed is Your name. How lofty is Your position. And none has the right to be worshipped but You.\" Say, \"‘I seek refuge in Allah from the accursed Shaytan (devil),\" then recite the Surah Fatihah, the first chapter of the Qu'ran. \"In the name of God, the infinitely Compassionate and Merciful. Praise be to Allah, Lord of all the worlds. The Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. Master on the Day of Recompense (Judgement Day). You alone do we worship, and You alone do we ask for help. Guide us on the straight path, the path of those who You have bestowed favor, not of those who have evoked [Your] anger or of those who are astray.\" Perform the ruku position by bending at the waist with your back straight, resting your hands on your knees, and gazing at the floor. Recite, \"How perfect is my Lord, the Magnificent\" 3 times. Straighten back into a standing position, raise your hands up next to your ears, and say, \"Allah hears those who praise him.\" Then lower your hands to your waist and say, \"Our Lord, to You is all praise.\" Prostrate yourself in the sujud position. Lower yourself to your knees and kneel forward until your forehead, nose, palms, knees, and big toes are on the ground. While in sujud , say, \"How perfect is my Lord, the Most High\" 3 times. Raise yourself into a sitting position while saying, \"Allahu Ackbar.\" Sit on your left leg and place your hands on your knees. Then ask Allah for forgiveness in your own words or by reciting a dua , an Islamic prayer of supplication (i.e., asking Allah for help), like, \"O my Lord, forgive me.\" Return to the sujud position and repeat the phrase, \"How perfect is my Lord, the Most High\" 3 more times. Stand up and say \"Allahu Ackbar.\" You've now reached the end of the rak'ah!"

If you perform more than 1 rak'ah during your Witr (which we explain how to do below ), you'll still recite the tasleem at the end of all the rak'ahs in most cases.

Below is a brief guide to performing each number of rak'ah and which prayers to say between and after each prayer unit.: [4] X Research source 3 rak’ah Witr prayer. Here are 2 options for performing the 3 rak’ahs during the Witr. Option 1 : Pray 3 rak’ah in a row, then offer 2 final prayers called tashahhud and tasleem . The tashahhud is a declaration of faith while tasleem is the proper conclusion of any prayer, not just the Witr. Option 2 : Say the tashahhud and tasleem after performing two rak’ah, then again after praying the final rak’ah . 5 or 7 rak’ah of Witr. If you want to perform a 5 or 7 rak’ah Witr, perform the rak’ah in succession, then offer one tashahhud and say the tasleem at the end. 9 rak’ah Witr. Perform 7 rak’ah one after another without breaking. After the 8th rak’ah , perform the tashahhud . In the 9th rak’ah, offer the final tashahhud and say tasleem afterward. 11 rak’ah Witr.

Peace be upon you, O Prophet, and the mercy of Allah and His blessings. Peace be upon us, and on the righteous slaves of Allah. I bear witness that none has the right to be worshipped except Allah, and I bear witness that Muhammad is His slave and Messenger.\" If you just finished praying the last rak'ah in the Witr, add these words to the end of the tashahhud : \"O Allah, send prayers upon Muhammad and upon the family (or followers) of Muhammad, just as You sent prayers upon Ibrahim and the family (or followers) of Ibrahim.

If you think you can wake up before dawn, you could wake up and pray before the first mandatory daily prayer (called Fajr). If you're worried about sleeping through dawn, perform Witr before you go to bed. [7] X Research source Remember to make time for Witr while traveling. When the Prophet traveled, he still performed Witr, so it's a good idea for you to do the same! Why do we pray the Witr at night? Nighttime is a wonderful time to affirm your connection with Allah. As Mohsin says, \"... once I've settled in [at night]… everybody's getting ready for bed…. What happens? I have to [pray] one more time before I go to sleep.

According to the Prophet Muhammad, Muslims are only obligated to perform the 5 daily prayers ( Fajr , Dhuhr , Asr , Maghrib , and Isha ). However, saying optional prayers like the Witr is lauded because it's considered sunnah , a confirmed action the Prophet performed during his lifetime. The Prophet instructed his followers to perform the Witr, and if he missed the Witr because of sleep or illness, he would perform 12 rak'ahs the following day to make up for it. [8] X Research source If you miss the Witr or don't feel compelled to perform it, that's okay!

Mohsin says if you want to be a better Muslim, \"the best thing to do… is to get closer to Allah, and to realize the Presence of Allah.\" Thus, saying the Witr even though it's optional is a good tool to use to achieve your goal."
