      "content": "Take gently-worn leather goods to be fixed professionally. Cobblers and general shoe and bag repair shops often have the equipment to make repairs including patching, stitching and stretching and can restore your leather goods to extend their life. Don’t buy new: fix your favourites instead as a sustainable option. Repairing is a good choice if the damage is minor and you don’t want to say goodbye to the item just yet. Most repairs are straightforward with the correct equipment and can be done while you wait. Some cobblers offer a full treatment service for leather which might take a few days to complete. Avoid restoring leather goods at home because of the chemicals used in the manufacturing process."

      "content": "Take leather scraps to a recycling outlet for resale. The environment will thank you for taking leather scraps to be resold to others for many purposes including craft projects. Some industrial level companies also recycle leather to be used again in their products. [1] X Research source businessrecycling.com.au/recycle/leather Check what specific items can be recycled by ringing your local recycling centre. All centres have different rules about what can and cannot be accepted, and how to best prepare your items for recycling such as cleaning them first at home. Reduce waste in the process. 70 pounds of textiles per person per year are thrown out with only 15% repurposed. If you can't recycle them, take leather scraps to a local organisation such as a school, theatre group or non-profit who can always find new uses for old items. Reduce the amount of reusable items simply going to landfill."

      "content": "Use your old belts to make a ‘shelf’. Once you have finished wearing a belt, you can still use it in a variety of handy ways around the home, including to create a unique hanging shelf. It’s easy, cheap and saves space in your bedroom, bathroom or TV room. [3] X Research source Begin by using two or more leather belts and a simple wood shelf sourced from recycled pallet wood. Choose belts that complement each other in colour. A long black belt and a couple of shorter, dark brown belts work well. Secure the leather belts to the shelves using glue or a staple gun to create straps that are solid and sturdy. Hang the straps from a metallic hook attached to the wall using a hammer and arrange the shelf to sit at a 90 degree angle against the wall. Adjust the straps to the right height for easy access to the shelf to hold books, bottles or ornaments."

      "content": "Create funky new handles for a handbag. You can cut leather scraps into small strips to be used as handbag handles simply by using a ruler and a craft knife. [4] X Research source Lay the leather down grain side up and use the ruler edge as a cutting line. Make lots of small passes with the knife for thick leather. Pin the leather strips to the bag at the top where the sides join together. Remove any existing handles first to give yourself space to work. Sew the new handles on using a heavy duty sewing machine and a fresh needle. Every stitch leaves a permanent hole so plan your sewing in advance using tailor’s chalk to mark out where you plan to stitch. Alternatively you can use a strong glue to hold them in place. Be sure to allow the glue to dry before using the bag."
