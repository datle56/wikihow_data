      "content": "A gray and/or white coating that's powdery, fuzzy, or mushy If you see a white powder, that may be a sign of powdery mildew, which is a type of mold that is dangerous to consume. You may also see dark green or brown spots, white fuzz, or yellow and brown leaves. These are all also signs of mold. [1] X Research source Bud rot, or botrytis cinerea , contributes to a lot of the discoloration in moldy weed. It is a mold disease that’s extremely dangerous to cannabis plants. It's only noticeable after the mold has begun breaking down the plant. [2] X Research source Gray or white mush with yellow and brown leaves indicates of bud rot. Don’t confuse white powder with trichomes. Trichomes are shiny, crystal structures that are spread throughout the surface of cannabis flowers. Moldy weed, on the other hand, is clustered with a dusty, fuzzy look. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "A musty or mildew scent that smells like a damp basement If the mold is well developed, you may smell something similar to hay, pee, or sweat. The smell may seem off to your nose, especially compared to regular weed. Regular weed usually has an earthy, skunky aroma. If you open up a pack and your nose is greeted with a whiff of gym sweat, skunk, and morning mildew, it may be best to discard it.

      "content": "For the sake of your health, don’t smoke moldy weed. Even if you don’t notice any initial negative effects, that doesn’t mean smoking moldy weed is safe. You can’t always tell how much the mold has spread through your weed. Mold spores can be microscopic, which means they may be present in your weed even if you don’t see it. Even if you pick off the moldy chunk, you don’t know how much it has spread. So, if you notice signs of moldy weed in your stash or feel unsure about smoking it because of a weird smell or look, it’s best to get rid of it in favor of your health. [7] X Research source"

Although decarboxylation (the process of heating weed to activate the THC compound) is rumored to get rid of mold in weed, there are species of mold that thrive in heat, like Aspergillus, that will still be present in your weed after the fact. Although you may be tempted to take the moldy chunk off of your weed and smoke the rest, this may not be safe, as mold spores can spread through the buds without being seen.To stay safe and healthy, it is best to not consume weed that has molded.

      "content": "To prevent moldy weed, store your stash in a cool, dry, dark area. Areas with high humidity and moisture are ideal for mold growth. To prevent your weed from being exposed to moisture-inducing conditions, keep it in an airtight container in a dry, dark area like a cabinet or drawer. Too much light exposure can degrade your weed or generate heat that leads to humid conditions, so don’t let it sit in the sun all day. Weed does best at 59-63% humidity around room temperature, so keep it around there to avoid mould growth. [13] X Research source If stored in warm and moist conditions, mold can start growing on weed in as little as 24 hours. [14] X Trustworthy Source Federal Emergency Management Agency Federal agency responsible for coordinating responses to disasters and states of emergency Go to source If left in warm, moist conditions, your weed may begin to grow mold. [15] X Research source Don’t use a fridge or freezer to store your weed, as the low temperature and exposure to moisture can facilitate mold. [16] X Research source Use a mason jar or a weed-specific container to store your weed, they are airtight! It's best to purchase weed from a licensed dispensary since their storage and handling processes are designed with optimum quality in mind."
