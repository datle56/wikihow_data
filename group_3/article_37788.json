      "content": "Combine different rose colors to convey two meanings at once. If you can’t decide on just one meaning for your arrangement of roses , then you can combine multiple hues to personalize the message of your bouquet! There are two ways to do this: you can simply combine two different varieties of roses in a single bouquet, or you can choose multicolored roses that feature one or more colors on their petals. [19] X Research source For example, if you wanted to convey both friendship and love, you might make a bouquet with a mix of yellow and red roses, or you might choose a bouquet of roses that have yellow petals but red tips. Similarly, you can combine pink and orange roses in one bouquet to convey both affection and excitement, or you can choose a bouquet of roses with a pink-orange swirl on their petals. Aside from meaning, Walker also recommends considering the overall mood when combining floral colors. “If you want a moody-hued arrangement, for instance, I would choose more of a gray or deep green, and then choose…more dusty…or deep colors.” Or you can do a “high contrast to the flower for a more happy or bright mood,” continues Walker, “because then you get that super high contrast of a bright green with a fuschia or a bright yellow.”"

      "title": "Weddings",
      "content": "Weddings If you’re picking out rose colors for a wedding, consider each color’s symbolism as well as the wedding’s overall color palette. Some of the most common rose colors for weddings include white, red, and pink, largely due to their associations with love, romance, purity, and affection. So, if you’d like a more traditional look for your wedding flowers, then these shades make for an excellent choice. [20] X Research source However, it’s also important to consider the wedding’s overall theme and color palette. For instance, if the color palette is lavender and green, using yellow roses as decor may create a clashing or busy effect. Similarly, if a wedding has a dark, moody theme, then black or burgundy roses may be more appropriate than peach or orange shades. It’s important to carefully consider the shade (or shades) of roses used for a wedding. Roses are used extensively in many weddings, from the altar backdrop and the bridal bouquet to the table centerpieces and groomsmen’s boutonnieres."

      "title": "Valentine’s Day",
      "content": "Valentine’s Day The most traditional rose colors to give on Valentine’s Day are red, pink, and white roses since all of these colors are associated with love and romantic relationships. However, the exact shade you choose may depend on the exact nature of the relationship you have with the recipient. For instance, you might give red roses to a committed romantic partner and pink roses to a partner you’re happy with or whom you have a secret crush on. [21] X Research source White roses , similarly, are great for a new relationship or a pair of young lovers. Other appropriate rose colors for Valentine’s Day include orange roses (which show enthusiasm or the desire to transition a friendship to a romantic relationship), lavender roses (which express enchantment and love at first sight), and salmon roses (which show desire and excitement). It may be worth straying from the traditional Valentine’s Day rose colors to further personalize your gifted bouquet. For example, consider choosing roses according to the recipient’s favorite color or the shade associated with their birthday month or astrological sign. Zúñiga emphasizes the importance of considering someone’s mood and personality when choosing the right roses for them. “If this is somebody who’s very goth, then sending red roses that are almost bloody or black [roses] to cheer them up will work because that’s what they like.” Alternatively, continues Zúñiga, “Somebody else might appreciate cheerful colors, bright colors, or lighter colors to better elevate their mood.”"

      "content": "Anniversaries Similar to Valentine’s Day, the best roses for relationship and wedding anniversaries are those that signify love, like red, pink, white, and purple roses. Red roses are the traditional choice for anniversaries since they represent deep romantic love—the darker the shade of red, the more intense the love expressed. Other colors, like pink, white, and purple, can represent harmonious love, young love, and love at first sight, respectively. [22] X Research source You could also cater the amount of roses in your bouquet to the amount of years (or months) that you and your partner have been together. For example, arrange eight roses into your bouquet for your 8th wedding anniversary."

      "content": "Funerals White roses are the most common hue chosen for funerals. Because white roses symbolize purity and peace, they’re generally considered to be the most appropriate shade for memorializing a deceased loved one. However, pink roses may also be used to express admiration or black roses may be chosen to express grief and mourning. Keep differing cultural associations in mind when choosing colors, warns Zúñiga. “In certain cultures, certain colors can represent negative emotion. White can in and of itself represent death, so sometimes people will want white and some cultures actually don’t want white for a funeral service.” Zúñiga recommends thinking about if “part of [your] family happens to be in this culture…[and] doing a quick Google search…[to] find out if this color is going to offend them if it’s used in the decor or arrangement.”"

      "title": "Rose colors are natural or artificial through cross-breeding and dying.",
      "content": "Rose colors are natural or artificial through cross-breeding and dying. Some rose colors are natural, meaning that they grow naturally in nature without any human intervention. Natural rose colors include red, pink, white, yellow, orange, and lavender (among others). New shades can also be developed naturally through a process called cross-pollination , where one flower pollinates another with the help of wind, rain, and pollinating insects. [25] X Research source Other varieties are artificial, leading to unnatural shades like blue , green, black, rainbow, and more. These shades are typically created through a color-dying process using absorption, spray, or dip dyes. [26] X Research source Absorption dyes work by placing white or light-colored roses in a solution of warm water and plant-based dye. This liquid is absorbed through the roses’ stems, and the pigment eventually works its way up to color the petals. This same effect can sometimes be achieved with food coloring . Spray and dip dyes also achieve a vibrant petal shade, but they’re applied directly to the petals rather than absorbed. Spray dyes also sometimes have the added benefits of helping rose blooms last longer and retain more moisture."

      "content": "What do 12 roses symbolize? A bouquet of 12 roses (or a dozen roses) represents a romantic gesture symbolizing love, commitment, and a desire for eternal love.

      "content": "What do 7 roses symbolize? A bouquet of 7 roses may symbolize infatuation, admiration, or appreciation. A bit more subtle and nuanced than the traditional dozen, an arrangement of seven roses may convey that someone is infatuated with you or that you have a secret admirer. While the exact origin of this symbolism isn’t certain, it’s possible that the cultural connection between the number 7 and good fortune may have something to do with it—i.e., giving someone seven roses is a way to express how lucky you feel to know them.
