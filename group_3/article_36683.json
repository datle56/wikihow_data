      "content": "There are strange apps installed on your iPhone. Swipe left on your Home screen until you get to the screen that says \"App Library\" on top. Tap App Library and scroll through your list of apps. If there's anything on this list you don't remember installing, your phone may have been hacked. Apple is fairly strict about the apps it allows on the App Store. If you've jailbroken your iPhone or have downloaded apps from anywhere other than the App Store, you're more likely to wind up with shady apps on your phone. If you share your iPhone with someone else (or are using Family Sharing features), apps you don't recognize may have been installed by someone you actually trust. Before you panic, check with other members of your family to see if anyone installed the unfamiliar apps."

      "title": "You're seeing scary pop-up messages.",
      "content": "You're seeing scary pop-up messages. Pop-ups don't always mean your phone is hacked, but they could indicate that your phone is infected with malware or spyware—especially if you see the pop-ups when you're not actively browsing the web. If you're browsing the web and see a pop-up that says \"Your iPhone has been compromised!\" or \"We have detected that your browser is infected with a trojan virus,\" this doesn't mean you were really hacked. In most cases, these pop-ups appear when you click on a website that's malicious (or has been hacked). Never click a link or provide any sort of payment in response to one of these pop-up messages. You should never have to pay to remove any sort of virus from an iPhone."

      "content": "There are unfamiliar configuration profiles in your settings. A configuration profile is a group of settings that can manage email accounts, passwords, and other sensitive data. Sometimes your work or school will require you to install a configuration profile so you can log into their services remotely. However, a hacker could also trick you into installing a profile that gives them access to your phone. Here's how to check: Open your Settings , tap General , and then tap Profiles & Device Management . [1] X Research source If you see any profiles you don't recognize, a hacker may have tricked you into installing it. If you don't see this section in your Settings at all, don't panic. It just means you don't have any configuration profiles installed."

      "title": "Your contacts are receiving messages that you didn't send.",
      "content": "Your contacts are receiving messages that you didn't send. If a hacker has control of your iPhone or Apple ID, they may be using it to contact your friends, family, and possibly even strangers. Check your Messages inbox (and even your Mail outbox) to make sure nobody's sending messages to people and pretending to be you. If you sign into another Apple device (like your family Mac, your partner's iPad, or your child's iPhone) with the same Apple ID you use on this iPhone, you may see the calls and texts they've sent while signed in with your ID. Ask your family members whether they've made the calls or sent the messages before assuming your iPhone is hacked. In this case, it's a good idea to contact your provider and ask for help to recover your account."

Getting strange charges on your phone bill? A hacker (or some bad software) could be taking advantage of your mobile data . Open your Settings app and tap Cellular or Mobile (depending on your region). Scroll down to the \"CELLULAR DATA\" or \"MOBILE DATA\" section to see which apps are using a lot of data. If you see something you don't recognize, be wary."

If your phone seems to heat up a lot, especially when you're not holding it or it's not being charged, there could be malware running in the background. Sometimes your iPhone can get excessively warm when you're playing games or using other CPU-intensive apps—it doesn't always mean you were hacked."

To disconnect quickly, swipe down from the top-right corner of the Home screen (if your iPhone doesn't have a Home button) or swipe up from the bottom (if it does have a Home button), and then tap the airplane icon to go into Airplane Mode.

If your iPhone was hacked, this will remove anything the hacker has installed that helps them keep access to your phone. When you restore from a backup, you're also resetting your iPhone. This erases everything on your iPhone! But as long as you'ved back up or sync your data to iCloud or your computer, you can restore from your backup after resetting."

Resetting your iPhone will get rid of anything shady that's been installed, and any backdoors added by hackers."

Two-factor authentication adds an extra step to the login process, usually requiring you to verify all of your logins via an SMS text or authentication app. Turn on two-factor authentication for your Apple ID account so you'll always be notified when someone tries to log in to any Apple service with your username and password. To turn on two-factor authentication, open Settings , tap your name at the top, tap Password & Security , and then tap Turn on Two-Factor Authentication (if it's not already on)."

Always check an app's reviews in the App Store thoroughly before downloading an app. You can also scroll down to the \"Data Used to Track You\" and \"Data Linked to You\" sections of an app's App Store page to see what type of information this app can learn about you. If an app you've installed asks to access your microphone, camera, Bluetooth, photos, or anything else you don't feel comfortable sharing, deny that app permission when prompted. In some cases, the permission is needed for the app to function, but you can allow it only when the app is being used to minimize risks. If an app or website ever prompts you to install a profile, don't do it—profiles can give hackers access to your phone."

If you connect to any sort of public Wi-Fi network—such as at your school, a café, or even the library—hackers may be able to snoop on what you're doing. This means that entering your banking password or logging in to your online accounts while connected to public Wi-Fi may expose your passwords without your knowledge. You can prevent this by using a VPN any time you use Wi-Fi outside of the networks you know are private and trustworthy."
