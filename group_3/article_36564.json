As soon as you find a fresh urine stain, professional cleaner Susan Stocker says to use a clean cloth to soak up as much excess urine as you can. If it’s on a carpet , mattress , or upholstered furniture item, gently blot the stain instead of rubbing or pressing hard, since this can force the urine deeper into the fabric or cushion. [1] X Expert Source Susan Stocker Professional Cleaner Expert Interview. 8 November 2019. If the urine is on a hard surface , like the floor, simply mop or towel it up. A wet/dry vacuum is also a great option for absorbing the excess urine without forcing it deeper into your carpet or furniture."

Once you’ve blotted up the urine, mix 1 tablespoon (15 mL) of dish soap, 2 cups (470 mL) of cold water, and 1 tablespoon (15 mL) of white vinegar together in a small bowl and stir to combine them. Stocker explains that the vinegar helps break down the uric acid that contributes to the urine smell and neutralize the ammonia-like odor.

Look for a cleaner designed to eliminate urine or pet odors."

Then, slowly work your way toward the edges. Be careful not to press into the surface too hard so you don’t force the urine and cleanser deep into the fabric. [3] X Research source If the urine is on a hard surface , like the floor, simply wipe the area with the cleaning solution and cloth. If you can still see or smell the urine , go over the stain again with more cleaning solution. If you’re using an enzyme cleaner , simply spray it onto the stain and the surrounding area, then let it sit until it is completely dry. Warning : Test the cleanser on an inconspicuous spot before using it on the stain. If it stains or damages the surface you’re trying to clean, you may need to call in a professional cleaner."
