Make sure that both you and your partner keep both hands flat and straight out so that both of you can see how many fingers each person has extended throughout the rest of the game."

For example, you tap your opponent's hand. You have one finger and they have two. They then add the fingers and on their tapped hand, they put out three fingers. On the next turn, your opponent uses their hand of three fingers to tap your hand of one. You now have to hold out four fingers because your one finger plus their three equals four fingers. Only the tapping hand has the power to change your opponent's hand. [1] X Research source"

When someone's hand reaches five fingers that are extended, that hand is considered \"dead\" and is no longer in play. [2] X Research source There are several variations of this rule, but the simple rules of Chopsticks dictate that once a hand has reached five fingers, that hand is useless. Which makes sense because one of background stories behind Chopsticks is that you can hold a chopstick with up to one finger, but an open hand means that you are going to drop your utensil and food as well.

      "content": "Introduce splits into the game. When it's your turn, you can tap your own two hands together to redistribute the number of fingers you have extended. For example, if you have one hand with three fingers and one hand with just one finger and you split them, you can put two fingers on each hand. The goal of this strategy is to prevent one of your hands from reaching five fingers and becoming dead. Splits don't have to be even, but it's preferable. Some odd number combinations merely means swapping fingers between hands with no strategic bonus. However, if you have a combination such as four fingers and one finger on each hand, you can split that into a hand of three and a hand of two. A player can \"revive\" a dead hand by splitting. If you have one hand dead and one alive with four fingers, you can split and put two fingers on each hand to bring your dead hand back into the game. A variation on the splits rule is the \"house rule.\" This rule either means that splits are not allowed or that splits are allowed but can't bring a hand back from the dead. [4] X Research source"

You would not be able to tap their hand if yours has 3 or 4 fingers because that would create a sum of more than 5 fingers on the tapped hand. [5] X Research source This rule is also known as \"exact play.\" This rule allows for the possibility of stalemate if both players have two hands of four points"

Take turns going clockwise or counterclockwise, and keep in mind that you aren't limited to only tapping the people directly next to you. [6] X Research source Adding people will make the game stretch on much longer. This method requires much more focus to win. With so many people playing, there may be a person with a hand about to reach five fingers who splits their fingers and it goes unnoticed by the group. Make sure that everyone is following the same set of rules before starting. There is no wrong way to play but make sure everyone is in agreement with rules before starting a round."

      "content": "Increase the mathematical difficulty by adding nubs. Rather than having fully extended fingers for the whole game, you can used curled fingers or \"nubs.\" Nubs are created by splitting an odd number of fingers on one of your turns. Two nubs equal one finger so it takes longer to make a combination or nubs and full fingers equal enough for a dead hand. Decide if nubs are allowed at the beginning of the game. A desperate player will often add the nubs variant when they are about to lose. An example for splitting fingers into nubs can look like this: there are two fingers on your left hand and three on your right. If you split them, you can put 2.5 fingers or, two fingers and a nub, on either hand. Nubs are most beneficial for when you have a total uneven amount of fingers. You must complete someone's nub in order to make it a full finger. To make a dead hand you must have five full fingers, not four full fingers and one nub."

When using leftovers, you can add three and four fingers together to get 7 fingers, which equals a dead hand plus two more. Sometimes this variation is called \"zombies.\" This rule could make the game could go on forever since you recycle fingers. The only option for a dead hand is that it equals exactly five fingers when tapped. [7] X Research source"
