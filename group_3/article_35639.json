If you have floaters that frequently disrupt your vision, new floaters that suddenly appear, or just have questions about them, talk to your ophthalmologist or physician. These professionals can help you determine if your floaters require medical intervention, based on your symptoms. Although most eye floaters can be chalked up to a normal part of the aging process and treatment for eye floaters is not always needed, some rare cases require targeted medical intervention.
