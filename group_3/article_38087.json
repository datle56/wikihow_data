      "content": "Face any conflict head-on. It might be hard, but take an honest look at your relationship issues. Try to be specific instead of listing things like “we don't get along.” Ask yourself (and discuss with your spouse) focused questions, such as: Have you and your spouse grown apart? Do you have incompatible goals, desires, or visions of the future? Are your physical and emotional needs being met? What about your partner's needs? Do you and your spouse listen to each other? Is your communication limited to short conversations about necessities? Are you dealing with a stressful life event, such as problems at work, financial problems, illness, or the death of a loved one?"

If your conflict is centered on a major violation, such as infidelity, try to identify and address any issues that may have contributed to that violation. [1] X Expert Source Tara Vossenkemper, PhD, LPC Licensed Professional Counselor Expert Interview. 27 October 2021. If you were unfaithful, not only does repairing your marriage mean rebuilding trust; it means confronting possible factors that led to infidelity. For instance, maybe you felt ignored by your spouse. Keep in mind placing blame isn't productive. Instead of saying, “I cheated because you were emotionally unavailable,” say, “What I did was wrong, and I am so sorry. I'd like to work on regaining your trust.” Reader Poll: We asked 796 wikiHow readers who’ve cheated, and 60% of them agreed the biggest challenge in rebuilding trust is dealing with the emotional fallout and broken trust.

      "content": "Don’t wait for your partner to bring up concerns. If you feel that something needs to be addressed, talk to your partner about it. Waiting for your spouse to bring up problems, or hoping the problem will just go away if you don’t talk about it, will likely make it worse. If something has happened that hasn’t been addressed, try gently bringing it up: “I think things have been a little tense between us lately after our fight a few weeks ago, and I’m thinking maybe we could sit and talk about it. How about tonight over dinner?” If you sense something is amiss in your partner, ask them about it instead of assuming it’ll blow over or that they’ll bring it up: “You’ve seemed a little withdrawn lately. Is anything going on?”"

Keep in mind both partners need to put an effort into resolving a relationship's difficulties. [2] X Research source Try drawing a line down the middle of a sheet of paper. On one side, list things you could work on and, on the other, list things your spouse could do. You and your spouse could each make lists, then compare them with each other. For instance, you might write that you need to focus less on work or stop ordering your partner around. Maybe you'd like your partner to contribute more to maintaining your home and raising your kids."

      "content": "Root your complaints in your own feelings and voice criticism respectfully. All spouses get annoyed with each other and complain about pet peeves, but personal attacks will likely only widen the gap between you both. Instead, take responsibility for your feelings and respectfully explain what changes you’d like to see in your partner. [3] X Expert Source Tara Vossenkemper, PhD, LPC Licensed Professional Counselor Expert Interview. 27 October 2021. Licensed Professional Counselor Tara Vossenkemper advises using \"I\" language over \"you\" language: \"If I say to my partner something like, 'Why don't you ever do the dishes?'...that's much different than me saying, 'I'm feeling kind of resentful about this. The weight of this burden does not feel equally distributed. Can you help me fix this?'\" [4] X Expert Source Tara Vossenkemper, PhD, LPC Licensed Professional Counselor Expert Interview. 27 October 2021.

In order to save your marriage, you and your spouse both need to keep your emotions in check.

As tough as it is, resist the urge to fight, and think about your spouse's message. If your spouse is shouting, say, “I understand that you're upset, and I feel like yelling, too. But screaming at each other isn't going to get us anywhere. Let's cool down and show each other respect.”"

      "content": "Stonewalling is when a partner shuts down or gives the silent treatment. You and your spouse won’t be able to resolve conflicts without practicing open communication. If one or both of you shut down, this can prevent you from communicating effectively.

Try saying, “I know it can be tough to work through problems, and it's easier just to ignore each other. If we're going to make it, we have to set a rule that we talk things through instead of putting up walls.” It's okay to take time to cool down instead of discussing things in the heat of an argument. However, don't just ignore each other. Instead, say, “I think we should cool down for a bit, then talk this through when we're both calm.”"

Do your best to show them empathy instead of responding with anger. [9] X Research source For instance, if your partner is short with you, maybe they had a hard day at work. If they aren't talking to you, maybe they're sad, not angry. Try saying, “I love you, and I don't want us to shut each other out. We need to let each other in, and stop assuming that we know what the other is thinking.”"

It might take some time for deeper conversations to come naturally, so have patience. As you go about your day, note news stories, funny things you see, and other potential conversation starters. Additionally, let your spouse vent about their day to you. You don't necessarily need to give them advice or analysis. Providing each other a shoulder to lean on can help you rebuild your bond."

      "content": "Dredging up the past is unlikely to help you argue productively. It can be tempting to bring up something that happened 10 years ago when arguing with your spouse. But resolving conflicts isn't about winning: instead, aim to make your point calmly and rationally, and work with your spouse to find a compromise. [12] X Research source “The most common relationship problems are not things,” Vossenkemper says. “They are methods of communication. And so people will argue about the most asinine things, but they're not arguing about that thing. They are kind of arguing about the way that they're talking about that thing.” [13] X Expert Source Tara Vossenkemper, PhD, LPC Licensed Professional Counselor Expert Interview. 27 October 2021. If you constantly dredge up old dirt on your spouse, they'll feel attacked instead of involved in a discussion. As difficult as it is, try to forgive them for hurting you in the past. Focus on your marriage's present and future."

Remind yourself that you and your partner have shared many wonderful moments, and there's a reason you've invested so much in each other. It's tough to rebuild a connection after years of monotony, stress, arguments, and everything else that comes with a marriage.

[14] X Trustworthy Source American Psychological Association Leading scientific and professional organization of licensed psychologists Go to source For example, you could slip a note into their bag before they leave for work that says, “Have a fantastic day!

If you have kids, ask your parents, in-laws, or a babysitter to watch them so you can spend quality time with your spouse. Vossenkemper points out that you don't need to make big plans to have a nice time. Just take time for each other when and however you can: \"It might also just be like drinking wine after the kids go to bed.\" [16] X Expert Source Tara Vossenkemper, PhD, LPC Licensed Professional Counselor Expert Interview. 27 October 2021."

Say, “I'd like us to be honest about what we need from each other. I want to fulfill your emotional and physical needs, and we both need to let each other know how to be the best partner.” It's scary to make yourself vulnerable and say, “I need you to tell me that you love me and find me attractive,” or “I want to try something new in the bedroom.” But having the courage to make yourselves vulnerable might be exactly what you both need to deepen your bond."

As you grow more comfortable being physically intimate, work on touching each other, kissing, and, eventually, having sex more often. [19] X Research source Check in with your spouse to make sure they're comfortable. You might say, “Do you mind if I hold your hand?” while watching a movie, or ask if they want a back rub after a long day."

A counselor can offer an objective perspective and help you develop the skills needed to mend the gap in your relationship. [20] X Research source It's particularly wise to seek counseling if you're dealing with issues like infidelity, addiction, or contempt. Try not to be nervous or self-conscious about seeing a counselor or therapist. Many couples get help from a professional."
