      "title": "Measure the length and width of the heel tip in millimeters.",
      "content": "Measure the length and width of the heel tip in millimeters. This is very important, as some heel tips have a slightly elongated shape. [2] X Research source If you are having troubles measuring in millimeters, measure in centimeters, then convert to millimeters."

      "title": "Purchase a set of new heel tips.",
      "content": "Purchase a set of new heel tips. Look for something called “High Heel Rubber Tip Replacement Dowels.” [3] X Research source These heel tips are not the same as the slip-on kind. They are a permanent tip and come with a nail to hammer into the heel. Make sure that you purchase the correct size and shape. Do not round sizes, otherwise the heel tip will not fit."

      "title": "Use long, needle nose pliers to remove the plastic heel tip.",
      "content": "Use long, needle nose pliers to remove the plastic heel tip. Grip the edge of the old heel tip with a set of long, needle nose pliers. Twist the heel tip while pulling on it. Be careful not to break off the nail. You need to have the hole clear, otherwise you won't be able to insert the new heel tip. [4] X Research source If you are replacing old, worn-out heel tips, you may have to cut away the old tip with a blade first, then pull the screw out with pliers. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Smooth out the surface, if needed.",
      "content": "Smooth out the surface, if needed. This may not be necessary if you pulled out a new, intact heel tip. If you sliced away an old, worn-out tip, there may be some residue. Sand this residue off with sandpaper or a dremel. Keep in mind that you may have to get a thicker rubber heel tip to make up for the loss of height. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Wipe the bare heel tip clean. A damp rag will do, but rubbing alcohol will work even better. This will remove any dirt or oils. [7] X Research source You should definitely do this if you sanded the heel."

      "content": "Use a lightweight hammer to tap the new tip onto the heel. Insert the new tip's nail into the hole on the heel. Make sure that it is oriented in the right direction, then tap it into place with a lightweight hammer. Keep going until the tip is flush against the heel; you should not see any gaps. [8] X Research source Coat the nail with super glue first. This will help it stick better. [9] X Research source If the heel tip is too large, lightly sand the edges after you hammer it into place.

      "content": "Measure the length and width of the heel tip. It is best to take measurements in millimeter, inches, and centimeters, as there is no guarantee which the brand will use. Also, take note of the shape of your heel: round, oval, or semi-circle. This method will work the best on worn-out heel tips, but you can try it on regular ones. It might be a good idea to sand the tip down until you see the metal nail, however."

Make sure that the bottom edge of the tape is aligned with the bottom edge of the heel. [12] X Research source Make sure that you wrap the tape tightly so that it stretches. You only need to overlap it by ¼ to ½ inch (0.64 to 1.27 centimeters), depending on the thickness of the heel. The thicker the heel, the longer the overlap."
