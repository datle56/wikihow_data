      "content": "Make sure you’re ready to have sex before you dive in. Even if you’ve had sex before, taking the plunge with someone new can be nerve-wracking, but you can take all the time that you need. Psychotherapist Kelli Miller says “you really want to make this decision without feeling any type of pressure, either societal pressure [or] partner pressure.” [1] X Expert Source Kelli Miller, LCSW, MSW Psychotherapist Expert Interview. 21 July 2020. Ask yourself things like: [2] X Research source Am I really ready to have sex, or am I feeling pressured by my partner/friends? Do I feel comfortable having sex with my partner? Could I have any regrets afterward? Have we talked about using protection during sex? Do I feel comfortable saying no at any point?"

      "title": "Real sex probably won’t be like sex in the movies.",
      "content": "Real sex probably won’t be like sex in the movies. If you haven’t had much sex before and you don’t know what to expect, that’s okay! It might be a little awkward, silly, or even downright funny at times. Keep an open mind, and try not to set the bar too high for yourself or for your partner. [3] X Research source Don’t be afraid to giggle or laugh during sex (as long as you aren’t laughing at your partner). Letting out a little chuckle can really help lighten the mood and keep things fun instead of serious. As you get to know your partner more and figure out what you both like, sex will feel more natural and authentic."

      "title": "If you’re still on the fence about intimacy, get some more insight.",
      "content": "If you’re still on the fence about intimacy, get some more insight. Your partner might be going through the same struggles you are, and it can be helpful to talk to someone about what you’re thinking. Ask them how they feel in the relationship, where they’re at with sex, and how long they’d like to wait before getting intimate. [4] X Research source Say something like, “So, we’ve been dating for a little while, and I think I might be ready to have sex. How are you feeling?” It can feel awkward to talk about sex, but by being open and honest, you can make the experience better for both of you. If you don’t feel like you can talk about sex with your partner, it might be better to wait a while before getting intimate with them. Licensed professional counselor Josh Spurlock says that it can also help have “conversations with people that you trust about their experience.” [5] X Expert Source Josh Spurlock, MA, LPC, CST Licensed Professional Counselor Expert Interview. 13 January 2022. Chatting with people who know what they're talking about can help you feel less anxious or nervous."

      "content": "Protect yourself from pregnancy and STDs. Decide ahead of time what kind of control you’re going to use, and make sure it’s ready to go before you plan on having sex. There are tons of different birth control options available, so you can pick the one that’s right for you. Remember that birth control methods like pills and implants protect against pregnancy, but they don’t protect against STDs. Even if you are on birth control, consider getting condoms or dental dams as well."

      "title": "How your body hair looks is up to you.",
      "content": "How your body hair looks is up to you. If you’d like to do some grooming on your genitals , try to do it the day before to avoid any irritation during sex. You can also shave your legs and your armpits, but again, only if you want to. [6] X Research source If you’ve never shaved before and you don’t want to, consider trimming your pubic hair with a razor or scissors, just to tidy it up."

      "title": "Take a shower, brush your teeth, and put on deodorant.",
      "content": "Take a shower, brush your teeth , and put on deodorant. You want to look (and smell) your best during sex, so take some time to clean up before you meet with your partner. Consider taking along some breath mints and a travel deodorant too, just in case you need them. You never know where the mood will strike! [7] X Research source Keep in mind that if you have a vagina, you don’t need to wash it out with soap. You can lightly scrub your vulva with your hands and some water, but using soap or harsh cleansers can disrupt your pH balance and lead to irritation."

      "title": "The last thing you want is to be distracted by a full bladder!",
      "content": "The last thing you want is to be distracted by a full bladder! When the moment strikes, take a pause and head to the bathroom really quickly just to go pee. You can use the time to freshen up and make sure you’re both looking and smelling good, too."

      "title": "Sometimes, you need your mind to get in the mood first.",
      "content": "Sometimes, you need your mind to get in the mood first. After that, having sex will come a little more naturally. If you’re seeing your partner later that day, try thinking about the fact that you’re going to have sex. You could even watch or read something stimulating, like an erotic novel or a steamy movie. The more you can get yourself in the right mindset, the better. [8] X Research source If you aren’t in a sex “mindset,” you might have trouble getting turned on physically when it comes time to do the deed."

    {
      "title": "Put on lingerie or take a luxurious bath.",
      "content": "Put on lingerie or take a luxurious bath. Do something that makes you feel cool and confident to boost your self-image before you have sex. Something that makes you feel more attractive will put you in the right headspace, and you’ll probably feel more ready to get intimate with your partner afterward. [9] X Research source You could also listen to a sensual song, do your makeup, or get all dressed up in a new outfit."

    {
      "title": "Dim the lights and turn on some sensual music.",
      "content": "Dim the lights and turn on some sensual music. If you really want to get into it, try lighting a few candles, too. The more sexy your environment looks and feels, the better headspace you’ll be in when it comes time to do the deed. Don’t be afraid to get a little cheesy, either—rose petals are a cliché for a reason! [10] X Research source You might have some wine or champagne on hand, just in case you and your partner want a drink before getting to it."

      "title": "Communication before, during, and after sex is important.",
      "content": "Communication before, during, and after sex is important. Start out by telling your partner what you’re comfortable with, even if it’s not a lot. After you start getting physical, tell your partner what feels good and what doesn’t. If you can provide some direction, you can ensure that you both have a good time during intimacy. [11] X Research source Make sure you’re listening to your partner as well. Miller says that “our partners aren't mind readers, and we forget that everybody is different [and has] different preferences. What your last partner liked, your current partner may not like.” [12] X Expert Source Kelli Miller, LCSW, MSW Psychotherapist Expert Interview. 17 February 2022. You might say something like, “Let’s start slow” or, “That feels so nice.”"

      "content": "You can tell your partner to stop at any time. Miller says that “if somebody doesn't feel like they want to have sex, they have that right to say no.” [13] X Expert Source Kelli Miller, LCSW, MSW Psychotherapist Expert Interview. 17 February 2022. Even if you’ve already said yes, feel free to back up or ask your partner to stop if you feel uncomfortable. Consent is key, and you don’t have to do anything that you don’t want to do. [14] X Research source Listen to what your partner says, too. They might say “no” or tell you to slow down, so pay attention. Reader Poll: We asked 1249 wikiHow readers who've been intimate, and 50% of them agreed that the best way to discuss boundaries is to let things progress naturally and address boundaries as they arise.
