      "content": "Confess your love when the feeling seems mutual. To determine if the feeling is mutual, pay attention to any signs your partner gives off. As you get to know your partner, you’ll also get to know their feelings towards you. If your partner does things to make you smile, looks at you longingly, and makes you a priority in their life, they likely feel strongly towards you. [1] X Research source For example, if your partner cooks your favorite meal for dinner or talks about their feelings a lot with you, it may be a sign that they love you."

      "content": "Express your feelings when the moment feels right. The perfect time to confess your feelings will come to you intuitively. You’ll know when the time is right, based on your partner’s body language and your personal feelings. Signs that you truly love your partner include making them a priority, not looking for new people, and feeling a strong connection and attraction."

      "title": "Avoid saying “I love you” too soon into your relationship.",
      "content": "Avoid saying “I love you” too soon into your relationship. Typically, you should tell your partner your feelings after you've spent enough time with them to know them well. The amount of time will depend on your particular relationship. Overall, you should wait to tell them you love them until you know your feelings are true and genuine. [2] X Research source While it is wonderful to feel strongly about your partner after a few dates, avoid telling them you love them until you are certain. That way, your affection will not seem desperate or clingy."

      "title": "Don’t wait too long to say how you feel.",
      "content": "Don’t wait too long to say how you feel. If you wait too long, you and your partner may grow apart, resulting in them moving on. They may get the wrong idea and think you're not into them if you don't express your feelings eventually. [3] X Research source Find confidence in your feelings, rather than being scared to express your love. You may regret not opening up down the line. One way to be more confident is to remind yourself that your partner is going to want to hear the L word eventually, even if it's not \"perfect\" ."

      "title": "Give yourself a pep talk before you say “I love you.”",
      "content": "Give yourself a pep talk before you say “I love you.” If you are nervous about telling your partner your feelings, take some deep breaths and talk yourself up. Say to yourself, “I can do this,” or something similar. Remind yourself of all the reasons why you love your partner to distract you from your fear of rejection. With a little reassurance, you can confess your love with confidence and assurance. You can also tell yourself “If it is meant to be, it will be.”"

      "content": "Be face-to-face with your partner to tell them your feelings. The moment you confess your love is a powerful, transformative point in your relationship, as you commit to each other officially. Because of this, you want to clearly see their facial expression and reaction when you confess your feelings. If you can, it is best to tell your partner in person. If that is not possible, try a video call. Avoid saying “I love you” via text or phone call. You will not be able to read your partner’s expressions if you tell them through an indirect form of communication."

      "content": "Look into their eyes. Eye contact is very important. It impresses upon the person at the other end that you are confident about your feelings and do not doubt it. Not maintaining eye-contact is a sign of being unsure."

      "title": "Pick a private place to make the moment intimate and special.",
      "content": "Pick a private place to make the moment intimate and special. Avoid proclaiming your love in front of a lot of people. This may put outside pressure on your partner, which may complicate their feelings. Find a romantic, intimate time to tell your partner how you feel, such as a nice dinner or while spending time at home. For example, you can cuddle with your partner on the couch and look them in the eyes before you say your feelings. While wine can be romantic and set the mood, avoid telling your partner your feelings while intoxicated. You may not say exactly what you mean. Make sure you and your partner are not busy or distracted when you tell them your feelings. They may be stressed about work or school, and this may impact their mood. If you tell your partner your feelings in public, keep your volume low. You can whisper “I love you” into their ear as an intimate expression of love."

      "content": "Say \"I love you\" when the moment feels right. Say that slowly, try not to blush, and just be yourself. The perfect opportunity to confess your feelings will depend on your particular situation. When you feel the right moment has come, be direct and speak clearly. Tell your partner \"I love you,\" with a genuine, warm tone. You can do this while eating dinner, having a picnic, or stargazing, for example. [4] X Research source If you want to say something other than \"I love you,\" consider things like, \"I can't believe how much I care for you,\" or \"I feel such powerful adoration for you and only you.\" These are ways of saying the gist of your feelings without popping the \"L-word.\" Other suggestions include \"You're the best partner in the whole world,\" and \"I love you more and more every day.\""

While of course you want them to say “I love you too,” there is no guarantee. If you feel genuine love for your partner, you should tell them, regardless of how they may respond. Just because your partner doesn't say \"I love you,\" back right away doesn't mean they don't feel strongly toward you.
