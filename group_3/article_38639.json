[3] X Research source If you’re on desktop, you can also drag your photos into the dotted box on the screen to upload them. For the best results, use high-quality photos with good lighting and a clutter-free background."

      "title": "Fill out the listing details.",
      "content": "Fill out the listing details. Give your listing a title, description, price, and other details. When choosing a title, list important descriptive information like the brand, color, and size of the garment. Go into more detail in your description by including things like the item’s measurements and any flaws it may have. Poshmark will also walk you through other required details, like category, quantity, and price. [4] X Research source To increase your chances of making a sale, be as specific as possible when filling out your listing details."

Package the item, attach the shipping label, then drop the package at a post office or in your mailbox. You’ll generally receive payment within a few days of the customer receiving the shipment. [6] X Research source Poshmark provides a flat rate of $7.95 for expedited shipping on all orders under 5 lbs. The buyer typically pays for shipping on Poshmark, but if you offer free or discounted shipping, the price comes out of your total earnings. If the package weighs more than 5 lbs, you’ll have to print a new shipping label that has an upgrade fee. In this case, the fee will come out of your total earnings."

      "content": "Sell trendy clothing. While you can sell any items you like, if you really want to make money selling on Poshmark, it’s a good idea to list trendy, high-quality items. Pay attention to current fashion trends and look for items at thrift stores and garage sales. Look for popular brands, and make sure the clothes are in good condition. [8] X Research source This doesn’t mean you have to look for new clothes. For example, 90s and early-2000s fashion is currently trendy, so older items can actually make you more money! Many Poshmark sellers buy clothing for a couple dollars at a thrift store, then raise the price when they list it so they make a profit. If you’re running a resale business rather than just selling your old clothes, make sure to have a variety of sizes to increase the amount of potential buyers."

    {
      "title": "Take high-quality photos.",
      "content": "Take high-quality photos. Buyers are more likely to check out listings with clear, high-quality photos than listings with blurry or dark photos. To increase your chances of selling your items, use natural lighting and a clean, preferably white background. Show as many angles as possible and zoom in on unique details so buyers can really see the item. Iron or steam press the clothing before photographing them so they’re as pristine as possible. [9] X Research source Have someone model the clothes, hang the item up, or lay it flat to take your pictures. Make sure there is no clutter in the photo. The item you’re selling should be the only thing in the picture. White backgrounds tend to attract more potential buyers. Photograph your items against a white bedsheet or foam board for an easy, cheap option. If the item is particularly high-end, photograph the designer tag, as well."

      "title": "Be honest and descriptive.",
      "content": "Be honest and descriptive. If you forget to mention (intentionally or unintentionally) any imperfections in the item you’re selling, buyers are more likely to dispute the purchase and/or leave a bad review. To prevent this, be as honest and descriptive as possible when listing the item. Make note of any wear and tear, and consider including images of the problem spots. This will help you build trust with other users so you’re more likely to continue to make sales. [10] X Research source In your listing description, mention the item’s condition (new with tags, like new, good, fair, etc.), its fabric, any noticeable flaws, and specific keywords like “brown wide leg pants” that are likely to pull your item into the search bar. If possible, include the brand, color, style, and size of the garment in the title. If you can’t fit this entire description, focus on the ones that are most important, like what you think people will type in the search bar."

      "title": "Share your listings regularly.",
      "content": "Share your listings regularly. When users search for something on Poshmark, the listings are typically arranged by “recently shared,” so most successful resellers suggest sharing all of your listings at least once a day. To do this, go to “My Seller Tools,” then select “Share to Followers” under “Bulk Listing Actions.” Click the filter icon, choose “Available Items,” then click “Select All” and “Share to Followers.” This will help keep your listings fresh at the top of the search results. [11] X Research source Consider sharing other sellers’ listings, as well. They may share yours in return, which can help boost sales."

      "title": "Price competitively and offer discounts.",
      "content": "Price competitively and offer discounts. Before listing an item, search for similar items to see how other sellers are pricing them. If you really want to sell the item, it’s often a good idea to price yours a bit cheaper. Be willing to accept offers from potential buyers, and use the “Price Drop” feature to offer lower prices to users who have liked your listing. [12] X Research source Occasionally, Poshmark offers “Closet Clear Out” specials, during which buyers get discounted shipping (at no cost to you) if you lower the price of a listing by at least 10%. Discounted shipping often makes hesitant buyers more likely to make a purchase."

      "content": "Package your items well. Ensure your items are freshly laundered and wrinkle-free, and wrap them neatly in tissue paper. Make sure your packaging is in good condition, with no noticeable dents or rips. It’s also a good idea to include a thank you note, and many resellers like to add little treats, like candy or stickers, to their shipments. [13] X Research source"

      "content": "Ship orders quickly. Poshmark users can see the average time it takes a seller to ship items, and you’re more likely to make sales if you ship within a few days. Try to have your items ready to go before they sell so all you have to do is put them in the package, attach the shipping label, and drop them off at the post office. [14] X Research source If you know it’s going to take longer than usual for you to ship an item, let the buyer know ahead of time."

      "content": "Be active. Post new listings as often as possible. If you’re trying to make a business by selling on Poshmark, it’s often a good idea to list new items at least once a day. Be sure to respond to any questions or comments left by potential buyers as soon as possible. The more responsive you are, the higher your chances of making a sale. [15] X Research source Turn on email or push notifications so you know when someone makes an offer or a purchase. Offers expire after 24 hours, so this is a great way to make sure you don’t miss out on a sale. If you’re going to be out of town for a while, use the “Vacation Hold” feature under “My Seller Tools.” This allows you to select a start and end date that alerts buyers you’re unavailable and that your listings are temporarily unavailable for purchase."

Returns aren’t allowed unless the item is counterfeit or if it arrives “Not as Described,” meaning the seller didn’t properly disclose a flaw or the item isn’t the size listed. Buyers can’t return items simply because they didn’t like it or it doesn’t fit properly. [19] X Research source If an item does get returned, Poshmark pays for return shipping."

      "title": "They take responsibility for lost packages.",
      "content": "They take responsibility for lost packages. While Poshmark’s 20% fee may seem steep, a lot of the money taken is used to protect both buyers and sellers. If an item gets lost in the mail, Poshmark refunds the buyer and still pays the seller. Many companies would not take on this responsibility, so this is a great way for Poshmark to build trust with their buyers and sellers. [20] X Research source"

[21] X Research source Of course, everyone is different, so it’s up to you to determine if it’s worth the time and effort. If you sell high-quality, marketable items, you’ll likely make some money. If your items are worn out or you only want to get rid of a couple things, it may be better to donate them. The more effort you put into selling on Poshmark, the more likely you’ll earn a decent amount of money. If you don’t want to dedicate a lot of time, it may not be as worth it to you."
