      "content": "Add a small amount of red paint to white paint, then mix well. Start by placing small dollops of red and white paint onto your palette. Next, add a little bit of red to the white, and mix it together thoroughly. Keep adding tiny amounts of red at a time until you reach the shade of pink you want to use for your work. [1] X Research source Always start by adding small bits of red paint to white paint, not the other way around. Adding white to red will take more time and use up lots of paint. For the best results, choose an opaque white (such as Titanium White ). More transparent shades (like Zinc White) may only lighten the red without creating a true pink. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Experiment with different red hues to create specific shades of pink. Each shade of red will produce a different shade of pink, so you may need to experiment to find the right shade for your work. For example, professional painter Jeanine Hattas Wilson explains that Alizarin Crimson , which is a reddish magenta color, will give you “more of a vibrant pink” than other reds will. [3] X Expert Source Jeanine Hattas Wilson Professional Painter Expert Interview. Here’s some more info on the shades of pink you’ll get from various reds: Cadmium reds (light, medium, and deep) will produce a slightly orangey pink. Scarlet Lake will make very bright pink. Alizarin Crimson will produce brilliant pinks with hints of blue and purple. Rose Madder is a transparent hue that will make thinner pinks. Naphthol Red will produce bright, slightly transparent pink. Quinacridone will produce a very bright pink. Earthy reds (including Indian Red and Venetian Red ) will create more muted, natural-looking pinks."

      "title": "Add a complementary color to change the shade of your pink.",
      "content": "Add a complementary color to change the shade of your pink. Darker shade variations are technically created by adding black to a color. However, many painters find that using a complementary color instead of black creates better-looking shades. You can try adding a direct complementary color (a shade of green) to your pink paint mixture, but using a neighboring color like blue can also create nice results. [4] X Research source Start by adding just a little of your complementary color. Mix well, then assess to see how close the pink is to the shade you’re going for. Keep adding a very small amount of the complementary color at a time until you get the shade you want. To make your pink lighter, add more white to make a brighter shade."

      "content": "Select a reddish watercolor shade as your base color. There are a number of readily available watercolor hues that can be used to create beautiful pinks. You can usually use these colors as they are, just thinned out with a bit of water to lighten them to your desired shade. Choose a base color such as: [5] X Research source Permanent Rose Quinacridone Rose Ruby Red"

      "title": "Dilute your base color with water to lighten it.",
      "content": "Dilute your base color with water to lighten it. Watercolors work by allowing the white of the paper to reflect light through the transparent layers of paint applied to them. To create a lighter pink, all you need to do is dilute your base color with water, so that the layer becomes more transparent. Experiment by diluting your paint with various amounts of water on your tray before applying it to your paper. This will give you a feel for the kinds of pink you can make. You can also thoroughly wet your paper first, then apply a small amount of your red to create a pink wash."

      "content": "Add an alternate color to create different shades of pink. Try painting a wash of a color like cobalt blue over a layer of pink to create a cooler-toned pink shade. [6] X Research source Using an alternate color (rather than black) will result in richer, more vibrant pink hues."
