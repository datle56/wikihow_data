      "title": "Find a stem with a node and cut 1 to 2 inches (2-5 cm) below it.",
      "content": "Find a stem with a node and cut 1 to 2 inches (2-5 cm) below it. Look for a healthily growing stem that has other stems, leaves, or a brown aerial root branching off of it. The area where your stem divides and grows is called a node. Simply snip the stem 1 to 2 inches (2-5 cm) below the node with cutting shears or scissors to get your cutting. [1] X Research source Choose a stem with at least 1 leaf on it. The more leaves and nodes your stem has, the faster it is likely to grow. Avoid cutting a stem with any damaged, yellow, or wilting leaves."

      "title": "Fill a glass with water and place your stem cutting inside.",
      "content": "Fill a glass with water and place your stem cutting inside. Find a tall, clear glass or vase that allows your swiss cheese plant cutting to stand upright. Set your cutting inside and pour enough water into the glass so the node and most of the stem are covered. [2] X Research source While you don’t necessarily have to use a clear glass, it lets you watch as the roots grow and can help you monitor for any rotting on the stem or roots."

      "title": "Set your cutting in a location that receives indirect light.",
      "content": "Set your cutting in a location that receives indirect light. Find an area in your home that gets lots of warm light. Just make sure the light isn’t harsh or intense. Swiss cheese plants need lots of light to grow, but direct light can burn their leaves. [3] X Research source If you have a window in your bathroom, that can be a great place to set your monstera cuttings. These plants love humidity, so they’ll definitely appreciate the steamy environment. Change the water in the glass every 3 to 5 days, or when the water becomes cloudy. Monsteras are tropical plants and thrive in climates between 60 to 80° F (15-26° C). If you live in a cooler climate, just be sure to keep your plant away from drafty areas. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Watch as your cutting grows roots over the next 2 months.",
      "content": "Watch as your cutting grows roots over the next 2 months. Most swiss cheese plants start growing roots after about 1 to 2 weeks. However, their roots need to be nice and long before they’re ready to be potted. Be patient as your plant works its magic and continue to monitor its roots for any rotting. Rotting roots look black and squishy. If you notice any root rot, simply trim off the rotting bit. You’ll know it’s time to pot your cutting when its roots have grown almost as long and thick as the stem."

      "title": "Plant your cutting in soil once it has lots of thick, white roots.",
      "content": "Plant your cutting in soil once it has lots of thick, white roots. Choose a pot with drainage holes that’s at least 5 inches (12 cm) deep and wide. Fill it about half-way full with well-draining soil . Place the cutting inside and fill the rest of the pot with soil. Then, give your new swiss cheese plant a thorough drink of water. [5] X Research source Set your new plant in front of a sunny window that doesn’t get harsh, direct light. [6] X Research source Let your monstera dry out between waterings. You can tell that it's time to water by sticking your finger about 1 to 2 inches (2-5 cm) deep into the soil. If it's dry, water your plant. [7] X Research source It’s totally normal for your monstera to droop a little as it gets used to being in soil. [8] X Research source You can also choose to let your plant grow in water! Swiss cheese plants definitely prefer soil, but they can survive for several years in water too. Just make sure to regularly change the water once it's cloudy and transfer it to a bigger vase when its roots start to overtake its current glass. [9] X Research source"

Add your cutting into the hole so that the node and the bottom of the stem are covered by soil. Then, gently pack the soil around the cutting so that it stands up straight. [12] X Research source To help your cutting root and grow faster, dip the bottom of the stem in a rooting hormone before you plant it."

      "title": "Place the cutting in a sunny location and keep its soil moist.",
      "content": "Place the cutting in a sunny location and keep its soil moist. Choose a window where your swiss cheese plant cutting will get lots of warm, indirect light. Every few days, check if the soil is dry by sticking your finger about 1 to 2 inches (2-5 cm) deep into the soil. If it feels dry, water your cutting again to keep the soil moist. [13] X Research source It’s completely normal for your cutting to look dry or wilt during the first couple of weeks after being planted. Your cutting currently has no roots to absorb the water, but it’s busy developing them! Because monsteras love humid environments, you can place a plastic bag over your cutting and pot to lock in moisture. This can help its roots grow faster, but it’s not necessary. Just remove the bag when you water."

      "title": "Watch for new growth forming on your cutting.",
      "content": "Watch for new growth forming on your cutting. Because the bottom of your cutting is covered in soil, it can be difficult to know when its roots have fully formed. The best way to tell if your cutting is growing is to look for new, bright green leaves sprouting. [14] X Research source This process generally takes longer than water propagation, as it might be 2 months or longer before you see new growth. You can gently tug on your cutting after it's been planted for about a month to see if it’s grown roots. If you feel slight resistance, that likely means it has roots. Be very careful when pulling at your cutting, as its baby roots are very delicate."

Repot your swiss cheese plant in a pot with drainage holes that’s at least 1 to 2 inches (2-5 cm) taller and wider than the pot it was in. Tilt your current pot and gently twist and pull the plant to get it out. Then, fill the new pot about half-way with well-draining soil. Simply place your plant in the new pot and fill the rest of it with soil. Then give your new plant a good soak! [15] X Research source Depending on the size of your cutting and the pot you chose, your new swiss cheese plant might not need to be repotted quite yet. However, these plants typically grow quickly, so if its roots are growing out of the bottom of the container and it looks like it's overgrowing its pot, it's a good idea to transplant."

      "content": "Fill a clear glass with sphagnum moss . Moss is a great potting medium for swiss cheese plants that keeps your cutting moist and encourages root growth. Simply fill a clear glass all the way full with the moss. [17] X Research source Propagating with moss is often recommended for more delicate monstera plants like variegated species. You can use perlite or Lightweight Expanded Clay Aggregate (LECA) instead of moss. Propagating with these materials is about the same as with moss, just add about 1 to 2 inches (2-5 cm) of water to your glass."

Set your cutting in front of a sunny window that receives indirect light so you can watch as it forms roots! [18] X Research source Re-moisten your moss when you see that it's dry. Dried out moss will look lighter brown than moist moss. You can also stick your finger about 1 to 2 inches (2-5 cm) deep into the moss to see if it feels dry. To lock in moisture and give your monstera the humid environment it loves, place a plastic bag over your cutting and your glass. This isn’t necessary, but it might help your plant grow roots faster. Dip the bottom of your cutting in a rooting hormone before you plant it to help it grow faster."

Finish off by filling the rest of the pot with soil and giving your cutting a thorough drink of water. You now have a new swiss cheese plant!

[25] X Research source You want to keep the top of the moss and stem uncovered so you can moisten the moss when it dries out. When the moss turns a light brown or feels dry, give it a misting of water to moisten it. Alternatively, you can add your moist moss to a plastic bag. Just wrap the bag and moss around the node and secure it with twist ties. Keep the bag open so you can moisten the moss and give the stem and node some air-flow. [26] X Research source"
