      "title": "Choose a substance to assist in removal.",
      "content": "Choose a substance to assist in removal. There are many different substances you can use to make an adhesive bandage come off more easily. These substances lubricate the bandage and/or dissolve the adhesive. Choose one you have around the house, or purchase one. The following have been found to be effective: Petroleum jelly Baby oil Vegetable oil [1] X Research source Salt water"

      "content": "Hold the baby so the bandaged area is stationary and accessible. Hold the baby still, or have a partner hold the child, so that you can easily access the bandage."
    },
    {
      "title": "Apply the remover.",
      "content": "Apply the remover. Apply whichever substance you've chosen to remove the bandage. How you will apply it depends on which substance you've chosen. If you are using petroleum jelly, take a pea-sized amount and rub it around and on the bandage with your finger. If you are using an oil, soak a cotton swab and use it to cover the areas all around the bandage, especially the adhesive ends. [2] X Research source If you are using salt water, mix up a teaspoon in a gallon of warm water and soak the entire area. Sometimes simple warm water will do the trick. Giving the baby a bath may be enough to loosen the bandage so that it will come off easily (or even fall off in the tub). [3] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Wait.",
      "content": "Wait. Wait for several minutes while the removal substance soaks into the bandage. Be patient and give it plenty of time to work."

    {
      "title": "Gently peel back the bandage to create a tab.",
      "content": "Gently peel back the bandage to create a tab. Pick the side of the bandage that is most weakly adhered (the side that will be most likely to come off easily). Pull back gently with your index finger. This small raised tab will give you better control when you remove the bandage. If neither side of the bandage comes loose easily, apply some more of whichever substance you've chosen and wait a little longer, then try again. [4] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Tug gently on the lifted area.",
      "content": "Tug gently on the lifted area. The bandage should lift easily from the skin. If it doesn't, add some more of your adhesive remover along the exposed edge of the underside."
    },
    {
      "title": "Pull the bandage slowly off.",
      "content": "Pull the bandage slowly off. Once the bandage is loose, pull it back gradually. It should come off easily at this point. If the bandage is still firmly adhered, you may not have waited long enough. Reapply and wait."

    {
      "title": "Use lotion on the bandaged area.",
      "content": "Use lotion on the bandaged area. If desired, rub cream or lotion over the formerly bandaged area as you remove it. This can make it come off even more easily. This may also feel good for baby, hopefully eliminating any discomfort you may cause."
