Control customization is an important feature in PUBG Mobile, and a good control setting allows you to maneuver your character easily and make your gameplay performance incredible. You may hear some PUBG players talking about “claws” when bringing up the topic of control settings. That refers to the number of fingers(e.g., 2 or 3)used for the control setting, specifically the key buttons (ones for movement, firing, opening scope, etc.). Most newcomers start with a 2-finger claw control setting, though you may want to add more fingers to your setting as you get more advanced at the game. Some pro PUBG players use claw settings that require up to 10 fingers! Try on some different control settings and find one that feels comfortable and performs well in battle. The picture above is an example of a 5-finger (2+3) claw setting (no gyroscope)."

      "content": "Customize your sensitivity setting. A good sensitivity setting is crucial: you rely on it for better aiming and less recoil. There really is no one-size-fits-all sensitivity setting (in other words, a so-called pro player sensitivity setting may not work for you), and the best sensitivity for you will depend on the device you are using, your proficiency with controlling recoil, among other factors. Continue to adjust your sensitivity setting until you are completely satisfied with it. There are 2 main parts of the sensitivity setting: The camera sensitivity (sensitivity when the screen is swiped, while NOT firing) and the ADS sensitivity (sensitivity when the screen is swiped while firing). If you turn on gyroscope, you will be able to control recoil by tilting your device. This is especially useful for phone players, since the smaller screens of their devices makes it difficult to control recoil purely by hand. Gyroscope players have 2 more parts for sensitivity settings—Gyroscope sensitivity and ADS gyroscope sensitivity. (You can choose to control recoil completely or partially by gyroscope. Or, you have the choice to not use gyroscope at all. Choose what’s best for you!) Test out your sensitivity settings in the Training Grounds."

You can choose to play on any of the 6 maps given: Erangel, the classic island map and great for everything; Miramar, a desert map without much cover designed for sniper enthusiasts; Sanhok, a small rain forest map (4km*4km in size) perfect for close-quarters combat; Vikendi, the 6*6 snowy map, great for head-on battles with your enemies; Livik, which is a fairly new map and is smaller than the above 4 (2km*2km, which is only 1/16 the size of Erangel); and Karakin, which is kind of like the Miramar map, but way smaller (2km*2km). Before starting the match, you must select your server and keep in mind that you can't change the server without passing 60 days.

      "content": "Choose your landing spot and jump from the aircraft. PUBG Mobile plots the path of the aircraft across the map, so you can see what you'll be flying over. It also tells you how many people are left on board. Bigger towns attract more players, so if you like intense fights, jump into somewhere called a hot drop. Examples of hot drops include Pochinki and Military Base in the ErangeI map, Los Leones and Pecado in Miramar, Bootcamp and Paradise Resort in Sanhok, Cosmodrome and Villa in Vikendi, and Power Plant and Midtstein in the newest map, Livik. If you prefer to play it safe, skip those places. Or, if you are super serious about raising your tier, jump to the small groups of houses that don’t have names labeled on the map. If you are ranking up, are too nervous to jump to hot drop cities and fight, or simply want good loot without many enemies disturbing you, try this: land at a garage (or on a road) that’s within parachute distance, and drive a car to a high- or medium-drop city that is far away from the flight path. As an example, if the path is from Novo to Stalber (in Erangel), Georgopol or even Zharki would be an excellent choice. This trick works best below Crown tier, and it is best used in Erangel, Miramar, and Vikendi. Here are some useful tips that will make you the first one to land: First, mark your desired location with your marker. Then, follow these directions depending on the distance between you and your landing spot: 1)Always jump when the airplane wings are perpendicular to the flight path, unless the distance between the path and your destination is less than 800m. (If that’s the case, jump when you are exactly 800 meters from it.) 2)If your destination is within the 800 meters parachute distance, look straight down when you jump out and push your joystick to an upper-left angle. 3)If your destination is between 800 and 1200 meters from the path, look forward and push your joystick forward before you reach the 800 meter mark, and when you do reach 800 meters, push your joystick to the upper-left angle and look straight down. 4)If your destination is even further, try opening your chute manually(do this after the first 800 meters when you look forward and push your joystick to the upper-left angle), or you can find a vehicle and drive yourself there. After getting above your landing spot, land faster by looking straight down and pushing your joystick forward until you get to 234 km/h. That way. you'd not be drifting down while others were gathering weapons and preparing to slaughter you. (Your chute opens automatically, so there’s no need to worry about that.) If you're out of the aircraft and you can see masses of people already falling below you, and you can’t guarantee that you’re able to fight all of them, fly to a different area. If you’re on land already, find a vehicle ASAP and drive away. You can pop your chute manually, and you can drift a long way across the map to a different area. Keep in mind, though, that while you're drifting, others are gathering."

      "title": "Get the right weapons to eliminate others.",
      "content": "Get the right weapons to eliminate others. The weapons in PUBG Mobile work similar to weapons in real life. Shotguns (like the S686), pistols (like the P1911), and SMGs (like the UZI and Vector) are only suitable for close-range firing. Light Machine Guns (M249, DP-28, MG3) are great in enclosed spaces when you want to put down a lot of fire quickly. The assault rifles (e.g. AKM, M416) are good all-rounders. Some weapon combinations work better than others. For instance, an assault rifle and an SMG are perfect for close range, and a shotgun plus a bolt-action sniper rifle can work like magic in the hands of a pro. The SCAR-L is a perfect AR for beginner players, as it requires few attachments and is really easy to control. The AKM and M762 are largely favored by pro players, and can perform amazingly if the recoil is controlled well. (The M762 is an especially notable rifle—it performs better than all the ARs in close range, with the exception of airdrop weapons. And the immensely popular M416 is regarded by huge numbers of PUBG players as the “perfect” assault rifle—the only downside is that it requires 5 attachments to reach its full potential—scope, muzzle, grip, magazine, and the tactical stock—and finding all of them can be hard. If you want to truly shine at long range fights, bolt-action sniper rifles are the weapons for you. The Kar98K is a common and powerful bolt-action sniper rifle—if you are aiming accurately by headshot, it can one-shot-kill any enemy with a Lv. 2 helmet or lower. Or, if the enemy is lucky enough to be wearing a Lv. 3 helmet, the Kar98K will penetrate it by 98%. (The newly-added Mosin Nagant is virtually identical to the Kar98K, just with slightly higher damage and range stats.) In the same case, the M24 (think of it as an upgraded version of the 98K) can penetrate a Lv. 3 helmet by 99%. And the almighty airdrop sniper—the AWM, can fully penetrate a Lv. 3 helmet and shoot the enemy straight to death. In the case of a body shot, the AWM could still one-shot any enemy unless the target is wearing a full durability Lv.3 vest. If DMRs (stands for Designated Marksman Rifles, which are basically long-range weapons that can shoot continuously) are more of your thing, definitely check out the Mk14. It’s got the most power and the highest DPS out of all DMRs, and it is also one of only two DMRs that are able to fire at full auto(the other one being the VSS Vintorez, which is not very popular due to its tremendously high bullet drop, low damage and low muzzle velocity). However, the Mk14 is an airdrop-exclusive weapon (that is, you can only find it in the loot drops from the sky), and not everyone wants to take that risk. In that case, the SKS and SLR are common substitutes. The Mini14 is neglected by many players due to its low damage, but its initial bullet speed, at 990m/s, is the fastest out of all DMRs, meaning that, once you get the hang of it, you can probably kill an enemy using the Mini14 before they can kill you. (Note: In Sanhok, the Mini14 is swapped out for the QBU. Similarly, the Mk12 takes its place in Livik. These weapons have virtually identical stats to the Mini14, just with some tweaks to fit the theme of their respective maps.) Of course, all snipers, bolt-action or DMR, can be equipped with an 8x scope, which make long-range aiming way easier. Into shotguns? The S686 is a pro favorite, and it can quickly penetrate through Lv.3 armor and eliminate enemies. But its bullet capacity is only 2–it would be fatal if one happen to miss both shots. The S12K doesn’t have that downside, since it can fire continuously and it has a bullet capacity of 5–way more than that of the S686, and it can be extended to 10 with an extended mag (assault rifle attachments work for the S12K). The DBS is a fairly new shotgun, but it is even better than the previous two. It has a bullet capacity of 14 (which is plenty for a shotgun), and deals massive damage. Keep in mind, though, that shotguns only do their best job at close range (especially when you and an enemy (or enemies) come face to face."

Get the highest level of protection you can find. Also pick up backpacks—they allow you to carry more ammo, throwables, and other things. If you prefer to prone on the ground during end game, ditch the Lv.3 backpack and go for the Lv.2 one. It’s way easier for your enemies to find your location if you have a Lv.3 backpack on. (If you try to swap out your Lv.3 backpack for a Lv.2 but the Lv.3 one is picked up right away, go to Settings (click on the little gear sign, it is still accessible in game), then to pick-up settings, and turn off auto pick-up."

It would be best if you stay out of the blue zone or you'll lose health and eventually die. Drop a marker to a safe area, and you'll see it in your compass to help you navigate to a safe area. You might need to zoom in as the game progresses, especially towards the closing stages, when the zone is small. Avoid the red zone if you are out in the open. The map also shows you the red zone, an artillery barrage. If you're out and about and the red zone arrives in your location, there's a good chance you'll get hit, although if you're in a building, you'll be able to ride it out just fine."

The good news is that you can often recover from damage with some medical attention. Try to always pick up medical supplies when you find them (unless you think that it’s an enemy’s trap). Bandages, first-aid kits, and med kits will replenish your health bar directly. First aid kits will heal your health to 75% and med kits will heal to 100%. Bandages will heal 10HP over 4 seconds. If you find the painkillers, these will give you a gradual health recovery, meaning you can pop them down and get moving."

      "title": "Collect sights.",
      "content": "Collect sights. Many, if not all, weapons in PUBG Mobile can be equipped with sights (or scopes) that make it much easier to aim at the target. There are 7 different scopes in the game: they are the Holographic sight, the Red Dot sight, and the 2x, 3x, 4x,6x, and 8x scopes. If you have scopes that you don’t need(or perhaps ones that you can’t use), share them with your team. For example, if your teammate is a good sniper and you have a spare 8x scope, it would be better for your teammate to have it. You'll automatically add sights to some rifles, but you have the option to equip a particular weapon with a particular accessory. Put the 6x scope on your assault rifle and turn on single fire mode to turn it into a make-shift sniper. ARs that aren’t able to fire full auto (M16A4 and Mk47 Mutant) work especially well in this case. But don’t attempt to use an AKM with a 6x scope (whether full auto or not), unless you are a pro who can handle the extreme recoil! 4x or 6x scopes on close range weapons (specifically SMGs and shotguns) would be useless, so don’t waste your precious scopes on them! The 8x sight will only attach to sniper rifles (both bolt-action snipers, like the M24, and DMRs, like the SKS)."

It is especially good to move underwater when there are enemies on the land and you need to move to another area. No bullets can ever get through water in PUBG Mobile (even the powerful 300 Magnum, used by the AWM), and no throwables can too. However, remember to come out of the water and breathe every once in a while, when enemies aren’t looking at you."
