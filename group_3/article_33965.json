      "content": "Remove the meat from the shell and rinse it. If you have collected the conches yourself, you will need to remove the meat from the shell. If the conch is difficult to remove, drill a small hole in the top of the shell to break the suction and then it should be fairly easy to pull the conch out of the main opening of the shell. Wash the conch in several changes of water."

Before you can cook conches, you must also remove the operculum. The operculum is a shell-like covering that protects the conch and assists in locomotion. Cut off any dark pieces of skin on the conch as well."
