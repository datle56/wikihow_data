The first step in building your sploof will require you to gather the necessary materials. Collect the following items to build your sploof: Find a cardboard tube or PVC tube. A cardboard tube from a toilet paper roll works fine. Dryer sheets will be used to absorb and cover up the smell of the smoke.

      "content": "Use ventilation to your advantage. While it is a good idea to plug up any areas you don't want the smoke to escape from, you may want to send the smoke in another direction. By using ventilation that you think is safe you can keep most of the smoke out of your room and away from anyone else who might smell it. Keep your window open and smoke out of it. Ceiling vents will usually have a fan that will pull the smoke up and out of the room. Make sure your smoke won't accidentally get carried into another room or near another open window."
