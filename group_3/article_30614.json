The cooking surface is the flat top of the oven with the burners on it. [1] X Research source Write the measurements down in a notepad as you go so you don't forget them."

      "content": "Measure from the front of the oven to the back to get the depth. If the oven has handles, knobs, or a control panel on the front of it, exclude them from the total depth. Only measure from the flat front of the oven to the back. [2] X Research source If you’re measuring a wall oven, you may need to unscrew the oven from the wall and slide it out 1–2 inches (2.5–5.1 cm) so you can measure along the side of the oven.

      "content": "Measure the dimensions of the space the new oven will go in. Do this before you go oven shopping so you know what size oven to look for. If you’re installing a new oven in between two countertops or in a wall, measure the height, width, and depth of the space using a tape measure. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Measure the narrowest door along the path to your kitchen. You’ll need to choose an oven that has a width or depth that’s smaller than the width of the narrowest door frame or you won’t be able to get the oven into your kitchen. If you have a particularly narrow door, you may be able to temporarily remove it from the frame so there’s more space to fit the oven through. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Get an oven with 1 ⁄ 4 inch (0.64 cm) smaller dimensions than the space. If you get an oven with the exact same dimensions as the open space you want to put it in, it may not fit. Make sure you don’t get an oven that’s too much smaller than the open space or there will be noticeable gaps on the sides. [7] X Research source"
