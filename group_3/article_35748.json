Select the reason you're refunding the game. Possibly options include things like \"Gameplay or technical issue,” “It’s not what I expected,” or \"I purchased this by accident.\" [5] X Research source Some options may require a little extra explanation. For example, if you select “Gameplay or technical issue,” Steam will prompt you with another list of specific issues you might be having."

You can then complete a few notes explaining the specifics, choose how you’d like your refund to be delivered, and hit the \"submit\" button. [6] X Research source For example, in the notes field, write something like, \"I meant to purchase the newer version of this game, and it wasn't clearly labeled on the site.\" Most Steam refunds can be delivered as a credit in your Steam wallet or directly back to the original payment method you used. Your Steam wallet is where you can redeem gift card codes , but refunds can go there too."

      "content": "Make sure your request adheres to Steam’s refund policy. When possible, ask for a refund within 14 days of your purchase. Also, make sure you haven’t played the game in question for more than 2 hours total. While Steam may issue a refund outside of those timeframes on a case-by-case basis, the company offers a general 14-day and 2-hour window on most returns. [7] X Research source If you want a refund on DLC (rather than the base game), the same 14-day window applies. It’s also best if you haven’t played the game more than 2 hours since installing the DLC. In some cases, DLC can’t be refunded if it changes the base game in a way that is impossible to undo."

However, if you request too many refunds in a short timeframe, you may receive an e-mail with a warning. Some people have been known to mine games for rewards and achievements and then demand a refund, so Steam is suspicious of users who request refunds frequently. [8] X Research source If Valve (Steam’s parent company) does give your account a VAC (Valve Anti-Cheat) ban, you won’t be able to get a refund on your game."

If you bought a game as a gift for someone you added as a friend on Steam and want to refund it, you have 14 days to do so as long as the game hasn’t been redeemed by the recipient. If the recipient has redeemed the game, you can’t get the refund yourself. Instead, the recipient has to request a refund under the same 14-day, 2-hour return period. [9] X Research source If the recipient gets a refund for a game you gave them, the funds will still go back into your account."

[13] X Research source If you don’t see a refund after 10 days, you can always contact Steam Support once more to make sure your banking information is correct."
