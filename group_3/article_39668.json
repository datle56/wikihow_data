      "content": "He’s texting much more often. How often does your husband usually use his phone? If he wasn’t much of a texter before but now he’s always typing away, that’s a sign that he could be chatting with someone new. [1] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "He put a password on his phone.",
      "content": "He put a password on his phone. Many couples let each other use their phones and share passwords. If your husband never had a password before or he changed the password and won’t tell you what it is, he could be hiding something (like a new sexting partner). [2] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "He deletes his texts.",
      "content": "He deletes his texts. When people cheat, they often try to hide the evidence as quickly as they can. If you think your husband is sexting, check his texts—he’ll likely have erased the majority of them to get rid of anything incriminating. [3] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "He tilts his phone away from you while texting.",
      "content": "He tilts his phone away from you while texting. Do you ever see your husband try to casually turn away from you while he texts? Or, he might tilt the phone down so you can’t quite see what’s on the screen. He could be doing this because he’s texting someone that he doesn’t want you to see. [4] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "He sets his phone face-down.",
      "content": "He sets his phone face-down. Watch how your husband puts his phone down whenever he gets up or does something else. Cheaters will often set their phones face-down in case a notification pops up (that way, you won’t be able to see it). [5] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "He keeps his phone on silent all the time.",
      "content": "He keeps his phone on silent all the time. You can’t tell he’s texting if his phone isn’t constantly dinging, right? If your husband used to keep his ringer on but now his phone is only ever on silent, that’s a red flag. [6] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "He sleeps with his phone nearby.",
      "content": "He sleeps with his phone nearby. Some cheaters will even go so far as to sleep with their phone underneath their pillow. This is likely because he doesn’t want to leave his phone unguarded while he sleeps, just in case you go through it. [7] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "He takes his phone everywhere.",
      "content": "He takes his phone everywhere. Maybe he used to set his phone down to go to the bathroom, but now he keeps it with him. Or, maybe he used to leave his phone at home when he went to the gym, but now it stays in his pocket. This could indicate that he’s sexting someone else (or at least has info on there he doesn’t want you to see). [8] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "He leaves the room to text.",
      "content": "He leaves the room to text. He might not want you to see him smiling, blushing, or even taking pics to send back and forth. If your husband is constantly getting up to send a text to someone, it’s a sign he’s doing something shady he doesn’t want you to see."

    {
      "title": "He gets defensive when you ask him about his phone.",
      "content": "He gets defensive when you ask him about his phone. Maybe you bring up your concerns and he immediately accuses you of being nosy. Or, he might even accuse you of cheating (it’s a common defense tactic that cheaters use). If your husband immediately jumps into defense mode instead of calmly reacting, that’s a red flag. [9] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "He doesn’t respond to your texts as quickly.",
      "content": "He doesn’t respond to your texts as quickly. You know your husband is always on his phone, so why isn’t he getting back to you? This could be a sign that he’s devoting all his texting energy to a new partner or that he’s intentionally ignoring you so he has more time to sext. [10] X Research source"

Or, he might spend more time holed up alone, with his laptop or phone in tow, of course. When his routine changes, it could be a sign that he’s carving out time to sext someone new.

      "title": "He likes the attention.",
      "content": "He likes the attention. Sexting another woman can be exciting and likely makes your husband feel good.

      "content": "He’s subconsciously sabotaging the relationship. Sometimes, we don’t feel “good enough” to have a relationship with our partners, and we sabotage the partnership to avoid feeling heartbreak later on.

Even if you’re not 100% sure or you think you might just be imagining things, bring it up. Otherwise, it’s going to fester inside of you until you explode. “Hey, could we talk? I’ve noticed you’ve been on your phone a lot more recently, and it’s got me overthinking a little bit.” “Let’s have a chat. Could we talk about your behavior lately? I’m not sure I’m okay with how often you’re texting another woman.” “I know you’ve been sexting someone else behind my back, and it’s not okay.” Reader Poll: We asked 709 wikiHow readers, and 54% of them agreed that they’d feel suspicious and confront their partner if they suddenly started hiding their phone from them.

I felt like you had violated my trust.” “When you get over-protective and defensive about your phone, I feel like you don’t trust me.” “I see sexting as cheating, so I feel like you’ve cheated on me for the past month.”"

If it’s something understandable, now’s the time you can decide whether or not you can forgive him. [18] X Research source For instance, maybe he was doing it for the attention or because he’s insecure. If that’s the case, you two could potentially work on your relationship and repair things. However, if he’s been sexting other women because he’s not happy and wants to end the relationship, then you may need to reconsider."

If you confront your husband and ask him to change, but he doesn’t, consider starting the divorce process soon. It can be really tough to decide whether or not to divorce your spouse, especially if you have children together.

      "content": "Yes, most people consider sexting to be cheating. While it can be confusing because there’s nothing physical going on, many people agree that sexting someone outside of the relationship constitutes cheating behavior. It’s because your husband is forming a relationship with another woman—it might not be romantic, but it’s certainly sexual.
