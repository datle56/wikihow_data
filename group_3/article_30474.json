Don’t worry about shaving any body hair; it doesn’t bother your massage therapist. 2. Cover any open cuts or warts with bandages . Let your massage therapist know where they are so they avoid touching those areas. 3. Avoid heavy meals 2 hours before your massage . Stick to a light snack if you're hungry and make sure to stay hydrated. 4. Avoid drinking alcohol before your massage . Alcohol can lessen the relaxing effects of your massage. [1] X Research source 5. Don’t put on makeup, fragrance, or fake tanner beforehand . They could leave marks or stains on the massage table’s sheets. Additionally, avoid wearing perfume or cologne. 6. Arrive 15 minutes before your scheduled time so you have time to fill out paperwork and get in a relaxed mindset. 7. Put your phone on silent . Setting your phone to silent gets rid of distractions so your massage feels more relaxing. 8. Take off any jewelry you’re wearing. Jewelry could get in your massage therapist’s way and end up covered in massage oil. [2] X Research source 9. Inform your massage therapist about sensitive spots . If you’re ticklish or have any areas that have been causing a lot of pain, tell your massage therapist before they start. They’ll take extra care around those spots or avoid them completely. 10. Don’t feel pressured to fill the silence . If you want to quietly enjoy your massage, it’s okay if you don’t chit-chat. Your massage therapist will follow your lead and let you relax. They may check in to see how you're doing and if you want more or less pressure. 11. Speak up during your session if you feel pain . Different areas of the body can handle different pressures. Speak up if you'd like to ask for more or less pressure—it's not rude at all. Your massage therapist will be happy to do what it takes to make you comfortable. 12. Pass gas if you need to . Passing gas or burping is completely normal as your muscles relax during a massage, so it won’t bother your massage therapist when it happens. [3] X Research source 13. Doze off if you’re feeling tired . It’s completely normal to drift off to sleep when you’re so relaxed from a massage, so your massage therapist won’t judge if you start snoring in the middle of your session. 14. Don’t worry if you get an erection . Getting an erection is a normal response to physical touch and relaxation, so it’s common for it to happen during a massage. Your massage therapist will ignore it as long as you’re behaving appropriately.

Treat your massage therapist as a professional . You may have heard of receiving “extras” or “happy endings,” but these advances are not tolerated by massage therapists and may end your session immediately. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Undress down to your comfort level. You should feel relaxed when you get your massage, so wear whatever makes you most comfortable. Most people dress down to their underwear or even get completely naked. If you don't want to take off your underwear, it’s okay to leave them on and stay covered up. You’ll never have to do anything that makes you feel uncomfortable. [6] X Research source Your massage therapist will also drape a sheet over you and cover any parts they’re not currently working on so you have some privacy. What should you wear to a massage? Opt for loose, comfortable clothes, like sweatpants, athletic shorts, or baggy T-shirts so it's easy to undress and redress for your massage."

      "content": "Give your massage therapist a 15–20% tip. If you’re satisfied with your massage, 15% is a good starting point for your tip. Even if you’re unhappy with the massage, it’s still good etiquette to tip around 15%. If your massage was great, tip closer to 20%. Don’t be afraid to tip your massage therapist even more if you’re feeling really generous. [7] X Research source Some spas have no-tipping policies, so don’t be afraid to ask about it when you arrive for your massage. You’re also not expected to tip for medical massages at a clinic.

      "content": "When you set an appointment , you’ll choose which type of massage from the facility’s menu. If it’s your first time, you may need to fill out paperwork at the spa or massage facility when you arrive. During your massage , the massage therapist will ask you about sore areas or trouble spots to target during the session. They’ll leave the room so you can undress and knock before coming back in to start. After your massage , your massage therapist will leave again so you can get dressed and then go over anything they found during the session. When you’re all finished, you’ll pay for the massage."
