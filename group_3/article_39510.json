      "content": "Eat a healthy diet rich in vegetables to help your body heal. Load up on organic fruits and vegetables. Dark leafy greens (such as spinach and kale), cruciferous vegetables (such as broccoli and Brussels sprouts), legumes (such as beans, peas, and lentils), and nuts and seeds (such as almonds, chia seeds, and flax seeds) are all healthy choices. Make sure to also incorporate sources of healthy fat, such as oily fish (like tuna and mackerel).

A plant-based diet, in particular, may help regulate the production of hormones that affect reproductive health.

      "content": "Incorporate potassium-rich foods into your diet. Some proponents of natural medicine believe that ovarian cysts can be a result of potassium deficiency and that eating more potassium may help heal and prevent cysts. [3] X Research source Good sources of dietary potassium include sweet potatoes, beet greens, yogurt, tomatoes, bananas, and many types of seafood (such as clams, tuna, and halibut). Most people can benefit from incorporating more potassium into their diet, but consuming too much potassium can also negatively affect your health. [4] X Research source Talk to your doctor about whether you are getting a healthy amount of potassium from your diet. The average adult should get around 4,700 mg of potassium from their diet each day.

      "content": "Drink a small amount of apple cider vinegar daily. Mix 1 tablespoon (15 mL) of apple cider vinegar with 7 fluid ounces (210 mL) of water and drink it each day after a meal. There are no evidence-based studies that show apple cider vinegar has an effect on ovarian cyst size. However, one small study showed that consuming a small amount of ACV each day may relieve some symptoms of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). [6] X Research source Apple cider vinegar may provide some health benefits, such as helping to regulate blood sugar and facilitating weight loss. Like any dietary supplement, however, it can be harmful if you take too much of it. Too much ACV can damage your teeth, and it may also overwork your kidneys, especially if you have chronic kidney disease. [7] X Research source Limit your intake of ACV to no more than 1 tablespoon (15 mL) to 2 tablespoons (30 mL) unless a doctor or dietitian advises you otherwise. Rinse your mouth with water after drinking ACV to minimize damage to your teeth. [8] X Research source"

Some alternative medicine specialists believe that systemic enzyme supplements may help reduce inflammation and promote the breakdown of excess or abnormal tissues, like those found in some types of ovarian cysts. [9] X Research source There has been little scientific research on the effectiveness of oral systemic enzyme supplements for treating any type of medical condition. Systemic enzyme therapy is likely safe, but there is no strong evidence that it is actually helpful for shrinking ovarian cysts. [10] X Research source"

If you wish, you can gently warm the pack by placing a sheet of plastic over the cloth and placing a microwaveable heating pad on top of the plastic. [11] X Research source Some natural medicine proponents claim that castor oil applied to the skin may promote better blood circulation and healing of the organs in the area where the oil is applied, including the ovaries. [12] X Research source Once you’re done using the pack, you can clean the castor oil off your skin with a mixture of water and baking soda. [13] X Research source Do not use castor oil while you are pregnant or nursing, since it may not be safe for the fetus or baby. Some natural healthcare practitioners also caution against using castor oil packs during your period, since it is believed to increase blood flow. [14] X Research source There is no scientific evidence to support castor oil as a remedy for ovarian cysts. However, even if the castor oil pack does not help shrink your cysts, it may still provide some comfort if you are experiencing pain. [15] X Research source"

The etiology, or cause, of the symptoms is especially important since this can indicate whether or not you have a medical condition that requires urgent medical care or a benign cyst. Go to the emergency room if you have serious symptoms such as severe abdominal or pelvic pain that comes on suddenly, or pain accompanied by fever, nausea, or vomiting.
