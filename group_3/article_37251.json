If this technique doesn't work for you, try using our other method that involves disconnecting the vehicle's battery to reset the sensor."

If you’re lucky, the steering wheel sensor should be fully reset now. Turn your steering wheel with the engine running to ensure you don’t get any dash warnings. Test drive the vehicle by driving it around the block a few times. If all is good, your sensor is reset. If this doesn’t work, try repeating the process with the engine running. On some vehicles, the engine has to be on. [3] X Research source"

While you’re waiting, turn the steering wheel all the way to the left, wait 3-5 seconds, then do the same on the right. Turning the wheel may help the steering angle sensor recalibrate, but don’t worry about it if the wheel won’t turn."

Then, reconnect the positive terminal followed by the negative terminal. Turn the key in the ignition to start the vehicle. Turn the wheel all the way to the left then all the way to the right 3 times. Do not leave the park position while doing this."

If this doesn’t work, you cannot reset your steering angle sensor without an OBD-2 sensor. Reach out to a friend or family member to borrow an OBD-2 sensor . Plug it in and reset the error codes to reset the sensor. If the error comes back after resetting the engine with the OBD-2, you probably need a new clock spring in your steering wheel. Steering angle sensors basically never break, but the spring holding them in place can come loose. [5] X Research source"

The steering angle sensor is a small dial inside of your steering wheel (usually under the horn) that tracks the angle of the steering wheel. Your vehicle checks the steering wheel location against the angle of the tires to confirm your alignment is good. [6] X Research source If the steering angle sensor isn’t working, the “ESC” light will pop on your vehicle. On some vehicles, the indicator will look like the back of a car with some swerve lines on the back tires."
