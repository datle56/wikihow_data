      "content": "Connect the printer to your wireless network. The process for this will vary depending on the printer. You'll need to know your Wi-Fi network name ( SSID ) and password. [2] X Research source Many printers will allow you to connect to the wireless network using the built-in menu system. Refer to the printer's documentation for the exact location. If you can't find your manual, you can almost always download a PDF copy from the manufacturer's support site. If your printer and router both support WPS push-to-connect, simply push the WPS button on your printer, then press the WPS button on your router within two minutes. The connection will be made automatically. Some older wireless printers may require you to connect to a computer first to set up the wireless connection. This is common if the printer doesn't have a built-in menu, but does support wireless. Connect the printer to your computer via USB, and use the included software to set up the printer's wireless connection. After configuring its wireless, you can disconnect it from your computer and place it where you want."
