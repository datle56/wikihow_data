According to Sanders, “Shar[ing] common interests, values, and life goals” as well as “a lot of the same beliefs about life in general, such as religious beliefs” is a sign you and your partner are compatible together.

Asking questions—both silly, sexy, and serious—can improve your relationship by: [7] X Research source Building trust between you and your partner. Teaching you both more about one another. Enhancing your communication skills. Allowing you to discover things you have in common. Helping you establish a safe space where you can be yourselves. Fostering personal reflection and growth.

You and your partner can agree to ask each other questions during your next date over a bottle of wine—it can be a fun way to enjoy each other’s company.

Making asking questions a weekly or monthly habit can help strengthen your relationship and make sure you’re pretty much always in sync with one another—especially if you build asking questions into a fun and romantic date night! Then again, for some couples, scheduling a Q-and-A session may add unwanted pressure—it could be more helpful to ask questions spontaneously!"
