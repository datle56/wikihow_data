      "content": "Hanging around your crush at every possible moment can make you appear needy and clingy. This can come across as creepy, especially if you’ve just met. Instead, say hello to your crush when you cross paths or make definitive plans to spend time together. Don’t make your crush think that you are too much into them if you haven’t kissed or haven’t even had your first date yet. Likewise, avoid overwhelming them with huge text messages. For instance, if they send you two words, don’t respond with seven sentences."
