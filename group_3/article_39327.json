You'll need the Shazam app on your Android, iPhone, or iPad to use Auto Shazam, a feature that instantly identifies any music that's playing around you. You can get the app from App Store or Play Store . If you have an iPhone or iPad, you don't really need to use this method—you can just use Control Center to identify the music in a video instead of downloading the app. But if you want features like the ability to connect Shazam with Spotify or Apple Music, you can download the Shazam app. Auto Shazam is especially handy if you want to automatically identify many songs from different videos without having to toggle back and forth between apps."
