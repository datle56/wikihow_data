[3] X Research source If your deck only has mild dirt or debris, or you cannot find a power washer, hand wash the deck with a mild cleaner like dish soap, water, and a wire scrub brush. Apply the cleaner and gently scrub the deck with the wet scrub brush, removing dirt and debris. Rub the deck in long, horizontal strokes to work the cleaner into the wood and then rinse off any remaining soap with water."
