Only one user can play a game in a shared library at a time. If your friend is playing a game in their library, you won't be able to play a different one until they stop, and vice versa. You can avoid this by switching to the Steam Families beta . You can only share a library with up to 5 accounts and up to 10 devices in a 90-day period. If a borrower cheats or commits fraud while playing a shared game, you may lose your Family Sharing privileges, and you may also be VAC banned."

When adding a new member, you can select if they are an adult or a child. Child members have extra parental controls applied, while adult members do not have these restrictions. Child members cannot leave a Steam Family, but adult members can. However, if someone leaves a Steam Family, there is a 1-year cooldown to invite someone else to take that spot, but the previous family member can rejoin with no cooldowns."
