      "content": "In a game of Congkak, players compete to have the most pieces into the large holes on the ends of the board, known as “storehouses”. During a turn, a player picks up all the pieces in one of the smaller holes (“houses”) and distributes them one at a time around the board. Depending on where a player drops the last piece on their turn, they may be able to take another turn or capture pieces from their opponent. [1] X Research source"

A congkak board has 2 rows of 7 smaller holes called the “houses” and 2 larger holes on the ends called “storehouses.” Each player sits in front of one row of houses so their storehouse is on their left. Fill each of the houses with 7 pieces, like marbles, shells, seeds, or any other small objects you have on hand. [2] X Research source Leave the storehouses empty. [3] X Research source"

Go clockwise around the board dropping 1 piece at a time into each house. Be sure to drop a piece into your storehouse each time you pass it, but skip over your opponent’s. In some variations, both players choose one of their houses and distribute pieces at the same time before alternating turns. [4] X Research source"

If you put your last piece into any house that already has pieces in it, pick them all up and keep distributing them clockwise around the board. If you place the last piece in your storehouse, choose any other house on your side of the board and take another turn. [5] X Research source Strategy Tip : Pick houses on your turn that will let you make multiple moves. Count how many pieces are in a house before choosing it to figure out where the last piece will end up."

Start at the left-most house, and place 7 pieces into each of your houses.If you’re able to fill all your houses with pieces, put any extras back into your storehouse.If you don’t have enough pieces, any empty houses on your side of the board are considered “burnt.” If a player accidentally drops a piece into a burnt house, the piece goes straight into their opponent’s storehouse.Whoever had fewer pieces starts the next round, following the same rules as before. The game ends once a player loses all their pieces or once all their houses are burnt."
