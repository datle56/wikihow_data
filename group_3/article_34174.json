      "content": "Wash your hair daily. People with oily hair may need to wash more often. While you may have heard that washing less will decrease oil production, that’s actually not true—you can’t really “train” your scalp to produce less oil. Instead, experts recommend washing every other day or every day to remove grease and oil from your hair. [1] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Dermatology Professional organization made of over 20,000 certified dermatologists Go to source Everyone’s body is different: some people need to wash as little as once a week, while other people have to wash every day. Do what’s best for your hair and your routine."

      "content": "Use shampoo for oily hair. Shampoo for oily hair cleanses your scalp to get rid of grease. Some shampoos are hydrating and moisturizing, which is great for dry hair, but not so good for oily hair. Pick out a shampoo that’s formulated for your hair type for best results. [2] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Dermatology Professional organization made of over 20,000 certified dermatologists Go to source If you tend to use a lot of hair products, try using a clarifying shampoo as often as once a week. This will help remove buildup from your hair so it doesn’t look weighed down or greasy."

      "content": "Apply fewer hair products. Product buildup could be making your hair greasy. If you have oily or fine hair, adding too many products (like gel, hairspray, texture spray, and more) might be adding extra grease to your scalp. Try to cut down on the products in your routine as much as you can. [3] X Research source For instance, if you use a gel and a curl cream, see how your hair does with just a gel. If you use hairspray and a texturizing spray, try to pick one instead of using both."

      "title": "Use oil-free hair products.",
      "content": "Use oil-free hair products. Apply non-greasy products to your hair to avoid weighing it down. If you use any kind of styling products, look for ones that say “greaseless” or “oil-free” on the packaging. That way, you’ll avoid adding more oil to your hair, which will keep your hair looking clean for much longer. [4] X Research source If you use hair oils , stick to using them on the mid-lengths and ends of your hair. That way, they won’t make your roots greasier."

      "title": "Sleep with your hair in a bun.",
      "content": "Sleep with your hair in a bun. Sleeping with your hair up prevents grease from getting onto your ends. Looking for an overnight hairstyle to prevent greasy hair? A high bun (also called a pineapple) is a great choice. Flip your head over and pull your hair to the front of your scalp. Then, wrap a scrunchie around your hair one time, twist it over itself, and pull your hair through the scrunchie again, but only halfway. This will create a messy bun on top of your head to keep your locks contained while you sleep. [5] X Research source Use a scrunchie, not a hair tie, to pineapple your hair. Scrunchies are delicate, and they won’t cause friction or breakage. If you have curly hair, cover your hair in a silk scarf or bonnet to make your curls last until the next morning."

      "content": "Wash your pillowcase weekly. A dirty pillowcase might add oil to your hair overnight. Try to remember when the last time you washed your pillowcase was. If you’re having trouble, your hair might be getting greasy because of your pillowcase. Make it a habit to throw your pillowcase into the wash at least once a week. [6] X Research source If you have curly or wavy hair, consider switching over to a silk pillowcase . These pillowcases create less frizz overnight, because the material won’t catch on your hair and pull it while you sleep."

      "content": "Use dry shampoo before bed. Dry shampoo soaks up grease and oil overnight. If you’re heading to bed and you notice that your roots are looking a little oily, grab a can of dry shampoo and use dry shampoo on your roots. Instead of massaging the product into your hair like you normally would, just head to bed so the dry shampoo will soak up oil overnight. [7] X Research source Don’t have dry shampoo? Try baby powder instead. This is a great option if you have darker hair, because the dry shampoo will absorb oil overnight without leaving a powdery residue on your hair.

      "title": "Brush your hair once a day.",
      "content": "Brush your hair once a day. Brushing your hair moves oil from your scalp down to your ends. While brushing your hair won’t necessarily make your scalp produce more oil, it can affect how oily your hair looks. [9] X Research source Try to only brush your hair once a day so the natural oils stay at your roots instead of weighing down the rest of your hair. Don’t forget to clean your hair brush often! If your hair brush is full of old hair and grease, it could be making your hair look oily. Try to limit how often you touch your hair, too. Our fingers deposit oil and grime, which can contribute to the greasy, weighed-down look."

      "title": "Condition your mid-lengths and ends, not your scalp.",
      "content": "Condition your mid-lengths and ends, not your scalp. Using conditioner on your roots makes your hair greasy. Conditioner is great for hydrating your hair and tamping down frizz. After you wash your hair, apply conditioner to just the mid-lengths and ends of your hair. Then, rinse it out completely to avoid weighing down your locks. [10] X Research source A great trick for applying conditioner is to grab your hair like you’re putting it in a ponytail. Any hair that would be in the ponytail gets conditioned, and any hair that’s not in the ponytail does not. If your hair is naturally oily, try using a detangling spray out of the shower instead of conditioner in the shower."
