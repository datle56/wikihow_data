      "content": "The 🤨 emoji means doubt and skepticism. You’ll often see this emoji in texts where the other person is basically saying, “Really?” or “I don’t know about that.” The context can vary; the emoji implies sarcasm if you’ve been joking around but conveys genuine doubt if the conversation is serious. [1] X Research source Person 1: “It’s time for me to run away and become a forest hermit. I can’t with this project!” Person 2: “Hmm. Well, if you’re sure. 🤨 Good luck, bud!” Person 1: “Gonna play a crazy joke on dad this April Fool’s day!” Person 2: “You sure he’ll get the joke? 🤨 I remember what happened last time…”"

      "content": "The 🤨 emoji also represents disapproval. If someone wants to say, “That’s a bad idea,” or “I don’t agree with you,” they might send the 🤨 emoji in place of writing the words directly. It communicates both disagreement and concern for someone’s troubling line of thinking. [2] X Research source Person 1: “No sleep for me tonight! Going to pull an all-nighter and work.” Person 2: “That doesn’t seem like a super healthy idea. 🤨 Do you need some help?”"

When you’re pretty sure that the person texting you is fibbing, and you want them to know they can’t fool you, include the 🤨 emoji in your text.

Include a 🤨 in your text if you want someone to know you disagree—whether their idea seems unsafe or they’re saying something that seems inappropriate. It can be helpful if you’re trying not to come on too strong and say, “That’s a terrible thought,” right out of the gate. [6] X Research source “IDK if you should be biking before you get a helmet. 🤨 Can I give you a ride?” “That seems kinda harsh 🤨 Did your parents do something to upset you?”"
