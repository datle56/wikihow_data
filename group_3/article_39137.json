To sew a double-fold hem (also called a turned hem ), lay out your clothing or fabric on a countertop, inside out or pattern-side down, with the hem/edge in front of you. Fold the fabric edge up ⅝-inch (15 mm), and use an iron to flatten it out and sharpen the fold. Starting from the folded edge, create a second ⅝-inch (15 mm) fold over the first, so the raw edge of the first fold is hidden under the second. [1] X Research source Mark your measurements with a fabric chalk or marker for sewing . The marks are easy for you to see while working, but come right out in the wash. If you're hemming a pair of pants that are tapered, be sure to account for that—you'll need to taper the inside piece outward so the pants don't pucker, advises professional tailor David Pew.

Stitch along the folded edge until you’ve sewn the whole hem. Then tie off and cut your thread. [4] X Research source Pew adds that it’s important to keep the stitches loose on the hem. If they're tight, they'll make the bottom of the pants look puckered. [5] X Expert Source David Pew Professional Tailor Expert Interview. 5 January 2021. When hand-sewing, use a back stitch or other strong straight stitch to secure the hem. When using a sewing machine, you can also use a twin needle to sew 2 parallel seams to make a more secure hem."

When you’re done ironing, turn your fabric right-side-out, and give yourself a pat on the back for sewing your own hem!

Determine your seam allowance or the width of the fold you make. Fold the fabric up from the edge, and then fold it again to hide the raw edge. Use an iron to flatten your folds. [8] X Research source “Double check with a ruler or measuring tape and the end to ensure it is even,” recommends Kofi-Bruce. [9] X Expert Source Kpoene Kofi-Bruce Couture Bridal Designer Expert Interview. 28 January 2021. Insert the pins so that the blunt/pearl end is on the fabric portion, while the needle/tip is sticking out towards the edge of the hem to hold the fabric in place. When using a sewing machine, fold your ironed section under the fabric. Take the portion of fabric that you just folded/ironed, and fold it in the opposite direction so that it’s hidden under the fabric with about ⅛ inch (3 mm) exposed. Your fabric is now pattern-side down, with a ⅛-inch (3 mm) exposed fold at the edge."

If you're sewing by hand , use a blind stitch , and just catch one thread from the outside fabric each time you make a stitch, suggests Pew. [10] X Expert Source David Pew Professional Tailor Expert Interview. 5 January 2021. Make stitches about ¼ inch (5mm) apart along the fold. Continue sewing until you reach the end of your hem. To sew a blind hem on a sewing machine, your machine needs a blind hem stitch setting (^----^----^) and a blind hem foot . [11] X Research source Start by turning your fabric sideways on the sewing machine, so that the ⅛-inch fold is on the right side, and the rest of the fabric is on the left. Sew along the edge where the fold and fabric meet, keeping the edge of the fabric plumb to the divider on your presser foot, to the end of your fabric. You can also make an invisible hem with iron-on hemming tape . Master tailor Mia Danilowicz says, “That's technically not the proper way of doing it.” She adds that you can use double-sided tape if you’re in a rush.

If you used a sewing machine, unfold your hem and look for the ‘--^----^--’ pattern on the back of the fabric.

[14] X Research source However, the lack of a second fold means you must take a step to prevent the raw edge from fraying. Single-fold hems are usually narrower than double-fold hems, but you can make them any width you like. The most common ways to prevent fraying are to use a sewing machine to zigzag the edge (called a zigzag hem ) or use a serger to neaten the edge (sometimes called a serged hem or overlocked hem )."

Or make your seam along the neatened edge of the fabric. [16] X Research source Another way to prevent fraying on single-fold hems is to use bias tape for sewing . This is called a faced hem (or a bound hem when the binding completely covers the hem). When using bias binding tape , line it up with the raw edge of the fabric and sew a seam through the edge of the tape along the fabric’s edge. Then, sew the hem by making a seam along the unstitched edge of the bias tape."

This step is especially important if you’re working with sheer fabric to make the hem as invisible as possible. [20] X Research source If you’d like to make your rolled seam extra-strong, roll the hemline just enough to hide the raw edge and then press the entire hem flat. Sew through the middle of the rolled him all along your hemline."
