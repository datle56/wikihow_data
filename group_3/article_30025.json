      "title": "Draw an outline of the gun onto paper, then cut it out.",
      "content": "Draw an outline of the gun onto paper, then cut it out. Get a piece of paper out and grab a ruler and a pencil. Draw a gun barrel that’s about 6 inches (15 cm) long, then add a grip, or a handle, that’s 5 to 6 in (13 to 15 cm) long near the back of the barrel. When you’re finished, use scissors to cut out the gun shape. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Trace the shape onto cardboard and cut out 2 pieces. Get a stiff, flat piece of cardboard and trace your gun shape onto it in 2 separate places. Then, use scissors to cut out the pieces, which will become the front and back of your gun. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Glue the pieces together with a strip of cardboard at the top.",
      "content": "Glue the pieces together with a strip of cardboard at the top. Cut out a long, rectangular piece of cardboard that’s about 3 in (7.6 cm) thick. Attach it to 1 piece of your cardboard gun at the very top with a hot glue gun . Then, add the second gun shape to the other side of the cardboard strip, and cut any excess off the back. [3] X Research source This cardboard strip is the top of the barrel of the gun. When you’re done gluing this part, your gun will look 3D."

    {
      "title": "Add cardboard to the handle of the gun.",
      "content": "Add cardboard to the handle of the gun. Now it’s time to fill in the missing pieces of your pistol. Cut out 3 small strips of cardboard that are about 3 inches (7.6 cm) long and 2 in (5.1 cm) wide. Paste 2 of them on either side of the grip, then add 1 to the very top of the barrel. If there is any excess cardboard hanging off the gun, cut it off with scissors. [4] X Research source When you’re done, you’ll be holding an almost complete 3D gun."

      "title": "Roll up 2 thin sheets of paper.",
      "content": "Roll up 2 thin sheets of paper. Cut a normal-sized sheet of paper in half. With one of the halves, roll it tightly around a straw, then secure the middle with tape and pull it off the straw so it’s hollow in the middle. With the other half, roll it up tightly with nothing inside so it isn’t hollow, then secure the middle with tape. [5] X Research source These small rolled up paper strips will become part of the barrel of your gun, and they’ll shoot out the “bullets.”"

Bend 1 end down about 1 ⁄ 2 in (1.3 cm), then slide a rubber band onto the hook you just made. Tape the paper hook down to secure the rubber band. [6] X Research source"

Grab the other sheet of paper that you rolled up and slide it through the back of the hollow piece of paper, keeping the rubber band pointed at the back of the gun.

      "content": "Poke a skewer through the front and out the back of the gun. Use scissors to cut a small hole in the back of your gun on the very back of the barrel. Then, poke a skewer through the front of the gun, where the trigger would be. Stick the back end of the skewer out of the hole you cut into the barrel. [9] X Research source The front part of the skewer is going to act like your trigger. If the tip of the skewer is too hard to reach with your finger while holding the grip of your gun, cut the skewer down."

      "content": "Sharpen crayons to use as bullets. Grab a handful of crayons and break them in half so they’re small. Use a pencil sharpener to make them sharp and “bullet-like.” [10] X Research source You can also use skinny pieces of chalk."

      "content": "Load your gun with bullets and pull back the paper to cock your gun. Grab the non-hollow piece of paper and pull it back toward the back of the barrel. Use the hooked end of the piece of paper to cock it backwards, then hook the end over the back of the barrel. Then, slide a crayon into the hollow sheet of paper at the front of the gun. When you press the “trigger,” or the wooden skewer, the crayon will shoot out like a bullet! [11] X Research source Be careful with your new toy gun, and don’t shoot it at anyone. Even though it’s not a real gun, shooting crayons at someone can still hurt."

      "content": "Draw a shotgun shape onto a small piece of wood. Look for a piece of scrap wood that’s about 1 in (2.5 cm) thick and 4 to 5 in (10 to 13 cm) long. Use a pencil to trace a shotgun shape onto the side of the wood for the base of your gun. [12] X Research source Making a gun out of wood requires some wood carving skills. If you aren’t comfortable carving a block of wood, stick to the cardboard gun method above."

      "content": "Carve the body of the shotgun with a knife. Use a knife to whittle the shotgun shape out of wood. Gently slide the knife forward and cut away from your hands to avoid slicing into your fingers. Follow the curves of the gun, and keep the center about 1 in (2.5 cm) thick. [13] X Research source Use caution with whittling, as it can be dangerous. If you’re a kid, ask your parent’s permission before using a knife. After you’re done whittling, you can use a piece of sandpaper to smooth down any rough edges."

Then, flip the gun over and add a small notch on the bottom of the gun in the center of the barrel (halfway between the front and back). [14] X Research source"

Then, point the bottom part of the spring downward toward the floor and push the spring over your gun. Settle the spring into the 2 notches that you just made. [15] X Research source The end result will be a miniature shotgun with a spring on the bottom. The majority of the spring will be facing downward off the bottom of the gun."

Use hot glue to glue down 2 small metal tubes to the front of your gun to create a double barrel. Have them hang off the front of the gun a little bit so they can shoot. [16] X Research source Most people use 2 pieces of a telescope magnet for this step."

      "content": "Load 2 matches into the shotgun as bullets. Slide a match into both of the metal tubes from the front, and make sure they stick slightly out of the back of the tubes. Then, pull back the spring on the top of the gun to cock it. When you’re ready, pull the trigger on the bottom of the gun to propel the spring forward and shoot the matches out. [17] X Research source Be careful where you point your gun, and never shoot anyone else with it. Even though they’re just matches, shooting someone with them could hurt them."
