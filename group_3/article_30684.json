The complete chain, including the clasp, should be measured because that is what determines how long it hangs.

      "content": "Note the length. You can make a mental note or write it down. This length is the marketable size of the necklace. If you lived in the United States, measurements are typically in inches, and centimeters are used in most other parts of the world. You can, however, take the measurement in both units if you wish. [3] X Research source Round up to the next inch or centimeter if you get a measurement that isn’t a precise number. If this is a length you want for a new necklace, you can bring in this length while searching for a necklace"

      "title": "Measure your neck size.",
      "content": "Measure your neck size. Neck size is probably the most important measurement for determining which necklace length will work best for you. To measure, wrap a soft tape measure around your neck, keeping the tape measure parallel to the floor as you measure. Then, add 2 to 4 inches (5 to 10 cm) to your neck measurement to calculate your minimum recommended chain length. [4] X Research source If you are a person with a neck size measuring 13 (33 cm) to 14 ½ inches (36.8 cm), an 18-inch (45.7 cm) necklace is a good choice for necklace length. If you have a neck size measuring 15 (38 cm) to 16 ½ inches (41.2 cm), a 20-inch (50.8 cm) necklace would be a good choice. If your neck size measures 17 (43.2 cm) to 18 ½ inches (47 cm), a 22-inch (55.9 cm) necklace would be a good option for you."

      "content": "Choose a standard length if the chain can’t be customized. If you cannot customize the necklace length to your neck size, simply choose the second size up from your neck size as your minimum necklace measurement. For instance, if you are a person with a neck size measuring 17 inches (43 cm), your minimum standard should be 20 inches (50 cm) instead of 18 inches (45 cm)."

      "content": "Take your height into consideration when choosing a length. In addition to neck size, your height can also change the position of a necklace around your neck. Long necklaces can overwhelm shorter people, and short necklaces can get lost on taller people. If your height is below 5 feet (1.5 m) 4 inches (162 cm), stick with necklaces measuring between 16 and 20 inches (40 and 50 cm). For people with heights between 5 feet (1.5 m) 4 inches (162 cm) and 5 feet (1.5 m) 7 inches (170 cm), necklaces of any length should work well. People with a height of 5 feet (1.5 m) 7 inches (170 cm) or taller look best in longer necklaces."

      "title": "Choose a size to flatter your body type.",
      "content": "Choose a size to flatter your body type. Just as different clothes flatter different parts of the body, different necklace lengths accentuate different parts of the body. If you have a slighter body type, a short, thin chain is a great choice. For a fuller figure, a slightly longer and thicker chain is flattering. If you want to accent the bust, choose a necklace that draws attention to the area just below the collarbone and above the bust. Usually, 20 to 22 inch (50 to 55 cm) necklaces will do the trick. If you have a flatter, less prominent bust, thin chains measuring around 22 inches (55 cm) tend to have an elegant look."

      "title": "Balance a length to your face shape.",
      "content": "Balance a length to your face shape. Necklaces can subtly make your face appear wider, narrower, longer, or shorter depending on the natural shape of your face. As such, different necklace measurements can flatter certain face shapes better than others. Some styles that work well on different face shapes are: A choker length necklace measuring between 10 and 16 inches (25 and 40 cm) can help soften the sharp angle of the chin on people with heart-shaped faces. This tactic also works well for those who have rectangular and oblong faces. People with round faces should avoid short necklaces since these chains tend to make the face appear even rounder. Longer necklaces measuring between 26 and 36 inches (66 and 91 cm) elongate the jawline better. If you have an oval shaped face, all necklace lengths should be equally flattering."

      "content": "Know the standard lengths for women. Standard necklace chains designed for women come in five basic sizes. For most women, these sizes will fall around the same place on the body. The standard sizes are: [5] X Research source Choker length is 16 inches (40 cm). Princess length is 18 inches (45 cm), but this size can actually range anywhere between 17 and 19 inches (43 and 48 cm). This length usually falls out at the collarbone. Matinee length is 20 inches (50 cm), which usually extends just a bit below the collarbone. If you need a chain that falls at mid-chest, opt for a 20-inch (55-cm) chain. For a necklace that falls around the bust, choose a 24-inch (60-cm) chain."

Like women's necklaces, men's necklaces usually fall around the same place on each man. Standard lengths for men’s necklaces are: [6] X Research source Men with smaller neck sizes may choose an 18-inch (45 cm) chain. This length should come down to the base of the neck. The most common length for the average man is 20 inches (50 cm), which comes down to the collarbone. Choose a 22-inch (55-cm) chain if you want something that lands just below the collarbone. For a necklace that comes down to a point just above the sternum, go with a 24-inch (60 cm) chain."

      "content": "Remember that children's necklaces have separate standards. Children are typically smaller in height and frame, so the standard sizes for necklace lengths vary from adult standards. Most necklaces made for children fall within a single range: 14 to 16 inches (35 to 40 cm)."

      "title": "Match your necklace length to the occasion and the outfit.",
      "content": "Match your necklace length to the occasion and the outfit. Jewelry should complement your attire, and your attire is usually defined by the occasion. As a general rule, longer necklaces should work with clothes that have a high neck, like a turtleneck sweater. Shorter chains typically work best with formal attire, especially if the chain is short enough to sit well above the neckline of the outfit. The right necklace measurement for a casual blouse may not work well for a formal dinner dress."

      "title": "Double up your chain as a style choice.",
      "content": "Double up your chain as a style choice. Many necklaces often come in measurements that far exceed those of a standard chain. For notably long necklaces, you will need to wrap the necklace around your neck two, three, or even four times. This should be done out of a stylistic choice rather than out of necessity. A necklace measuring 28 to 34 inches (71 to 86 cm) hang at or below the bust and are usually wrapped around the neck twice. Necklaces measuring 40 inches (101 cm) or longer usually land at or below the navel and may need to be wrapped around the neck two to three times. If a necklace measures 48 inches (122 cm) or longer, it will usually be wrapped around the neck three to four times."

      "title": "Opt for shorter lengths when choosing pearl necklaces.",
      "content": "Opt for shorter lengths when choosing pearl necklaces. Under most circumstances, a strand of pearls should not be choker-like or long. The ideal measurement would allow the necklace to fall just above the collarbone or just below the neckline. The ideal length is typically 18 inches (45.7 cm). [7] X Research source If you want to wear pearls for a less formal occasion, however, notably long strands can still work well. You can get a strand of pearls measuring up to 100 inches (254 cm) long. For long necklaces like this, wrap the strand around your neck three to four times so that the pearls do not extend past your upper abdomen."

      "title": "Take into account that pendants add length to necklaces.",
      "content": "Take into account that pendants add length to necklaces. Pendants can affect both the overall length and weight of a necklace. When the pendant is placed on a chain of known length, the bottom of the pendant—and the necklace overall—will extend down your front by the length of the pendant. In other words, if you have a 2 inch (5 cm) pendant placed on an 18 inch (45 cm) chain, the necklace will land 2 inches (5 cm) below the collarbone. [8] X Research source Notably heavy pendants may pull the chain down even further since the weight of the charm will cause the chain to hang taut around your neck."
