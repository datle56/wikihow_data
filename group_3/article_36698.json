      "content": "Protect yourself with gloves. Rodents can carry dangerous diseases and transmit them to humans. To protect yourself from bites, scratches, and contamination, Parker recommends “wearing very thick gloves [because rodents] have very strong teeth.” Some appropriate gloves for this job include work gloves, gardening gloves designed for roses, or heavy-duty leather gloves."

      "content": "Place the trapped mouse inside a container. Pick up the trap with the mouse and gently transfer it to a clear plastic container or box. The container should have surface dimensions a little greater than the sticky trap and should be at least 4 inches (10.2 cm) deep. This will help prevent the mouse from escaping once it’s loose so you can release it into the wild."

[1] X Research source Place one hand over the mouse near the shoulders and delicately hold the mouse in place while you work. Remember to keep your gloves on for the entire process to reduce your chances of being bitten."

      "content": "Dab vegetable oil onto the areas the mouse is stuck. Dip a cotton swab or cloth into a little bit of vegetable oil (or other cooking oil, like olive oil) and gently dab it on any area the mouse makes contact with the glue. Use as little oil as possible and avoid getting the oil directly on the mouse. [2] X Research source You can use cooking spray or baby oil as a last resort, but these don’t work as well. Liquid vegetable oil is ideal. Parker says if you don’t want to handle the mouse directly, “Grab it with one of those three-foot grabber poles. I don't like any of my technicians getting near the mouthparts of any animal, so if you absolutely need to pull that guy off of the sticky trap, try using a tool like a spatula to pry it off.”"

      "title": "Free the mouse and dispose of the trap.",
      "content": "Free the mouse and dispose of the trap. Continue massaging the area around the mouse until the glue dissolves; this may take several minutes. Eventually, the glue will loosen enough for the mouse to release itself from the trap. As soon as the mouse is free, remove the trap from the container. Put the trap in a sealed plastic bag and transfer it to a garbage can to prevent other animals from getting stuck. [3] X Research source If the mouse dies before you can free it, spray it and the immediate area with a disinfectant, then place the mouse and any mouse-soiled materials (feces, nesting material, food etc.) in a sealed plastic bag. Put that bag inside another sealed bag, then throw it in the trash. Remember to wash your hands afterwards and throw away your gloves."

Firmly but gently hold the mouse and use the cloth to remove any oil or glue that may be on the mouse’s paws, head, tail, or body. [4] X Research source Oil will prevent the mouse from regulating its body temperature, so it’s important to remove as much as possible."

If that isn’t possible, ask the specialist how you can treat the mouse for oil, care for the mouse until you can release it, and how you should return the mouse to the wild. [5] X Trustworthy Source The Humane Society of the United States National organization devoted to the promotion of animal welfare Go to source In general, allow the mouse to rest for an hour before attempting to release it. Give it fresh water and drape a large towel over the container so it has a dark, quiet place to recover."

      "title": "Release the mouse at least 2 miles away from your home.",
      "content": "Release the mouse at least 2 miles away from your home. This will prevent the mouse from finding its way back inside your house or onto your property. Make sure to choose an uninhabited area (like a park, field, or forest) so it doesn’t become a pest to someone else. Simply place the container on the ground and turn it on its side so the mouse can run free. [6] X Research source In winter, consider leaving the mouse in your shed or garage until the weather is more suitable. Avoid jostling the container as much as possible during transportation, as this could cause stress and panic for the mouse. Disinfect any supplies you used to release the mouse and thoroughly wash your hands when you’re done handling it."

      "title": "Humanely kill a trapped mouse with a sharp blow to the head.",
      "content": "Humanely kill a trapped mouse with a sharp blow to the head. If there is no way to safely remove the live mouse from the glue trap, it’s best to end its suffering as quickly as possible. The general consensus is that the only way to humanely kill a mouse in this situation is one quick, heavy blow to the head. You must be firm and unwavering in your decision to kill the mouse, as a faulty blow may cause it to suffer more. [7] X Research source While some people have drowned mice, rats, and other rodents stuck to sticky traps, scientists and pest control specialists agree that this is not a humane way to kill them. Parker says, “There is a document put out by the American Veterinary Association about ethical euthanasia. The issue with that comes down to practicality. They recommend shooting the animal in the head or suffocating them in a carbon monoxide chamber, which is not practical, right? But the third thing is basically breaking their neck with a shovel. Hit them in the neck as quickly as you can—the quicker the better.” To dispose of the mouse, spray it and the surrounding area with disinfectant, then place the mouse in a sealed plastic bag. Place that bag inside another sealed bag, then throw it in the trash. Don’t push out any extra air in the bag, as this may spread any germs and bacteria the mouse was carrying. Remember to wash your hands thoroughly and throw away your gloves when you’re done."

When an animal becomes stuck to the trap, it may struggle to free itself and become more embedded in the glue.

However, the rodents they trap often carry diseases that can be transmitted through their urine and feces. When they become trapped, these rodents may urinate or defecate out of stress and fear, and anyone handling the traps could potentially be exposed to these diseases. The animals may also bite the person handling the trap, which could also transmit diseases.

      "title": "What are some safer alternatives to sticky traps?",
      "content": "What are some safer alternatives to sticky traps? If you don’t want to kill the mouse, consider using a catch and release trap rather than a glue trap. These traps secure the mouse in a container so that you can dispose of them away from your house without injuring them. If you don’t mind killing the mouse, a snap trap will kill them quickly so they don’t suffer. [15] X Research source Parker says that the most humane way to kill rodents is “a subjective question, but a lot of people are under the impression the quicker the kill, the more humane the kill. So, a traditional snap trap that will hit the neck right away is our preferred method. That's the fastest way.” Parker also adds that “There are plenty of non-kill traps out there. A lot you can just find on Amazon, and there's a great YouTube channel on different ways to set up a trap that will catch them in a bucket so they can't get back out.”"
