      "content": "Sagittarius Two Sagittariuses paired together can make a very loving pair. They both have a great sense of curiosity for the world around them, and they can easily feed off of one another’s energy. They’ll likely understand each other on a very deep, emotional level thanks to how many similarities they share. However, as two passionate Fire signs, there exists the possibility of heated arguments breaking out every now and then. Rather than a romantic pair, two Sagittariuses are often better off as friends. [12] X Research source Due to their fiery personalities, Sagittariuses can sometimes speak before thinking things through, and this can lead to misunderstandings and hurt feelings. But this can easily be resolved if each person speaks more thoughtfully and makes an effort to empathize with the other."

      "content": "Scorpio Sagittarius and Scorpio are a wildcard pair. They have more differences than similarities between them, and this can cause them to either be a match made in heaven or very incompatible. Both are risk-takers who aren’t afraid to forge their own path to chase their dreams. However, Sagittarius is very extroverted and spontaneous in their actions, while Scorpio is a bit more subdued and values concentration. [13] X Research source To make a Sagittarius-Scorpio relationship work, the two need to spend time getting to know each other and take things slow in the beginning. It’s best to discuss their differences and work on compromsing with one another so that everyone is happy."

      "content": "Capricorn Sagittarius and Capricorn don’t usually hit it off right away because of their different personalities, but a strong bond can form the more they get to know one another. Whereas Sagittarius is very energetic and willing to jump headfirst into new experiences, Capricorn is more passive and likes to pay close attention to the fine details of things. Though they may not be attracted to each other in the beginning, their differences can actually lead to a strong connection since they have so much to learn from one another. [14] X Research source Issues can arise when these two start talking about the future of their relationship. Capricorns often want commitment and security, while Sagittariuses value their freedom and independence. To make this relationship work, Sagittarius must show Capricorn that they’re committed and loyal, which can be done by upholding their promises and supporting Capricorn’s dreams and goals. Meanwhile, Capricorn should be less critical of Sagittarius and give them the space they need to freely express themselves. Although loyalty doesn’t always come naturally to the Sagittarius, it’s a valuable trait for any partner—and especially for Capricorns.

      "content": "Pisces Both Sagittarius and Pisces are very dreamy and imaginative signs, but they can struggle with commitment. Both are mutable signs, meaning that indecisiveness on both ends can cause some issues. They are two idealistic thinkers who understand one another’s mentality well, but it can be hard for them as a pair to create a stable foundation and bring more logic to their plans. [15] X Research source Since they’re two mutable signs, a Sagittarius and Pisces’ relationship will benefit more if both get comfortable with making decisions and being confident in their choices. They can practice by choosing to make small decisions every day, such as deciding what to eat, what to do on the weekend, or what movie to watch together."

      "content": "Taurus Sagittarius and Taurus tend to move through life at very different speeds. As a mutable sign, Sagittarius likes to always be on the move, and they’re usually always on the look out for their next adventure. On the other hand, Taurus, as a fixed sign, enjoys routine and stability, and they likely have no problem with doing the same thing day after day. It can be hard for these two to find the right balance between their needs. [16] X Research source If these two work to communicate clearly with one another and voice their honest wants and needs, they can make their relationship work. Taurus can provide a sense of security to Sagittarius, while Sagittarius can help their Taurus partner relax."

      "content": "Virgo Sagittarius and Virgo may initially be drawn to one another’s intellect, but they’ll likely soon realize that they have little else in common. Virgo tends to be a very practical and organized sign, which is directly contrasted by Sagittarius’ more spontaneous and unpredictable approach to life. [17] X Research source Virgo needs to open up their mind to embarking on adventures and allow themselves to just go with the flow at times. Meanwhile, Sagittarius could benefit greatly from learning to take Virgo’s advice, as it can lend some logic and practicality to their creative and imaginative thoughts."

      "content": "Cancer Whereas Sagittarius is very free-spirited and energetic, Cancer often desires a sense of stability and structure. As a Water sign, Cancer also usually desires commitment in a relationship, but this isn’t always something Sagittarius agrees on. Instead, Sagittarius values their independence and can be quite indecisive at times. In addition to that, Sagittarius can sometimes come off as blunt with their words, which can hurt a sensitive Cancer. [18] X Research source As with all relationships, communication is key to making a Sagittarius-Cancer relationship work. Specifically, sitting down and talking about what each wants out of their relationship and what kind of support they expect from their partner can help lay down important groundwork that may lead to a more solid bond."
