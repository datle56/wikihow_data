      "content": "Set a date to quit. Picking a concrete quit date gives you time to prepare yourself emotionally and physically for the days ahead. Choose a date about a month away, that way you'll have enough time to get ready but not so much that you'll lose determination. Though you could try to quit cold turkey, people who have a set plan in place are far more likely to kick the habit and remain smoke-free."

      "content": "Set up a schedule to help you quit. Base your schedule around how much tobacco you currently use, slowly narrowing down the quantity. Use a calendar to select intermediary dates based on your quit date to reduce your quantity over time, allowing yourself to get used to using less and less. You can reduce your consumption a little each week until you no longer use tobacco. For example, if you use one can per day, start by using one every two days. Then, the next week, use one every four days. Continue reducing how much you use until you are barely using any by your quit date."
