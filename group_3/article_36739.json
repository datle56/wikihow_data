      "content": "Pull off as much of the sticker as possible first. Before you use oil on the sticker, try to pull off as much of it as you can while it is still dry. Use your fingers to grasp the sticker along the edges and pull slowly and evenly upwards. Keep doing this until you cannot remove any more of the sticker. If the sticker tears, grasp a new edge and try again."

      "content": "Cover your work space in newspaper. You might not be able to do this in all circumstances, such as when trying to get a sticker off a fridge. But if you're working on a table or countertop, you'll want to make sure to prevent spillage, as oil can stain some surfaces."

      "content": "Place the stainless steel item flat on your work space, if possible. This will prevent the oil from spilling. Be careful when placing the surface flat. If it's an appliance, such as a toaster, you'll want to make sure it's not balanced on a protruding piece. If balanced in such a way, it might shift as you work and cause a spill."

      "content": "Soak a portion of soft cloth in mineral, baby or olive oil. You don't want your material entirely soaked through, only enough to allow for a good spread of oil. You can use a cloth or a paper towel. If you use a paper towel, you'll want to fold it over a few times to ensure proper absorbency."

      "content": "Dab or spray the oil on the sticker and let it sit. Make sure to cover the sticker thoroughly. It's especially important for the oil to seep in at the sticker's edges, where the adhesive is strongest. Allow the oil to sit on the sticker for a few minutes; no more than 5. The time should depend upon the size and strength of the sticker. [1] X Research source Try spraying the sticker with a cooking spray, such as Pam."

[2] X Research source Follow the \"grain\" of the shine on the stainless steel. If you do not wipe with the grain, you can damage the surface's finish. To find the grain, angle the steel away from you until it catches the light. You should then see vertical or horizontal lines shining. Follow them when you wipe."

If you're using this method on something you can't easily lift, you'll need to bring your flame to the sticker. Run the flame over the sticker for about 30 seconds, making sure to heat up the whole sticker evenly. [3] X Research source You can use a lighter, candle or match as your open flame. Don't worry if you see black marks show up on your surface. As long as you haven't kept the flame in one place for too long, these should wipe away easily."
