      "content": "Flip the latches on the bottom of the door to unlock the hinges. Locate the latches on the sides of the door positioned right on the hinges, which look like small metal arms on the inner part of the door. Look for a small movable metal piece on each hinge. Move each hinge down by hand as far as it will go. [2] X Research source Homer Flores, an appliance repair technician, explains that hinge latches and locations can vary by model, so check the specifications from the manufacturer. He also warns that the hinges could be under high tension, so work slowly and carefully. [3] X Expert Source Homer Flores Appliance Repair Specialist Expert Interview. 14 April 2021. If the latches are in a down position when you open the door, then flip the latch up to unlock it. If the latch is stuck, then try pushing it open with the end of a flathead screwdriver."

      "title": "Close the door until it is ¼ of the way open.",
      "content": "Close the door until it is ¼ of the way open. Position your hands evenly on either side of the door. This helps you keep the door steady and lift it in the next step. Before lifting it, raise the door steadily, leaving it partially open. Flores recommends opening the door so it “stops on its own in the 50- to 70-degree position. [4] X Expert Source Homer Flores Appliance Repair Specialist Expert Interview. 14 April 2021. You may need to leave the door open a little more in some models. Usually you can remove the door when it is up to ⅓ of the way open."

      "content": "Set the door down on a flat surface. The door might feel a little heavy, so put it down and give yourself a rest. Place it with the handle side down in a clean spot where it won’t be damaged, especially if your door has glass. Lay a blanket or towel on the floor to protect the door from scratches."

      "title": "Open the door about ¼ of the way.",
      "content": "Open the door about ¼ of the way. Grasp the handle and open the door slightly by about 4 in (10 cm). Keep your grip on the door in case the door doesn’t stop on its own in this position. [6] X Research source Some oven doors may stay still when partially opened. For this type of door, open it until it can stay open on its own, which will be about ¼ of the way down."

      "title": "Grasp the door evenly by its sides.",
      "content": "Grasp the door evenly by its sides. Move your hands to the door’s sides. If your door is the kind that can slam shut on you, maintain your grip on the handle until you can firmly fold it on one side. Keep your hands positioned at the same height on each of the door’s sides. This helps you lift the door smoothly so both hinges come loose at the same time."

The hinges will slide free from the oven’s frame, so keep a firm grasp on the door. [7] X Research source As long as you pull the door straight back at an angle, the hinges will clear the oven’s frame. If the door gets stuck or doesn’t move, then there may be latches on the hinges that you need to undo first."

      "content": "Grasp the door by the sides. Replacing the door is similar to taking the door off, except in reverse. To begin, lift the door and position your hands about ¼ of the way down from the top. This will give you plenty of space to maneuver the hinges onto the oven frame. [8] X Research source Make sure you have a firm, even grip on the door. You will need to fit both sides into the oven’s slots at the same time."

      "content": "Lift the door to align it with the hinge slots. To fit the door properly, slide it into position at the same angle it was when you removed it. Most of the time, you will need to hold the door vertically, about 4 in (10 cm) away from the oven. The hinges at the bottom of the door should be near the slots on the oven. [9] X Research source Ovens vary, so your latch or hinge system may be a little different depending on the manufacturer. You may need to hold the door at a lower angle to align it with the hinge slots."

      "content": "Slide the hinges into the oven’s hinge slots. Push the door’s metal hinge arms as far as they can go into the slots. Make sure the hinge arms go in evenly and at the same time, or else you may end up with a crooked door. The hinges should pass completely into the slots. If the door looks uneven, slide the door back out of the slots and try reinserting it."

      "content": "Push the door down and attempt to open it. Push down on the door’s corners. This should ensure that the door stays on the hinges. Now pull the door open. If the door was placed correctly, it will swing open without difficulty. If the door opens partially, it isn’t positioned correctly. Remove the door, and then slide it back into the hinge slots."

To lock the hinges, all you have to do is pull the latches up by hand until they rest against the door’s frame. Then, you can open and close your oven door like normal again Depending on your oven, the latches may need to be pushed down to rest against the oven door instead of pulled up."
