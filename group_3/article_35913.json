[1] X Trustworthy Source HelpGuide Nonprofit organization dedicated to providing free, evidence-based mental health and wellness resources. Go to source This is very common behavior in fearful avoidants. It may sound counter-intuitive, but if you want to get back together, make yourself scarce by going no contact . That means no texting, calls, or DMs. Give your ex a heads up if you don’t want to blindside them. You might say, “I think the best way for both of us to get the space we need is to stop communicating for a while. I would love to reconnect once we've both calmed down and processed our emotions, through.” If your ex reaches out during the “no contact” period, it’s best to acknowledge them. If you ignore them, they may feel rejected or ashamed, which will make them avoid you in the future. [2] X Research source"
