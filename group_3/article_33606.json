      "title": "Virgo is an earth sign that loves romantic, sensual things.",
      "content": "Virgo is an earth sign that loves romantic, sensual things. Create a passionate environment with dimmed lights, candles, and romantic or sexy music playing in the background. A romantic dinner for two or a round of cocktails beforehand can round out the evening and get him ready to hit the sheets. Keep the mood lighting on when you two are ready to start fooling around. He’s very visually stimulated and will want to see you."

      "content": "Virgos men are meticulous neat freaks. They get distracted easily by clutter and mess and might have trouble focusing on sex in a chaotic room. Take a few minutes to pick up and organize the bedroom so your man can relax and focus on having fun with you. [1] X Research source Virgo men aren’t super picky about which room to get intimate in as long as it’s clean and orderly. For a pro touch, change the sheets on the bed beforehand so he feels crisp and clean from the very beginning. Your Virgo guy might be more comfortable having sex at his place since he has more control over the space."

      "title": "A Virgo man will make sure he’s washed, scrubbed, and smelling great before sex.",
      "content": "A Virgo man will make sure he’s washed, scrubbed, and smelling great before sex. He expects the same from his partner too, so make sure you complete your hygiene routine before the moment of truth. Try a sexy shower together to meet his need for cleanliness and get in the mood together. A Virgo man is down to get as dirty as you like, but wants to start from a clean slate each time. Virgos are easily put off by bad smells. Smelling fresh and clean right after a shower is a great way to put them at ease and assure them you’re ready to go.

      "title": "Your Virgo man probably won’t initiate dirty talk very often.",
      "content": "Your Virgo man probably won’t initiate dirty talk very often. He’s usually pretty reserved and gentlemanly, so start off easy by teasing him about what you want him to do to you (or vice versa). Escalate your dirty talk to more risqué levels and watch as his excitement and intensity grow. Give him commands like “Tell me what you want to do to me” or “Give me your dirtiest growl.” He’ll love that you’re giving him an order and will feel more comfortable getting dirtier."

      "title": "Virgo men are very sensual and want to take their time during foreplay.",
      "content": "Virgo men are very sensual and want to take their time during foreplay. Let him slowly explore your body. He gets satisfaction from satisfying you, so let him move all over you while he teaches himself what makes you tick. It’s a slow wind up, but the reward is worth it. Your Virgo man likes to be on the receiving end of foreplay too. Take your time winding him up in return to really excite him. Foreplay and sex with a Virgo man are usually long, sensual affairs rather than fiery bursts of passion."

      "title": "Your Virgo man is a perfectionist and needs to know he’s doing the right thing.",
      "content": "Your Virgo man is a perfectionist and needs to know he’s doing the right thing. He might appear less sensual and more mechanical if he’s distracted by wondering if he’s pleasing you. Be descriptive with lots of sensual details while you tell him what you want him to do. He’ll get turned on by the direction and by learning new ways to make you feel good. Virgos are pretty perceptive. He can probably tell what you like based on your body language, but some reassuring words give him permission to really let loose. Virgo men are real people pleasers. The more you share what you want, the more he’ll give it to you. Get vocal when he does something you like. Try “I love it when you touch me there,” “Do that again,” or “Keep going, that feels so good.”"

      "title": "Virgo men like when someone proper has secret wild fantasies.",
      "content": "Virgo men like when someone proper has secret wild fantasies. Start talking about your deepest sexual desires and dream scenarios—the dirtier your fantasy, the more intrigued he’ll be to act it out and share his own. A reserved Virgo man probably won’t admit to his sexual fantasies right away, but by sharing first, you can prod him into opening up too. [3] X Research source Once he’s comfortable sharing, you’ll be surprised and delighted to hear about his secret kinks and desires. This is when you can shift gears and focus on pleasuring him for a while. A Virgo man seems unassuming at first, but will get as dirty as you need him to be in order to live out your fantasy and please you."

      "title": "Virgo men like to take things slow and really savor sex.",
      "content": "Virgo men like to take things slow and really savor sex. They can be fiery and crazy on occasion, but make a point to slow things down from time to time between heated moments. Look him in the eyes, move slowly and sensually, and kiss or make out to give him a romantic reprieve."

      "title": "Virgos are kind of control freaks, so sometimes they want control taken away.",
      "content": "Virgos are kind of control freaks, so sometimes they want control taken away. Try handcuffing or blindfolding him so that you have more power , or institute a “no touching” rule where he can’t use his hands but you can do whatever you want to him. Make it clear that you’re using him for pleasure and he’ll lose his mind (in a good way). [4] X Research source Try playfully pushing him down and getting on top. He's very visually stimulated and will love watching you use his body (and he’ll enjoy getting an eyeful of you in action too). Let him dominate you sometimes too. A Virgo man’s domination isn’t about control, but exploring passion and pleasure in new ways. If you notice him reaching for the wheel, let him grab it!

      "content": "Virgo men like routine, but aren’t as repetitive as other earth signs. Bring in new sex toys, experiment with role playing , or surprise him with some domination when he’s least expecting it to spice things up. Who knows, one day he might even agree to get down in a room where the laundry isn’t put away."

      "content": "Virgo men love better when they trust their partner. A lot of this comes from the time you spend together outside of the bedroom, so make it a priority to schedule quality time and get to learn more about each other. Building a strong mental connection and winning his trust leads to long term pleasure in the bedroom for both of you. [5] X Research source"
