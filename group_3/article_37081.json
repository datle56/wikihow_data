      "content": "Remove the toilet tank's lid and undo the chain clip attached to the lever. Carefully lift the lid off the top of your toilet's tank so you can access the inside and set it on a towel (so it doesn't scratch your floors). Locate the chain clip in the middle of your toilet tank; find the section of chain clasped to the end of a metal or plastic lever running back to the handle. Undo the clasp. [1] X Expert Source Dave Jones Master Plumber, Roto-Rooter Plumbing & Water Cleanup Expert Interview. 29 March 2021. Hang the clasped end of the chain over the side of the toilet or the vertical overflow pipe so you don’t have to reach into the water to reattach it. If your toilet lever doesn’t have a chain , then look for a small plastic box on the vertical flapper valve that the lever goes through. Simply rotate the flapper assembly away from the lever so you can slide it out."

      "content": "Unscrew the handle’s mounting nut inside the toilet tank. Locate the plastic or metal mounting nut inside of your toilet tank where the handle connects to it. Mounting nuts are reverse-threaded, which means they loosen when you turn them clockwise. When you’re looking at the nut from inside the tank, then try turning it clockwise by hand. If the nut won’t move, grip it with a pair of locking pliers to get better leverage. Once you get the nut loose, slide it down toward the end of the handle to remove it. [2] X Research source [3] X Expert Source Dave Jones Master Plumber, Roto-Rooter Plumbing & Water Cleanup Expert Interview. 29 March 2021. Avoid turning the mounting nut counterclockwise since you could strip the threading and make it more difficult to remove. If you’re trying to remove a damaged nut , try filing 2 sides of it smooth so you can get a better grip with your pliers. Many mounting nuts have a black rubber O-ring attached to them, which prevents leaks from coming through the handle. If the O-ring is a separate piece from the mounting nut, make sure you remove it as well."

      "content": "Pull the old handle out from the toilet tank. Without the nut or chain holding it in place, simply pull the handle straight out from the toilet. Maneuver the handle around so the lever slides through the hole in the top of your tank. Once you get the handle out, you can throw it away in the trash. [4] X Research source You may be able to unscrew the lever from the handle to make it easier to remove. Check if there are any screws on the lever assembly and use a screwdriver to undo them. Your new toilet handle will have a lever included, so you don't need to save the old one."

Feed the lever into your toilet tank so it reaches toward the chain clip in the middle of your tank. Push the base of the handle tightly against the side of your toilet tank when you finish sliding in the lever. [6] X Research source Keep one hand inside the tank to guide the lever to the right spot and leave your other hand outside so you can feed the lever in. If the lever angles over the edge of the tank, carefully bend it with your fingers toward the middle of your toilet tank."

Put the mounting nut on the end of the lever and feed it up so it presses against the inside of the toilet tank. When you reach the threading on the back of the handle, tighten the nut by hand by turning it counterclockwise. Then, give the nut a final quarter-turn with your locking pliers to ensure it stays tight.

Open the clasp on the chain and loop the clip through one of the holes. Make sure the chain has a little bit of slack so the flapper can open and close properly. [9] X Research source Make sure the chain isn't caught or wrapped around anything before you clip it, or else your handle may get stuck. If your toilet doesn’t have a chain , slide the lever through the middle of the plastic box on the flapper assembly. Turn the assembly so the box is perpendicular to the lever."
