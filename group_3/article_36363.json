      "content": "Put your clothes in the washer and start the hottest cycle. Place your musty-smelling clothes in your washing machine and add the recommended amount of laundry detergent for the size of your load. Then, turn on your machine to its hottest setting, start it, and let the washer fill with water. [1] X Research source The hot water helps kill any mold or mildew spores on your clothes.

      "content": "Pour 1 cup of white vinegar, baking soda, or Borax into the water. Vinegar, baking soda, and borax are all-natural cleaners that neutralize odors and can disinfect any mildew or mold spores that are causing the musty smell. When the washer completely fills with water, add in either 1 cup (237 ml) of vinegar, 1 cup (272 g) of baking soda, or 1 cup (204 g) of Borax . Then, close the washing machine door and finish running the wash cycle. [2] X Research source For front-loading machines : Pour the vinegar into the fabric softener dispenser before you start the washer. If you’re using baking soda or Borax, sprinkle it directly on the clothes before you start the machine. These products are also safe on delicate fabrics, unlike bleach. If your clothes are very musty smelling, use 2 cups (473 ml) of vinegar. Or, do a wash cycle with vinegar and then a wash cycle with baking soda."

[3] X Research source If it's humid, wet, or cold and cloudy outside, use a dryer instead. Just set it to medium or high heat to eliminate any leftover mold or mildew spores. If your clothes come out of the dryer still smelling musty, wait for a sunny day to wash them and then dry them outside."

[5] X Research source Just squeeze the juice of several lemons into a spray bottle and spray your musty, white clothes until they’re slightly damp. Then, hang your clothes outside in the sun until they’re dry. Lemon juice can stain and bleach colored fabrics, so only use it on white clothes. Diluting the lemon juice in water can make it more color-safe. Just spray a concealed part of your garment to make sure it doesn’t bleach it before misting it all over."

A no-rinse cleaner is a concentrated detergent that effectively cleans the surface of your garment without completely saturating it. So, there's less of a chance that the fabric warps or gets ruined. To use most types of no-rinse cleansers: Mix a capful of detergent with the amount of water indicated on the label. Pour the mixture into a spray bottle. Spray your musty garment until it is slightly damp. Hang the garment to dry outside. If it still smells musty, repeat the process. This method wets your clothes, so don’t use this on fabrics that can’t get wet, like leather or suede."
