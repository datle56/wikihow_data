    {
      "title": "Start by sleeping in your underwear or a loose T-shirt.",
      "content": "Start by sleeping in your underwear or a loose T-shirt. If you're used to sleeping in a full set of pajamas, start gradually wearing fewer clothes to get used to the sensation. This also gives you time to figure out how many blankets you need to keep from getting too cold. [1] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source For example, you might wear a T-shirt and underwear the first night, then lose the underwear the second night, and then lose the T-shirt the third night. This step-down routine also helps you get more comfortable with your body."

    {
      "title": "Keep extra sheets and blankets on hand.",
      "content": "Keep extra sheets and blankets on hand. Because your skin is coming into greater contact with the sheets and blankets, you'll need to wash them more often. Beyond that, you could get cold at night and need an extra layer—so it's worth investing in several sets of sheets and blankets. [2] X Research source In the winter, a good down comforter will keep you warm so that you can continue to sleep naked even though it's chilly."
    },
    {
      "title": "Take a bath",
      "content": "Take a bath or shower before you go to bed. Taking a bath or shower before bed raises your core body temperature. As your body temperature lowers after you get out, you'll feel relaxed and ready for bed. Plus, during a shower or bath you will already be naked, so afterwards, all you need to do is dry off, put on a bathrobe, and go to bed. [3] X Research source Because your body's clean, you don't have to worry about dirtying the sheets up as much as you would if you took your shower first thing in the morning—pretty important if you're sleeping in the buff."

      "title": "Keep a robe nearby in case you have to get up.",
      "content": "Keep a robe nearby in case you have to get up. You won't be chilly on the way to the bathroom in the morning if you have a robe within arm's reach. It's also convenient just in case someone enters the room unannounced or there's an emergency and you have to run out quickly."

      "title": "Upgrade your bedding to organic cotton if you'd like.",
      "content": "Upgrade your bedding to organic cotton if you'd like. Organic cotton sheets and blankets allow the air to circulate and feel more comfortable against your skin. It can be a considerable initial investment, but quality bedding will withstand frequent washing and last much longer than cheaper synthetic fiber sheets. [4] X Research source Don't shun the top sheet, especially if you're sleeping naked. If you get warm, you can kick off the blanket and still be covered. Synthetic sheets and blankets trap heat and can cause you to get hot and sweaty at night, which disrupts your sleep and makes for a poor sleeping experience in general—especially if you're sleeping in the nude."

      "title": "Talk to your partner about sleeping naked.",
      "content": "Talk to your partner about sleeping naked. If your partner wants to try sleeping naked too, you both multiply the health benefits. Skin-to-skin contact with your partner triggers the release of oxytocin, a hormone that makes you feel good and helps to alleviate stress and depression. [5] X Research source The release of oxytocin also makes you more sensitive to your partner's emotions and might even increase your level of attraction toward them—all of which helps you increase intimacy with your partner."

      "title": "Set your thermostat to 70 °F (21 °C) or lower.",
      "content": "Set your thermostat to 70 °F (21 °C) or lower. If your bedroom is either too hot or too cold, you're more likely to wake up at night, leading to a disturbed sleeping pattern. Any bedroom temperature above 70 °F (21 °C) is too hot for you to sleep in. [6] X Research source Sleeping in the buff helps regulate your core body temperature downward. On top of helping you sleep better, scientists believe this might also prompt your body to produce a specific kind of fat that actually burns energy (instead of storing it) and might even help you lose weight.

      "title": "Keep your bedroom completely dark when you're sleeping.",
      "content": "Keep your bedroom completely dark when you're sleeping. Unplug any nightlights or electronics before you go to sleep so you can sleep in a pitch-black room. This allows your brain to be fully at rest when you close your eyes. [8] X Research source Avoid checking electronic devices right before you go to sleep. Exposure to the light from these devices can prevent you from sleeping well. If light from the street keeps your room from being pitch-black, hang blackout curtains for a better night's sleep."

      "content": "Allow air to flow over your body. Since you're sleeping nude under permeable covers, the increased airflow can do wonders for your body. Cool, dry air improves your body's circulation for healthier skin. It can also help prevent vaginal yeast infections and increase sperm count.

Go to source You might also try having a fan blowing in your bedroom at night. The white noise from the fan can help you fall asleep faster and the fan itself will circulate the air in your room for optimal health and comfort."

      "content": "Establish a nightly routine before getting in bed. A good nighttime routine doesn't just help get your mind and body ready for sleep—it also ensures that when you go to bed you don't have to worry about getting up over and over again because you forgot something. [10] X Trustworthy Source American Heart Association Leading nonprofit that funds medical research and public education Go to source Since you're sleeping naked, you want to get into bed to go to sleep to be the last thing you do. That way, even if someone does come into your room you're at least under the covers."

      "content": "Lock or block your bedroom door to prevent surprise visitors. Even if your bedroom door doesn't have a traditional lock, there are plenty of things you can do to keep the door from opening. At the least, this buys you a little time to get dressed before the person barges in. [11] X Research source For example, you can place a chair or piece of furniture in front of the door before you go to bed. While someone could probably force the door open, it would make a lot of noise and wake you up."

      "content": "Set your alarm to wake up before others in the household. Generally, it's best for your sleep routine if you go to bed every night at around the same time, then wake up at the same time every morning. [12] X Research source Waking up before everyone else gives you a chance to get up and dressed and ready for the day while you still have complete privacy."

      "title": "Talk to other people in your home about your personal boundaries.",
      "content": "Talk to other people in your home about your personal boundaries. If you're going to be sleeping naked, chances are you don't want other people to barge in on you. This is especially true if you have young children at home. Simply explain to them that a person's bedroom is their private space and that if the door is closed, they should always knock and wait for a response before entering. [13] X Research source This is also a conversation you can have if you're a teenager or young adult living with your parents or roommates. Even with your parents, you're still entitled to privacy. There's nothing wrong with sleeping naked! It's a perfectly normal thing, and there's no need to hide it from anyone in your household. If you're honest about the fact that you sleep naked, they'll probably be more respectful of your privacy."
