To open Edison, click the Edit icon that looks like a pair of scissors at the top-right corner. Alternatively, you can press Ctrl + E (PC) or Command + E (Mac)."

Highlight a section that just has noise and nothing else you want to keep (instruments, vocals, speech, etc.). Edison works best to remove continuous noise, like a fan or a hiss in the background. You can either select the noise from the wavelength screen or switch to spectral view to see the horizontal lines that usually indicate a continuous noise."

The threshold adjusts the volume at which the noise gate opens and allows sound to pass. Sounds below the threshold volume will be blocked by the noise gate. Noise gates are useful for blocking out background noises, such as fan noise, or buzzing from a guitar amp when there is no other sound. As you adjust the threshold, you will see a vertical line in the window that displays the waveform. Play the audio back to view the waveform. This will give you an idea of how loud the background is and where to set the threshold."
