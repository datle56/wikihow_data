      "title": "”No mames” is a crude exclamation meaning “no way” or “you’re kidding.”",
      "content": "”No mames” is a crude exclamation meaning “no way” or “you’re kidding.” The slang term is typically used to express confusion, excitement, or disbelief—similar to English phrases like “you can’t be serious,” “stop joking around,” and “stop messing with me.” [1] X Research source However, no mames (no MAH-mays) is considered to be a somewhat rude phrase since it comes from the Spanish verb mamar (mah-MAHR), which means to “suck” or “nurse.” So, a more accurate English translation of no mames might be “no f—ing way” or “don’t f—k with me.” [2] X Research source The slang phrase is often combined with guëy or wey , both of which are pronounced like the English “whey” and mean “dude” or “bro,” although wey also implies that someone is lacking intelligence. [3] X Research source The resulting phrase is no mames güey or no mames wey , which both roughly mean “no way, dude” or “don’t f—k with me, bro.” As an alternative, you can say no manches (no MAHN-chays), which also means “you’re kidding me” or “no way” but without the vulgar connotations. No manches literally means “don’t stain it.”"
