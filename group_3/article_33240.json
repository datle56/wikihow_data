      "content": "Draw a circle on the pavement in chalk, or make a circle with string. This will be your ring. Usually, marble rings are around 3–10 ft (0.91–3.05 m) across. For a beginner game, we recommend making your ring 3 ft (0.91 m) across. Draw the circle as evenly as you can to ensure a fair game. [1] X Research source To get a perfect circle, tie the chalk to a string that’s 1.5 ft (0.46 m) long. Hold the end of the string to the ground and orbit the chalk in a circle around it. Or, cut a piece of string that’s about 10 ft (3.0 m) long, then tie the ends together and place it on the ground, shaping it into a circle. Use this for your ring. It’s best to play marbles on smooth concrete, but it can be fun to shake things up! Play on hardwood, short carpet, or any flat surface."

      "content": "Choose a shooter marble. Your shooter (or \"taw\") marble will be what you use to knock other marbles (“mibs”) out of the circle. Choose a marble bigger than all your other marbles, so it has plenty of power. Qualities of a good shooter marble also include a heavier weight and a perfectly smooth, rollable roundness. [2] X Research source Other names for the shooter marble include Aggie, boulder, Steele, king, and middleman. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Place 10-15 total marbles in the center of the ring.",
      "content": "Place 10-15 total marbles in the center of the ring. Play with 2 or more people. Each player scatters an equal number of marbles into the ring. Space the marbles evenly, but try to place the majority nearer to the center. [4] X Research source How many marbles you choose depends on how large of a game you want. The more you place, the longer the game will last. [5] X Research source To start, place 5 of your own marbles into the ring, and tell your opponent to do the same. If you’re playing for keeps, it doesn’t matter if the colors are the same. If you’re playing for fun, make sure you and your opponents each have different-colored marbles, so you can tell them apart. As a beginner, try playing with just 1 or 2 other people, so the game doesn’t get too hectic."

      "title": "Decide whether you want to play for keeps.",
      "content": "Decide whether you want to play for keeps. Marbles can be played either \"for fun,\" which means that every player keeps their own marbles after the match, or \"for keeps.\" If you choose to play for keeps, other players can win your marbles to take home after the match by knocking them out of the ring. Choose how you're playing in advance so you know what to expect while playing. [6] X Research source If you really love your marbles, play for fun. If you want one of the other players’ marbles, ask them if they want to play for keeps. You all have to agree beforehand! Don’t let other players pressure you into playing for keeps if you don’t want to."

      "content": "Determine who will go first by shooting marbles toward a line. Draw a line in the ground with your chalk, then stand about 10 feet (3.04 m) away from your line. Have each player take turns flicking their shooter at the line. The player whose marble lands closest to the line goes first (with second, third, fourth, etc., going as follows). [7] X Research source This method of determining the playing order is called “lagging.” Alternatively, decide who goes first with a coin flip or by playing Rock, Paper, Scissors."

      "content": "Kneel outside of the ring and shoot your taw marble from the ground. Your objective is to knock as many marbles out of the ring as you can each turn—including your own. To shoot your marble, fold your thumb, pinkie, and ring finger into your palm. Roll your pointer finger around the marble, holding it against your thumb knuckle. When you're ready to shoot, flick your thumb out. Always take your first shot from outside the ring. [8] X Research source At least 1 part of your hand must be touching the ground when you shoot. Use your dominant hand to shoot the marble. Some variations of the game give a penalty (like losing a turn) if you touch the chalk circle with your knees while shooting. Decide with your friends whether you want to play with this penalty."

Don't wait until the end of the game to gather your marbles, since you might not remember which ones your shooter got out. Pick them up right after your turn and gather them in a neat pile. [9] X Research source Some variations of the game state that if you knock a marble out, you get to go again. Ask the other players whether they want to follow this rule. [10] X Research source"

If your marble is moved inside the ring by another player, you’ll play from wherever it lands. [11] X Research source If you did knock out 1 or more marbles, grab your shooter. It’s safe, and next turn you’ll shoot from anywhere outside the ring. Decide with your friends whether you want to add a penalty, like a lost turn, for those who move their shooter marble by accident while it's in the ring."

      "content": "Knock the other player's shooter marble out for a quick win. If your opponent's shooter marble is within the ring, it's vulnerable to being knocked out. Players whose shooter marbles are knocked out automatically lose the game. If this person was the only other player besides yourself, you win the game by default. [12] X Research source Because shooter marbles are bigger and heavier, they are generally harder to knock out than other marbles. Some people decide to play without this rule, and play until all the smaller marbles are knocked out."

When you've finished counting your marbles, compare how many you have to how many the other players knocked out. The player who knocked out the most wins the game. [14] X Research source If you're playing with marbles of different colors or sizes, you may want to assign points to each marble type depending on difficulty. If you played for keeps, you take home all the marbles you knocked out. If you played for fun, give each player their marbles back. Some players agree to each give the winner a marble of their choice as a prize."

Give each player 5 or more marbles, and take turns shooting them into the ring, aiming for the bullseye, or center. Once everyone has shot their marbles, count up your scores to determine a winner.

[17] X Research source Trade your marbles with friends to expand your collection. Avoid using your most special marbles in any games, especially if you're playing for keeps."
