      "title": "Intensify your breathing.",
      "content": "Intensify your breathing. Just like slowing your breathing can calm you down, speeding up your breathing can intensify it. If you find yourself losing steam, take a few hard exhales. This can help bring you back to a place of greater intensity and increase your performance. [1] X Research source Your breathing can affect your mind and your body. Intensifying your breathing can also help you stay more focused and “in the zone.”"

      "title": "Move your body.",
      "content": "Move your body. Whether you’re nervous or need to get more excited, movement can bring some intensity right before a performance. Do some jumping jacks, run around, clap, or get dancing. Whatever it is that you do, make your movements high intensity and fun to get you ready to go. [2] X Research source Do some fist bumps or perhaps a bit of exercise, like push-ups, to get your blood flowing."

      "title": "Develop a ritual.",
      "content": "Develop a ritual. If you need to psych yourself up often (such as before giving a presentation or a competition), develop a ritual to keep yourself in the zone. Creating a routine can help to limit your distractions and focus your attention. Whether your ritual is involved or simple, do something that prepares your mind and body for performance. [3] X Research source For example, put on your shoes or jacket as a last step before performing and say to yourself, “You’re going to do great.” If you’re an athlete, have a phrase you always say to yourself right before you perform. For example, tell yourself, \"I am strong and powerful!\""

    {
      "title": "Practice positive self-talk.",
      "content": "Practice positive self-talk. Instead of saying to yourself, “I’m unprepared” or, “I’m not ready for this,” replace the doubts and negativity with positive words. Keep all talk before an event or situation positive so that you feel good about yourself and your performance before beginning. Affirm the hard work you’ve done to get here. Say to yourself, “I’ve worked hard and put in long hours to achieve what I’m about to achieve.” [4] X Research source For example, say, “I’ve got this” or, “Finish strong.” Especially if you’re feeling nervous, affirm that you’ll do great by saying, “I feel calm, collected, and in control.” If this feels like too much of a stretch, try, \"I am strong and ready for this!\""

    {
      "title": "Use visualization.",
      "content": "Use visualization . Visualization can help you imagine yourself succeeding at the task at hand. See yourself attaining your goal, whether that be landing a business deal, winning a competition, trying something new, or getting a first date with someone. [5] X Research source When using visualization, create as much depth as possible. Imagine what your senses are experiencing, what your mind is thinking, and how you feel. For example, if you’re a comedian, imagine yourself on the stage looking at the crowd, saying your lines perfectly and watching people laugh. If you have negative images pop in, sweep them away, and replace them with a detailed specific image."

      "title": "Be competitive with yourself.",
      "content": "Be competitive with yourself. Find ways to increase competition with your own performance. This can help you reach your goals and keep you motivated. Even in the moments leading up to an event, stay competitive with yourself and aim for success. For example, tell yourself you’ll do better this time than last time. This can create a sense of improvement and striving, which can get you pumped to do well."

      "title": "Listen to music.",
      "content": "Listen to music. Music can affect your mood and your state of being. [6] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source If you’re trying to psych yourself up, aim to listen to tunes that increase your intensity. Find songs that pump you up and make you feel ready for anything. They should be high-energy and increase your energy and excitement. [7] X Research source Listen to a hip-hop or rock song that makes you feel good and ready to go. For example, listen to “Mr. Saxobeat” by Alexandra Stan or “Party Starter” by Will Smith. Have a playlist ready for the times you need to get psyched up. You can even find playlists online to help you feel pumped up."

      "content": "Carry a good luck charm. Your good luck charm may be an object that’s special (like a gift from a mentor) or a piece of clothing that makes you feel good. This might be a lucky pair of socks, special necklace, or bandana you wear only for special occasions. Whatever it is, have something that is special to you to remind you that you’re going to do great. [8] X Research source Good luck charms often have some kind of sentimental value. You may have something from a deceased relative that’s special to you or wear the same underwear you wore when you won big the first time. It doesn't matter if it feels silly. There is a value in the belief and ritual of good luck charms."

      "title": "Get psyched with other people.",
      "content": "Get psyched with other people. Being around other people who are also psyched can help you feel excited and ready. If you’re doing a group event (like a team sport or project), be around the other participants to get the hype up. Do something as a team and spend time all together. Say a chant or do a team activity together. Feed off of the positive energy of others to help you feel psyched. Tailgating before a football game capitalizes on getting psyched with other people before doing an activity. Use this same mentality in what you’re doing by being around other excitable people."

      "content": "Have a cheerleader. If you’re preparing for an event, have someone with you who makes you feel good and pumps you up. This might be a coach, teammate, parent, friend, or sibling. This person’s role is to make you feel good and excited. Choose someone who is naturally upbeat and encouraging."
