If the video you want to share is too large for Discord, you can upload it to a site like Google Drive , Dropbox, or iCloud Drive . All of these sites allow you to share a link to the uploaded file anywhere you wish, including within a Discord channel or private message. Although you won't actually be sending the video through Discord, this can be a useful alternative. You can also upload a video to YouTube or another streaming video site and share the link in a chat or channel. YouTube allows you to share up to 15 minutes of video without being verified. To upload longer videos, you only need to verify your account .

Discord's built-in player can play videos in the MP4, MOV, and WEBM formats. If the video is in a different format, the recipient may need to download it and open it in a different app."

      "content": "How do I fix videos failing to upload in the mobile app? If you know the video is the right size and format, but it still keeps failing to upload, there may be a network issue. Try switching from cellular data to Wi-Fi or vice versa. If you’re on Wi-Fi, try switching to a different band on your router or restarting your router altogether. Some users also report that they were able to solve this problem by updating the Discord app, clearing their phone’s cache , or uninstalling and reinstalling Discord. In some cases, there may be a server issue on Discord’s end. Try waiting a few minutes to a few hours and sending the video again."

If you’re looking for a way to automate the process of sharing videos to your Discord server, try a script like Discord Media Uploader . This script accesses a designated folder on your computer and uploads any new files to Discord whenever you enter a certain command. Check out the Readme file on the GitHub page for detailed instructions."
