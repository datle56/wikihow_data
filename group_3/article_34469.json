      "content": "Cover a flat roof with reflective paint to keep the heat off. Cool roof coatings are white or silver paints that are made with reflective pigments. Cool roof coatings are the most commonly-used method to cool roofs because they’re inexpensive, easy to use, and don’t require help from a contractor. Purchase a cool roof coating in white or silver and paint your roof with a roller. Work your way from the edges towards the center of the roof to cover it in your coating. [1] X Trustworthy Source U.S. Department of Energy Official site for the U.S. Department of Energy, which provides resources related to energy safety, conservation, and efficiency Go to source In roofing, the term “cool roof” is used to denote a roof that is specifically designed to reflect heat. If your roof is made of shingles or asphalt sheeting, your roof is already designed to reflect heat and should not be painted. If you want to cover a metal roof, get a coating designed specifically for metal. Cool roof coatings are almost always waterproof as well."

      "content": "Pour gravel on your flat roof if you want an added layer of protection. If you have a flat roof, you can add a layer of reflective gravel to protect the roof from sunlight while helping with drainage. Purchase reflective gravel from a roofing company or at a home repair store and take it up to your roof. Put on thick gloves and use a shovel to spread the gravel out along the surface of your roof. Add a 1–2 in (2.5–5.1 cm) layer across every surface of your roof and use the backside of your shovel to finish spreading it out.

If there’s no barrier, your gravel will simply slide off of the roof over time."

      "content": "Plant a garden on your roof if it’s flat and easily accessible. A rooftop garden is a great way to take advantage of the large amount of sunlight while blocking the surface of the roof from the sun. While you won’t be able to completely cover your roof, you will be able to protect a large majority of the surface. Get planter boxes, large pots, and storage boxes for your gardening materials. Set your garden up on the roof and visit it regularly to water and care for your plants.

Contact an architectural or engineering firm to inspect your roof before installing a garden. Most roofs don’t have access to a running supply of water, so you may need to store water on the roof or run a hose up to the roof."

      "content": "Get a contractor to cover your roof with polyurethane foam if it's sloped. To waterproof your roof while protecting it from the sun, hire a contractor to install a polyurethane foam on top of your roofing material. The contractors will clean your roof and use an aerosol spray to seal your roof in polyurethane foam. As the foam settles, it will adhere to the roof’s material and keep water and heat out. If properly installed, polyurethane foam will last for 50 years.

You must hire someone to install it for you. Polyurethane foam coatings cost $4-7 per square foot ($13-22 per square meter)."

      "content": "Hire a contractor to install a reflective membrane if you have a sloped roof. Roof membranes are prefabricated sheets that are attached to a roof using fasteners. They reflect sunlight and keep weather from wearing down your roof over time. You cannot install a membrane yourself, so contact a contractor in your area to get quotes for a roofing membrane. Hire a contractor and give them 3-5 days to install the membrane.

      "content": "Install radiant roof barriers to insulate your attic. While it won’t limit your roof’s contact with the sun, radiant roof barriers can keep heat off of your roof by limiting the space where the heat can go. Purchase a roll of radiant roof barrier from a supplier and spread it out along your wall. Staple the sheeting into your joists or studs, spreading it out with your hands as you apply it. This won’t actually protect your roof directly, but it will help keep the heat from building up in your roof. [10] X Research source Radiant roof barriers are typically installed in an unfinished attic where there isn’t much interior insulation. Use a utility knife to cut slits into the sheeting to wrap it around any pipes or columns. The barrier doesn’t need to be taut or airtight to work effectively. So long as the majority of your attic’s walls are covered, most of the heat from the sun will struggle to enter your home."

      "content": "Put a fan or AC unit in your attic to improve ventilation. Keeping your attic properly ventilated is an excellent way to naturally lower the temperature of your roof. Install a ceiling fan or set up a large industrial fan in your attic. If you want to cool the attic independently of the rest of your house, install a window unit in a window in your attic. Keep in mind that any of these options will cause your electricity bill to increase. However, your air conditioning costs will certainly go down in the summer."

To increase the natural ventilation in your attic, get a solar-powered fan designed to push more air through the vent.

Then, orient the fan towards the vent to keep hot air pumping out of your home. [11] X Research source The benefit of a solar-powered fan is that it will only kick on when the sun is out.
