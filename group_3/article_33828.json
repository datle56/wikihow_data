      "content": "Make edible school supplies from sugar paste to confuse your friends. With edible school supplies, you can start chowing down on your eraser or paperclips, and your friends won't know what's happening! For instance, roll out three colors of sugar paste and stack them on top of each other. Cut out a rectangular cube, and round the corners to create an \"eraser.\" [2] X Research source Sugar paste is an edible sugar dough with the consistency of clay. It's easy to mold and shape. Another option is rolling out a thin strip of sugar paste and shaping it into a paperclip! Work quickly, though, as it dries out fast. You can find sugar paste, also known as gum paste, in the baking aisle or in some craft or baking stores."

Place the spring on the end of the ink stick, and the glue will keep it from sliding down. Put the pen back together, and the spring will let the pen retract when the person tries to write. [6] X Research source When a friend tries to write, they won't be able to because the ink stick will retract back into the pen."
