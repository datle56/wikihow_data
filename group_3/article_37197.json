      "title": "Enter a title according to the Title policy.",
      "content": "Enter a title according to the Title policy. Be clear, concise, and specific. With the exception of small prepositions (\"the, \"a\", \"an\", etc.), coordinate conjunctions, and prepositions (except for when used as part of a verb), all other words should contain at least one capital letter at the beginning. Do not type \"How to\" as this is automatically added. Don't use possessive words. Words such as \"mine\", \"my\", \"ours\", \"his\", \"hers\", etc can make the writer think they are writing the article just for you. wikiHow articles are for everyone and should be specific in the description, but not specific to certain people. Use proper capitalization for products, companies, locations, etc. Examples are iPhone, PC, BBC, USA, and Myspace. Start your request with an action verb, such as \"Grow\", \"Make\", \"Answer\", etc."
