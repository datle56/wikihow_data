      "content": "Have fresh, clean sets of clothing that you like or get the uniform. You'll need different kinds of clothes or uniform pieces for different purposes: skirts, shorts, slacks, blouses, shirts, jacket/sweater, phys-ed setup, scarf/neck-tie (if any). Find out what is needed at your school's open house day. If your school doesn't have a uniform rule, then wear whatever you want as long as you stay within the dress code. Have a variety of clothing: basics should make up about 70% of your closet. The other 30% can be less versatile. Wear something that the dress code will allow, and try to look as nice as possible. You want to make a good first impression, so dress to impress. If you know you have PE, remeber to bring a gym kit with you. Most teachers will be more forgiving if you forget on your first day, but you may be forced to sit out."

      "title": "Consider makeup.",
      "content": "Consider makeup. Whether or not you wear makeup is your choice, and there certainly isn't an obligation either way. If you do decide to wear makeup, lay out your makeup, and other accessories that you are going to wear, if these are permitted. Try some earrings, or maybe a necklace or a scarf. Just something to make your outfit look unique and don't go overboard with the makeup. Be aware that most middle school students, especially 6th graders don't wear any makeup at all. Don't worry if you aren't allowed to wear it or simply prefer not to. Some good things to start off with are B.B. Cream (lighter version of foundation that isn't as noticeable), concealer (helps cover undereye circles), and maybe some mascara."

      "content": "Buy the school supplies on your list. If you lost it, ask a friend or go to the school website. If you were not given one, check the school website. If they say you don't need anything special on the first day, then bring two pencils, an eraser, some paper or a notebook to take notes on, and a folder to keep loose handouts in."

      "title": "Bring a thin folder for papers, just in case, and a reading book for any free time you have.",
      "content": "Bring a thin folder for papers, just in case, and a reading book for any free time you have. Try to categorize the folder and place worksheets of similar subjects together. This will keep you mess-free and also make things neater for you."

      "title": "Take personal needs.",
      "content": "Take personal needs. It's always a good idea to have some period products (generally pads/tampons) in your locker or backpack, just in case (whether you've had your period before or not) you might have it at school. Try placing them in a case along with other things that you might need (e.g. emergency makeup, spare raincoat, plasters etc.)"

      "title": "Decorate your bag.",
      "content": "Decorate your bag. This is optional, but a cute bag will most likely spark others' attention and interest as well as boost your confidence. Use fabric markers or fabric paint and get your creative side on to make it look more unique or just simply hang a keychain and stick on some pins. However, make sure your parents are okay with this, and that you'll still be able to use it next year."

      "content": "Get dressed. Try to choose clothes the night before. The first day of school may be stressful for you so preparing the night before helps. If you are to wear the school uniform remember to iron it and smooth it nicely to prevent creases. Try to look at the mirror before you leave, to make sure your outfit looks okay. Focus on wearing something that you feel comfortable and confident in, rather than dressing to fit in or impress others."

      "title": "Brush your hair and style it.",
      "content": "Brush your hair and style it. Try to do hairstyles that will keep your hair out of your face because you are going to be concentrating in school. Clip up your bangs or long fringe to avoid it getting in your eyes. Additionally, you can try pulling back your hair and braiding it for a more classy look. Some potential hairstyles include a ponytail, French/Dutch/fishtail/infinity braid, pigtails, half up-do, side braid or a bun."

      "title": "Look presentable.",
      "content": "Look presentable. Take your time on the makeup because you don't want it to look sloppy. Make sure it is even. For middle school you'll probably want a very natural look, so stay away from things like eyeliner, eyeshadow, and heavy blush. You'll have plenty of time for more colorful makeup looks in high school. A full face of foundation is also simply impractical for school. If you want to cover blemishes, a light concealer looks much more natural, comfortable, and appropriate. If you want, try some lip gloss, but don't wear lipstick. You will look too grown up."

Try delicious and healthy foods such as waffles, pancakes, yogurt, bagel with cream cheese, or a breakfast burrito that will keep you filled up till lunchtime. Remember, you may not have recess anymore! Avoid sugary cereals that will make you hyper and then crash halfway through the day. That way, you won't starve all day but stay energised and focused during class. Pack an extra snack in your bag for later on in the day."

      "content": "Make sure you have everything. You want to be prepared and totally ready. Double check to make sure everything is in your bag.

      "content": "Get on the bus, find an empty seat or sit with someone you know, if you are taking the bus. If you're all alone, then don't sit by the window unless you want someone sitting next to you that you don't know. If you are new at your school, then ask someone who looks friendly -- or shy and alone -- whether you can sit next to them. Then strike up a conversation, or if you're by yourself, plug in your earphones and ignore the crowd. If you're taking public transit, make sure to remember your stops! Keep a log on your phone. If you are late to school, your first day might get off to a shaky start!"

[4] X Research source A good way to become confident is by practicing. A good way to practice is by standing in front of a mirror. Look yourself in the eyes, read out a passage that motivates you. Relax and try to gesticulate as much as you can. If you do this enough, you will start to do it around other people too. Confidence doesn't mean you have to be loud and chatty, and quiet people can be confident too. Confidence is about believing in yourself."

Write certain observations and develop a thought process for good and bad events in life."
