      "content": "Drink directly from an unboxed bag of wine. “Slap the Bag” is a super simple drinking game, so much so that there are hardly any rules to it! It requires an unboxed bag of wine, held with the spigot facing down. Have someone else hold the wine, kneel, and position yourself under the spigot (so you can drink without letting it touch your lips). Then, drink for as long as you wish. [1] X Research source Although there’s no minimum or maximum amount you have to drink, be careful and pace yourself when playing Slap the Bag."

      "content": "Slap the bag of wine when you’re done drinking. When you’ve drunk as much wine as you want, use the stopper on the bag to stop the wine from flowing (so none of it spills), then slap the bag with an open hand—like it’s a piñata. Voila! That’s everything involved in playing a game of Slap the Bag. [2] X Research source Alternatively, slap the wine bag before you drink, or even both before and after. It’s all up to you and how you want to play! Just be careful not to slap the hand of whoever is holding the bag. Don’t punch the wine bag; a simple slap is all you need."

      "content": "Pass the wine bag to the next player. After drinking (and slapping), pass the wine to someone else playing the game with you so they can take a turn, too. You could pass it to the person next to you (if there is one) or randomly give it to someone in the group. There aren’t specific rules for this beyond ensuring everyone who wants to has a chance to play. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Take turns with the wine by calling out names. In this version, one person must hold a bag of wine. Then, other players can choose to call out a name and slap the bag—and whichever player they call must drink. The only player immune to this is the bag holder (so long as they’re holding the bag). When they're done drinking, the player called up becomes the new bag holder. Other players can try to block someone calling out a name from slapping the bag. If this happens, or the caller misses the bag, they must drink instead."

      "title": "Toss the wine bag from player to player.",
      "content": "Toss the wine bag from player to player. If you want a little more structure to the game, have everyone sit in a circle. One player must start with the wine bag, take a drink, and slap the bag. Then, they must throw the bag to someone else in the circle, and the player who catches it must repeat the process (drinking and slapping the bag). Anyone who drops the bag or forgets to slap must wear the empty wine box on their head as punishment! (Alternatively, those players could simply be out of the game.)"

      "content": "Choose boxed wines based on your tastes and budget. You can use various brands (and wine types) for a game of Slap the Bag. So, before you pick one, consider which wine you and fellow players will most likely enjoy drinking—and which wine is most affordable if that’s a concern. Options include: Franzia . This is the classic (and likely most common) boxed wine associated with Slap the Bag. Popular varieties include Sunset Blush and Fruity Red Sangria—or Crisp White and Chablis if you’re worried about clothing stains. Bota Box . Bota Box is a step up in terms of quality from Franzia, with more lively, flavorful options for your next Slap the Bag game. Black Box . Black Box is also upscale (and thus more costly) compared to Franzia, with wine options like Chardonnay for players with more refined tastes. Nomadica . Nomadica is a brand offering boxed and canned wines, with premium options if you’re willing to pay a little more, including rosé and orange. Really Good Boxed Wine . While definitely the most expensive boxed wine option here, Really Good Boxed Wine is available to those who want higher-quality wines like Sauvignon Blanc."

      "content": "Drink responsibly and avoid overindulging. Slap the Bag can be a slippery slope. It’s a game where the challenge is simply to drink as much wine as you can, so it’s important to be careful. The game can be dangerous otherwise, as binge drinking can easily lead to alcohol poisoning. Try to keep track of how much (and how often) you drink and have fun without overindulging. [4] X Research source A regular serving of wine is 5 ounces, and most boxed wines have much more than that. For example, Franzia has roughly 34 servings of wine per box. Depending on the wine, it can take only 2 to 4 servings (glasses) to become legally drunk—so keep that in mind as you play. And, of course, never drive while under the influence (or drink under the legal age in your country). Don’t try to finish the entire bag or drink a certain amount because other players tell you to. Know when to put your foot down and ignore peer pressure! Staying by a sober friend who can ensure you don’t go overboard may help."

      "title": "Be aware that games like Slap the Bag can spread germs easily.",
      "content": "Be aware that games like Slap the Bag can spread germs easily. There’s a reason Slap the Bag’s rules above advise positioning yourself under the spigot without touching your mouth to it; if everyone drinks directly from the spigot, it’s much easier to pass germs around. In addition to regular colds and viruses, illnesses like mononucleosis can spread from Slap the Bag. [5] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Mononucleosis (called “mono” or “the kissing disease”) is contracted by swapping saliva, which is precisely what happens when a group of people drink directly from the same tap. So, always take care if you decide to play Slap the Bag. If you see other players touching the spigot with their mouths, consider bowing out of the game or drinking from an unused bag, if available."

      "content": "Slap the Bag may have originated in the early 2000s. It's unclear when the game was created, but the practice of slapping a wine bag after drinking from it started getting popular in the 2000s. One blog claims Ohio University invented the game in 2004, but there isn't much proof beyond that. It's also possible the game originated in Australia since Australian winery Angove introduced the world to boxed wine in 1965. [6] X Research source In Australia, boxed wine is commonly called \"cask wine\" or \"goon\" (which is slang for \"flagon\"). There's even an Australian drinking game called Goon of Fortune, where you pin wine bags to a spinning outdoor clothesline and whoever the bag stops in front of must drink. Nonetheless, Slap the Bag's true origins remain a mystery. It's been a goofy, easy drinking game—especially beloved by college-age people—since the 2000s."
