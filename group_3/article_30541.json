      "content": "In Celtic beliefs, triangles symbolize forces of nature. In Celtic culture, the triangle typically takes the form of the trinity knot, or triquetra, which consists of 3 connected loops. The trinity knot has symbolized many things over the years, but commonly it represents the 3 forces of nature: earth, air, and water. [9] X Research source The ancient Celts also viewed the trinity knot as a symbol of the 3 stages of life—youth, adulthood, and old age—and it came to represent the Holy Spirit with the rise of Christianity. The symbol also serves as a reminder of the connection and continuity of past, present, and future generations, as the loops represent the unbroken line that joins them. Some claim it also represents love, friendship, and strength, especially in the form of a tattoo. Similarly, Norse mythology has a triangular symbol called the Valknut which represents the connection of the past, present, and future, as well as the transition from life to death.

Triangles that are upside-down often represent femininity, the moon, introspection, and motherhood. You might add the moon phases to the design to emphasize the meaning. [13] X Research source Upward-facing triangles represent masculinity, the sun, action, and fatherhood. Add additional imagery like a sunset or sunrise to emphasize the meaning. Combining these two triangles can also represent humanity as a whole. Of course, the orientation of your triangle tattoo doesn’t have to represent these things if you don’t want it to. It’s just something to consider if you already know you want your tattoo to represent your masculinity or femininity."

      "content": "Add a splash of color with a watercolor background. Watercolor tattoos add fun and vibrancy to any design. Because triangle tattoos are generally simplistic, this is a great way to make your design more unique and personal to your style preferences. Professional tattoo artist Burak Moreno warns that watercolor tattoos can fade more easily than other designs. “If you use the watercolor effect as a supporter element in the design, it will work the best,” he says. “Even if it fades over time, it won’t look weak. But if it's the main part of the design, it won’t hold very well. Most color tattoos need a black outline to keep the color in the border.”"

      "content": "Add flowers for a feminine touch. Because triangles are a simple shape, the design elements are endless. Add your favorite flower, your birth flower, or a flower to represent one of your loved ones. Floral tattoos are always gorgeous, and they can hold a lot of personal meaning. Adding the favorite flower of someone who has passed also makes this a great memorial tattoo if you’re not a fan of the more traditional designs. Floral tattoos look great in black and gray or in color, but professional tattoo artist Burak Moreno warns that yellow and white ink fade the fastest. Keep that in mind when choosing your design!"

      "content": "Use the triangle to frame your design. One popular tattoo design is to create a triangular outline and then design a landscape or animal to fit within that tattoo. For example, if you wanted a lion, the design would only include the part of the lion’s face that fits within the triangle. The rest of it would be cut off. This is a unique way to include a design that’s personal to you if you don’t want the tattoo to take up a lot of space. [16] X Research source Some popular elements to include with this design are waves or mountains. When choosing a design , professional tattoo artist Burak Moreno recommends looking at similar images or tattoos beforehand. “You can collect the designs you like as reference images and give them to artist,” he says. Choose your artist based on whether “you like their work and if you think they have a similar style to your reference images.”"

This makes a great family tattoo (especially for groups of 3) because it represents a familial connection that can’t be broken. If you don’t have siblings, consider getting an infinity triangle to represent you and your parents. [17] X Research source"

Pick the location based on where you think it would look best or by the level of pain you can handle . Consider whether you’ll need to cover the tattoo or not, as well. Here are some common placement ideas: [18] X Research source Arm or leg: Your arms and legs are a great place to get intricate designs because they offer a good amount of space to work with. Choose your arm if you want to proudly display your tattoo, or go for your leg if you want to be able to cover it more easily. Neck or hands: Neck and hand tattoos are known as “job stoppers,” because there is still a lot of stigma around them. Consider where you work or plan to in the future before you get a tattoo in one of these locations. Chest or back: The chest and back are good canvases for large or intricate tattoos. These areas can also easily be covered by a shirt if you need to hide your tattoo . Wrist or ankle: The wrist and ankle are perfect for small, fine-line tattoos. If you want something more delicate or something that can easily be hidden by pants or a watch, choose one of these locations."
