      "title": "Consider a history of abuse.",
      "content": "Consider a history of abuse. Children who are mentally or physically abused, especially before the age of 5, are more likely to develop delinquent behavior later in the life. If you know a child who has suffered this type of abuse, make an appointment for them to see a mental health professional as early as possible.

      "title": "Look for antisocial or uninhibited behavior in young kids.",
      "content": "Look for antisocial or uninhibited behavior in young kids. If you notice that a child as young as 3 or 4 doesn't want to play with other kids or interact with family members over a long period of time, they might be at risk for juvenile delinquency later. [2] X Research source If a kid is approaching adolescence - around age 12 - some withdrawal from family members is normal. But if they never interact with others and get agitated when you suggest they do, that behavior might be a problem."

      "title": "Check for signs of hyperactivity.",
      "content": "Check for signs of hyperactivity. If a child exhibits signs of hyperactivity, they might be at greater risk for juvenile delinquency later. Kids who talk almost constantly and rapidly, can't stay still even when seated, and seem overly clumsy in their movements might be hyperactive. [3] X Research source If you think your child might be hyperactive, make an appointment with their pediatrician. They can confirm the diagnosis or refer you to a specialist and help get your child the treatment they need. If you are not the child's parent, suggest to their parent that they may want to have their child evaluated."

      "title": "Study the kid's home and family environment.",
      "content": "Study the kid's home and family environment. Family dynamics and history are the most obvious risk factors for juvenile delinquency. Likewise, living in areas with high crime and/or poverty rates increases the likelihood of delinquency. If you know children who are impacted by these environmental factors, target them for intervention. [4] X Research source If anyone in the family - particularly a parent or older sibling - was a juvenile delinquent, children are more likely to be, too. If parents aren't home often, and children don't have adequate or regular supervision, the risk for juvenile delinquency rises."

      "title": "Find out who their friends are.",
      "content": "Find out who their friends are. Even if kids aren't susceptible to other risk factors, who they hang out with can put them at risk of delinquency. If their friends are anti-social or already engaged in delinquent behavior, kids are more likely to develop that behavior, too.

      "content": "Look into the kid's school performance. There are a lot of reasons that kids might not do very well at school. But if there are no other explanations, like a learning disability, poor school performance can indicate delinquency is a risk. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Intervene with at-risk parents early and often.",
      "content": "Intervene with at-risk parents early and often. Because family dynamics are such a huge factor, intervening with parents as early as possible can help prevent delinquency. Community programs that have nurses and social workers check in with new mothers and infants up to once a week can help encourage better oversight of children and prevent delinquency.

      "title": "Encourage kids to speak with their parents.",
      "content": "Encourage kids to speak with their parents. If kids feel like they can talk to their parents about their home lives or things that are bothering them, they might be less likely to become delinquent. Community and school programs that provide a neutral environment and a mediator for those conversations can help improve family dynamics and reduce delinquency. [8] X Research source If you are a parent that suspects your child might become delinquent, encourage them to talk to you by asking them about their day and their friends. The more open you are with your kids, the more likely they are to be open with you."

      "title": "Make shared activities for parents and kids available.",
      "content": "Make shared activities for parents and kids available. The healthier a kid's relationship with their parents, the less likely they are to become delinquent. Schools and communities can set up activities that kids and their parents can participate in together. It provides a shared experience, and gives kids the chance to interact with their parents in a positive way. [9] X Research source For example, some communities have child-parent swimming lessons and art activities. If you're a parent and your community offers shared activities, try to attend them regularly with your kids."

      "title": "Look for a supportive family member.",
      "content": "Look for a supportive family member. If a child feels listened to and supported at home, they're less likely to become delinquent. An adult family member, whether it's a parent, older sibling, aunt, uncle, or grandparent, that acts as an ally and sounding board can keep kids from turning to delinquency. [10] X Research source School counselors or social workers can work with kids to identify adults in their lives they can rely on. It might then be helpful for the counselor or social worker to meet with that adult and explain the importance of such a relationship."

      "title": "Set the child up in a mentoring program.",
      "content": "Set the child up in a mentoring program. If the child doesn't have a family member who can provide support and encouragement, set them up with a mentor from outside the family. Programs like the Big Brothers Big Sisters of America program are great places to find these types of mentors. If you are a parent and work quite a lot, you can sign your child up yourself. This way, you know your kids are getting positive interaction with another adult, even when you can't be there."

      "content": "Prevent bullying in schools. If you are a school administrator, meet with your faculty and stuff to cover what bullying is, what the school's bullying policy is, and what the consequences are to help everyone identify and prevent bullying. Ask to have more staff present in the hallways, and encourage teachers to address bullying in their own classrooms as soon as they see it. You can also encourage students to speak to a teacher or counselor they trust if they're being bullied. [11] X Research source If you are a parent that's concerned about the atmosphere in your child's school, ask to meet with a school administrator or go to your district's next school board meeting and share your concerns."

      "title": "Encourage participation in school-sanctioned activities.",
      "content": "Encourage participation in school-sanctioned activities. If kids are involved in healthy and safe school-sanctioned activities, they're less likely to drop out of school or become involved in unhealthy relationships. Ask the child what their interests are and help them find a school activity that matches those interests. For example, if they like movies, encourage them audition for a play or get involved with the drama club. If they like music, the band or choir can be a good choice. If cost prevents some students from participating in such activities, look into establishing a scholarship fund that covers some or all of the cost for those activities.

If that's the case, work with the community to provide activities for kids. Talk to the city about converting an empty lot into a community park. Talk to leaders at the community center about setting up free activities like dance, yoga, or art classes. [13] X Research source"
