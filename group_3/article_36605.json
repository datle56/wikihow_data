      "content": "Remove the wiper blade from the wiper arm. Each wiper blade has a connector where it attaches to the arm. There are 3 common connector designs, so how you change the blade on your vehicle varies depending on the type you have. Hook-slot connectors have a hook on the end of the arm that looks like the letter \"J.\" Find the tab where the blade connects to the arm, and either lift it up or push it in. Once released, push or pull the blade straight down toward the base of the wiper arm to remove it from the hook slot. [2] X Research source Pin-type connectors have a small cylindrical pin at the end of the wiper arm that connects to the side of the blade. Lift the tab around the pin with a flathead screwdriver. Once you release the tab, just pull the blade straight off of the pin. [3] X Research source Straight-end connectors have grooved ends that slide into the end of the wiper arm. Hold the tabs down on the sides of the wiper arm where it connects to the blade. Then, just pull the blade up and away from the wiper arm to remove it. [4] X Research source"
