      "title": "Collect eucalyptus when it is in peak condition.",
      "content": "Collect eucalyptus when it is in peak condition. To ensure you preserve only the finest eucalyptus, harvest the branches when they are at their healthiest. This will reduce the time and effort you need to spend pruning the branches later. There are over 700 species of eucalyptus trees and plants, so it can be difficult to know what branches in peak condition look like. Generalizing about their properties at their peak is impossible. For instance, one species (E. dundasii) has shiny green leaves throughout its life. [1] X Research source Another species (E. caesia) has shiny green leaves only when young. [2] X Research source Identify the species of eucalyptus you wish to preserve and check a botanical reference guide to find out what the species you're dealing with looks like during its peak. Use your best judgment and preference to determine the right harvest time for you."

      "title": "Do not collect eucalyptus plants when they are damp.",
      "content": "Do not collect eucalyptus plants when they are damp. Avoid collecting plants right after it rains, or early in the morning when they might have dew on them. If possible, collect your eucalyptus after several days of dry weather. Collecting damp plants could encourage mold growth and will make it harder for the plant to circulate glycerin, the preserving agent that you will use later."

      "title": "Do not collect plants that are damaged.",
      "content": "Do not collect plants that are damaged. Stay away from eucalyptus plants whose flowers are brown or drooping. Healthy eucalyptus flowers are generally white, pink, or red. Healthy eucalyptus leaves should be free of holes and have an even green color."

      "title": "Create a preservation solution.",
      "content": "Create a preservation solution. To preserve eucalyptus, mix a solution of one part glycerin with two parts water. Heat the mixture to boiling or near-boiling. You can obtain glycerin at your local arts and crafts shop or big box store."
    },
    {
      "title": "Place the eucalyptus in the preservation solution.",
      "content": "Place the eucalyptus in the preservation solution. Once your glycerin and water solution is ready, pour the mixture into a stable, wide-bottomed vase. Place the eucalyptus branches in the vase with the cut end of the stem in the liquid. The liquid should reach about three inches (eight centimeters) up the length of the eucalyptus stem. To help your eucalyptus branches absorb the preservation solution more quickly, slice the bases of the stems a bit, or smash them once or twice with a hammer."
    },
    {
      "title": "Place your eucalyptus branches in a cool environment.",
      "content": "Place your eucalyptus branches in a cool environment. Put the vase containing the eucalyptus somewhere with moderate humidity and a temperature of 60 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit (16 to 24 degrees Celsius). [3] X Research source Keep the branches out of direct sunlight as they absorb the preservation solution. [4] X Research source Refill the liquid in the vase as need, since some will evaporate over time."

    {
      "title": "Give your eucalyptus plant sufficient time to absorb the solution.",
      "content": "Give your eucalyptus plant sufficient time to absorb the solution. Your eucalyptus branches will probably need to be in the preservation solution for about four weeks. However, the exact amount of time necessary for the eucalyptus branches to fully absorb the glycerin ranges from about three days to six weeks, depending on the size of your branches. Larger branches will take longer to absorb the glycerin than the shorter branches."

    {
      "title": "Look for black or gold leaves.",
      "content": "Look for black or gold leaves. Once you've placed the eucalyptus in a proper location, it will take time for the branches to absorb the solution. Plants that are ready to be removed from the glycerin solution will change color to black or gold, depending on the species. When all the leaves have changed color, the plant is ready to be removed. Depending on the eucalyptus, some plants may not turn black or gold. Experiment with how long it takes to completely preserve your eucalyptus in the solution."

    {
      "title": "Remove the eucalyptus branches from the vase.",
      "content": "Remove the eucalyptus branches from the vase. Cut the stems of the branches up to the point where they were covered by the preservation solution. Wipe away any excess liquid that might remain on the stems. [Image:Preserve Eucalyptus Step 9 Version 3.jpg|center]] If you plan on preserving more eucalyptus or other plants in the near future, refrigerate the preservation solution and use it again. Otherwise, discard it."

    {
      "title": "Dry the eucalyptus plant.",
      "content": "Dry the eucalyptus plant. Lay the eucalyptus branches in a warm, sunny, dry location with good air circulation. After three to five days, hang the eucalyptus branches upside down by their stems in a warm, dry, dark room. After two to three weeks, your eucalyptus plants should be ready to use. [5] X Research source If you don't intend to use your eucalyptus branches immediately, store them in a dry, cool, dark area."
