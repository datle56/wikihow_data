    {
      "title": "Review the desired qualities listed in the job description.",
      "content": "Review the desired qualities listed in the job description. The employer will use the Hogan Assessment to screen for the listed personality traits. You’ll also need to communicate in your interview that you possess these qualities. Interviews bear more weight than the personality assessment. Study the job description and think of examples that show how you’ve put the desired personality traits into practice. [1] X Research source Suppose a company is looking for salesperson who’s confident, self-motivated, and outgoing. In your interview, speak with confidence, mention a project you completed independently, and describe how you honed interpersonal skills at past jobs."

    {
      "title": "Ask the employer about the test’s role in the decision process.",
      "content": "Ask the employer about the test’s role in the decision process. You'll likely learn about the assessment early in the hiring process, such as at the first interview. Ask your interviewer or recruiter how important the test is, how they use it, and whether you’ll be able to see your results. [2] X Research source Pose 1 to 2 questions politely and professionally so you don’t seem paranoid or anxious about taking the test. If the interviewer doesn’t say, ask if they use the test to make hiring decisions. Some companies only administer personality tests to keep on file. For others, it plays a key role in the early stages of the hiring process."

    {
      "title": "Avoid asking obvious questions about the job's desired qualities.",
      "content": "Avoid asking obvious questions about the job's desired qualities. When you discuss personality traits with the interviewer, don't ask about information you could find in the job description and on their website’s “About” section. [3] X Research source For example, instead of asking “What personality traits are you looking for,” you could ask, “When did you first include the assessment in the hiring process? Has it improved your ability to build a workforce that embodies the company’s values?”"

      "title": "Take online practice tests.",
      "content": "Take online practice tests. There are no right and wrong answers in a personality assessment, so you can’t prepare the way you’d study for an aptitude test. However, taking practice tests will let you know what to expect. Come test day, you might be less nervous and answer questions without stressing. [4] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Business Review Online and print journal covering topics related to business management practices Go to source Example questions might be, “I’d rather do things quickly than perfectly,” or “I like everyone I meet.” Your available answers will either be yes or no, or on a scale from 1 (strongly disagree or least accurate) to 5 (strongly agree or most accurate). Search online for “Hogan Personality Inventory practice test.”"

    {
      "title": "Prioritize studying for aptitude tests, if you’re taking any.",
      "content": "Prioritize studying for aptitude tests, if you’re taking any. In addition to personality assessments, companies often require aptitude tests that measure job-specific skills. Since these tests have right or wrong answers, spend more time studying for them instead of stressing about the personality assessment. Examples of aptitude tests include critical thinking, situational judgment, typing, mathematics, and verbal reasoning assessments. You can find practice tests in each category online. Practice GRE, SAT, and ACT tests are also good ways to prepare for critical, numerical, and verbal reasoning tests. Additionally, brush up on industry-specific skills, such as programs or coding languages."

      "title": "Get a good night’s sleep before you take the test.",
      "content": "Get a good night’s sleep before you take the test. You’ll likely take the test during a second interview. Being well-rested will improve your chances of having a successful interview. [5] X Research source A good night’s sleep is also important if you have to take any challenging aptitude tests. Try going to bed about 2 hours before you actually need to fall asleep. That way, if you do toss and turn, you'll still get plenty of rest.

      "title": "Arrive around 10 minutes early.",
      "content": "Arrive around 10 minutes early. Leave early enough to account for traffic or other unexpected delays. If you’re earlier than 10 or 15 minutes, wait in your car or walk around before heading to take the test. [7] X Research source It’s best to show up 10 to 15 minutes early to an interview or other appointment related to a job application. Arriving late is unprofessional, and showing up too early can be inconvenient for the company."

      "title": "Relax and try not to overthink your responses.",
      "content": "Relax and try not to overthink your responses. Personality tests are simple, typically aren’t timed, and usually only take around 15 minutes. Remind yourself that the personality test isn’t the only factor your potential employer will use to make their decision. If the company finds that you might not be a match for their culture, it’s better to know sooner rather than later. You wouldn’t want to spend months in a job environment you hate. If you took any practice tests, try to treat the actual assessment like your practices. That will help you relax and feel less nervous.

      "title": "Answer test questions honestly, within reason.",
      "content": "Answer test questions honestly, within reason. Hogan personality assessments are designed to detect inconsistent answers and attempts to cheat. In general, don’t try to outsmart the test or give answers you think the employer wants to hear. While you should answer questions honestly, you don’t want to portray yourself as obviously undesirable. [9] X Research source For example, answering “I would do anything to get ahead” with “Very Accurate,” “Strongly Agree,” or “5 out of 5” could indicate you’re willing to do something unethical or unlawful.

      "title": "Respond to “always” or “never” questions realistically.",
      "content": "Respond to “always” or “never” questions realistically. Questions that include absolutes are designed to test your self-awareness and sense of realism. Saying that you always or never do something could tell the employer that you’re not adaptable or aren’t realistic. [11] X Research source For example, questions could include “I have never told a lie,” or “I am always on time.” Claiming that you’ve never lied or are always punctual could show that you don’t like acknowledging weaknesses or have an unrealistic perspective."

      "title": "Review your results with your interviewer.",
      "content": "Review your results with your interviewer. After the assessment, ask if the hiring team or recruiter can offer any feedback. If possible, discuss your results regardless of your application’s success. [12] X Research source If you got the job, ask which aspects of your assessment report helped them choose you for the job. You’ll get a clear understanding of how they perceive you and what they expect from you. If you didn’t get the job, use the opportunity to assess how your personality type fits with your career."

      "title": "Ask about other openings if you didn’t get the job.",
      "content": "Ask about other openings if you didn’t get the job. See if your personality type might be a better fit for another department. For instance, ask about an opening in product design that you’re qualified for if you didn’t get the job in sales. Suppose your scores related to energy and interpersonal skills were lower than the company wants in a salesperson. However, your reliability and creativity were high. These traits could make you a great fit for the design team. Even if the design job pays less, you’ll learn about the company’s products. You might also have opportunities to demonstrate the qualities that the company seeks in a salesperson. You could end up being at the top of their sales team in the future."

Your results could help you develop essential skills for your field. [13] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Business Review Online and print journal covering topics related to business management practices Go to source While the company could be looking for specific traits for its culture, you might need to work on qualities that most companies want to see. Reviewing your results will help you figure out which traits are particular to that company and which are industry-wide. Perhaps companies in your industry want salespeople who are competitive and extroverted. However, you appeared introverted and anxious in your personality assessment and interviews. You could work on being more confident and outgoing by taking a public speaking class or joining a club."
