      "content": "No, it’s about the same as peeing sitting down. In fact, a study shows that people who peed standing up (without urinating through their penis) had no differences between how much urine they expressed when standing vs. sitting. If you like to pee standing up , you can! [1] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source"

      "title": "Yes, if you use the “two-finger” method.",
      "content": "Yes, if you use the “two-finger” method. Wipe your hands clean with a towel and pull down your pants and underwear. Make a V shape with your first and second finger, then spread the inside of your labia minora (the inner lips of your labia). Lift your labia minora up and outward, then start peeing. The urine stream should go outward instead of down and against your leg. When you’re done, wipe your labia and wash your hands. If you're aiming at a urinal , tilt your pelvis forward slightly to aim your stream out and down."

      "content": "Take off all your clothing from the waist down before starting. When you first start peeing while standing up, you might have some drips or dribbles. Take off everything (including your shoes and socks) for a much easier cleanup."

      "content": "Stand in your bathtub or shower to practice. It’s a safe place to practice where you can just rinse off afterwards. You can also try out different stances and poses to make peeing while standing up easier. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Do Kegel exercises.",
      "content": "Do Kegel exercises. The muscles in your pelvic floor help start and stop your urine stream. You can find them by urinating and then using your muscles to stop the stream midflow. Once you find them, you can exercise them by contracting for a count of 5, then releasing for a count of 5. Try to do this 3 times a day to make your muscles stronger and have more control over your urine flow.

      "title": "Wear a skirt.",
      "content": "Wear a skirt. With a skirt, you just have to lift up the fabric instead of unzipping or taking off your pants. If you have the option, try to wear something loose-fitting that’s easy to take off. Wearing pants is fine, but it can be a little tougher to pee standing up when you’re first starting out."

      "content": "Head at least 200 feet (61 m) away from the trail. Usually, this is around 75 paces. You also want to make sure you’re away from any water sources or camps so you don’t contaminate anything.

      "content": "Urinate in a rocky place. Rocks won’t get damaged by the salt in your urine like plants do. If you have the option, try to go somewhere that’s pretty barren already. If you can’t find a spot, try to go in the dirt and not on top of a plant.

      "content": "It’s not ideal, but you can skip it in a pinch. Not wiping after you urinate can lead to bacteria buildup in and around your vagina. Wet underwear also feels uncomfortable. If you don’t have any toilet paper with you at the moment, try to wipe up and wash off as soon as you get to a spot with running water, and also change your panties as soon as you can.
