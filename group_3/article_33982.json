      "content": "Strengthen your body to set the stage for a speedy recovery. [1] X Expert Source OrthoNOW Orthopedic Professionals Expert Interview. 13 July 2021. Although hip pain can significantly lessen the amount of exercise you do on a regular basis, you should make sure your lower body's muscles are in good condition prior to undergoing surgery. If you have been abstaining from exercise, your leg and gluteal muscles may have become much weaker. Ask your doctor (or a physical therapist) for the right exercises to help strengthen your back, leg, and gluteal muscles. This way, your body can support your recovering pelvic muscles after surgery. Some people can do specific exercises that others will have a hard time doing. Go easy on yourself and listen to your body's cues."

      "content": "Take iron, and avoid blood-thinning supplements. Ask your doctor for recommended supplements to take prior to surgery, and follow his or her advice about other supplements you should take or avoid. Iron is often recommended because it helps prevent excessive bleeding after or during surgery. Your doctor may advise you to stop taking certain supplements and medications that may interfere with the surgical and recovery processes, such as vitamin E, gingko biloba, glucosamine/chondroitin, fish oil, turmeric, dong quai, or any other natural herbs or supplements that have known blood-thinning capabilities."

Make sure that all the items you need on a regular basis are at hip level. This way, you don't have to twist your pelvic muscles or strain other sore parts of your body. Rearrange your closet so that items such as socks or underwear are near hip level, so you won’t have any trouble reaching down for those items. Make sure you have a sleeping space in the downstairs of your home available for at least a couple of weeks after surgery, because stairs will be hard to handle. Make sure you have a comfortable bed that makes it easy for you to lie down and get up with minimal support. Get a chair with appropriate support, such as sturdy arms, to support yourself when you are getting up and sitting down."

      "title": "Under your doctor's supervision, stop taking any blood-thinning medications to prevent excessive blood loss.",
      "content": "Under your doctor's supervision, stop taking any blood-thinning medications to prevent excessive blood loss. Your doctor may advise you to stop taking NSAIDs or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs a few weeks before surgery. The reason for that is because NSAIDs are blood thinners and may increase blood loss during surgery. Some medications taken for rheumatoid arthritis, such as humira, enbrel, methotrexate, and plaquinil, could impair your immune system, so it is best to abstain from using these if possible. Also, avoid anticoagulants such as heparin and plavix, because these thin your blood and can increase blood loss when you undergo surgery."
