Place your left hand in the small of your back. Your right hand will hold your instrument, unless you are carrying a drum, which will be held in front of you."

On the count of 1 extend your instrument directly out away from you. On the count of 2, grasp the instrument with your left hand. On the count of 3, bring your instrument into playing position."

      "content": "Find your position number. Your starting position on the chart is listed in a coordinate system of horizontal and vertical values. Instead of an X and Y coordinate, this might be listed as a number of steps Left or Right (on either side of the 50 yard line) and a number of steps in front of or behind the hash line that runs parallel to the Visitor-Home sidelines. Drill charts are read from the viewpoint of the director. If the chart says “in front of” it means toward the director. If the chart says “behind” it means away from the director's viewpoint."

      "title": "Move in equal sized steps.",
      "content": "Move in equal sized steps. In order for the marching band to look uniform, it's important that everybody moves about the same distance with each step they take. Drill chart instructions will be listed in steps. The standard marching style is called 8-to-5, which means there are 8 steps for every 5 yards. Since there will be 5-yard lines on a standard football field, it creates a grid marchers can follow, counting 8 steps between each line. You can also think of each step as being an average of 22.5 inches, since there should be 8 steps in 5 yards. This measurement is often used as a standard. More important than knowing the average size of a standard step while you're marching is to be moving at the same pace as those around you. [2] X Research source"

You will start with your left foot and end on your right. Another common style is the 6-to-5 style, which means 6 (30 inch) steps per 5 yards."

On the count of 1, lift your left heel off the ground, keeping your toes pointed. On the count of 2, lift your left leg into a chair position, keeping your toes pointed. On the count of 3, drop your left leg so the toe is pointed and the heel is off the ground. On the count of 4, drop your left heel to the ground. Repeat this for your right leg."

Plant your heel into the ground first, keeping your foot straight so that your toes point up at an angle and so the bottom of your foot can be seen. Repeat for your right foot. A roll step, also known as a glide step, is a way to march while keeping your instrument level so that it is easier to play."

Turn the upper half of your body (along with your horn) 90 degrees right or left, while keeping your legs and feet in the same position, marching in the same direction they were before, if you are marching. For a lateral slide, do a left or right flank with the lower half of your body, but keep the upper half of your body facing the same direction as it was before."

To crab step to the left, on the count of 1 sidestep with your left foot over your right, taking about ¾ of a standard sized step.
