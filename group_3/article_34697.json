Drain them as needed, so you aren't leaving them submerged in water. [1] X Research source Be sure to remove the ice and let the crawfish return to room temperature before purging and cooking."

      "content": "Pour salt over the crawfish in the tub. Take your salt box or grinder and shake it liberally over them. Regular table salt will do—this isn't intended for seasoning. The bugs should go wild with discomfort when you do this. Salting is optional. Some cooks believe that salting may help clean the crawfish better by compelling them to essentially vomit and purge any mud and waste in their digestive system. However it also increases the risk of killing the crawfish during the purge."

When this happens, the crawfish spit out the grime in their system, minimizing fishy taste and odors and reducing the size of their gritty sand vein."
