The principal is the only one who can revoke the power of attorney (POA) while the principal is competent. [1] X Research source If the document names the agent (this is the person receiving power of attorney for the principal) a “durable power of attorney”—meaning the power of attorney includes the principal becoming incapacitated—the family of the principal can take the agent to court to attempt to get a judge to revoke the POA. It’s very rare that this happens because it is difficult for anyone other than the principal to sue the agent over the POA because typically only the principal has standing."

      "content": "Learn your state’s procedure. Because all states have different procedures dealing with revocation of a power of attorney document, make sure you check the specific laws where you live before proceeding. In some states (such as West Virginia), a power of attorney can be revoked simply by the principal informing the agent of the revocation and destroying all copies of the power of attorney. [2] X Research source However, most states require a more thorough approach. Most states also require that the principal sign a revocation document stating that the power of attorney is revoked. Some states require this document to be signed in front of a notary. Even if the state where you live does not legally require the signature to be notarized, signing in front of a notary eliminates any doubt as to the authenticity of the signature.

      "content": "Send the form to any third parties. If you sent the power of attorney document to any third parties, such as banks or physicians, make sure that you send them the document revoking the power of attorney. You can either send this document through the mail or take it to the third party’s office in person. If you send your revocation through the mail, be aware that the revocation will not be recognized until it is received. Therefore, if your agent acts in accordance with the power of attorney document before the revocation reaches the third party (for example, a bank) the bank can not be held liable for any money taken or used by the agent in conjunction with the power of attorney. [4] X Research source However, in this situation, you would be able to recover against the agent for any damages as long as you can prove the agent knew that the power of attorney had been revoked."

However, in order to prevent any confusion and to make sure that both parties know exactly what authority is being granted, it's a good idea to use a state-issued form as a template. The specifics of the form will vary by state. For example, Wisconsin and Nevada have different provisions for their forms.

It should also name the \"agent,\" the person to whom the power is being granted. [8] X Research source Alternate agents may also be named, in the event that the first agent is unable or unwilling to act on his or her authority. For example, say “Jack Nimble” is the principal and “Jill Quick” is the agent. They should be referred to by those names, not just simply “Jack” and “Jill.”"

Make sure that you clearly and specifically identify the powers that are being granted to the agent, when those powers will take effect, and when (if ever) those powers will cease to have an effect. [9] X Research source This will prevent confusion. For example, instead of saying that the agent “has power over the principal’s finances,” say that the agent “has the power to withdraw money and make payments from the principal’s three bank accounts: bank account X, bank account Y, and bank account Z.” If the power of attorney is durable, it's especially important to make sure that the principal and the agent are in agreement about what responsibilities and authorities are being transferred."

      "content": "Stipulate whether the agreement is “durable.” If the principal wants the agent to have control over certain legal matters (financial or medical) immediately, and wants that power to continue to be valid after the principal has become incapacitated, choose a durable power of attorney. Make sure the form stipulates whether the powers are \"springing durable,\" which means they take effect at a later date and will be not be revoked if the principal becomes incapacitated. Keep in mind that all states have different laws regarding power of attorney, and, in some states, a springing durable power of attorney cannot be legally used. Many seriously ill people choose a durable power of attorney because they want their agent to continue to make their decisions after they can no longer communicate their wishes, and, because of their illness, want the power of attorney to go immediately into effect. A situation for a springing power of attorney could be when the principal specifies in the power of attorney document that the agent would not have power until the principal was 75 years old, but once the principal reached that age, the agent would have the specified powers, regardless of the principal’s capacity."

If the power of attorney purports to transfer a power under state law that cannot be transferred, the power of attorney is void as to that power. For instance, even if the principal and the agent agree, the agent cannot write or execute a will for the principal. Any such will is not valid."

If this is the case in your state, make sure witnesses are not only present but paying full attention as the agent and the principal sign the document.
