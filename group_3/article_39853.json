      "content": "Learn to get in and out of bed properly. You can hurt your lower back by moving improperly into bed. Use the \"log roll\" whenever you want to lie down. Sit on your side of the bed, approximately where you want your buttocks to lie while you sleep. Lower your torso down onto your left or right side as you bring your legs up. You should stay in a straight plank during this motion. To sleep on your back, roll in a plank motion from your side to your back. To go to your other side, bend the leg that is opposite from the side you want to roll onto. Press that foot down to push yourself onto your side. Learn to always move in a plank motion to avoid wrenching your back."

      "content": "Sleep in the fetal position. Sleeping on your side with your knees drawn up can help relieve lower back pain by allowing the joints in the spine to open up. Place a king-sized pillow or body pillow between your legs when you are on your side. Bend both knees and bring them up to a comfortable position. Avoid curving your spine. Place the pillow so that it fits between your ankles and between your knees at the same time. Using a pillow will help keep your hips, pelvis, and spine aligned and reduce tension. Use a thicker pillow if you’re a side sleeper. Alternate sides. If you’re a side sleeper, alternate which side you sleep on. Sleeping on the same side all the time can cause muscle imbalance or pain. Pregnant people should sleep on their side, not on their backs. Laying on your back can restrict blood flow to the fetus, which can affect the amount of oxygen and nutrients that reach the fetus.

      "content": "Avoid sleeping on your stomach if you have low back pain. Sleeping on your stomach can place a burden on your lower back and it can create an unpleasant twist in your spine. If you find that this is the only way you can sleep, put a pillow below your pelvis and lower abdomen. Avoid using a pillow for your head if it places your neck or back in a strained position. [3] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Some people with lower disc bulges may benefit from stomach-sleeping on a massage table. This effect can be simulated at home by removing your regular pillow and placing an airplane pillow around your head. This keeps your face straight down during the night and prevents the neck twist. You can also place your hands together above your head and put your forehead on top of them."

The materials in a mattress break down over time and become less supportive to your back and body. [4] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source There is no one type of mattress that is “the best” for people who suffer back pain, so test a few out before you purchase one to discover what’s most comfortable for you. Some people may prefer firm mattresses, while others may prefer soft. A foam mattress may be more comfortable for some than a traditional inner-spring mattress. Choose a mattress store that offers a satisfaction guarantee and a return policy. It can take several weeks to adjust to your new mattress. If your back pain does not improve after several weeks of sleeping on the mattress, you may wish to return it."

This could be at the beach, in a forest, or even in your own room. Notice as many sensory details as you can about this place. Use all of your senses — sight, hearing, touch, taste, smell — to imagine what it is like to be in this relaxing place. Spend a few minutes in this relaxing place before you drift off to sleep. You can also listen to a guided sleep meditation downloaded to your smartphone or played from your computer. [9] X Research source"

      "content": "Don't stay in bed too long. Prolonged bed rest can create muscle stiffness and increase back pain. Unless otherwise recommended by your doctor, don’t stay in bed for too long. It's important to get up and move around as soon as you can. Getting up even once every few hours in the beginning will be beneficial. Too much bed rest after an acute injury will weaken the muscles and prolong the time it takes to improve and heal. Always consult with your doctor before returning to your normal physical activities. You could re-injure yourself if you try to do too much too soon."

Don’t try to lift objects that are too heavy. Lift from the knees, pull the stomach muscles in, and keep the head down and in line with a straight back. When lifting, keep objects close to the body. Do not twist when lifting. Use a foam roller to help relieve muscle pain. These look like thick pool noodles. You lie on a flat surface and roll the foam roller beneath your back. [15] X Research source Care must be taken when using a foam roller directly on the low back. Make sure you angle your body slightly to the side, which prevents a hyperextension of the low back. Over time, this can jam the joints and cause pain. Leaning slightly to the side can help reduce this discomfort and risk. Set up an ergonomically correct workstation . [16] X Trustworthy Source US Occupational Safety and Health Administration U.S. government agency responsible for setting and enforcing workplace safety standards Go to source Make sure you have proper lumbar support while sitting. A chair with good lumbar support can help you avoid low back pain from prolonged sitting. Get up and stretch every hour or so."
