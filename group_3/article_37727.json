      "title": "Oyster Bracelet",
      "content": "Oyster Bracelet Rolex’s Oyster bracelet is the brand’s most recognizable style, featuring a three-link design with a broad center link flanked by thin end-links on either side. The company developed the design in the 1930s, patented it in 1947, and has produced them in-house since 1998. Because it’s more understated than counterparts like the Jubilee, the Oyster is typically found on Professional models like the Submariner and Daytona. [1] X Research source Rolex watches with an Oyster bracelet usually have an Oysterclasp. Some models with Oyster bracelets feature all-over brushed links, while others only have brushed side links. Almost every Rolex model offers an Oyster bracelet, making it far and away the most common choice."

      "title": "Jubilee Bracelet",
      "content": "Jubilee Bracelet The Jubilee bracelet represents a milestone in Rolex history: the brand’s 40th anniversary. Released in 1945 to mark the occasion, the Jubilee is renowned for its comfortable fit and luxurious appearance. It has more and smaller links than the Oyster: three semicircular center links flanked by two exterior links. [2] X Research source The Jubilee bracelet comes in several golds, steel, and a two-tone steel and gold design. [3] X Research source Some Jubilees come with an Oysterclasp, while others have an Oysterlock. Rolex wearers claim the Jubilee is more comfortable than other Rolex bracelet styles because its smaller links allow it to breathe while hugging the wrist."

      "title": "President Bracelet",
      "content": "President Bracelet Building off the Oyster's practicality and the Jubilee's elegance, the President bracelet finds a balance between form and function. It features three semi-circular links all around, as well as a concealed Crownclasp. [4] X Research source Rolex launched the bracelet in 1956, exclusively for the Day-Date line. [5] X Research source Unlike other bracelets, it’s only available in 18k gold or 950 platinum, making it one of Rolex’s most luxurious offerings. According to legend, Lyndon B. Johnson gave the President bracelet its name, being fond of the Day-Date while in the Oval Office. President Eisenhower was the first to wear the President bracelet publicly, although it was on a DateJust watch. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Oysterflex Bracelet",
      "content": "Oysterflex Bracelet Rolex’s Oysterflex bracelet is the newest addition to its roster. Launched in 2015, it’s sometimes classified as a strap or band instead of a bracelet because it features black rubber instead of all-metal links. Inside the rubber strap is a titanium-nickel blade for strength, shape, and wrist support. [7] X Research source It also has fins along the underside of the bracelet to allow air to circulate between the watch and your wrist. [8] X Research source The Oysterflex debuted with the Yacht-Master collection—specifically, on the 2015 Yacht-Master Everose. Today, it’s also available on the Daytona (Paul Newman’s is one of the most expensive watches of all time) and Sky-Dweller models."

      "title": "Pearlmaster Bracelet (Discontinued)",
      "content": "Pearlmaster Bracelet (Discontinued) In 1992, Rolex introduced the blinged-out Pearlmaster bracelet. Featuring five round and rectangular links as well as diamonds or other gems set around the bezel, it was the peak of luxury for an already lavish company. [9] X Research source Unfortunately, Rolex discontinued the Pearlmaster model and bracelet in 2022. [10] X Research source Because it was manufactured in limited quantities and discontinued in 2022, many Rolex collectors prize the Pearlmaster above other models. [11] X Research source Like the President Bracelet, Rolex’s Pearlmaster only came in gold or platinum with a Crownclasp. Setting it apart from other bracelets, it was entirely mirror-polished for a shiny, eye-catching finish."

      "content": "Oysterclasp The Oysterclasp is paired with Rolex Oyster bracelets. Depending on which year and model bracelet you have, the Oysterclasp may be brushed all-over or polished in the center and brushed on the sides. Oysterclasp covers have the Rolex crown logo on them. It’s the simplest of all the Rolex clasp types. [12] X Research source"

      "content": "Crownclasp Found on dressier Rolex models like those with President and Jubilee bracelets, the Crownclasp is camouflaged with the bracelet’s links for a more streamlined appearance. Its concealed mechanism can be triggered using a crown-shaped lever. The usual folding blades necessary to operate the clasp are hidden under the bracelet. [13] X Research source"

      "title": "Oysterlock",
      "content": "Oysterlock You’ll find the Oysterlock primarily on Professional Rolex models like the Explorer, GMT-Master II, and Daytona. It’s similar to the Oysterclasp in appearance, but has an extra lever to prevent accidental opening. [14] X Research source The crown logo appears on the safety catch, not the cover.

      "title": "Glidelock",
      "content": "Glidelock The Glidelock is unique because it’s both a clasp and a bracelet extension system. Wearers can use the extension system to expand the bracelet by 20 millimetres (0.79 in), 2 millimetres (0.079 in) at a time, allowing it to fit over a dive suit up to 3 millimetres (0.12 in) thick or increase air circulation when the weather’s warm. [16] X Research source Find this extra-secure clasp on aquatic Professional models like the Deepsea, Yacht-Master, Submariner, and Sea-Dweller, always on an Oyster bracelet. [17] X Research source"

      "title": "Easylink",
      "content": "Easylink If you have a modern Rolex with an Oyster bracelet (that isn’t an aquatic model), it probably has the Easylink comfort extension link. Integrated beneath the clasp, the Easylink allows adjustments up to approximately 5 millimetres (0.20 in) so the fit can change when you need it to. Rolex also offers the Easylink on certain Jubilee models, including the Sky-Dweller and Datejust 41, and select Oysterflex models. [18] X Research source"

      "title": "Fliplock",
      "content": "Fliplock Of all the Rolex bracelet extension systems, the Fliplock extension link offers the most flexibility. You can extend an Oyster bracelet by up to 26 millimetres (1.0 in). It’s equipped on the Rolex Deepsea and Sea-Dweller in Oystersteel alongside the Glidelock clasp. Meant for aquatic professionals, it makes bracelets suitable for wearing with thicker diving suits."

The company used to offer Pearlmaster bracelets on the models of the same name, but discontinued the line in 2022. Additionally, some horologists consider the Oysterflex a band instead of a bracelet because it has a rubber strap. [19] X Research source"
