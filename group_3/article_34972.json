Add the line numbers inside parentheses right after the closing punctuation of the quotation. Do not put another comma after the in-text citation.

      "content": "Whenever you quote a phrase or borrow an idea, use citations. Any time you borrow information from another source, you must indicate this in your paper, otherwise it's plagiarism. Use quotation marks (\"Quote\") around the words that you take verbatim (word for word) from another source with an in-text citation in parenthesis at the end ( more on this in Part 2 ). Paraphrases (summarizing in your own words) don't require quote marks, but they still need an in-text citation at the end of the borrowed idea.

      "content": "Create the in-text citation. Add the line numbers, if provided, in parentheses right after the closing quotation marks. Place the closing punctuation after the parentheses. You do not need to put the author’s name or the name of the poem in the parentheses if you include the author's name in your introduction to the quote (eg Robert Frost writes about... ). However, if you do not include the author's name in your quote introduction (eg Some poets write about... ), then you need to include it in the in-text parenthetical citation before the line numbers with only a space in between the two-- no comma! [7] X Research source Example: In \"Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening,\" Frost writes, “The woods are lovely, dark, and deep / But I have promises to keep / And miles to go before I sleep” (13-15).

[8] X Research source Example of one quoted word: Robert Frost uses the word “sleep” to imply fantasies about solitude and perhaps death (15). Example of multiple words: Robert Frost uses a variety of words and phrases such as “frozen” (7), “darkest evening” (8), and “before I sleep” (15) to imply thoughts of solitude and the desire to not return to his obligations."

      "title": "Cite long quotes and short quotes differently.",
      "content": "Cite long quotes and short quotes differently. In MLA format, any quote over three lines is considered a long quote and should be formatted and cited differently. As previously mentioned, long quotes are indented 1 inch (2.5 cm) or 10 spaces from the left margin and aren't surrounded by quotation marks. Because there are no quotation marks for a long quote, the punctuation goes at the end of the quoted material, not after the citation, whereas the punctuation appears after the in-text citation for a short quote. [9] X Research source Example of citing a short quote: In \"Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening,\" Frost writes, “The woods are lovely, dark, and deep, / But I have promises to keep, / And miles to go before I sleep” (13-15).

      "content": "Use short poem titles in citations when you have more than one poem by the same author. If you're using two or more poems by the same author, then just using the author's last name isn't a clear enough indication for the in-text citation for which poem you're discussing or quoting from. In this case, put the author's last name, a comma, the poem title (or a shortened version) in quotes, a space, and then the line numbers from the poem. [10] X Research source Example: The notion of solitude appears in many notable poems including the famous lines, \"The woods are lovely, dark, and deep, / But I have promises to keep, / And miles to go before I sleep\" (Frost, \"Stopping by the Woods\" 13-15). This idea is mirrored in the lines \"And both that morning equally lay / In leaves no step had trodden black\" (Frost, \"The Road Not Taken\" 11-12)."
