      "content": "Get a bottle. Large bottles (1.5 liters or larger) are recommended. Ideally, a bottle with a wide mouth opening is preferred. If you have a funnel you may want to use that too. If you don't have a bottle a cup will also do. [1] X Research source Having a cap for the bottle is also a good idea if you can't dump the content right away."

      "content": "Practice at home. It's a good idea to practice peeing in a bottle at home before you end up in an emergency situation where you must go in a bottle. When trying to pee in a bottle for the first time you might make a bit mess, so it's advisable to practice in the shower where it's easy to clean up. You also might accidentally pee on your clothes when practicing, so wear clothes you don't mind possibly getting wet."

    {
      "title": "Move your clothes out of the way.",
      "content": "Move your clothes out of the way. If you are wearing pants or jeans either remove them or pull them down. If you are wearing a skirt or a dress either remove it or lift it up. Remove or pull down your underwear. If you want to be more discreet, you can just pull the underwear aside, though there's a risk it will accidentally get soiled."

      "title": "Put the bottle on the urethra.",
      "content": "Put the bottle on the urethra. If you have a small mouth bottle and don't have a funnel, spread labia with two fingers on one hand and put bottle mouth over urethra. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Go, but slowly, otherwise it could splash upward.",
      "content": "Go, but slowly, otherwise it could splash upward. Make sure the pee is going into the bottle, and if not, stop peeing, readjust, and try again. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Make sure you don't overflow the bottle.",
      "content": "Make sure you don't overflow the bottle. Hopefully your bottle can hold all of your pee but if not, stop peeing when the bottle is almost full."

    {
      "title": "Screw on the top and clean yourself up.",
      "content": "Screw on the top and clean yourself up. Wipe yourself if you want to. If you don't wipe your underwear will probably get a bit wet, so be sure that won't bother you if you decide not to wipe. After peeing it's recommended that you wash or sanitize your hands."

      "content": "Get rid of the bottle or clean it out with soap or bleach for re-use. Only re-use the bottle for peeing, don't drink from it. You can pour the pee down a toilet or sink, or into some bushes, grass or soil. Alternatively you can throw the bottle with the pee into the trash. [4] X Research source"
