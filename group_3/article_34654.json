Look at other successful books in your genre on Kindle to get an idea of what works. [4] X Research source Think carefully about your keywords. These will be the search terms that people use when they are perusing the Kindle book store. Don’t just include words that are in your title, because your title is also included in Amazon’s Kindle search engine. Use keywords to describe your setting, character types, plot themes, and story tone. For example, if you’ve written a romance novel set in Paris and your title is ‘’Love Under the Eiffel Tower’’ use phrases like “strong male lead”, “romance”, “romantic rendez-vous”, “travel”, and “Paris”.

When you are writing your text make sure that the first couple of pages are really engaging. Have something scandalous occur immediately. Make sure that your prose is impressive.

It tells the reader what your goals are for the book. A prologue sets up a story line, gives the necessary background. Some Kindle publishers use prologues to recap what happened in the previous novel of a series. It is kind of like the “previously on “insert television show name” line on TV shows."

Again, look at other successful Kindle ebooks in your genre to inspire your cover page. And then try to capture the spirit of your book in the cover. Use images that reflect its content. Have a hunky hero with a damsel in succumbing to his wiles for romance novels. Have a lurking shadowy figure for horror/suspense thrillers. Use ethereal images for a novel about ghosts. If you’re writing a how-to guide, use a picture of someone doing what you are writing about. For example, a book on how to build a treehouse might have someone building a treehouse on its front cover. Think about the person that is going to buy the book. What might catch their eye? If you don’t want to pay to have a cover made professionally, Amazon has a cover creator program that is free. You simply upload an image, insert text, and then watch it work its magic. You can choose from a variety of layouts, fonts, colors. [11] X Research source If you have a small budget for a cover, check out 99 Designs or Crowdspring.
