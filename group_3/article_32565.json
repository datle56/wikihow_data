      "title": "Look for water.",
      "content": "Look for water. Usually, water is required to cleanse one’s body before performing salah . This kind of washing ritual is called wudu, which requires that you clean your hands, forearms, face, head, and feet. [2] X Research source There is a more intense cleansing called ghusl that is required after instances of “uncleanliness” (such as sexual intercourse, menstruation, and childbirth). Ghusl involves bathing the entire body. [3] X Research source Wudu is nullified after any natural discharge (urine, gas, stool, ejaculation), after falling asleep, or after any type of unconsciousness. If one of these things has happened to you, you must perform wudu again before you engage in salah . [4] X Research source"

When there is a legitimate fear that an enemy or a dangerous animal is near the water. When using your water for wudu would risk not having enough water to drink later. When there is no means of getting water out of the well (no rope or bucket to draw the water). When using water would be dangerous to your health. When you don’t have enough money to purchase water that is being sold. When water is being sold at an unreasonable price. When there is no trace of water and no person to ask about where to find water."

      "content": "Determine if you have enough acceptable water . If you cannot find enough water to perform wudu, or if using the water you have would endanger your health or that of your dependents, it is appropriate to perform tayammum instead of wudu. [5] X Research source Permitted types of water include fresh water from a pond or well, melted snow, well water, or river/sea/spring water. [6] X Research source Prohibited kinds of water include unclean water, water whose color has changed, water into which something impure has fallen, water extracted from fruit and trees, water left over after animals have been drinking it, or water previously used in wudu or ghusl."

When you find yourself in a position where you need to cleanse your body before performing salah, but there is no acceptable water to use, you can perform tayammum with clean earth/dirt instead. Items on which tayammum is accepted include: Taahir (pure) earth Sand Stone Limestone Baked earthen pots Walls made of mud, stone, or brick Clay Any item with a thick covering of dust The first preference is fresh earth, but if none is available you can choose clay, a lump of sand, or even a stone if necessary.

If you put on your socks or shoes while you have a valid wudu, it is unnecessary to take them off and wash your feet every time you must renew your wudu. You may leave your shoes/socks on and simply wipe the top of each covered foot one time with your wet hands instead of washing your entire foot. If you have no water to wet your hands, you can use any of the items that are permitted for tayammum (listed above) to wipe the top of each of your covered feet. You can do this for up to 24 hours. However, if you are traveling, this method will work for three days. [9] X Research source"
