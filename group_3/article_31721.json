      "content": "Turn the dial clockwise at least 3 times. Turning the dial 3 full rotations clockwise (to the right) will reset the numbers and allow you to input the first number in your combination. In most padlocks, if you don't reset it first, the code won't work."

      "content": "Turn the dial clockwise and stop on the first number in the combination. On your third rotation, line up the indicator on the top of the lock with the first digit in your combination. The indicator usually looks like an arrow or upside-down triangle. Most new padlocks come with the combination etched on the back of the lock or listed somewhere in the packaging.

      "title": "Pull on the body of the lock to open it.",
      "content": "Pull on the body of the lock to open it. Gently pull down on the body of the lock to disengage it. Then, rotate the lock and remove it to access your storage or valuables. If the combination lock is jammed, locksmith Trevor Maclise says you can try pulling on the shackle really hard or pushing the shaft inward a little bit. If neither of those options works, try inserting a small, thin piece of metal called a shim into the tiny gap on the side of the shackle where it locks in place. Then wiggle it to try to loosen the jam and spring the lock open."

    {
      "title": "Rotate the left dial to the first digit of the code.",
      "content": "Rotate the left dial to the first digit of the code. The first number in the code represents the number that your leftmost dial must be on to open the lock. Rotate the dials until the indicator on the side of the lock lines up with the first digit of the code. Sometimes, the indicator for the numbers will be a red line or arrow."

      "content": "Rotate the other 2 dials to match the other 2 digits in the code. Continue rotating the rest of the dials from left to right until all three of the correct numbers are aligned with the indicator on the side. They should correspond with the code as you read it from left to right."

If it doesn't fit into the keyhole, turn the key over and try again. If the key won't fit regardless of what you try, there's a good chance that it's the wrong key. Every key has a different profile which will push pins up inside of the lock and disengage the shackle when you have the right key."

      "content": "Turn the key counterclockwise to free the shackle. Most keylock padlocks will unlock when you turn the key counterclockwise, although this may not always be the case. Turn your key back and forth if turning it clockwise doesn't open it. You'll feel the shackle disengaging and will be able to open it easily once it's unlocked."

You can then rotate the shackle to remove it from whatever you're trying to open. When you close the lock back up, make sure that you feel and hear a click, which means that the shaft is locked in place again. Some padlocks will require you to put the key in and turn it clockwise to lock it."

      "content": "Pick the lock with a tension wrench and a rake. If you lose the key or the combination to your keypad, Maclise recommends picking the lock with a tension wrench and a lockpick called a rake. Stick the tension wrench into the top or bottom of the keyhole and hold it to the side with your fingertip with a small amount of tension. This tension will help the pins stay in place when you pick them so the padlock will open. Then, insert the rake into the keyhole and slowly wiggle it up and down to depress the pins. Repeat this movement once or twice until you hear the pins click, then open the padlock. You can also make your own tension wrench and rake with paperclips or using Bobby pins you have lying around the house."

But the shackle is usually made of iron steel, which is a much tougher metal than you'll find on the body of the lock. If you try to cut through the shackle, you could damage your bolt cutters! Instead, position 18 in or 36 in (45.72 cm or 91.44 cm) bolt cutters over the body. Squeeze the handles and cut through the body, then pull out the shackle and remove the padlock.
