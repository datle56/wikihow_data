      "content": "Single-minded Capricorns chase their goals and won’t yield to anyone. Capricorn is (slightly) more flexible than Taurus in that it is possible to change their mind—if you have undeniable proof. When Capricorn is sure of something, on the other hand, there’s no changing them. Ambitious and driven, Capricorn is particularly stubborn about their career; they won’t put their plans on hold for anything. Capricorn’s stubbornness often comes from their love of being self-sufficient. They want to feel in charge of their lives, so they have a hard time relaxing and letting go. Capricorn is a cardinal sign, meaning they’re go-getters and leaders who like to take charge and make things happen. This determination to succeed makes them stubborn."

      "content": "Leo hates being wrong—so they’ll rarely admit it even when they are. A fire sign ruled by the Sun, Leo has a big ego and doesn’t take kindly to having that ego insulted. Leo is also bold, charming, and a natural leader, and will always stand their ground and speak their mind. In fact, you’ll usually find Leo persuading others to see their side of things, not the other way around! As another fixed sign, Leo believes their way is best. They’re warm and friendly most of the time, but the claws come out when Leo feels challenged. Leo’s stubbornness also manifests in their relationships; they’re incredibly loyal. However, that stubborn loyalty doesn’t always work in Leo’s favor, as they can be slow to leave unhealthy relationships."

      "title": "Scorpio has a strong sense of self and always sticks to their principles.",
      "content": "Scorpio has a strong sense of self and always sticks to their principles. Most water signs are typically seen as having “go with the flow” energy, but Scorpio is the glaring exception. This zodiac sign has an intense personality ; they approach life with a do-or-die attitude and single-minded determination. Scorpio can be flexible, but not when it comes to their deeply-held values. Scorpio’s point of view is difficult to change, and they don’t mind openly disagreeing with someone. In fact, Scorpio enjoys a bit of rivalry! Unsurprisingly, Scorpio is also a fixed sign. They can be a real force of nature and are very determined, but that can also make them act ruthlessly at times."

      "content": "Aries are assertive and spirited; they don’t like being bossed around. Ruled by Mars, the planet of aggression, Aries is action-oriented with a natural affinity for leadership. As the sign of the ram, Aries also embodies a ram’s innate stubbornness—they like to do things their way, no matter the consequences. They don’t always try to overpower people, but their dominant energy makes it inevitable. Aries’ stubbornness likely comes from their deep desire for independence and lack of patience. They don’t want to be told what do to or held back from doing what they want. Aries is a cardinal fire sign. Another go-getter, Aries loves taking risks and throwing themselves into new projects, no matter what anyone thinks of them."

      "content": "Virgo is mainly easygoing but needs proof before changing their minds. When it comes to stubbornness, Virgo can go either way. They’re flexible by nature, but they’re also extremely analytical and perfectionists. [2] X Research source That means Virgo wants solid evidence before they agree with a new perspective and holds themselves (and everyone else) to a high standard—and they won’t settle for less. Virgo’s stubbornness mainly comes from their judgmental side. As a perfectionist, Virgo can be extremely critical, and it’s not easy to change their judgments once made. Virgo is a mutable sign, which is typically the most flexible modality. Mutable signs are more comfortable with change and transitions, including Virgo. They may be stubborn at times, but are overall quite adaptable!"

Unlike other flexible signs, Gemini isn’t so much a people-pleaser as they are just happy to explore, learn, and go with the flow. [4] X Research source As a highly intelligent air sign, Gemini is always looking for new information, so they aren’t defensive when someone offers a different perspective—they’re fascinated!
