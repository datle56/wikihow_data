Once you have your paranoid participants, gather them in some sort of circle—whether that’s sitting on the floor, in chairs around a table, or even gathered around the corner of a bar.

      "content": "Have the first player whisper a “Who” question to another player. On each turn, one person will ask the player next to them a juicy question that starts with “who.” Start with any random player, and have them turn to the person directly to their right. They should quietly whisper their “who” question into that person’s ear so that no one else can hear. [2] X Research source Depending on your group and age range, questions could range from tame and family-friendly to raunchy and personal. For example, a player might whisper, “Who’s most likely to be reincarnated as a golden retriever?” or “Who here do you think is best in bed?”"

      "content": "Have the second player answer the question out loud. Once they’ve heard the question, the person being whispered to must think of another person in the circle that best fits the question. Then, they’ll say that person’s name out loud to the entire group—so everyone will now know the answer to this question, but only the whisperer and whisperee know what the question was.

      "content": "The named person can flip a coin or take a shot to reveal the question. This part of the game is where the paranoia really sets in—the person named will probably be itching to know what question they were the answer to. Did they just get called out as the messiest person in the group or the person with the prettiest eyes? They now have the chance to find out, but this step can go a few different ways based on the type of game you’re playing: [4] X Research source If you’re playing Paranoia as a drinking game: The named player can decide whether or not they want to know what the question was. If they do want to know, they have to take a shot or 5-second drink. If they don’t, they can simply pass and let play continue around the circle. If you’re not playing Paranoia as a drinking game: Leave this step up to chance. Flip a coin and have the named player call heads or tails—if they guess right, they get to know the question. If they guess wrong, they don’t! Alternatively, you can hold a small object in one of your hands and have them guess left or right, or even use a virtual coin flipper on your phone."

They turn to the person to their right, whisper a question into their ear, and that player announces their answer to the group. Play continues like this until everyone is bored, drunk, or otherwise ready to move on! [5] X Research source"

However, some other items can make your game more fast-paced or turn it into a drinking game (for those of legal drinking age). To play Paranoia, it’s best if you have: At least 3 people (although the more the better—there’s no max amount of players!) A coin, small object, or alcohol (if you decide to play Paranoia as a drinking game). A great list of Paranoia questions to get your gears churning."
