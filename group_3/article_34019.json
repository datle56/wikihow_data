[1] X Expert Source Shira Tsvi Personal Trainer & Fitness Instructor Expert Interview. 7 January 2020. Aim to drink one glass of water every hour up until you set out on your run. You need to drink water to stay hydrated and energized. [2] X Research source Aim for 8-16oz of water 1-2 hours before running."

      "content": "Eat a simple meal 2-3 hours before you plan on running. You don't need to eat a lot unless you plan on running more than 12-13 miles. A bagel with honey or jam, a granola bar and fruit, or a peanut butter and jelly sandwich will provide fuel that your body can digest quickly. [3] X Expert Source Shira Tsvi Personal Trainer & Fitness Instructor Expert Interview. 7 January 2020. Avoid slow to digest foods like thick pasta sauces, fried foods, or cheeses. Aim for a simple combination of carbohydrates (bagel, toast, granola, oatmeal), natural sugar (jelly, banana, apple, honey), and protein (peanut butter, yogurt, grilled chicken)."

      "content": "Set a reasonable goal. This is especially important if you are just beginning to run regularly. Use a map or a running specific app, like MapMyRun, to plan out a route that works for you. A good start for your first few weeks is 20-30 minutes, running 2-3 miles at a time. As you progress, listen to your body -- if your muscles and joints are hurting after every run, slow down and do less mileage until you are better prepared."

      "content": "Dress to exercise. You should wear light, breathable clothing that doesn't trap sweat. [4] X Expert Source Shira Tsvi Personal Trainer & Fitness Instructor Expert Interview. 7 January 2020. If you are going for a short run, then a cotton shirt will be fine, but you should use synthetic athletic wear for longer runs. Your body will raise it's temperature by 10-15 degrees, so dress as if the weather is 10-15 degrees warmer. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Buy running shoes.",
      "content": "Buy running shoes. Make sure your sneakers fit by trying them out on short runs. If you get any blisters or feel numbness in your toes, you need better-fitting shoes. Your heel should stay snugly in the shoe. You should have room to wiggle your toes. The balls and arches of your feet should be comfortable but not tight. [6] X Research source There is a growing movement to run barefoot for it's supposed health benefits, but only try it if you are sure you will not step on anything dangerous. [7] X Research source"

      "title": "Taper your exercise schedule a week before the race.",
      "content": "Taper your exercise schedule a week before the race. Tapering is when you ease off your workouts before the race, allowing your muscles plenty of time to recover. Make your runs shorter and slower, and switch to other activities you do regularly like biking or swimming (nothing new) 2-3 days before the race to rest your running-specific muscles. Resist the urge to train hard at the last minute -- it will make you less effective when race day arrives [8] X Research source It takes upwards of 6 weeks for you body to benefit from hard training, so a hard workout two days before the race won't help you. Marathon runners often begin tapering 3-4 weeks before a race, lowering their training mileage by 10 miles each week. [9] X Research source Either rest completely or take it very slow the day before the race."

      "content": "Monitor your diet at least three days before the race. Your body needs the right fuel to be effective, and eating junk food even 2-3 days before the race can make you feel sluggish. Avoid rich and fatty foods like donuts or bacon at least three days before race time and try to eat more carbohydrates (pasta, bread, etc) to prepare. Your body has the ability to store almost 2,000 calories in carbohydrates, and you'll need them to run effectively. [10] X Research source Day 1: Eat lots of complex carbs -- starchy foods like whole wheat pasta and bread, oatmeal, and quinoa. This allows your body to digest fully a few days in advance. Day 2: Begin switching to simple carbs like fruits, pasta, and white bread. Cut any junk food from your diet now. Day 3: Keep eating simple carbohydrates, like a big plate of pasta with marinara sauce. Try to eat your last big meal 12-15 hours before the race. [11] X Research source Try this diet out a few days before a training day to see how your body feels with different foods."

You should be drinking 4-8 ounces of water every hour at least two days before the race, along with foods rich in electrolytes (bananas and pretzels are great). A few hours before the race, drink 16oz of water to prepare. [12] X Research source Do not \"over drink\" by chugging right before the race -- your body won't have time to absorb it and you will feel bloated."

[14] X Research source You should mix light stretching with a \"dynamic stretch,\" which is a small exercise meant to get your blood flowing and your muscles loose. Jog lightly for 10-15 minutes, gradually increasing pace. Lightly stretch each muscle, holding for no more than 10 seconds each. Slowly jog for another 10 minutes. Mix in 3-5 lunges, squats, skips, and jumps to warm up specific muscles. [15] X Research source"

      "content": "Mix high knees, butt kicks, and shuffling into your warm-up run. These are exaggerated runs that warm up specific muscles and help your legs prepare for a full range of motion. Do each of these \"dynamic stretches\" for at least a minute, or try skipping as well. High Knees: With every step, lift each knee up to hip height. Butt Kicks: Exaggerate lifting your back leg so your heel comes up and taps your buttocks. Shuffle Step: Turn sideways and move horizontally for 3-4 steps. Pivot on your front foot and face the other direction, shuffling for 3-4 steps before alternating again."

      "content": "Warm up you hip muscles. These often forgotten muscles need to be loose for a smooth running motion. Take some time to do \"hip openers and closers\" to get ready. Hip Openers: Walking laterally (side to side), lift your front knee up to hip height and then slowly arc it out to the side, turning you the other direction. Repeat with the other foot. Hip Closers: Walking laterally, pick up your back leg and arc it in front of your body. Pivot on your balancing foot so that you face the other direction and repeat."

Get them firing with some lunges: Step forward with one foot, bending 90 degrees at the knee. Rest on the toes of your back foot. Drop your hips down towards the ground, keeping your front knee bent at 90. Keep your back straight as your drop. Pick up your back foot and step forward with it, repeating on the other side of your body. Repeat 10-15 times on each side."

Return to standing position and then bend backward, thrusting your stomach out. Perform several twists to either side, turning from your hips, and then bend sideways each way while keeping your feet in place. These stretches loosen muscles and joints in your spine to prepare it for running. [16] X Research source"

Many studies show that static stretching can actually decrease by performance by tearing muscle fibers. [17] X Research source After warming up, limit yourself to a few light 10-15 second stretches on any muscles that are still sore. A stretch should never hurt -- so don't push yourself thinking that you are getting a \"better\" stretch. [18] X Research source"
