      "title": "Write out a list of all the Pokémon you like or would want on a team.",
      "content": "Write out a list of all the Pokémon you like or would want on a team. It can be a list of anything, but you should write down all the types you would like (all types if you're unsure) and categorize each Pokémon you find under the types. If you wanted fire, water, grass, psychic, dark, ghost and dragon on your team, but no bug or poison, that's where you would start. Water, Fire, Grass, Electric, and Flying are the most important types to get in your journey make sure you get them. Also, try looking at websites like Smogon.com, or at a picture of all the Pokémon to help you remember all of them. Write down the highest evolution, marriland.com, Pokémon.com, and serribi.net or .com - what you're going to end up with, and next to it write the lowest evolution - the one you're going to be stuck with for a while. And also make sure your Pokémon are at level 15 when you got to your first gym them 20-25 third 30- 35 if you can and so on. If you can tolerate both of those Pokémon, keep them on the list."

      "content": "On your list of Pokémon, put an F next to all Pokémon that can learn 'Fly' and an S next to all those who can learn 'Surf'. You're going to need these Pokémon while playing the game, and you should have one of each for your new team."
    },
    {
      "title": "Get one Pokémon in each type category.",
      "content": "Get one Pokémon in each type category. The best way to do this is to go on websites like Smogon.com and see which would be right for you. Look at their stats, what their greatest weaknesses are, and what moveset is best for that Pokémon. For example, if you have Poliwrath, Vaporeon, and Kabutops under 'Water', you would search each one individually on Smogon to see which is the best. In this example, say you actually wanted Poliwrath more but Kabutops looks like the stronger Pokémon, you would have to find the deciding factor - the moveset, perhaps, or maybe Kabuto takes too long to evolve. Perhaps Vaporeon doesn't have the best range of moves. These are all things to consider. Hopefully you'll be able to chip the categories down to one Pokémon."
    },
    {
      "title": "Get it down further.",
      "content": "Get it down further. Now you'll want to move off of that paper and start on a fresh one. Write all the remaining Pokémon on that paper. It's a good time to reconsider your choices. Try to visualize using that Pokémon. Research the moves it can learn, what levels it evolves on (or how it evolves), its maximum stats, its secondary typing in comparison to the other choices. If you can't get eggs for these Pokémon or get them in the game, how will they be obtained? Think of every aspect while crossing out the potential teammates. You should still reference Smogon while making these choices."
    },
    {
      "title": "Wait until you've gotten six.",
      "content": "Wait until you've gotten six. You can either start the game and start catching, or do it the way most people do it: Pokémon breeding. This, of course, warrants the use of an already used game, which you will hopefully have. With the desired moveset in mind, research each of the six Pokémon on Serebii.net (make sure it's the right game you're looking under). Pay close attention to each of the egg moves the Pokémon has, and see if it's a possibility to give to your new baby Pokémon. For example, if you chose Houndoom and you want it to know Nasty Plot right away, you would want to fin two compatible Pokémon (all on Serebii.net) that would give the egg Houndour Nasty Plot (a move it does not learn until past level 60). The father Pokémon gives the moves, the mother Pokémon gives the species, so to get a Nasty Plot Houndour, you could breed a boy Shiftry with Nasty Plot with a girl Houndoom. Once you have the eggs for all the Pokémon, get a Pokémon with Flame Body (Slugma, for example) or Magma Armor in your party and get hatchin'. If you have any TMs, use them (if we were to continue the Houndour example, perhaps Dark Pulse is a move you would want, a TM that is easily bought in the Celadon Department store). Pay attention to the EVs your Pokémon need to learn, perhaps give them some EV-upping items."

      "title": "Get all the new little Pokémon onto your new game.",
      "content": "Get all the new little Pokémon onto your new game. It's a wise idea to level up the Pokémon just a little; level one Pokémon are rather puny. If you did not hatch the new Pokémon on the same game, be cautious about getting them over a certain level because without the proper gym badges they will stop listening to you (get your Pokémon to beat the first gym leader before they're level 10, for example). Train good and train hard - do what's necessary to earn moves and evolve."
