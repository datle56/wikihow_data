      "title": "Avoid using spray paints, as they will dissolve the styrofoam.",
      "content": "Avoid using spray paints, as they will dissolve the styrofoam. Regular spray paints, such as latex or enamel ones, eat up the styrofoam once you spray the paint onto it. If you want to keep your styrofoam's shape and texture the same when you're painting it, stay away from spray paints. [1] X Research source The chemicals in the spray paint are what cause it to destroy the styrofoam."

      "title": "Purchase a craft acrylic paint in your desired color.",
      "content": "Purchase a craft acrylic paint in your desired color. Acrylic paint is the best type of paint you can use on styrofoam, as it won't cause damage and sticks to the styrofoam well. Visit your local craft store or go online to find acrylic paint in a color of your choosing."

      "title": "Pick out enough paint to cover all of the styrofoam.",
      "content": "Pick out enough paint to cover all of the styrofoam. If you're just painting a few styrofoam balls or a small styrofoam cube, you'll likely only need a small bottle of paint, roughly 2 ounces (57 g). For larger projects, consider buying a bigger container of paint so that you'll have enough for several coats. [2] X Research source If you're not sure how much paint you'll need, choose a color that you can easily buy more of if necessary."

      "title": "Seal your styrofoam if you have to use a paint that doesn't adhere well.",
      "content": "Seal your styrofoam if you have to use a paint that doesn't adhere well. You can use a regular craft sealant such as Mod Podge, or you can target the styrofoam specifically and use something like Foam Finish. Apply the sealant using a foam brush or regular paint brush and then let it dry completely before painting the styrofoam. [3] X Research source Foam Finish fills in the cracks of styrofoam and provides a solid base for you to paint over. Follow the instructions on the specific sealant to learn about drying times and whether it needs additional coats."

      "title": "Dip your foam brush in the poured paint.",
      "content": "Dip your foam brush in the poured paint. Pour your paint onto a paper plate or scrap piece of paper to easily dip your brush. Take the foam brush and dip it into the paint, gathering a small amount on your brush. [4] X Research source Pour small amounts of paint onto the plate at firstâ€”you can always add more if necessary. If you don't have a foam brush, a regular soft bristle paint brush will also work."

    {
      "title": "Spread the paint on the styrofoam in an even layer.",
      "content": "Spread the paint on the styrofoam in an even layer. Use your foam brush to apply the paint in even strokes across the styrofoam. You may need to dab the paint into the cracks and white spots in the styrofoam so that the paint looks even. [5] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Wait 10-20 minutes for the paint to dry.",
      "content": "Wait 10-20 minutes for the paint to dry. Paints that you would use on the styrofoam, like acrylic, dry very quickly and should be ready for a second coat after roughly 10 minutes. Styrofoam is very porous, so check the styrofoam after the paint dries to see if it needs another layer of paint to cover up any white specks. [6] X Research source Use your finger to touch the styrofoam to see if the paint is still wet."
    },
    {
      "title": "Apply additional coats of paint until you're satisfied with the result.",
      "content": "Apply additional coats of paint until you're satisfied with the result. Continue using the foam brush to cover the styrofoam in even coats of paint, letting each coat dry before adding another one. Once there aren't any white specks and the color is bright and solid, let your styrofoam dry one last time before calling it finished. [7] X Research source"
