    {
      "title": "She wants to know if you’re on the market.",
      "content": "She wants to know if you’re on the market. This might be the most cut-and-dry question on this list. She doesn’t want to come right out and ask if you’re single—that’s a bit too obvious. Instead, she asks if you’re partnered or seeing anyone. The implication, of course, is that she’s hoping you’re available. [1] X Research source To give a slick, suave answer, say, “Not yet. Are you interested?” For a less forward answer, say, “Not at the moment, but I’m open to it.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "She’s trying to see if you might be interested in her.",
      "content": "She’s trying to see if you might be interested in her. The implied question is, “Am I your type?” [2] X Research source It’s a strong sign that she’s into you, and she’s casting a line to see if you bite. If she checks your boxes, go ahead and take that bait. Flirt with her by loosely describing her own appearance. Say something like, “I tend to go for girls who are shorter than me, have brown hair, green eyes, and a killer personality.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "She’s getting your info so you can link up later.",
      "content": "She’s getting your info so you can link up later. Asking for contact deets like your phone number or social media handles is a classic green flag, especially when it’s the girl asking you, rather than the other way around. [3] X Research source She’s decided you’re worth her time, and she’d like to spend more of that time with you. Go ahead and drop your number, but be sure to ask for hers , as well, to show her that you’re just as interested. And don’t hesitate to text her first."
    },
    {
      "title": "She wants to hang out to get to know you better.",
      "content": "She wants to hang out to get to know you better. You’ve caught her eye, and she wants to see where this goes. If it’s drinks or dinner—bingo—that’s a date. [4] X Research source If it’s more of a group activity, like a party or a hangout, it’s not a done deal, but it’s still an opportunity to get to know her. Accept the invite, and ask her what she’s got in mind. Say, “I’d love to, what are you thinking?” If she doesn’t have anything in particular in mind, take the opportunity to make it a date . Go lowkey, like a bar or a coffee shop, to keep it casual."
    },
    {
      "title": "She’s subtly asking you to check her out.",
      "content": "She’s subtly asking you to check her out. If she asks your opinion on a dress, her jewelry, or any other part of her outfit, she’s trying catch your attention. [5] X Research source It gives her an excuse to show off a little bit, and she’s also testing to see if you’re attracted to her. Give her a respectful compliment , one that flatters but doesn’t objectify her. Say something like, “I can’t imagine anything not looking good on you.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "She trusts you enough to ask your honest opinion.",
      "content": "She trusts you enough to ask your honest opinion. You’ve spent enough time together that she’s gotten a feel for your views and tastes, and now she wants your input. [6] X Research source Sure, it doesn’t guarantee that her intentions are romantic, but it’s a good sign that the two of you have grown close enough that she trusts your judgement, which is a big step. If she’s asking relationship or dating advice, now’s your chance to find an in. Turn the tables and ask her advice on how she’d approach asking out someone she likes. “What would you do if you wanted to ask someone on a date but you weren’t sure if they liked you or not?”"
    },
    {
      "title": "Asking for help is a sign she feels close to you and might want to be closer.",
      "content": "Asking for help is a sign she feels close to you and might want to be closer. She wouldn’t ask just anyone for a hand, and asking you is a way to grab your attention and spend more time hanging out. [7] X Research source Of course, it depends on the context—if she’s asking for something that involves spending time with you, like picking her up from the airport, that’s a green light. If she’s asking you to pick up her friend from that airport, though, that’s probably just a platonic favor. Take her up on it, if you’ve got the time and feel comfortable doing so. Say, “For you? I can make it work.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "You’re close enough to be a confidant.",
      "content": "You’re close enough to be a confidant. Can you keep a secret? You won’t tell anyone, right? If you hear these, get ready, because you’re about to get closer—emotionally, at least. [8] X Research source Sometimes, the question precedes something big, like, “I’m into you.” Other times, she might just be filling you in on the newest gossip. In either case, she’s deemed you worthy of some down-low deets. If she’s revealing her feelings for you, say something like, “That’s funny, I’ve got the same secret.” If it’s something serious, keep that secret —don’t take advantage of her trust."

    {
      "title": "A girl who’s into you wants to know all about you.",
      "content": "A girl who’s into you wants to know all about you. She’ll ask about your hobbies, how you spend your free time, what sort of movies or books you like. She’s getting a feel for your vibe and your daily life. It might be because she’s trying to picture doing those things alongside you. [9] X Research source Things are casual right now, but could get serious if the conversation goes well. Be sure to ask her about her own interests while you talk to her . Girls are into guys who are interesting—and interested. Offer to lend her books or other hobby items as an excuse to talk to her again.

      "title": "She wants to know more about you on a deeper level.",
      "content": "She wants to know more about you on a deeper level. Beyond hobbies or casual interests, she wants to know what gets you out of bed in the morning. Passion projects, life pursuits, areas of study. It’s a way to find out what moves you, and if those things move her, as well, then you’ve got chemistry. [10] X Research source Even if she’s not totally into those things, a guy who’s got passions is a guy who can be passionate about a girl, and that’s attractive! Go ahead and gush about what gets you excited. Passion is infectious, and expressing yourself is the best way to find a genuine connection. Of course, turn the question back to her, and listen actively and ask plenty of follow-up questions. Showing that you’re into her passions also shows that you’re into her."

      "title": "She’s asking if there’s room for a partner in your long-term plans.",
      "content": "She’s asking if there’s room for a partner in your long-term plans. You wouldn’t want to get involved with someone who’s moving away next month, right? Or even someone who just doesn’t see romance in their future. She’s sussing out how you feel about a relationship by asking questions about your life as a whole, and about how with whom you anticipate spending your future. [11] X Research source Answer honestly, but remember to also mention something like, “I hope I can meet someone to share that life with,” to drop a hint that you’re available."

    {
      "title": "She’s asking for your star sign to see if you’re compatible.",
      "content": "She’s asking for your star sign to see if you’re compatible. Girls who are into astrology often open by asking for your chart. To many, this is a make-or-break question. It’s a roll of the dice, sure—she might write you off just because you were born in January—but you just might get lucky. [12] X Research source Go along with it, even if you don’t buy into astrology. It can still be a fun topic of conversation that leads to learning a bit more about her. Say, “What sign does my birthday make me? What’s that mean? How about you?”"

    {
      "title": "She wants to know if you’re politically compatible.",
      "content": "She wants to know if you’re politically compatible. General etiquette advises against coming right out and asking, “You! Who did you vote for?” Instead, she’ll take the long way around to finding out if your political compasses align, and if she could live with that if you entered a relationship. [13] X Research source There’s no point hiding your views and wasting both your time. You might see eye-to-eye, which is a green light. If you disagree, stay civil and ask her questions about her own views. Your differences might spark a lively conversation, which might also spark an attraction."
    },
    {
      "title": "She’s picturing herself as your partner interacting with your parents.",
      "content": "She’s picturing herself as your partner interacting with your parents. Some say that when you get married, you’re also marrying their parents. Your partner’s family plays a significant role in their lives, and it’s good to know what you’re getting into. [14] X Research source She’s trying to find out just that. Before she goes any further, she wants to know if she’ll get along with the other people in your life. If possible, invite her to find out! Offer to bring her to an upcoming wedding, family reunion, or even just a family dinner. You can keep it casual while also spending more time with her."

    {
      "title": "She’s trying to get a feel for your social circle.",
      "content": "She’s trying to get a feel for your social circle. After all, if you hit it off, she’ll be spending lots of time with the people you spend time with. It’s also an opportunity to see how you talk about other people, which might tell her more about you as a person. [15] X Research source That road goes both ways. Ask her about her own friends: what are they like? What do they do together? Who knows, you might have some mutual pals. She might also ask about your previous relationships to get a feel for the sort of romantic partner you are."
