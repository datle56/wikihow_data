      "content": "Wet your hair (or don't! ). Even if you're not interested in a methodical styling session, you can still use mousse to quickly and easily give your hair a more vibrant look. Wetting your hair is a good start, but it's not essential. As a general rule, the wetter your hair is when you use mousse, the shinier and \"wetter\" it will appear when you've finished styling. If you choose to wet your hair, wet your hair under the sink to ensure it's evenly wet, with no dry spots. If you really soak your hair, dry it lightly with a towel or allow it to air dry, ideally to a moderate level of wetness. Your hair should feel like you've just dried off from a shower. Mousse is a great choice for anyone who doesn't want to carry hair product with them throughout the day - all it takes is a spritz of water to reactivate mousse, allowing you to re-style your hair throughout the day. Mousse can also invigorate thinning hair."

      "content": "Dispense some mousse into your palm. As with any normal aerosol can, hold the can upright for the best results. Begin with a small amount; if you don't use enough, you can always reapply more later. Depending on the length and thickness of your hair, the amount will vary slightly. For medium length hair, try starting with an egg-sized amount. Using a lot of mouse can give your hair a shiny, slightly flat appearance. This is great if you're going for a \"slicked back\" look, but if you're trying to give your hair some lift, use mousse more sparingly."

      "content": "Work the mousse into your hair. Spread your mousse onto both hands. Then, brush your hands up through your hair from the front to the back. Pay special attention to your roots (the part of your hair near the base). Ensure the mousse is spread evenly through your hair, using your fingers or a wide-toothed comb to work the mousse so that your hair feels uniformly \"wet\" with mousse. You can also try \"teasing\" your hair at its roots with the tips of your fingers to get it to stand up. If you've got especially long hair, you may get better results taking a more methodical approach when applying mousse to your hair. Refer to the method above for tips."

      "title": "Dry your hair.",
      "content": "Dry your hair. Use a blow dryer set to \"low\" if you're going for an Ace Ventura-style lifted hairdo. Part your hair with a comb so that the blow dryer can reach your roots. On the other hand, if you want a more subdued hairdo, it's perfectly acceptable to allow your hair to air-dry and then style it with your hands. If you blow dry, your hairstyle will \"set\" more strongly than if you air dry. Air-dried hair can easily be re-styled throughout the day with your hands. Throw a quick style into your hair while it's drying. Most short hairdos only take a few easy hand motions to shape. Mousse is best for styles that don't require extreme hold — if you're looking for a foot-long mohawk, try again with gel or pomade. Here are a few easy styles you can make on your way out the door: Run your fingers back through your hair to give it a taller, fuller appearance. This volume-enhancing look can be especially useful for men who want to make the most of their thinning hair coverage. If you have thicker hair, form your hair into a rough peak at the middle of your head for an easy faux-hawk. If you have long bangs, try styling your hair to one side for a bold \"Flock of Seagulls\" look."

      "content": "Begin by wetting your hair. It should be damp to the touch all the way to the root, but it should not be dripping. Lightly wet your hair in the sink or the shower. If you accidentally get your hair sopping wet, no worries – just dry it lightly with a towel. Try leaving time after your shower for moussing. Your hair will already be wet, so you won't waste any extra water wetting it in the sink!"

      "content": "Apply the mousse to your roots in sections. Shake the can to agitate the mousse and hold it vertically when spraying. Section your hair and apply your mousse to the roots of each section, beginning at the nape of the neck and working up to the top of the head. Don't be afraid to spray the mousse directly from the can into the hair's roots – as long as you don't over-do it, mousse is barely noticeable when it dries. Spread the mousse evenly over the root area with a finger. If you're in a rush, simply flip your head over so that your hair hangs down and gently apply mousse to the roots this way, spreading it through the root area with your fingers. If you have plenty of time, be methodical with your hair sectioning and your mousse application. The more richly and evenly you apply your mousse, the more \"lift\" you'll be able to achieve."

If needed, add additional mousse to any ends that the mousse doesn't reach. Comb your hair with a wide-tooth comb or a gentle brush to help distribute the mousse."

      "content": "Blow dry your hair. As mousse dries, it will stiffen slightly, giving your hair more lift and strength. Use a blow dryer set to \"low\" to dry your hair, paying special attention to your roots. The more thoroughly you dry moussed hair roots, the stronger they'll support your hairstyle and the more \"lift\" you'll get. Try using a comb or brush to part your hair so that you can blow dry the roots directly. For extra lift, pull your hair at ninety degrees from the head with short, repeated strokes while you dry it. It will dry with a very full, bodied appearance. Alternatively, air dry your hair. Air drying won't give your hair as much volume, but it will give it a shiny, \"wet\" look. You can comb air-dried hair to ensure it's smooth and manageable without affecting its hold. If you have straightened hair, volumizing mousse will help it look fuller and give it more body."

Here are just a few ideas (feel free to mix and match): Make the most of mousse's volumizing properties by going for a lifted, \"tussled\" look. Add a few twists. Twist sections from the side of your head around a brush, heat it with a blow dryer, then allow it to cool. Unwind your hair and let it fall. Control curly, frizzy hair. If your hair reacts negatively to moisture, work a little mousse into your normal hair style to control your unruly curls."

      "content": "Identify your hair type. Hair comes in a variety of textures and thicknesses. Hair can be thick, thin, straight, wavy, kinky, curly, dry, oily or any combination of these qualities. Mousse should be suitable for almost all hair types, however, because of its relatively light \"hold,\" coarser, heavier hairs can be difficult to style with it. Here are some tips to guide your mousse usage if you have the following types of hair: Thin hair: Apply liberally to roots for added lift and volume. Oily hair: Shower before applying. Allow shampoo to sit in your hair for several minutes before rinsing. Thick, coarse, or curl hair: Consider applying a lightweight, relaxing balm to soften your hair and control any unruly frizz. Fine and/or dry hair: Use a conditioning mousse with extra hold. [1] X Research source"

Though an average, well-rounded mouse ought to suit nearly all hairdos, certain specially-formulated mousses offer advantages for a variety of hairstyles. Here are just a few types of mousse you'll encounter if you go shopping at your local hair salon or beauty supply store: Mousse with extra hold - for windy days or especially unruly hair. Conditioning mousse - for repairing and styling dry or damaged hair. Scented mousse - many mousses have delicious perfume scents added - choose the one that smells best to you.

Beat the whites with a whisk. At you beat the egg, air is forced into it, giving it a light, fluffy texture. Beat the whites until they're fluffy and form stiff peaks. Now, it's just a matter of styling your hair with the egg like you'd use normal mousse. Rub the mixture in your hair and let it dry briefly, then style to your heart's content! Don't worry - if you don't like your results or you're grossed out by having raw egg in your hair, homemade mousse washes out in the shower."
