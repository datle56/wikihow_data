In the eyes of the state, you and your partner are signing a contract that legally binds you for the rest of your life. To your friends and family, getting married is a public declaration of your love for and commitment to your partner.

Estate planning benefits, including inheritance rights, and government benefits like Social Security and disability benefits are all things that will be easier to receive once you’re married. You might also have better access to employment benefits, such as getting insurance through your spouse’s employer. [2] X Research source Spouses are protected under the law from disinheritance. In other words, your spouse automatically has the right to inherit your assets when you die simply because they’re married to you.

      "content": "Financial benefits Married couples generally have more assets than those who are divorced or have never been married. One study found that married Americans had more than twice the average assets of divorced people and those who had never been married. Married couples are also considered a single taxable unit, so you could end up paying less in taxes. [6] X Research source You could possibly receive a marriage bonus when you and your spouse file taxes with your newly combined income. This happens when one person’s income is significantly higher than their partner’s. [7] X Research source The tax brackets for married couples are much wider, so there’s a better chance that your combined income won’t put you in a higher tax bracket. In addition to this, married couples might be able to get some extra benefits when it comes to making big purchases. For example, married couples can combine their car insurance policies under just one insurance policy and pay lower premiums. [8] X Research source"

Being in a committed relationship has been linked to lower cortisol levels, and research has shown long-term partners are more likely to survive the first 3 months after surgery than single patients. [9] X Research source People in committed relationships are also more likely to lead healthier lifestyles since they have someone to cheer them on. This might be eating a healthier diet, exercising more, or refraining from smoking and drinking. Being in a loving relationship also gives many people a greater sense of purpose. A study also found that married men and women between the ages of 65 and 85 had a longer total life expectancy than unmarried men and women.

A stable family structure and income provides children with a nurturing environment to grow up in and more opportunities to pursue higher education. [11] X Research source For example, if both you and your future spouse are working, the combined income may allow you to move to a better school district, pay for more extracurricular activities, and fund your child’s college tuition. [12] X Research source People who decide to marry may also have a stronger commitment to raising children and may be more involved in their children’s lives. Married parents tend to have a more affectionate and consistent parenting style. [13] X Research source"

      "content": "High divorce rates In the United States, about 50% of marriages end in divorce. Demographic factors such as a person’s education or financial status have been shown to contribute greatly to this high divorce rate, but things like stress and a fear of commitment even after getting married are also major factors. [14] X Trustworthy Source American Psychological Association Leading scientific and professional organization of licensed psychologists Go to source When it comes to education, women who have earned at least a bachelor’s degree have a 78% chance of staying in their marriage for 20 years. On the other hand, that likelihood drops to 41% for women with only a high school diploma. A 2009 report from the University of Virginia's National Marriage Project estimated that a couple with no assets was 70% more likely to divorce within just 3 years compared to a couple that had $10,000 in assets. Some couples may be very happy and excited during that initial honeymoon phase. But that can quickly fizzle out as they become overwhelmed when they realize the realities of marriage and the long-term commitment they’ve signed themselves up for. [15] X Research source"

However, as more resources and opportunities become available to people, such as higher education and more advanced careers, a lot of young people are putting off marriage or rejecting it altogether. To some, marriage is no longer the sole means of succeeding and finding happiness in life. [16] X Research source Most Americans consider it acceptable for people who aren’t married to live together.

In fact, a 2005 survey found that 28.4% of people cited financial problems as their reason for divorce. [18] X Research source This includes things like having a partner who spends too much, not being able to make ends meet, having to take care of in-laws, and the costs of raising children. There is also a chance that you could actually pay more in taxes when you’re married compared to when you’re single. This is called a “marriage penalty,” and it usually applies to couples who earn similar incomes. [19] X Research source"

There are some cases where one of the couple’s family members disapproves of the marriage, which can cause a lot of stress and feelings of isolation or loneliness. It may even cause a rift to form between you and certain family members. [20] X Research source There’s also a chance that you and your in-laws may not see eye to eye on more sensitive topics like politics, religion, or cultural customs. Even though you might’ve just taken the big step of getting married, your in-laws might also put a lot of pressure on you and your spouse to do even more, such as buy a house and have kids."

      "content": "Loss of individuality This doesn’t mean that you completely lose your sense of self once you get married. However, you will have another person to take care of, and this may cause you to unconsciously put your own wants and needs on the back burner. [22] X Research source There are also some stereotypes and social expectations that come along with marriage, such as assigned gender roles within the household. These are all things that may cause you to lose a bit of your individuality after getting married. A way to make sure that you and your partner are both prioritizing your individuality is to establish healthy boundaries about things you want and don’t want in your relationship and marriage. For example, you might ask for shared responsibility when it comes to financial decisions, or equal division of household chores so it doesn’t all fall on one person. Another example would be establishing boundaries about setting aside time to pursue individual interests and hobbies."

This included the costs for things like the rent for the venue, the rings, a photographer, a videographer, catering, and flowers.

Take a moment to reflect on why you personally want to get married or stay in your current relationship with your partner. Then, ask your partner about their feelings regarding marriage. If you two aren’t seeing eye to eye, sit down and talk to one another about your different opinions. Instead of trying to convince one another to give in, do your best to compromise on a solution that will make you both happy. For example, maybe your partner doesn’t necessarily want to get married, but they’d be okay with having a commitment ceremony where you two can make your relationship official in front of your friends and family without legally binding yourselves to one another."

Instead of just thinking about right now, think about what your relationship will look like a year from now. Then take it further and think about 5, 10, and 15 years down the road. Can you see yourself living a happy and fulfilling life with your partner? Ask yourself if you think you and your partner are truly compatible. Look at your individual views on things like religion, politics, and culture. Do you have a lot in common, or do you tend to argue about most points?"

Ask things like: [24] X Trustworthy Source American Psychological Association Leading scientific and professional organization of licensed psychologists Go to source Will you have joint or separate bank accounts?

If not, it might be best to work on these things before rushing into getting married. [27] X Research source Your personal commitment to your marriage and your partner is extremely important.

However, if your partner struggles with any of these issues, are you well prepared to help them and deal with any stress that may come with such habits?
