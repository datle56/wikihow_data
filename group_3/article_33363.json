Make sure each letter rack is placed in front of 1 of the 4 sides on the board. [1] X Research source Give everyone a piece of paper and a pencil, too. That way, they can keep track of all their points. If your crew wants to be extra fancy, each player can bring their very own Scrabble score notebook ."

In this kind of situation, you’ll need to look up the word in a dictionary. Make sure everyone is on the same page about the dictionary you’ll use, then refer to it whenever challenges come up. Or, use the official “Word Checker for Scrabble®” app instead. Words that are always off limits include: [2] X Research source Proper nouns—nouns that are always capitalized—like names and places. Abbreviations, like “CIA,” “FBI,” or “USA.” Prefixes or suffixes by themselves, like “anti-” or “-ful.” Hyphenated words, like “short-term” or “old-fashioned.” Any other incomplete and unofficial English word, like “ridic” (for “ridiculous”)."

If you love creativity and showing off your vocabulary , then this is definitely the board game for you.

[6] X Research source Keep track of the points for each play! More on that in the Scoring section . The star counts as a “Premium Square,” and it doubles the score of the player who places their first word.

For a word to be valid, all tiles must be connected on the board. [9] X Research source Make sure to consider all the connected tiles. If you add tiles to someone else’s word on the board, the tiles must create 1 new word. However, if your tiles touch other tiles somewhere else on the board, these connections need to also make valid words for your play to count. For example, build the word “noisy” by using the \"n\" in another player’s word, “pension,” to connect all of the words."

[14] X Research source Example: If you lay down 5 letter tiles to spell the word \"aroma,\" and \"m\" is on a Triple Letter Bonus, while the entire word is on a Double Word Bonus, first calculate the bonus for the letter (3x2=6), factor it in when getting the score for the total word (1+1+1+6+1=10), then use the Triple Word Score to trip that sum (10x3=30) to arrive at your final score (30) for that turn."

[15] X Research source Example: If you lay down all 7 tiles to play the word “detainer,\" and both \"e\" and \"n\" are on Triple Letter Bonus Squares, factor in the bonuses for \"e\" (1x3=3) and \"n\" (1x3=3), total up the score whole word (1+3+1+1+1+3+1+1=12), then add your 50-point \"Bingo\" (12+50=62) to receive your final score for that turn (62)."

As the scorekeeper tallies everyone’s points, each player announces the points value (if any) of the tiles left over in their rack.

If a player tallied up 100 points, but they have 2 tiles left in their rack which have a combined points total of 9, then they’ll end the game with 91 points (100-9=91). If a super fortunate player ends the game with 0 tiles in their rack, then they get the sum of all other players’ unplayed tiles added to their score. If there were 3 other players, and they each had 5 points left in their racks, then the player with 0 tiles gets to add 15 points (5+5+5) to their total score. If there’s a tie, then the player with the highest score before any deductions wins. If Player A and Player B are tied with points, but Player A had 119 points before deducting 1 point and Player B had 120 points before deducting 2 points, then Player B wins."
