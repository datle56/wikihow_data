      "title": "Buy a plastic face mask.",
      "content": "Buy a plastic face mask. Choose a plain mask that covers your entire face. It can have eye holes, but the mouth needs to be closed. The mask can be colored, but it needs to have a smooth surface, with no texture of embellishments. You can find these sorts of masks in arts and crafts stores and party supply shops."

    {
      "title": "Place the face mask onto a sheet of thin cardboard.",
      "content": "Place the face mask onto a sheet of thin cardboard. The cardboard needs to be about 12 inches (30.5 centimeters) larger than the face mask on all sides. You need to have more room on the bottom of the cardboard than on the top."
    },
    {
      "title": "Draw the headdress around the face mask.",
      "content": "Draw the headdress around the face mask. Draw around the face mask first. Next, draw the shape of Tutankhamun's headdress around it. It curves above the forehead and dips down past your shoulders. [1] X Research source Look at reference pictures of Tutankhamun's death mask for this step."

    {
      "title": "Cut the headdress out.",
      "content": "Cut the headdress out. Begin by cutting out the entire headdress out first. Next, cut the gap between the shoulder pieces, then the inside oval."
    },
    {
      "title": "Secure the mask to the headdress.",
      "content": "Secure the mask to the headdress. Place the mask back on top of the headdress. Use small pieces of masking tape to secure the face mask to the cardboard. Flip the whole think over, and secure the back with more tape. [2] X Research source Alternatively, you can secure the mask to the headdress with hot glue."

    {
      "title": "Cut two semi-ovals for the ears.",
      "content": "Cut two semi-ovals for the ears. Cut an oval shape about the same size as your own ear out of cardboard or craft foam—the color does not matter. Cut the oval in half to make two ears."
    },
    {
      "title": "Secure the ears to the mask.",
      "content": "Secure the ears to the mask. The ears near to be between the nose and eyes, with the straight edge should be facing the front, and the curved edge against the headdress. For a more realistic mask, tape the ears at a slight angle to the mask, so that the straight edge is touching the side of the mask, and the curved edge is touching the headdress. You can use hot glue for this step as well. Make sure that you use masking tape for this."

      "title": "Glue a thin strip of craft foam for the crown base.",
      "content": "Glue a thin strip of craft foam for the crown base. Cut a 1-inch (2.5-centimeter) wide strip of craft foam, long enough to go across the forehead, from one edge of the mask to the other. Secure the strip to the forehead using masking tape or hot glue. The strip should be level with the tops of the ears."

      "content": "Sculpt a cobra and an vulture head out of paper clay. Look at reference pictures of Tutankhamun's mask for these. Start with a coil of clay for each, then twist the coils into a rough S-shape. Use your fingers to pinch a beak for the vulture, and a hood for the cobra. Add eyes using a toothpick, pen, pencil, or any other pointy object. Let the pieces dry. Make these about the same height as the nose, with the cobra being taller than the vulture."

      "content": "Tear newspaper into thin strips. It is better if you tear the newspaper rather than cut it; the ragged edges will blend in together much better. Plan on making the strips between ½ and 1 inch (1.25 and 2.5 centimeters) wide and 2 to 3 inches (5 to 3.75 centimeters) long. Try to have different sizes. This will help you fill in all those curves and angles. If you don't have newspaper, you can use blank newsprint, tissue paper, gauze strips, or even paper towels. [6] X Research source"

Apply them to the rest of the mask next, including the headdress and beard. [9] X Research source Use your fingers to smooth the paper mache down, and apply no more than 2 to 3 layers. [10] X Research source Run the strip over the edge of the bowl to get rid of any excess glue. Work one strip at a time. Don't soak all of the strips all at once. Your second layers may not need any glue; the glue from the previous layer may be enough to make them stick."

      "title": "Let the mask dry overnight, then paint it white.",
      "content": "Let the mask dry overnight, then paint it white. This will give you a smooth base to paint on, and make the paint show up better. If you want a smoother finish, you can paint it with white gesso, then sand it lightly with a fine-grit sanding sponge. You may have to do the gesso and sanding step a few times to achieve a smooth finish. You can also use spray paint primer instead."

The strips need to be horizontal on the shoulder parts, and vertical at the top, above the forehead.

You can use the same color as you did for the blue stripes on the headdress, but a pale blue or turquoise would be more accurate. For a even more accurate mask, leave the bottom of the beard gold.

Make them follow the curve of the eyes and stop at the end of the kohl."
