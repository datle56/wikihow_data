      "content": "Place a piece of tracing paper or regular paper over the photo recess. The inside of the locket should have a slight recess meant to hold the photo in place. Lay a piece of tracing paper over the locket so you can see the recessed part through the paper. If you don't have tracing paper, you can use tissue paper or any thin paper you can see through. Some lockets have a recess on both sides, so it can hold two photos, while others just have it on one side."

This method is best used for a locket that lies flat when it is open. If your locket's hinge won't allow it to lie flat, you won't be able to make a good copy. If you have a scanner and printer at home, that will work just as well."

Since you'll be getting ink or paint directly on the locket, there's a possibility that it could get damaged. You may want to test the ink or paint in an inconspicuous spot, like the inside of the locket. Put a dab in the center of the locket and see if it easily wipes off with a damp cloth.
