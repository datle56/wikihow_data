Be careful not to get it too close to the fret or you'll get a lot of buzzing. [2] X Research source Sometimes beginner guitarists use a capo to \"cheat\" their way to simpler chord shapes, but in this case, it's not a cheat—that's how Noel Gallagher originally played it."

All the other chords that you make for this song come from changing the position of your 1st and 2nd fingers. This is referred to as a \"pedal point\" or just a \"pedal,\" and it gives your playing a little more depth and harmony. [3] X Research source Pedal points are used in a lot of rock and pop songs. The technique has been around since Bach—once you know it, you'll start hearing it everywhere."

Make sure your 3rd and 4th fingers are sitting where they're supposed to be on the 2nd fret of the 1st and 2nd strings. Now strum all of the strings—that's Em7 , the 1st chord of the song.

Remember to keep your 3rd and 4th fingers where they are as well! Strum all of the strings a couple of times—you have a G , the 2nd chord in the song.

That's convenient because A7sus4 is the last chord in the main chord progression for the song, so you'll be hopping right back to Em7 after this chord when you're playing the song. [4] X Research source Now you have the whole chord progression for the verses, starting with Em7. Play 2 strums of Em7, 2 strums of G, 2 strums of Dsus4, 2 strums of A7sus4, then back around to Em7. Keep playing this progression until the chord changes become automatic. You can probably hear the verses in your head now—this is starting to sound like the actual song!"

This transition only happens once during each chorus, but it's probably the toughest part of the song in terms of chord transitions because it happens in a single beat. Practice going back and forth between G and F# with only one strum for each chord. Start slow, then gradually speed up until you've developed the muscle memory. You've got this!"

Now, get your strumming hand moving up and down over the strings in a regular rhythm, almost like a metronome. The key to the strum pattern for this song is to keep your strumming hand moving up and down all the time , even if you're not actually strumming the strings. This will help you keep time so the rhythm stays consistent."
