[2] X Research source Just run your pot, pan, or baking sheet under water and shake off the excess moisture. Then, apply a thin layer of baking soda to the inside, sides, and bottom of your cookware where you see rust. [3] X Research source Wetting your cookware helps the baking soda stick to your pot or pan and create a paste. Baking soda removes rust on non-stick, stainless steel, cast-iron, and other metal pots, pans, cookware, and baking sheets."

Just set a timer for 30 minutes and leave your pot, pan, or baking sheet be. [4] X Research source For extra cleaning power, pour a little bit of white vinegar onto the baking soda. This creates a bubbling reaction that helps dissolve the rust. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Scrub the baking soda and rust with a scrubbing sponge. Take a scrubbing sponge or scouring pad and rub it into the baking soda and rusty spots using circular motions. If you’re dealing with a lot of rust, use firm pressure and some elbow grease to remove the spots. [6] X Research source For cast-iron cookware : Scrub with steel wool if you’re dealing with severe rust. Do not use steel wool on stainless steel or non-stick pots and pans, as it can scratch and damage the metal. Instead, stick to a sponge or toothbrush. Or, scrub with a potato. Potatoes contain oxalic acid to help dissolve rust. Just cut any potato in half and rub the cut end into the baking soda and rust. [7] X Research source"

Then, dry your cookware with a clean kitchen towel. [8] X Research source If you still see spots of rust after rinsing off your pot or pan, repeat the steps above to remove the rest of the rust. For cast-iron : Rinse the pan under water without soap. Dry it on the stove over medium-low heat. Then, season your pan by pouring a dollop of vegetable oil into the pan and rubbing it into the inside, sides, and bottom with a paper towel. Then, heat your pan in the oven for 1 hour at 350 F (177° C). [9] X Research source"

Whether you’re cooking in a cast-iron skillet or a stainless steel pot, make sure to remove leftover food and oil from your cookware before storing it away. Regular cleaning prevents buildup that can lead to rust and extends the life of your pots and pans. Clean cast-iron by rinsing your cookware under water and scraping off any food residue with a scrubbing pad or sponge. Wash other metal pots and pans, like stainless steel, with dish soap and warm water. Use a scrubbing pad or sponge to scrub and remove old bits of food.
