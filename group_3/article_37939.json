    {
      "title": "Make sure you have a weapon.",
      "content": "Make sure you have a weapon. A diamond sword is highly recommended. Wooden or stone tools are not. Bring a couple of buckets of water as well, since Endermen take damage from water."
    },
    {
      "title": "Find an Enderman.",
      "content": "Find an Enderman. Do not , however, look in the eyes. This makes it teleport away and just completely rage, and it could get the first hit. Hit him first."
    },
    {
      "title": "Hide in a tree if one is close by.",
      "content": "Hide in a tree if one is close by. It is likely, however, that there most likely will not be one. Then, make sure leaves or a block covers the Enderman's head. Hit him in the feet. He will not teleport."
    },
    {
      "title": "Hit its feet.",
      "content": "Hit its feet. Endermen are less likely to teleport away if you are hitting their feet (the bottom of their legs)."
    },
    {
      "title": "Eat before you go to the Enderman.",
      "content": "Eat before you go to the Enderman. You should fill your hunger bars. Full hunger bars, or 90% full or more, will heal you slowly."
    },
    {
      "title": "Heal before you go to the Enderman.",
      "content": "Heal before you go to the Enderman. Make sure you have full hearts."
    },
    {
      "title": "Wear good armour.",
      "content": "Wear good armour. Diamond is recommended."
    },
    {
      "title": "Bring food.",
      "content": "Bring food. You might lose some hunger bars."
    },
    {
      "title": "Make sure you brought a sword/armour that hasn't been too used.",
      "content": "Make sure you brought a sword/armour that hasn't been too used. It could run out. You could instead bring multiple damaged armour/swords, if you have them."
    },
    {
      "title": "Hide under cobblestone blocks.",
      "content": "Hide under cobblestone blocks. Put cobblestone right above your head, as low as possible. Like #3, but this is better because, well, trees don't spawn everywhere you want 'em to. Cobblestone is highly recommended, because Endermen cannot take cobblestone and cobblestone is probably the easiest block to get that they will not take. These basic blocks they will pick up: Grass block, dirt, and sand. They even pick up gold blocks, diamond blocks, iron, melon blocks, pumpkins, TNT, clay, gravel, glass blocks/panes, stained glass blocks/panes, red sand, podzol and gravel."

    {
      "title": "Bring a buddy to help you fight.",
      "content": "Bring a buddy to help you fight. A buddy will make it much easier to kill mobs. Note: If you have your friend (or even brother/sister/relative) in your house, open to LAN by doing this: In your single player world, press Esc on your keyboard > Open to LAN > Start LAN World. Your friend/relative must be on a computer linked to your computer's network."

    {
      "title": "Use water to take a break from combat.",
      "content": "Use water to take a break from combat. If the Enderman proves to be more than match, place the water from the bucket right next to you or the Enderman, then quickly hop into the water. If the Enderman tries to enter the water, it will take damage,then teleport away."

    {
      "title": "Trap the Enderman.",
      "content": "Trap the Enderman. If you make the Enderman walk up to a boat, then it will become trapped in the boat and be unable to teleport. This way, you can kill it safely."
