      "content": "Find an indoor or outdoor regulation netball court. [1] X Research source It measures 100 feet (30.5 meters) long and 50 feet (15.25 m) wide. The court has horizontal lines dividing it into thirds. There is a circle 3 feet (0.9 m) in diameter in the center of the court. There are 2 goal semicircles, each with a radius of 16 feet (4.9 m) at each end. The 15-inch-wide (38 cm) goal ring extends horizontally from a 10-foot (3 m) post located at the midpoint of each goal line. Not only is the hoop smaller than basketball, there's no backboard. If you're playing in your backyard try to set up a field of this general size. If you happen to be playing with only a few players, you can just do a timed competition. For example, a partnership can do 5 passes and 2 shots. Using a basketball is okay if you don't have a netball. The nets are pretty important, however, if you want to play the game properly, as it has a backboard and a much bigger ring. A basketball, however, is much larger and heavier than a netball, so there would be some other differences."

      "title": "Assign positions to the players.",
      "content": "Assign positions to the players. Only 2 players, identified by the insignia GS (Goal Shooter) and GA (Goal Attack), can score. The other 5 positions are Goalkeeper (GK), Goal Defense (GD), Wing Attack (WA), Wing Defense (WD) and Center (C). These identification letters are displayed on the front and back of each player's jersey. [2] X Research source The center stands in the small circle in the center of the court. The center is both an attacker and defender because they are in the middle. They are allowed anywhere on the court other than the goal circles. The center circle has a diameter of ten yards. The wing attack position tries to feed the ball to the goal shooters. They are positioned at the top third of the field toward the opponent’s goal. The wing attack position is not allowed in the goal circle. Wing defenders defend against the wing attack position, trying to keep the ball out of their third of the court. Wing defenders are allowed in the center third and their own third, but not the goal circle. The goal attack position is allowed to shoot the ball at the goal and also pass it to the goal shooters in the goal circle. These players are allowed in the center third, the opponents third, and the goal circle. The goal defense position defends against the goal attack position. They are allowed in all the same areas as the goal attack position. The goal shoot position is only allowed in the opposing team's goal circle and the opponent's third. Their job is to catch passes from their other two attacking teammates and try to shoot on the goal. The goal keeper is only allowed in their own goal circle and their own defending third. They must stop the other players from getting the ball and shooting on the goal."

      "content": "Do not move at all with the ball. You cannot dribble, only pivot with the foot you land on first. The number one rule of netball is that you cannot travel with the ball. Although the game has some similarities to basketball, this rule is more like ultimate Frisbee. Basically, once you have the ball you can only pivot. You must always keep one foot in the same place.

      "content": "Stand one metre away from the player with the ball if you are a defender. You cannot be closer than one metre than the player, but you can be as far away as you want. Standing too close is an example of an obstruction. You can’t get in another player's face, and you have to give them room to survey the floor. You can jump up and down once and defend the pass, but you have to give them room to throw. [4] X Research source This means that you cannot snatch or grab the ball out of another player's hands. You can intercept the ball in the air, but if someone has control of the ball you must keep your distance."

      "title": "Follow the three-second ball possession rule.",
      "content": "Follow the three-second ball possession rule. You are not allowed to hold the ball for more than three seconds at a time. Dropping the ball and picking it up again does not reset the possession clock. Similarly, if you try to pass to someone and miss and you grab the ball again the possession clock still does not end. If you hold the ball for more than three seconds you must give it up to the other team. In High-5 netball, the ball can be held for 4 seconds and the GS and GK can go in 2 thirds, the centre third and the one with the oppositions goal/ your goal."

If it lands on what they called, they get the ball. You can also do a throw up. A player from each team stands opposite each other, facing the way they are shooting, a metre away from each other in the centre circle. The coach or Umpire then tosses the ball up in between them and the first one to catch the ball decides whether they want the first center pass, or they can choose which way they want to shoot.

Major rules prohibit contact (accidental or deliberate), obstructing play, and intimidating your opponents. Should someone break a major rule, the offending player has to stand out of play while the other team throws a pass or shot from where the offense occurred. [8] X Research source Minor rules prohibit holding the ball for more than 3 seconds, stepping while in possession of the ball, moving out of the designated area for the position (offsides) or throwing the ball over a third of the court. Should an infringement on a minor rule occur, the other team gets a free pass from where the offense occurred."
