      "content": "Give your cactus more water if it’s wilting. If parts of the cactus appear shrunken, wrinkled, or wilted (drooping or appearing limp), it probably needs more water. If the soil is fully dry, water it thoroughly . Keep pouring water into the soil until it is fully soaked and the excess water starts to drain out the bottom of the pot. [1] X Research source To test if the soil is dry, stick your finger about 2 inches (5 cm) deep into the soil. If the soil feels dry, it’s time to water your cactus. Lift your cactus’ pot to see if it needs water. Xoch says another sign that your plant is underwatered is that the “pot is going to be very light.” Cacti prefer a deep, thorough drink that gets the soil saturated instead of shallow sprinkles of water. Shallow waterings can cause the soil to dry and harden, preventing your cactus from getting the water it needs. It can also cause cacti to grow crooked."

      "content": "Allow a droopy cactus to dry out and cut away any rotting parts. If your cactus is getting too much water, it may appear droopy and soft. Swett says any brown, yellow, or black segments on your cactus, especially when they’re near the base, can be a sign that your cactus is rotting due to overwatering. Use a sharp, sterilized knife or pair of shears to cut away any rotting spots. Then, let the soil dry completely before watering it again. If the cactus is very rotted , remove the plant from the soil and repot it in a clay container with drainage holes. Fill the pot with 1 part garden soil , 1 part coarse sand , and 1 part peat , or use a cactus potting mix . [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Give more light to a cactus that’s narrowing. If your cactus’ stems are narrowing, growing pointy, or getting stringy, it might be a sign that it has a condition called etiolation. [3] X Research source Insufficient sunlight is usually the cause of etiolation, so find a spot in your home or outside that gets 6 to 12 hours of sunlight each day. A southern-facing or western-facing window is a great choice for cacti. [4] X Research source Your cactus may also appear pale if it isn’t getting enough sun. If you don’t have a sufficiently sunny spot, place a grow light 6 to 12 inches (15 to 30 cm) above your cactus and keep it on for 14 to 16 hours each day. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Provide your cactus with less light if it’s turning yellow or brown.",
      "content": "Provide your cactus with less light if it’s turning yellow or brown. Swett says your cactus might be getting too much light if parts of the sun-facing side are “turning yellow” or brownish. Simply move it to a spot where it gets less direct sunlight and more shade. For instance, place it in an eastern-facing window, which gets gentle indirect sunlight. Wait to see how the cactus responds to its new shadier location. If the yellowed segments don’t improve in a few weeks, Swett suggests cutting them off to the healthy, green areas."

      "title": "Treat pests with rubbing alcohol or insecticidal soap.",
      "content": "Treat pests with rubbing alcohol or insecticidal soap . The main pests that damage cacti are mealybugs and spider mites. Mealybugs are tiny, powdery white, and appear in clusters. Spider mites are red, also quite small, and spin sheet-like webs between the cactus’s spines. To remove both of these pests, apply rubbing alcohol directly to the infested areas with a cotton swab. Or, spray the infected areas with insecticidal soap. [6] X Research source Both mealybugs and spider mites suck sap out of the cactus, causing it to look discolored, wilted, and damaged. They can also cause your cactus to grow more slowly."

      "title": "Move your cactus to a warmer spot if the temperatures are freezing.",
      "content": "Move your cactus to a warmer spot if the temperatures are freezing. Most cacti are warm-weather plants that don’t tolerate frost or freezing temperatures well. When they go dormant in the winter, they prefer temperatures around 45 to 55° F (7-13° C). [7] X Research source If your cactus is exposed to freezing temperatures below this range, move it inside or cover it with a sheet or blanket. [8] X Research source In the winter, move your cactus next to a window or cool room, like a basement or garage, so it feels the cooler temperatures. This helps encourage it to bloom and grow more in the spring. Just make sure to keep your cactus out of the way of drafts—drafty windows and doors can expose your plant to too much cold. Cacti prefer temperatures around 65 to 85° F (18-29° C) during the growing season in the spring and summer. Unless you have a cold-hardy cactus, be careful not to let the room temperature drop below freezing, since most cacti can’t tolerate frost."

      "content": "Clean your cactus if it’s covered in dust and dirt. If the skin of your cactus is dusty or dirty, it may not be able to photosynthesize properly. This can cause it to wilt and start to die. Simply dampen a soft cloth or sponge with water and wipe down the cactus’ stems. Or, rinse your plant under your sink or shower or with a hose. [9] X Research source Wear gloves and work carefully to avoid being poked by the cactus’ spines."

      "content": "Plant your cactus in a well-draining pot using well-draining soil. Most cacti are native to the desert, so they don’t like sitting in water. Make sure you plant your cactus in a pot that has drainage holes and fill it with well-draining soil. For instance, use a cactus soil mix or make your own mix out of 1 part garden soil , 1 part coarse sand , and 1 part peat . [10] X Research source Plant your cactus in a clay pot as well—their heaviness helps keep bulkier cacti from tipping over. They also allow the soil to breathe and dry out, which helps prevent the roots from rotting. [11] X Research source If you’re growing cacti in the ground, ensure the spot where you plant them doesn’t pool water."

      "content": "Water your cactus only when the soil is dry. Test the moisture level by pressing your finger 2 inches (5 cm) deep into the soil. If it is completely dry, water the cactus’ soil fully, waiting until the water starts to drain out the hole in the bottom of the pot. Alternatively, water your cactus from the roots. Fill a tray or saucer with a few inches of water and place the pot inside. Then, remove the pot once the soil feels moist at the top. [12] X Research source"

      "title": "Give your cactus more water in the spring/summer than in the fall/winter.",
      "content": "Give your cactus more water in the spring/summer than in the fall/winter. Cacti need different amounts of water depending on whether they’re growing or dormant. During the growing season of March to September, water them every 1 to 2 weeks. During the dormant season of October to February, water only once per month, at the most. In both seasons, only water your cactus when the soil is completely dry. Watering too much during the dormant season is the main cause of complications with cacti. In general, plants need less water during their dormant season (fall/winter) and more during their growing season (spring/summer). Swett says “if you're diminishing the light, you want to diminish the volume of water” and if you’re “increasing the light, you're going to want to increase the volume of water.” In other words, “you definitely want to cut back in the winter and increase in the summer.”"

In the summer, keep your cactus in a sunny window or outdoors—just be careful not to let it get too much rain. In the winter, place your cactus in a southern- or western-facing window, which has the brightest and longest sun exposure. [13] X Research source When moving your cactus to a sunnier spot, start it in a shady area at first. Then, gradually move it to the sunnier area to avoid sunburn."

      "content": "Apply a low-nitrogen fertilizer monthly during the growing season. To grow big and healthy, cacti need regular feeding during the growing season (March to September). About once per month, apply a water-soluble or granular fertilizer that’s lower in nitrogen, such as a 5-10-5 or 10-30-20 fertilizer . [14] X Research source Too much nitrogen gives the cactus a flabby texture that can impede its growth. [15] X Research source Never fertilize a cactus during the dormant season (October to February), as this can harm the plant and hinder growth. [16] X Research source Follow the manufacturer’s directions on the package to apply the fertilizer properly. Most fertilizers are labeled with a ratio that indicates how much nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium they contain (in the form: N-Ph.-Po.)"

      "content": "Repot your cactus when it grows too big for its pot. You’ll know it’s time to transplant your cactus to a larger pot when it becomes too top-heavy for the pot, when it grows within 1 inch (2.5 cm) of the edge, or when you see roots at the bottom of the pot. Simply wear a pair of gloves and carefully lift the cactus out of the pot. Then, plant it in a pot that’s 1 inch (2.5 cm) larger than the old one using well-draining soil. [17] X Research source Replant the cactus at the same level in the soil as it was in the original pot. In general, cacti need to be repotted every 1 to 2 years. Aim to repot your cactus in the early spring before it starts putting out new growth. Warning : Wait to water newly potted cacti 1 week after repotting them. The roots can get damaged during the repotting process, so waiting to water them helps prevent the roots from getting further damaged."

      "title": "Cut away dead roots when you repot your cactus.",
      "content": "Cut away dead roots when you repot your cactus. A common result of over-watering is root rot, which happens when roots sit for too long in poorly drained, moist soil. When you repot your cactus, gently brush away the soil from the roots. Then, inspect them for any soft and mushy black roots. Simply use a pair of sterilized scissors or shears to cut away the rotted roots. [18] X Trustworthy Source University of Georgia Cooperative Extension Division of the University of Georgia focused on research and community education Go to source Cut the roots up to the part of the root that is still living. Healthy, living roots are a whitish-tan color and plump-looking. Remove any dried-up roots that appear dead, too. Avoid root rot by making sure the pot has a hole in the bottom for drainage and that it never sits in excess water that collects in a saucer underneath the pot. To help ensure your cactus thrives, let it sit for about 10 days out of its soil before repotting it. This can give it time to form calluses around the damaged or cut areas. Simply place it on a piece of paper out of the sun but away from cool temperatures."
