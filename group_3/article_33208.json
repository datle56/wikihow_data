      "title": "Gather your jacks and a ball.",
      "content": "Gather your jacks and a ball. All you need is a small bouncy ball and a set of jacks, which are six-pronged metal pieces. The number of jacks you need depends on which variation of the game you're playing, though most sets will have ten jacks. Jacks sets, which include a ball, a set of jacks, and a pouch to hold them in, can be found at most toy stores. The ancient form of jacks was called knucklebones, because instead of today's modern metal jacks, the knucklebones of sheep or goats were used."

      "title": "Play on a hard surface.",
      "content": "Play on a hard surface. Jacks requires a hard, flat, smooth surface for the ball to bounce on. If you're playing outdoors, a wooden porch or a paved surface like a sidewalk or a blacktop is ideal. If you're playing indoors, a hardwood or a linoleum floor works best. It's possible to play on a table, but standing is better than sitting in a chair, because it gives you more mobility."

    {
      "title": "Gather your players if desired.",
      "content": "Gather your players if desired. While it’s possible to play jacks by yourself, it’s more fun to play with an opponent. Jacks is usually played one on one, but you can have more players for a more fun game. There is no hard rule concerning the maximum amount of players, but keep in mind the game will last longer the more players there are. You can play in teams of two for games with six or more players."

      "title": "Decide who goes first.",
      "content": "Decide who goes first. The most traditional way is called flipping. Place the jacks in your two cupped hands, throw them into the air, and then catch as many as you can on the backs of your two hands, linked together with your thumbs. Toss them back in the air, and then catch as many as you can again, this time with your palms cupped again. The player who catches the most jacks goes first. [1] X Research source You can use a simpler method to decide who goes first, such as flipping a coin or playing rock paper scissors."

      "title": "Scatter the jacks onto the playing surface.",
      "content": "Scatter the jacks onto the playing surface. Whoever goes first throws the jacks directly in front of them. Try to scatter them evenly, not too close together and not too far apart. [2] X Research source If two jacks are touching, you can pick them up and throw them again to scatter them. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Toss the ball into the air.",
      "content": "Toss the ball into the air. Throw the ball straight up, giving it enough height to give you time to pick up your jacks but not so high that it veers off beyond your reach. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Let the ball bounce once and catch it.",
      "content": "Let the ball bounce once and catch it. The ball can only bounce one time - if you let it bounce more than once, your turn is over. Use the same hand you used to pick up the jack to catch the ball. The jack must stay in your hand while you grab the ball. Once you've caught the ball, transfer the jack to your opposite hand."

Transfer the jack to your other hand and repeat the process until you’ve scooped up each jack one at a time or you foul. This first round is called \"onesies.\" The jacks you’ve collected needs to stay in your hand as you scoop up another."

When your turn ends, return any jacks you picked up, scattering them. Pass the ball to the next player. There are a number of different ways to foul. Missing the ball, or letting it bounce more than once. Failing to pick up the correct number of jacks. Picking up the wrong number of jacks. Dropping a jack that you've picked up. Accidentally moving a jack from its placement on the ground (this is called \"tipping\"). [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Continue on to the next rounds. After picking up all jacks one by one, scatter them again. Follow the same sequence, throwing the ball, picking up jacks and catching the ball. Only this time pick up two jacks each time. This is called the \"twosies\" round. After all jacks have been picked up in twos, pick up three each round, then four, then five, and on to ten."

      "content": "Pick up where you left off. When your turn is reached again, start from where you were before your foul. For example, if you fouled during the “twosies” round, you would start your turn by throwing the ball and picking up two jacks. If you succeed, you keep going until you’ve picked up all the jacks in twos, then move on to the “threesies” round."
