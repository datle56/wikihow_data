The fabric rests differently on your body than it does against a flat surface. When you’re wearing the shirt, you’ll be able to make sure the bib feels comfortable against you. [1] X Expert Source Clare Flanagan Former Competitive Runner Expert Interview. 14 January 2019. If your race bib has tear-off tickets at the bottom (like a ticket for a free post-race beer or another perk), remove these before you put your bib on."

      "content": "Crumple the bib for a smooth fit, if race rules allow it. A crumpled bib will conform to your body better than a flat one, thus decreasing air resistance. However, if there's a chip on the bib or it's against race rules, try to keep it flat and smooth. Crumpling a bib can damage the chip and interfere with the recording of your time.

      "title": "Center the bib on the front of your shirt under your chest muscles.",
      "content": "Center the bib on the front of your shirt under your chest muscles. Generally, the bib should go right below your chest. Set it in the middle of your body and straighten it out as you pin it in place. Do your best to flatten it against you. This ensures the bib is visible to onlookers and doesn’t get in the way of your arms and legs. [3] X Research source Move your bib if race organizers direct you to do so. Some race organizers have different requirements for bib placement. For instance, some cyclists have one or more bibs attached to the back of their jerseys. Ask the race organizers for advice on bib placement if you’re unsure where it should go. Even if the bib is on your thigh, it should be visible and centered on the front of your pants."

      "title": "Secure one of the top corners of the bib with a safety pin.",
      "content": "Secure one of the top corners of the bib with a safety pin. Start at one of the top corners of the bib. Open up the safety pin and push the point through the bib fabric. Next, pass the point through your shirt and back out again. Finish by pushing the point back through the bib and securing it to the safety head. [4] X Research source Some bibs have holes in the corners. Push the pin through these if they are available. Make sure you're careful when using safety pins. Always pull the shirt away from your body with a safety pin before piercing the fabric!"

      "title": "Pin down the remaining corners.",
      "content": "Pin down the remaining corners. You’ll need at least four pins total in order to secure the pin (otherwise, it’ll flap around as you run). Repeat the pinning process for each corner. Your bib should feel flat and secure against your body. When you move, it should stay still. Add more pins or redo your pinning as needed."

      "title": "Pin your bib to the front of your shirt, centered below your chest.",
      "content": "Pin your bib to the front of your shirt, centered below your chest. The goal is to make your bib as visible as possible to race officials, photographers, and onlookers cheering you on. How high or low you place it on your chest or stomach is up to you and what feels comfortable to you—just make sure it’s relatively centered and on your front (not your back). [5] X Research source Alternatively, some racers pin their bib to the front of their running shorts (usually with the top edge pinned to the waistband) so they can remove layers if they get hot. Check with the race officials to make sure this is within the rules before you start your race! Some runners find pinning the bib to their shorts uncomfortable or distracting, so go for a test run with your bib on before race day to try it out. Try leaving one of the bottom corners unpinned for more freedom of movement."

      "content": "Race clips To avoid poking holes in your clothes with safety pins, some racers began using race clips . Some clips have plastic backs that secure the bib corner and your shirt together. Others have magnets that hold the bibs in place. They’re more expensive than safety pins, but they may be more comfortable for you. [6] X Research source Look online to order these or check a running shop near you."

Pull off the tape backing and stick the tape to your clothing. You’ll be able to wear a shirt you like without poking holes in it. [7] X Research source Ordinary tape won’t secure your bib enough. However, you can place electrical tape over pins for extra security. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Race belt with toggles Race bib toggles can also be ordered online. You’ll need to wear a race belt on your waist and hang the bib from it. Attach the toggle to your pack, then slip the toggle cord into the bib hole. Wrap the cord back up to the pack to fasten it inside the toggle. Repeat this by securing the other side with a toggle. [9] X Research source The bib hangs from toggles in the top two holes. It’ll be secure, but the bottom part staying loose can be a distraction. Electrical tape or pins can be used to hold it down. Using toggles may require you to attach the bib to your thigh or a location other than your abdomen. Consult the rules or race officials to make sure this is legal!"

      "title": "A running bib is identification for individual competitors in a race.",
      "content": "A running bib is identification for individual competitors in a race. The bib is typically a small rectangle or square of Tyvek (a tough, paper-like material that is waterproof and tear-proof) with a unique bib number on it to identify individual runners. The bib may also display identification info like your name, division, and shirt size as well as race sponsor logos, the corral where you start the race, and any other information that race officials need to know at a glance. [10] X Research source Runners aren’t the only athletes who use bibs when they compete. Cyclists, triathletes, gymnasts, and more may wear them too."

      "content": "Race bibs identify and track racers, but serve many other purposes too. Your bib and bib number are your personal identification for the race. With many races bringing in hundreds or thousands of competitors (and some major marathons bringing in over 40,000 racers!), bibs are a practical way for organizers to identify and keep track of competitors in a very large group of people. This helps accurately rank all racers as they finish, as well as provide quick identification in case of a medical emergency. However, that’s not all they’re good for! Race bibs and bib numbers also: Track individual runners and record their times with RFID (radio-frequency identification) chips that are detected at the start and finish mats (not all bibs have this feature). Give you access to the course and prove you’re a registered competitor (many race officials require you to wear your bib at all times before, during, and after the race). [11] X Research source Assign runners to a corral to keep the start of the race organized. Display race sponsor names and logos (which is often a source of revenue for race organizers). [12] X Research source Allow photographers and race organizers to snap your photo, identify you, and make sure you receive your photo. [13] X Research source Serve as a keepsake after your race. Allow your friends and family to spot you while they cheer you on and/or track your progress online (if your bib is chipped)."
