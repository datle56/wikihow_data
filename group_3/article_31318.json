The type of internet connection that's available depends on your location. The 3 main types of high-speed internet services are cable, DSL, and fiber optic: [2] X Research source Cable: Cable uses the existing cable television infrastructure to provide cable internet. Connect the coaxial cable that your cable internet service provider installed to the coaxial input on the back of the cable modem or gateway. DSL: DSL uses existing phone lines to provide high-speed internet. A DSL modem connects to the internet using a standard phone line. Connect a phone line from a phone jack to the DSL line on the back of the modem. Fiber optic: Fiber optic internet is the newest and fastest form of high-speed internet. The infrastructure for fiber optic is not available in all areas. Depending on how the service is installed at your home or business, a fiber optic cable may be installed by your internet service provider which you can connect directly to the modem, or it may be connected to a media converter which then connects to your modem or gateway device using an ethernet cable. Connect the ethernet cable to the internet or WAN port on the back of your router or gateway device."
