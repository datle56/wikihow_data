      "content": "Opt for hypoallergenic earrings made of platinum, titanium, and 14k gold. Nickel and cobalt allergies are common, so avoid these metals when you first get your ears pierced. Ask the piercer to help you pick out earrings to get the right metal. Typically, platinum, titanium, and 14K gold cause the least issues for sensitive ears. [1] X Research source Alternatively, surgical stainless steel earrings are typically your best bet for new piercings, as this metal is the least likely to cause an allergic reaction.

      "content": "Pick small ring or hoop earrings for easy cleaning and healing. Small hoops and rings are the ideal type of starter jewelry for lobe piercings and are typically easier to clean because they don't have earring backs that block your fresh piercing. Since slight swelling may occur after you get your ears pierced, these earrings won’t put any pressure on your healing piercing like studs sometimes can. There are 2 common types of rings/hoops: Ball closure rings are squeezed around a ball to stay in place. The ball has a tiny indent on each side for the ends of the ring to fit into. The pressure of the ring keeps the ball in place. Spring closure earrings are hoops or rings that open and close with a spring that snaps in and out of place. Open the spring to place the earring on your ear, and once the earring is on, close the spring. Get hoops or rings that are snug on your earlobe, as you won't want your piercing to move too much."

      "title": "Choose studs for your ear piercings to avoid snagging.",
      "content": "Choose studs for your ear piercings to avoid snagging. Studs are the most popular earrings for new piercings because they are small and cute. Many prefer studs because they don't get in the way and go with everything. Studs are fairly easy to clean but tend to get infected more easily than hoops because they have earring backs that can be tricky to clean. If you choose studs, take extra care when cleaning your piercings . Most commercial stores that offer piercings (like Claire's or Icing) use specialty studs when piercing ears. These studs usually have a sharp, pointed tip to make a clean piercing and a “safety” clutch backing. If you go to a store to get your ears pierced, pick an earring that doesn't catch on clothes. Avoid overly large studs, as this makes the piercing harder to clean."
