      "title": "Read the Bible verses aloud.",
      "content": "Read the Bible verses aloud. Listen to how the verses sound. Notice any words or terms that are repeated in the verses, as they are usually important. Think about what emotions or thoughts you have when you listen to the verses aloud. [1] X Research source You may also find it useful to listen to audio recordings of Bible verses. Many books in the Bible, such as the Letters from Paul, were originally read aloud to a congregation, rather than written down. Listening to audio recordings may deepen your understanding of the verses and experience them as they were originally intended. Look for audio recordings of the Bible at your local library or online."

      "title": "Identify the type of literature used in the verses.",
      "content": "Identify the type of literature used in the verses. There are several different types of literature in the books of the Bible, ranging from laws and rules to history, songs, proverbs, letters, and Gospels. There are also different types of literature in the verses themselves, such as prose, parables, prophecies, and genealogies. Identifying the literature used in the verses can help you better understand them. [2] X Research source For example, if you are reading verses that describe the details and events of Jesus’ birth in the book of Luke, you would be looking at prose. If you are reading verses that use poetic language and short phrases, you are likely reading poetry. You may also come across parables that describe a short scene and ask rhetorical questions or end with a clear lesson."

      "title": "Place the verses in the context of the rest of the passage.",
      "content": "Place the verses in the context of the rest of the passage. Look at the verses around the verses you are studying. Consider how the surrounding verses set up the verses you are looking at. Check for any information on who wrote the passage as well as who it was written for in the surrounding verses. You may also be able to find information on why it was written and the topic the author was trying to address or explore. [3] X Research source For example, if you are reading verses that describe Jesus’ birth, check the surrounding verses for any details about events that lead to Jesus’ birth or an introduction by the author."

    {
      "title": "Determine the key ideas and questions in the verses.",
      "content": "Determine the key ideas and questions in the verses. Think about what ideas or concepts the verses are highlighting and discussing. Underline or circle keywords that relate to an idea or concept. Look for any phrases or words that raise questions for you. Spend time pulling the verses apart so you can better understand them. [4] X Research source For example, you may focus on a specific phrase like “I will fear no evil, for you are with me” to determine the key idea in the verses. You may then ask questions about the phrase, such as “Who is the ‘you’ and the ‘me’ in the phrase?” “What does this phrase say about my relationship to God?” “What evils do I fear or worry about in my life?”"

      "title": "Interpret the verses using the logic and culture of the past.",
      "content": "Interpret the verses using the logic and culture of the past. Avoid trying to impose your modern understanding on the verses. Instead, think about the traditions, customs, and culture of the time the verses were composed. Recognize the cultural differences between now and then. Put yourself in the shoes of someone in the past and read the verses metaphorically, rather than literally. [5] X Research source For example, you may analyze a verse like, “Some trust in chariots and some in horses, but we trust in the name of the Lord our God” by considering the importance of chariots and horses in the time the verse was written. Think about how you can interpret older ideas or terms using a modern perspective."

      "title": "Pray on the verses.",
      "content": "Pray on the verses. Once you have read and considered the verses closely, take some time to pray on it. Close your eyes and place your hands in prayer or over the verses. Ask God for guidance on the verses. Think about how God might want you to interpret and understand them. [6] X Research source You may find it useful to pray often on the verses as you read the Bible. This can deepen your spiritual practice and make you feel closer to God as you read."

      "title": "Locate verses using the book name, the chapter number and the verse number.",
      "content": "Locate verses using the book name, the chapter number and the verse number. The Bible is broken into several books that have been bound together. The books are then separated into numbered chapters and verses. The chapters and verses have been put in place by scholars to make finding a passage in the Bible easier. To look up a particular Bible verse, search for the name of the book. Then, check for the chapter number and the verse numbers. For example, if you are trying to find Proverbs 31:25-27, you would look in the book of Proverbs for chapter 31, verse 25-27. Keep in mind that from a spiritual perspective, the chapter and verse numbers do not have any significance on the meaning of the verses. They are strictly there to make locating particular verses easier."
