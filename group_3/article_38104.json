      "content": "Choose a saving format. The options for saving the page vary depending on the browser you're using: Chrome and Edge: Webpage, single file creates one file (with the .mthml file extension) that contains the current page's contents and images. This is a great choice to capture everything at once. Webpage, complete also downloads the entire webpage, but places all images into a separate folder. Webpage, HTML only saves the HTML code, which doesn't include any images—just the raw code, which you can use as reference for your own webpages. Safari: [2] X Research source Web archive saves everything on the page, including the pictures, in the .webarchive format. All content will be in this single file. Page source saves just the HTML code, which is only useful if you want to use that page's code as guidance for your own webpage."

Keep in mind that any links coded into the page may still link to online sources that were not saved to your PC. If you saved the page as a .mhtml (Webpage, single file) or .webarchive (Web Archive), you can double-click that file to open the page in your default browser. If you saved the \"Complete\" version of the page, you'll have both a file and a folder with the same name inside the folder you selected in the last step. Double-click the file ending in .html or .htm in the folder you selected to view the page in your browser. Be sure to keep the associated media folder in the same location as the .html file—if you move either the .html file or the folder elsewhere, the saved webpage won't load any images. If you're offline and the page you saved has streaming video, the video will not load until you connect to the internet again."

Web Archives create a file that works more like a regular web page—you can open it in Safari on any of your Apple devices, and click or tap links like a website.
