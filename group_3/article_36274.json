      "content": "Test the alcohol on a small area. Wet a cotton ball with alcohol and rub it on an inconspicuous spot on the wall, first. Check for stains, discoloration, or residue. If the alcohol produces any unwanted affects, then try a different method. [2] X Research source You should always test products and solutions on small, hidden areas first before using them on larger surfaces to avoid unwanted effects."

      "content": "Dampen a clean, white cloth with the alcohol. Hold the cloth with your finger on top of the bottleâ€™s opening. In a quick motion, turn the bottle upside down then right side up again to dampen the cloth. Then gently rub the cloth over the stain in a circular motion. Once the stain begins to transfer to the cloth, use a different area of the cloth to finish cleaning the stain. [3] X Research source Alternatively, you can use nail polish remover if the rubbing alcohol does not work. Just remember to wipe the area clean with water before applying the nail polish remover onto the stain. [4] X Research source"

Use a sanding pole to sand large areas like an entire wall. To avoid a patchy appearance, you may want to sand, prime, and repaint the whole wall."

      "content": "Repaint the wall with at least two coats of paint. Dip a clean or new paintbrush into your bucket of paint until one-third of the brush is covered in paint. Tap the brush against the side of the can to remove excess paint. Paint the area in a straight up and down motion. Let the first coat dry completely before applying a second or third coat. When painting the wall, try to paint in full daylight so you can get an even finish. You can sand in between paint jobs to get a professional look. Apply as many coats as you need until the color you want is achieved."
