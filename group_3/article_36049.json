      "content": "Avoid lifting or other heavy activity for several days. If you feel pain after lifting, exercising, or stretching, avoid putting pressure or stretching your wrists until the pain goes away. This can take several days depending on how injured your wrists are. [1] X Research source Resting the wrists can reduce inflammation and prevent more damage to the muscles around your wrists. Some movement may help your wrists, however, by maintaining your range of motion. You can do normal daily activities, such as typing or cleaning."

      "content": "Do wrist circles to keep your wrists flexible. As long as you do not have any fractures or tears in your wrist, wrist circles can improve your range of motion, reduce stiffness, and promote healing. To do wrist circles, slowly roll your wrist clockwise up to 10 times. Next, go counterclockwise for 10 times. [2] X Research source If you need support, wear wrist splints while you do normal daily activities to prevent re-injury. Buy wrist splints from a pharmacy or supermarket. Avoid wearing them for too long, as they could reduce your wrist's mobility."

      "content": "Do bending stretches to strengthen your muscles. Prevent tension from building up in your muscles by gently stretching before you lift. Keep your forearms and elbows straight while you bend your wrists up. Hold the stretch for 30 to 60 seconds. Bend your wrists in the opposite direction and hold the stretch for 30 to 60 more seconds. [9] X Research source You can also do this stretch throughout the day to improve your wrists' range of motion. Alternatively, try wrist curls, which can strengthen the muscles around the joint of your wrist. [10] X Expert Source Laila Ajani Fitness Trainer Expert Interview. 31 October 2019.

      "content": "Keep your wrists in a neutral position when you lift. Pay attention to how you use your wrists as you lift. They shouldn't be curling or taking on the bulk of the weight. Instead, your wrists should be straight or neutral. Keep the back of your hand lined up flat with your forearm. For example, if you're doing bicep curls, keep your wrists straight as you bring the weights toward you. [12] X Research source If you feel any pain as you lift something, change grips to a better position that doesn't hurt. This might mean holding an object from different sides or using one hand or arm to do more of the lifting. [13] X Expert Source Laila Ajani Fitness Trainer Expert Interview. 31 October 2019."
