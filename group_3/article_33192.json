You need at least 2 people to play Hide and Go Seek (1 person to hide, and 1 to seek), but there’s no limit for how many players you can have. [1] X Research source The more people you have, the more fun you’ll have! It's a good idea to let parents or other adults know what you're playing in case they get worried about where everyone is."

      "title": "Set rules for where players can hide.",
      "content": "Set rules for where players can hide. Gather the players and tell them the boundaries—which places are off limits, and which are fair game. [2] X Research source For example, you might decide you can only hide inside the house, not outside. Or, maybe hiding in the yard is fair, but no hiding in the basement, which might scare the younger players. Keep everyone’s safety in mind. Remind everyone to choose safe spaces to hide, which they won’t get stuck in, and let them know they can shout if they need someone to come get them. Make sure everyone understands the importance of respecting privacy. Mention personal areas that are off-limits, like parents’ rooms, and tell all players not to snoop or touch other people's personal belongings."

[3] X Research source Choose 1 player to be the seeker before the game starts. There are a lot of ways to choose. You might have a volunteer, or count down from 3 and see whoever says, \"Not it!\" last. If you can’t decide, have everyone play Rock, Paper, Scissors . Start with 2 people, then have the winner play the next person, and keep playing until you have only 1 winner, who will be the seeker."

      "content": "Run and hide while the seeker counts to 100. The seeker stays put and shuts their eyes, then counts up to 100, counting, “One Mississippi, two Mississippi, three Mississippi…” Meanwhile, everyone else runs off and finds a hiding place. [4] X Research source Be a master at Hide and Go Seek by staying quiet as you run for a hiding space, otherwise the seeker might hear which direction you went and start searching there first. The best hiding places are ones that the seeker might not even think to check, like behind some coats in a closet or underneath the covers of a messy bed."

      "title": "Stay hidden while the seeker comes to find you.",
      "content": "Stay hidden while the seeker comes to find you. Once the seeker is done counting, they yell, \"Ready or not, here I come!\" to warn others that they’re about to start searching. [5] X Research source At this point, they look high and low, trying to find the other players. Once you’ve been found, you’re out! When you’re out, wait at the place the seeker counted, or follow the seeker around and watch as they try to find the other players. Remain still and quiet in your hiding spot. You don't want to give yourself up once you're hidden! If you're noisy, even the best hiding spot won't conceal you. Hiders are allowed to move or switch hiding places if the seeker is nearby. But if the seeker already came and didn’t find you, stay put. You’ve got a great hiding spot."

Another version is that all the hiders have to get back to home base before everyone else is tagged, or else they're out."

The last seeker to find the group of hiders is the hider in the next game. [9] X Research source Play-Sardines As the hider, it’s best to choose a roomy hiding spot that can fit many people, like a closet or under a bed."
