[3] X Research source 4 2 + 2 {\\displaystyle {\\frac {4}{2+{\\sqrt {2}}}}} To see why this is the case, write an arbitrary fraction 1 a + b , {\\displaystyle {\\frac {1}{a+b}},} where a {\\displaystyle a} and b {\\displaystyle b} are irrational. Then the expression ( a + b ) ( a + b ) = a 2 + 2 a b + b 2 {\\displaystyle (a+b)(a+b)=a^{2}+2ab+b^{2}} contains a cross-term 2 a b . {\\displaystyle 2ab.} If at least one of a {\\displaystyle a} and b {\\displaystyle b} is irrational, then the cross-term will contain a radical.

Going back to our arbitrary fraction 1 a + b , {\\displaystyle {\\frac {1}{a+b}},} multiplying by the conjugate in the numerator and denominator results in the denominator being ( a + b ) ( a − b ) = a 2 − b 2 . {\\displaystyle (a+b)(a-b)=a^{2}-b^{2}.} The key here is that there are no cross-terms.
