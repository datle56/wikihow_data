      "content": "Listen. The importance of listening in a relationship cannot be stressed enough. [1] X Research source Even if what she is saying is boring to you, pay attention because it isn't boring to her. Learn to listen \"between the lines\" and infer what you can do to help her. Listening shows that you are invested in her life, and will build her trust. Beyond just listening, react to what she says. Become involved in the conversation, but don't take it over. Do not try to solve all her problems, since she probably just wants to feel heard."

      "content": "Write her a love note. A written note shows her that you care enough to share your feelings with her. Make sure it is handwritten; don't type and print a note! Here are some starters: \"I've been thinking about you all day...\" \"I wish I could be there with you, but this note will have to do...\" \"I can't wait until I see you next...\" Place the note where it will have the most impact. Ideally, finding the note should be a surprise. For example, if you know she has to read certain pages of a book for school, place it between those pages. If you are sleeping together, write a note on the bathroom mirror with soap, or place a love note on her nightstand."

You don't have to spend an arm and a leg, but avoid just giving her a bar from the candy aisle. Look for boutique chocolates and remember that a little goes a long way. Imported candies are a fancy way to show that you care about her, and can be exciting to try. They're not terribly expensive either. Bake her some cookies. This shows thoughtfulness as well as adeptness in the kitchen. If she doesn't like sweets, surprise her with her favorite snack."

Flowers can get expensive, however, so save them for truly special occasions. [3] X Research source Most supermarkets have bouquets available for less than $20. If you know your girlfriend's favorite colors or flowers, talk to a florist and have them help you design a bouquet. If you have access to wildflowers, pick and make her one yourself. Just be sure that you don't cut someone's private flowers. If your girlfriend is having a bad day at the office, have some flowers delivered. This can be expensive, but it shows you care and she can show off to her coworkers. A single flower can be just as good as a whole bouquet. It's the gesture of giving that is the most important."

      "content": "Cook her a meal. Not only does this make for a good date, it shows that you know your way around the kitchen. Don't worry too much about messing up, the thought matters much more than the execution. Plan your meal. Find some simple recipes that don't have too many steps. Try to time your preparations so that all the items are ready at the same time. Make sure the meal is balanced. Include a vegetable side, and don't serve huge portions. Pasta is usually a safe choice, as it is fairly easy to cook and most people will enjoy it. The dining area should be cleaned before dinner. Light a candle or two and make sure that all the dinnerware is placed correctly. If you're old enough, serve dinner with a modest bottle of wine."

Basically, you want to collect songs that you feel she will enjoy, as well as songs that show how you feel about her. Memory is heavily influenced by music, and a good Mix CD will be remembered for a long time. [5] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Create the track list. You want her to be able to listen to the whole thing without getting bored or skipping tracks. Make sure that the first song grabs her attention, and that the subsequent songs flow well. Most music software will let you burn CD's. Check here for specific instructions on how to burn the CD If she uses a service like iTunes or Spotify, you can create a digital playlist and share it with her. This will allow you to make a playlist longer than a CD allows, but the lack of a tangible item can make the gift seem a little less special."

      "content": "Plan a picnic. Similar to cooking her a meal, planning a picnic shows that you care about her and that you think ahead. Make sure the weather is good. Forecasts change all the time, so be ready to change plans if the day before it starts pouring down rain. Prepare a light lunch. A picnic should be a light and airy affair, and the food should reflect that. Make sandwiches, slice up some fruit, and pack a bag of light chips. For drinks, brew some ice tea. Take the picnic somewhere fun. Depending on your location, find a place that boasts a lot of natural beauty. Riversides, beaches, and meadows all make good picnic locations. Scout the place out ahead of time and look for secluded locations."
