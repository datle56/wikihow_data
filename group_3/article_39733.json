Sing the lowest note possible followed by the highest note possible, using a keyboard or piano to confirm the notes. Write down each note. The distance between the lowest note you can sing and the highest note is your vocal range. Once you know your range, find your passaggio which help determine your voice type. Determine both the highest and lowest note you can sing that sound rich and full. Then, find the points within your range that are transitional places--meaning they're not quite so easy to sing or that you have to sing differently to achieve the note"

      "content": "Work on your diction. Diction is one of the basic elements of classical singing. It affects the way we sing and how our voices sound to others. [2] X Research source While singing, open your mouth as only as far as is necessary and comfortable for your voice to travel unobstructed. Keep it relaxed. Sing “mah, mee, moo, meh, moh” and focus on singing each vowel clearly and accurately. Watch the consonants b, p, and f while singing as they can cause a popping sound. To avoid this make sure your breathing is controlled. In languages like German and English, you may need to emphasize these sounds. But, in languages like Spanish, give less air to these consonant sounds. If you have a voice instructor, ask them for some at-home diction exercises you can practice daily."
