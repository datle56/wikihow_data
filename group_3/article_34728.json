      "content": "Mark the fabric where you want to place the eyelet. Use a piece of chalk or fabric marker to mark the fabric where you want to place the eyelets. Create a small X over each area where you want an eyelet to go."

      "title": "Insert the cone punch and die base into opposite sides of the pliers.",
      "content": "Insert the cone punch and die base into opposite sides of the pliers. These are the parts of your eyelet pliers that will create a hole over the X you have marked. Select the size die and punch that you need for your eyelets. The die piece looks like a circular tube and the cone piece looks like a cone. Insert the cone piece into 1 side of the pliers and the die piece into the opposite side. For example, if you’re adding 1 ⁄ 4 in (0.64 cm) eyelets, then use the 1 ⁄ 4 in (0.64 cm) die and punch pieces. Make sure that the eyelets match the size of the pliers. The punch and die will pop right into the holes in the pliers. [1] X Research source Consult the manufacturer’s instructions for the eyelet pliers if you’re unsure what these pieces look like or how to install them."

      "title": "Center the die and punch over the mark and squeeze the pliers.",
      "content": "Center the die and punch over the mark and squeeze the pliers. Once you have the die and punch in place, position the pliers so that they are over the X you marked on the fabric. Then, punch through the X with the pliers to create a hole. Repeat this if you need to make additional holes in the fabric. If any fabric gets caught in the die after you punch out a hole, use a small, straight pin to pull it out."

      "title": "Remove punch and die and insert eyelet holder and splitting punch.",
      "content": "Remove punch and die and insert eyelet holder and splitting punch. Once you have finished making the desired number of holes in the fabric, remove the die and punch pieces from the pliers and set them aside. Then, install the eyelet holder and the splitting punch opposite it. Choose the pieces for the size of eyelet you are adding. For example, if you’re adding 1 ⁄ 4 in (0.64 cm) eyelets, use the 1 ⁄ 4 in (0.64 cm) pieces."

Position the back of the pliers so that they are against the back of the eyelet’s post. Then, squeeze the pliers to compress the post and secure the eyelet to the fabric. Repeat the process to add more eyelets to the fabric."

      "content": "Reinforce the fabric with fusible interfacing if the fabric is light or thin. Lay your fabric on an ironing board or other flat, heatproof surface with the wrong side (back or inner) facing up. Position the interfacing on the fabric with the shiny side facing down, and move the iron back and forth across the interfacing for about 30 seconds. Then, remove the iron and let the fabric cool before applying the eyelets. Don't reinforce heavyweight fabrics, such as denim or leather. Only reinforce light to medium weight fabrics. [2] X Research source You can purchase fusible interfacing in a craft supply store."

      "content": "Mark the fabric with a circle the size of the inside of the eyelet. This will help to ensure that you don’t make the hole too big. Use a fabric marker or chalk to draw a circle on the fabric that is smaller than the interior of the eyelet. Compare the circle to the eyelet to see if it’s the right size and adjust it if needed. [3] X Research source Check to see where to place the eyelet first if you’re using a pattern . Look for a circle on the pattern."

Then, cut across this opening at a perpendicular angle to create a cross-shape. [4] X Research source It’s better to make the hole smaller than you think it needs to be and adjust it later if it’s too small. If it’s too big, you won’t be able to adjust it and the eyelet may be unstable. [5] X Research source If the fabric is stretchy, cut a smaller cross-shaped slit than you think you’ll need."

Once you have created a hole in the fabric, take the top part of the eyelet and insert the male part of the piece through the hole. You may need to wiggle it to get it into place if it’s a snug fit. [6] X Research source Make the hole larger if it’s too small for the eyelet to fit through the hole. Snip along the edge of 1 of the cuts you made in the fabric to make it larger and then try to insert the eyelet again. If it’s still too small, snip to make the other cut slightly larger."

      "content": "Tap the top eyelet with a rubber mallet 2 to 3 times. Don’t hit the eyelet tool too hard. Just tap it gently a few times. This will push the top and bottom eyelet pieces together and secure the eyelet to the fabric. Check the eyelet pieces on both sides of the fabric to make sure they are pressed firmly against each other. If you see a gap, hit the eyelet 2 to 3 more times to close the gap. [9] X Research source Hold the edges of the fabric to help stabilize the eyelet pieces. Be careful not to hit your hand with the rubber mallet."

If you’re using eyelets for decoration, add as many as you like along the edges of the fabric or in other specific locations. If you’re positioning the eyelets for functional use, such as threading cord or shoelace through as a closure, make sure that each eyelet you add has a match directly across from it. [11] X Research source For example, if you’re adding eyelets to a pair of shoes or a bodice, the eyelet holes need to be evenly spaced on both sides of the fabric and aligned so that each eyelet will have a match right across from it."
