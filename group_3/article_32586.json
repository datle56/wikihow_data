      "title": "Gather a green spell candle, lighter, green leaf, and black marker.",
      "content": "Gather a green spell candle, lighter, green leaf, and black marker. Use the color green in your spell to draw money and abundance. It’s associated with a lush forest or meadow brimming with abundant life. When you choose items for your spell, the green color will help give them more power. [1] X Research source As you search for a green leaf, try to find a suitable one on the ground. If you must pluck a leaf from a tree, ask permission first and then thank the tree. If you can’t find a green leaf, use a dried bay leaf. Bay leaves are associated with victory and success and will bring that energy to your spell. Dress your green spell candle by rubbing a few drops of cinnamon or peppermint oil onto the shaft. This helps set your intention into the candle. A white candle also works for this spell, but green is preferable."

      "title": "Use your marker to write the exact dollar amount you want on the leaf.",
      "content": "Use your marker to write the exact dollar amount you want on the leaf. As you write on the leaf, keep in mind how much money you desire. Writing it down helps you focus on a specific outcome, which gives your spell more power. [2] X Research source If you don’t have a specific dollar amount in mind, write dollar signs (or signs for your local currency) or a word like “prosperity” on the leaf to draw abundance into your life."

    {
      "title": "Place the leaf under the candle and focus your intention as you light the wick.",
      "content": "Place the leaf under the candle and focus your intention as you light the wick. Set the candle on top of the leaf, with the writing side of the leaf face up. Focus your intentions as you light the candle with a lighter or match. Try to visualize the money in your hand or what life will be like once you have the money. [3] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Meditate on your intentions with the candle for at least 10 minutes.",
      "content": "Meditate on your intentions with the candle for at least 10 minutes. As you meditate on the candle’s glow, imagine it growing larger until it fills the room. Then, continue to imagine it growing larger and larger, sending a signal to the universe to send abundance your way. [4] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Let your candle burn down and bury it and the leaf outside your home.",
      "content": "Let your candle burn down and bury it and the leaf outside your home. Always allow your candle to burn out on its own, or use a candle snuffer to extinguish it. Don’t blow a spell candle out! This blows away your intention. [5] X Research source Then, take the leaf outside and bury it. [6] X Research source Alternatively, let the candle burn for a few minutes daily. Extinguish it with a candle snuffer or your fingers . Remember to wet your fingers before pinching out a flame to avoid burns."

    {
      "title": "Gather and cleanse your tools with water, salt, or incense smoke.",
      "content": "Gather and cleanse your tools with water, salt, or incense smoke. Cleansing your tools removes any residual energy, so you don’t draw in unintended intentions that derail your spell. You'll need a heat-resistant bowl in green, gold, or silver, coins, a candle, and a bay leaf. Run any waterproof tools under running water. If the items aren’t waterproof, sprinkle them with salt or wave them through smoke from a lit incense stick . [7] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Charge your coins with your intention and add them to the bowl.",
      "content": "Charge your coins with your intention and add them to the bowl. Hold the coins while focusing on your intention to charge them. Think about your intention in the present tense, as if you’re talking about how great your life is right now. For example, instead of thinking, “I want money,” think, “I am wealthy.” [8] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Anoint and then light your candle before placing it in the bowl.",
      "content": "Anoint and then light your candle before placing it in the bowl. Dress and anoint your candle by rubbing it with 2-3 drops of cinnamon or peppermint oil . Drip a little wax into the bowl and press the candle into the wax to help it stand if necessary. Use a green spell candle if possible, but a gold, silver, or white candle works as well. [9] X Research source Try filling the bowl halfway with sea salt before starting your spell. Place the coins in the salt, and then press the bottom of the candle into the center of the salt. Carve meaningful symbols or words into the side of your candle for more power and to help set your intention into the wax."

    {
      "title": "Write your intention on the bay leaf and burn it in the candle flame.",
      "content": "Write your intention on the bay leaf and burn it in the candle flame. Burning the leaf releases your intention into the universe along with the smoke. As the bay leaf burns close to your fingers, drop it into the bowl. [10] X Research source Make sure you burn the bay leaf in a well-ventilated area or outside to avoid breathing in the smoke."

    {
      "title": "Allow the candle to burn down, then put the bowl in a safe place.",
      "content": "Allow the candle to burn down, then put the bowl in a safe place. Once your candle has burned out, place it in a spot where you’ll be able to see it every day. Try the southeast corner of your home or room, the primary wealth area in Feng Shui. [11] X Research source Reflect on your intentions every time you see the bowl, or add more coins when you have them to keep the energy charged. Never leave a burning candle unattended. If you aren’t able to stay with the candle until it burns out, carefully extinguish the flame with a candle snuffer or by pinching it with wet fingers. When you feel your spell has been successful, take all of the items out of the bowl. Dispose of the candle by burying it. Cleanse the rest of the items to use again."

      "content": "Step outside your front door, face your home, and chant the spell. Leave your door open after stepping outside to direct abundance and good fortune into your home. Chant the following spell: “When this cinnamon blows, prosperity here will enter. When cinnamon blows, abundance will come to stay. When this cinnamon blows, abundance here will live.” [13] X Research source This step may feel a little silly the first time you do it, but it’s essential for the spell to work. Alternatively, write your own spell for abundance."

      "content": "Focus on your intentions and blow the cinnamon into your house. Visualize more money, a raise or promotion at work, or anything you associate with abundance for your family. Then, take a deep breath and gently blow the cinnamon through your front door and into your house. [14] X Research source Don’t sweep up the cinnamon when you’re done.
