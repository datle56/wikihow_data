You will use the tip of the needle to press down on the barb of the hook so that you can slide the barb out without it catching on your skin. A sterile, 18-gauge or larger needle should be used if possible — this method may not work otherwise.

This is not an ideal solution, but most fishermen are more likely to have alcohol on their boats than saline solution. [16] X Research source Hydrogen peroxide has long been used to disinfect fresh wounds. However, recent studies have shown this product to be largely ineffective.
