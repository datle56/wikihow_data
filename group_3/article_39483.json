Jump into the shower as soon as you turn it on, and try to keep the shower on for under two minutes. Beyond efficiency, cold showers can increase alertness, improve circulation, stimulate weight loss, ease stress, and speed muscle recovery. [1] X Research source"

Depending on the efficiency of your water heater and the number of other people needing to use the shower, your system might heat up almost immediately, or it might take as long as a few minutes. Find a few quick tasks that you can complete while you're waiting. Get undressed. Lay out your post-shower outfit. Quickly prepare anything else you might need for the day. Take out your shower supplies. Prepare your shampoo, conditioner, soap, powder, deodorant, towel, and anything else that you'll need. Brush your teeth while the water warms up. Once the water is warm, you can finish brushing your teeth in the shower. Spit out the toothpaste and wash your brush in the shower to save water and time."

Challenge yourself to speed up your showers by at least a few seconds every week. [2] X Research source"

Let it sit for thirty seconds while you wash your body or perform another shower task. Then, wash the shampoo out while you squeeze a bit of conditioner into your palm.

You do not need to shampoo your hair every day. If you're feeling dirty, but you're in an extreme rush, consider leaving your hair dry altogether. Use a shower cap to keep the moisture out, or simply hold your hair out of the shower stream."

      "content": "Lather soap efficiently. Squeeze a dollop of soap onto your hand, and spread your palm and fingers as wide as possible. Use your outstretched hand to quickly and efficiently cover the maximum surface area of your body. You may be surprised how much area your hands can cover when they're fully spread out. For instance, you may be able to lather each leg in one pass if you can almost reach around them. Try using a scrubber or loofah with body wash already applied. This can be a great way to cover surface area. Work symmetrically with both hands, lathering each side of your body at the same time. Lather each side of your chest and torso, under both arms, up both legs – all in tandem, with your hands spread out. This technique also works with lathering your hair quickly, as well as for drying off quickly."

      "content": "Shave in the shower. You might need to look in the mirror to shave your face, but you can shave other parts of your body while the water streams around you. Try shaving your chest, your legs, or any other area that needs a touch-up. Lather up with lotion or shaving cream. Shave gently and methodically, and let the water wash away the loose hairs. This works best for just a touch-up shave. If your body is very hairy, then you run the risk of clogging the shower drain."
