[2] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Keep in mind that having your patient change into a gown won’t always be necessary. Some patients may come in with complaints that can be checked with them in their street clothes, such as a cough or cold. Make sure there’s enough light in the room to see the patient well. Check to see if the room is quiet enough that you can hear the sound of the patient’s breath. Eliminate any hazards, such as wires or other items near the examination table that might prevent you from moving freely around it."
