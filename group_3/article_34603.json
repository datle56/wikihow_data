      "content": "Take longer cuttings if you want to propagate . To grow another plant from your cutting, take Y-shaped cuttings from the mother plant. [2] X Research source Make sure the cuttings are around 3-4 segments long. These cuttings can be planted in different pots to grow as many new plants as you want."

      "content": "Wait until your cactus has bloomed before pruning. After blooming, your Christmas cactus will be entering a growth period and putting out new leaves. This is the best time to prune as it allows the cactus to branch out and grow more stems.

      "title": "Twist the plant at the gap between segments.",
      "content": "Twist the plant at the gap between segments. Each segment is a rectangular shape with a joint at the end. The stem should easily break at this point as it is the weakest part of the plant. Make sure you twist quickly to avoid damaging the plant. If it doesn’t easily break, try using your thumbnail to separate the stem at the juncture. If twisting seems too harsh on the plant, you can trim it using garden clippers in the same place instead."
