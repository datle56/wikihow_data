      "content": "Access the buttons under the rear flap or light cover on the motor. The motor is the rectangular box that houses the chain for your garage door in the middle of the ceiling. At the back of your garage door opener’s motor, you’ll see a plastic piece that detaches. This is your rear flap or light cover, depending on the brand of garage door opener you have. Pop that cover open. For a rear flap, press the tabs located on each side of the plastic flap at the same time. Then, gently pull it off to remove the control panel. [2] X Research source If you have a light cover, gently pull it off of the garage door opener. If you have a newer garage door opener, the buttons may not be hidden at all. Use a ladder to reach your garage door motor."

Next to the button, you’ll see a small LED light that will illuminate when the button is activated. Hold the learn button down until the LED light starts flashing. [3] X Research source Some models call this button a “smart” button. It’s the same thing as a learn button. [4] X Research source Depending on the brand, it may also be labelled “program” or “connect.”"

The back of your garage door opener motor will likely have a plastic piece that conceals the control panel and light bulb. To open a rear flap, push the release buttons on either side of the flap and pull it open. If you have a light cover, simply pull it off of the garage door opener. [8] X Research source Behind the plastic flap or light cover, you’ll see several buttons and a light bulb. If you have a newer model, the buttons may not be covered by anything. Use a ladder to reach the buttons you need to access."

Hold the button for about 6 seconds and watch for the light to go out. When it does, release the “learn” button. This will clear the link between your garage door opener and the keypad and remote. [9] X Research source Typically, the “learn” button is colored, so it may be purple, yellow, or another color. If you don’t see a label, look for a colored button. It may also be labelled “connect” or “program.” You’ll also have to reprogram your garage door remote once you finish programming the door panel. Follow the directions above if you need help. It’s okay to do this after you program the keypad because reprogramming your garage door remote won’t clear the settings on your keypad."

What if I don’t have a keypad and I’m just programming a button-style control panel? In that case, simply press the button on the panel that you want to open the door. If that doesn’t work, repeat this process but hold the button down instead of clicking it once."

[14] X Research source Check your vehicle’s manual if you’re having trouble finding where the control buttons are located. What is HomeLink? HomeLink is a wireless control system found in every major manufacture’s vehicles. If you have 2-3 unlabeled buttons on your dashboard, under your rearview mirror, or in the ceiling/visor, your car has HomeLink. Most vehicles made after the early 2000s will have this.

Home improvement specialist Ryaan Tuttle says, “I've had to deal with myself in the past and it's the only way to open a garage door that is not opening electronically. That is a safety feature they put on doors, but people often forget about them when they’re working on a garage.” The emergency lock is usually located on the bottom of the door on its inside. There are a few different designs, but you typically just pull a metal pin out of an opening on the door’s track."
