In the moments after a spill, grab a sponge, paper towels, or a cloth towel that you don’t mind staining. Use this to blot the affected area, working from the outside in. Be careful just to blot the wine, though, since rubbing it can spread the wine over a wider area, as well as deeper into your jeans’ denim."

      "content": "Stuff your jeans with absorbent material. If you’re able to take your jeans off, do so. Grab some fresh towels or something similar. Stuff them into your jeans’ legs and/or waist, underneath the stain. Create a barrier that will stop the wine from seeping through the front of your jeans to its back, or vice versa."

      "title": "Pour salt over the stain.",
      "content": "Pour salt over the stain. Blotting the wine with towels will get rid of excess liquid, but expect some of the wine to have already penetrated the fabric. To deal with that, cover the stain with salt. Use that to draw as much moisture back out of the denim before it has a chance to dry. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Neutralize the red wine with white wine. Open a bottle of white wine. Pour it liberally over the stain. Do so in order to neutralize the red wine’s pigments and possibly lift the stain out entirely. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Do the same with white vinegar. Of course, you may not have white wine on hand, or you may not be too keen to waste any more on top of what you spilled. In that case, pour distilled white vinegar over the stain instead. This will also weaken the red and purple pigments and, like the white wine, could possibly remove the stain on its own.

      "title": "Pour boiling water over the stain.",
      "content": "Pour boiling water over the stain. This may be easier to do with a partner, so ask someone for help if you can. First, boil some water. Once it’s ready, hold your jeans over the sink and pull the stained area taut between your two hands. Then have your partner pour the water onto the stain from a height of roughly 12 inches (30 cm) to wash the stain out.

      "content": "Pour club soda over the stain. With sparkling water, don’t worry about boiling it as you would with plain water. Also, don’t worry if it’s gone flat and lost its carbonation. Simply pour it over your jeans to lift some or all of the stain out. [6] X Research source"

Pouring the liquids above works best on fresher stains, so if yours has already dried into your denim (or if you spilled a lot of wine over most of your jeans), don’t worry if that didn’t get the job all the way done. Fill a container with enough vinegar, white wine, or club soda to soak the stained area, and let your jeans sit in it until the stain fades. [8] X Research source Don’t use boiled water to soak your jeans. Warm water can actually make the stain settle in faster if your jeans are just sitting in it."

Let it sit until it absorbs all, most, or some of the stain. If it didn’t lift all of the stain out, wash it off and repeat as needed. [9] X Research source"

      "content": "Do the same with a dish soap and hydrogen peroxide mixture. Before you use this method, be aware that hydrogen peroxide can bleach some fabrics. Be sure to test your mixture on a small, out-of-the way spot on your jeans, like behind the waistband. If it has no adverse effect, simply pour it over the stain. Let it soak in and repeat as needed until the stain fades. [10] X Research source Because of the bleaching risk, start with a weak mixture that’s equal parts dish soap and hydrogen peroxide. If no bleaching occurs, feel free to double or triple the amount for a stronger solution. [11] X Research source"
