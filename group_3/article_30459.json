      "title": "Mars in Scorpios are powerful, passionate, and persistent.",
      "content": "Mars in Scorpios are powerful, passionate, and persistent. As Chumbawamba wrote in what could be deemed the Mars in Scorpio anthem, “Tubthumping”: “I get knocked down, but I get up again.” Mars in Scorpios are no strangers to failure, not because they’re incompetent, but because they just keep throwing themselves at what they want with a passion (and maybe lunacy) unmatched by pretty much any other sign. [2] X Research source So what they want, they usually end up getting. Due to Mars’ fiery, aggressive nature and Scorpio’s passionate water sign status, Mars in Scorpios pursue their goals with intense dedication that means they achieve almost anything they set their minds to . Scorpio Mars is also an extremely sensual sign: they emanate raw sexuality, but their romantic relationships are equally characterized by intense emotional connection and loyalty. Mars is Scorpio’s ruling planet (along with Pluto), making Mars in Scorpio an auspicious placement."

      "title": "Passionate",
      "content": "Passionate It’s a myth that Scorpios are all grumpy and want to be alone all the time: as a Scorpio Mars, when you care, you care so much that your love threatens to utterly consume you. And your deep, deep devotion to the people and causes you cherish gives everything you do a sense of meaning and urgency that sometimes verges on aggression or over-emotionality. You want the things you love to swallow you whole, and you want to swallow them back—like one big ouroboros of love and desire and passion. This is a Scorpio Mars trademark, but be careful: it puts you at risk of becoming possessive and of not being able to let things go easily. [3] X Research source Your passion doesn’t stop at the bedroom threshold: as the sign associated with the genitals, Scorpio is helplessly sensual and seductive. You go after what (or who) you want and aren’t afraid to explore your most deep-seated desires. In fact, you likely think it would be a waste not to. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Intuitive",
      "content": "Intuitive You may be a black hole of secrets and mystery, but you don’t tolerate mystery and secrets in others—and even if you did, you’re somehow really really good at intuiting the truth when it’s not forthcoming. When it comes to the unknown, you’re like a dog with a bone: you just keep digging and digging until you uncover the truth. Scorpio has imbued you with intuitive powers beyond most other signs’ abilities, but that’s not the only reason you’re so good at uncovering hidden truths: the combined influence of aggressive Mars and intense Scorpio mean you don’t shy away from a challenge."

    {
      "title": "Dedicated",
      "content": "Dedicated When you’re doing what you love (and, let’s face it, you don’t really know how to do anything else), you’re a tireless, dependable worker. You’re loyal to your friends and lovers, and most of all, you’re loyal to yourself: you don’t give up on the things that matter, and when you set your mind to something, you do it. You ain’t no slacker. Just remember that sometimes, “dedicated” is a nice word for “stubborn” or even “obsessed.” When you set your mind to things, you see them through—but this doesn’t necessarily mean you should . Use wisdom in conjunction with dedication. Otherwise, you risk ending up like a character seeking revenge in a Poe story. There’s more to life (and yourself) than your obsessions."

    {
      "title": "Fearless",
      "content": "Fearless Scorpio Mars’ love of a good challenge and obsession with digging in the (metaphorical) mud to find what’s hidden means you’re a pretty brazen and courageous individual. [5] X Research source You’re not afraid to explore taboo or occult subject matter, and you know better than most that it’s not just possible, but valuable, to be able to entertain ideas without holding to them. It’s this mindset that helps you understand complex truths or perspectives, even if you don’t agree with them. Your fearlessness and rejection of the label “taboo” are traits to be celebrated, but keep in mind what Nietzsche said: “When you gaze into the abyss, it gazes back.”"

      "title": "You’re exceptionally loyal—and demand loyalty in return.",
      "content": "You’re exceptionally loyal—and demand loyalty in return. There’s a darkness and an intensity to you that draws others in, but you don’t give your heart away easily. When you do, though, it’s for the long haul. You crave a love characterized by intensity, animal sensuality, and undying devotion, so when you find it, you don’t let it go. You and your partner are likely a power couple: you speak a secret language nobody else seems to know, and you’re always together. You watch your partner’s back and are their ultimate cheerleader (minus the, y’know, cheering). Your sex life is obviously hot, that’s a given. As a Scorpio Mars, it’s almost a requirement that you partner with someone you have amazing sexual chemistry with. When you’re not in love, you’re ultra-independent and a total boss, but in relationships (and that includes crushing on people who don’t know you exist), you can sometimes become a little codependent or obsessive. Try to carry some of your innate independence with you into your love life, and remember, your lover isn’t you ."

      "title": "You’d excel in a job that takes advantage of your intuition or intensity.",
      "content": "You’d excel in a job that takes advantage of your intuition or intensity. We’re thinking “private investigator,” “CEO,” or “mortician,” but there are really an endless number of gigs a Scorpio Mars would be great at. As long as it satisfies your dark curiosity or makes use of your aggressiveness and dedication, and as long as you find it personally meaningful in some way, you’re likely to thrive. Scorpio Marses tend to be pretty tireless, so a demanding job is likely nothing to sweat over if it’s something you enjoy. Also consider law, business, forensics, or research."

      "title": "Mars in Scorpio would pair well with Cancer and Pisces.",
      "content": "Mars in Scorpio would pair well with Cancer and Pisces. As fellow water signs, Cancer and Pisces are Scorpio Mars’ natural matches. They’re both deeply emotional and intuitive, and they each boast a level of passion that would make a romantic bond with a Mars in Scorpio strong, loyal, and intense. Cancer in particular is a very maternal sign, so in a relationship with a Cancer sun, a Scorp Mars would be well looked after. Pisces, on the other hand, shares Scorpio Mars’ love for introspection, which can yield an even more intimate emotional bond."

      "content": "Capricorn may also be a good match for Mars in Scorpio. Capricorn shares Mars in Scorpio’s dedication, ambition, and persistence. In a relationship, these two signs are bound to challenge and support each other through their goals. Level-headed earth sign Capricorn may also provide some beneficial emotional grounding for water sign Scorpio Mars."

      "content": "When Mars is in Scorpio, prepare for some cosmic motivation. Even if you’re not a Mars in Scorpio, when Mars is in transit in Scorpio, anticipate some spiritual revitalization and, basically, a reason to get up in the morning. If you’ve been feeling unmotivated or unsure of your purpose, Mars will help you figure out (or remember) why you’re here, and it’ll kick you into gear and help you take action toward your goals. Mars is in Scorpio from October 12 to November 24, 2023. It remains in each sign for about 2 weeks. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Mars in Scorpio is a time for sexual freedom. Let the sexcapades begin! If you’ve been in a sexual lull or feeling hesitant about pursuing your sexual desires lately, Mars in Scorpio is likely to inject us all with a little sexy-time courage. You may notice an increase to your libido, or suddenly feel confident about how to pursue your crush . Maybe you and your partner will begin to explore your fantasies in a way you haven’t before. [7] X Research source Whatever you do at this time, channel your inner Scorpio Mars (even if you're not a Scorpio Mars) to make sure you're listening to your intuition and following your heart . Now's the time to take action, but that doesn't mean you need to do it blindly."
