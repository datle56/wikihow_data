    {
      "title": "Cut the top of the bottle off.",
      "content": "Cut the top of the bottle off. Find the spot near the top of the bottle where it starts to curve inward. Take a utility knife and pierce the plastic with the knife tip. Cut around the bottle until the top detaches. [1] X Research source Be very careful when cutting the bottle. Keep your fingers away from the blade. If you don't have a utility knife, use scissors. Press one tip through the plastic. Then, snip around the bottle to cut off the top."

      "title": "Draw a design along the edge of the bottle with a marker.",
      "content": "Draw a design along the edge of the bottle with a marker. Pick a pattern for the top of your vase. In our example, we’ll do a series of semicircular lines for a rounded top. Take a permanent marker and draw a semicircle that touches the top edge of the bottle, about the size of a quarter. Repeat this shape along the whole edge until you work all the way around. [2] X Research source Get creative with your design! But try not to make your design too complicated. Remember, you’ll have to be able to cut the design out. Other designs include cat ears and sharp triangular spikes. If a design at the top of the vase isn’t your style, stick with a straight line—it’ll still look great."

    {
      "title": "Trim along the line to make the design on the bottle.",
      "content": "Trim along the line to make the design on the bottle. Take scissors and cut out the shapes. Trim along the lines you drew to cut the design into the top of the bottle. [3] X Research source Check that the bottle edges are smooth when you're done. Round out any uneven spots with more trimming if you have to."

    {
      "title": "Cut a hole out of the bottom of the bottle.",
      "content": "Cut a hole out of the bottom of the bottle. Flip over the top section of the bottle so the spout is downward, and flip the bottom section so the bottom of the bottle is face up. Set the spout on top of the bottom, and use a marker to trace around the spout. Use a scissor or utility knife to cut out a hole along the trace mark. [4] X Research source These pieces will connect later on, so ensure the hole is big enough for the spout to fit through."

    {
      "title": "Paint the bottle a color of your choosing.",
      "content": "Paint the bottle a color of your choosing. The best paints for painting on plastic are acrylic or spray paint. Choose one of these types and pick a color for your vase. If you want, you can also use multiple colors on the vase. Alternatively, leave some sections clear and paint in others for a nice effect. You have lots of options for painting your vase. [5] X Research source If you spray paint, make sure to do it in an open area and cover anything that could get paint on it. The bottle may need 2 coats of paint. Apply the first coat and let it dry. If you can still see the plastic through the paint, then add another coat. For a more elegant look, go with a metallic paint like gold or silver. [6] X Research source For a more artistic vibe, try splatter painting it ."

      "title": "Secure the 2 pieces of the bottle together and screw on the cap.",
      "content": "Secure the 2 pieces of the bottle together and screw on the cap. Once your bottle pieces are painted, place the spout inside the hole in the bottom of the bottle. Place glue or tape along the seam for extra stability. Then, screw the cap back over the spout. This will ensure the water in your vase won’t come out. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Place rhinestones or stickers around the bottle for extra decoration. Give your DIY plastic bottle vase some extra wow factor with added embellishments! Use a hot glue gun to stick on rhinestones, ribbons, or even lace. Or opt for your favorite decorative stickers to make the vase more you. Making this craft with kids? Let them go wild with decorations! A pack of stickers, permanent markers, and glitter glue can go a long way. Don’t be afraid to get creative! Try using other mediums to give your vase more dimension. You can wrap the vase in yarn, decoupage it with magazine clippings, or cover it in burlap. [8] X Research source"

      "title": "Cut the top off any size plastic bottle just below where it curves inward.",
      "content": "Cut the top off any size plastic bottle just below where it curves inward. Most plastic bottles curve inward about a third of the way up, making a triangle for the cap to go on top of. Find where the bottle starts curving and place the tip of a utility knife just below that. Cut around the bottle in a straight line until you come back to the starting point, and the top of the bottle detaches. [9] X Research source Try to keep the cut as level as possible, but don’t worry if you curve a little bit. You can even out the line in the next step. If you’d like a smaller vase, cut the bottle lower. Be very careful cutting the bottle. Keep your fingers away from the blade and always cut away from your body."
    },
    {
      "title": "Even out the top of the cut with scissors.",
      "content": "Even out the top of the cut with scissors. Make the top of the cut as even as possible. Use scissors and smooth out any uneven spots by snipping them off. Work around the bottle perimeter until the edge is even. [10] X Research source The edges don’t have to be perfectly even. Just avoid any large bulges or curves that are out of line with the rest of the border."

      "content": "Cut strips 2 in (5.1 cm) down and 1 ⁄ 2 in (1.3 cm) apart around the bottle. Take scissors and cut a straight line 2 in (5.1 cm) down from the top of the bottle. Then, move the scissors 1 ⁄ 2 in (1.3 cm) from that line and make an identical cut. Continue working in that same pattern until the whole bottle perimeter is divided into plastic strips. [11] X Research source Try marking the placement of your cuts before you start cutting with a permanent marker to help guide you. Make sure the bottoms of these strips are even with each other, or the folded design won’t be even."

      "title": "Fold the strips outward to open the bottle up.",
      "content": "Fold the strips outward to open the bottle up. Work around the bottle perimeter and fold each strip out. Turn the bottle upside down and press it on a table or flat surface. Hold it down for a minute so the strips flatten. [12] X Research source When you’re done, the strips will be nearly flat as they extend from the bottle."

      "title": "Loop a strip over the strip next to it.",
      "content": "Loop a strip over the strip next to it. Pick any strip around the bottle. Grab it by the tip and fold it to the right, over the strip immediately next to it. Aim to insert the strip into the space on the right side of the adjacent strip. [13] X Research source You can start going to the left if you prefer, but once you pick a direction, you have to stick with it."

      "title": "Tuck that strip underneath the next strip.",
      "content": "Tuck that strip underneath the next strip. Continue folding the plastic until you reach the strip next to the one you folded it over. Fold it underneath this strip so it rests in place. [14] X Research source The strip may not stay put immediately. Tuck it in tightly so it stays secure. Depending on how far you cut the bottle down, each strip may cover 3 strips instead of 2. This is okay. Tuck the plastic under the third strip as well."

    {
      "title": "Work in that same pattern around the whole bottle.",
      "content": "Work in that same pattern around the whole bottle. Repeat the same motion of folding each strip over the one directly next to it and under the one next to that. Continue until all the strips around the bottle perimeter are folded and tucked. [15] X Research source Make sure no strips pop out while you’re working. Go back and tuck them back in if any come loose. If some pieces are extra stubborn, use glue or tape to secure them in place. Check that the folds are all even with each other. Make sure the folds are all roughly the same length and shape. If any are loose or out of shape, pull them out and tuck them back in so they’re consistent with the rest of the folds."

      "content": "Fill the bottle with water and flowers. With your vase complete, you can now fill it up. Pour water in about halfway up the bottle. Then, insert the flowers and pick a nice, visible location to show off your handiwork. Consider adding some embellishments to the outside of your bottle for extra pizzazz. Glue on sequins or lace, or add some drawings with paint or permanent markers. Try doing this DIY project with multiple bottles of different colors. This way, you can create a beautiful flower display with different colored vases. If you have a large bouquet, place a few rocks at the bottom of the bottle so it doesn’t tip over."

      "content": "Peel off the label of a large, empty, sturdy plastic bottle. For this DIY flower vase, you need an aesthetically pleasing plastic bottle. A bottle that’s made of thicker plastic will give you the best results. Once you have your bottle, peel off the label and remove any excess residue. [16] X Research source Use lemon oil on a cotton ball to help peel away and remove sticky residue from the bottle. [17] X Research source For stubborn stains, soak the bottle in hot water overnight."

      "content": "Cut off the top of the bottle with a knife and smooth out the edges. Very carefully, use a knife and/or scissors to remove the top of the bottle. Sand down any sharp shards of plastic with sandpaper, or carefully apply an iron set to medium-heat to smooth out the rim of the vase. [18] X Research source Because the plastic is sturdier, it may be harder to cut. Ask for an adult’s help if you need it. This step is completely optional! If you like the spout style of your bottle, keep it. [19] X Research source"
