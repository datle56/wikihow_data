      "content": "Choose a depilatory cream for a painless option. Depilatory creams dissolve the hair at the surface of your skin. If used correctly, these creams are painless, so choose this method if you want to avoid the pain caused by waxing or epilators. Hair removal creams will dissolve the hair where it meets the skin, and the result will be comparable to shaving.

Leave it on for the recommended amount of time, which will likely be around five minutes, and then wash it away thoroughly. Wait at least another 10 or 15 minutes to make sure your skin doesn’t begin to itch or turn red."

Start directly under your nose and wipe out in both directions across your upper lip. Make sure there’s a thick coat of the product covering the entire area. If you wipe the product too far out and it reaches your cheek, immediately wipe it off that area with a damp cloth. If your product came with a small spatula, you can also use that to apply the cream."

They will likely tell you to let the cream sit on your skin for three to six minutes, but it’s better to err on the side of less time if it’s your first application. If you begin to feel a tingle on your upper lip, wipe the product away immediately. [3] X Research source"

If so, go ahead and remove the cream. If not, wait until you’ve reached the maximum amount of application time. Never leave the product on for longer than the recommended amount of time.

While laser hair removal and electrolysis can have permanent effects and work wonders for some people, they are not guaranteed for everyone. Moreover, the treatments can be painful and expensive. Ask a couple of different practitioners what they expect your results to be. If they promise results that sound too good to be true, consider going somewhere that offers more realistic expectations."
