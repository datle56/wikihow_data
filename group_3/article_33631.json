If you’re flirting online , Bilotta says “emojis can be a great way to add a playful tone to your messages and convey your sense of humor.” Send a 😉, 😈, or 😏 to lighten the mood and be extra flirty!"

Confidence is one of the biggest factors when it comes to flirting with someone, and if you don’t look or sound comfortable delivering your pickup line, it’ll show. Be sure to look at the other person directly and flash a smile if you’re delivering your line in person. Or, deliver your line with a playful or cheeky tone if you’re gaming or texting. If your pickup line falls flat, don’t try to explain it. Instead, make a joke about the line! For example, you could tell them it was terrible but that they were making you nervous. Bilotta says, “one of the best ways to put someone at ease and build a connection is to be willing to laugh at yourself.”"

Some signs that they might be interested include: having open body language, making eye contact, trying to touch you, fidgeting around you, or giving you compliments. [8] X Research source If you’re on a date, you can tell it’s going well if the person is “facing you or mirroring your body language,” according to Jacoby."
