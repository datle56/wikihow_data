      "content": "Astrocartography is a form of astrology that focuses on geography. It's sometimes referred to as locational or relocational astrology . Astrocartographers use your birth chart to create a map pinpointing the best geographical locations for you and your energies. You can use this information to find places where you'll thrive, feel inspired, and achieve your goals. [1] X Research source Similarly, your map can tell you which places to avoid because they're inauspicious and don’t support your personal goals. Astrocartography is an old concept, but was officially \"invented\" in the 1970s by American astrologer Jim Lewis. Lewis devised a systematic way to generate astrocartography maps based on planetary movements at the time of a person's birth.

The same meanings and associations apply in astrocartography. The closer you are to a line, the more you feel the energy of that particular planet. All of the planet lines will also be labeled with one of the following abbreviations: AC (Ascendant), IC (Imum Coeli), MC (Midheaven), and DC (Descendant). These lines have specific meanings that you will interpret in conjunction with the planetary meanings. Astrologers generally read your birth chart next to your astrocartography map to provide deep insights about who you are and where you belong."

For example, if you’re trying to decide on a college, your chart can tell you which places are most suitable for your energy and goals. Look for the lines marked \"IC\" if you're looking for places to move to, since those lines are tied closely to home and family.

Be sure to check the planetary symbol so you know what kind of energy you'll find there. You don’t have to visit these spots in person to reap the benefits.
