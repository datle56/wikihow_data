You likely know well in advance that you need to take the entrance exam and can register for it quite early. As soon as you register for the exam, mark your calendar or agenda so that you can plan out how much time you need to give yourself to prepare."

      "content": "Decide how much time you will devote to studying and preparing. Based on how much time you have until the exam, decide how much time you are going to give yourself to prepare. Most students take anywhere from 1-3 months to prepare in advance of the exam. The amount of time you want to spend is highly individual. Think of your schedule leading up to the exam: Will there be any holidays? Does your family have any trips planned? What will your school schedule be like? Choose an amount of study time that can accommodate your schedule. Generally speaking, if you have a busier schedule, it would be best to give yourself more time to accommodate for any days that you are simply too busy to study."

On this calendar you will mark all of the days you plan to study, as well as all of the days you plan to give yourself a break. Mark any days that already have something planned, like work, a sporting event, a trip, or a social event, so that you can account for that when planning your study session for that day."

      "content": "Consider how much time you want to study per day. The entrance exam is important, and you do want to devote a good deal of time to studying. However, you have other obligations and events going on in your life, as well. Decide how much time you can realistically spend studying each day. Perhaps you can devote 1-2 hours of studying every day or most days. On the other hand, maybe your schedule is a bit crazy due to a part-time job or a sports schedule, and you can only devote 30 minutes some days but a few hours other days. Plan the time out as much by the day as you can. Note how much time you plan to spend studying on each day leading up to the exam on your calendar."

      "content": "Plan out how you want to review. Entrance exams usually assess all of the knowledge you have gained in your entire schooling up to that point, unless they are for a particular course, in which they will assess all of your knowledge on that subject. It can be hard to pick and choose what is most important to review. Consider all of the subjects or topics that might come up on the exam and organize them in an order that makes sense. That could be chronologically, sequentially, or by some other method. Try asking friends who have already taken the entrance exam you will take for information about what topics came up on their exam. Yours likely will not be the same, but their insight can help you focus your review topics. It might be most beneficial to focus on the topics or subjects with which you struggle most. Reviewing everything you have ever learned will be tedious and likely impossible. Instead, have confidence in your strengths and focus on your weak areas to review and improve for the exam.

Study environments are highly individual. Make sure that this room has a desk or table at which you can sit or perhaps a comfortable chair. Having comfortable and useful furniture will help you maintain your study habits because you will not have to move to a more suitable place. Studies have also shown that it is helpful to rotate where you study. Find more than one good study spot, if you can. [2] X Research source"

While this is not necessary, having a test preparation book for your specific entrance exam can help to familiarize you with what types of questions are asked, how they are worded, and what exam scorers are looking for in answers. It will also help you to focus the topics you should study. These test preparation books often use discontinued exams from previous years. You can also check for online test preparation courses.

Auditory learner: You learn best by hearing things, so listening to a lecture or to a recording of a lecture can help you study.

Once you have realized what style of learning best suits you, tailor your study habits to fit that so that you learn best. For visual learning, try re-writing your notes or turning your notes into charts, graphs, or maps. You can also turn your notes in semantic maps instead of traditional outline notes. If you are an auditory learner, it might help you to read or repeat your study material out loud. Participating in study groups with other people who are preparing for your same entrance exam could also help, due to opportunities for discussion about study topics with others. For kinesthetic learning, find a way to incorporate movement into your studying. For example, you could sit on a stability ball so you can gently bounce, or you can read over your notes or textbooks while you walk on a treadmill. You might also find it helpful to chew gum while you study, but be mindful that you may not be allowed to chew gum while taking your exam."

When you have studied for 30 minutes, take a 5-10 minute break by taking a walk, going outside for some sunshine, or going to the restroom. Also set a timer for, or at least keep in mind, what time you want to stop. If you have marked on your study schedule that you will study for 90 minutes today, then stick to that time."

Often, the practice tests are old, discontinued versions of the exams. This has many benefits: You will become familiar with the question wording and style. You will be able to hone how much time it takes you to answer questions. Be sure to time yourself while taking the practice exam according to the amount of time you will have when taking the real exam.

Get in the habit of thinking positively by practicing positive self-talk. As you think about the upcoming entrance exam, be gentle and encouraging toward yourself. A good rule of thumb is to speak to yourself the way you would like to speak to others. [6] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source If a negative thought comes to mind, then take the time to think about it rationally. Push it away with thoughts about yourself that are positive.

[8] X Research source As you prepare for your entrance exam, it will be easy and tempting to have thoughts like, “I'm not going to pass this exam, which means I won't go to college, and then I won't be a successful adult.” However, this is catastrophizing, and you should avoid having these types of thoughts. Catastrophizing truly limits your opportunities in several areas of your life, because it sets you up for the so-called “self-fulfilling prophecy” in a negative way. If you tell yourself that you are not good enough to pass the entrance exam, then there is a good chance that you might actually do that—because you told yourself for so long that you are not good enough to pass it. [9] X Research source In the scenario where you do find yourself catastrophizing, take steps to combat it. Begin recording the moments when you find yourself doing this, and after a week or so, look for patterns. Does it only happen when you are studying a certain subject that will be on your entrance exam? Does it only happen when you are practicing a particular question type, like essays? Pinpoint when it seems most likely to occur, and practice that positive self-talk when those moments arise to combat the catastrophizing. [10] X Research source"

[11] X Research source While you are studying for the test, take the time to anticipate what obstacles you might encounter when taking the actual test. A helpful tool for doing this will be the practice tests: Notice which questions trip you up the most. Then, come up with strategies for handling those minor issues while you take your exam. Skip really challenging questions and come back to them later. Just remember to skip that question on the bubble sheet, if necessary. Use the process of elimination. Eliminate answers that are definitely incorrect or bogus, and make your answer choice from the remaining options. Go back and reread the question or related reading passage to double-check your answer. Read all of the answer options before selecting one. You may see one that you think is correct, but there may be a more correct answer further down the list. Practice highlighting or underlining important parts of the questions and reading passages. This will help you pull out key details when answering questions later. Read the questions before the reading passage. Then, you will know what information to seek."
