      "title": "Shoes that are too small or large stress your nails.",
      "content": "Shoes that are too small or large stress your nails. When you choose your running shoes, try them on before you buy them. Make sure there’s about a thumbnail’s distance between your toes and the fronts of the shoes. Then, check that your running shoes hug the sides of your feet since you could get runner’s toenail if they’re too wide. Your feet can slip forward and jam your toenails into the fronts of your shoes if they’re too large. Shoes that fit too tightly cram your feet at the fronts of your shoes so you feel the impact more with each stride, which could lead to bruising and blisters that turn your toenails black."

      "title": "Socks that are too tight put pressure on your nails.",
      "content": "Socks that are too tight put pressure on your nails. A good pair of running socks also adds a layer of cushion between your nails and shoes so they don’t hurt after a run. [1] X Research source Choose socks that are made from a light cotton or synthetic blend since they’ll wick away sweat and moisture. If you leave your socks on when they’re damp, it could lead to foot or nail fungus. Try on your running shoes with your socks to make sure you still have space between the end of your toes and the front of your shoe."

      "title": "Lace locks keep your heels from slipping forward while you’re running.",
      "content": "Lace locks keep your heels from slipping forward while you’re running. When your feet slide forward, your nails take the force of the impact with each step and get bruised. You can tie lace locks with any pair of shoelaces. [2] X Research source Lace your shoes with a criss-cross pattern up to the second-highest eyelet on each side of the shoe. Take the left lace and feed it through the top eyelet on the left side of the shoe to form a loop. Feed the right lace through the top eyelet on the right side of the shoe to make a second loop. Pull the left lace through the right loop, and pull the right lace through the left loop. Tie a bow knot to keep your laces secured."

      "title": "Silicone pads can cushion the impact on your toenails.",
      "content": "Silicone pads can cushion the impact on your toenails. Silicone toe pads slip over your toe so you have an extra layer between your nail and the shoe. Just slide the toe pads over the toes that are sore or bruised before you go on a run. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Non-adhesive dressings will keep your toenail safe without pulling it.",
      "content": "Non-adhesive dressings will keep your toenail safe without pulling it. If the pressure from running or a blister has made your nails feel loose, wrap a non-adhesive dressing around it before you put on socks. Change the dressing every day or when it gets dirty. [4] X Research source It’s safe to put a non-adhesive bandage directly on your toenail, but avoid dressings with adhesive since they could painfully pull the nail out of the nail bed."

    {
      "title": "Long nails are more likely to get damaged or ingrown.",
      "content": "Long nails are more likely to get damaged or ingrown. Cut your nails with a pair of clippers straight across following the natural shape of the nail. Keep your nails short so they don’t extend past the ends of your toes. [5] X Research source Over-trimming your nails could lead to ingrown toenails. You can trim the edge of a loose nail if it gets caught on your socks, but only if it doesn’t cause you pain. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Moisturizing your nails makes them healthier and more resistant to injury.",
      "content": "Moisturizing your nails makes them healthier and more resistant to injury. Before you go on a run, rub some urea lotion onto your nails for a deep, penetrative treatment that strengthens your nails. You could instead use coconut oil mixed with a few drops of tea tree oil to help fight against fungus. [7] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "You’re less likely to stress your toenails if you gradually increase your distance.",
      "content": "You’re less likely to stress your toenails if you gradually increase your distance. Rather than going for a long-distance run right away, start off slow at a comfortable distance. [8] X Research source As your toenail gets used to the impact of running, try increasing your distance or time by 10% each week. [9] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Keeping your socks and shoes on could lead to fungal growth.",
      "content": "Keeping your socks and shoes on could lead to fungal growth. Once you get back home from your run, take off your socks and shoes right away. That way, any sweat has a chance to dry out and you’re less likely to develop nail fungus that could weaken your nail. If your feet are sweaty or still feel damp, wash and dry them thoroughly."
    },
    {
      "title": "Running in wet shoes increases chances of fungus and weak nails.",
      "content": "Running in wet shoes increases chances of fungus and weak nails. Shoes get sweaty when you run and the dark, moist environment is perfect for fungus and bacteria. Leave your shoes out in the sun or near a vent after a run so they can dry out completely. [10] X Research source Keep a second pair of running shoes that you can wear while the other pair is drying."

      "title": "Giving yourself a little time to heal prevents you from making an injury worse.",
      "content": "Giving yourself a little time to heal prevents you from making an injury worse. When you get a blood blister under your nail, it could hurt or pop when you keep putting pressure on it. If you feel slight pain when you step down with your foot, take care of your nails by resting for a day or two to help the discolored nail heal properly. If a blood blister pops, it could make your nails bloody or make your toenail feel loose."

      "title": "A doctor can safely treat any issues that you’re dealing with.",
      "content": "A doctor can safely treat any issues that you’re dealing with. If you’re feeling a lot of pain from a blister under your toenail or a loose toenail, contact your doctor and set up an appointment. They’ll be able to prescribe medication, drain a blister, or safely remove the nail to help speed up your recovery. [11] X Research source Avoid trying to drain a blister or remove a nail at home since it can be painful and you’re more at risk of infection."
