There are two ways you can remove dependent packages: Run a pip uninstall requirements.txt command. If the requirements file is not named requirements.txt , change the command to the proper requirements file name. Run pip show [packagename] to see the dependencies for the given package. You can then use pip uninstall to uninstall these packages. Always make sure the dependent packages are not dependencies for other packages you still have installed."
