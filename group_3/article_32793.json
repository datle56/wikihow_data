      "content": "“Pink cloud” refers to the early, optimistic period of addiction recovery. The terms “pink cloud,” “pink clouding,” and “Pink Cloud Syndrome” are all used in addiction and trauma recovery communities to refer to the period of early recovery (often post-detox) where you’re feeling confident and optimistic about your ability to remain sober and avoid triggers. [1] X Research source This period is characterized by feelings of euphoria, overconfidence, and optimism."

      "title": "You’re feeling extremely optimistic about the future.",
      "content": "You’re feeling extremely optimistic about the future. Being optimistic about your recovery is great, but only focusing on the positive aspects of your life and being overly-optimistic about the future of your recovery is a big sign you’re in the pink cloud phase. Recovery is full of ups and downs, so if you’re only experiencing the ups and unable to acknowledge the downs, you’re probably pink clouding. [2] X Research source Carrying these feelings of optimism throughout your recovery can help you maintain sobriety. Just don’t ignore the negative aspects of recovery that come with them."

Once you enter the pink cloud phase, your confidence and optimism may make you believe that recovery is going to be easy and without challenges. You may believe that you’ll be able to easily resist any temptations or triggers and remain sober no matter what. If you’re experiencing these feelings accompanied by a sense of euphoria now that you’re free from addiction or trauma, you may be in the pink cloud phase. [3] X Research source"

Therapy, support groups, regular meetings, and a personal plan for sobriety are all crucial for staying sober after addiction. They provide a support system during the tough times of recovery. If you feel like you don’t need them because you’re cured or have overcome your triggers, you may be in the pink cloud phase. [5] X Research source"

The mental clouding that comes with addiction tends to go away after you enter sobriety, which can make you feel like you’re euphoric and on top of the world. The reality that you’re sober after addiction or free from trauma can raise how confident you are in your recovery regardless of the circumstances. [8] X Research source This initial hit of euphoria immediately after becoming sober is the root of the feelings behind the pink cloud."

      "title": "Dangers of pink clouding include an overconfidence that may trigger relapse.",
      "content": "Dangers of pink clouding include an overconfidence that may trigger relapse. The overconfidence that comes with pink clouding can put you into dangerous, potentially triggering situations. For example, you may feel like you can handle being around substances, so you attend a party where you have the potential to relapse. [11] X Research source Pink clouding can cause you to be short-sighted when it comes to your sobriety, taking your focus away from the more challenging, rigorous aspects of long-term recovery, like idealization or looking back on your time with rose-colored glasses. Once pink clouding ends, you may have trouble dealing with the hard work of recovery. You may struggle with getting to work on time, keeping your house clean, interacting with your family and loved ones, and committing to treatment and therapy."

They can give you advice on making it through the early stages, especially if you’re pink clouding. This will help relieve any feelings of sadness and anxiety that you or another person may be struggling with. [13] X Research source If you’re in Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) or Narcotics Anonymous (NA), speak up during meetings and tell your story. If you need help for addiction recovery but don’t have the money to enter a program, Douglass recommends to “check in with your county. Most counties, if not all, have a department of drug and alcohol services that have a list of county-funded or private nonprofit treatment options available.” If you’re struggling with substance abuse in college, Douglass says “to speak to the Office of Mental Health Services at your university. They are always going to be the first line in helping you navigate the next step.”"

If you’re dealing with feelings of euphoria and overconfidence, checking in with yourself and others can bring you back down to earth. Reflect in a journal or talk to a therapist, a sponsor, or trusted friends for an outside perspective on where you’re at in your recovery journey. [14] X Research source If you’re in NA or AA, make an emergency contact list of fellow members so you can reach out to them during hard times."
