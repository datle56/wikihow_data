      "content": "Remove any unabsorbed paint immediately. The sooner you start fighting the stain, the better your chances will be of getting it out. To remove unabsorbed paint, blot it up with a paper towel or gently scrape it off with a putty knife . This will help prevent the paint from spreading to clean sections of the fabric. Try not to rub the paint, as this will only make the stain worse. [1] X Research source Do not apply heat to the stain. Many fabric paints are set by heat, which means they do not fully harden until they are heated, usually by an iron. Do not apply heat of any kind, including hot water or tossing the garment in the dryer, until the stain is 100% removed. If you can’t take your stained clothes off immediately, try washing the paint stain out with them still on. This is better than allowing the paint to dry. Fabric paint is a water-based paint, very similar to acrylic paint. Because of this, most of the steps for removing fabric paint are the same as, or very similar to, how you would remove acrylic paint and any other water-based paints."

      "content": "Flush the stain with cold water. Once you’ve gotten as much paint off the surface of the fabric as possible, rinse the stained area under cold water until the water runs clear. It’s best to do this from the clean side of the fabric in order to avoid accidentally rubbing the paint into your clothing. [2] X Research source It’s important to use cold water to avoid setting the stain. If your fabric paint does not set with heat, it’s possible to rinse the stain with hot water, but be sure to read the paint’s label to make sure. Always read the care instructions before washing your fabric. If the tag on your garment says that dry cleaning is required, do not attempt to wash out the stain."

      "title": "Hand wash the stain with a detergent.",
      "content": "Hand wash the stain with a detergent. Once the stain has been thoroughly flushed, apply laundry detergent (or dish soap) to the affected area. For best results, use one part detergent and one part water. Try rubbing the area with your hands, but if that isn’t effective enough, scrub with a sponge or a brush. Old toothbrushes work well for small stains. [3] X Research source Cleaning expert Susan Stocker says “it’s fairly easy” to clean acrylic, latex, and water-based paints “as long as the paint is still wet. Immediately put dishwashing liquid on it and scrub and rinse in cold water. [4] X Expert Source Susan Stocker House Cleaning Professional Expert Interview. 8 November 2019."

This should get the rest of the stain out. If the clothing still has a stain after it comes out of the washing machine, let it air dry, then follow the steps for removing dried paint. [5] X Research source Do not use hot water to wash your clothes or put them in the dryer unless the stain is completely gone. Do not machine wash garments that call for dry cleaning or hand washing, as this may damage the fabric. Always follow the proper care instructions."

Dry cleaning may also work for washable fabrics if you were unsuccessful at removing the stain yourself. Sometimes, however, paint stains are permanent, so there is no guarantee the dry cleaner will be able to remove them. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Scrape off as much paint as you can. Before attempting to remove a dried paint stain with chemicals, remove as much paint as you can manually. Depending on the amount of paint that is on the fabric, scrape some off with a blunt scraper, like a putty knife, or use a brass wire brush or stiff nylon brush to remove as much as possible. [7] X Research source Be careful not to rip the fabric as you try to remove the paint. If none will come off, move on to the next step."

      "content": "Apply an alcohol-based solvent. Once you have removed as much excess paint as possible, soften the remaining paint with an alcohol-based solvent, like rubbing alcohol, turpentine , or mineral spirits . Apply a small amount directly to the paint to begin loosening it. For stubborn stains, let the solvent sit for a while before moving on to the next step. [8] X Research source If you don’t have any of these solvents on hand, try an acetone-based nail polish remover, hand sanitizer, or a hairspray that contains alcohol. Or, visit your local home improvement store to buy a cleaning product specifically designed for removing the type of paint you’re dealing with. Solvents are very harsh and can damage fabrics, especially those with natural fibers like silk and wool. Always test the solvent on a hidden area, like an inside seam, before using it. If your garment cannot be treated with solvents, take it to a dry cleaner to be professionally cleaned."

Stiff-bristle brushes typically work best, so just be careful not to damage the fabric as you scrub. It may also help to scrub some laundry detergent and cold water onto the stain to help the process, especially once you’ve removed most of the paint. [9] X Research source"
