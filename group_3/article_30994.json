Experience is the best guide here, so as a beginner you will just have to make your best guess, then mix extra to be sure you have enough. Use commonsense. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Add dry plaster and silica to the water. Gradually pick up handfuls and sift the powder through your fingers. This will break up any clumps, letting the powder fall into the water. Work quickly, but avoid dumping the plaster into the water. Don't stir or mix the combined water and plaster/silica. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "NEVER mix the plaster with your hands. Plaster reaches a high temperature as it reacts chemically with the water and can cause serious burns!. Use a wooden spoon or similar instrument as one would use an egg beater: Reach down to the bottom of the container and use a side-to-side movement like an exaggerated \"hello\" wave.
