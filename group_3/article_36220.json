      "content": "Buy a professional-grade eyelash extension glue remover. Since the glue used to apply eyelash extensions is very strong, regular eyelash glue remover may not work on your lashes. Get glue remover that's labeled for use on eyelash extensions and that says it's â€œprofessional grade.\" You can find eyelash extension glue remover at a drugstore, in a beauty supply store, or online. If you had your extensions professionally done, ask the technician which solvent they used. Then, see if you can purchase it from them. If you don't have a professional-grade eyelash extension removal product, you can apply castor oil, coconut oil, or oil-based makeup remover to your lashes with a small brush. The oil will help weaken the adhesive. [1] X Research source"
