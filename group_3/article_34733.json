      "content": "Consider having a professional perform this procedure. It is highly recommended that a qualified professional refill and recharge your AC unit. The procedure itself is dangerous, and if done incorrectly, you can damage your unit. Homeowners are permitted to add some refrigerants in the U.S., but the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) requires that only licensed technicians can handle R-22, or Freon. Belavus explains, “Unless you have EPA certification, you will need professional help.” Proceed with caution if you decide to do this yourself. Improper handling of refrigerant can cause injury, death, explosions, and property damage. Note: We often use the term Freon to describe any refrigerant, but it technically only refers to R-22 refrigerant. If this is the type of refrigerant your AC requires, you are technically breaking the law if you handle the chemical yourself."

      "content": "Schedule or perform routine maintenance before adding refrigerant. Belavus recommends inspecting your AC for signs of mold or debris “in the spring, before you start using it.” Your AC’s air filter , blower wheel, evaporator coil , and condenser coil need to be cleaned before you “ charge ” your unit with more refrigerant. Adding more refrigerant to a unit with dirty parts can damage the AC. According to Belavus, “Dirty condenser coils are one of the most common issues. Before every cooling season, roughly in spring, inspect your outdoor condenser unit for any signs of debris on the condenser coil fins. If the coil is clogged, turn the power off to the condenser from the disconnect switch and the electrical panel. Remove protective grills from the sides and clean it with a garden hose.” To clean the evaporator coil, Belavus explains, “Remove a few screws from the evaporator compartment and check for debris on the fins and drain pan. Get a bottle of room temperature water and flush the drain by pouring water into the condensate pan to make sure the drain is not clogged.”"

      "content": "Choose the right refrigerant for your unit. Putting the wrong refrigerant in your unit can cause combustion, injury, and property damage. Check your AC manufacturer’s operating guide to find out which refrigerant your unit needs. If you don’t have the operating guide, check the electrical control box or the unit’s cabinet for the information. The two most common refrigerants are R-22 and R410A. [1] X Research source R-22 is mostly used in older units and has been phased out because it is an ozone depleting material. [2] X Research source If your AC is leaking R-22, it’s important that you get the problem fixed as soon as possible. Since R-22 has been discontinued, the price for it has skyrocketed and will only continue to get higher."

      "content": "Make sure the outside temperature is above 55°F (12.7°C) before proceeding. Liquid Freon will automatically seek the coldest area of an enclosed AC unit between the furnace coil and the outside condensing unit. When outdoor temperatures are under 55°F, the coldest area of your system will most likely be the outside unit. The Freon will not behave properly in these conditions. [4] X Research source"

Your unit will either have a fused disconnect or a circuit breaker attached to it. If your unit has fuses, disconnect them. If your unit has a circuit breaker, turn the breaker off. [5] X Research source Warning: Remember that if your AC requires actual Freon (R-22 refrigerant) it is illegal and extremely dangerous to handle it yourself. It is highly advised to hire a professional HVAC technician instead. Even if you’re adding other types of “Freon” (like R410A) that aren’t illegal to handle, it is best to have a professional do the job."

      "content": "Check for vents blowing warm or room temperature air. “Leaking refrigerant can significantly reduce the efficiency of your AC unit,” Belavus explains, “So if you feel like your AC is producing less cold air than usual, try measuring the temperature output. The normal cooling temperature should be somewhere between 40-50°F.” However, a broken thermostat may cause the same problem. If it’s a refrigerant issue, the air temperature will steadily grow warmer over time because your unit is slowly losing refrigerant. If a broken thermostat or other issue is causing the warm air, the temperature of the air will probably spike or fluctuate."

      "content": "Look for ice on the coils. According to Belavus, “Any signs of ice forming on refrigerant piping could indicate a refrigerant leak.” Peek through the front window of the AC unit to inspect the pipes inside. If the pipes and coils look frosty or ice-covered, this means you’re experiencing a leak and slowly losing refrigerant. The leak needs to be repaired by a qualified HVAC technician or you’ll continue to experience the same problem. Adding refrigerant without fixing the leak may further damage your AC unit."

      "content": "Look for water accumulation or oily spots on the floor near your furnace. Inspect the area around your furnace. If you see water pooling around it, this indicates condensation. Your coils were most likely icy, and now the ice has melted around the furnace area. Additionally, Belavus explains, “Check around the indoor air handling unit and outdoor condenser for any signs of oily, dark spots, especially on the coils. Look for oily stans on refrigerant pipe insulation.” The water can damage your furnace and compound your problems, so it’s best to have a qualified HVAC technician come out to inspect the issue."

If you need to refill refrigerant, you probably have a leak . “If you suspect that your AC unit is leaking refrigerant, it’s important to have it inspected by a licensed HVAC professional as soon as possible to prevent further damage to the unit and ensure that it is functioning properly,” Belavus explains. Adding more refrigerant is a quick fix, but eventually, this will damage your unit."

Adding refrigerant incorrectly can damage your AC unit, while handling it improperly can lead to injury or even death. For this reason, it is highly advised that you hire a professional. It is also illegal to handle R-22 Freon without a license, so determine what kind of refrigerant your AC requires before attempting to do it yourself. [13] X Research source"

      "content": "Freon only needs to be replaced if your air conditioner has a leak. Because Freon circulates inside your AC unit in a closed loop, you ideally shouldn’t have to replace it. However, if the coolant pipe has a leak, the Freon will seep out, and you’ll need to replace what you’ve lost. [14] X Research source Some signs your AC is leaking refrigerant include having ice on the evaporator coils, making a hissing sound, and giving off an exhaust smell."

      "content": "Adding Freon costs anywhere from $100-$600. The cost of adding Freon to your AC largely depends on the unit’s size. Adding refrigerant typically costs between $100-$350, though it may cost up to $600 for large units, as they require more refrigerant. R-22 refrigerant costs $80-$120 per pound, while R140A usually costs around $20 per pound. [15] X Research source"

      "content": "Have your unit professionally serviced at least once a year. Regular maintenance is key to keeping your AC in good working condition. A professional HVAC technician will look for signs that a leak may happen and make the necessary repairs to prevent or fix it. They’ll also top off your refrigerant if it is below the necessary level. When getting your AC serviced , Belavus recommends, “Try to remember your service history and let the tech know if there are any pre-existing conditions with the system.” If you can’t get your AC serviced every year, Belavus says, “It’s important to get it professionally serviced at least every other year for better efficiency and greater lifetime.”"
