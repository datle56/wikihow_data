      "content": "Pleasure items for men include masturbators and sleeves, c-rings, anal toys, and more. When you picture pleasure items for people with penises (if you’re familiar with them at all), you may just picture a cheap, simple silicone sleeve or c-ring. Unfortunately, there’s a stigma around men using or talking freely about toys—even though a study found that 45% of men use them! Thankfully, if you’re looking to break the mold and experience a new sexual sensation, you’ve got a lot of options: [1] X Trustworthy Source Go Ask Alice Medical advice site with content written by health promotion specialists affiliated with Columbia University Go to source Masturbators , sleeves , or strokers: These toys surround the penis with silicone or another rubbery material and come in all different shapes and sizes to improve masturbation. C-rings: These rings go around the shaft to hold blood in the penis for longer and firmer erections. Prostate massagers or stimulators: These toys (like butt plugs, vibrators, beads, or dildos) are inserted anally to stimulate pleasure from the prostate gland. Vibrating toys: These days, you can find a male vibrator version of just about anything—sleeves, c-rings, anal toys—for new and more intense sensations. Toys for couples: Not all male pleasure items are only for solo use! Items like vibrating c-rings or teledildonic toys (toys controlled by a remote from a distance) can make intimacy with your partner more exciting and adventurous. Specialty toys and other items: Fetish items like nipple clamps or electronic stimulation devices can help you explore your sexual interests, while toys like FDA-approved penis pumps can even help treat erectile dysfunction ."

      "content": "Unique sensations on offer from TENGA The most basic masturbators and penis sleeves slide up and down to improve the masturbation experience. [2] X Trustworthy Source Go Ask Alice Medical advice site with content written by health promotion specialists affiliated with Columbia University Go to source However, male pleasure technology has come a long way over the years, and TENGA gives you a lot of exciting options when it comes to experimenting with different sensations: Suction: Suction sleeves like the TENGA FLIP ZERO are designed to create a vacuum inside the sleeve that feels like a sucking sensation. The FLIP ZERO even comes with pressure pads on the side that let you control the pressure and intensity inside. Spinning: Other sleeves like the TENGA SPINNER Series feature a coil inside to create a spinning motion as they slide up and down, providing stimulation all over with each stroke. Vibrating: Want to feel suction, spinning, and vibrations all at once? The TENGA FLIP ZERO Electronic Vibrotation takes the FLIP ZERO to a whole new level. Dual motor vibrations and an internal gyroscopic sensor deliver powerful vibrating and spinning sensations throughout the entire sleeve, and multiple vibration patterns give you control over the intensity. Choose your own sleeve pattern: The TENGA EGG Series egg-shaped masturbators come with a variety of ridge, ripple, and groove patterns inside that each offer unique sensations. The exterior design on each EGG reflects the internal design—just choose the pattern you want to enjoy (or pick a few) for a new sensation each time."

      "title": "Hard-cased sleeves",
      "content": "Hard-cased sleeves Hard-cased sleeves are firm and inflexible on the outside, maintaining consistent pressure and firmness inside (and providing a remedy for a too-tight “death grip”). Since they’re not stretchy and don’t elongate or shorten, they may feel slightly too big or small for certain sizes. The TENGA ORIGINAL VACUUM CUP is a hard-cased, discreet-looking masturbator designed to deliver a suction sensation controlled by an air hole at the top of the sleeve. If you’re looking for a more sensational squeeze, the PREMIUM VACUUM CUP features an interior sleeve that’s 1.5 times thicker than the ORIGINAL."

      "content": "Flexible sleeves Flexible sleeves don’t have a hard exterior, allowing you to control how much pressure you feel. They can also stretch as you pull downward, meaning they can fully cover almost any size. The TENGA EGG WAVY II is a small, discreet, super-stretchy masturbator that fits nearly any size (and makes for a perfect travel companion due to its inconspicuous egg-shaped design).

      "content": "Unisex and vibrating pleasure items can be used to stimulate both partners. If you thought toys were only for solo play, think again! Introducing toys that pleasure both partners is a great way to spice up your love life and try something new in the bedroom. For example: The TENGA SVR BLACK vibrating c-ring for couples gives both partners a new and pleasurable vibrating sensation during penetrative sex. Or, put it around your fingers to gift your partner a brand new sensation during foreplay. The TENGA UNI Series offers a unique experience for couples. This unisex item resembles a small stroker and can have the details on the outside to deepen pleasure for the penetrated partner or used as a flexible stroker when inverted the other way. Teledildonic devices are typically vibrating toys that can be operated from a distance with a remote or even a smartphone app. [3] X Research source A new way to play with power and unexpected vibrating sensations, these can be controlled from across the room or even by long-distance partners."

      "title": "C-rings hold blood in the penis for firmer, longer, and more pleasurable performances.",
      "content": "C-rings hold blood in the penis for firmer, longer, and more pleasurable performances. Whether you’re having some alone time or playing with a partner, c-rings come in a variety of sizes, styles, and materials to suit your sensual and aesthetic preferences. Simply slide the ring around the base of the penis, around your testicles, or both, to play with heightened sensitivity. Choose from silicone, metal, or leather rings. Silicone is stretchy and easy to clean, making it great for first-time users. Some are adjustable so you can control how tight or restrictive they feel. Metal rings are trickier to put on and remove (a generous amount of lubricant is recommended), while leather rings often have several snaps on them to determine how tight they are. Some rings come with extra perks. Some can vibrate, some have ridges or grooves inside for extra sensation, and some may come with extra attachments (like a butt plug). Warning: Wear an appropriately-sized ring that doesn’t cause pain, numbness, or excessive restriction, as this can lead to penis strangulation (a cutoff of blood supply to the penis). Wear your ring for no more than 30 minutes at a time for the safest use.

      "title": "Anal toys stimulate sensitive areas you may not have explored before.",
      "content": "Anal toys stimulate sensitive areas you may not have explored before. The prostate is a walnut-sized gland located about 2 inches (5 cm) inside your rectum. [5] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Its main purpose is to produce prostatic fluid (a component of semen), but it can also feel really enjoyable when it’s internally stimulated. [6] X Research source There are quite a few toy options when it comes to prostate and anal play, but here are some good places to start if you’re new to it: Butt plugs are teardrop-shaped toys with a wide base that sit in the rectum, stimulating the prostate and sensitive anal tissue. Softer silicone plugs are great for first-timers, but metal or glass options are available too. Anal beads are a string of multiple balls (sometimes of varying sizes) that are inserted into the anus. Like plugs, these come in a variety of sizes and materials, depending on your comfort level and experience. Prostate massagers resemble elongated, narrower plugs and are designed to interact with the prostate specifically. Some have another arm that sits against the perineum for additional sensations. Classic dildos and vibrators are phallic-shaped objects that are inserted in the rectum and mimic the feeling of receiving penetrative sex."

Opt for items made of non-porous materials like silicone, metal, or even glass that can be easily cleaned and sterilized without damage (most can be cleaned with soap and water, but read the instructions on the packaging for specific directions). Silicone will feel soft and stretchy, while metal or glass toys will feel firmer and inflexible. [8] X Trustworthy Source Go Ask Alice Medical advice site with content written by health promotion specialists affiliated with Columbia University Go to source Never use a glass toy if you notice chips or scratches, since broken glass can cause cuts in areas you definitely don’t want them. If your item is made from a porous material, place a condom over it to protect the material and prevent the potential spread of bacteria. Research the material to ensure it’s non-toxic. For example, items made of plastics with bisphenol A (BPA) are considered less safe."

      "title": "Discreet packaging or styles",
      "content": "Discreet packaging or styles If you’re ordering online, look for sites that offer discreet shipping so your neighbors won’t see a box with intimate words or images of your items on it sitting on your porch while you’re at work.

Both have their pros and cons—an online purchase allows for easy and discreet shipping, while a brick-and-mortar store lets you feel the toy and ask questions about how it works. [9] X Trustworthy Source Go Ask Alice Medical advice site with content written by health promotion specialists affiliated with Columbia University Go to source Check customer reviews for online sellers to see how satisfied other purchasers have been. Avoid seedy-looking roadside sex shops that make you question how reputable they are. Chances are that they’re not carrying the highest-quality, safest pleasure items (use your best judgment)."

Sex toys can give you more interesting and pleasurable orgasms, and orgasming is linked to a number of health benefits. For one, they release the “feel-good” hormones dopamine and oxytocin, which can elevate your mood and counteract the “stress” hormone cortisol. Physically, orgasms alleviate headaches or other minor pain and improve your sleep quality, stress levels, self-confidence, and heart health. [10] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Toys can also help you explore your sexual preferences and spice things up with your partner if you feel like you’re in a rut.

      "content": "Give him a heads up that you have something for him and present it privately. If you bought the man in your life a spicy new gift but aren’t sure how to give it to him without being awkward, consider these tips: Give him a playful warning that you’ve got something special for him. It’ll pique his interest and prepare him to receive something potentially sensitive. Give him his gift in private. He probably doesn't want to open a rotating sleeve in front of his family on Christmas morning, so save intimate presents for when you’re alone. Try bringing it out during foreplay. A great time to whip out a new toy is when you’re both in the mood and things are heating up—he’ll probably want to try it right away! Ask him to open it later if either of you is feeling sheepish. There’s nothing wrong with asking him to open it when he’s alone if you suspect it’ll save one or both of you a little awkwardness. Not sure what to get him? A classic masturbator or stroker is a great gift idea if you’re not sure what his specific sexual interests are. If you’re familiar with what he likes, buy him something that will gently expand his boundaries in that direction to help him explore."
