      "title": "Write a concise, memorable, and personal caption for Monday morning.",
      "content": "Write a concise, memorable, and personal caption for Monday morning. According to social media expert Kasey Dunn, your caption should be concise to “captivate the audience in the first eight seconds” of seeing your post. After a few lines of text, Instagram hides the rest of your caption, so include the most eye-catching details at the beginning. Most users won’t read a lengthy caption, so when in doubt, keep it short and sweet. Other tips to create a good “Monday Morning” caption: Draw from memorable quotes and influences: If you’re struggling to come up with a caption, think of quotes from your favorite authors, poets, and artists. Their words can perfectly capture your feelings about the start of the week, whether you’re excited or exhausted. Include a question to increase engagement : Try to incorporate funny and relatable themes, such as barely surviving or hitting snooze on your alarm clock. This can be reflected in witty questions like, “Can we fast forward to Friday?” or “Wait…WYM it’s not Saturday?” Add personality with emojis, slang, and references: Social media and digital marketing consultant Candace Gasper recommends “seeing what’s trending in pop culture and utilizing it in your post.” If there’s a viral song or meme, for example, you could reference it in your caption. Using colorful emojis and popular slang terms like “POV,” “left the chat,” and “let’s get this bread” can make your caption extra punchy too."
