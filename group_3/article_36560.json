      "content": "Mix equal amounts of baking soda and lemon juice. Pour the baking soda and lemon juice into a bowl and mix it together with a spoon. Keep stirring the mixture until it forms a paste that you can easily spread with your hands. If it’s too thick, add more lemon juice, but if it’s too loose, add more baking soda. [2] X Research source Baking soda and lemon juice will also help brighten and exfoliate your skin."

      "title": "Put the baking soda paste on the stains for 2-3 minutes.",
      "content": "Put the baking soda paste on the stains for 2-3 minutes. Apply a thin layer of the baking soda paste onto the stained area. Let it set and dry onto the stain for 2-3 minutes so it can lift the stain from your skin. [4] X Research source Avoid putting the mixture near your eyes since it could damage your vision."
    },
    {
      "title": "Wash the paste off under soapy water.",
      "content": "Wash the paste off under soapy water. After the paste has set, run warm water over it to rinse it away. If some of the paste still sticks to you, use a paper towel or one made from dark-colored fabric to scrub the rest off of your skin. The baking soda should have lifted the stains and brightened your skin! [5] X Research source Clean the paste off thoroughly since lemon juice can cause extreme sensitivity to the sun."

      "title": "Warm vegetable or coconut oil in a microwave for 15 seconds.",
      "content": "Warm vegetable or coconut oil in a microwave for 15 seconds. Put 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of vegetable or coconut oil into a microwave-safe bowl. Put the bowl in your microwave and heat the oil on high for 15 seconds. Make sure the oil is warm but not scalding hot. [6] X Research source Only use 1 tablespoon (15 ml) if you only have a small stain. The pigment in turmeric is more soluble in oil than it is in water, meaning it will lift the stains off easier."

      "title": "Massage the oil into your skin for 30 seconds.",
      "content": "Massage the oil into your skin for 30 seconds. Gently rub your skin in circles over the stained area. Work the oil into the skin to lift the pigment from the stain. After scrubbing for about 30 seconds, let the oil sit on your skin for 1 minute so it can draw out the stain even more. [7] X Research source"

      "title": "Wipe your skin dry with a cotton pad.",
      "content": "Wipe your skin dry with a cotton pad. Use a disposable cotton pad to pat the oil off of your skin. Rotate the pad after each pat so it can absorb the most oil. Continue patting your skin dry until the oil is completely removed. You should notice the lifted pigment on the cotton. [8] X Research source"

      "title": "Wash your skin with warm soapy water.",
      "content": "Wash your skin with warm soapy water. Lather a body or hand soap in warm water and apply it to the area that was stained.
