      "content": "Get a paper that's about twice as large as your desired envelope size. If in doubt, a standard size of 8.5 by 11 inches will do fine; you can fold and cut it in half before beginning if you want a small envelope."

      "content": "Fold the paper over evenly. [1] X Research source You should get a rectangle half the size of your original piece."

      "content": "Tape together the open left and right sides. Use tape to securely close the two open edges of the rectangle, leaving the top open. [2] X Research source The top is where you will insert your letter."

      "title": "Fold down the top to make a flap.",
      "content": "Fold down the top to make a flap. Make a small flap by folding down the open edge of the rectangle. [3] X Research source This will keep the letter from falling out of the envelope. A flap that is about 1/2 of an inch will work."

      "title": "Glue the flap to keep your message enclosed.",
      "content": "Glue the flap to keep your message enclosed. Place a thin line of glue along the inner edge of the flap, then press the flap down. This will keep the envelope closed until the recipient opens it. You can also secure the flap with decorative tape or a sticker."

      "title": "Fold the paper in half",
      "content": "Fold the paper in half lengthwise. Match up the edges of the paper to ensure the fold is straight, and press down on the folded edge with your fingers to make a crease. Then, you can unfold the piece of paper, and it will have a crease in the middle."

Both the top and bottom edges should be folded towards the center, leaving enough room in the center for a letter or card to fit, about one inch. At this point, the paper should still be lying lengthwise The triangular point of the paper should still be facing left."

[6] X Research source If your letter or card is very large, you may need to go to a craft store to find the right size of paper. For example, if your card is 8.5 x 11 inches, then you will need at least a 12 x 12 inch piece of paper. For a small 4 x 5 inch card, a 7 x 7 inch piece of paper will work."
