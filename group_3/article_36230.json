      "content": "Turn off your TV and unplug it. Since you'll be using water to clean the fingerprints on your screen later in the process, it's a good idea to turn your TV off and cut the power to it completely. If there's a switch next to your plug socket that allows you to cut power to the socket, you can turn the switch off instead of unplugging the TV. When your TV is turned on, any water that touches the screen could heat up and burn into the screen. To avoid permanent damage, always remember to unplug your TV before you start to clean it. Wash your hands before cleaning to avoid extra dirt or smudges on your screen."
