By knowing what causes you to react with anxiety, you can start to process these experiences in a more positive manner. It may be obvious, or sometimes seemingly random. Sometimes keeping a journal can help pinpoint common experiences. For example: Do you feel anxiety when you walk into a classroom? Is it the same for math class as it is for art class? Do certain people, like your boss or coworkers, trigger anxiety when you interact with them? Do you feel anxiety in social situations? Is it the same for a restaurant as for a concert? Is a group of close friends different than strangers?"

Then, look at your list and arrange the triggers from least threatening to most threatening. At the bottom of the list might be making eye contact while speaking, in the middle may be asking a stranger for directions; the top of the list might be asking someone to a dinner date or singing karaoke.

You want to start with the more manageable items first and build your confidence as you attempt more and more challenging items. Remember that you get credit for just trying--you may need more than one attempt to succeed. Every 'failure' is one step closer to succeeding. People with anxiety tend to take an \"all or nothing\" approach--either you summon up the courage to ask to sit next to someone at the coffeeshop, or you fail forever. If you did not do it today, try again tomorrow or next week. You may have to break down big goals into little goals. For instance, if you are finding it difficult to ask to sit next to someone at the coffeeshop, you may need to find a smaller, related goal. Maybe smile at a stranger at the coffeeshop? Or sit kind of close to a stranger? For some people, it may be to even go in the cafe at all! Start with small, easily reached goals. It may be too daunting to even start at a \"1\". It is better to gain confidence through baby steps than to try to bite off too much at once. Treat the list as cumulative. If you start feeling stressed and anxious, then take a short break before moving on. It’s okay to re-evaluate your goals and move at your own pace."

Take care of yourself and say \"No\" when you need to. Be direct, keep a neutral tone of voice and body language. Make your needs clear, and understand that being assertive doesn't necessarily mean getting exactly what you want.

However, this is an essential part of overcoming anxiety and moving forward with your life. Think of an activity that you enjoy, whether it's knitting, horse riding, or running, and find a group of people in your area who share this interest. You will find it much easier to strike up a conversation with people who have similar interests to your own. If you get invited to a party or event, make sure you say yes. People with social anxiety tend to shy away from group gatherings, but this can cause you to feel even more isolated and unhappy. Make an effort to go to any social gathering (even if it’s only for half an hour). You need to push yourself out of your comfort zone if you want to get better.
