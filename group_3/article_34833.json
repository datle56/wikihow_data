      "content": "Prepare yourself to say goodbye. Before making the appointment you will want to prepare yourself and your family members for life without your beloved dog. Make sure you have photos of your dog, spend some time with your dog petting and comforting it, and giving it a special treat or food. Remember to let any people that cared for and loved the dog join in this process. Do not lie to them that the dog is going to another home or that it ran away. Instead, explain to them the decision making process to euthanize the dog and explain the death to them in an age appropriate manner. An excellent book for kids is When a Pet Dies by Fred Rogers of Mr. Roger's Neighborhood fame."

      "content": "Decide how you would like your dog's end of life to happen. You will need to decide if you want to be with your dog to the end of its life. Only you can decide if you want to present for the process. Some people want to be, some don't. It only depends on what is right for you and your dog. Most veterinarians and their staff will be fine with you being present and will explain the process to you. If you can't be present they will understand that decision as well. When you call for the appointment to euthanize your dog you can ask if they will come to your home to do the euthanasia. Or you may prefer to have it done at the veterinarian's office to avoid unpleasant memories at home. Either the way the procedure is similar."

      "title": "Decide what you want to happen with your dog's body.",
      "content": "Decide what you want to happen with your dog's body. You will need to decide on the disposition of the body after the euthanasia is completed, basically whether you want the dog's body cremated or not. You will also decide whether you want to take its ashes or body home with you for burial. Do you have a box or a special blanket to wrap the body in? Or will you decide to have the veterinarian's office arrange for cremation, which will add more money to the final bill. Do you have room to bury the body in your yard? Can you dig in the yard if it's winter time? Is there a safe spot to dig? You may have to check with your local utilities to make sure you don't damage any buried lines on your property."

      "title": "Understand how your dog will be euthanized.",
      "content": "Understand how your dog will be euthanized. Many times a sedative will be given to your dog in one of its muscles. This will help it relax, as the euthanasia solution needs to be given in the vein, usually using a front leg vein. After access to the vein is achieved, the solution is slowly given and the dog's heart will soon stop. This normally takes place very quickly. The majority of veterinarians will place an IV catheter. When the owner is ready, an injection of a sedative will be given into the vein through a catheter. The veterinarian should use a stethoscope to check for a heartbeat following the administration of the euthanasia solution."
