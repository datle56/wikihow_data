    {
      "title": "Choose a comfortable pen",
      "content": "Choose a comfortable pen or pencil. Pens and pencils with a wider barrel (larger diameter) or padded grip tend to be the least painful, most pleasant writing tools for short and extended periods of use. Unsurprisingly, having the proper writing tool will make the biggest difference in minimizing pain from excessive writing. [1] X Research source Make sure your pen of choice writes smoothly without skipping or dragging along the page. Avoid buying pens that rattle or leave behind blotches of ink. Light pens are easier to balance, making them ideal for writing for longer periods. For pencils, try those with heavier lead grades, like 2B mechanical pencil lead , which allows for a lighter grip."

      "title": "Grasp the pen loosely.",
      "content": "Grasp the pen loosely. Don’t clench your fingers around the pen or grip it too tightly. Remember, you don't need to strangle it, just pull it gently against the page. Imagine you're gliding across the page with a quill—the lighter and airier you hold the pen, the less cramping you’ll experience. [2] X Research source Hold the pen from the back about a quarter of the way down, leaving more space at the side of it with the writing tip. Fountain pens are ideal for most writers, as they don't require a lot of pressure applied against the page. Avoid ballpoint pens as their design requires you to apply more pressure against the page and are often made cheaply."

    {
      "title": "Write slowly when you change your grip.",
      "content": "Write slowly when you change your grip. If you've been using an improper grip and are just getting used to a new one, always start slow. It takes time for your muscle memory to develop, so be patient and take your time. Only work up to faster speeds when you’re used to maintaining your new position and your writing is neat. [3] X Research source Cursive puts less stress on your hand than printing, as it requires less precision. Don't get discouraged and switch to improper writing techniques, even if you're faster at them."

    {
      "title": "Press the pen gently against the page.",
      "content": "Press the pen gently against the page. With your new, comfortable pen, press lightly and evenly against the paper. [4] X Research source Remember, firmer doesn’t mean better. If you prefer to use a pencil , go for those with soft lead, as it makes it easier to achieve a lighter grip. Try a gel or rollerball pen . Gel and liquid inks have a smoother flow, which helps to minimize clenching and makes for an overall better writing experience. Healthy, happy hands for the win!"

    {
      "title": "Write with your arm, not your fingers.",
      "content": "Write with your arm, not your fingers. Keep your hand and wrist still, and move your whole arm using the elbow and shoulder (like you are writing on a whiteboard). Avoid using your finger muscles—this might seem counterintuitive, but your fingers should only be used to support your pen or pencil. [5] X Research source Be sure to set your arm at a 90-degree angle on the surface you’re writing on. The most common grip for arm writing is to hold your writing device between your first and middle fingers while using your thumb to hold the pen or pencil in place. Another grip is to place your middle and index finger on top of your writing utensil while using your thumb to hold the pen or pencil in place. Calligraphers (very practiced writers) hold their writing instruments with their thumb and forefinger, resting the pen gently on top of their forefingers' knuckle."

    {
      "title": "Look at your hand position and evaluate it.",
      "content": "Look at your hand position and evaluate it. Hold a pen or pencil in your hand and ask yourself the following questions: Is my hand position neutral? Am I reaching or straining to reach the page or the desk? Are my wrist, arm, and elbow supported when actively writing? If not, make the following corrections: Hold your wrist straight and don't turn or bend it as you write. Move the desk, chair, and paper until you are comfortable. Ensure that your wrist, arm, and elbow are all supported by your desk or chair."

      "content": "Practice good posture . Sit up straight with your shoulders back and chest out—avoid leaning over the desk. If you lean over your work, your neck, shoulders, and arms will tire out much faster. [6] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source For longer writing sessions, vary your posture. Lean one way and the other in your chair, and try to lean back every now and then to ease the stress on your spine. Always make sure you're breathing properly —slouching can lead to reduced oxygen levels, as the position causes you to breathe from the top of your lungs instead of the bottom, which isn't as effective.

If possible, leave your workspace and walk around for a minute or two. Relax your hands, arms, and wrists during this time by leaving them slack at your sides or opening and closing them to stretch them out.

Then, relax your hand, recline in your chair, or even stand up and walk around a bit. Take the time to do some quick hand and finger exercises, such as a full finger bend. Place your elbow at a 90-degree angle on a solid surface and keep your hand straight up and down as if you were raising it—then bend all your fingers up and down. [10] X Research source"

      "content": "Limit total daily writing time. If you've been writing for several hours, return to your work later or the next day. For best results (little to no hand pain), try to stretch your total writing time across as many days as possible, for example, not waiting until the last minute to write an essay. While this may be challenging when it comes to school and work, the physical benefits will certainly be worth it if you’re looking to minimize pain and even prevent carpal tunnel later down the line. [11] X Research source If you have a lot to write, try writing in several smaller sessions rather than one long one."

Your doctor can make recommendations and help you implement them to make your work more manageable. [19] X Trustworthy Source Johns Hopkins Medicine Official resource database of the world-leading Johns Hopkins Hospital Go to source Some solutions include a workspace more suited to your size or work habits (e.g., a chair and table of a more suitable height, a slanted or elevated work surface), a different selection of writing implements, and a different means of writing (such as dictation or typing instead of writing longhand). Doctors can also refer you to an expert for an ergonomic evaluation and suggestions about your workspace and work habits."

[21] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source Wear your splint for 2 to 3 weeks at nighttime. Symptoms are typically the worst at night because your hand bends more when sleeping.

Topical NSAIDs like Voltaren are considered superior to oral NSAIDs such as Advil because they pose fewer health risks. [22] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source NSAIDs are not effective for carpal tunnel syndrome. Using NSAIDs for long-term pain treatment has been linked to stomach bleeding, ulcers, and increased risk of heart attacks.

They can provide relief lasting for up to a year, although some people report diminishing returns as injection number goes up. [24] X Research source Steroid injections are typically used to treat tendonitis, arthritis trigger fingers, carpal tunnel syndrome, tennis elbow, and rotator cuff tendonitis. Side effects of corticosteroid injections include a \"flare,\" which is pain felt 1 or 2 days following the injection, increased blood sugar, skin thinning, skin lightening, tendon weakening, and in rare cases, allergic reactions."

If you’re suffering from debilitating hand pain, more serious treatments like laser therapy or surgery may be necessary to provide relief. [25] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Ask your doctor if you’re a good candidate for either of these treatments. Laser therapy is a non-invasive option that reduces inflammation and pain by applying light-emitting diodes (electric current-conductor) to stimulate and promote enhanced cell function. Laser therapy is considered a good first step before an invasive procedure like surgery, especially for those suffering from neurological movement disorders like hand dystonia. [26] X Research source Those suffering from extreme hand pain due to carpal tunnel, arthritis, etc., may be good candidates for hand and/or wrist surgery. There are a variety of surgeries, such as arthroplasty (replacement of bad joints with an artificial implant), that may significantly relieve acute or chronic hand pain by reducing inflammation and joint damage.
