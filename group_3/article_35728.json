      "content": "Use a pair of pliers to pry off the metal cap. Grip the sides of the metal cap with a pair of needle-nose, slip-joint, or linesman pliers. Then, pull up on the cap as you move it side-to-side to remove it from the pod. [1] X Research source Alternatively, use a small flat-head screwdriver or dull knife to remove the cap. Just place the tool inside the indentation on either side of the cap and push up to pry it off."

      "title": "Remove the coil and the gasket inside the pod with pliers.",
      "content": "Remove the coil and the gasket inside the pod with pliers. Use pliers, a screwdriver, or a blunt butter knife to pry off the plastic piece that was underneath the metal cap; this part contains the Vuse’s coil. Then, insert the pliers, a small hook tool, or another long, thin instrument inside the pod to remove the clear rubber gasket piece. [2] X Research source The coil and gasket sometimes come off with the metal cap."

      "content": "Wipe the inside of the Vuse pod with a paper towel. Dirt and dust left inside your pod can affect your Vuse’s vaping performance and leave a bad taste in your mouth. Simply insert a paper towel inside the pod and gently wipe it around to clean out any debris."

      "title": "Use a syringe or dropper to fill the pod about halfway with e-liquid.",
      "content": "Use a syringe or dropper to fill the pod about halfway with e-liquid. Fill a small syringe or dropper with the e-liquid of your choice and slowly pour it inside the Vuse pod. Stop filling the pod when the liquid rests just under the center tube in the pod, which is about halfway full. [3] X Research source Overfilling your pod can cause the liquid to leak and prevent your Vuse from working as well. Do not pour your e-liquid directly inside the central tube, as this can cause the liquid to leak. Alternatively, use an e-liquid that has a small, needle-like nozzle or top to refill your pod. Use Vuse e-liquid refills or any other high-quality e-liquid to refill your pod."

      "title": "Tap the Vuse pod against a hard surface to pop any air bubbles.",
      "content": "Tap the Vuse pod against a hard surface to pop any air bubbles. Air bubbles left inside your pod can affect how the e-liquid draws through your Vuse, altering how your puffs taste and feel. Just lightly tap the pod against a table or other hard surface several times to get rid of any bubbles."

      "title": "Place the gasket on the coil and snap it onto the Vuse pod.",
      "content": "Place the gasket on the coil and snap it onto the Vuse pod. Take the clear, rubber gasket and place it over the bottom of the coil piece. Then, slide the gasket and coil back inside the pod. The gasket should rest just above the line of e-liquid, which helps prevent leakage. [4] X Research source Make sure the gasket is firmly on the coil piece. A gasket that’s not lined up properly can cause leaks or affect how your Vuse puffs. Wipe the outside of the pod and top of the coil with a paper towel to clean up any e-liquid that spilled."

      "title": "Reassemble the Vuse pod and ensure the cap clicks into place.",
      "content": "Reassemble the Vuse pod and ensure the cap clicks into place. Slide the metal cap on top of the coil piece and press down until you hear a small “Click” or “Snap.” This tells you that the cap is firmly on. [5] X Research source Pull on the metal cap to ensure it’s fully on the Vuse pod. If it easily comes off with your fingers, press down on it firmly to snap it into place."

      "content": "Allow the e-liquid to saturate the coil for a smooth vaping experience. Let the pod be for 2 to 5 minutes and then slide it inside your Vuse vape. Then, enjoy a slow, smooth puff of your newly refilled pod! If your pod tastes burnt, take out the pod. To fix the burnt-tasting pod , place your finger over the hole on the metal cap and blow into the mouthpiece."

      "content": "Vuse pods start to degrade in quality after refilling them several times. Vuse pods aren’t meant to be refillable, so it’s normal for your pod to stop working well or taste unpleasant after refilling it 3 to 5 times. Simply replace it with a new Vuse pod and refill it when the liquid is gone. [6] X Research source"
