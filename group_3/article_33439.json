      "title": "Spread out the Twister mat on a flat surface.",
      "content": "Spread out the Twister mat on a flat surface. Choose a spacious area to lay out the mat, like on the floor, on an area rug, or outside in the yard. Place the mat so the red, yellow, blue, and green circles are face-up. Weigh down the corners with shoes, books, or other heavy objects to keep the mat from moving around. You can play Twister indoors or outdoors. If you play outside, just make sure it’s dry so the game mat doesn’t get slippery."

      "title": "Take off your shoes, even if you're outside.",
      "content": "Take off your shoes, even if you're outside. Twister works best with 2–4 players, but you can use party rules to play with an even larger group. Have everyone take off their shoes so your game mat stays clean and to prevent someone from stepping on your toes. It’s okay to wear socks, but you may get a little better traction and balance if you go barefoot."

    {
      "title": "Choose one person to be the game’s referee.",
      "content": "Choose one person to be the game’s referee. Choose someone who isn’t playing as the referee and give them the spinner. The referee spins the spinner, calls out the moves, and supervises the game. You may need to assemble the spinner if it’s your first time playing the game. Switch off who the referee is each round so everyone gets a chance to play. No referee? You can still play without a referee if you only have two players. Instead of spinning, one player calls out the color and the other player calls out the body part. Alternate who calls what after each turn."

    {
      "title": "Step onto the ends of the mat.",
      "content": "Step onto the ends of the mat. Have all the players except for the referee stand on the mat. Where you start the game on the mat depends on how many people are playing. [1] X Research source For 2 players: Stand at opposite ends of the mat (near the word \"Twister\") and face each other. Each player places one foot on the yellow circle and the other foot on the blue circle closest to their end of the mat. For 3 players: Two players face each other on opposite ends of the mat, near the word \"Twister.\" Those players place one foot on the yellow circle and the other foot on the blue circle closest to their end of the mat. The third player faces the center from the side with the red circles, and places one foot in each of the two middle red circles. For 4 players: Split into teams of 2 players. Teams stand on opposite ends of the mat by the \"Twister\" logos. Each player stands in two circles closest to their end of the mat so the 4 circles on each end are covered."

      "title": "Have the referee spin the spinner.",
      "content": "Have the referee spin the spinner. Once all the players are ready, the referee sets the spinner on a flat surface and flicks it. When the spinner stops moving, the referee calls out the color and body part that it points to. Example: If the spinner lands on the blue spot in the “Left hand” section, the referee will say “Left hand, blue!”"

      "title": "Players try to move the called body part to an open colored circle.",
      "content": "Players try to move the called body part to an open colored circle. All the players move at the same time to touch a circle of the called-out color. Players can only touch circles that are empty, so if 2 people go for the same one, the referee decides who got there first. If all 6 circles of color are already taken, then the referee spins again. If you are already touching a color with the limb that has been called, you must move your limb to another circle of the same color. If you’re playing a 4-player game, teammates can share the same circle with one hand or foot each. After everyone is in position, the referee spins the spinner again to start a new turn."

      "title": "Eliminate players that let a knee or an elbow touch the mat; the last person standing wins!",
      "content": "Eliminate players that let a knee or an elbow touch the mat; the last person standing wins! As soon as a player falls or accidentally touches their knee or elbow down, they are removed from the game. Those players stand up and step off the mat for the rest of the round. Players cannot stop touching the circles until the spinner tells them to move to a different spot. They may briefly lift a hand or foot off a spot to move another one of their limbs during a turn, but they must let the referee know first. If they stop touching the circles, then they’re out for the round. As soon as there’s only one player left on the mat, they win!"

      "title": "Stay in a comfortable position to maintain your balance.",
      "content": "Stay in a comfortable position to maintain your balance. When you touch a circle, try not to overreach into an uncomfortable pose. Instead, try to keep your legs planted firmly, and avoid spreading them too widely. Be careful not to lean too far in any direction because it can make your position more difficult to hold. Try to assess your balance before you definitively place your hand onto a spot. Make sure you feel sturdy and relaxed."

      "title": "Crowd your opponent toward the edge of the mat.",
      "content": "Crowd your opponent toward the edge of the mat. When you place your hand or foot on a color, try to choose the circle that’s closest to your opponent. As you push the other player into a corner, they could lose their balance when they reach around you to touch a circle. Be careful not to physically push another player off the mat while you’re playing. Just stand still so you get in their way."

      "content": "Get into difficult poses more easily by Stretching out first. If you aren't used to contorting your body into unnatural positions, do a few quick stretches to loosen up. Some simple stretches to try out are: Bend forward, keeping your legs straight, and reach for your toes. Hold the position for at least 10 seconds. Twist your torso slowly to the right, as far as you can go, then slowly to the left. Hold each pose for at least 10 seconds."

      "title": "Wear loose, flexible clothing that will allow you to stretch.",
      "content": "Wear loose, flexible clothing that will allow you to stretch. Take off any heavy jackets or stiff layers before you play. If you can, put on a pair of loose shorts, yoga pants, or sweatpants because they give you the most freedom to move around. If you’re wearing tight clothes, you may want to avoid playing Twister so you don’t accidentally rip anything. If you have long hair, consider putting your hair up with a hair-tie or a headband before you play."
