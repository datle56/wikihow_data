      "content": "Sores on the skin A scabies rash usually leads to itching, and that itching can cause sores to develop on the skin. Unfortunately, these sores are prone to infection, which can lead to oozing. [3] X Research source Signs of infection include increased redness, swelling, pain, or pus or discharge from the sores. If you believe your rash is infected, call your doctor right away. Your doctor can prescribe an oral or topical antibiotic to treat the infection. These bacteria can also lead to inflammation of the kidneys and sometimes sepsis, which is a life-threatening bacterial infection of the blood. If you have symptoms like a fever, chills, or vomiting, visit your doctor to have them diagnose you with sepsis. To avoid this, try to be gentle on your skin and do not scratch it. If you can't help yourself, consider wearing mittens or wrapping your fingertips with band-aids to keep yourself from damaging the skin."

      "content": "Crusts on the skin Crusted scabies, also known as Norwegian scabies, is a severe form of the infestation. It is characterized by tiny blisters and thick skin crusting that can cover large areas of the body. Crusted scabies primarily occurs in individuals with weakened immune systems, because the impaired immune response allows mites to reproduce unchecked. [4] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Dermatology Professional organization made of over 20,000 certified dermatologists Go to source Another consequence of the impaired immune response is that itching and the rash may be less severe or totally absent. This is because itching and a rash are immune responses, which may not happen in a weakened immune system. You are at risk for the development of crusted scabies if you are elderly, have a weakened immune system, or are living with HIV/AIDS, lymphoma, or leukemia. You are also at risk if you have received an organ transplant and have any condition that may prevent you from itching or scratching, such as a spinal cord injury, paralysis, or loss of sensation."

They will likely use a needle to scrape off a very small piece of skin. The doctor will then examine the matter under the microscope to confirm the presence of mites, eggs, or mite fecal matter. [5] X Research source Keep in mind that you can still be infested with scabies even if mites, eggs, or fecal matter cannot be found. An infestation of scabies averages 10 to 15 mites found over the entire body."

The main way to distinguish them is through the mite burrows, which are not associated with any of the skin conditions that may be confused with scabies. Ask your doctor to rule out these other conditions so you can be sure you have scabies. Scabies is sometimes confused with other insect bites or stings, like bed bugs. You can identify bed bug bites by looking for red, raised bites in groups of three. It can also be confused with eczema, which is a chronic skin condition involving inflammation of the skin. The red pimple-like rash of eczema represents an allergic reaction. [7] X Trustworthy Source MedlinePlus Collection of medical information sourced from the US National Library of Medicine Go to source People with eczema can also get scabies, and the condition is typically more severe for them. You could also have folliculitis, which is an inflammation, and usually infection, in the area associated with a hair follicle. This conditions causes small white-headed pimples to crop up on a reddened base around or near hair follicles.

You can prevent scabies by staying away when you know someone is infected. In adults, scabies is often contracted through sexual activity, although it’s the skin-to-skin contact that does it, not the sex itself. [15] X Trustworthy Source Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Main public health institute for the US, run by the Dept. of Health and Human Services Go to source Crowded conditions are a common cause for scabies outbreaks. Areas like prisons, barracks, child-care and elder-care facilities, and schools are common sites.

Scabies mites can only survive for 48 to 72 hours away from human skin, which is why keeping an item in a plastic bag will kill them. The day scabies treatment is started, vacuum all carpet and furniture in your home. Throw away the bag or empty and thoroughly wash the canister after you've finished vacuuming. If the canister is not removable, wipe it clean with a damp paper towel to remove any scabies mites. Don’t worry about treating your pets. The scabies mite cannot survive on other animals, and other animals cannot transmit scabies."
