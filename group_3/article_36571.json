      "content": "Use a screwdriver to lift up the bracket on each side of the blind. Standard brackets have a piece that clips into place over the front-facing side of the blind. Starting with one of the brackets, wedge the tip of the screwdriver between the clipped piece and the blind. Then, pull the screwdriver away from the blind to release the clipped piece and open up the bracket. Repeat on the other bracket. [2] X Research source"

Then, position the drill bit in one of the screws attaching the brackets to the window and press and hold the on switch. Once you’ve unscrewed the screw and bracket, place them in a small plastic bag so you don’t lose them. Repeat with the screw on the other bracket. [4] X Research source Hold the brackets with your free hand as you're drilling so they don't fall once the screws are out."

Push in toward the window using your hands. Then, rotate the top of the blind down toward you so it releases from the bracket. You should hear a clicking noise as it releases.
