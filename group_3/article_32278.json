      "content": "Begin adding more splotches of paint across the page creating more depth with each paint stroke. There is no correct drying time, use the back of your hand to lightly touch the painting to see if it is dry. If you are unsure if you are doing it the \"correct\" way, you can always reference back to a photo. There is no real correct way of creating a watercolor galaxy; it is all about having fun."

      "content": "Continue adding colors until you have painted your desired galaxy look. If you think your painting is too light, add accent points of deep dark colors like a violet or indigo. If you think your painting is too dark, simply take a clean wet paintbrush and go over the darker colors and use a swiping motion to lift away the colors. Let your painting dry fully before continuing."

If using a toothbrush, drag your thumb across the bristles of the toothbrush above your painting, flicking the paint onto the paper.
