      "content": "Pull up next to the gas pump. When you get to the gas station, find an empty gas pump and pull up alongside it. Make sure your gas tank is on the same side as the pump. Park your car and turn off your engine before you start pumping gas. Never pump your gas while your vehicle is running since the engine could cause the gas to combust while you’re pumping."

      "title": "Estimate how much gas you need in your tank.",
      "content": "Estimate how much gas you need in your tank. Look at your gas gauge to see what you have left in your tank. Compare your gauge to the size of your fuel tank, which is usually between 10–20 US gal (38–76 L). Use estimation to guess how much gas you need to fill your tank, and then multiply that number by the price to find out how much you need to pay. [3] X Research source For example, if your tank holds 15 US gal (57 L) and it’s half full, buy about 7 1 ⁄ 2 US gal (28 L) to fill it completely."

      "title": "Pay the clerk inside for the gas before you start pumping.",
      "content": "Pay the clerk inside for the gas before you start pumping. Most gas stations require you to prepay with cash so you can’t drive away without payment. Go inside the gas station and tell the clerk the pump number and the amount of money you want to put in your tank. Give them the cash so they can activate the pump for you. [4] X Research source Some gas stations may let you pay after you pump the gas. Check the screen on the gas pump to see if you need to pay before you pump."

      "title": "Press the button to select your fuel grade.",
      "content": "Press the button to select your fuel grade. In the United States, there are usually 3 different fuel grades of unleaded gasoline to pick from. Check your vehicle’s manual to see if it requires regular, midgrade, or premium gasoline. Press the button that matches what your vehicle requires to pump that type of fuel. [5] X Trustworthy Source FuelEconomy.gov Official source for the U.S. government for fuel economy information Go to source The fuel grade refers to the octane rating of the gas, which measures the fuel’s resistance to igniting prematurely in your engine. Midgrade and premium fuel will cost more than regular gas."

      "title": "Put the fuel nozzle into your vehicle’s tank.",
      "content": "Put the fuel nozzle into your vehicle’s tank. Open the fuel cover on your vehicle and unscrew the cap from the tank. Feed the end of the nozzle into your gas tank and tilt it down until it catches inside your tank. Let go of the nozzle to see if it stays in your tank without you holding it. [6] X Research source Some gas pumps may have you lift a lever where the nozzle was before you start pumping. Follow the direction on the gas pump’s screen to see if you need to do any additional steps."

      "title": "Pull the trigger on the nozzle to start pumping.",
      "content": "Pull the trigger on the nozzle to start pumping. Once the nozzle is secure in your tank, squeeze the trigger on the handle completely to pump the gas. Keep the trigger pulled while the gas is pumping or else the flow will stop. When you reach the amount you paid for or if your tank gets full, the pump will immediately stop. When it’s finished, take the nozzle out of the tank and put it back on the pump. [7] X Research source Never smoke while you pump gas since you could ignite the gasoline. Don’t leave the pump unattended as you’re filling your tank. Avoid using electronics while you pump your gas since the electricity could spark the gasoline."

      "content": "Get your change from the clerk if you overpaid. If you filled your tank and you didn’t spend the entire amount you paid for, go back inside and talk to the clerk. Tell them which pump your vehicle is at and ask for your change. The clerk will give you the leftover change that you didn’t spend on fuel. [8] X Research source"
