Look for a mattress with medium firmness. It should be firm enough to support your joints but not so firm that it causes back pain. Try lying down on the mattress before you buy it. If you sink into the mattress, it may be too soft to support your shoulder. If the mattress puts pressure on your back or feels uncomfortable, it may be too firm. If your mattress is causing you pain, try sleeping on the floor. Some people find it easier to fall asleep on a firm surface.
