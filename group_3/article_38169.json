      "title": "İyi ki doğdun.",
      "content": "İyi ki doğdun. In Turkish the letter \"ğ\" means lengthen the o and the u and merge them into one. It doesn't have a sound of its own, though. This is pronounced eey-ki dough-doon . The oo is like the oo in book. The gh must be very soft, like the gh in \"Bread Dough\". The basic meaning of this is \"It's a good thing you were born.\" [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Mutlu yıllar.",
      "content": "Mutlu yıllar. In Turkish, the letter \"ı\" is like a cross between the u in umbrella and the oo in book. It is pronounced moot-loo yull-larr . In this one, trill the r. The oo is, again, like the oo in book. The basic meaning is \"Happy years.\" This need not necessarily be limited to birthdays, though. [2] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Doğum günün kutlu olsun.",
      "content": "Doğum günün kutlu olsun. The ü is the oo in book leaning over just a bit to sound like ee. Again, the ğ makes a soft gh sound, like the gh in Bread Dough. This is pronounced do-wum goonoon kootloo olsun. The basic meaning is \"May your birthday be celebrated.\" [3] X Research source"
