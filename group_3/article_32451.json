      "content": "Remove distractions, like your phone. One of the easiest things you can do to help yourself concentrate in class is to avoid distractions that keep you from focusing. Try to be more aware of what you’re doing when you stop paying attention. Maybe you’re scrolling on your phone or fidgeting with a pencil. Either way, put the distracting item away so you’re not tempted to focus on it. [1] X Research source Distractions could be a computer, a phone, small items you can play with, fidgets, or something around you, like a friend or a window. Physical removal is the best way to deal with a distraction. So, for example, if you know a classmate is distracting you, try sitting somewhere else. If you have a habit of using your phone, keep it in your locker."
