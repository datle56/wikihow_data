      "title": "Peel off putty type sealers.",
      "content": "Peel off putty type sealers. Putty sealers typically get molded around the base of the mold to seal the hole. They’re usually pressed into a disk and stuck to the bottom of the mold. Removing this kind of sealer is as simple as peeling it off, much like sticky tack."

      "title": "Snap off magnetic mold sealers.",
      "content": "Snap off magnetic mold sealers. Magnetic mold sealers are simple metal sheets that are magnetically charged. They snap onto the bottom of a mold to prevent wax from leaking out. Removing these is as simple as pulling them off. If you’re using plastic or aluminium molds, you’re likely not using a magnetic mold sealer."

      "title": "Pull out rubber mold plugs.",
      "content": "Pull out rubber mold plugs. Rubber mold plugs are shaped somewhat like a spinning top; they have a large base and a tapered tip. Usually they just squeeze into the hole at the bottom of a candle mold. That means removing them is as simple as grabbing the base and pulling them out. With rubber molds, the wick may be wrapped around a wick bar at the bottom of the mold. If so, you’ll need to unwrap the wick before you can remove the candle."

      "title": "Wait until the mold cools completely.",
      "content": "Wait until the mold cools completely. If you try to remove the candle before the wax has set completely, the surface of the candle might tear and crumble. Leave the mold on a flat surface that won’t be damaged while the mold is still warm. It may take some time for the mold to cool; be patient. [1] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Tap on the bottom of the mold.",
      "content": "Tap on the bottom of the mold. Flip the mold upside down, so the opening faces downwards. Use your fingers to lightly tap on the bottom of the mold, which will shake the candle loose. Tap slowly and progressively, or the candle might slip out too quickly. Don’t bang the mold against a counter or other hard surface, since this could damage the candle. [2] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Tug the wick lightly.",
      "content": "Tug the wick lightly. If tapping on the mold isn’t enough to dislodge the candle, you can gently tug on the couple of inches of wick poking out the top of the candle. Don’t use too much strength when pulling on the wick; you might break the string or cause it to slip out of the candle. [3] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Refrigerate the mold.",
      "content": "Refrigerate the mold. Placing the mold in the refrigerator will speed up the cooling process, helping the wax set and separate from the mold. Flip the mold every 30 minutes; this will make sure the mold and wax cool evenly. Check the mold periodically; you’ll want to remove it from the fridge as soon as it’s cold to the touch. Make sure you wait until the mold has cooled to room temperature before placing it in the fridge. If the temperature change is too drastic, the candle could crack."

    {
      "title": "Put the mold in the freezer for five minutes.",
      "content": "Put the mold in the freezer for five minutes. If the candle’s especially difficult to dislodge, you can try putting the mold in the freezer. Take it out after five minutes and try to remove the candle. If it still won’t budge, leave it in the freezer for an additional five minutes. You don’t want to leave the mold in any longer than 10 minutes, since this will definitely cause the candle to crack. [4] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Use boiling water to remove completely stuck candles.",
      "content": "Use boiling water to remove completely stuck candles. Finally, if you’ve tried all of the above and can’t remove the candle, you might have to cut your losses. Place the mold in a metal dish filled with boiling water and wait for the candle to soften. After a few minutes, you should be able to retrieve the candle; use a pair of tongs or a wooden spoon to avoid burning yourself. This process won’t save your candle, but you can at least melt down the wax for use in your next attempt."
