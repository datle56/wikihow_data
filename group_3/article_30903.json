      "content": "There are metal objects inside your microwave. The microwaves that cook food aren’t able to pass through metal, so they bounce off and create sparking or “arcing” inside of your appliance. This normally happens if you accidentally leave silverware or aluminum foil in your microwave, or if use cookware that has metal trim. [1] X Research source How to Fix: Take out any food and dishware and check for any scraps of foil or metal pieces, and make sure you’re using dishes that are labeled “microwave-safe” when you’re heating up your food. Other materials you should avoid using in your microwave include: [2] X Research source Gold and silver Recycled paper Pewter Skewers Twist ties Foil liners"

      "title": "The food you’re cooking has a low moisture content.",
      "content": "The food you’re cooking has a low moisture content. Moisture in your food helps absorb the microwaves so your food heats evenly. When you’re cooking food that’s really dry or has a small portion, the microwaves bounce back onto the appliance components and could cause sparks or flares. [3] X Research source How to Fix: Sprinkle your food with a few spoonfuls of water before cooking it to help absorb more of the microwaves and prevent sparking. [4] X Research source To help retain even more moisture, place a microwave cover over your food to trap the steam."

      "title": "The microwave interior is dirty.",
      "content": "The microwave interior is dirty. When food and grease build up inside of your microwave, they can start to carbonize after multiple cooking cycles. Over time, these spots can turn into hot spots in your microwave that create sparks and arcing. How to Fix: Clean the inside of your microwave. Fill a microwave-safe bowl with 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of white vinegar and 2 cups (470 ml) of water. For a fresh smell, replace the vinegar with juice from 1 lemon instead. Put the bowl in your microwave and run it for 5 minutes to help soften the residue. Let the bowl sit for 5 minutes before taking it out and wiping the inside out with a microfiber cloth. [5] X Research source If your microwave still sparks when you run it, stop it immediately. You can still use the same cleaning solution, but it’ll just take a little extra elbow grease to scrub stuck-on residue."

      "content": "The racks or shelf supports are worn down. If your microwave has a rack, the coating on the outside can start to wear away and expose metal underneath. Similarly, if the shelf supports are damaged or bent, it can expose bare metal where sparking happens. [6] X Research source Take out the rack and inspect it for any chips or damage. Then, look at the shelf supports on the sides of the microwave’s interior to see if they’re bent, broken, or deformed. How to Fix: Replace the microwave rack or shelf supports. If the rack that came with your microwave is broken or has exposed metal, you may be able to order an exact replacement from the manufacturer or a universal microwave stand . If the shelf supports are broken: Order rack supports for your microwave. Pry the old support pegs out with a screwdriver. Straighten out any dents or raised areas. Push the new supports in their place. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "The stirrer cover is damaged. The stirrer is a metal spinning piece with a cover piece at the top of the appliance that helps distribute the microwaves evenly. If the cover is broken or has damage, you may see sparking inside the microwave near the top. [8] X Research source How to Fix: Install a new stirrer cover . Use a flathead screwdriver to pry out the pegs holding the circular cover from the top inner wall of your microwave. Take the disc-shaped metal stirrer out of the old cover and place it inside the new cover. Reattach the stirrer cover to your microwave and push the pegs back into place. [9] X Research source"

      "content": "The waveguide cover is damaged. The waveguide cover sits over the opening where microwaves come into the appliance, and it’s usually a rectangular piece found on the interior right side of your microwave. If the cover gets damaged, then food can get inside or metal can be exposed, which can lead to sparks. [10] X Research source How to Fix: Insert a new waveguide cover . Unplug your microwave when you replace a waveguide cover to help prevent damage or electrical shock. Take out the tray and roller from the bottom of the microwave. Then, use your fingernails or a screwdriver to pry the old waveguide cover off. Press the new cover in its place until it's secure."

      "title": "The interior coating is chipped.",
      "content": "The interior coating is chipped. The interior paint normally covers the metal parts inside your microwave. If you accidentally chip or scratch the coating, then sparks will start to appear and radiate from the same spot each time you run your microwave. [11] X Research source How to Fix: Apply touch-up paint to a chipped interior. Touch-up paint works on spots that are about the size of a quarter or smaller. Clean any spots around the chipped paint with soapy water and then pat it dry with a lint-free cloth. Use fine-grit sandpaper to sand any burnt areas to the bare metal, and wipe it clean. Apply the touch-up paint in a thin coat and let it dry for 5 minutes. Then, apply another coat to completely cover the spot. [12] X Research source Wait 24 hours after applying touch-up paint to use your microwave again."

      "content": "The door switch is broken. The door switch is a component that only lets your microwave run when the door is completely closed. If the switch has corroded terminals or if it has any damage, then it can create sparking near the door when your microwave runs. You may also notice a burning smell if the door switch is the cause of the microwave sparking. How to Fix: Hire a technician to replace a faulty door switch. Microwaves contain high voltage even after you unplug them, so leave internal repairs to a professional. A repair technician will: Unscrew and disconnect the control panel from your microwave to access the wiring and door switch behind it. They’ll then remove the old door switch, replace it, and reconnect all the pieces together again. [13] X Research source"
