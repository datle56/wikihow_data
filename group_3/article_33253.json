You don't have to give it a name, but if you have multiple save files, having names helps to distinguish them. You can also enter a world seed. World seeds are codes that bring you to a certain map. However, you don't need to have a world seed, as any world spawned without a seed will have the necessities for a successful game."

Survival mode is when you have limited resources and can die, being attacked by monsters, falling from height, and more. The resources you do have are the ones you collect on your own with tools, and can be easily destroyed by a nearby creeper."

Certain mobs drop certain things when they are killed. For example, sheep drop wool blocks, but they do not drop any meat. Killing a cow will give you beef and leather, which can be used later. Killing a chicken will give you feather and raw meat. The feather can be used when creating an arrow ,which can be helpful. Make sure not to kill off all of the animals. You can breed them."

      "content": "Make sure you have a shelter and tools. If you plan on lasting the night, you're going to need a shelter. It doesn't have to be huge - just something that keeps the mobs out. You can only create tools with the crafting table (with some exceptions, such as torches). Tools such as pickaxes, swords, and shovels cannot be made through your inventory. For this reason, it's a good idea to carry around a spare crafting table in case your pickaxe breaks while mining. Wood and gold are the weakest materials for any tools. A wooden sword deals the least damage, and a wooden pickaxe can only harvest stone and coal ore. The best thing to do is to use a wooden pick to get cobblestone, and then use cobblestone for other things, such as swords, furnaces, and pickaxes to harvest iron."

      "content": "Fight mobs effectively. Certain mobs will be harder to fight than others, and how you fight can make it easier or harder. For mobs that can attack from a distance, such as skeletons, it's best to use a bow and arrow. If you don't have bows and arrows, a sword will work, but swords make it necessary to run around to keep from getting killed. Mobs such as spiders and zombies can be attacked easily with a sword. Zombies will slowly walk straight at you, so it's easy enough to hit them with a sword. Spiders leap at you, so make sure you're ready to fight them. Keep in mind that spiders can climb walls. If your shelter is unfinished, make sure it has a roof so that spiders can't climb in."
