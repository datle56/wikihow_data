      "content": "Confirm that the growth is a skin tag. Skin tags in dogs can be easily confused with warts, which are more dangerous because they can grow into malignant tumors. Unlike warts, though, skin tags have a narrow stalk that is attached loosely to the skin. They may be flat or teardrop-shaped, can move or dangle, and they are the same color as the dog’s skin. [1] X Research source Note that skin tags aren’t general harmful to your pup, so it’s best to leave it be if it’s fairly small or otherwise not bothering them. Did You Know? Dog skin tags originate from fibroblasts (cells in a dog that are overactive). They aren't specific to any particular dog breed or canine age group. [2] X Trustworthy Source American Kennel Club The American Kennel Club (AKC) is a purebred dog pedigree registry in the United States. The AKC advocates for the responsible ownership of dogs and promotes purebred dog events, such as the Westminster Dog Show. Go to source Some believe that friction may contribute to skin tags, too.

      "content": "Sterilize surgical scissors in a pan. Sterilize a pair of curved mayo scissors if you are going to cut the skin tag. Sterilize a piece of string or floss if you want to tie off the skin tag instead. Use any clean, shallow plastic pan (or even a lunch box) for this purpose. Place 250 mL (8.5 fl oz) of water in the pan, plus 10 mL (0.34 fl oz) of 10% povidone-iodine. Immerse the scissors in the pan for a full minute to sterilize them. [6] X Research source Using curved scissors is important, as they will help ensure that the skin tag’s stalk is cut as close to the skin as possible."

      "content": "Tie the skin tag as an alternative to snipping it off. Using the clean string, thread, or dental floss, tie around the base of the stalk as tightly as possible and as close to the skin as you can. [7] X Research source Check the area daily. The tag will swell for approximately 3 days, then it will begin to shrivel, turn dark, and fall off within a week."
