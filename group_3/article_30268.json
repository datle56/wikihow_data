      "title": "Dip a cotton swab in the lemon juice and write your message on paper.",
      "content": "Dip a cotton swab in the lemon juice and write your message on paper. Wet the end of your cotton swab and shake off the excess liquid. Use the cotton swab to leave your secret message on the paper. If the cotton swab dries out while you’re writing, just rewet it in your lemon juice. Alternatively, write your message using a toothpick, paintbrush, or calligraphy pen dipped in the lemon juice mixture instead of a cotton swab."

      "title": "Allow the invisible ink to dry for 15 minutes.",
      "content": "Allow the invisible ink to dry for 15 minutes. When the lemon juice is still wet, your message may still look slightly visible. As the invisible ink dries, anything you wrote down will disappear on the paper. [3] X Research source To make your message even more invisible, crumple up the piece of paper so the creases hide where you wrote things down."
    },
    {
      "title": "Heat the paper over a light bulb or candle to reveal the hidden message.",
      "content": "Heat the paper over a light bulb or candle to reveal the hidden message. Hold your piece of paper a few inches above a light bulb or lit candle for a few minutes. The heat from the bulb or flame causes a chemical reaction that darkens the lemon juice so you’re able to read the secret message clearly. [4] X Research source Avoid holding the paper too close to an open flame since it could catch on fire. Alternatively, put your hidden message between 2 thin towels and run an iron over it on low heat. Keep moving the iron around for a few minutes until the invisible ink reveals itself. [5] X Research source To quickly reveal your invisible ink message, set your oven to 300 °F (149 °C), and put the paper on a baking sheet. Let it heat up for 1–2 minutes until the lemon juice darkens. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Write your message with a cotton swab, and let the ink dry completely. Dip the end of a cotton swab into your baking soda invisible ink and shake off the excess. Write your message on a blank piece of white paper. If your cotton swab dries out, just dip it back in the baking soda solution. When you’re finished with your secret message, leave the paper out to dry for about 15–30 minutes so the ink is invisible. [9] X Research source If you don’t have a cotton swab, a toothpick or paintbrush will work great for writing your message."

Lightly spread the grape juice over the piece of paper and wait for your invisible ink message to appear. [10] X Research source Grape juice has a natural pigment called anthocyanin, which darkens the color of the baking soda because of the change in pH. Alternatively, mix 1 teaspoon (5 g) of turmeric with 1 ⁄ 2 cup (120 ml) of rubbing alcohol. Apply the solution to have your invisible ink message turn red. [11] X Research source"

      "content": "Hold the paper over a heat source to reveal the invisible ink. Keep the piece of paper a few inches above a lit light bulb or a candle. [14] X Research source Because milk burns at a lower temperature than the paper, your message will darken so you’re able to read it. [15] X Research source Try putting the paper between 2 towels and running an iron on low heat over your message. Within a few minutes, the message will reveal itself. Avoid touching the paper to the candle or it could catch fire."

      "title": "Paint over the message with watercolor paints to reveal the message.",
      "content": "Paint over the message with watercolor paints to reveal the message. Wet a paintbrush in water and then dab a little paint onto the bristles. Spread the paint across the sheet of paper in a thin, even layer. The paint will stick to the paper but not to the white crayon wax, so your secret message will stand out from the background. [19] X Research source Alternatively, color over the paper with a dark-colored marker. You may be able to see the message by holding the paper at a slight slant next to a bright window.
