      "content": "Draw a line where you want to cut. Use a straight edge from a yardstick or triangle to help you draw the line that will designate where you want to cut. Having a line to guide you will assist in sawing straight. [3] X Research source You can also use the flat side of your saw to draw a straight line."

      "content": "Clamp a straight board onto the wood. Use a piece of lumber or plywood with a straight edge and lay it over the piece of wood that you want to cut. Clamp the board so that the edge of the wood lines up with the line you drew. This is sometimes referred to as a jig. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Put the saw blade on the line at a 45-degree angle.",
      "content": "Put the saw blade on the line at a 45-degree angle. Grip the saw’s handle while keeping your index finger resting on the side of the saw so you have more control over it. Your wrist, elbow, and shoulder should be aligned with the blade. Brace yourself with your free hand, making sure to keep it away from the saw. Place the saw on the line, making sure that your jig is against the side of your saw. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Work the saw back and forth to cut the wood. Continue moving your hand back and forth in full strokes and cut along the line that you created. If you are making a cross cut or a cut against the grain, cut the wood at a 45-degree angle. If you are making a rip cut or a cut with the grain, hold the saw at a 60-degree angle instead.

      "content": "Use a miter box. A miter box is a tool that you can purchase online or at hardware stores. A miter box is made of a handsaw and a box that has differently angled slits. Clamp your piece of wood to the miter box before you start cutting. Then, put the saw in between the slits and use the box to keep your cuts straight. Most miter boxes will have slits that are at different angles in case you need to cut your wood on an angle."

Hold a drafting triangle up against the miter gauge and make sure that the saw blade is resting on the other edge of the triangle. If it doesn’t alight perfectly, loosen the miter gauge handle and adjust it until the triangle can sit at a perfect 90-degree angle. [9] X Research source"

If you notice that the board doesn’t lie flat on the fence, the board is most likely bent or warped. Tighten the fence once it’s in the right position and prepare to cut the board.

      "content": "Set up an outfeed table. If you are sawing longer boards, they will need additional support if your table isn’t long enough. You can create your own outfeed table by clamping two 2x4-inch (5.08x10.16 cm) 8-foot long (2.43 m) boards on each side of the saw, so that they hang several feet over the edge of the table. Measure the distance between the boards and clamp a piece of plywood under them, where they are hanging off the table. This will extend the length of the table saw and allow you to make straighter cuts on longer boards. [11] X Research source"
