[4] X Research source Write down a list from 1-10, 1 being the situation that would bring you the least amount of fear (such as thinking about spiders), and 10 being the situation that would bring you the most amount of fear (touching a spider). Work your way up the ladder by first becoming comfortable with number 1 by thinking about spiders gradually until you have little to no fear thinking about spiders, and then move on to number 2, and so on until you have reached your number 10 item. Make sure you have adequate support throughout each of the steps. An example of an exposure hierarchy might be: 1. Look at spider pictures 2. Watch videos of spiders 3. Hold a toy spider 4. Visit a spider exhibit at the zoo 5. Go outside and look for spiders 6. Capture a spider and watch it 7. Visit a friend with a pet spider 8. Look at the spider with the top off (if safe of course) 9. Watch the friend feed the spider 10. Watch the friend handle the spider It's okay to start small. That's why you built your fear hierarchy. Rate your anxiety level from 1-10 (1 being least amount of anxiety, 10 being extremely high anxiety) throughout your engagement in exposure. If you find yourself becoming increasingly anxious, it may be time to go down a step (redo the previous step) or stop exposure for a brief time. If you become too anxious and do not seem to get relief even with prolonged exposure, it could make your fear worse. Be careful and seek consultation with a mental health professional."

There are several types of therapy that help individuals with spider phobias. The most common is Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, which can include Exposure and Systematic Desensitization. [13] X Trustworthy Source Simply Psychology Popular site for evidence-based psychology information Go to source Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) involves restructuring your thinking (about spiders) in order to change your feelings (fear) and behaviors (avoidance of spiders). CBT can be especially helpful in replacing the thoughts that reinforce your fear of spiders. For example, instead of thinking, \"That spider is going to hurt me,\" you could think, \"That spider is not worried about me. It is harmless.\" A therapist can help you with this process so that you can begin to use CBT on your own in order to challenge your automatic thoughts. While exposure is the most research-based psychotherapy for phobias, alternative treatments are: biofeedback, learning relaxation skills, meditation, mindfulness, and distress tolerance.

A fear of spiders can be a conditioned response meaning that you encountered a negative situation associated with a spider and then developed a fearful reaction to spiders. [18] X Research source Try to figure out why you're afraid of spiders or what it is about them that makes them scary to you. Once you understand your specific fear-related thoughts you can begin changing them into more positive realities. Talk to a trustworthy friend, family member, or therapist and have them help you understand your specific reason for fearing spiders. Did a spider crawl on you when you were younger? Did you hear a story about a spider killing someone? Did you think yourself into hating them? Remember when it first started and you can work from there. Determining the origin of fears can be challenging at times, but it can be helpful to perform a careful assessment that involves when the fear began, the context and variables involved in the development of the learned fear response, and mechanisms that have reinforced the fear over time, such as avoidant behaviors."

Changing your thinking about spiders is crucial to overcoming your fear and may help you feel more comfortable when seeing a spider.

Other areas of the world have more risky varieties. For those that may be harmful, there is almost always a cure at your local hospital. Understand that spiders are more helpful than harmful, and help protect you by eliminating pests that may spread greater dangers like a disease. Understand that for spiders, a bite is a last defensive resort. Try watching little children movies or reading little children's storybooks on spiders. Take the time out to appreciate the beauty of these creatures, watch documentaries and learn more about them. Draw a happy, non-threatening spider on a piece of paper. Imagine it wants you to be its friend. Talk to the paper spider and ask the imaginary happy spider questions that you know the answer to but pretend it's telling you.
