Asking questions isn’t just a good way to check in with your partner—it’s also helpful for understanding what you yourself are looking for in a relationship and assessing how things are going with your current partner.

Do I enjoy spending time with their friends? Do I enjoy spending time with their family? How do I feel about their financial situation? How do I feel when my partner arrives home after they’ve been away for a while? Have I made personal sacrifices to make this relationship work? If yes, have they been worth it? Have they been reciprocated? When was the last time I told them I loved them? If it’s been a while, why? When was the last time they told me they loved me? How do I feel about the answer?

      "content": "Asking a new partner questions can help you see if you’re compatible. Asking questions about a new partner’s dating history, expectations for the relationship, values and beliefs, and future goals is a good way to help you “establish common ground…in regards to what you're looking for,” says Sanders: “I find that with my clients that do actually end up being in a relationship…they do have common goals for the future.” You might have amazing chemistry and enjoy spending time together, but if there are any major dealbreakers, it’s worth it to ask yourself if you should continue dating. For instance, if you really want to have kids someday and your partner doesn’t, this might be a dealbreaker you can’t overcome, even if you get along great otherwise. But asking questions about your partner’s favorite movies and books, favorite things to do in their spare time, and ideal date nights are also fun ways to learn what you have in common and give you plenty to talk about and do together."

      "content": "Asking questions can help keep your bond strong. Asking questions is an opportunity to address any issues in the relationship that may currently be unresolved. As Quinlan notes, “Asking about future goals in life [will help you] make sure that you guys are aligned as far as what your goals are: are they similar, are they really far apart? And if they are far apart, what can you guys do to get them where they need to be?” “Sometimes couples don't communicate, and communication is key to any good relationship,” Quinlan stresses. “Just being able to have open honest communication about where you stand, where you see things in the future, and working together to make those dreams come true or if they're just too far apart” can help you patch up any problems or give you both a chance to reassess the relationship."
