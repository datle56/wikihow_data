      "title": "Take over-the-counter pain relievers if your blood pressure is within normal limits.",
      "content": "Take over-the-counter pain relievers if your blood pressure is within normal limits. Either ibuprofen or acetaminophen are good options and readily available at any pharmacy. As soon as you feel a headache developing, take the maximum dosage allowed on the label. Then, repeat the dosage, as directed, until the pain subsides. Experiment with various OTC medications to see which one works the best for you. [2] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Family Physicians Organization devoted to improving the health of patients, families, and communities Go to source Some evidence shows that ibuprofen relieves tension headaches faster than acetaminophen. If you find yourself taking OTC medications almost every day, talk with your doctor about other options. Too frequent use of OTC pain meds can actually cause an uptick in headaches.

      "content": "Take a dose of triptan medication at the first sign of a headache. This is a prescription medication that helps to shrink blood vessels, which can lower your pain level during a headache.

      "content": "Lie down in a dark room and close your eyes. Sometimes simply removing yourself from your surroundings by feigning sleep can help to lower your blood pressure and reduce headache pain. Lie down on a bed, couch, or even on the floor (in a safe space). Close your eyes gently without clenching them and take deep breaths in and out."

      "content": "Seek emergency care for chest pains, nausea, or distorted vision. These are all signs that your blood pressure has risen to the point that it might be impacting the blood flow to your head. If you undergo a hypertensive crisis, then over-the-counter pain relievers, such as ibuprofen, will not work. [5] X Research source In some cases, you may need to be monitored until the crisis is over and your blood pressure has leveled out."

      "content": "Go for brisk walks at least 3 times a week. Head out in your neighborhood or hop onto the treadmill at the gym for a 30-minute walk. Go at a moderate-intense pace where you can barely talk or hold a conversation. Walking on a regular basis helps to increase blood flow to the brain and can also improve your blood oxygen levels, which can reduce the possibility of headaches. [6] X Research source There is also some evidence showing that walking as soon as you experience headache pains may also reduce the duration of the headache. However, just make sure that you are not experiencing dizziness if you decide to try this out."

Try to incorporate cantaloupe, melon, raisins, peas, and even potatoes into your daily diet. If you are worried about your levels, you can also talk with your doctor about taking a daily supplement or multivitamin.

      "content": "Get treatment for sleep apnea if you suffer from early morning headaches. Snoring or restless nights can be a sign of sleep apnea, a condition which, if left untreated, can seriously elevate your blood pressure. Talk with your doctor about signing up for a sleep study. And, if you are diagnosed with sleep apnea, consider lifestyle changes, medication options, or even sleeping with a breathing mask. [9] X Research source Sleep apnea boosts the levels of the hormone aldosterone, which can contribute to high blood pressure."

      "content": "Meet with a therapist for cognitive therapy. Get a referral from your doctor for a therapist and begin to schedule regular appointments. At these meetings, you’ll work through your thoughts to see what mental processes might play a part in triggering or feeding your headaches. A big part of cognitive therapy is moving away from negative thoughts and focusing on the positive. [10] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Family Physicians Organization devoted to improving the health of patients, families, and communities Go to source For example, if you tend to get hypertension headaches immediately before social gatherings, it could have something to do with an anxiety or fear of interaction."

After that period, you can usually see benefits with only 1 visit per week. [11] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source The pain with acupuncture is usually minimal. If you feel any discomfort during the process, tell your therapist and they will make adjustments."

Then, work with them to develop an exercise and massage program to boost your overall wellness. Some therapists may also suggest a routine of applying ice packs before or after exercise. [12] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Family Physicians Organization devoted to improving the health of patients, families, and communities Go to source This may seem unrelated, but improving circulation and blood flow is an important part of minimizing hypertension headaches."
