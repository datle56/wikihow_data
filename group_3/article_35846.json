      "content": "Relationship anxiety stems from a lack of trust and commitment fears. Maybe you’ve been cheated on before, never seen a healthy relationship last, or were abandoned as a child. Either way, if you have relationship anxiety, you probably have trauma or unresolved conflicts from your upbringing or previous relationships. These experiences have left you vulnerable and insecure, causing you to second guess your worth within the relationship.

      "content": "Relationship anxiety can cause insecurities and controlling behavior. Along with anxious feelings, relationship anxiety can lead to other negative reactions, such as depression, an inability to focus, a lack of confidence, and confrontational behavior. Constantly worrying about the strength or serenity of a relationship may make you more controlling over your partner. This often results in an ambivalent or anxious-preoccupied attachment style.

      "title": "A gut feeling is an immediate reaction to a current situation.",
      "content": "A gut feeling is an immediate reaction to a current situation. Also known as gut instinct or intuition, this feeling is often associated with nerves, a falling stomach, or butterflies. Feeling something in your gut is completely normal; it’s part of your flight or fight response. The feeling doesn’t typically last very long and usually follows an instinctual thought. To put it simply, a gut feeling is a hunch. [4] X Research source For instance, imagine you’re on a date, and they say something you strongly disagree with. As your mind shouts, “Retreat! Retreat!” your gut may suddenly feel heavy or like it’s doing somersaults. If someone says, “I have a bad feeling about this,” they’re most likely explaining a gut feeling or instinct. Gut instincts rely on the present situation and past experiences. Similarly to relationship anxiety, your instinct might be to hesitate when trusting someone because you’ve been cheated on before. [5] X Research source Unlike relationship anxiety, gut feelings are fueled by self-preservation, not insecurity."

      "title": "Trust your instincts when they don't stem from fear or self-doubt.",
      "content": "Trust your instincts when they don't stem from fear or self-doubt. First impressions are important, especially when it comes to relationships. If you go on a date and feel a sense of dread or fear, take it as a hint not to schedule a second date. If you’re in a committed relationship and have a hunch that they’re hiding something, look into it. More often than not, your gut instinct is right. [6] X Research source Keep in mind that your emotional intelligence (EQ) can play a big part in gut instincts. EQ is the measure of your ability to understand and manage emotions in positive ways. Lower EQs can sway judgment and overall health. [7] X Trustworthy Source HelpGuide Nonprofit organization dedicated to providing free, evidence-based mental health and wellness resources. Go to source Improve your EQ by managing stress, becoming aware of your emotions (both good and bad), and expressing your feelings mindfully. So, how do you know if it’s instincts or relationship anxiety? If you’re feeling dread and a combination of fear and self-doubt, it’s most likely your insecurities and anxieties talking. Understand that relationship anxiety can muddle instincts. Insecurities and fears of commitment could result in overreactions, causing you to jump to conclusions."

Open up to your partner, friends, or family—you don’t have to go through this alone. Discussing your worries and fears can help you overcome them and feel understood.
