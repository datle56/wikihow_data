You'll need to go in from the side and place your hand between the dog's front legs.

However, you can place one arm underneath the rump, and one arm around the torso, pulling the pup towards your body once you have it at chest height. Hold the puppy close to your body, not out away from you, as it can wriggle out of your arms. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Never grab a pup by its neck or tail. While you may know not to yank on a pup's tail or pick it up that way, you should also not do that with the puppy's neck, even if you're holding it by the scruff. You could injure or even kill the puppy. Also, don't try to pick up the dog by a leg, as you could hurt the leg.

      "content": "Sit down with your pup in your lap. One good way to start getting your puppy used to you is to sit on the floor and place the puppy in your lap. If you can't sit on the floor, sit in a chair, and place the puppy in your lap. [6] X Research source Try to hold on to the collar so he doesn't run away. You can simply put a finger in the collar."

      "title": "Soothe the puppy.",
      "content": "Soothe the puppy. Rub the puppy's head. Use gentle, soft strokes, running all along the pup's head. In addition, gently rub his chest. Another good place to rub is at the base of his ears. [7] X Research source You can also talk to your pup in a soothing tone, telling it all is well, and that it is safe and comfortable. Continue your soothing patting and talking until the puppy is completely relaxed."

      "title": "Turn him over on his back.",
      "content": "Turn him over on his back. Once your puppy is relaxed, you can turn him on his back, still in your lap. Gently rub his belly in circular motions, making sure to not be too rough. You can also rub where the thigh meets the tummy. [8] X Research source Start with short sessions first, under five minutes. Get your puppy used to it. After your puppy can relax, make the time it spends in your lap longer each time. Never force the puppy to lay on his back. If he is squirming, he's most likely uncomfortable. If this happens, allow the puppy to change his position."

      "content": "Have other people pick it up. You don't want to only socialize the puppy with you. You need to also socialize it with other members of the family. Additionally, try having anyone who visits the house socialize with your pup by picking it up and holding it for a few minutes. Teach them how to soothe the puppy, so it will feel safe in the person's arms. Socializing your dog with a variety of people will help when you take the puppy out in public, as it won't be as wary of strangers. Also, it helps when you go to the vet, as your pup will be accustomed to being restrained by strangers."

Therefore, if your pup struggles during a cuddle session, hold on. Place his back to your stomach, where the pup cannot bite you in the face. Have a hand on his stomach, pressing it up to you and another hand on the collar. [9] X Research source Hold the pup in this position until it calms down, then try petting it again. However, you may not want to put friends or family who visit through a struggling pup."

      "content": "Try kibble. Another way to help encourage socialization is to use food. When it's time for the pup's meal, have someone touch an ear or a paw, for instance, then give the pup a piece of its food. The pup will associate the touching with positive reinforcement."

If you can fit it in your car, you can use a crate that you plan to crate your puppy in at home. If not, consider a smaller carrier to help keep your puppy safe. [11] X Research source Have a towel or blanket in the carrier for your puppy. It can help the pup feel more comfortable, though be aware that it may use the bathroom on the way home."

      "content": "Secure the carrier. For a small carrier, your best option is to set it on the floor behind your seat, as buckling the carrier in could cause problems in a crash. If the carrier is larger, then place it in the back seat. The back of an SUV is not a great option, since that area is often considered a \"crumple zone\" in a crash, meaning it is the area that designers allow to crumple for the purpose of protecting passengers."

That way, you protect both your new puppy and your home. [16] X Research source For instance, you can start by sectioning off where the dog will be at first, using baby gates. You may not want a puppy in carpeted areas, for instance, as you'll need to potty train it. Move any dangerous items out of the area. Take out any chemicals the puppy could get into or put them up high. Take out plants, rugs, and anything else the puppy could destroy or be harmed by.

You don't want one person saying \"Sit!\" and another person saying \"Butt Down!\" for the same action because that's just confusing for the dog.
