      "content": "Apply vegetable oil, baby oil, or cooking spray to your skin. First, soak a cotton ball in the oil of your choice. Then, use the cotton ball to liberally dab your skin with the oil. For tough areas, use a rag, a fingernail brush , or a toothbrush. Rinse with soap and warm water to remove any remaining residue. [1] X Expert Source James Guth Painting Specialist Expert Interview. 21 July 2020. If you use cooking spray, spray it directly onto your skin rather than on a cotton ball."

      "title": "Rinse the fabric with water.",
      "content": "Rinse the fabric with water. It’s easier to remove spray paint from fabric if you can treat it while it’s still wet. Hold the fabric under cold water until it runs clear, or if you’re dealing with carpet or upholstery, blot the affected area with a cold, damp cloth or towel. [3] X Research source If you’ve simply dusted the fabric with spray paint or if the paint has dried, you can skip this step and start cleaning it."

      "title": "Spray the stain with an alcohol-based cleaner.",
      "content": "Spray the stain with an alcohol-based cleaner. Alcohol breaks down the paint’s bonds, so try rubbing alcohol or hairspray. If you don’t have an alcohol-based cleaner, acetone is another good option. Test by applying the cleaner to an inconspicuous area, then spray the affected area. [4] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Blot the area with a rag.",
      "content": "Blot the area with a rag. Once you’ve saturated the area with an alcohol-based cleaner, blot the area instead of scrubbing it. This will help prevent the stain from spreading. You should start to see some of the pigment transfer from the fabric to the cloth. The process may need to be repeated for thick layers of paint. [5] X Research source If you’re dealing with carpet or upholstery, keep spraying and rubbing until you’ve removed the stain and dried the fabric."

Then, apply a pre-wash stain remover, and run it through the washing machine on a cool setting. Don’t put paint-stained clothes in the wash with other items. This helps you avoid staining clean clothes. [6] X Research source Be sure to use a cool setting, since warm or hot water will set the stain. If this doesn’t remove the stain, let the garment air dry, then repeat the spraying, blotting, and washing process. If repeating the process doesn’t work, take the garment to your professional dry cleaner."
