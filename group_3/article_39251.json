If you are connecting a modem to the host computer via Ethernet, it will need two Ethernet ports (one to connect to the modem, and the other to connect to the hub or router). Connect the host computer to the WAN port of a wired hub or wireless router using an Ethernet cable. Connect the other computers to the hub or router using Ethernet or a wireless signal.
