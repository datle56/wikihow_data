      "content": "Sagittariuses are born between November 22 and December 21. They’re symbolized by the centaur drawing a bow but are usually represented simply as an archer. They are a mutable fire sign, which means they typically go with the flow and are open-minded. As a fire sign, a Sagittarius is also known for his passionate energy and enthusiasm, like fellow fire signs, Leo and Aries. They are ruled by Jupiter, which is associated with luck, optimism, and wisdom. [1] X Research source Birthstone: Turquoise or Topaz. Flower: Carnation. Colors: Purple, yellow, orange, and blue. Lucky numbers: 3, 7, 9, 12, and 21."

      "title": "He has a sense of adventure.",
      "content": "He has a sense of adventure. Sagittarius men love a good challenge, whether relating to work, a hobby, or a person they’re interested in. They’re looking for something new and exciting, even if it proves challenging to his current situation. His sense of adventure doesn’t just have to include the physical kind; they’re just as interested in new emotional and mental adventures."
    },
    {
      "title": "He cherishes freedom and flexibility.",
      "content": "He cherishes freedom and flexibility. A male Sagittarius hates feeling trapped; instead, he wants to know that he can leave anytime. This doesn’t always bode well where relationships are concerned, but a Sag man appreciates his independence, whether in work or love. He doesn’t like having to be forced to do anything, from pretending to like someone to taking out the garbage."
    },
    {
      "title": "He’s great at conversation.",
      "content": "He’s great at conversation. If you want to enjoy a multi-faceted, meaningful, yet easy going conversation, talk to a Sagittarius man. They’re naturals at the art of the chat and can express deep thoughts while entertaining whoever is lucky enough to talk to them. Small talk with a Sagittarius is a conversation you’ll remember long after it’s over. [2] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "He’s known for having tons of energy.",
      "content": "He’s known for having tons of energy. As a fire sign that is ruled by Jupiter, a Sagittarius guy is passionate and enthusiastic about whatever he enjoys most in life; it could be a person, a life goal, or a sport. They also apply this energy to themselves when it comes to self-discovery and personal growth, which they might express by taking a class or workshop or spending time invested in self-care."
    },
    {
      "title": "He’s a deep thinker.",
      "content": "He’s a deep thinker. A Sagittarius man adores wisdom and knowledge but doesn’t come across as pretentious about it. He thinks clearly and logically about whatever is on his mind and uses a big-picture approach for most subjects. This may have to do with Sagittarius’s original symbol of a centaur, which represented intellectual thought in ancient Rome. [3] X Research source Topaz notes that “Sagittarius men love philosophical debates and teaching others, so engaging them in deep conversations can be very attractive to them. They are into expansion, so anything that allows them to expand their mind, their vision, and see things from a bigger perspective is appealing to them.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "He’s an eternal optimist.",
      "content": "He’s an eternal optimist. No matter what he’s going through, the male Sagittarius is open-minded about his future and thinks the best of what is to come. He is excited about whatever possibilities lie ahead and is willing to do whatever it takes to get there."
    },
    {
      "title": "He can be narcissistic.",
      "content": "He can be narcissistic. A Sagittarius man enjoys having his ego fed and attended to, which is one of his weaknesses . He needs praise and admiration from those around him regularly, and not just from whoever he’s dating. Whether he’s earned the praise or not, he expects to receive it so he feels properly appreciated."
    },
    {
      "title": "He can be overly blunt.",
      "content": "He can be overly blunt. When you’re talking to a male Sagittarius, beware of the sometimes brutal honesty that might come out of his mouth. He’s not likely to have (or use) a filter in conversation, whether you’re his partner, friend, or work associate. He’s not trying to be hurtful but doesn’t see his honesty as anything but necessary."
    },
    {
      "title": "He’s not great at compromise.",
      "content": "He’s not great at compromise. Because a Sagittarius is so focused on his own path and a sense of what’s right, he’s not super willing to compromise about most anything. It could concern everything from a major life choice like where to live or what to eat for dinner. When he thinks he knows what he’s doing, it’s very difficult to get him to shift gears."
    },
    {
      "title": "He can be impatient.",
      "content": "He can be impatient. He’s always looking for a new adventure, so being patient about smaller details isn’t his strong suit. This can lead to a Sag man displaying impulsive behaviors or even having a bad temper at times. The need to take action can overtake all his other impulses, which isn’t easy when you’re in a romantic relationship with him."
    },
    {
      "title": "He’s not known for being reliable.",
      "content": "He’s not known for being reliable. Being consistent with anything is hard for any Sagittarius, so a Sag guy may not come across as super trustworthy when you need him to be. It’s better when he doesn’t over-promise, so he doesn’t end up letting others down. He’s easily bothered when things don’t go his way, so he’s not always able to stick around for others when they need him. [4] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "He’s playful and flirtatious.",
      "content": "He’s playful and flirtatious. When you get involved with a Sag man, you’re in for a fun ride. He’s also open-minded and a flirt, but keep in mind that he likes being in control. None of his relationships are the same, but by understanding the romantic and realistic aspects of love, he can act out both parts equally. For example, he may act overly romantic about going on dates but also cherish time spent together in your pajamas watching movies or dealing with household chores; he’s able to blend lovey-dovey elements of a relationship with the realities of the everyday."
    },
    {
      "title": "He wants someone who also needs new experiences.",
      "content": "He wants someone who also needs new experiences. A Sagittarius man is looking for partners who share a similar sense of adventure as he does. He’s impulsive, so he needs someone by his side with a real zeal for all the things that life has to offer. This may include travelling, work, or just how he spends his weekend. Have these qualities and a Sagittarius man will chase you until he gets to know you better. [5] X Research source You don’t have to be a world traveler to attract a Sagittarius man—if you’re boldly pursuing a new career path, course of study, or favorite hobby, he’ll consider you to be just as adventurous as he is."
    },
    {
      "title": "He’s not jealous or possessive.",
      "content": "He’s not jealous or possessive. He won’t be clingy (ever) because he loves his own independence so much. However, understand that he expects the same courtesy from his partner. Try and force him into anything or keep tabs on his behavior, and you’ll be on his bad side quickly. As long as he and his partner both share a sense of autonomy, a relationship can flourish. A Sagittarius won’t love it if you enjoy your freedoms but are clingy and possessive when it comes to his. This includes things like always keeping tabs on him by texting constantly or following his every move on social media. Give him the space to breathe he gives to you, and he’ll appreciate you even more."
    },
    {
      "title": "He often has a fear of commitment.",
      "content": "He often has a fear of commitment. It can be difficult for a Sagittarius male to completely commit, because it often conflicts with his sense of independence. While he’s great to date or have a casual affair with, it can be more challenging to have a full-on committed relationship with a Sagittarius man. Use honesty to talk about committing to a relationship with a Sagittarius; if you’re already in one, be blunt and honest about asking him to do things as long as you make him aware it’s his choice. Trying to be controlling only pushes a Sag man away, so take care to tread carefully when Eyedealism emphasizes that Sagittarius men “have a real need for freedom and space. They're always running away and need space. If they come closer, and engage in intimacy and stick around, that's a big thing for Sagittarius men, but the second you become controlling, and you want this or that from them, they'll take off.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "He doesn’t express affection well.",
      "content": "He doesn’t express affection well. Once a Sag guy is serious and committed, he’s loyal, thoughtful, and charming to his partner. He may not always express himself that way, though. A Sagittarius male is more likely to do something nice for you when you’re feeling down than go out and buy you flowers or be affectionate in public. If you want to tell him what’s bothering you, he may not always be ready to listen; if you’re not confrontational about it, you can get him to understand what’s going on by being honest. For example, if you lost your favorite umbrella, he’s likely to buy you the very same one the next day (or the same day). When it comes to telling you how much he loves you, he’s better at demonstrating it than talking about it."
    },
    {
      "title": "He’s looking for a fearless, honest, and charismatic partner.",
      "content": "He’s looking for a fearless, honest, and charismatic partner. A Sagittarius man doesn’t have time for insecure, clingy, or overly introverted partners. He needs someone comfortable in his own skin (even if he prefers one-on-one socializing over big crowds). Honesty is so important to Sag men that he has no time for those who need to play games or tell half-truths. If you’re worried about something in the relationship, sit down and talk to him openly about it. Don’t play games, give him the silent treatment, or hope that he figures it out. Let him know what’s on your mind. He’ll appreciate your honesty and strength as a partner in getting to the heart of the problem."
    },
    {
      "title": "He’s self-assured and open-minded in the bedroom.",
      "content": "He’s self-assured and open-minded in the bedroom. A Sag man is a fun, spontaneous type who proves his fiery nature when it comes to physical intimacy. He’s not afraid to be bold sexually and is great about trying new things that his partner may be interested in. He has few to no inhibitions in the bedroom and is one of the most imaginative partners you could have. He’s perfectly willing to explore new territory, as long as he knows you want to as well."
    },
    {
      "title": "He’s attracted to a partner who makes the first move.",
      "content": "He’s attracted to a partner who makes the first move. While a Sagittarius man loves being in control, he’s equally ok with letting go if his partner wants to take over. If he trusts them, he’s willing to be open-minded about what you want, too. He appreciated bravery and straightforwardness in life and in the bedroom. Topaz agrees that “Sagittarius men do tend to like a woman who has a bit more fire or a woman who is comfortable being led toward spontaneous activities.”"

    {
      "title": "Physical intimacy and affection is important to him.",
      "content": "Physical intimacy and affection is important to him. A physical relationship is a central part of being involved with a Sagittarius, whether he’s casually dating or fully committed to his partner. He always tries to make time for physical intimacy and wouldn’t be comfortable in a relationship without it. He’s not as focused on foreplay. Sex with a Sagittarius man can border on the rough and ready and feel mechanical at times. He’s not as concerned with being intimate as he is with the physical aspects, but that doesn’t mean he’s not the dynamic lover that his sign promises him to be. [6] X Research source"
