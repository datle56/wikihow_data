      "content": "Warm up your voice always . Trying to rip a scream with vocal folds that aren't properly prepared can leave you feeling raspy. Pushing your voice beyond what it is ready to do can lead to swelling and even damage, much like an athlete stands a much greater chance of injury when forgoing a pre-game warm-up. [1] X Research source [2] X Research source There are many warm ups you might use, including: Regular scales at two octave intervals. Sing regular intervals from low in your range up two octaves and back down again. You can check your intervals by playing along with a piano; each white note step is corresponds with a one-interval step. Sing trills. This will warm up the muscles of your tongue and lips. Simple sing or hum a tone while you trill your tongue or lips. For your tongue, this will be a rolled sound like the 't' in 'water' or a Spanish 'rr.' Lip trills are like blowing a raspberry. Siren up and down. Use a vowel to gently ascend from your lower range all the way up to the your upper limits. Then descend in a controlled fashion, as smoothly as possible."

      "content": "Avoid unpleasant sensations. While a certain level of fatigue is normal when training your voice to sing a broader range or in a different fashion, as you are in scream-singing, you should listen to your body. If you feel pain, irritation, a burning sensation, or notice uncharacteristic changes to your voice, stop immediately. Pushing your voice can result in permanent damage. Long periods of rest can cure fatigue and minor strain. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Take breaks for your voice frequently. The strain you put on your voice while training it to scream-sing can lead to hoarseness and discomfort, but the same sensations can come about from normal intensive vocal practice. [4] X Research source You should break up your practice sessions so that you're not overly straining your voice and doing potential damage to it. Hydration is important for the health of your vocal folds. Use breaks to grab a drink of warm water or tea. Beginning singers will want to limit singing to about 20 minutes per day. With experience will come greater vocal strength which will translate to more practice time throughout the day. Even advanced singers should limit practice to several 15 - 20 minute segments. Each segment should start with a warm up, end with a cool down, and be followed by rest, and hydration. [5] X Research source"

You should also see a vocal professional if you experience vocal discomfort or an uncharacteristic change in your voice for an extended period of time.

The upward shift of the back, upper regions of your throat is your soft palate raising. Your tongue should also be flat and somewhat retracted to improve the openness of your throat. Try breathing in on a 'k' sound. This will cause a greater space between the back regions of your tongue and your soft palate, helping you to feel the ideal shape for your throat."

[8] X Research source [9] X Research source Female vocalists attempting to accomplish this technique should practice by aiming for a tone at around B♭4, or middle the B♭ above middle C on a keyboard. Male vocalists can practice this kind of voice by singing lower in the register, at about the range of D4 - E♭4, or the D - E♭ above middle C on a keyboard."

Another technique, steaming, can be used to improve your vocal healing. Boil water in a pot, drape a towel over your head, and use the towel to collect the steam and breath it in. Be careful not to put your head to close to the boiling water, or you may get scalded. Add a few drops of Eucalyptus essential oil to your water when steaming to improve the healing effects of your steam treatment. [10] X Research source"
