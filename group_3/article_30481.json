Any massage oil, lotion, or sports balm will help break down knots and loosen your muscles. To apply massage oil, just place a drop of the oil in the palm of one hand and rub your hands together for at least fifteen seconds, until you've heated up the oil."

      "title": "Massage your lower back with a foam roller to loosen up sore muscles.",
      "content": "Massage your lower back with a foam roller to loosen up sore muscles. You can wear clothes for this. A foam roller will work best, but you can also roll up a large blanket, towel, or yoga mat in a pinch. Place the roller on the floor and lay face up on the roller. Position your lower back over the roller so that your shoulders and butt are touching the floor and you're perpendicular to the roller. Use your feet to help you move up and down the roller slowly, feeling the roller move up and down each of your vertebrae. Gently roll up or down the roller until you find a trigger point or a painful area. Then, stay rolled over the area for at least 30 seconds. This will hurt a bit, but it will relieve the tension from the area afterwards. To target smaller areas of your back, use a rolling pin instead of a blanket."
