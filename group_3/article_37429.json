      "content": "Decide how you feel about your ex and whether it's a good idea to reply. Take a “relationship inventory” of what went well, what didn’t go well, and the reasons you broke up. [1] X Research source We tend to look back on relationships through rose-colored glasses, so balancing out positive and negative memories can give you better judgment. [2] X Research source To figure out whether you should respond, ask yourself these questions: Did ending the relationship happen suddenly, or was it a long time coming? If you saw the breakup coming, it’s probably best to ignore the text. [3] X Research source Is your life better, worse, or unchanged post-breakup? If you feel relieved, free, or happier post-breakup, you might not want to respond to the message. Did your ex treat you well? If the relationship was unhealthy, just don’t respond to the message."

      "content": "Taking a step back can help you process your emotions. Getting back in touch with an ex can bring up a ton of different emotions, and you might need some time to sort out your feelings. Try drafting a message or two as an exercise to express how you feel—without hitting send. Wait a few hours or a day, then read over what you wrote. [4] X Research source For instance, you might be really tempted to respond with something like, “I miss you and I wish we were back together.” However, it’s probably better to hold off on sending that message until you’ve figured out what your ex wants and whether they have good intentions."

      "title": "What does it actually mean when your ex says \"I love you?\"",
      "content": "What does it actually mean when your ex says \"I love you?\" An “I love you” text from your ex could mean they want to get back together. Or, it could mean that they’re lonely, bored, looking to hook up, or worried they won't be able to find love in the future. You’re less likely to end up hurt if you understand why they’re contacting you from the start. “Hey, it’s good to hear from you. Can I ask why you’re reaching out now?” “I know you seemed really certain when you ended things between us. Why are you telling me this now?” “What do you mean when you say that?”"

      "title": "If your ex really does love you, they’ll show you they’re sincere.",
      "content": "If your ex really does love you, they’ll show you they’re sincere. Has your ex apologized for any past wrongdoing? Have they talked about how they’ve learned and grown since the relationship ended? Here are the other key signs your ex means it when they say “I love you:” [5] X Research source They’re willing to take your new relationship slowly. They don’t try to pressure you. They’re focused on working together to find solutions to your past relationship problems. They’ve broken bad habits or picked up healthy new ones since you two were together. They've broken off contact with other people they were seeing."

      "title": "Be upfront if you’re not feeling positive about rekindling the relationship.",
      "content": "Be upfront if you’re not feeling positive about rekindling the relationship. You might not feel like your ex deserves a second chance, and that’s totally fine. Stay kind and respectful as you tell your ex that you don’t reciprocate their feelings. [6] X Research source “It’s nice to hear from you, but I’m in a new relationship now and I’ve moved on.” “I hope you’re doing well. I’m with someone else, though, and I think it’s better if you and I both take some space and time to heal.” “I care about you, and I hope you’ll find someone amazing. But I’ve moved on.” If you'd rather be subtle, reply in a friendly but businesslike way that shows you aren't interested.

      "content": "Rebuilding friendship lets you discover the ways you've both changed. You might decide that all you want is friendship. Or, you might realize you’ve both changed enough to try again. [8] X Research source Either way, replying to their “I love you” text with a request to stay friends is a positive step towards reconnection. “I care about you, but I think it’s better if we stay friends for now.” “It’s really good to hear from you. I do miss you, but I’m only ready for friendship right now.” “I’m still processing the breakup. But I’d love to be friends, if that sounds ok to you.”"

      "title": "Easing back into a relationship creates a stronger foundation.",
      "content": "Easing back into a relationship creates a stronger foundation. Rather than quickly sending a text that reciprocates their feelings, keep your message on the vague side. Simply tell your ex you’re open to the possibility of trying again. If your ex really loves you, their feelings will still be there while you figure things out. [9] X Research source “Thanks for being so open with me. I’m not totally sure about us giving things another shot. But I’d love the chance to figure that out.” “I’m still processing how I feel about us, but I’d love to keep talking.” “I really appreciate you reaching out. I’m going to need some time to work through this, but I’m also not ready to give up on us.”"

      "content": "A request to meet in person shows your ex is willing to put in the effort. Be open to talking with them in person or over video chat. Once they do offer to meet up, talk about what your relationship would look like if you got back together. How can you collaborate to solve issues that came up in your past relationship? [10] X Research source When you do meet up, set boundaries and establish clear expectations. For instance, you might want a committed relationship but your ex might want a casual situation at first. Your ex might want to move back in with you, but you might not want that yet."

      "content": "If your ex physically or emotionally abused you, you shouldn’t respond. Likewise, if your ex cheated on you or otherwise betrayed you, you might want to simply block their number. [11] X Research source You deserve someone who backs up the words “I love you” with respect and kindness.
