      "content": "Apply pressure and brush the stain. Use a bristled brush to brush the suede in one direction. While you want to make sure you're pushing down, don't push too hard. It is important that you apply only as much pressure as needed to remove the stain. In the end, brushing may have the effect of removing stained fibers from your shoes.

Brush your shoes in a back-and-forth motion. Rub until you’ve reduced the stain substantially or it is gone entirely. [4] X Research source"

Then, softly rub the dye spot with your eraser or cleaning stone. This may remove some or all the stain. You may need to rub/buff the stained spot several times to remove all the dye. If the dye comes off on the eraser or cleaning stone, you may need to rub it against something else to remove the dye from it. Then, you can use it on the shoes again."

In this case, use as small of a piece of sandpaper as you need to clean the dye spot. Then, gently rub the spot with your sandpaper. The sandpaper will remove any fibers that are stained. Be gentle. If you are too rough, you could damage the suede."

Do this by using a suede brush and brushing back-and-forth on the shoe in a gentle fashion. Continue to brush the shoe for several minutes.
