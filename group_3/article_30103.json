      "content": "Use scissors to cut 10 plastic spoons in half at an angle. The spoons will serve as the paddles that actually turn the wheel when water passes over them. Cut 10 spoons in half of the handle length and try to get them to be as even as possible. Make your cut at a slight angle so the spoons can be inserted into the styrofoam easier. [1] X Research source Plastic spoons can be hard to cut, so ask for help if you need it. Be careful cutting the plastic spoons as the pieces can fly off when you cut them."

      "content": "Cut a circle with a diameter equal to the length of a spoon. Lay one of the spoons you cut down on the styrofoam and draw a circle around it so the diameter of the circle is about as wide as your spoons. Use a utility knife to cut the circle out of the styrofoam taking care not to let the knife slip and cut yourself. [2] X Research source Check the diameter around the circle to make sure it’s even. The sheet of styrofoam should be at least 2 inches (5.1 cm) thick. Place the styrofoam on a surface that you don’t mind cutting, like cardboard or a cutting block, in case the utility knife cuts through the styrofoam."

      "content": "Insert the spoons into the outside edge of the styrofoam. Push the cut edge of the spoons you cut into the styrofoam until about 1 inch (2.5 cm) of the handle and the bowl of the spoon are exposed. The bowl of the spoon should face the side of the styrofoam, not the front or back. Make sure the spoons are all facing the same direction and are evenly spaced out so they can catch the water that will turn the wheel. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Use a pencil to mark the center of 2 paper plates and your foam circle. It’s important that your skewer goes through the center of your wheel to ensure that it turns properly. Take a ruler and draw a vertical line through the center of the plate, then draw a horizontal line through the center of your plates and the foam circle. Mark the center of the plate and foam disc with a dot. [4] X Research source Use standard 9 in (23 cm) paper plates."

      "content": "Make a hole in the center with a wooden skewer. Once you’ve found your center points, use a skewer to make a hole by pushing it through the center of the plates and the foam. Push the skewer through them one at a time so it penetrates them easier. This will make the perfect size hole. [5] X Research source It may take some effort to push the skewer through the styrofoam and plates. But be careful not to place your hand over the center of the plates and styrofoam to avoid poking yourself with the skewer."

Apply glue to the sides of the foam disk, around the area of the hole in the center, and attach the plates to the disk one at a time, lining up the holes in the center so the skewer will be able to slide through the entire piece. [6] X Research source Allow the glue to dry for at least 1 hour before you move on so the glue is completely set."

The skewer will serve as your dowel rod and will allow the wheel to turn when water passes over the spoons. Make sure the skewer is secure in the wheel because if it’s too loose, the wheel won’t turn. You can place a dab of glue at the hole where the skewer goes through to anchor it into the plate and styrofoam. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Set your wheel on a bucket and fill a glass with water. With your wheel complete, place it on a bucket by resting the skewer on the mouth of the bucket. Place the wheel so it rests securely and won’t fall off or into the bucket when you pour water over it by having about 1 inch (2.5 cm) of the skewer hanging over the mouth of the bucket on each side. Fill a glass of water to use to test your wheel. [8] X Research source"

Take your glass and bring it to the side of the wheel where the bowl of the spoons are facing up and slowly start to pour the water so that the spoons catch it. This will cause the wheel to turn and it should continue to spin as long as you keep pour water over it. [9] X Research source Play around with making the wheel spin faster or slower by pouring more or less water over the spoons to alter the speed."

After you’ve traced the straight line down the board, take a utility knife and use your ruler as a guide to cut the foam board where you measured your line. It may take more than one pass to cut all the way through the board. Run the blade of the knife through the line you cut until it penetrates the other side of the board. [11] X Research source You may want to place cardboard beneath the foam board or cut on a surface that you don’t mind cutting in case the knife cuts through the board."
