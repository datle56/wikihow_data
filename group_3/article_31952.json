      "content": "End the affair immediately, if you haven't already. The only way to begin the process of overcoming your guilt from cheating is to first stop cheating. That means cutting all ties with the person you were having an affair with. [1] X Research source Continuing any sort of relationship with the person you had an affair with can spell trouble for your primary relationship. For example, if the two of you were friends before, it's probably best if you don't try to continue a friendship after."

      "title": "Confess to your partner, if you haven't already.",
      "content": "Confess to your partner, if you haven't already. You're feeling guilty because you know that you've been dishonest to your partner and violated their trust in you—and it probably feels even worse if they have no idea. Simply by being honest with them, you'll feel a weight start to lift from your shoulders. [2] X Research source If you're avoiding telling your partner because you're trying to hold on to the relationship, you're not doing either of you any favors. As long as you don't tell your partner what you've done, you're continuously lying to them about it every time you see them, which only adds to your guilt. Keep in mind there's no guarantee that your partner will want to work things out with you or continue to be with you. The best thing you can do is listen to them and validate their feelings. You might have a good reason not to tell your partner. If your partner is violent or abusive, you're probably better off leaving the relationship."

You might look for someone older or someone who's been through a similar situation before. Explain exactly what happened and ask for their feedback. [3] X Research source For example, you might say, \"I made a huge mistake and ended up cheating. I feel terrible about it now and don't want to ruin my relationship. I know you've been in my shoes before—what should I do?\" Avoid friends who might be overly judgmental about you hurting your partner or who would feel guilty about keeping what you tell them a secret."

      "content": "Join an online or local support group. The people in support groups for cheaters are all people who feel just like you—they cheated, later came to regret it, and are now trying to overcome the guilt and shame. Because they understand exactly what you're going through, they can be great support in helping you overcome your own guilt. [4] X Research source Guilt often intensifies when you put up walls and isolate from others. By opening up to people who can relate to your situation, you can work to overcome guilt. [5] X Research source Ratson notes that \"guilt is an important feeling. It is the appropriate feeling to have when we have deliberately done something hurtful or harmful to another. Guilt allows us to correct our way toward a better more ethical way of living,\" Ratson continues. \"This is why it is very important to process feelings of guilt and recognize if it's constructive.\""

By addressing that need, you'll hopefully not feel the urge to cheat again. Look for a therapist in your area who specializes in relationship issues, specifically cheating. [6] X Research source If this isn't the first time you've cheated, your guilt might be compounded. By uncovering the underlying cause, you can start to lay those other affairs to rest as well."

A spiritual leader or advisor who practices within your belief system can provide spiritual healing for you that you might not be able to get with a therapist. They might also have rituals that will help you feel more closure, such as prayer, meditation, or fasting.

You're not the first to cheat—others have stood in your shoes. Recognizing that common thread and that others have overcome their guilt can help lessen yours too. [7] X Research source For example, if you start to feel down or beat yourself up, you might softly hug yourself while saying, \"I'm only human. I'm not perfect. It's okay. I'm learning and growing.\" Affirming yourself in this way doesn't excuse your wrongdoing—it simply helps alleviate your suffering. You might add, \"I did wrong, but I can try to make amends and do better in the future.\""

Retracing the events that led up to the cheating might help you figure out what caused it. If you're worried about someone reading what you've written, you might shred the pages or set them on fire.

Different spiritual traditions have rituals related to spiritual healing, forgiveness, and acceptance that can help you overcome guilt. You can also make up your own ritual! As long as you take it seriously and it has meaning for you, it can have a pretty big impact on your ability to overcome your guilt. For example, you might take something that symbolizes the affair and bury it to symbolize putting the past behind you and moving on with your life. [9] X Research source This ritual might be more meaningful if you get your partner involved—especially if they've recommitted to a relationship with you. Their forgiveness will go a long way towards helping you overcome your guilt."

If you start a meditation practice , you'll gain tools that enable you to break the hold the past has on you and move forward. When you're no longer dwelling in the past, you'll feel a lot less guilty.

When you start thinking about the past, ask yourself \"What now?\" Shift your focus gently back into the present and think about what you can do in this very minute that will make you feel better about the situation. Boswell advises that if you want to overcome guilt and \"begin healing, fast-forward to here-and-now and connect the dots. Remember and remind yourself that you are no longer required to play that part.\" This can also help you uncover some of the deep-seated reasons for your cheating, which can also ease your guilt."

That can help you see how the feeling fades. Boswell emphasizes that \"forgiving yourself is another important practice. If you would let a friend off the hook for the same thing you're feeling guilty about, then why not let yourself off the hook?\" Avoid negative coping strategies, such as drugs and alcohol, which can lead to depression, addiction, and other issues. If you find yourself withdrawing from others or seeking escape through vices, talk to a mental health professional."

[17] X Research source It's also possible that your partner will want some time to process what you've told them and think about things. If that's the case, agree to meet up and talk in a day or two.

The actual act of cheating might have been a split-second decision, but the damage you've done to your primary relationship is going to take a bit longer to prepare. In the heat of the moment, you're both far too emotional to make a rational decision about what you want to do with your relationship. Give it at least a couple of weeks before you make up your mind. [20] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Ideally, the two of you will make this decision together after you've had time to process. But it's also a possibility that your partner will unilaterally decide to end the relationship—and there's nothing you can really do about that except be prepared for it.
