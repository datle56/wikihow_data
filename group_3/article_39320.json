A thick or untidy goatee might not go down too well with your workplace, or if you want to maintain a professional look. Select a style that is not too dominant and that you can regularly maintain, to make sure that you goatee and professional life go together. Having a well-groomed goatee can give you a creative, innovative, and professional demeanor. Try out a Van Dyke style goatee, which is a chin beard, mustache, and soul patch, with a cropped hair length and clean shaven face. The Van Dyke style works especially well for men with oblong face shapes."

      "content": "Grow out your facial hair. Before you can get into shaving a goatee, you need to grow out your beard first. Although it can be annoying to have to endure the patchiness and itchiness of a new beard, let the facial hair surrounding your chin, mouth, and nose grow out. This creates a solid foundation for shaving, and also for deciding on what shape you like. One to two weeks worth of growth is an ideal place to start. [3] X Research source Using beard oil during the growing stage can help make the process easier. Not only does beard oil speed up the progress of facial hair growth, but it can also reduce beard itch. [4] X Research source"

Just double check that the marker is washable first! [5] X Research source It's really important to have a clear image of what you want your goatee to look like."

      "title": "Outline your goatee.",
      "content": "Outline your goatee. Comb through your beard to straighten out any unruly hair, and then begin with a new, sharp, and clean razor, or a trimmer without the guard, to define the edges of your goatee. Start on your neck with little cuts, about the size of the razor blade or trimmer. Slowly work around to your chin and then cheeks, until you are happy with the edges of your goatee. Goatees typically aren’t any wider than your mouth. It can help to smile when shaving, and to make sure the edges of your goatee aren’t any wider than the corners of your smile or dimples. Two to three fingers width above your Adam’s apple is a good place for the outline on your throat. You can always shorten it later if it feels like it goes too far down your neck. Take your time and be careful, as there is no rush to get your goatee looking right. Remember that if you make a mistake, most people won’t notice something slight. If it’s extremely noticeable, you can always just shave your beard off evenly and start again in a week or two."

      "content": "Trim your goatee. Use an electric beard trimmer and make small, downward strokes moving from the outside in on your goatee. Trim all your facial hair to an even length. If you’re going for a mustache in combination with your goatee, it should be the same length or shorter than the rest of your goatee. [6] X Research source Although using scissors may seem easier to handle than a trimmer when you first start out, they are not recommended as it is too easy to cut the hair unevenly."

      "content": "Shave the parts of your face which will remain clean shaven. This includes your cheeks, and any parts of your chin or neck that are outside the edges of your goatee. When shaving close to the outline of your goatee, always start on the edge and shave outward to avoid accidentally shaving off part of it. For the part of your goatee on your neck, this means shaving vertically downwards, and for your chin, shaving towards your ears. If using a razor, use clear shaving gel rather than shaving foam or cream so that you can see the outline of your goatee while shaving."

Shave the rest of your face regularly to remove any stubble, as this will help your goatee to look neat, tidy, and stand out. Always wait until your beard is completely dry before trimming or styling. Working with wet hair can make it easy to accidentally trim off too much. A small, sharp razor works best for trimming your goatee."
