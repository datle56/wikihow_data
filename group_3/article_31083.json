      "content": "Dry-aging Choose dry-aged beef for an especially flavorful steak. Dry-aging is the process by which cuts of beef are aged for many weeks to many months. Dry-aging takes place before the beef is trimmed and cut into steaks. The reason for the dry-aging process is mainly to give the steak more flavor and help it be more tender than it would be when fresh. [21] X Research source Dry-aged beef develops more beefy, nutty, and cheese-like aromas. It can lose up to 30% of its volume in water loss, which also adds to the flavor. The enzymes in the meat muscles break down during the dry-aging process, which adds to the tenderness of the meat."

The location of the cut of beef directly determines how tender or lean it is, as well as the amount of marbling from fat it has. Cuts of beef taken from the loin and rib sections are typically more tender, while cuts like chuck and round are tougher because of the harder-working muscles found there; chuck steak comes from the shoulder area, while round steaks come from the hind legs. [22] X Research source The cut location also has an effect on the grain of the meat and how easily it can be chewed. The more tender the cut, the easier you can chew it."

The tenderness of the meat, its marbling, and flavor profile also add to the “luxury” quality of the steak (and the corresponding price)."
