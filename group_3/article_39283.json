If you have a thicker eyeliner pencil, you may need to leave it in for a longer period of time (ten or fifteen minutes, or however long it takes to harden)."

Hold the pencil in your non-dominant hand, and the knife in your dominant hand. Point the pencil downward. Hold the knife perpendicular to the pencil, with the tip an inch or so from the point of the pencil. With the thumb of your non-dominant hand, push the knife to the end of the pencil (to the tip). The shavings should come off in thin strips. Repeat this process all the way around the circumference of the pencil. Repeat until sharp.
