[3] X Research source Strange Whirlpools are open for 15 minutes once they are announced. They are most commonly found near Moosewood, in front of Forsaken Shores, by Roslit Bay, near Earmark Island, and around the Statue of Sovereignty. However, they can spawn anywhere on the map. You'll need to fish as well as use Crab Cages to complete the Vertigo bestiary. Some fish can only be caught in Vertigo during certain seasons. It's best to start fishing in Vertigo in Winter, then wait until the server rolls over to Spring to finish, since all the fish can be caught in Winter and/or Spring. Isonade can only be caught by fishing in the Strange Whirlpool. Check out the Vertigo bestiary below ."
