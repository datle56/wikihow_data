      "content": "Chemistry is hard to define, but you know it when you feel it. It usually means that you have an intense spark of attraction to someone, yet you also feel at ease and comfortable in their presence. You may also feel like you’re naturally in sync with each other, even though you just met. [1] X Research source If this describes the vibe between the two of you, chances are your date was a major success!"

In fact, an individual’s rate of smiling tends to increase dramatically when they’re in the presence of someone they’re physically attracted to.

If you found yourselves flowing from topic to topic easily with very few awkward silences to fill, this is a major indicator that you had a great first date! [5] X Research source Tip: If you want to become a great conversationalist on dates, Los Angeles-based dating coach Lisa Shield has some valuable advice: “Really great conversation happens when you take one topic and you go deeper with it,” Shield says. This is a more effective tactic than asking a bunch of unrelated, rapid-fire questions, which makes the date feel too much like an interview. For example, “You might say, ‘Where did you grow up?’ And they may say, ‘I grew up in Detroit.’ And you might say, ‘Wow, tell me about Detroit. What was it like growing up there?’” Shield explains."

      "content": "Body language cues can reveal that someone is attracted to you. “If someone is interested in you, they’re going to lean in, they’re going to be engaged,” says Cher Gopman, dating coach and founder of NYC Wingwoman LLC. This is called open body language, and it indicates that someone wants to become closer to you. If your date turned their body to face you, leaned in closer to you while you talked, and had their arms in an open position (rather than crossed), these are all signs that they were super into you!

Even little things like picking a piece of lint out of your hair for you or straightening your crooked collar are positive signs. These types of touches are called “preening,” and they indicate that someone's physically attracted to you. [7] X Research source"

      "title": "Try to recall whether or not your date mirrored your body language.",
      "content": "Try to recall whether or not your date mirrored your body language. When two people are attracted to each other, they tend to subconsciously copy each other’s movements. If you tucked your hair behind your ear, for example, your date may have subconsciously reached for their own hair. Or, if you leaned toward them, they may have naturally leaned toward you, too. If you noticed your date mirroring your movements in this way, there’s a good chance they were into you! [8] X Research source Tip: If you want to use body language to flirt during a date, try to subtly mirror a few of your date’s gestures. [9] X Research source For example, if they lean in closer, lean in too. If they take a sip of their drink, reach for yours as well. Just be sure not to overdo it—you don’t want to copy every single thing they do. Just a few mirrored actions are enough to subtly convey your interest."

[10] X Research source If the two of you made eye contact throughout your date, this is a major indication that you felt comfortable, connected, and attracted to each other. This may be harder to see—especially if you’re in a dimly lit restaurant or bar—but pupil dilation is another indicator of physical attraction. This is because gazing into someone’s eyes releases oxytocin, which causes your pupils to dilate. And, the wider the dilation, the more attracted the person feels!"

Tip: If they haven’t reached out to you yet after your date, don’t be afraid to take the initiative and send a follow-up text yourself! Here are some examples of what to say: “Hey, just wanted to say I had a great time tonight! Did you make it home okay?” “Thank you for such a fun time last night. We should do it again sometime!” “Just wanted to let you know that I really enjoyed our date, and I’d love to see you again.” [21] X Research source"

[22] X Research source Tip: If you’re feeling bold, consider asking for a second date yourself. There’s no rule that says you have to wait for them to make the first move! Text them something casual, like, “I had a great time the other night, and I’d love to see you again this weekend if you’re free.” Or, make a more specific plan and say something like, “Hey! I heard that new wine bar is having its grand opening this Friday. Do you want to come with me?” [23] X Research source"
