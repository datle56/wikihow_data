      "title": "Soak a cotton ball with acetone and press it to your nail.",
      "content": "Soak a cotton ball with acetone and press it to your nail. Acetone breaks down nail polish and adhesives, so your press-ons will no longer be usable after taking them off with this method. [1] X Research source If you have very long press-on nails, cut them down with nail tip clippers to make them easier to wrap with foil. Be careful not to purchase a non-acetone nail polish remover, which won’t be helpful in dissolving adhesive. Acetone can dry out your cuticle and the skin around your fingernail. Use cuticle oil to protect your skin. As a bonus, the oil may also help break down the adhesive under the press-on nail."

While holding the acetone-soaked cotton against your fingernail, wrap a 3 inches (7.6 cm) x 3 inches (7.6 cm) square of aluminum foil around the tip of your finger to keep the cotton in place. The foil holds in heat and slows evaporation, making the acetone work faster. Plastic wrap or nail clips are also effective for holding the cotton ball to your nail.

Or, you can use a cuticle pusher to work the press-on off your natural nail slowly. Take your time, even if the nail seems loose. Pulling a press-on off too quickly can cause damage to your nails.
