This life change is two-fold: it will involve breaking some time-wasting habits, and learning to say \"no.\" Common time-wasting habits include social media, checking email too often, watching television, and gossiping. When you engage in these types of activities, consider setting a timer for yourself. When the time is up, you must get back to work. If your boss, friends, spouse, and family are all asking things of you, it can be hard to keep up! Whenever you are asked to complete a project or do a favor, stop to consider whether or not you truly have the time to do the task well. Sometimes, you will need to say, \"I just don't have time for that today.\" Reader Poll: We asked 240 wikiHow readers what they think is the most important factor in maintaining a healthy work-life balance, and 48% of them said setting clear boundaries between work and personal life.

Keep healthy snacks (such as raw almonds) in your bag or desk at work in case you have to skip lunch. Keep a notebook (or tablet computer) with you so that you can get a little work done while you wait somewhere. Find out if there is the possibility of working from home, or video conferencing into a meeting, if you cannot be there in person."
