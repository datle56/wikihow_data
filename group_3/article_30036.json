[5] X Research source The features don't have to be perfect. After all, pirates aren't known as being great artists! Include things like: A red X to mark the spot. This is probably the most important feature! Landmarks to determine a starting point and a finishing point (the treasure spot), and landmarks to help the hunters find their way in the middle. Trees, shrubs, or plants. Trees can be made by a simple vertical line with horizontal lines squiggled on top of it that starts wider at the base and get increasingly smaller toward the top. Make sure to leave a small portion of your vertical line uncovered at the bottom to create the trunk of the tree. You can also make more detailed trees if you want to spend the time. Houses or other buildings. Mountains or hills. Rivers or other bodies of water. You can locate the treasure hunt on an island surrounded by water. For a more imaginative look, include some fantasy elements like a sea serpent, some ships, or a castle."
