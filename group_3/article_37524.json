You can find the proper information to email or call fan support through the Contact Us page at [1] ."

Next, they will print out a new set. In many cases, the tickets will be left at the venue’s Will Call window. However, if you lose the tickets more than several weeks before the event, they may mail them to you. Ticketmaster may charge you a reprint fee for having to print the tickets a second time. Ask the customer service representative that you speak with about it."
