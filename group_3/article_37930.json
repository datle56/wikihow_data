      "title": "Choose a sports bra that's 1 size smaller than normal and comfortable.",
      "content": "Choose a sports bra that's 1 size smaller than normal and comfortable. You want your bra to be tight but not so tight that it hurts. Typically, a bra that’s 1 size smaller than your usual bra size is your best option. If you can, try on different bras and pick the 1 that works best for you. [1] X Research source You can buy a sports bra at an athletic store or a department store."

      "title": "Check that the bra you choose is labeled as “no bounce.”",
      "content": "Check that the bra you choose is labeled as “no bounce.” Sports bras provide different levels of support, and you want the most support available. Usually, “no bounce” bras provide the most flattening. Look at the label on the bra to make sure it says it prevents bounce. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Add a second sports bra if you have a larger chest.",
      "content": "Add a second sports bra if you have a larger chest. Wearing 2 sports bras at 1 time can help you get the look you want. This is not considered double binding, so it’s usually safe. However, make sure you can move comfortably while wearing the bras. [3] X Research source If you experience any discomfort, take off 1 or both bras. You might find that wearing the second bra backward flattens your chest more. Try this out to see if it works for you."

      "title": "Use a pair of control-top pantyhose as a temporary option.",
      "content": "Use a pair of control-top pantyhose as a temporary option. Control-top pantyhose have a very tight upper portion that may work as a binder. Usually, this is a safe option if it’s used occasionally. [4] X Research source It’s best to use a new pair because it will be tighter. However, you can use an old pair of pantyhose if that’s what you have."
    },
    {
      "title": "Use scissors to cut the legs off of the pantyhose.",
      "content": "Use scissors to cut the legs off of the pantyhose. You’re going to be wearing the pantyhose upside down over your head, so you need to remove the legs. Cut them at the base of the torso area or at around the mid-thigh level, depending on how you want to wear your pantyhose binder. [5] X Research source Discard the legs of the pantyhose because you won’t need them."
    },
    {
      "title": "Cut a hole in the crotch of the pantyhose for your neck.",
      "content": "Cut a hole in the crotch of the pantyhose for your neck. Your head is going to go through the crotch of the pantyhose, so you need a hole for it. Use your scissors to cut out the crotch of the hose. This should turn your pantyhose into a tank top or a small short-sleeved shirt. [6] X Research source Make sure you cut away all of the cotton portion of the crotch. Otherwise, it’ll be hard to stretch it out for your head to fit through."

    {
      "title": "Pull the pantyhose over your head with the waistband at the bottom.",
      "content": "Pull the pantyhose over your head with the waistband at the bottom. Put your head through the hole in your crotch. Then, put your arms through the holes where the legs were. Finally, pull the control-top portion down over your chest. Adjust your breasts so they’re as flat as possible. [7] X Research source You might sweat more while wearing a pantyhose binder because the material typically holds in sweat."

    {
      "title": "Choose a camisole that has a built-in bra.",
      "content": "Choose a camisole that has a built-in bra. This type of camisole will have an extra panel on the top half of the shirt with a thick band to hold it in place. This inside panel provides extra support for your chest, which can help flatten it out. [8] X Research source You can buy a camisole where women’s clothing is sold. Using a camisole works best if your breasts are small."

    {
      "title": "Turn the camisole top around so the bra band is over your chest.",
      "content": "Turn the camisole top around so the bra band is over your chest. The back panel is tighter than the front side, which is looser to accommodate your breasts. Put the top on backward so the tight side will provide more support, then pull the inside panel down over your breasts. [9] X Research source If necessary, use the plastic adjusters on the straps to raise the camisole higher on your chest."

      "title": "Fold the bottom portion of your camisole up over your chest.",
      "content": "Fold the bottom portion of your camisole up over your chest. Smooth down the fabric and fold a third of the camisole up. Then, fold the camisole again. If necessary, fold it 1 more time so that it’s layered over your chest. [10] X Research source The layers will help smooth out your chest."

      "title": "Use layering to disguise your chest.",
      "content": "Use layering to disguise your chest. Wearing more than 1 shirt at a time can be a very effective strategy for hiding your chest. Try layering t-shirts or wearing a t-shirt under a button-up shirt. [11] X Research source If your chest is large, you might wear 2 undershirts with your button-up shirts to hide your chest. Thicker shirts and sweaters are a good way to hide your chest in the winter. During the summer, layer with thinner shirts (like undershirts and T-shirts) to avoid overheating."

      "content": "Wear a button-up shirt with a chest pocket to minimize your chest. While you might think that chest pockets would draw eyes to your chest, they’re actually pretty effective at disguising the curve of breasts. The pocket can trick people into thinking what they’re seeing is caused by the pocket. Look for button-up shirts that have 1 or 2 pockets over the chest. [12] X Research source You can also wear a tight undershirt to provide more coverage."

      "title": "Wear a sports compression shirt under your regular clothing.",
      "content": "Wear a sports compression shirt under your regular clothing. Compression clothing is made from a stretchy material that fits tightly over your body. This makes compression shirts great for smoothing out your chest. Wear your shirt alone or under your other clothing to flatten out your breasts. [13] X Research source You can find compression shirts where athletic wear is sold. You might prefer to buy a shirt from the men’s department."

      "content": "Wear your binder for up to 8 hours at a time. It’s understandable that you’d want to bind all the time, but that’s not safe for your body. You need to take a break from your binder so your tissues, muscles, and bones don’t get damaged. Don’t wear your binder for longer than 6-8 hours at a time. [14] X Research source When you’re not wearing a binder, layered clothing, and camisoles can help hide the look of your breasts. Listen to your body. If you're experiencing discomfort, pain, or difficulty breathing, take a break from binding, even if it hasn't been 8 hours yet."

      "content": "Don’t ever use bandages or duct tape to bind your chest. These items may seem like a great binder, but they can hurt your body. That’s because they don’t provide any give when you move around. This can cause muscle, rib, spine, and lung damage. To avoid these problems, stick with your safe binders. [17] X Research source You've probably seen these products used as binders in movies. However, that doesn't make them safe."

However, never combine 2 different methods because it can hurt your body. Keep trying different methods until you find what works for you. It might take some time for you to be happy with the results, so don’t give up."

Most binders are too restrictive for exercise, but it’s okay to wear a sports bra. [18] X Research source It’s best to just wear 1 sports bra while you’re exercising.

Unfortunately, a binder that is too tight or worn too long can cause back or chest pain, as well as breathing difficulties. You might be worried about talking to your doctor, and that’s understandable. However, it’s important that you get checked out to make sure you’re okay. Go to your primary doctor or visit an urgent care center to find out if you need treatment. [19] X Research source If you’re a minor, you’ll typically need your parent or guardian’s permission for treatment. This might be scary if you haven’t told your parents that you feel more comfortable with your chest bound. However, your health is most important. Just tell your parent or guardian that you’re having trouble breathing and need to see a doctor. You may be able to talk to the doctor alone or you could try passing them a note."
