      "content": "Address stains on the outside of the pot. Coffee stains on the inside of the coffee pot are most common, but it’s also possible to get stains on the outside of the pot. To clean these, place a tablespoon (14 g) of baking soda into a small bowl. Add boiling water a few drops at a time until you have a smooth paste. Use the tip of a butter knife to apply the paste to any stains on the outside of the pot. [3] X Research source"

Let the cleaning solution inside and the baking soda paste soak for 30 minutes. [4] X Research source Letting the cleaning solution and paste soak will give them time to attack the stain, which will make it easier to scrub away."

When the pot has been rinsed, inspect the inside and outside to ensure that all the stains are gone. [6] X Research source If there are any stains left, try a different cleaning solution.

      "content": "Don’t leave coffee in the pot for extended periods. Coffee contains oils, and it’s these oils that can stain your pot, especially if you leave coffee sitting in the pot for extended periods. [9] X Research source To prevent stains from forming, don’t leave coffee sitting in the pot for more than 30 minutes. This is especially important if there's only a small amount of coffee left in the pot, because the burner can make the coffee evaporate faster, and this will leave baked-on stains in the bottom of the pot. To avoid having leftover coffee in the pot, make only enough coffee to serve each person one to two cups at a time."

Trace amounts of coffee left in the bottom of the pot can dry and bake on, and this will leave those annoying and hard-to-clean stains in the bottom of the pot. As soon as the coffee pot is empty, rinse it out with hot water to remove leftover coffee traces. Rinse the inside and outside of the pot so that spilled drips don’t stain the exterior of the pot."

      "content": "Wipe up drips immediately. When you pour a coffee, there are often a few dribbles that spill down the side of the spout and onto the outside and bottom of the coffee pot. Over time, these can cause stains if they aren't addressed immediately. To prevent stains on the outside and exterior bottom of the pot, use a damp cloth to wipe drips from the outside of the pot after you pour each cup."

Each morning, after you've made your final cup of coffee for the day, clean the inside and outside of the pot with hot soapy water and a cloth or brush. When the pot is clean, rinse it with clean water and towel dry it to prevent water and mineral stains. [10] X Research source If you don’t have time to clean the pot in the morning, just rinse it out and clean it when you get home from work or school in the afternoon or evening."
