      "content": "Listen to the other person and directly respond to their words. The trick to thinking of a quick witted comeback is to focus on what the other person is saying. Rather than memorizing a few one-liners, play off of their words to come up with a line that’s even more shocking and savage. [3] X Research source For example, if the other person is being selfish, you might say, “I forgot the whole world revolves around you. My bad!” rather than mentioning their appearance or intelligence."

      "content": "Utilize your facial expressions to deliver the ultimate burn. Raise an eyebrow, roll your eyes , or smirk to communicate that the other person’s words were utterly ridiculous. When you deliver your comeback, remember to push your shoulders back and keep your voice steady to appear confident . Feel free to use your hands to “shoo” them away or “zip” your lips together. If you’re talking to a friend or younger sibling, deliver your lines in a friendly and lighthearted way. A smile, giggle, or wink can reassure someone that you’re just teasing them."
