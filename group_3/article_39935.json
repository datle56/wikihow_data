Scientists have pinpointed more than 50 different types of smiles, and research suggests that the sincerest smile of all is the Duchenne smile – a smile that pushes up into the eyes. [1] X Research source The reason it's more genuine is because the muscles needed to truly smile with our eyes are involuntary; they only become engaged in an authentic smile, not in a courtesy smile. Every time you smile because something makes you happy or you find it funny, every time your smile expresses how you really feel, your eyes will smile along with your lips. They'll crinkle at the corners so that your whole face looks fully engaged in the smile. Look at pictures of yourself that were taken when you were laughing, or work yourself into a belly laugh by watching something funny and then take a selfie . Make sure you're really feeling happy when the picture is snapped. Now compare the picture of you smiling with happiness to a picture of yourself giving the type of fake, jack o' lantern-esque smile you've probably flashed for a dozen school pictures. See the difference in the eyes?"

A genuine smile that engages your eyes and mouth usually feels easy, natural and good. Contrast this to the way it feels to force a smile when someone says \"cheese\": after a couple seconds of holding the expression, your face muscles start to get fatigued. Once you identify the feeling of smiling with your eyes, try to memorize it. Practice engaging your whole face when you smile. The more you do it, the easier it will become. On the other hand, remember how it feels when you aren't smiling with your eyes. When that tell-tale forced feeling takes over your face, you'll be able to correct your smile to make it look more genuine."

      "content": "Practice imitating a Duchenne smile. Even though it's a little tricky, you can imitate this type of smile by squinting slightly to create small pillows beneath your eyes. Look in the mirror and give it a try. If you produce crow’s feet in the corners of your eyes while attempting this, you are doing it properly. Once you master the smiling-eye technique, you will be able to use it to brighten up even very sly or faint smiles. Each time you smile, no matter what the reason is, try to remember to squint a little. Don't overdo it, or your face will look distorted; just a bit of a squint will add the appropriate twinkle to your eye. Try making eye contact as you squint to have a big impact on the person you're smiling at."

In other words, try to how to Be Optimistic and real smiles will appear on your face throughout the day. Think about who has the most genuine smiles: kids! They don't worry as much as adults because life is less complicated for them. Try to follow their lead and be laid back and playful ! Try not to force yourself to smile unless you're really feeling happy. Stop being a people-pleaser. If you constantly smile in order to be polite and agreeable, you're tightly controlling your countenance and not giving your Duchenne smile much of a chance to shine through. A real smile arises from your own personal joy, not someone else's."

If you're preoccupied with the color or straightness of your teeth, the prominence of your gums, the smell of your breath, and so on, you might subconsciously stifle your smile because you feel embarrassed. Taking care of the issues that distract you from fully smiling will help you have a brighter and more genuine smile. Look into whitening your teeth and getting rid of bad breath to take care of two easy-to-fix sources of self-consciousness. If you really want to rock the Duchenne, play up your eyes as well. Maintain your eyebrows and use a little eye makeup to make your eyes stand out."

When you're feeling nervous about how you come off to other people, it will come through in your smile. Instead of worrying about what impression you're making, let yourself feel free to be expressive. Check out the other person's smile when you're talking. Is the person smiling with his or her eyes? If you see a Duchenne smile on the other person's face, you know it's genuine, which might set you more at ease and help you relax into the conversation a bit. On the other hand, if the person's smile looks fake, it might be hard to flash a genuine grin. If you want to seem sincere, you might have to channel some happy thoughts for a bit, or at least remember to squint!"

In the meantime, smile slightly with your mouth, but don't break into a full grin. It's more subtle than overtly smiling with your eyes, and it gives the impression that you're friendly and interesting.

Teeging is opening your mouth slightly so that your teeth are showing and pressing your tongue up against them. At the same time, smize or squinch with your eyes. Done right, teeging makes you look playful and cute. If you try this pose for a selfie, take the picture from the side, rather than head-on."
