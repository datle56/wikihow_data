      "content": "Mix water and vinegar at a 1:1 ratio in a spray bottle. Grab an empty 16 fl oz (470 mL) glass spray bottle and fill it with 1 c (240 mL) of distilled white vinegar and water each. As a general rule of thumb, stick to a sturdy material like glass rather than plastic when it comes to storing your cleaning mixture. [1] X Research source Optional: Add 3 drops of tea tree oil and 3 drops of grapefruit essential oil to the vinegar mixture and shake it up really well. [2] X Research source For a lemon-fresh scent: Rather than using essential oils, make your cleaning solution with lemon rinds. Green cleaning expert Susan Stocker advises “filling a quart-sized glass jar with lemon rinds and covering them with white vinegar. Let the mixture sit for 2 weeks, and then strain the mixture into a glass spray bottle.” According to cleaning expert James Sears, you can use apple cider vinegar as the vinegar in the cleaning solution. He notes that you can also fill a spray bottle with 2 ⁄ 3 c (160 mL) of water and 1 ⁄ 3 c (79 mL) of distilled white vinegar when prepping your cleaning vinegar. Tea tree oil is known for its antifungal and disinfectant properties. Other essential oils have notable health benefits: peppermint oil has disinfecting qualities, while lemongrass oil , lemon oil , and orange oil have anti-bacterial benefits.
