      "content": "Treat your carpets and furniture with anti-static sprays. According to image consultant Jordan Stolch, an anti-static spray is “going to be your guard” against static cling. Many commercial anti-static sprays are available to reduce static around your home. Simply follow the spray’s instructions to apply it to your furniture and/or carpet. If you spray your carpet, wait for it to dry completely before walking on it. This will greatly decrease the amount of static electricity you experience. [5] X Research source Most carpet retailers and online companies offer spray treatments for rugs and carpets. Some carpets are also specifically made with an anti-static component. To make a static-reducing spray at home, mix 1 capful of fabric softener with antistatic properties in a spray bottle of water. Shake the mixture and lightly spray it over the carpet."

      "title": "Touch something metal.",
      "content": "Touch something metal. Metal can help ground static electricity, preventing static shocks. Before touching a doorknob or another person, tap a metal object like a key or a coin against a wooden surface, like a table. This safely discharges built-up static on your body. Alternatively, touch your metal object to the metal surface you’re about to touch so you don’t get shocked. [12] X Research source It’s a good idea to keep a metal object on your person at all times, especially during winter when static electricity is more prominent. This can be a coin, a keychain, or even a thimble. This is also known as grounding yourself —you never accumulate electrical charges, and the charges are instead transferred to the metal object. Another option is to wear an anti-static wrist strap , especially if you frequently work with electronic components. These help prevent the buildup of static electricity in the body, but some types have been proven ineffective."

      "content": "Use dryer sheets and fabric softener when doing laundry. A great way to reduce static in your laundry is to use dryer sheets (or dryer balls ) and fabric softener. As clothes tumble and rub together, these coat the fabrics with lubricants to help neutralize static. When choosing a fabric softener, laundry specialist Kamel Almani recommends using “a liquid fabric softener with antistatic properties.” Dryer sheets and fabric softener are ideal for natural fabrics like cotton, but should be avoided when washing athletic wear, microfiber, towels, and flame-resistant or water-repellant fabrics. If you have fragrance or dye allergies, dryer sheets may also cause skin reactions. Dryer balls help keep laundry from clumping together, minimize static, reduce wrinkles, and soften clothes. Laundry specialist Ayad Mirjan recommends “3 dryer balls per load” to help get rid of static cling."

      "content": "Add baking soda and vinegar to the wash. Before starting the washing cycle, add ¼ cup (59 ml) of baking soda to your clothes. This creates a barrier between the positive and negative charges to prevent static buildup. When your washing machine transitions to the rinse cycle, pause it and pour in ¼ cup (59 ml) of white distilled vinegar. This serves as both a fabric softener and a static reducer. [20] X Research source Depending on the size of the laundry load, you may need to adjust the amount of baking soda you add. For bigger loads, add about ½ cup of baking soda, and for small loads, use 1 or 2 tablespoons. Baking soda is also considered a water softener and a fabric softener."

One of the best ways to reduce static electricity in your laundry is to air-dry your clothes, as the tumbling and friction in a dryer often contributes to the buildup of static electricity. If possible, hang your clothes somewhere they can dry naturally. [22] X Research source Another option is to use a steam dryer or select the steam cycle on your dryer, which uses hot, moist air to dry clothes. This helps neutralize static and reduce wrinkles. If you aren’t using a dryer, Mirjan says, “Hang clothes to dry—if possible, outdoors. Be sure that the clothing goes through a complete spin cycle so the excess water can spin out.”"

For the last 5-10 minutes of the drying cycle, turn the dryer to the lowest heat setting and add a damp washcloth to the machine. Then, allow the dryer to finish its cycle. This will add moisture to the air to prevent electrical charges from building up in the dryer. [23] X Research source Some dryers also have a “reduce static” option. Using this feature means the dryer will add a small amount of moisture on its own at the end of its cycle. If your dryer has this feature, you won’t need to add a damp washcloth. Shake your clothes as soon as they’re finished drying. This helps prevent static electricity from setting in. [24] X Research source"

      "content": "Static electricity occurs when an electrical charge builds up on an object. This often happens when two different materials, like your clothes and your couch, rub against each other. This friction causes electrons to move from one material to the other, creating an imbalance where one object has extra electrons (negatively charged) and the other loses them (positively charged). [32] X Trustworthy Source Library of Congress Official library of the U.S. and main research institution for Congress and the American public Go to source When you touch something, the electrons quickly move to balance the charges out, resulting in a small shock.
