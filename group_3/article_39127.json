Take the round object, such as a glass, a jar lid or a can of soup, to use as your base template. Bear in mind that the finished ball will be approximately the same diameter as the round object you use to trace the pattern with. Trace the round object once and then move it 2/3rds of its width away from the original tracing and trace it again. Join the two circles from edge to edge. Narrow the \"neck\" part of the diagram by approximately a quarter of the total width of the circles on both top and bottom. From here on forth, ignore the \"outer\" lines, as they were for reference only. Using the inner lines as your guide to make the final template, round the inner corners. Draw a second line (dotted in this case) around the outside of your shape to serve as your cutting line (allowing 1/4 inch seam allowance). seam"
