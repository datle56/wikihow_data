      "content": "Halal dating is a form of dating that aligns with Islamic principles. Like traditional Islamic courtship, it’s focused on finding a spouse, but emphasizes respect and modesty equally. Halal dating still stands by certain guidelines made in Islam, along with possibly consulting religious figures or family members along the way. [24] X Research source “ Niyyah ” (or intentions) are central to dating in Islam; those who attempt to form relationships must keep marriage as their ultimate goal. The idea of “halal” in Islamic teachings refers to something “lawful,” mostly in connection with food and drink, but it’s come to mean other permissible things that Muslims can do. Something “ haram ,” on the other hand, means something “not permitted.”"

      "content": "This style of dating balances tradition with a need for emotional intimacy. More traditional Muslim dating practices focus on finding a partner for marriage under the supervision of your parents. Halal dating takes the responsibility of courting that once fell solely on parents and gives it back to the two people involved. [25] X Research source Halal dating has risen in popularity due to a need among young Muslims to get to know each other better prior to marriage. Physical intimacy is still strictly prohibited before getting married, but halal dating attempts to add more emotional intimacy to the relationship."

      "title": "Halal dating reflects a more modern idea of being Muslim.",
      "content": "Halal dating reflects a more modern idea of being Muslim. Because of globalization, pop culture, and “third culture” kids—those raised in a culture different from that of their parents or their background and nationality—modern teenagers and young people who practice Islam have a different moral compass than they once did. Their exposure to the rest of the world means they’ve become more interested in their own ways of dating while remaining proper Muslims. [26] X Research source Muslim-focused dating apps like Muzz, InshAllah, Muslima, and Proposal have popped up, which give practicing Muslims the opportunity to date others who share their faith."

      "content": "Keep your delivery lighthearted. Pick-up lines are best when they’re sweet, funny, and entertaining.

      "content": "Avoid saying anything offensive. If you’re not sure about how the other person will receive the pick up line, avoid saying it. Make sure you know them well enough to use it, and trust your instinct when it comes to which type of pick-up line to use. For instance, if they’re extremely conservative in their religious practice, saying a line that jokes about Quranic verse may make them uncomfortable. Instead, try something like, “Are you made of dates? Because you’re a sweet blessing.”"

Follow up your pick up line with genuine, respectful words that show them you’re serious about getting closer. Making a lighthearted joke about yourself can help them feel like you’re not just having fun at their expense."

They have just as much right to respond (or not) to your pick up line as you have to say it to them. Be respectful, honor them if they look uncomfortable, and instead try your line on someone more receptive."
