      "content": "Open the print dialog. How you do this depends on your operating system and program, but you can usually access it by clicking the File option at the top of the screen and choosing Print . In many programs, the shortcut Ctrl + P (Windows) or ⌘ Cmd + P (Mac) will also open the print dialog. Before continuing, make sure your document or project is ready to be printed and that you've changed the document size to match the size of cardstock that you have. How you do this varies depending on the program and/or operating system you're using, but the option is usually found in the File or Edit menu under Page Setup (or something similar). If the program opens its own print window and you don't see the options listed in this guide, look for an option to open the system print dialog. You may have to look under Other options (or something similar) to find this."

      "content": "Set your document's paper type. Look for an option that says Paper Type or Media Type . In the dropdown, look for a paper option that says \"cardstock,\" \"thick,\" or \"heavy.\" If you don't see any of these options, you could also try selecting an option for photo paper, as it's thicker than regular printer paper. Each printer has different paper type options. Even if the printer doesn't have a cardstock, choosing any type of thicker paper will more than likely work. However, you may have to try a few different options until the printer prints your document correctly. If your printer doesn't have options other than plain paper, you still might be able to print on thinner cardstock—but be aware that your printer might jam ."

The option may be a dropdown or a button you can click. By default, your printer will print in the portrait orientation. If your document is set to landscape orientation, you must change your printer's orientation to landscape, or it won't print properly."

You can either choose a predefined paper size from the dropdown, or you can enter your paper size by selecting Custom or similar (Windows) or Manage Custom Sizes on Mac. If you are printing on letter size or A4 paper (around 8.5\" x 11\"), you shouldn't have to change the document's size in the print dialog since letter/A4 is the default size for most printer paper."

To check if your printer can print on cardstock, look for the printer's technical or paper specifications in the manual or online. If the specs only list a paper weight and not a paper type, check if the accepted range includes between 65lb and 110lb (the weight range for cardstock paper). [1] X Research source"

If your friend is okay with you printing a big print job, consider offering to reimburse them for the ink used to finish printing everything."

If nothing else works, you can print your document or project on normal printer paper, and then glue it to a thick piece of cardstock or even some cardboard. This option is not recommended for something professional like an invitation or a business card, but it can work in a pinch for a school project or a craft."
