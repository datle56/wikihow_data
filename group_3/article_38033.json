      "content": "Buy 365 Everyday Value products. Whole Foods’ generic brand is typically cheaper. Like most grocery stores, Whole Foods has a generic brand that competes against name-brand items. 365 Everyday Value products are usually less expensive and taste similar to name-brand products, so they can help keep your grocery budget in check without sacrificing quality.

Whole Foods puts the environment first, and that includes their bag policy! Some stores encourage customers to use their reusable bags and earn $0.10 towards their total. All it requires is a one-time purchase of a Whole Foods reusable bag . [8] X Research source Keep in mind that this isn’t available for every store, so ask your store’s manager if something like this is offered. Be aware that some cities and states require grocery stores to pay for plastic bags, making using a reusable bag much more cost-effective."

      "title": "Buy leftover cheese.",
      "content": "Buy leftover cheese. Whole Foods packages leftover cheese pieces for you to purchase. Cheese can get expensive, especially at a higher-end grocery store like Whole Foods. Thankfully, Whole Foods knows this and has the perfect hack to help customers! Rather than throwing away leftover chunks of cheese that are too small to slice, the deli will package them and sell them at a lower price. These smaller pieces of leftover cheese can be found with the regular cheese by the deli."

      "title": "Avoid premade items.",
      "content": "Avoid premade items. Meals and dishes that are already made can be more expensive. Opt to buy individual ingredients rather than a premade meal at Whole Foods. While these meals are great in a pinch, they’re not ideal for your budget. Try cooking more of your meals yourself and freezing leftovers. [9] X Research source The same goes for prepackaged processed foods, like chips and candy. These are typically more expensive and can put a big dent in your budget, so it’s best to avoid them when you can."

    {
      "title": "Buy bulk items.",
      "content": "Buy bulk items. Buying just what you need can help you save money. Utilize Whole Foods’ extensive bulk aisle(s) to get amounts of everyday staples you know you’ll use. [10] X Research source Items are priced by weight so that you can be more efficient with your budget. For instance, say you love fresh nut butter but can never finish a jar before it spoils. At Whole Foods, you can make freshly churned nut butter in any size you like. As another example, prepackaged black beans typically cost $4.79 a pound, while bulk bin black beans cost $2.29 (a $2.50 savings)."

      "title": "Opt for frozen veggies over fresh.",
      "content": "Opt for frozen veggies over fresh. Frozen food lasts longer and is less expensive. While it may seem counterintuitive, frozen vegetables are usually fresher than fresh vegetables because frozen foods are packaged at peak freshness. [11] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source A frozen bag of broccoli may seem more expensive than a fresh head of broccoli, but you’re saving money in the long haul because frozen broccoli won’t spoil like fresh broccoli. This hack can be super helpful if you have trouble eating veggies before they go bad—less food waste means less money wasted!"

      "title": "Look for lesser-known meats.",
      "content": "Look for lesser-known meats. Meat can get expensive, so opt for budget-friendly cuts over fancier ones. Lesser-known cuts, such as boneless sirloin, flat iron steak, or skirt steak, can help fill your stomach without emptying your wallet. These meats are usually less expensive and taste just as great as your standard cuts. [12] X Research source"

      "title": "Purchase meat substitutes.",
      "content": "Purchase meat substitutes. Plant-based proteins are usually cheaper in the long haul. Even if you’re not on a plant-based or vegetarian diet, meat substitutes can generally be cheaper than real meat. So, if you’re trying to save a few bucks, opt for an Impossible Burger, jackfruit “pulled pork,” block of tofu, or go meatless. [13] X Research source"

      "title": "Shop the salad bar.",
      "content": "Shop the salad bar. Smaller amounts of veggies can be cheaper at the salad bar. Need a few vegetables for dinner but have a lower budget? Try selecting just what you need at the salad bar! Vegetables like lettuce, carrots, and cucumber can be purchased at a fraction of the price (plus, they’re already cut). This hack is great for a small, busy family or one-person household. Similarly, you can also ask an employee to cut something for you if you don’t need the whole thing, like half a cabbage, sandwich, fish filet, or chunk of cheese."

      "content": "Skip the sauces at the buffet. Sauces can add extra weight and dollar signs. Whole Foods is known for their fresh and delicious buffet options. However, it can be super easy to turn a cheap meal into something pricey if you have a heavy hand. Buffet boxes are priced based on weight, so avoid add-ons like sauces to keep your meal as cheap as possible. If you’re craving a sauce, consider buying a prepackaged one. While it may be pricier now, the investment will save you money."

      "title": "Look on higher and lower shelves.",
      "content": "Look on higher and lower shelves. The most expensive items are usually at eye level. Grocery stores want you to purchase the most expensive thing, so they’ll try to make bargains harder to find. [14] X Research source Pay attention to all of the shelf space, as budget-friendly goods tend to be on the top and bottom shelves. Similarly, try to be methodical about your shopping. Avoid aisles full of tempting or expensive treats. [15] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source"

      "content": "Ask for samples. Testing a product before you buy it can help you save money. Is there an item you’ve always wanted to try? Maybe it’s an expensive chocolate or fancy chicken dish. Either way, warranting a more indulgent purchase can be hard if you don’t know if you’ll like the product--which is where free samples come in! Many Whole Foods stores offer samples of trendy or new products. These samples can typically be found near a display or in an employee-run stand. [16] X Research source Most Whole Foods stores also allow customers to sample almost any type of ready-to-eat food. Just ask an employee!"
