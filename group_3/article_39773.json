      "content": "They won’t define the relationship. Questioning your relationship status is a sign you’re in a situationship. If you and your partner have been consistently dating for several months and they haven’t broached the subject or avoided it when you’ve brought it up, they probably don’t want a true relationship. [1] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source If you’ve only been dating for a few weeks or months, it might be too early to define the relationship. If you want a serious relationship and the labels that come with it, tell your partner in person . While it can be uncomfortable, it’s important to be direct and let your partner know what your needs are. You don’t have to settle for relationship limbo.

      "content": "They only make plans last minute. Pay attention to when your partner asks you to hang out. In a situationship, you might find that your partner only asks you on dates hours before or always texts you at night to come over. They might be treating you as a last option when they don’t have other plans and are bored. Let your partner know that this is a pattern of behavior with them. They might be unaware and work harder to make you a priority. However, if they continue to disrespect your time, it might be time to move on. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "They put in minimal effort in the relationship.",
      "content": "They put in minimal effort in the relationship. It is a red flag if you’re initiating every conversation, planning all the dates, and feeling like you’re getting nothing in return. A real relationship is equal and your partner should be excited to plan romantic dates and deepen your connection. [4] X Research source If your partner always flakes out or cancels your plans, that’s another red flag you’re in a situationship. Communicate to your partner that you feel like the relationship is one-sided. If they start to make an effort, that’s a good sign that they don’t want to lose you."

      "title": "Their communication is inconsistent.",
      "content": "Their communication is inconsistent. It’s a red flag if you don’t know when you’ll hear from your partner. You’ll know you’re in a situationship if you go days without a text or call from them, and then they respond as if nothing happened. This inconsistent communication can mean they’re not interested or invested in the relationship. [5] X Research source Don’t be afraid to let your partner know early on what your communication expectations are. This can help you avoid communication mishaps and will keep you on the same page."

      "title": "They don’t talk about your future together.",
      "content": "They don’t talk about your future together. In a relationship, you make space in your life for your partner and deepen your bond with shared long-term goals and activities. If they can’t commit to plans weeks into the future or refuse to talk about how you fit into their life long-term, they probably aren’t viewing the relationship seriously. [6] X Research source If this is bothering you, have a conversation with your partner. They might explain that their schedule is too busy to make plans or confess that they’re not looking for anything serious."

    {
      "title": "They only want a physical relationship.",
      "content": "They only want a physical relationship. A true relationship is a balance of emotional and physical intimacy. If your partner avoids being vulnerable and keeps you an arm's distance away, you’re probably in a situationship. It’s a red flag if they’re happy to call you for a hook-up but never start serious conversations that will take the relationship deeper. [7] X Research source It’s normal for a new relationship to be more surface level, but over time you should start opening up to each other and progressing the relationship to something more. If you and your partner have agreed to be friends with benefits and keep emotions out of the relationship, it’s completely fine to have a purely physical relationship. Start a deep conversation with your partner the next time you're over at their place instead of falling into your old pattern."

      "title": "They haven’t introduced you to friends and family.",
      "content": "They haven’t introduced you to friends and family. It’s a pretty big sign that you’re heading to serious relationship territory when your partner asks you to meet their friends or takes you home to their parents. If your partner’s in no hurry to show you off and avoids a conversation when you bring it up, they’re probably not interested in making the relationship serious. [8] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Be honest with your partner and tell them that you want to meet their friends and family. It’s possible that your partner has family issues they’ve been keeping from you, or isn’t at the same point in the relationship where they feel comfortable introducing you. [9] X Research source"

      "content": "They don’t want a serious relationship. This might seem like an obvious red flag that you’re in a situationship, but you might have hope that they’ll change their mind. Whether they’re not ready for a serious relationship or never will be, believe them when they say this, and don’t expect to change their mind when they tell you what they want. [10] X Research source It’s important for both you and your partner to want the same things out of the relationship. If you know they don’t want a serious relationship and you do, it might be time to move on."

      "content": "They’re dating other people. You might have deleted your apps and expected your partner to do the same, only to find out they’re still meeting other people. It’s important to have a conversation that you only want to date each other to avoid being blindsided that they’re not taking the relationship as seriously as you. [11] X Research source If you’ve communicated that your relationship is open or are in the early stages of dating, this probably isn’t a situationship red flag. When you know that you want to be exclusive with your partner, tell them. It’s important that you are both clear about how you’re feeling and what you want out of the relationship.

      "content": "Consider moving on if your relationship mainly makes you anxious and confused. While no relationship is perfect 100% of the time, you should be happy, satisfied, and excited to be with your partner. It’s not healthy to feel stressed, upset, or feel like you're in a relationship limbo without any clarity about what you are to your partner. [13] X Research source Bring up your feelings with your partner to let them know their actions are bothering you. Reader Poll: We asked 1399 wikiHow readers what they would do if they found out a girl was using them, and only 5% of them said ignore it and continue the relationship as is. [Take Poll] So, if you feel like you're being used and decide to move on, you wouldn't be alone."

It can be scary, but be clear with your partner about your needs and what you want out of the relationship. If they can’t give you a serious relationship or meet you halfway, it’s time to let the situations go. [14] X Research source Find a time to meet with your partner in person and end the relationship . Be honest and tell them they aren’t satisfying your needs so you need to move on.

If you’re happy without the pressures of a label and the seriousness of a relationship, it’s totally okay to be in a situationship.
