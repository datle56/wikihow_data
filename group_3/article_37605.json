While it’s possible to mount from the right side, most riders find it easier to mount from the left, and horses are more accustomed to being mounted from that side. Gathering the reins in your hand helps you control the horse as you mount. Rest your left hand with the reins on the horse’s neck if it’s comfortable. [1] X Research source Equestrian Specialist & Trainer Kate Jutagir says, \"If you’re a beginner, select a well-trained horse. Younger or poorly trained horses may shift and move during mounting. Choose an older horse with a reputation for being calm and cooperative during rides.\" [2] X Expert Source Kate Jutagir Equestrian Specialist & Trainer Expert Interview. 31 March 2020. Many riders find it useful to place their right hand on the top of the saddle to help push up."

With your foot in the stirrup, bounce on your right foot and push up with your left leg like you’re stepping up onto a tall step. [3] X Research source If you're a first-time rider, it's not a bad idea to use a mounting block or small wooden structure you stand on to mount the horse. Ask someone to hold the horse's head to help keep it steady as you mount. If someone doesn't hold the horse's head as you mount, hold the reins tightly in your left hand, but not so tightly that the horse backs away from the pressure."

Insert your right foot into the right stirrup. [4] X Research source Sink gently into the saddle as you mount the horse. Slamming down into the saddle may startle them or hurt their back. Certified Horsemanship Instructor Kathy Richardson says, “I tell people to mount like you're putting on a hat. You don't jam it on your head, and you don't drop your seat on the horse's back.” [5] X Expert Source Kathy Richardson Certified Horsemanship Instructor Expert Interview. 07 February 2024. Another good reason for using a mounting block is because it's easier on the horse’s back. You use less force to get on the horse and it takes less time to mount."

Once in the saddle, take a moment to make sure you're in the proper position for balance, with the bulk of your weight resting on the seat bones in your buttocks. Keep your back straight. Picture a straight line running through your ear, shoulder, hip, and heel. Square your shoulders so they’re even and straight. Suck in your belly button and tuck your tailbone under to support your lower back. [6] X Research source Don’t pull your shoulders back. Instead, lift your chest and sit as straight as possible.

Once you feel securely balanced, get your legs into the proper position with your heels lined up with your hips and your knees resting on the horse’s side. Think of it as hugging the horse with your legs. [7] X Research source Don’t squeeze the horse too tightly. Simply curve your legs inwards toward him. Proper leg placement can be tricky for beginning riders, so take time to position your legs. Many beginning riders turn their legs outward with their knees sticking out, which feels more natural.

The most common way is using your legs. Try gently squeezing your horse's side with your legs to signal them to walk. [11] X Research source If your horse doesn’t respond to this, they may need further prompting. Gently kick your horse with your heels. Use caution when kicking. While horses have thick hides, they may experience pain if you kick with too much force. A gentle tapping is generally all it takes to get a horse to walk. Depending on how a horse was trained, they may respond to tongue clicking or other noises. Ask the horse's trainer if they respond to any noises."

      "content": "Use the reins and your legs to signal direction. Steering in English style involves maintaining more contact with the horse’s mouth. To signal the horse to turn right, very lightly pull back with your right hand. To signal the horse to turn left, very lightly pull back with your left hand. If the horse doesn’t respond to the lighter pulling, gradually pull harder until the horse responds. [13] X Research source Use your legs and body to help signal a horse to move by slightly shifting in the direction you want to go while gently squeezing your leg. For example, squeeze your left leg if you want your horse to turn right, as the horse will want to move away from the pressure. Looking in the direction you wish to move helps. Richardson says, “You always want to be looking in the direction you want the horse to go. Their bodies are sensitive enough that they feel what we're doing.” [14] X Expert Source Kathy Richardson Certified Horsemanship Instructor Expert Interview. 07 February 2024."

Sit deep in the saddle and keep your legs in contact with the horse’s sides. Be careful to keep your elbows relaxed so you don't jerk on your horse's mouth. [15] X Research source Some riders prefer to do a posting or rising trot where they rise slightly out of the saddle instead of a sitting trot where they stay seated. This is often more comfortable as a trot is a bouncing gait. To do a posting trot , simply rise when the horse's outside shoulder moves forward and then gently sit back down in the saddle to avoid bouncing heavily on the horse's back."

      "content": "Move your outside leg back and squeeze to canter the horse. Cantering is a quicker three-beat speed that's natural to all horses. When you canter , your seat will roll with the canter, and you’ll stay in the position you normally ride in. Before you canter, make sure you’re comfortable with posting trot and sitting trot, as both of these are major points for cantering. Getting the timing right to get a horse to canter takes time. So make sure you get plenty of practice. [16] X Research source Try not to tense up. Most beginners find it beneficial to hold onto a saddle or neck strap while learning to canter. This helps with their balance so they don't fall. If your horse moves into a faster trot when you signal it to canter, ask them to walk and continue asking them to canter from the walk instead of the trot. Before cantering, gently squeeze your outside rein to slow your horse to a half halt in a trot before using your inside leg by the girth. Then, squeeze your outside leg behind the girth to give your horse a bit of a push forward."

However, hold off until you've mastered the basics. Spend at least a few months practicing the above techniques before trying anything new. Galloping and jumping are dangerous if you're inexperienced. Horseback riding is difficult and takes time and patience.

When riding Western , use a technique called \"neck reining.\" Neck reining means you hold the reins loosely and gently touch the horse's neck to signal movements. [19] X Research source To turn right, move the reins across the horse's neck to the right. To go left, move the reins across the horse's neck to the left. [20] X Research source Always hold the reins in your non-dominant hand with your other hand on your thigh. So, if you’re right-handed, hold the reins in your left hand and place your right hand on your right thigh. As with English riding, make sure you use your full body to steer as well. Use your legs and seatbones in addition to your hands. Use more direct reining, similar to the English style, in emergencies. To steer your horse quickly, temporarily switch to English-style steering. If your horse is not responding to neck reining, grab the reins in both hands. Gently pull or squeeze the left rein to turn left and the right rein to turn right. [21] X Research source"

Long strokes only move the dirt around. [28] X Research source Use a body brush to brush the horse's hair all over its body, including the belly and underline. Some horses are ticklish and may get fidgety when you brush their belly. Use a softer body brush to brush the horse’s face, moving with the grain of the hair. Avoid the eyes and be gentle around the nose and mouth. Use a mane-and-tail comb or soft brush on the horse’s mane and tail."
