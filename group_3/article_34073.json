Feel free to cut them into halves or small slivers, just try to keep all the pieces the same size and thickness.

Then, place each mushroom into the solution and let them sit for 5 minutes. Pat them dry with a paper towel after you take them out. If you don’t mind the mushrooms darkening, skip this step. [3] X Research source Treating the mushrooms with this solution will help them retain their color instead of darkening as they cook."

It should go all the way through but you should feel a little resistance from the meaty insides. The steaming time will depend on the size of the mushrooms.

Whole mushrooms will take 5 minutes to cook while quartered or slice mushrooms will take about 3 to 3 ½ minutes. [11] X Research source You may need to add more butter or oil if you’re cooking a large batch. Add any spices that you may want to have on your mushrooms. Basil, oregano, rosemary and thyme are great options. Mushrooms with smaller heads (like enoki and lion’s mane) will only take up to 2 minutes.
