      "content": "Pack one outfit for the first night and another for the next day. You’ll need 3 outfits for an overnight trip: the outfit you’re wearing when you leave, an outfit suitable for your evening plans at the destination, and a change of clothes for the next day. It’s always possible that something will happen and you’ll need to stay an extra night, but if you’re worried, you really only need to pack 1 extra shirt. [1] X Research source When choosing what to wear the first day while you travel, pick something comfortable, like jeans or leggings and a T-shirt. For example, bring a nicer outfit if you’ll be going out to lunch or dinner at your destination. [2] X Expert Source Sarah McDonald Certified Stylist & Image Consultant Expert Interview. 26 August 2021. For example, try a stylish blouse, button-down shirt and slacks, or a dress. Planning is essential whenever you pack for a trip. Be mindful of the events you have coming up, and make sure your dress code is right for the occasion.

      "content": "Bring a single pair of lightweight pajamas. You’ll only be away overnight, so you don’t need to weigh yourself down with any extra pairs. Bring a long-sleeved shirt and pajama pants if your destination is going to be chilly, or something smaller and thinner, like a t-shirt and sleeping shorts, if your destination is warm. This will save space and keep you comfortable while you sleep. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Wear a pair of comfy shoes for travel and pack a second pair.",
      "content": "Wear a pair of comfy shoes for travel and pack a second pair. Overnight trips usually require 2 pairs of shoes: one to wear most of the time and another if there’s an event or activity that might require a change of shoes. To save space, wear your regular shoes while traveling and store the second pair in your bag. Plus, if you don’t need a second pair of shoes, you can wear a single pair and be done with it! [5] X Research source You’ll really only need a second pair of shoes if you’re going somewhere with a specific dress code. For example, if you have a fancy event that night, pack a nice pair of shoes—like heels or dress shoes."

    {
      "title": "Bring a pair of clean underwear and socks.",
      "content": "Bring a pair of clean underwear and socks. Since you’re only traveling for one night, there’s typically no need to pack more than 1 pair of underwear and 1 pair of socks. However, if you’re worried about your trip being delayed, you can always include an extra pair of underwear just in case. Similarly, if rainy weather is a concern, throw an extra pair of socks in your bag in case the first gets wet. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Include only the accessories you need to keep your bag free of clutter.",
      "content": "Include only the accessories you need to keep your bag free of clutter. Do you usually wear accessories like jewelry, belts, watches, or sunglasses? It’s okay to bring those with you—but try not to empty your entire jewelry box into your bag! Think about what outfits you’ll wear and what accessories match them best. Then, pack those accessories and leave the rest at home. [7] X Research source Consider accessories that might come in handy at your destination. For a colder climate, throw a scarf into your bag or wear it while traveling. To prevent jewelry chains from knotting, pack your jewelry in plastic bags and pull a bit of the chain out. Zip up the bag tightly around the piece of chain, leaving it sticking out of the top."

      "title": "Reuse your day 1 travel clothes for your return trip, if possible.",
      "content": "Reuse your day 1 travel clothes for your return trip, if possible. If you don’t have much planned for the next day beyond the trip back home, you probably won’t need another change of clothes. Just throw on the same travel outfit you wore the day before, and save space in your bag. This might give you room to sneak in other things—like a second pair of shoes or a hair straightener! Always bring as many reusable or multi-purpose items as possible on trips. For example, a soft beach towel could double as a blanket, or you could bring a metal water bottle instead of a disposable plastic one."

      "content": "Pack optional items like workout clothes or a swimsuit if you’ll need them. Will you be staying at a hotel with a pool or gym? Do you plan to visit a nearby beach when you arrive? Swimsuits are lightweight and don’t take up much room—so if there’s a chance you’ll go swimming, bring it along to be safe. Workout clothes might also be a good idea, but only if you absolutely plan to use them. [8] X Research source"

      "title": "Check the weather forecast at your destination.",
      "content": "Check the weather forecast at your destination. If you’re traveling to a different area overnight, see if conditions like rain, cold, or extreme heat are in the forecast using services like Weather.com . Then, choose your clothing based on the conditions you'll be facing when you arrive. This is extremely important because nobody wants to end up unprepared or even sick when traveling. If it’s raining, bring an umbrella or raincoat and leave your best leather shoes (since you don’t want to damage them outside). If temperatures look high during the day and night, bring light, breathable outfits and save room in your bag by leaving your heavy jacket at home."

      "content": "Prepare layered outfits so you’re ready for any situation. Checking the weather is all well and good, but it never hurts to be prepared in case it gets unexpectedly hot (or cold) despite the forecast. So, what’s the trick to dealing with unexpected weather? Layers! Make sure you pack pieces of clothing that can be layered on top of each other so you’re dressed for anything. [9] X Research source For example: Even if you’re mostly bringing warm-weather clothes, pack a jacket to throw on in case the nights are chilly. If it’s supposed to be cold out, wear a short-sleeve shirt under your sweater and jacket in case the weather gets warmer or you get a little overheated while indoors."

If you wear makeup, bring along some makeup wipes and your normal facial cleanser. Ask your hotel if they provide things like shampoo, conditioner, and body wash—or, if you’re staying with a friend, ask to borrow theirs.

      "content": "Prepare a mini medicine kit. It’s always a good idea to be prepared for medical issues, even on overnight trips. Put together a personalized medicine kit with any medications you’re currently taking, plus medicines that might come in handy during transit. For example, is it allergy season? Bring an antihistamine. Do you get headaches when you fly? Bring a pain reliever like Tylenol. [11] X Research source You don’t need to bring whole bottles of medicine if you’re just traveling overnight. Instead, fill a pill organizer with as much medicine as you need (or pack 1 extra dose if you’re worried about running out)."

Make your own little hygiene kit with everything you’ll need to stay healthy and clean on your trip, including hand sanitizer, wet wipes, tissues, a face mask, and—if you or a traveling companion menstruates—as many sanitary pads or tampons as you might need. [12] X Research source Remember, you don’t need more than a small bottle of hand sanitizer—and a bigger bottle will just be harder to fit in your bag."

Since you’re only going away overnight, you’ll really only need the essential makeup products in your collection. If you know you’ll be wearing makeup, limit yourself to packing 10 products (or less) in your bag to conserve space.

      "content": "Pack only travel-size (or TSA-approved) toiletries in your bag. Big bottles of shampoo, hair straighteners, and blow dryers will take up lots of room in your bag. Pour liquid products into smaller, travel-size containers so you can ditch all the large bottles, and check ahead to see if things like blow dryers will be provided at your destination so you won’t have to pack them. [14] X Research source Check the TSA guidelines on sizes for containers of liquids, gels, and creams before you fly. Even if you’re not flying, adhering to the guidelines by choosing smaller containers can help you save space."

      "content": "Stick to portable electronics unless you need your laptop for work. There’s really no need for heavy electronics on an overnight trip. Nowadays, a phone or tablet will have just about everything you’ll need—including music and apps. Leave behind game consoles, chunky headphones, and even laptops if you can. Instead, bring your phone, charging cord, and a pair of earbuds. [15] X Research source It’s okay to bring your laptop if you know you’ll need it for work—the goal is simply to pack as lightly as possible. Consider bringing a power bank or portable charger to ensure your phone won’t die when you still need it."

Download a few gaming apps onto your phone, or make a playlist so you can listen to music as you travel. If you have room in your bag, you could even bring a thin book of crossword puzzles, sudoku, or word searches for boredom-banishing activities on the go.

      "content": "Use a duffel, backpack, or large tote bag to hold all of your things. You’ll only be gone for the night, so ditch the suitcases and bring a small, lightweight, and easy-to-carry overnight bag. Opt for something like a small duffel, a backpack, a large tote—or, at most, a small roll-aboard bag. Using a small bag will help you pack efficiently since it’ll only have room for the essentials anyway! Try not to fill more than one travel bag for an overnight trip; more will likely be unnecessary and weigh you down. Downsize if you find yourself needing another bag to fit everything. The goal for an overnight trip should be to have 2 bags total: a purse or crossbody bag for small essentials you’ll keep on your person and an overnight bag with all your clothing and toiletries."

      "content": "Cover your shoes and place them at the bottom of the bag. No matter how pristine your shoes look, they’ve still been all over the ground (unless they’re brand new). To keep them from getting scuffed up in transit and protect your clothes from stray bits of dirt, put your shoes inside shoe bags (or a plastic grocery bag, if needed) before packing them at the bottom of your bag. Alternatively, if you’ve already packed your bag and need to squeeze a pair of shoes in, try packing them along the side of the bag. Arrange your shoes so that the soles are facing the side of the bag."

      "title": "Roll each article of clothing before packing them.",
      "content": "Roll each article of clothing before packing them. One of the best ways to save space in an overnight bag is by rolling your clothes instead of folding them flat. To roll a shirt, simply lay it flat and fold the sleeves towards the center of the shirt. Then, roll the shirt from hem to collar, smoothing out wrinkles as you go. Roll pants and skirts similarly—lay them flat, fold them, and roll them up while eliminating as many wrinkles as possible. [17] X Research source Folding your clothes is also a viable option if you prefer; rolling is just the most efficient when you need to save space. Try stuffing your socks in bras or sneakers to save space. Your socks can also help the bra cups or sneaker toes keep their shape in transit."

      "title": "Organize your belongings with clear cubes and pouches.",
      "content": "Organize your belongings with clear cubes and pouches. Before throwing everything into your overnight bag, try separating your belongings into categories. First, pack your rolled clothing into a small clear packing cube . Then, fill one clear pouch with your toiletries, one with your medicine kit, and another with your hygiene kit. That way, you can easily sort through everything in your bag and find what you need! [18] X Research source As you pack your clothes, stack them from heaviest to lightest. Place heavy jackets near the bottom of the cube, then pants and jeans, dresses, and shirts near the top. If you're packing a blazer or suit, keep it in a garment bag to avoid wrinkles and damage instead of packing it like everything else. [19] X Expert Source Sarah McDonald Certified Stylist & Image Consultant Expert Interview. 26 August 2021. If possible, pack an anti-wrinkle spray to avoid problems with wrinkled clothes.

      "content": "Bring a smaller purse, crossbody, or spare foldable bag. If you’re going to be on the move during your trip, you probably won’t want to lug your overnight bag everywhere. Instead, bring a separate smaller bag, like a purse or crossbody bag, and tuck your phone, charger, earbuds, and other small essentials like your wallet and ID cards inside it. Then, just drop your overnight bag off at the hotel when you arrive! Have a few charging cords to manage? Keep them from tangling by rolling each one into a circle or oval, then clipping them together with a binder clip. Any chance you’ll go swimming or talk a stroll down a beach? If your clothes might get wet, bring another spare foldable bag to put them in so you can keep them separate from your clean belongings."

      "content": "Do your hair and makeup before you leave. If you only have a short trip ahead of you, save space in your bag by styling your hair and putting on makeup before you head out.

      "title": "Be realistic about what you’ll actually need and what’s unnecessary.",
      "content": "Be realistic about what you’ll actually need and what’s unnecessary. During the packing process, it’s easy to start asking yourself too many “What ifs” and packing for activities you probably won’t get to. Remind yourself what you’ll be doing on your trip, and only pack exactly what you’ll need for that itinerary. You don’t need to overpack for things you won’t end up doing! [21] X Research source For example, if you’re traveling for an overnight business conference, you probably won’t have time to do a ton of exploring and sightseeing—so don’t bring your chunky walking shoes."
