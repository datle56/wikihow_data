      "content": "Pay attention to chest pain. A pain in the chest, whether it's sharp or dull, is the most common sign of a heart attack. People who are having heart attacks often say they feel squeezing, fullness, pressure, tightness, or a sharp sensation in the center or left area of the chest. This feeling may last a few minutes or more, or disappear and return later. [3] X Trustworthy Source Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Main public health institute for the US, run by the Dept. of Health and Human Services Go to source Chest pain that stems from a heart attack is not always the crushing, heavy feeling that some people describe - often called the \"Hollywood\" heart attack. It can actually be quite mild, so don't ignore any type of chest pain. \"Retrosternal\" chest pain is commonly felt. This refers to a pain behind the breastbone, or sternum. It is easy to confuse this pain with abdominal discomfort, like gas. If you have any doubt about this pain, call a doctor. Keep in mind that chest pain is not always present when a heart attack is occurring; in fact, over half of heart attack patients don't experience chest pain. Don't rule out the possibility of a heart attack just because you aren't hurting in that area."

Sometimes the pain from a heart attack radiates from the chest area outward, causing discomfort in the neck, jaw, abdomen, upper back, and the left arm. [4] X Research source Domino, F. (n.d.). In The 5-minute clinical consult standard 2015 (23rd ed.) The pain in these areas is usually a dull ache. If you haven't recently worked out or done anything that could cause upper body soreness, this type of pain could be a sign you're having a heart attack."

Shortness of breath may be your only heart attack symptom. Do not take it lightly!

A change in normal patterns is the most important thing to watch for. If you have what you believe to be painful indigestion, you may actually be experiencing angina.
