That’s what little girls are made of.” – Bethany Hamilton “The first lesson every child of Athena learned: Mom was the best at everything, and you should never, ever suggest otherwise.” – Rick Riordan “Having a little girl has been like following an old treasure map with the important paths torn away.” – Heather Gudenkauf “If evolution really works, how come mothers only have two hands?” – Milton Berle “My mom is literally a part of me.

If so, they deserve recognition in the same way that a birth mother would—and you can celebrate them with any one of these fitting captions; “Biology is the least of what makes someone a mother.” – Oprah Winfrey In her embrace, I find a mother’s warmth, a friend’s understanding, and a mentor’s wisdom ❤️ To the one who stepped into the role of a mother effortlessly, your love is my greatest gift 🎁 A mother in every way that matters, her love echoes in the rhythm of my heartbeat 🎧🫀 She may not have given me life, but she gives me love in abundance—a mother in every sense.
