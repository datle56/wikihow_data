      "title": "Identify a sale site.",
      "content": "Identify a sale site. Selling your washer/dryer on an online classified platform can be extra work, but gives you the most control over the process, and because you will be cutting out the middle man, is the most likely method to yield the best price. First you will need to identify where you want to list your appliance. A few common common classified sites you could list on are Craigslist, Ebay, and classifiedads.com."
    },
    {
      "title": "Identify your specific model.",
      "content": "Identify your specific model. You will need to identify not just the manufacturer, but also the model number and series number, which will be located on an etched metal plate somewhere on the machine. Note that it might be on the back of the appliance or under the lid. [1] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Look for your model online to determine how much it is selling for.",
      "content": "Look for your model online to determine how much it is selling for. Once you've identified your make and model, do some internet research to discover what price other similar appliances are selling for, not just on the classified sit you will be using, but on others as well."

      "title": "List your washer/dry for a reasonable price on the site you've chosen.",
      "content": "List your washer/dry for a reasonable price on the site you've chosen. Each site will have its own standards for how to list appliances. Make sure you follow these instructions for best results. [2] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Describe the appliance in your ad.",
      "content": "Describe the appliance in your ad. Include information about make, model, condition, and whether any repairs are needed. Emphasize the positive attributes of your washer dryer, but be honest about any issues it has. Potential buyers will be much more bothered by defects if they feel you are trying to hide or downplay them. [3] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Take a high-quality photo of the appliance you are trying to sell.",
      "content": "Take a high-quality photo of the appliance you are trying to sell. Including a professional looking photograph in your listing can help your appliance to sell, by helping potential buyers to visualize the item in question. Make sure your camera has good resolution and adequate lighting. [4] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Be patient.",
      "content": "Be patient. Selling an appliance on a classified website can take time. If you need the appliance sold immediately, you should consider another selling option. Lowering the list price can also help the item to sell in some situations, but is no guarantee, and lowering the price too much might give the impression that the appliance is defective or damaged.

    {
      "title": "Shop around for dealers in your area.",
      "content": "Shop around for dealers in your area. Selling directly to a used appliance dealer is generally the fastest and easiest method of disposal, although you might not get as much for your washer/dryer as you would if you sold directly through a classified site. Checking local businesses listings like yellowpages.com is the best way to get started."
    },
    {
      "title": "Contact the dealer and confirm their prices.",
      "content": "Contact the dealer and confirm their prices. Most dealers can be contacted online, but you will get faster and more accurate information by calling them. As with classified selling, the more information you have, the better your outcomes will be. Before settling on a dealer, you should find out what prices they pay for used appliances."
    },
    {
      "title": "Call more than one dealer to get the best offer.",
      "content": "Call more than one dealer to get the best offer. Speaking to several retailers about how much your appliance is worth will provide the best opportunity to get a good price. Used appliance retailers compete with each other to woo sellers like you, so the more you know about the prices other sellers are offering, the more likely you are to get the best price."
    },
    {
      "title": "Don't be afraid to negotiate.",
      "content": "Don't be afraid to negotiate . You know what your washer/dryer is worth, so insist on getting the price you want. Retailers are accustomed to this kind of back-and-forth negotiation, so the first price they quote you will rarely be the best one. Be prepared, and have knowledge of both the value of your appliance, and the offers you have received from other sellers."
    },
    {
      "title": "Arrange for pickup.",
      "content": "Arrange for pickup. Most used appliance retailers will be willing to pickup the appliance for free. Since this is one of the chief perks of selling to a retailer, you should insist on it. You are most likely accepting a lower price in order to avoid the hassle of selling directly through a classified site, so make sure you are getting the the most from the convenience of this method."

    {
      "title": "Identify an organization that will accept washer/dryers.",
      "content": "Identify an organization that will accept washer/dryers. There are many charitable groups that collect lightly used appliances for donation, and national charities generally have a donation center in most metropolitan areas. Some national charities that commonly accept appliance donation are Habitat for Humanity ReStore, Goodwill Industries, The Salvation Army, and American Council for the Blind. [6] X Research source You could also consider a local community organization or place of worship. Many cities, towns, and neighborhoods have community organizations that help to distribute donations to those in need. In addition, many churches, synagogues, mosques, and other places of worship will know how to receive or organize donations."

    {
      "title": "Ask whether they need your donation.",
      "content": "Ask whether they need your donation. With donation centers, it is a good idea to call ahead and find out if they are collecting appliances like yours at this time. Sometimes, charity groups may have enough washer/dryers to fulfill their needs at a given time, or may not have space to store it. In this case, you can wait until a later date, or choose another charity to donate to."

    {
      "title": "Arrange for pickup.",
      "content": "Arrange for pickup. You should also find out if the organization picks up. Many charities have volunteers, who pickup used appliances from donors, but some will require you to transport your own donation. If this is a problem for you, you may need to enlist help in transporting the appliance, or consider a different charity. [7] X Research source"

      "title": "Document your donation.",
      "content": "Document your donation. In the U.S., the IRS requires you to document donations over $250 in order to receive the tax benefit. Most charitable organizations provide you with form 8283 at the time of your donation. If you do not receive one, simply ask for a donation receipt, and store it with your tax materials.
