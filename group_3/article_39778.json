      "title": "Put your watch on.",
      "content": "Put your watch on. Before you begin, you'll need to decide what changes you need to make. In most cases you'll be removing links. If the watch is only slightly loose, you'll probably want to leave it as-is. If the watch is too tight, contact Casio. They may be able to send you additional links or send you a watch with an oversize band."
    },
    {
      "title": "Center the watch on your wrist.",
      "content": "Center the watch on your wrist. By centering the face of the watch on your wrist, you'll be able to see how much extra slack you have on each side. You will want the watch to be comfortable. Some slack will keep it from pinching you, but the watch will be able to move on your arm with too much slack."
    },
    {
      "title": "Decide how many links you need to remove.",
      "content": "Decide how many links you need to remove. You can do this using a tape measure if you'd like, but estimating usually works better. For a watch that is slightly too loose you'll want to remove one link. If it is much too loose you'll need to remove two or more."
    },
    {
      "title": "Remove the watch and ready your tools.",
      "content": "Remove the watch and ready your tools. You will want to get a small nail with a long tip and a high quality, precision flat head screwdriver. The head of the screwdriver will ideally be under 2mm wide. If you have a jeweler's screwdriver, it would be ideal. You may also find it helpful to work over a soft, smooth, and clean surface. A white towel or tee shirt works well. That way if you drop your nail or any of the small parts of the watch they'll be safe and easy to find."
    },
    {
      "title": "Find the links with arrows.",
      "content": "Find the links with arrows. Don't try to remove a link that doesn't have arrows on the underside. The links with arrows are removable links. [1] X Research source You'll notice that the removable links aren't near the edges of the band. Also, remember that you want the watch to be centered on your wrist, so you'll need to take links from both sides of the band if you are taking more than one out."
    },
    {
      "title": "Choose your link pin and place the nail.",
      "content": "Choose your link pin and place the nail. You'll see a small hole on one side of the band. [2] X Research source While firmly gripping the watch, tap on the nail head until you see a small peg poke out of the other side of the band. You will also a niche exposed under the arrow. If you look closely, one end of the pins is solid and the other has a faint line through it. You want to tap the solid side. When tapping the solid side you should only need to push it about a quarter of an inch before it slides out."
    },
    {
      "title": "Put the screwdriver in the small niche.",
      "content": "Put the screwdriver in the small niche. Gently start sliding the pin down. [3] X Research source The pin will usually drop out easily, but if it does not you can use needle-nosed pliers to withdraw it. Catch the pin and gently remove the link if it does not fall off on its own."
    },
    {
      "title": "Save the link and the pin.",
      "content": "Save the link and the pin. [4] X Research source Now that you have successfully removed your link(s), you will want to be sure to set them aside, in case you have removed too many links and the watch is now too small."
    },
    {
      "title": "Reattach the band.",
      "content": "Reattach the band. Carefully align the remaining links. Once the links are aligned, reinsert the pin to close the loop of the band. [5] X Research source If you were going to be removing multiple links, proceed with a link from the other side of the watch band."
    },
    {
      "title": "Test the fit.",
      "content": "Test the fit. Try on your watch! If it is still too loose, remove another link. If it is too tight, replace a link. Congratulations. You are now looking sharp with a properly sized Casio on your wrist."
    },
    {
      "title": "Adjust the fine tuning.",
      "content": "Adjust the fine tuning. At one end of the clasp there are two holes for attaching the wrist band to the clasp. You can adjust the length for about half-link by moving the point of attachment of the link. Note that the connection is done with a spring pin, which can be extracted by pressing one of the visible ends. Be careful as these pins have the habit of shooting out when liberated from the clasp. Use the flat end of a screwdriver to push the end of the pin into the clasp and guide it into the appropriate hole."
