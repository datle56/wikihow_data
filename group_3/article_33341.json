      "content": "Draw 6 tiles into your hand from the bag. If it’s your first time playing, toss all of the tiles into the drawstring bag and shake it up to give them a good mix. All players pull 6 tiles out of the bag for your starting hand, but keep them hidden from other players so they can’t see what you have. Every tile will have a colored shape on it. [1] X Research source There are 6 different colors and 6 different shapes, so Qwirkle has 36 different tiles. There are 3 copies of each tile for a total of 108 tiles."

      "content": "Determine the first player. Look at your hand of tiles and count how many tiles share one characteristic, either a single color or a single shape. Tell the other players how many tiles are in your largest group, and whoever says the biggest number takes the first turn. [2] X Research source Example: If your hand has a red square, red circle, blue circle, green circle, orange diamond, and purple star, your largest group would be the 3 circles. If there’s a tie for who has the largest group, then whoever’s older goes first."

      "content": "Play 1 or more tiles to start the grid. If you’re the first player, you get to start building the play area, which is also called the grid . You can choose to play 1 tile, or any number of tiles of a single color or a single shape. [4] X Research source Two tiles that touch each other form a line and need to be either the same shape or the same color. Try to play 2 or more tiles when you’re starting the game since you’ll earn more points."

      "title": "Add 1 or more tiles to the grid when it’s your turn.",
      "content": "Add 1 or more tiles to the grid when it’s your turn. You can play 1 tile, or multiple tiles that either share the same color or the same shape. The catch is, the tile you play has to connect to another tile that’s already been played. There are a few restrictions on where you can place the tiles as well. The placement restrictions are: [5] X Research source A line of the same color can only have one tile in each shape. Example: You can only have one yellow square in a line. A line of the same shape can only have one tile of each color. Example: You can only have one blue star in a line of stars. When you add the tiles to the grid, they all have to go into the same line. However, you can place your tiles on either end of the line. As you build out the grid, you’ll restrict where other players can put their tiles and some spots might get blocked off."

Draw that many new tiles from the bag and put them in your hand so you have 6 tiles. Then, put the tiles you set aside back in the bag.

[10] X Research source Example: If you add 2 tiles to the end of a line that already has 2 tiles, then you’ll earn 4 points. Example: If you play blue square on the end of a line with 2 other squares and then connect a blue circle to the blue square, you’ll earn a total of 5 points.

You’ll earn big points for adding to more than one line in your turn, and it can give you a big advantage. [14] X Research source Search the board for corners made by the lines and see if you have any matching colors or shapes. Example: If there’s an empty space with a green star to the left and a blue square above it, you could play a green square in the space for 4 points!"
