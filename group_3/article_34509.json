      "content": "Save all text messages or voicemails. When you receive a message from the person against whom you have a no-contact order, your first impulse may be to delete it immediately. However, if you want to prove a no-contact order has been broken, you need to preserve it as evidence. [1] X Research source [2] X Research source Actual physical evidence of direct contact is essentially all you need to prove the person broke the no-contact order. The person would have little argument against it, aside from perhaps claiming that someone had stolen their phone and contacted you without their consent. A voicemail message in which the person's voice actually can be heard would be almost impossible to defend against, particularly if the content of that message makes it clear that the person intended to contact you. Messages or comments on social media also constitute a violation of a no-contact order in this sense. Technically you probably should block the person from your social media accounts, but if you haven't, save any messages they send or comments they make. Try to save the original form of the message to the extent possible – meaning you should retain it in your phone or on your social media account rather than deleting it. However, you also want to print it out or screen-cap it if possible so you have an additional record that can't be easily altered after the fact."

      "content": "Talk to witnesses. Anyone who was there when the other person broke the no-contact order can potentially testify on your behalf. Witnesses are particularly important if the contact occurred in person, rather than online or over the phone. [3] X Trustworthy Source WomensLaw.org Site associated with the National Network to End Domestic Violence aimed at providing free legal resources and aid to survivors of domestic violence. Go to source Keep in mind that \"no contact\" truly does mean no contact whatsoever. According to the letter of the order, the person isn't even allowed to say \"hi\" to you if they happen to pass you on the street. However, if the person does violate the no-contact order face-to-face, proving that violation potentially could become a \"he said, she said\" situation if the other person denies the contact took place. Under those circumstances, having witnesses to the contact can help reinforce your story and prove that the no-contact order was broken. Witnesses are particularly important if the contact was indirect. No-contact orders typically prohibit both direct or indirect contact, meaning that the restrained person tried to communicate with you through another person. In this situation, getting testimony from the person used to transmit the message to you is crucial. They must be able to say that the restrained person gave them a message to give to you."

      "content": "Consult your attorney. Typically a no-contact order is entered in conjunction with another legal case, such as a divorce case or a domestic violence matter. If you hired an attorney to work with you on the main case, call them immediately. [4] X Research source [5] X Research source If you don't have an attorney, you may want to consider talking to one anyway. You typically can get legal assistance by visiting a nonprofit domestic violence organization. Additionally, most family law attorneys give a free initial consultation. The prosecuting attorney may end up filing criminal charges against the person who violated the no-contact order. However, they don't represent you – they represent the state. In fact, when it comes to no-contact orders, your wishes are irrelevant. The order may have been entered against your wishes, and will be enforced against your wishes. In other words, if you later decide you don't want to go forward with prosecution for violation of the no-contact order, too bad. The prosecutor can go ahead and file charges anyway."

      "content": "Avoid breaking the order yourself. It doesn't change the fact that the other person violated the order. However, no-contact orders often run both ways. If you have also broken the no-contact order, you may find yourself subject to the same penalties. Even if your no-contact order is not reciprocal, meaning it only binds one party, it's still best to avoid contacting the person yourself. While it isn't a defense to a violation of a no-contact order for the person to say that you contacted them first, it definitely won't help your case in court."

Someone who breaks a no-contact order is subject to arrest. However, avoid calling 911 unless there is a real emergency. [9] X Research source [10] X Research source If you run into the person, or they come to your house and are threatening you or making you fear for your personal safety or that of your loved ones, don't hesitate to call 911. Keep in mind that in most states, if the police witness a person violating a no-contact order, they must arrest the person immediately. However, if the contact in question is more passive, just a text or a message on social media, call the police non-emergency number or go down to the station in person."

The officer will listen to your account and write the information up into an official police report. [11] X Research source [12] X Research source Ideally, you want to talk to an officer in person to file your report. That way you can show them the no-contact order and any other court papers associated with the situation. Going down to the police station in person also is especially important if the person contacted you online, over the phone, or through the mail, rather than in person.

Make sure you have a copy of the report for your records. [13] X Research source [14] X Research source If there are other people involved, you may want to make copies for them as well. For example, if you have children with the person, you may want to give copies to any of the children's caregivers, or to their school.

The police also may contact you if they are having trouble locating the individual. They may want additional information regarding where the person lives or works, places they frequent, or the locations of friends or relatives. If the person attempts to contact you again, make sure you call the police to update your report. Reference the number on your police report so they can add the information to the right case."

They will talk to you about the incident in the police report and ask if the person has made any further attempts to talk to you. If you have any physical evidence, the prosecuting attorney will want copies. They also may ask you about the events that led to the judge entering the no-contact order, and try to get a sense of any other legal matters you may have pending, such as a divorce, that also involve the same person.

The prosecutor also may ask whether you know if the order was successfully served on the person. The level of proof required here varies among states. In some states, it isn't necessary to prove that the defendant was legally served with the order. The prosecutor only has to prove that the defendant knew about it.

If the restrained person is claiming that they did not willfully contact you, the defense attorney may ask you questions about the way in which you received the message and whether others were included. For example, if the restrained person sent a message to an email list on which you were included, but they weren't aware that you were included on the list and the message wasn't intended specifically for you, the judge may find they did not violate the no-contact order."

Violation of a no-contact order typically is considered a separate criminal charge. The judge may require the person who violated the order to pay a fine of several thousand dollars, or to spend a short time in jail. If the person has been convicted of multiple violations, or if the violation included an assault against you, the person may face no criminal felony charges. This would result in a more extended jail sentence and more significant fines."
