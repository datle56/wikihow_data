      "content": "Owl hoots can represent transformation & rebirth. Since owls are associated with the spirit realm, they are often thought of as omens of death. It’s important to note, however, that owl hoots may foretell a metaphorical death, rather than a physical one. In other words, the owl’s call may be a sign that it’s time to let go of an old version of yourself in order to transform into the person you’re meant to be. For example, it might be time to end a toxic relationship that isn’t serving you. The “death” of this partnership makes room for you to find the person you’re truly supposed to be with. Or, it could be time to leave a job you’re not happy with to explore a new, more fulfilling career path. Whatever your situation, the owl’s hoot encourages you to embrace change, rather than fearing it, in order to become the best version of yourself."
