      "content": "Look for a street sign to help narrow down the location. Use the compass icon to rotate the image, keeping your eyes peeled for a street sign with a name you can plug into a search engine. The +/- icon at the bottom-right of the image allows you to zoom in and out to get a better look. The Password Game uses Google Earth, so the street is sometimes superimposed onto the image. Unfortunately, this tip works better with a street name like Goosedubbs (Scotland) than Oak Street, a very common street name in any English-speaking country‚Ä¶though that‚Äôs helpful to know, too."

      "content": "Identify any pictured languages that appear in the image. As you examine the image, look for writing on buildings, vehicles, and signs. Identifying a language may not tell you exactly what country you‚Äôre looking at, but it can help you narrow things down. Do you see Spanish writing? Or maybe something written in a completely different alphabet? Once you identify the language, search for countries where it is the official language. For example, if you see signs in German, your list of countries would include Germany, Austria, Belgium, Luxembourg, Switzerland, and Liechtenstein. If you speak the language, try searching the internet for any business names to help you identify the country. Don‚Äôt forget to check any vehicle license plates in the image for a country. In some cases, these are blurred out and not helpful, but you might get lucky and find the answer right away!"

      "content": "Find a phone number or website to identify the country. Scan the image for a string of numbers or letters that could be a business phone number or web address. Phone numbers have a country code that identifies the home country of the number when using it to make an international call. Additionally, countries have top-level domains (the letters after the final . in a web address) associated with them. For example, the country telephone code for France is 33, so if you see a number that begins with +33 the image may have been taken there. The top-level domain for France is .fr, so if you see a web address that ends with that, the image may have been taken in France. Search for country codes for phone numbers at CountryCode.org . Search for top-level domains for countries at WorldStandards.eu ."

      "content": "Use popular landmarks and architecture to help you find a region. Famous landmarks are easy. If you see the Taj Mahal in the image, you know right away the picture was taken in India. Types of architecture are a little trickier, but they can also be helpful in targeting an area. For example, if you see Gothic architecture, the location in the image is probably somewhere in Western Europe. If you see Abbasid architecture, the image may have been taken in North Africa, the Middle East, or possibly Spain. [1] X Research source If you‚Äôre unsure about the architecture, scan the image for religious iconography. For example, an image with a crucifix may point to a country with a large Catholic population."

While trying to figure out where the image was taken on your own can be fun, it might be easier to take a screen capture of the image and do a reverse image search . [2] X Research source A reverse image search often gives you the name of the country, city, or prominent landmark in the image. If it doesn‚Äôt have the country, just type whatever information it gives you into a search engine to find it."

      "content": "Convert 1x35 or 5x7 to Roman numerals to solve Rule 9. Rule 9 of the Password Game asks you to add Roman numerals to your password that multiply to 35. Luckily, there are only a few numbers that equal 35 when you multiply them together. Once you have your numbers, convert them to Roman numerals. Easy-peasy, right? The only numbers that multiply to 35 are 1x35 and 5x7. In Roman numerals, they are IxXXXV and VxVII. When you add the Roman numerals to your password, remember to separate them with a lowercase ‚Äúx,‚Äù or the game will interpret them as a different Roman numeral, and you won‚Äôt pass."

Rule 18 asks that the elements‚Äô atomic numbers in your password add up to 200. Use the periodic table to find the atomic numbers of the symbols you included in Rule 12 and add them up. Swap out elements to raise or lower the total until the atomic numbers add up to 200. Be careful, though. Some elements have symbols that are single capital letters. If those capital letters appear in your password, they count toward the atomic number total for Rule 18. The Roman numerals I and V are also symbols for elements. Their atomic numbers count toward Rule 18, but you can‚Äôt just make them lowercase, or they won‚Äôt count for Rule 12. C is the Roman numeral for 100‚Ä¶and the symbol for carbon. Avoid using it for Rule 18 so you don‚Äôt break Rule 12."
