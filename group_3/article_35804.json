      "content": "Place the breadsticks side-by-side in an oven-safe dish. You can also use a standard pan or cookie sheet, but a dish that keeps the breadsticks together will ensure soft edges. If you want crispier edges, go ahead and place them a couple inches apart on a pan. [2] X Research source At this point, you can also brush the breadsticks with a bit of melted butter and sprinkle them with a pinch of salt for added flavor. If your breadsticks are especially old and have gone a bit stale, you can pass the breadsticks briefly and directly under your faucet to add water. This water will steam in the oven and revive your stale breadsticks. [3] X Research source"
