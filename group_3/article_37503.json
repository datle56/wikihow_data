Different brand strings sound different, so if you like the sound of your current strings, buy the same exact strings. [1] X Research source You should be able to find great mandolin strings at your local musical instrument store or from an online retailer. Choose the strings that will be suit your purposes. Remember that a higher price doesn't always mean the strings will be better. Do not use strings for another instrument on a mandolin. Mandolin strings are made specifically for the instrument and thus other strings will not work the same way."

A mandolin at its simplest has only a few basic parts, the body, the neck (which contains the fretboard), the headstock, and strings. The strings are secured onto the mandolin at the top with tuners on the headstock (or peg head) and at the bottom with a tailpiece , as well as being held up off the body by a bridge, located near the sound holes in the middle of the body.

      "content": "Lay the mandolin on your lap, face up. Have enough room around you so that you can move it around freely. You will also need to have your new strings near by, as well as a pair of wire snippers to clip the ends of the new strings once they are attached. Have these easily accessible."

      "content": "Loosen one of the old strings on your mandolin by rotating the tuner knob on the peg head of the mandolin. Look at the way the old string is wrapped around the post and turn the tuner knob in the direction that will loosen the string. The tuner knob and the post that the string is attached to should rotate in the same direction, so you just need to pay attention to which direction the post needs rotate. [3] X Research source Loosen the string quite a bit. It should be loose enough so that there is no tension on it and it can be easily slipped off the hook it's attached to at the bottom of the mandolin."

It covers the area where the strings are attached to the tailpiece and protects your forearm while playing.

      "content": "Repeat these steps for each of the strings you are replacing. Remember, it's best to remove one string and then immediately replace it, instead of taking them all off at once. Removing a single string, and then immediately replacing it, allows you to keep track of your strings, making sure that you are replacing each string with the same type. Another reason for this is that the bridge and the tailpiece of your mandolin may be held on solely by pressure from the strings and thus may fall off if all the strings are removed. It's simply easier to keep them in place than to put them back in place. [9] X Research source If you take off all the strings and your bridge or tailpiece fall off during string replacement, don't be surprised or worried. You will just need to put them back in place while you attach the new strings."

      "title": "Stretch your new strings just a little bit.",
      "content": "Stretch your new strings just a little bit. Because new strings will stretch out naturally, forcing you to retune repeatedly, you can speed up this process by intentionally stretching new strings out a bit when you put them on. This should be done by over tightening them just a little bit. Be careful not to break them, especially the thin ones they are more delicate. After they are just a bit overtightened, leave them to stretch out for at least 5 hours."
