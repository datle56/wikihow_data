      "title": "Does the tank have water in it?",
      "content": "Does the tank have water in it? If your Shark Steam Mop isn’t steaming, take a look at the water tank. It might seem obvious, but the mop can’t make steam if the tank is empty. How to fix it: If there isn’t any water in the tank, unplug the mop, then carefully add water up to the Fill line. [1] X Research source Do not refill the water tank while the mop is plugged in."

      "title": "Did you wait 30 seconds for the mop to heat up?",
      "content": "Did you wait 30 seconds for the mop to heat up? Each time you plug in your Shark Steam Mop, it needs about 30 seconds to warm up before steam will start coming out. If it’s the first time you’re using the mop—or if you haven’t used it for a long time—it may take even longer than that for steam to build up. [2] X Research source How to fix it: Try waiting longer than 30 seconds to see if the mop starts steaming."

      "title": "Are you using the correct steam setting?",
      "content": "Are you using the correct steam setting? After you plug in your Shark Steam Mop, check whether the Steam Control button is flashing. You’ll see this button on the front of the mop body. If it’s flashing, that means your mop is in Standby mode, so it won’t produce steam. How to fix it: If your steam mop is in Standby mode, press the Steam Control button once to select the “Low Steam” setting or twice to select “High Steam.” [3] X Research source On some models, like the Shark Klik n’ Flip, you may see 3 lights flashing in Standby mode.

      "title": "Did you prime the mop?",
      "content": "Did you prime the mop? The Shark Steam Mop creates steam automatically as the handle moves while you’re mopping. If your mop isn’t making steam, you may need to prime it by pumping the handle several times before you start mopping. As you continue mopping, the back-and-forth motion should continue producing more steam. [5] X Research source How to fix it: Pump the handle up and down about 10 times to prime the mop and release steam. [6] X Research source It’s normal for the steam to be intermittent. If your steam mop has a “High Steam” setting, using this may give you more consistent steam. [7] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Are you holding down the trigger as you mop?",
      "content": "Are you holding down the trigger as you mop? Although the Shark Steam Mop uses the motion of the handle to create steam, you do need to hold down the trigger to release water. You don’t have to hold the button down continuously, but if you’re not seeing steam, you may not be holding it down long enough. [8] X Research source How to fix it: Hold the trigger as you push the mop back and forth until you see steam forming. If water saturates the floor and there’s no steam building up, contact Shark customer service."

      "title": "Is the water tank placed properly?",
      "content": "Is the water tank placed properly? If the tank isn’t lined up correctly, water might not be able to travel through the mop. Visually inspect the tank to see if it’s correctly placed in the body of the mop. Also try to wiggle it—it should be seated firmly, so there shouldn’t be much movement. [9] X Research source How to fix it: Unplug the mop, then remove the water tank. Replace it with the cap facing down, then slide it into place on the mop until you hear a click."

    {
      "title": "Is the water tank cracked or otherwise damaged?",
      "content": "Is the water tank cracked or otherwise damaged? With the mop unit unplugged, remove the water tank and check it carefully—if it’s cracked, water may be leaking out before it can get into the mop. Also, press down on the center of the cap to test whether water is coming out of the tank. [10] X Research source How to fix it: If the tank is damaged or if water isn’t coming out, stop using the mop and contact Shark customer service."

      "title": "Is the nozzle on the bottom of the mop clogged?",
      "content": "Is the nozzle on the bottom of the mop clogged? If everything else on your Shark Steam Mop seems to be working but it still isn’t making steam, the issue could be a clogged nozzle. Calcium and minerals from tap water can build up inside the nozzle, creating a blockage. [11] X Research source How to fix it: Unplug the mop, then insert a Shark nozzle cleaning tool or paperclip into the nozzle on the bottom of the mop head. Wiggle the cleaning tool or paperclip back and forth a few times to dislodge any debris, then try the mop again. If you’ve been using the mop, be sure to let it cool completely so you don’t burn yourself."

      "content": "Call Shark customer service if the steps above didn’t work. If you’ve tried to fix your Shark steam mop yourself but it still isn’t working, stop using the mop and reach out to Shark customer service by calling the number in your owner’s manual. [12] X Research source Don’t try to take the steam mop apart on your own—if it’s not put back together properly, it could be an electrical hazard. [13] X Research source Taking apart your steam mop can also void the warranty. If customer service can’t help you troubleshoot the mop, have it examined by a qualified appliance technician or replace the mop."

If you use tap water in your Shark Steam Mop, calcium and minerals can build up, blocking the jets and eventually damaging the inner mechanisms of the mop. Using distilled or filtered water can help prevent this, prolonging the life of your mop. [14] X Research source Mineral deposits are especially a problem if you live somewhere with hard water.

This can make the mop unsafe to use. [16] X Research source Only use plain water in your Shark Steam Mop. If you want to use a cleaner on your floor, spray it on the floor first, then go over the area with your steam mop."

      "content": "Only use liquid detergent on your mop pads. To prolong the life of your Shark mop pads, machine-wash them in warm water with liquid laundry detergent. Powdered detergent and fabric softener can leave residue that can cause your mop heads to clean less effectively, and harsh cleaners like bleach can damage the fabric. [18] X Research source Because the mop pads wear out over time, Shark recommends replacing them every 3–4 months. If you see loose threads on your Shark mop pads, carefully snip them away with scissors. Don’t pull them or you can unravel the mop head."
