      "content": "No, Shazaam has never been made into a full feature film. Despite many people claiming to remember a 1990s film titled Shazaam starring Sinbad the comedian as a genie, there is no trace of the movie anywhere, leading audiences to believe that this is an example of the Mandela effect . Sinbad himself has dispelled the rumors that Shazaam ever existed, tweeting about it in 2016. He wrote, \"Okay for all you people who think I did a genie movie.. well haven’t done one YET, but I am going to do one so we can close this chapter.\" [1] X Research source"

It starred Shaquille O’Neal as a genie who granted the child protagonist wishes, leading to potentially blurred lines in the public’s memory. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "The Mandela effect is the leading explanation. The Mandela effect, or a phenomenon that causes false memories, may be at the center of this modern mystery. The Mandela effect is when a group of people all share the same false memory. False memories are incorrect recollections of an event. In some extreme cases, like with Shazaam , the event in question never actually happened and is completely fabricated in people's memories. [3] X Research source Distorted and/or fabricated memories like these are scientifically referred to as confabulations. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Sinbad participated in a skit designed to poke fun at the possibility. In 2017, Sinbad took part in a skit for an April Fool’s joke produced by College Humor. In the skit, Sinbad plays a genie alongside two children who find his lamp among their late mother’s belongings. It was only four minutes long, and edited to resemble the grainy VHS tapes of the 1990s. Although only meant to be a joke, the video gave a second life to the rumor that a Shazaam movie really existed. [6] X Research source Confusion surrounding these similar but separate events is thought to be one of the primary reasons behind the shared false memory of Shazaam ."

      "content": "The Mandela effect is a phenomenon where multiple people share the same false memory. Proposed by paranormal researcher, Fiona Broome, in 2009, the theory seeks to explain false memories, which can lead large groups of people to misremember details or even entire events. This idea was born when Broome (along with others) realized she had clear memories of Nelson Mandela dying in prison in the 1990s, along with specific details. In reality, Nelson Mandela was released from prison, went on to be the first president of South Africa in the 1990s, and died in 2013. [7] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source After doing some more digging, Broome was shocked to learn that many other people had similar memories of Mandela dying in prison. There are many incidents of the Mandela effect, including whether the Monopoly Man wears a monocle or not, and if the Fruit of the Loom logo features a cornucopia."

      "title": "Psychology may offer an explanation for the Mandela effect.",
      "content": "Psychology may offer an explanation for the Mandela effect. Some experts believe that certain images may be misremembered if the fabricated details meet the preconceived expectations of the image– even if they’re wrong. For example, it would make sense for the Monopoly Man to wear a monocle since that would fit the status and style of his character. Yet, he doesn’t, leading to this case of false memory and cognitive dissonance. [8] X Research source Scientists can’t offer a general explanation for the Mandela effect, suggesting the phenomenon may only be explained on a case-by-case basis, with each image triggering new patterns. Personal and emotional biases, along with other psychological factors, like suggestibility, may contribute to the Mandela effect."

      "content": "Alternate explanations include parallel realities and the influence of the internet. Although not yet supported by science, some people believe parallel realities or alternate universes are behind the Mandela effect– including Broome. Parallel realities. String theorists suggests that the universe is made up of strings that vibrate across dimensions we can’t see, exchanging information between them. The idea of multiple realities can be used to explain the Mandela effect, as information may be seeping in across dimensions and infiltrating diverging realities. [9] X Research source The influence of the internet. With the spread of information comes the spread of misinformation, resulting in entire communities built on flimsy, fictional foundations. A study released by MIT in 2017 concluded that misinformation was 70% more likely to be retweeted and spread versus true information. [10] X Research source"

If you feel pretty certain of a pop culture event that happened but have no concrete proof– chances are, you’re not alone. New reports of the Mandela effect are constantly popping up, and there’s even an entire Reddit thread where one can plead their Mandela effect case. Here are some of the most well-known instances of the Mandela effect.

What he really said was, “No, I am your father,” in response to a question. “Mirror, mirror on the wall.” This famous fairytale quote is not actually what the evil stepmother says as she admires herself. Instead, she says, “Magic mirror on the wall.” “Meet the Flinstones !” You’ve probably heard of Barney and Wilma, but you may not know that you’ve been writing their names wrong all along. It’s “Flintstones”– not “Flinstones!”"
