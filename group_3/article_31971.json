Crying may also activate your parasympathetic nervous system, which helps your body recover from stress and trauma. [2] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Several studies suggest that crying is a useful coping mechanism because it communicates pain to others. It may also encourage others to show support. [3] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Dr. William Frey’s idea that crying removes toxins from the body is very popular in the media. This may be true, although the amount of toxins eliminated by crying is negligible. Most tears are reabsorbed in your nasal cavity. One study suggested that whether you feel better after crying is linked to how your culture views crying. If your culture (or even your family) views crying as something shameful, you may not feel better after crying. [4] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Don’t make yourself cry if you don’t feel like it. While popular wisdom holds that not crying after a sadness-provoking incident is unhealthy, this is not the case. Crying because you feel obligated to may actually keep you from recovering."
