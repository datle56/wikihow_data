      "content": "Set the board so that the bottom-right square is a light square. Both players will have a light square in the right corner on the edge of the board closest to them. The setup for each player looks identical from their perspective. You set up your pieces on the two horizontal rows (\"ranks\") closest to you. The major pieces go on the first rank. The pawns go on the second rank. Unlike in checkers, chess uses every single square on the board. When setting up your chessboard, a tip to keep in mind is that White is always on rank 1 and 2 and that Black is always on ranks 7 and 8."

Start with your rooks (sometimes called castles), which are tall pieces that move in straight lines horizontally (along \"ranks\") and vertically (along \"files\"). Place a rook on each of your two corners. On a novelty board, such as Civil War sets or movie-themed pieces, it may be impossible to tell what a piece is without knowing the icons (or rule-book symbols) which may be marked on the bottom of the pieces. The symbol for a rook is ♜."

Knights move three squares in an \"L\" shape, first two spaces in one direction, then one space in another, or first one space in one direction, then two in another. Knights can hop over pieces to make their moves, being the only pieces allowed to do so. The symbol for a knight is♞."

By contrast, your opponent's king is merely \"in check\" if you could capture him on your next move but the opponent has a means of escaping. A player must immediately move their king out of check if it's possible to do so. [1] X Research source You never actually capture a king. Once it's apparent that a king cannot avoid being captured on the next move, checkmate is immediately declared, and the game is over. Some players like to say \"check\" when they make a move that puts the opponent's king in immediate danger. You may not place your own king in check. Such a move is considered \"illegal\" and must be immediately rescinded."

      "content": "Capture the opponent's pieces to remove them from the game. If one of your pieces makes a move that ends on a square already occupied by an opponent's piece, you \"capture\" that piece and remove it from the game. Your piece then takes the captured piece's place on that square. You cannot capture your own pieces or occupy any square with more than one piece. In other words, you cannot move a piece through or to a square already occupied by one of your pieces—with the exception of your knights. They may move over any other piece (but may not end a move on a square already occupied by one of your pieces). With the exception of the pawn , you can capture pieces only with a \"normal\" move. For example, rooks can capture only with vertical or horizontal moves. You cannot move over a piece to capture another one. If your piece \"hits\" another piece during its movement, it stops, captures the piece, and stays on that square. The knight is the only exception to this, as it takes a piece only when it ends a move by landing on that piece's square."

Each turn consists of one player moving one piece. [2] X Research source A player must move a piece every turn. They cannot skip a turn simply because they don't know where to move. If a player has no legal moves and is not in check, the game is a stalemate (see below). The only exception to the \"move one piece\" rule is called \"castling,\" which allows a player to move two pieces at once in a specific pattern to protect the king. See below for more on castling.

      "content": "Watch out for stalemate. A game can end in a tie \"draw\". Stalemate occurs when neither king is in check and the next player to move has no legal move available. If you are in an advantageous position, you would want to avoid stalemate. (The opposite is true if you are in a weak position and would love to force a draw.) Stalemate typically may occur when there are only a few pieces left such as pawns blocked by other pawns, and kings that can't move without putting themselves in check. Remember that you can never put yourself in check. Thus, if it's your turn to move and your only available move would put your king in check, the game is over, and a stalemate is declared. [4] X Research source In some tournaments this means you lose, although most players call this a draw. Stalemate does not occur if either king is currently in check."

      "title": "Move pawns one space forward.",
      "content": "Move pawns one space forward. That is usually all they can do, so they're not very useful. However, in certain circumstances, they become quite effective: If your pawn gets all the way to the first rank (for White) or eighth rank (for Black), you can '\"promote\"' the pawn to any piece other than the king or pawn. That means that a pawn that has advanced very far along its file becomes quite powerful. Players typically promote to a queen but may promote to another piece to avoid stalemate or use the knight's move (promoting to a piece other than the queen is called \"underpromotion\"). In its very first move, a pawn may (but does not have to) move two spaces forward instead of one. A pawn can capture a piece that is diagonally one square in front of it. It cannot capture an otherwise adjacent piece. En passant , or \"capture in passing\", can occur when the opponent moves their pawn two spaces ahead to avoid moving into your pawn's capture position (forward-diagonally adjacent). If this happens, only on your very next turn you can move your pawn diagonally into the space they skipped and take that pawn anyway."

The king cannot be in check at the time of castling, nor can the king in castling move through or to a square in which he would be in check. In one turn, move the king two spaces towards the rook, then slide the rook into the square the king skipped over. They will now be on opposite sides and right next to each other."
