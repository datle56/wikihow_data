      "content": "Rizz face is when a guy makes an exaggerated “seductive” face to be funny. The rizz face is all about pretending to be smooth with the ladies in a hilarious, over-the-top way. Guys post videos on social media of themselves making silly faces with piercing eyes, furrowed brows, sucked-in cheeks, and pursed lips. It’s the ultimate “I’m trying to look sexy” face, but it’s done for laughs instead of actually trying to seduce anyone. Rizz face makes fun of how some men might be trying a little too hard to show their rizz. The trend points out that some guys are trying to be effortlessly cool, confident, and charming on social media or in real life, but it’s very obvious they work hard at it."

      "content": "Rizz face videos became popular on TikTok as a joke. Users on TikTok started sharing rizz face videos to make humorous content. They tried to capture a look that expressed their unspoken rizz, but in a funny and self-aware way. The trend caught on with others posting videos where they recreated the funny expression, often with “sexy” background music and dramatic reveals to make it even more over-the-top. In late 2022, users began sharing videos demonstrating “negative rizz,” which is when someone has so little rizz that they repel women. TikTok videos featuring the Rizz “Chin Up” Prank also started showing up in late 2022. In the videos , someone would test their unspoken rizz by approaching someone for a made-up reason. Then, when the other person got close, they would quickly move their hand up to touch the person's chin in a way that is seductive and flirtatious."

      "content": "Some creators use filters or video editing for extra-exaggerated rizz face. Instead of making the rizz face on their own, many on TikTok edit exaggerated brows and cheekbones onto their face in videos to make their rizz face even funnier. Some also edit clips from movies and TV shows. For example, in 2024, YouTuber @Janobot posted multiple Star Wars clips with all or some of the characters edited to have rizz face. Some even use face filters to exaggerate the expression even further."

Then, suck in your cheeks a little and purse your lips. [1] X Research source Act like you’re about to say something over-the-top flirty or cheesy like “Hey girl,” or “How you doin’?” The goal is to look like you're trying really hard to be “effortlessly” charming. Some feel you should raise one eyebrow to give your rizz face an extra level of swagger, like you’re thinking, “I know you’re impressed by my rizz.”"

      "content": "Stare intently and stroke your chin with your finger and thumb. As you’re making the face, lightly stroke your chin as if you’re deep in thought about how fine the lady you’re checking out is. The hand movement adds another layer of cheesy drama, making it seem like you’re trying super hard to impress someone with your charm. Make your stare intense and exaggerated – almost like you’re taking yourself a little too seriously. The chin stroke is the icing on the rizz cake because it emphasizes that you’re totally in the charm zone. The key to giving rizz face is to make the seductive vibe very obvious."

      "content": "Some also suck in or bite their lower lip to kick the rizz up a notch. Add an extra flirty – and hilarious – element by sucking in your lower lip like you’re biting it. The idea is to look like you’re checking someone out from head to toe and really into what you see. The lip bite makes it clear you’re working hard to play up your rizz, but in a way that’s meant to make people laugh. The seductive lip bite is a classic sign of attraction, but when you do it with the rest of the rizz face, it makes it even funnier. [2] X Research source"

These memes feature popular emojis or characters from film and TV with ridiculous rizz edited onto their faces (like this rizz face meme of SpongeBob ). The point of the joke is to show how strange it looks when familiar faces make uncharacteristic \"seductive\" expressions. The images may be paired with humorous captions like \"on my way to steal your girl\" or \"me when I hear my crush is single.\""

While there’s at least one change.org petition for Apple to make an emoji that resembles a rizz face, there is no official rizz face emoji at this time. [3] X Research source The lack of an official emoji hasn’t stopped people from creating their own rizz face emoji-style art. Rizz face stickers have appeared on sites like Redbubble that resemble an emoji. [4] X Research source Use flirty emojis like 😉 (winking face), 😏 (smirking face), or 🫦 (biting lip) to convey the same kind of flirty energy as the rizz face. Try combining emojis to create the feel of rizz face. Use the 🧐 (thinking face) or 🤔 (pondering face) with other flirty emojis like 😘 (Face Blowing a Kiss) or 😚 (blushing kissing face) to emphasize the thoughtful, mysterious part of the rizz face and get across the playful, flirty vibe at the heart of the meme."

For example, someone with W (winner) rizz is more successful with the ladies than someone with L (loser) rizz. [6] X Research source Some people also have verbal rizz, meaning they use rizz lines to charm people. Others have unspoken rizz, which is more about their body language, confidence, and the general vibe they give off. Rizz face is an example of unspoken rizz, since the expression does all the talking."
