      "content": "Start with a square piece of origami paper . Real origami paper always comes in the shape of a colorful square. If all you have is rectangular computer paper, make your own square paper by folding the top corner down diagonally. Trim off the extra rectangle of paper at the bottom. [1] X Research source Choose any color of origami paper. Paper with a multi-colored design works well with this project since the bird's flapping wings will make the colors dance. If your paper has two different colored sides, note which one is facing up and which one is facing down. If your paper is the same color on both sides, make a small mark or design to identify the two sides. the side facing the table is the side that you will see when the bird is complete."

      "content": "Make a diagonal fold. Start by laying the square in front of you so that the bottom corner is pointing at your chest. Bring the top corner down to the bottom corner, then use your finger to make a crease. You will now have a triangular shape with the points facing you. Then unfold the paper so it lays flat again."

      "title": "Make another diagonal fold.",
      "content": "Make another diagonal fold. Rotate the square and fold it again, this time bringing the other corner to meet its opposite. Make a second crease with your finger. The two creases will form an \"X\" shape in your paper. [2] X Research source Unfold your paper again."

      "title": "Fold the square paper in half again.",
      "content": "Fold the square paper in half again. Turn the paper sideways and fold it in half again, then crease the fold with your finger. Unfold your paper once again. You should now have four creases running through your paper that all intersect in the middle of the square."

      "title": "Pinch in the sides to form a smaller square.",
      "content": "Pinch in the sides to form a smaller square. Start with the bottom corner of the square pointing toward your chest. Pinch the two sides of the square along the horizontal fold, bringing the left and right corners down to the bottom corner. The two sides will collapse in toward the middle, and the top corner will fold over them to form a small square. [3] X Research source It might take a little maneuvering to get the sides to collapse toward the middle of the square. It can help to re-crease all of the folds to make them more flexible. If you do this correctly, the small square you make will have a crease running from the top corner to the bottom corner in the center."

[6] X Research source Lay your paper on the table with the colored side facing down and the white side up. If your paper has two different colored sides, note which one is facing up and which one is facing down. If your paper is the same color on both sides, make a small mark or draw a design to identify the two sides. For example, mark the bottom side facing the table. This mark will help you know which side of the paper is currently facing you. The side or color that starts facing the table will be the side or color that you will see when the bird is complete."

Pull back the two flaps that make up the tail to reveal a flat portion of paper below. Pull the flat portion of paper up through your two flaps. Keep the folds you made for the tail intact by folding on the creases, but in the reverse direction. This will allow you to flatten the layers of folds. You will now have a piece of paper that is standing up and looks like a shark fin. The outsides of the fins should be the same color and side that you've marked. The inside is the plain color."
