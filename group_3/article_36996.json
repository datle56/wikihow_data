      "content": "Park the vehicle in a flat area. For safety, move the vehicle to a solid surface, such as a concrete workshop or driveway. Choose a surface that is as even as possible. This is to give the vehicle stability and reduce the risk of an accident. Make sure the vehicle is not leaning to the side. Although rolling is a more frequent issue, an improperly-lifted car can also tip over."

      "title": "Chock 1 of the front tires.",
      "content": "Chock 1 of the front tires. You will need a pair of wheel chocks, which are wedges that fit under tires to prevent your vehicle from rolling. Wedge 1 of the chocks under the front side of the tire. Then, wedge the other chock behind that same tire. [1] X Research source You can purchase chocks, as well as any other parts you need, online or at most auto parts stores."

      "content": "Place jack stands in front of the back tires. You will need 2 jack stands, 1 for each side of the car. Position the stands 1 in (2.5 cm) in front of the back wheels. The car’s frame should rest on top of the stands. [3] X Research source Keep the jack stands the same height."

      "content": "Push the car with your hand to make sure it is stable. Test the vehicle's stability on the jacks before attempting to remove the leaf springs. Gently push against the vehicle, looking for any signs of wobbling. If is is secure, it won’t move at all. If your vehicle seems a little unstable, you may need to lower it onto the jack stands more by lowering the floor jack. If you can’t secure the vehicle, check the jack placement. Make sure they are under the vehicle’s frame."

      "title": "Soak the spring’s nuts and bolts in oil.",
      "content": "Soak the spring’s nuts and bolts in oil. To loosen the parts, spray penetrating oil on them. The oil helps prevent damage to these components as you remove them. You can use a penetrating oil like WD-40. The leaf spring is the long, flat, and slightly curved metal strip. It extends across the length of the tire. To loosen stubborn parts, let the oil soak in overnight. The oil cuts through any rust that may be holding the parts in place."

      "title": "Remove the bolt from the shock pads with a ratchet wrench.",
      "content": "Remove the bolt from the shock pads with a ratchet wrench. Look for a triangular mounting bracket right beside the leaf spring. It will be on the axle and bolted to a bar that attaches to the car’s underside. Use a ratchet wrench to turn the bolts counterclockwise until you can remove the bracket. Set the bolts and other parts aside in a safe spot. You may want to label the parts so you know where to return them later."

Then, slide the bolts off of the axle. [4] X Research source The bolts are horseshoe-shaped, so they are very distinct and noticeable next to the leaf spring. If you have an extra floor jack, placing it under the spring removes some of the tension, making the bolts easier to remove."

      "content": "Unscrew the eyelet bolts on the spring’s ends. At the front end of the wheel, you will see a pair of bolts securing the leaf spring to the vehicle’s underside. Turn these counterclockwise to slide them off of the leaf spring. Repeat this to remove the bolts on the spring’s back end. [5] X Research source The leaf spring will not be supported once you remove these bolts. Support the spring as you slide out the bolts to prevent it from crashing down."

      "content": "Position the new leaf spring under the mounting brackets. Bring the new leaf spring under the vehicle. Set it up so that it looks like a U with the lowest point in the middle. Check to make sure it spans across the tire, reaching the mounting brackets at both ends."

      "title": "Screw the leaf spring to the front bracket with a ratchet wrench.",
      "content": "Screw the leaf spring to the front bracket with a ratchet wrench. Pick up the end near the front of the tire. The leaf spring fits in the lowest point of the bracket, which hangs down from the car’s underside. Slide the eyelet bolt into the bracket and spring, replacing the nut and twisting it clockwise to tighten it. The bolt should be positioned so the head points towards the car’s center. This prevents the bolt from popping out in case it comes loose."

      "content": "Install the U-bolts and shock pad. Hang the U-bolts over the axle, 1 on each side of the spring. Slide the shock pad brackets onto the ends of the bolts. Place the nuts underneath the pads and tighten them to finish securing the parts. You can loosely tighten the nuts for now to make sure the other components are placed correctly. If you do this, remember to tighten the nuts later."

Make sure they are screwed tight enough so that the spring doesn’t wobble when you touch it. If the pieces seem loose or rattle when you drive the vehicle, readjust the bolts as soon as possible."
