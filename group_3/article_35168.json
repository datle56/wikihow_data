      "content": "Ask for three volunteers. This is a good trick to perform in front of a crowd, since you'll need three volunteers to do it correctly. Be sure to get exactly three; the trick won't resonate as well with two, and it simply won't work with four. It's best to choose people you don't know well so the audience won't think you planned the trick together before the show. [1] X Research source"

Give the first third, which will have one straight side and one jagged side, to the first person. Give the second piece, which will have two jagged sides, to the second person. Give the third piece, which will also have one straight side and one jagged side, to the third person. This trick can't be conducted properly unless you rip one piece of paper into thirds, so make sure you prepare for it by having a large sheet of paper on hand. Pay attention to the person who has the piece that is ripped on both sides. This piece of paper is the key to the trick."

Ask the second person (with the double-ripped paper) to write down the name of a person who is dead. Finally, ask the third person to write down the name of a person who is alive. Leave the room while they write. Have the volunteers place their slips of paper in a hat or box. Instruct them not to fold the pieces of paper! It will be more difficult to complete the trick if you can’t easily feel the edges of each slip of paper. Make a show of leaving the room or turning your back while the volunteers write the names on their slips of paper. If you leave the room, have someone come get you when they’re done."

Hold the hat or box above your head, or have someone else hold it, so it's clear that you can't see inside. Look knowingly at the second volunteer while you draw, as though you're reading their mind. Without looking, feel around for the slip of paper that has two rough edges. Draw it out with a flourish and read the name to everyone's amazement."

At the end of the trick, you'll predict which audience member is the luckiest one in the audience, and you'll write your prediction on a chalkboard or slate. The name of the luckiest person will then be drawn from a hat by a volunteer, and it will match your prediction.

Put all the cards in a hat as you finish writing on them. [3] X Research source Make sure no volunteers are too close to you while you're writing down the names, or they'll see what you're up to. If you're doing the trick at a birthday party or an event to honor someone, you could also simply write down the name of the honored person on every card, to ensure that he or she is named the \"luckiest\" person there. Instead of saying you're predicting who is the luckiest person, you could say you're predicting who will get married next, who's the most mysterious person, or who's the unluckiest person.

You should be able to see a corner of the last card in the deck, revealing which card it is. Come to your show with the card box already prepared. Keep the side with the hole away from the audience as you prepare to perform the trick. If you can find a box that has a picture of a playing card printed on it, as many standard decks do, all the better—the hole you make will barely be visible.

This is called cold reading . In other mentalism tricks, the magician may make accurate statements about you despite having never met you—as if they can read your past and personality.
