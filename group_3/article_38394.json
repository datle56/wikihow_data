      "content": "Tighten the hinges on your door. Lift the door by the doorknob. If you can move it upward, then the hinges are likely loose. Use a screwdriver to tighten the screws holding the hinges in place. [2] X Research source Some drafts are caused by the door shifting due to loose hinges. Because of this, before you seal the edges of your door, take a few minutes to tighten all of the hardware. If the hinge screws spin but won't tighten, it means that the wood in the hole is stripped out. You will need to replace the screws with wider or longer screws so that they can dig into wood that is not damaged. You may also need to fill the holes with wood plugs and re-drive the new screws into those plugs if there is a lot of wood damage."

      "title": "Check the state of the old weather stripping.",
      "content": "Check the state of the old weather stripping. If your door had weather stripping previously installed, it might be damaged or deformed. Check it by running your hand around the perimeter of the door while the door is closed. Feel for air coming in between the door and the frame. Mark the areas where you feel air coming in with a light pencil mark or a piece of painterâ€™s tape. If you can feel a draft while checking areas that already have weather stripping, you will need to remove the old weather stripping and replace it with a new seal.

Then use a damp rag to wipe away any visible dirt and debris from the door frame and the edges of the door itself. This will help you attach your new weather stripping securely. [5] X Research source Drag the edge of a paint scraper along the top, bottom, and sides of the door and door frame to remove any stuck-on debris from these surfaces. [6] X Expert Source Jacob Pischer Home Improvement Specialist Expert Interview. 4 September 2020. Also clean the threshold, which is the bottom of the door frame. If there are grooves along the threshold, run a nail through the grooves to scrape away any gunk that has gotten lodged in there. Then run a lightly damp rag along the threshold and door frame to ensure that the surfaces are clean."

      "title": "Buy new weather stripping at a home improvement or hardware store.",
      "content": "Buy new weather stripping at a home improvement or hardware store. There are several different types of weather stripping available, so you'll need to decide which one you wish to use. [7] X Expert Source Jacob Pischer Home Improvement Specialist Expert Interview. 4 September 2020. For the top and sides of your door, wrapped foam weather stripping is durable and works well with gaps of various sizes. Weather stripping with a wooden shell is durable yet easier to work with than metal weather stripping, so it makes a good choice for someone who has no prior experience sealing doors. For the door sweep, consider using a metal door sweep with a flexible vinyl flap for greater durability. [8] X Research source A metal door sweep with a flexible vinyl flap is also fairly easy to install, as the metal piece is screwed down and then the vinyl is inserted into it. More advanced options include storm-proof seals and roller door seals, such as brush or auto-lift vinyl seals that attach to the bottom of roller doors. [9] X Research source If purchasing a weather stripping kit, note that most kits only contain weatherstripping for the top and sides of your door. You will need to purchase a separate door sweep. Rigid door sweeps will not work if the carpet is higher or even with the threshold. When rigid door sweeps won't work, use flexible bulb weather stripping made of vinyl. This attaches to the threshold right under the door. If possible, buy a couple of different thicknesses of weatherstripping and try it out to make sure that the door closes well. When using the wrong size, the door will simply bounce back. [10] X Expert Source Jacob Pischer Home Improvement Specialist Expert Interview. 4 September 2020."

With the door still closed, measure along both sides of the frame with a tape measure. [11] X Research source Note that your measurements for the top and sides of the door will need to be made along the door frame and not the door itself. To achieve a tight seal, you will need to measure cut pieces of weather stripping that are tailor fit to each side, which means that you will need to know the precise length of each side."

Unlike the measurements you took for the top and side seals, you will need to measure for the bottom seal by measuring the bottom of the door itself. [12] X Research source Make sure that you face the inside of the door as you take this measurement. This is the surface that you will be applying weather stripping onto."

Mark the length of the bottom of the door on the door sweep weather stripping that you purchased. [13] X Research source Mark each length using a sharp pencil or marker. Make sure that each line you draw is clear and sharp. When using a weather stripping kit, you will have two long pieces for the sides and one short piece for the top. Make sure to draw your top measurement on the short piece and your side measurements on the long pieces."

You'll also need to make sure that the ends of the top piece are angles and one end of each side piece is angled to fit into the top piece of weather stripping. You do not need to angle the bottom end of your side pieces. [14] X Research source The foam and vinyl portions can be cut using sharp scissors, but you will need a hacksaw or similar tool to cut any metal or wood portions. Hold the metal or wood still with one hand and saw through it with the other. Saw slowly so that you cut it in a straight line ."

Loosely nail it into place. Only hammer the nails in enough to hold the weather stripping in place. [15] X Research source Do not finish driving the nails until you add the side pieces. This seal must be installed along the door frame and not onto the door itself. Use 1-1/2 inch (3.75 cm) nails. Place the nails 2 inches (5 cm) in from either side to prevent splitting. Nails should also be 12 inches (30.5 cm) apart."

As with the top piece, your side pieces will need to fit onto the door frame instead of the actual door and the foam should fill the gap around the door. Place each side piece along the sides of the door frame and tack them into place with a hammer and nails. [16] X Research source If the top angle does not fit into the top piece of weather stripping, file it down. You can use a metal file, sandpaper, or sanding belt to fine-tune these top angles. Make small adjustments and check the fit until you reach the proper angle. As with the top piece of weather stripping, use 1-1/2 inch nails and place them 2 inches (5 cm) from either end. Nails should be spaced 12 inches (30.5 cm) apart from one another."

[19] X Research source Metal door sweeps will already have screw holes in them. Mark the position of these holes onto your door using a pencil or marker. Remove the door sweep temporarily, then drill pilot holes into these marked portions. Note that vinyl door sweeps are installed on the threshold instead of the door, however. Align one end of the strip with one end of the threshold. Using your hands, firmly press the flanges, which are the edges of the strip, into the grooves of the threshold. [20] X Research source"
