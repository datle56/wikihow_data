      "title": "Remove the fairings from the motorcycle and set them in an open space.",
      "content": "Remove the fairings from the motorcycle and set them in an open space. Unscrew all the bolts that are attaching the fairings to the motorcycle body in order to remove them. Place them in an open work space in order to prevent the fumes from the spray paint from being too concentrated when you actually paint the fairings. [1] X Research source After you remove the fairings, be sure to cover the rest of the motorcycle with a tarp in order to protect it from being exposed to the elements while you’re working. If you’re working with brand new fairings that haven’t been attached yet, feel free to skip this step."

      "title": "Clean the fairings with soapy water to remove any dirt from the surface.",
      "content": "Clean the fairings with soapy water to remove any dirt from the surface. Mix ordinary dish soap and hot water in a bucket, then dip a sponge into the water and use it to clean the fairings. Use a circular scrubbing motion for best results. Once you’re done, be sure to rinse all the soapy water off before proceeding to the next step. [2] X Research source If your fairings have been used before, pay particular attention to those parts that have accumulated black engine gunk over time. These areas may require extra attention in order to be completely cleaned."

      "title": "Use 400-grit sandpaper to sand the surface of the fairings.",
      "content": "Use 400-grit sandpaper to sand the surface of the fairings. Sand in a circular motion while applying moderate pressure to the surface. Making the surface of the fairings as smooth as possible will make it much easier for the primer and paint to actually adhere to the surface later on. [3] X Research source You can buy 400-grit sandpaper at any store that sells home improvement supplies."

      "title": "Rinse off the fairings to remove the dust and allow them to dry.",
      "content": "Rinse off the fairings to remove the dust and allow them to dry. Sanding the surface of the fairings will have caused a lot of dust to accumulate on the fairings, which needs to be removed before you can paint them. Wipe down the fairing with water and a microfiber cloth to make sure all of the dust is removed. [4] X Research source The fairings will probably require 1 hour in order to completely dry."
    },
    {
      "title": "Apply a coat of primer to the fairings and allow it to dry.",
      "content": "Apply a coat of primer to the fairings and allow it to dry. Spray the primer so that the surface is covered in a smooth, consistent layer. Spray it in even strokes without stopping in a particular spot in order to avoid leaving patches. Finally, give the primer about 3-6 hours to completely dry. [5] X Research source Be sure to use plastic primer for your fairings. You can buy aerosol primer at any paint supply store."

    {
      "title": "Spray a thin layer of your base color",
      "content": "Spray a thin layer of your base color onto the fairings and let it dry. Cover the entire surface of the fairings with this initial coat, making sure to not leave any spots where the primer is still visible. This thin coat should take about 6 hours to dry. [6] X Research source For maximum safety, wear a breathing mask and safety goggles when applying spray paint to the fairings."

      "title": "Wet sand the fairings after the base color coat has dried.",
      "content": "Wet sand the fairings after the base color coat has dried. Squirt some water onto the surface of the fairings in order to make them wet, then use 1000-grit sandpaper to sand them smooth. Go over the fairings with a microfiber cloth once you’re done to remove any grit and to make sure they’re completely dry before adding more paint to them. [7] X Research source"

      "title": "Apply another coat of the base color, then wait 3 hours for it to dry.",
      "content": "Apply another coat of the base color, then wait 3 hours for it to dry. Be sure to apply the spray paint in even strokes across the surface of the fairings. You can wait longer than 3 hours for the paint to dry if desired, but you need to give it at least 3 hours to ensure that it completely dries. [8] X Research source"

      "title": "Repeat this process 3-4 times to put multiple coats on the fairings.",
      "content": "Repeat this process 3-4 times to put multiple coats on the fairings. This is a technique known as “grip coats,” in which each coat of paint “grips” the coat that has already been applied. This leads to a thicker, richer look to the paint that makes it look very professional. Be sure to wait at least 6 hours after you apply the final coat to allow the paint to dry. [9] X Research source You should ultimately apply 4-5 layers of paint to your fairings to get the best look."

      "title": "Apply 2 coats of lacquer to the fairings once the paint has dried.",
      "content": "Apply 2 coats of lacquer to the fairings once the paint has dried. Spray the first coat of lacquer onto the fairings and use a microfiber cloth to spread it evenly across the surface. Let it dry for about 2 hours, then repeat this process to add a second layer. [10] X Research source Adding clear lacquer will help protect the paint from exposure to the elements. You can buy clear lacquer at any hardware store that sells painting supplies."

      "content": "Leave the fairings to dry for 24 hours, then reattach them to the bike. Use the same bolts that you removed from the fairings at the beginning of this process in order to reattach them to the motorcycle. Once this is done, the bike is ready to ride! [11] X Research source"
