Two jacks can set up a War, or two or more tens can setup a war or even two aces can setup a war. For example, you both flip your cards and each of you flips over a '6'. Now is the time to go to war. To go to war, each player must place three more cards face-down on the table. Flip over a fourth card as you would flip a card when not at 'War'. Whoever has the higher fourth card is the person who takes all 10 cards from the round. If a player doesn't have enough cards to play the war, the player must turn his/her last card face-up. This will be the card used to play the war. [2] X Research source If you're playing with three or four players: If two or more players are tie for the highest card, then each player to place by one card as face-down. Then everybody plays the next card face-up as they would during a non-War round. The player with the highest card will win. If there is another tie between these two or more players, the War needs to continue."

In Război, the number of cards put face-down in a 'war' is determined by the number on the cards that started the 'war'. Example : If both players flip a 6, each player must put five cards face-down during the war and flip a sixth one. All face cards have a value of ten, thus each player must put down nine cards during a war and flip the tenth."
