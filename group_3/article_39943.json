      "title": "The meaning of the red light on your smoke detector varies by model.",
      "content": "The meaning of the red light on your smoke detector varies by model. Each smoke detector has different lights and alert patterns, so it's important to find the manual for your specific model to learn what the red light means on that device. In most cases, a blinking red light without a chirp or sound means the alarm is working properly and there's nothing to worry about. The most common reasons you'll see a red light on your smoke detector: Your smoke detector is receiving power and working properly. The smoke detector has been silenced temporarily. It's time to perform a test. The smoke detector is getting low on battery. The smoke detector is dusty or clogged. Smoke was previously detected."

We've listed the most common red light alert reasons below. For more in-depth information, jump to our sections on Kidde smoke detectors or First Alert smoke detectors . If your detector brand isn't listed, the manual that came with the detector usually lists what each light pattern means. These manuals can also be found online.

If you can't figure out why your smoke detector is blinking red and you want to be sure there isn't an emergency, evacuate the building and call the fire department for help. If you aren't sure if there's an emergency, call the fire department's non-emergency line. Avoid calling 911 if possible unless you're certain there's an emergency."

      "content": "A blink once every 40 to 60 seconds means the detector is working normally. Depending on the model of smoke detector you have, a single flash of the red LED every 40 to 60 seconds means the detector is on standby mode and is functioning correctly. [1] X Research source In some models (such as some Kidde combination smoke/carbon monoxide detectors), the standby light will be green. [2] X Research source In other models, the red LED will flash every 60 seconds for the first 10 minutes after powering on or being reset. Then, it will flash just once every 10 minutes."

      "content": "A rapid blink once per second means the alarm is going off. You should also hear the smoke detector making an alarm. In some models, the red LED will be flashing in the same pattern as the alarm pattern (if your smoke detector has multiple alarm patterns). [3] X Research source In an interconnected alarm system, only the smoke detector that detected the smoke or fire will be flashing red. Other alarms will make a sound but not have a blinking red light."

      "content": "A 1.5-second long flash every 20 seconds is the detector's alarm memory. If you have an interconnected Kidde smoke alarm system, the alarms likely have alarm memory. This means that the alarm that detected the incident will indicate itself with a red flashing light so you know where exactly the smoke or fire was located. To clear the alarm memory, press the Test button until the blinking goes away. It will also automatically clear after 11 to 24 hours (depending on the model of alarm you have). If you have a combination smoke/CO detector, you may see a red light blinking every 15 seconds if the detector had detected smoke, and 2 blinks every 15 seconds if the detector had detected CO.

      "content": "A 1.5-second long flash every 10 seconds indicates Hush mode. Hush mode will temporarily silence your smoke alarm. It's mostly used for nuisance alarms, like when your smoke alarm starts going off because it detected some smoke or steam from cooking. The alarm will stay in Hush mode for 10 minutes. In some models of Kidde combination smoke/CO detectors, Hush mode is instead indicated by a red light blinking every 2 seconds. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Two to 12 flashes in 30 seconds along with chirping indicates fault mode. This means that something with the detector's electronics or sensors is faulty. The light will flash 2 to 12 times in 30 seconds, and the detector will chirp once every 30 seconds. If you notice this happening, contact Kidde's customer service department by calling 1-800-880-6788 for assistance. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "The red light will blink in sync with various alarm patterns. These patterns vary slightly between device models, but in general, this is what each pattern means: A blink and a chirp once every 30 seconds means your device has a low battery . Two blinks and two chirps every 30 seconds means the device has reached its end of life and should be replaced. If the test or Hush button is pressed, the red light will blink along with each alarm pattern. This only occurs if you manually press test/Hush."
