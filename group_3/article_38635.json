      "title": "Find out whether or not it's okay to sell candy at your school.",
      "content": "Find out whether or not it's okay to sell candy at your school. There's no point doing this if the school specifically forbids it. If you're at a sugar-free school or a school focused on healthy eating and no candies, you'll likely get yourself into trouble with the authorities if you haven't told them and get caught. Realize that parents who don't want their children to eat sugar may make trouble in such a case. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Do some market research.",
      "content": "Do some market research. What kind of candy do people at your school want? Does anybody else sell candy? You need to know everything you can to maximize profit. [2] X Research source The most popular candy tends to be candy bars, but it may depend on where you are and what the current fad is."

      "content": "Realize that you won't become rich overnight, and maybe not at all. Realizing this is your first step, because you will most likely be let down. Think small, but by all means, think profit!!!"

      "title": "Save money.",
      "content": "Save money. When you have at least $10 or more, you can go to a nearby bargain store and buy bulk packs that contain over 30 candy bars in each pack. That alone will cost you $10 or so and is a great way to invest in it for starters. [3] X Research source Buy only a little of any new brands of candy you want to try selling. If it is unpopular, you won't waste money and take a loss."

    {
      "title": "Get a box that you can fit in your backpack.",
      "content": "Get a box that you can fit in your backpack. Put the candy inside. A box as wide and long as a shoebox is pretty good, but you may want to aim for one that's a little thinner. It doesn't have to go in your backpack; feel inclined to carry it. Taking between 15 to 20 bars or bags a day of a good variety will help you maximize sales."
    },
    {
      "title": "List all the brands of candy in permanent marker on the lid of the box.",
      "content": "List all the brands of candy in permanent marker on the lid of the box. This will save you from having to search inside the box to tell the customer the actual kinds of candy you have."

    {
      "title": "Go to school one day without your candy.",
      "content": "Go to school one day without your candy. Use the day to advertise. Tell everyone that you will be selling candy and that each bar will be around $1 or so. That way, they will come to school with money and be ready to see what you have."
    },
    {
      "title": "Sell the candy each day thereafter.",
      "content": "Sell the candy each day thereafter. Sell it on the bus, in the cafeteria, even during class, if people really want the candy! (But don't get in trouble.) [4] X Research source Stay on top. Eventually, people will try to sell candy too. You need to make sure they don't. Get better products and deals than theirs, and run them out of business."

    {
      "title": "Take a break from selling, every so often.",
      "content": "Take a break from selling, every so often. You may find that interest declines after a while, and so do your profits. Take a break from selling, then come back with specials. Buy three bars, get one free. Create a bar-a-day club where customers can buy a bar each day, Monday through Thursday, and get a free bar on Free Friday. Expand your employees. Is anybody interested in joining you? If so, hire them. You could hire a supplier (makes candy) and a distributor (sells candy). That way, all you do is sit around and manage the money. Eventually, people could even work for your distributor or supplier. Gain more ground. Try to get distributors in different areas. Do you have friends in another school or neighborhood? If so, you could potentially get more profit off of different people. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Save the money you've made for whatever you want! While it's okay to spend some of your profit right away, it's best to avoid spending all or even most of it immediately. Instead, save the money you make for purchases that are better than what you can get with only a few dollars at a time."
