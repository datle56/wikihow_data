      "content": "Mix some Epsom salts into warm water and soak the wart for 10 minutes. If the wart is on your foot or hand, get a large bowl or bucket and fill it with warm water. Then add a small amount of Epsom salts to the water. The package should tell you the correct amount of salts to add depending on how much water you are using. Soak your hand or foot for roughly 10 minutes. Do this twice a day to see if it helps with your wart at all. It may not, but at least it should be relaxing! [3] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source If you like, you can fill your bathtub with Epsom salt water and soak your entire body. A lot of people find this soothing and relaxing! The water should be warm, but comfortable. You don’t want it to be so hot that it hurts your skin!"

      "content": "Yes, so long as you don’t have an open wound or infection. Most people find Epsom salts to be soothing, and there aren’t any serious risks for most people. However, if you have an open wound, infection, or severe inflammation, talk to a dermatologist before you use Epsom salts. It may be okay, but it’s worth checking first. [4] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Epsom salts are poisonous if they’re ingested, so don’t drink water with Epsom salts in it, and keep the salty water away from your mouth and nose. [5] X Research source Some people believe that drinking Epsom salts are good for constipation, but there’s no evidence it’s actually safe or healthy to do this. [6] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Epsom salts can be a skin irritant for a small number of people.

Daffodils have been recommended by folk healers for a variety of medical conditions throughout history, but there’s just no evidence it will do anything for your wart. While Epsom salts might help, it doesn’t appear that daffodils are going to do anything productive for your skin. In fact, it’s likely to do more harm than good.

      "content": "No, and you’re better off skipping this one for safety reasons. Daffodils are more likely to irritate your skin than cure your wart. These flowers happen to be one of the most common triggers for dermatitis, so you may just cause a skin reaction if you rub daffodils on your wart. [8] X Research source On top of that, the bulbs of daffodils are poisonous if you ingest them. Since there’s no evidence a daffodil-based wart treatment will work anyway, there’s just no reason to try this one. There are a lot of treatments out there that are effective and safe, so you really don’t need to start chopping up daffodils to get rid of your wart."

      "content": "Salicylic acid is probably the most efficient solution. Salicylic acid may sound scary, but it’s a pretty simple and easy treatment. Just buy any wart treatment cream that contains salicylic acid and follow the instructions to apply it to your skin. Typically, you just soak your skin in warm water for 10 minutes or so and then exfoliate the area with an emery board or pumice stone. You put a small dollop of the acid on your wart and then let it be! [9] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Dermatology Professional organization made of over 20,000 certified dermatologists Go to source There are also bandages out there with salicylic acid pre-soaked into the cotton pad if you want to hide the wart while you’re treating it. If you’re looking for natural options, rest assured that salicylic acid is a naturally-occurring compound! [10] X Research source Eventually, the acid will shrink the size of the wart and it the affected skin will peel away on its own."

Just follow the instructions on the box to apply the cooling spray to your skin. Over time, the wart will shrivel up and fall off. [11] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Dermatology Professional organization made of over 20,000 certified dermatologists Go to source These freeze sprays are part of a treatment known as cryotherapy. If you go to see a dermatologist to have the wart professionally removed, this is how they’ll do it. Do not attempt to freeze the wart off with an ice cube! It won’t work, and you’ll just irritate your skin."

Leave it in place for 2-3 days and then peel the tape off of your skin. Clean the area with soap and water, and apply a new bit of tape once you’ve dried the skin.

If you have a small, grainy growth that does not go away after a few days, you likely have a wart. Warts are very common and almost never bring a risk to your health. Warts most commonly appear on the palm of your hands or your fingers.

An effective way to prevent warts is to avoid touching someone with a wart. Warts commonly appear near broken skin, such as a break that results from a hangnail. Avoid biting your nails or picking at your skin to minimize the odds you get a wart.
