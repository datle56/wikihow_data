      "content": "Purchase a razor comb and razors. A razor comb is typically divided into three sections. The end of the comb contains a regular comb. The front of the comb is divided into two different sides: the small-toothed side and the wide-toothed side. The wide-toothed side can be used to create choppy layers. The small-toothed side is great for thinning hair and creating a more subtle look. [1] X Research source If you are a beginner, start out using the small-toothed side first. Once you are comfortable using this side, then try the other side. Visit your local beauty supply store to purchase a razor comb and razors. Razors are usually sold separately. These are usually inexpensive, but higher quality razors will be more expensive."

      "content": "Brush your hair. Use a brush to comb through your hair until it is smooth and all of the tangles are removed. This will help to produce a more even cut. If you are a beginner, it is recommended that you start with dry hair and make sure that your hair is completely straight before you begin, such as by using a flat iron. This way you can see how much hair you are removing and if it is too much or too little. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Divide your hair into three sections.",
      "content": "Divide your hair into three sections. Use clips or ponytail holders to divide your hair into a top, middle and bottom section. The top section should be composed of the hair from the top of your head to the parietal ridge. The middle section should be composed of the hair from your temples to your occipital bone. The bottom section should be composed of the hair at the nape of your neck. [3] X Research source The parietal ridge is the bony halo or ridge along the upper part of your head. The occipital bone is the protrusion at the base of your skull."

Once you are done cutting the middle section, donâ€™t forget to isolate it with a ponytail holder so you can razor cut the top of your hair."
