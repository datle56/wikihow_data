Put the appropriate length guard on the trimmer, then make smooth, steady strokes against the grain—that is, opposite to the direction of hair growth. Use your free hand to pull your skin taut if you have loose skin in the area you’re trimming. [2] X Expert Source Juan Sabino Professional Barber Expert Interview. 28 January 2020. Don’t try to trim the hair right down to the skin with the trimmer—you’ll just cause skin irritation and potentially nick your skin. It’s easier to clean up dry hair than wet hair, so, from a cleanup perspective, it makes sense to use a dry trimmer first before shaving with water."

Untie the towel from behind your neck and fold it in from the corners to keep all the fallen hairs where they belong. Set the towel aside for now so you can shake it out later. Grab a hand vacuum or put the small attachment on your vacuum cleaner, then use it to suck up any hairs in the sink area that managed to avoid your towel bib. [3] X Research source You can use a brush and dustpan if you like, but it’s easier to get rid of the hair with a vacuum. When you’re all done shaving, take the towel outside, unfold it, and shake out the hair. If it’s windy outside, make sure the wind is at your back!"

Dampen the paper towels lightly, then use the moisture to stick the towels to the countertop and down into the basin. Overlap the sheets slightly so you get full coverage. Alternatively, use a designated “shaving towel” instead of paper towels. When damp, both paper and cloth towels stay in place and hold onto fallen hairs better. Some people use this “damp towel” method for trimming as well as shaving, instead of using a dry towel for trimming and a damp towel for shaving. It’s really a matter of personal preference, although many people find cleaning up dry trimmings easier. [4] X Research source"

Designate a “clean bowl” for wetting your face before and after shaving, and a “hair bowl” for cleaning off the razor between shaving strokes. By using water bowls instead of filling the skin basin, you’re reducing the likelihood of wet, sticky hairs and clogged drains.

Since you used a towel or sheet to capture all the hair from trimming, the tub or shower drain should be able to handle what remains without getting clogged. In the long run, the less tiny hairs from trimming and shaving you rinse down the drain, the better! If your drain does start clogging , pour 1 cup or 8 oz (230 g) of baking soda into the drain. Combine 8 fl oz (240 ml) of hot water (boiling if possible) and 8 fl oz (240 ml) of white vinegar, then slowly pour it down the drain. Wait 30-60 minutes, then pour more hot or boiling water down the drain.

While it’s nice not to get hair everywhere while shaving your pubic hair, worry more about doing the job “down there” carefully! Whether you’re shaving in the area of your penis [17] X Research source or vagina, [18] X Research source keep the following tips in mind for the best results: Carefully trim any pubic hair that’s more than about 1 ⁄ 8 in (3.2 mm) in length. Soak the area in warm water (or shower) for about 5 minutes before shaving. Use a fresh, sharp razor with a moisturizing strip—never use a dull razor! Pull loose skin taut with your free hand. Shave only with the grain, not against the direction of hair growth. Rinse the blade often with clean water.
