[1] X Expert Source David Jia Academic Tutor Expert Interview. 23 February 2021. List out the multiples of each denominator in the problem until you find a number that all the fractions have in common. [2] X Research source Let’s say you’re comparing three fractions: 5 / 8 {\\displaystyle 5/8} , 2 / 3 {\\displaystyle 2/3} , and 3 / 4 {\\displaystyle 3/4} . You’d list of several multiples of 8 (8, 16, 24), 3 (3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24), and 4 (4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24). In this example, 24 would be the least common denominator. Alternative: Multiply all the denominators together to get the LCM. For example, if you’re comparing 2 / 3 {\\displaystyle 2/3} , 5 / 6 {\\displaystyle 5/6} , and 1 / 3 {\\displaystyle 1/3} , you’d multiply 6 and 3 to get 18 as the LCM (you’d only need to multiply by 3 once)."

      "content": "Convert any mixed numbers to improper fractions. Mixed numbers are a combination of whole numbers and fractions, like 32 / 3 {\\displaystyle 32/3} . To order them properly with other fractions, you need to convert them to an improper fraction (a fraction with a higher numerator than denominator): Separate the whole number from the fraction. In our example, that would be 3 and 2/3. Multiply the whole number by the denominator of the fraction. In our example, you’d multiply 3 / 1 {\\displaystyle 3/1} by 3 / 3 {\\displaystyle 3/3} , giving you 9 / 3 {\\displaystyle 9/3} . Add the numerators of the improper fraction and leftover fraction together. In our example, 9 / 3 + 2 / 3 {\\displaystyle 9/3+2/3} would become 11 / 3 {\\displaystyle 11/3} ."

Now that you know the LCM, multiply the numerator and denominator by the same number—whichever number turns the denominator into the LCM. In our example, for instance, 5 / 8 {\\displaystyle 5/8} would be multiplied by 3 / 3 {\\displaystyle 3/3} to make 15 / 24 {\\displaystyle 15/24} , with 24 being the LCM. [3] X Research source To continue with the previous example, we’d multiply 2 / 3 {\\displaystyle 2/3} by 8 / 8 {\\displaystyle 8/8} to get 16 / 24 {\\displaystyle 16/24} and 3 / 4 {\\displaystyle 3/4} by 6 / 6 {\\displaystyle 6/6} to get 18 / 24 {\\displaystyle 18/24} ."

Now that we’ve successfully ordered the fractions, we can convert 15 / 24 {\\displaystyle 15/24} by dividing both the numerator and denominator by 3, which gives us 5 / 8 {\\displaystyle 5/8} again."

      "content": "Order the fractions from the largest denominator to the smallest denominator. The denominator (bottom number) describes how many pieces a whole is broken into. The larger the number, the more pieces there are—and, more importantly, the smaller those pieces are. To order fractions with identical numerators (top numbers) but different denominators from least to greatest, work your way from the fractions with the largest denominators to the fractions with the smallest denominators. [5] X Research source Picture two circles, with one divided into 10 pieces and the other divided into 5 pieces. A 1 / 10 {\\displaystyle 1/10} slice would be smaller than a 1 / 5 {\\displaystyle 1/5} slice."

When the denominators (bottom numbers) are identical, all you have to do is organize the numerators (top numbers) in numerical order. So, the fraction with the smallest numerator would go on one end, while the fraction with the largest numerator would go on the opposite side. [6] X Research source Imagine you have two fractions: 2 / 8 {\\displaystyle 2/8} and 5 / 8 {\\displaystyle 5/8} . The 2 / 8 {\\displaystyle 2/8} fraction would be considered smaller, since it incorporates fewer total pieces of the pie."
