      "title": "Sanitize your pruners before starting.",
      "content": "Sanitize your pruners before starting. When you prune a plant, the parts you cut are vulnerable to infection. Clean your pruners or loppers by wiping them down with soap and water or isopropyl alcohol. Scrub away any dirt, sap, and other debris. [1] X Research source Buy hand pruners or loppers at most hardware or home improvement stores. If you have to cut any diseased branches, give your pruners another wipe down between cuts so you don’t accidentally damage other healthy branches."

      "title": "Cut off all the old flower heads, if desired.",
      "content": "Cut off all the old flower heads, if desired. This process is called deadheading. Your hydrangea will still have its old flowers on it from the previous year’s bloom. These flowers are dead, as you’ll probably be able to tell by their color and dried out feel. While it isn’t necessary to remove them, deadheading keeps the plant looking tidy while you wait for new blooms. [2] X Research source Some people like the look that the old blooms bring to their garden in winter. If you do, it’s perfectly fine to leave them on."

      "title": "Clip branches above nodes at a 45-degree angle.",
      "content": "Clip branches above nodes at a 45-degree angle. Look for the nodes on the branches of your hydrangea. These will look like two small bumps next to each other. The nodes are what create new growth. Clip right above them so that they stay on your plant and make it easier for it to create new branches. Always clip at an angle so that water doesn’t pool on top of where you cut. [3] X Research source If the nodes are hard to see, use your fingers to feel for two pin-head sized bumps that are side by side."

      "title": "Remove dead, dying, and diseased branches.",
      "content": "Remove dead, dying, and diseased branches. It’s important to check your limelight hydrangea for dead/dying, diseased, and damaged branches to keep it healthy and looking its best. Dead or dying branches will be more gray than other branches, and they’re typically lighter and less dense. Diseased branches may have cankers on the stems and brown or yellow spots on leaves and blooms. Cut these branches off to preserve your plant’s health. [4] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Cut off crossing branches.",
      "content": "Cut off crossing branches. Branches that cross over each other or rub closely together not only give your hydrangea a tangled, messy appearance, but they can sometimes merge together or damage each other when they rub together. Cut the branch that is crooked back to the base of the plant so that it’s more likely to grow straight when new growth appears. [5] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Cut back any branches with holes.",
      "content": "Cut back any branches with holes. As you’re pruning, you may notice some branches have holes in the center. This often means there’s an insect inside, which can damage the plant if left alone. Snip these branches back to the next healthy node and examine it. If it’s still hollow, keep clipping it back until the wood is solid all the way through. [6] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Remove smaller branches to grow bigger flowers.",
      "content": "Remove smaller branches to grow bigger flowers. Your limelight hydrangea will grow bigger blooms if you cut away small, twig-like branches from its base, as this allows the plant to send all of its energy into the larger branches when it’s time to bloom . It isn’t necessary to remove small branches for the plant’s health, however. If you leave them on, your hydrangea will grow more flowers, but they will be smaller. Try leaving the small branches in your hydrangea for a season and see how the flowers look. If they are too small, cut them out the following winter."

    {
      "title": "Remove 1/3 of the hydrangea’s growth to keep it healthy.",
      "content": "Remove 1/3 of the hydrangea’s growth to keep it healthy. If your limelight hydrangea has grown too tall for your liking, clip all the branches down, cutting off no more than 1/3 of the plant’s total growth. This will leave a strong base of old wood to support new growth in the spring. Limelight hydrangeas in particular are great at coming back from huge chops, and your plant will have no problem recovering from being cut down like this. [7] X Research source When pruning in general, it’s usually best not to remove more than 1/3 of the plant’s growth at one time. This helps ensure the plant stays healthy. Don’t cut your hydrangea shorter than 18 inches (46 cm) above the ground. Any shorter, and it might be too hard for your plant to grow back. If necessary, use a tape measure to determine where to cut the branches."

    {
      "title": "Cut off long branches to make the plant look uniform.",
      "content": "Cut off long branches to make the plant look uniform. Branches that are particularly long or stick out awkwardly can make the hydrangea look messy. Examine the plant from all sides to determine which branches you want to cut, then simply prune them back so they are even with the rest of the branches. [8] X Research source Pruning like this is entirely up to your stylistic discretion. Shape your hydrangea however you’d like. Just remember that it will grow leaves and new flowers in the spring."

      "title": "Prune in late winter/early spring when the plant is dormant.",
      "content": "Prune in late winter/early spring when the plant is dormant. Limelight hydrangeas are hearty plants so it’s possible to prune them at any time of the year. However, it’s easiest to prune them in late winter or early spring because the leaves will have fallen off and it will be easier to see and access the branches. New growth won’t grow until later in spring, so you don’t have to worry about accidentally cutting off new blooms. [9] X Research source"

      "title": "Cut your hydrangea when it is getting too big for your space.",
      "content": "Cut your hydrangea when it is getting too big for your space. Limelight hydrangeas can grow up to 6 feet (1.8 m) tall, so if you have a relatively small space, it may be necessary to cut them back if they outgrow it. Trimming at least 1/3 of the height off the top is a great way to keep them from growing too tall. [10] X Research source Hydrangeas are hearty plants, so cutting them back won’t hurt them. In fact, it helps them grow bigger and faster."

      "title": "Trim your hydrangea if the flowers make the branches droop.",
      "content": "Trim your hydrangea if the flowers make the branches droop. Sometimes, limelight hydrangeas will produce so many flowers that their branches can’t hold all of the weight. If your plant’s branches are sagging or the overall shape of the hydrangea is droopy, thin out some of the branches. [11] X Research source Hydrangea flowers are usually fairly large, and they can hold on to a lot of water during the rainy season. This makes them especially heavy."

      "content": "Grow them in well-draining soil. Hydrangeas generally prefer a rich, well-draining soil; it doesn’t matter what kind, as long as the soil doesn’t stay wet for long. Unlike other types of hydrangeas, the pH of the soil doesn’t affect limelight hydrangeas’ bloom color. [15] X Research source"

      "content": "Fertilize limelight hydrangeas once in early spring. Typically, limelight hydrangeas do well with light fertilization. Apply a granular flower food fertilizer according to package instructions in early spring. In many cases, the plant will not need another dose until the following spring. However, if the hydrangea needs it, apply another dose in late summer. [17] X Research source"

      "content": "Can you prune limelight hydrangeas in the fall? It’s technically possible, but it isn’t recommended. If you live in a very cold climate with strong frosts in the winter, it’s best to wait until spring, as the frost could get into the hydrangea’s pruning wounds and damage it. Cutting too early in the fall could also cause the plant to grow new shoots before going dormant, which could be damaged by the cold weather. [18] X Research source If you’re only removing dead or damaged wood, this can be done at any time of the year."

It’s better to prune in late winter or early spring when the plant is dormant so you can see which branches need to be removed. If you prune in summer, you risk cutting off new growth. It is okay to remove dead or damaged wood at any time of year, however. [19] X Research source"

      "content": "Should you deadhead a limelight hydrangea? It isn’t necessary to deadhead, or remove old blooms, from limelight hydrangeas. This is ultimately a personal preference, as some choose to remove them to make the plant look more uniform when dormant. Others enjoy the look of the old blooms in their winter garden. Choose whatever looks best to you. [20] X Research source"

      "content": "Can I prune all types of hydrangeas the same way? No, not all hydrangeas grow the same way, so pruning them all the same way could cause you to lose a whole year’s worth of blooms. Limelight hydrangeas bloom from new growth, while some hydrangeas bloom from old growth, so clipping the wrong branches could be damaging. Research each type of hydrangea to determine the best way to prune it . [21] X Research source For example, it’s better to prune lacecap hydrangeas in June or July because it blooms on old growth."
