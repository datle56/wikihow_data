      "content": "Saturate the wig with conditioner while it's still wet. If you didn't do a bleach bath, or if the wig has dried since you did it, wet it thoroughly in the sink. Work at least 2 ounces (57 g) of conditioner into the wig and leave it in."

      "title": "Place the wig inside a plastic bag and microwave it for 30 seconds.",
      "content": "Place the wig inside a plastic bag and microwave it for 30 seconds. This will heat the wet hair slightly and create some steam inside the bag, which will help to moisturize it. Use a zippable bag that's large enough for you to fit the wig inside it and seal it tightly. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Let the wig sit in the bag for at least 1 hour.",
      "content": "Let the wig sit in the bag for at least 1 hour. The bag may be hot, so be careful when handling it until it has cooled down. Letting it sit in the bag will give it time to absorb the water, steam and conditioner. You can also place a hot steamed towel over the bag to help retain some of the heat while it sits."

      "title": "Add 2 ounces (57 g) of Clorox bleach to the first bowl.",
      "content": "Add 2 ounces (57 g) of Clorox bleach to the first bowl. The bleach will open up the hair's cuticles and make it easier to detangle. It will also remove oils and dirt that have collected in the hair. [3] X Research source Bleach can irritate skin, so you may want to wear rubber gloves as an extra precaution."

      "content": "Rinse the wig thoroughly with hot water in the sink. Hold the wig so that the bottom of the cap, or the part that will touch your head, is facing up. This will keep the hair falling downwards and prevent it from tangling while you rinse it."

      "content": "Shampoo and condition your wig regularly when it's in use. If you wear your wig frequently, you should care for it like you would your own hair.
