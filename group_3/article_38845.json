You can, in fact, adjust the number of decimal places displayed for calculations you are currently working on. [2] X Research source For example, if the display currently reads |3.00| and you change the number of decimal places to 4, the display will read |3.0000| once you exit from the decimal-changing process. No matter what you set the calculator to display, it always internally calculates numbers to 13 decimal places. In other words, the calculator may display |3.00|, but it treats the number as 3.0000000000000."

Hitting the [2nd] button activates the upper labels (the “second functions”) for just the next button push. [3] X Research source For example, the [5] button has a “%” label above it. If you want to activate the “%” second function (that is, turn the [5] button into the [%] button), press the [2nd] button immediately beforehand. [4] X Research source"

The “DEC” stands for decimals, and the “2.00” shows that the calculator is currently set to display 2 decimal places (the default for the device). [6] X Research source If the decimal place setting has already been changed before, the screen will display the current setting.

While it’s unlikely you’ll want zero decimal places on a financial calculator, you can set it for that by pressing the [0] button.

Once you complete the process of changing the number of decimal places, this option will show as few decimal places as are necessary in order to completely display the number, yet no more than 9 decimal places. In other words, say your enter the number 3.5: [8] X Research source In the default 2-decimal format, the display will read |3.50|. If set to zero decimal places, it will read |4.|. If set to 3 decimal places, it will read |3.500|. If set to 8 decimal places, it will read |3.50000000|. If set to the “floating decimal” format (by pressing [9]), it will read |3.5|."
