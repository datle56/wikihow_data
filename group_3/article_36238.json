The \"Remove this follower\" feature is only available when you visit X in a web browser on your computer, phone or tablet—it's not available in the X mobile app. When you remove a follower, that person can still follow you again in the future if you haven't made your X account private . If you don't want this person to contact you at all on X, block them instead. Removing a follower will not send a notification to that person, but they may notice that they are no longer following you if they stop seeing your tweets in their timeline. If you want to use the X mobile app, you can soft-block the follower instead."
