      "content": "Pick out a wax polish to add a beautiful shine to your shoes. Wax shoe polishes are a good choice if you want the traditional shine covering your shoes. They do a good job of protecting the leather while also helping to cover any scuffs you might have on your shoes. [1] X Research source Wax polish is safe to use on faux leather as well."

      "title": "Opt for a cream polish to add needed moisture back into your shoes.",
      "content": "Opt for a cream polish to add needed moisture back into your shoes. Cream polishes won’t give you the same shine as a wax polish, but they’re great for moisturizing the leather. If you’re more worried about your brown shoes’ durability and are fine with a simple shine, a cream polish is a good option. [2] X Research source Both wax and cream polishes come in many different shades."

    {
      "title": "Use a neutral polish to make your shoes shine without adding color.",
      "content": "Use a neutral polish to make your shoes shine without adding color. Brown shoes can be tricky to match to a specific color of polish, making a neutral polish a popular choice. A neutral polish is untinted, comes in both wax and cream forms, and will shine your shoes beautifully while letting the natural color peek through. [3] X Research source If you’re worried about picking the wrong polish color for your brown shoes, choose a neutral one."

      "title": "Match your shoes to a brown shoe polish to add a tint of color.",
      "content": "Match your shoes to a brown shoe polish to add a tint of color. Shoe polish comes in many different shades, so it’s likely that there’s a polish just right for your specific shade of brown shoe. Bring your shoe into the store to match it to a shade of polish, if possible, to ensure the match is as perfect as possible. [4] X Research source If you’re between two colors and aren’t sure which one matches the best, opt for the darker shade."

      "title": "Alternate between neutral and colored polish to maintain your shoe’s color.",
      "content": "Alternate between neutral and colored polish to maintain your shoe’s color. If you polish your shoes using a neutral polish, it’s a good idea to use a colored polish the next time you polish your shoes to help ensure the color doesn’t fade. This isn’t required, but it’s a good way to maintain the brown color of your shoes. [5] X Research source Likewise, if you use a brown shoe polish one time, consider using a neutral polish the next time."

      "title": "Take out your shoe’s laces.",
      "content": "Take out your shoe’s laces. This isn’t required, but it will help keep your laces from getting polish on them and ensure your shoes are evenly covered. Carefully unlace each shoe, setting the shoe laces to the side so they don’t get dirty. [6] X Research source Now is a good time to put down newspaper or a piece of plastic on your work surface if you’re worried about getting polish or cleaner on it."

      "title": "Stuff your shoe with paper or a shoe tree to provide a stable surface to work on.",
      "content": "Stuff your shoe with paper or a shoe tree to provide a stable surface to work on. Scrunch newspaper into balls and stuff them in your shoes, or insert a shoe tree into your shoe if you have one. This stretches the leather out so you have a flat, even surface to polish your shoes. [7] X Research source Look for a shoe tree at your local shoe store, big box store, or online."

      "content": "Wipe away any dust or debris using a clean, dry microfiber towel. This removes any dust or large dirt specks that would get in the way of the polish. Be thorough and make sure you’ve wiped down the tops and each side of your shoes. [8] X Research source Wiping the bottom of your shoes isn’t necessary since this part won’t be polished."

      "content": "Use leather cleaner to remove peskier pieces of dirt. Use a dime-sized amount of cleaner on a microfiber towel before rubbing the cleaner into the leather using circular motions. Use gentle movements and make sure you clean the entire shoe, spending extra time on spots that look dirty. [9] X Research source Look for a leather cleaner at your local big box store or online."

      "content": "Wipe your shoes with a clean rag to remove the cleaner. Use a dry microfiber rag to give them one final wipe down. Make sure all of the cleaner is removed and that your shoes are dry. [10] X Research source Inspect each shoe for any lingering dirt specks and wipe them off with the rag if needed. If you leave dirt specks on your shoes before polishing them, they may cause scratches as you rub the polish into the shoe."

      "content": "Dip a microfiber rag into your chosen shoe polish. Use a cloth made specifically for shoes, or find an old clean T-shirt to use instead. Wrap the rag around your fingers and dip it into the polish, covering the tip of the rag with the polish. [11] X Research source Start off with a small amount if you’re not sure how much to apply to the rag—you can always dip your rag in again to add more."

      "content": "Apply the polish to your shoes using a rag and let each shoe sit for 5 minutes. Holding your shoe in one hand, gently rub the polish into the shoe with the other hand using circular motions. Go slowly and cover each section of the shoe with the same amount of polish to ensure you get an even shine. [12] X Research source Once you’ve applied the polish to one shoe, set that shoe aside and begin working on the next to let the polish soak in for at least five minutes. Scoop out enough polish onto the rag to cover the tip of the rag entirely. The entire shoe should have a nice fine layer of polish on it."

      "content": "Use a horsehair brush and quick motions to buff the surface of the shoes. Take a horsehair brush and start brushing the shoe using quick back-and-forth motions. Keep buffing all sides of the shoe, brushing them with the horsehair brush evenly. This final buff creates a shiny surface. [13] X Research source If you polish shoes in other colors, use a separate buffing brush for brown shoes. This ensures you don’t brush other colors of polish onto your shoes by accident. If there's excess polish on your shoes after buffing them, gently wipe the polish off with a clean rag."

      "content": "Re-lace the shoes once they're dry. After the polish on your shoes has dried, begin weaving the laces back into place just as they were when you removed them. Start from the end closest to your toes when re-lacing them, ending up near your ankles. Touch the surface of the shoe to see if it's still wet. Waiting a few hours before re-lacing your shoes will likely be enough time for them to dry."
