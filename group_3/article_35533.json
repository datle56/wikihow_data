      "content": "Be prepared to stay in the hospital overnight. Most of the time, transmasculine top surgery (meaning the removal of breasts to create a masculine chest) is an outpatient surgery, meaning that you will go home or to wherever you will recover locally after the procedure. Sometimes, you might need to spend at least 1 night in the hospital so you can rest and your medical team can make sure you’re recovering well. [1] X Trustworthy Source Johns Hopkins Medicine Official resource database of the world-leading Johns Hopkins Hospital Go to source Ask your surgeon how long they expect your hospital stay to be. If they think you’ll be there for 1 or more nights, pack a hospital bag with supplies such as your toothbrush and hairbrush, slippers, comfortable clothing, your phone charger, and something to keep you entertained. Although it varies according to the specific procedure and incision type, your surgery will probably last somewhere between 1-4 hours. Transmasculine top surgery involves removing the glandular tissue and fat from inside your breasts to make them smaller. If your breasts are large, your surgeon might also need to remove and resize your nipples and areolas and then graft them back on. [2] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source This procedure is performed under full general anesthesia, so you won’t feel anything during the surgery itself. You may feel tired and disoriented for a bit after you wake up."

      "content": "Expect some pain, swelling, and bruising in your chest. It’s normal to feel some pain, tenderness, or tightness in your chest after a chest reconstruction surgery, especially in the first 1-2 days after the procedure. You might also have some swelling and bruising, particularly during the first few weeks after the operation and you'll likely feel fatigued. If you have any concerns about what you’re seeing or feeling, don’t hesitate to call your surgeon. [3] X Research source Use ice packs to reduce pain and swelling after your surgery. In addition, get plenty of rest, and pamper yourself following your procedure. You might continue to feel some discomfort or pain for up to 6 months after the surgery. Some people also experience numbness in their nipples or the skin of their chest. Your surgeon will prescribe medications to help manage your pain. Reach out to them right away if your pain is severe or isn’t responding to medications. However, you should be able to switch to an over-the-counter reliever within 5-7 days after the procedure, and you might not need anything within 10 days of the surgery."

      "content": "Care for your bandages and drains as recommended by your surgeon. After your surgery, you’ll need to wear an elastic compression bandage over gauze dressings for 1-2 weeks after the surgery. You’ll also most likely have a drainage tube implanted on each side of your chest to drain off excess fluids. [4] X Research source Ask your surgeon how to care for your dressings and the drains to prevent infections and keep the surgery site clean. For example, you may need to empty the drains occasionally and record the amount of fluid that accumulates. [5] X Research source Keep your bandages as clean and dry as possible, and don’t remove them unless your surgeon instructs you to do so. You may need to avoid bathing until your surgeon removes the bandages and drains. To keep yourself clean, use personal wipes or a damp washcloth to wipe down the rest of your body. You can also wash your hair with dry shampoo ."

Use pillows to prop up your upper body, or sleep in a recliner with your torso elevated. [6] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Your surgeon may ask you to sleep on your back to avoid putting pressure on the surgery site. Ask them when you can safely return to sleeping on your side or stomach, if that’s more comfortable for you."

      "content": "Take any medications as prescribed by your surgeon. Your surgeon or doctor may prescribe medications to reduce inflammation, manage your pain, and prevent infections. If you had a nipple graft, you’ll probably need to apply antibiotic ointment to the grafts twice a day for 2-3 weeks after the surgery. Follow your doctor’s instructions for taking these medications carefully, and don’t hesitate to ask any questions you have about how to use them. [7] X Research source Tell your surgeon about any other medications, vitamins, or supplements you’re taking before your surgery. They may ask you to stop taking certain medications or supplements to avoid complications or medication interactions."

It’s unlikely you’ll have any major complications after your surgery, especially if you take it easy and follow your doctor’s instructions. However, problems can still occasionally come up, even if you’re taking good care of yourself. Contact your doctor right away if you notice any worrisome symptoms, such as: [8] X Research source Severe or worsening swelling, pain, bleeding, or bruising around the surgical site Bumps or bulges under the skin on your chest An asymmetrical appearance to your chest Redness, itching, a bad smell, or unusual discharge around the surgery site A fever, chills, or a general feeling of being unwell"

Lifting heavy weights after your top surgery can cause damage to the incision sites and make inflammation worse. Avoid heavy pushing, intense physical activity, and lifting anything heavier than 10–15 pounds (4.5–6.8 kg) until your surgeon says it’s safe. [9] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source You may need to wait 3 or 4 weeks before you can do any strenuous activity.

      "content": "Avoid cigarettes or other nicotine products for at least 6 weeks after surgery. Smoking can delay your healing and make scarring worse. [11] X Research source If you smoke, you should quit at least 2 weeks before your surgery and stay away from cigarettes for at least another 6 weeks after the surgery to achieve the best possible recovery. If you’re not sure how to quit, talk to your doctor. They can give you advice or even prescribe medications to help you quit."

      "title": "Ask when you can return to your regular activities.",
      "content": "Ask when you can return to your regular activities. Resting is a crucial part of recovery after any surgery, so don’t try to jump back into your regular routine right away. Ask your surgeon when you can expect to return to activities like work, school, socializing, and getting exercise. [12] X Research source Typically, you'll be able to resume light physical activity and sedentary work within 7-9 days after surgery, and in fact, doing so can even help the healing process. However, depending on the work you do, you should plan to take 1 1/2—2 weeks off of work, and you should avoid any physical activities that might make you sweat or increase your heart rate for about 3 weeks. After that, light cardio can be resumed, but weight training isn't recommended for at least a month. Most people can resume normal daily activities and exercise 6 months after surgery. For several types of FTM/N top surgery, you'll be advised not to lift your elbows as high as or above your shoulders for 6 months following the procedure, because that can lead to thickening and widening of the surgical scars."

      "content": "Schedule follow-up appointments to check your progress. Your surgeon will want to see you a few times after the procedure to make sure you’re healing up well. Make sure you attend all of those appointments so that you can catch any issues and deal with them promptly. Let your surgeon know if you have any questions or concerns during your follow-up appointments. Individual surgeons' follow-up plans vary, but you’ll likely need to see your surgeon somewhere around 1, 2, and 6 weeks after the operation. Don’t hesitate to reach out to them or your regular doctor if you have any questions or concerns between scheduled appointments."

      "content": "Talk to your surgeon about revision surgery if necessary. In rare cases, it might be necessary to have surgery a second time to correct any issues, such as excessive scarring, problems with your nipple graft, or an asymmetrical appearance to your chest. If you have any concerns about how your chest looks or how the surgery is healing, talk to your surgeon right away. However, also keep in mind that there are many changes in shape and swelling in the months that follow surgery, so your surgeon might not be able to assess whether a revision is necessary until 6 months after the original procedure. [13] X Research source Some scarring is inevitable with top surgery, but you can minimize your scars by taking good care of the surgery site, avoiding smoking, and protecting the area from the sun for the first year after the surgery.

[15] X Research source You will be under general anesthesia, so you’ll likely be tired and groggy after the procedure is finished. If possible, have someone at the hospital with you who can drive you home and stay with you for the rest of the day. In breast augmentation surgery, your surgeon will insert an implant either under the skin of each breast or behind the pectoral muscle. Typically, the incisions are closed with either sutures that you cannot see, and sometimes also with surgical glue.

It’s normal for your bruising and swelling to get worse over the first 2-3 days after surgery before it starts to get better. As the incisions continue to heal, it’s normal to feel some itching and to experience an occasional shooting pain. However, don’t hesitate to reach out to your doctor or surgeon if you’re in a lot of pain or have any concerns about what you’re feeling."

[23] X Research source Putting too much stress on your upper body early in the healing process can aggravate the surgical wounds or even displace the implants. [24] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source It is a good idea to walk around a little bit during the first few days after the surgery if you can, since this will help promote healthy circulation in your legs.
