      "content": "Skibidi slicers are Gen Alpha slang for food. The term comes from a video by Grant Wiseman. In the video, a fake restaurant tries to relate to kids by using terms like “rizz,” “mewing,” “Ohio,” and “sigma meal skibidi slicers.” In the ad, skibidi slicers are quesadillas, but the term evolved to mean any food."

      "content": "\"Sigma meal skibidi slicers”—or just “skibidi slicers”—refers to food. “Sigma meal skibidi slicers” is brainrot slang—it’s derived from Gel Alpha internet culture and is mostly meant to be silly. In the video where the phrase originated, a skibidi slicer is a quesadilla. [1] X Research source But since becoming popular in early 2024, the term has been adopted by Gen Alpha to mean any type of food, especially meals that are traditionally considered “kid food.” “ Sigma ” is a slang term for people who are cool without trying. It originated as an alternative to the “alpha male”—someone who does their own thing without worrying what others think. But it’s often just used as a silly slang term now. “ Skibidi ” is a reference to the absurdist Gen Alpha video series Skibidi Toilet. The videos feature a singing head coming out of a toilet, but the phrase “skibidi” has become a catch-all that can mean good, bad, or anything in between."

      "content": "The term comes from a video by content creator Grant Wisler. The video is called “ Commercials Trying To Be “Hip With The Kids” 2 .” It shows an ad for a fake restaurant called “Ky-Ty’s Grillin with Guys.” In the ad, the restaurant awkwardly uses popular slang terms to try to relate to kids and teens. The fake ad uses Gen Alpha phrases like “ gyatt ,” “ rizz ,” “ mewing ,” “ fanum tax ,” and “ Ohio ” while showing unappealing pictures of food like cold pizza and a yogurt cup. Near the end of the ad, the announcer says, “And don’t think we forgot about the children!” The ad cuts to someone saying, “Okay kids, here’s your—SIGMA MEAL SKIBIDI SLICERS!” then shows a quesadilla with a cut-out picture of skibidi toilet on the plate."
