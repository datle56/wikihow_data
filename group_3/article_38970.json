      "content": "Get a VLAN-capable managed switch. Most routers issued by your ISP don't support creating VLANs out of the box—you'll usually need to add a switch to your network if you want to create VLANs. If a switch is labeled as a managed or smart switch, it likely supports VLANs. However, double-check the product listing to look for VLAN or QoS support before purchase. Managed and smart switches usually have web-based admin interfaces (or mobile apps) that you can use to configure your VLANs. Other switches with VLAN support will require you to log in with a terminal app and run commands at a command prompt."

      "title": "Get a VLAN-capable router.",
      "content": "Get a VLAN-capable router. If your switch has a built-in DHCP server, you can use that to assign IP addresses on each VLAN. However, a lot of switches don't have DHCP support—in this case, you'll need to make sure your router supports VLANs so it can properly assign IP addresses from different subnets on each VLAN."

      "title": "Get VLAN-capable wireless access points.",
      "content": "Get VLAN-capable wireless access points. You'll need to connect your Wi-Fi access points to the switch so your guests can connect to a different SSID than your main network. You can purchase 2 Wi-Fi access points to accomplish this. Alternatively, you could get a single Wi-Fi access point that can broadcast at least two separate SSIDs—you can then tag and manage all traffic from each SSID separately. Either way, all guest Wi-Fi access would be routed through your primary gateway while remaining separate from your main traffic thanks to the VLAN-capabilities of your switch."

      "title": "Decide how to segment your network.",
      "content": "Decide how to segment your network. If you just want a separate VLAN for your guests, you'll actually need to create two VLANs—one for your main network and one for your guest network. This is the case whether you have two separate Wi-Fi access points or a single Wi-Fi access point with two SSIDs. Each VLAN will have its own subnet , and the router's DHCP server will assign IP addresses from that subnet to connected devices. [1] X Research source Consider whether your guests will need to access things like AirPlay or Chromecast devices while connected to the network—if your guests are connected to a VLAN that's isolated from these smart devices, they won't be able to use them. If these devices are specifically for guest use, you'll need to connect them to the guest VLAN rather than your main VLAN."

Here's an example of a basic 2-VLAN setup (one for guests and one for home users): Connect the WAN port of your VLAN-capable router to your modem's LAN port. Connect the main router LAN port to Port 1 of your switch. Connect your Wi-Fi access point(s) to the switch—Port 2 might be your main network, Port 3 (if you have two access points) for your guest network."

Make sure all VLANs include Port 1, which is your internet connection, as well as the port to which you've connected the Wi-Fi access point. Other than that, include only the ports you want to associate to each VLAN. [2] X Research source If you have one Wi-Fi access point with multiple SSIDs, add its port to all VLANs. Depending on your network setup, you might need to \"tag\" the VLAN traffic on the switch so it can be properly routed while staying separate. This is most common when using two separate switches. Label Port 1 (the internet connection) as \"untagged\" and the Wi-Fi port(s) as \"tagged.\" When devices connect to an access point, they'll be tagged with their VLAN IDs so the switch knows what to do with the connection. Check your switch's manual to find out the specific process for tagging and trunking. When tagging, set the PVID for Port 1 and your Wi-Fi access point port(s) to 1 . The PVID for all other ports should be set to correspond with its corresponding VLAN ID."
