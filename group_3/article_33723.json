      "content": "Possums and opossums are different animals. Although they have similar names and both are marsupials, possums have entirely different physical and behavioral traits than opossums. Opossums are the only marsupials native to North America, while possums are a species from Australia and New Guinea. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Opossums belong to a different animal order than possums. Opossums belong to the Didelphimorphia order, which is one family of marsupials. [2] X Research source Possums belong to the Diprotodontia order, which consists of 10 families found only in Australia, New Zealand, New Guinea, and surrounding islands. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "There are more possum species than opossum species. There are around 70 species of possums, with over 30 in Australia alone. In contrast, there are only a few dozen species of opossums in North America, with the Virginia opossum as the most common. [4] X Research source Australians are most familiar with the Common Brushtail and Ringtail possum."

      "content": "Opossums have hairless tails, while possums have furry ones. The opossum has a long, hairless tail that spans almost ⅓ of its total body length. [5] X Research source In contrast, the Australian possum has a thick, furry tail that helps it climb trees. [6] X Research source It’s a myth that adult opossums can hang upside down by their tail! Opossums have prehensile tails (able to easily grip objects) but they cannot support their entire body weight with just their tail. [7] X Research source"

      "title": "Opossums have gray fur, while possums have various-colored fur.",
      "content": "Opossums have gray fur, while possums have various-colored fur. Opossums are known for their streaked gray fur and pointed white faces. Possums also have pointed faces, but their coat comes in a wider range of colors–golden brown, silver-gray, and black. [8] X Research source Possums have smoother, silkier fur than opossums, making them a target of the fur trade industry in New Zealand. An average of 1.5 million possums are killed annually."

      "content": "Opossums are larger in size than possums. Opossums are around 2.5 feet (76 cm) from nose to tail, and they weigh between 9 pounds (4.1 kg) to 13 pounds (5.9 kg). [9] X Research source Possums are closer to 2 feet (61 cm) long and weigh between 3 pounds (1.4 kg) to 11 pounds (5.0 kg). [10] X Research source"

      "content": "Opossums “play dead” in defense, while possums exert scent marks. When threatened by predators, both creatures make hissing noises as a defense mechanism, but only opossums pretend to be sick/dead to avoid confrontation. [11] X Research source Possums are usually shy, but they will exert scent marks from their chest glands to mark territory. [12] X Research source When playing dead, opossums emit a foul scent to mimic death–it’s often described as corpse-like. [13] X Research source"

      "content": "Possums are friendly toward humans, while opossums are afraid. Unlike their North American counterparts, possums are friendly creatures adapted to humans and urban life. [14] X Research source Opossums are more fearful toward humans, so they're more likely to hiss or feign death than attack. Opossums rarely show aggression or bite humans, but mother opossums will attack to protect their young! [15] X Research source"

      "content": "Possums are mostly herbivores, while opossums are omnivores. The possum’s diet usually consists of fruit, flowers, and herbs, but they occasionally indulge in small insects or eggs. [16] X Research source Opossums scavenge for just about anything–fruit, insects, mice, and even venomous snakes! [17] X Research source It’s estimated that an opossum can eat up to 5,000 ticks per year, protecting humans and wildlife from Lyme disease. [18] X Research source"
