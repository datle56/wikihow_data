      "content": "Take a 0.5 in (1.3 cm) stack of tissues out of a tissue box. Open the side flap of a rectangular box of tissues and remove the top 0.5 in (1.3 cm) of folded tissues, making sure they stay together. Keep the stack facing upwards just as it was in the box so the starter tissue is on top. This measurement doesn’t need to be exact. Just make sure you don’t take out too thick of a section, otherwise they won’t all fit in the mason jar. Or, open a square or cylinder box of tissues and remove all the tissues in a bundle. Keep them in this bundle as best you can. [1] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Fold the tissues in half crosswise so the short edges meet.",
      "content": "Fold the tissues in half crosswise so the short edges meet. With the stack of tissues sitting flat in your hand, fold the short edges downwards to create a crosswise fold. The folded edge, which is the top tissue, will be facing upwards. If you’re using tissues from a square or cylinder package, skip this step and keep the tissues as they were in the box."

    {
      "title": "Pull up the first tissue on top so that it’s loose.",
      "content": "Pull up the first tissue on top so that it’s loose. Hold the bundle of tissues in place with one hand and use the other hand to pull up the top tissue so it’s slightly loose and easy to grab. This is the starting tissue in the roll. [2] X Research source For tissues from a cylinder, pinch and pull on the tissue at the center of the roll to get it started."
    },
    {
      "title": "Fold the tissues in half again lengthwise.",
      "content": "Fold the tissues in half again lengthwise. With the first tissue still facing vertically, loosely fold the bundle in half horizontally. Keep the top tissue free but still attached so you’ll be able to pull it through the mason jar lid easily. If you’re using tissues from a cylinder, skip this step, keeping the tissues in their original, cylindrical bundle."

      "title": "Stuff the tissues into the open jar with the loose tissue facing upwards.",
      "content": "Stuff the tissues into the open jar with the loose tissue facing upwards. Keep the tissues in their folded bundle and place them inside the empty mason jar with the lid off. Make sure the loose tissue stays on top."
    },
    {
      "title": "Pull the top tissue through the lid opening and screw the lid on.",
      "content": "Pull the top tissue through the lid opening and screw the lid on. With the loose tissue facing upwards, pull it gently through the slotted opening in the lid. When the tissue is pulled halfway through, screw the lid on tightly to start using the tissues. [3] X Research source Or, skip the lid and simply pull the tissues right out of the open jar."

    {
      "title": "Trace around the mason jar lid on a piece of felt.",
      "content": "Trace around the mason jar lid on a piece of felt. Set a piece of felt in your chosen color on a flat surface. Unscrew the mason jar and place the round metal circle that covers the top of the jar on the felt. Trace this using a marker or a pen and cut it out so it’s the same size as the lid. [4] X Research source Trace the flat round piece of metal that covers the opening of the jar, not the open piece that screws onto the jar. Or, trace it onto a piece of sturdy paper or soft plastic."

    {
      "title": "Cut an “X” shape in the felt for the tissues to come through.",
      "content": "Cut an “X” shape in the felt for the tissues to come through. Use a boxcutter to cut a large “X” into the center of the felt circle. If you don’t have a boxcutter, fold the piece of felt in half and cut a slit using scissors. Then fold the felt in half going the other direction and cut another slit to form an “X.” [5] X Research source Make the “X” large enough so that it almost reaches the edges of the felt, or about 1.5 in (3.8 cm) for each slit."

      "title": "Glue the piece of felt into the outer mason jar lid.",
      "content": "Glue the piece of felt into the outer mason jar lid. Place the part of the lid that screws onto the jar upside-down on a table. Squeeze a thin circle of craft glue along the lip of the lid, then place the felt into it, pressing down on it lightly so it sticks. Let the glue dry for 5-10 minutes before you use the lid. [6] X Research source Keep the lid off of the jar until you place the tissues in it."

      "title": "Wipe the inside and outside of the empty jar with a damp paper towel.",
      "content": "Wipe the inside and outside of the empty jar with a damp paper towel. This will get rid of any lingering dust or dirt. Wipe down the inside of the jar first and then the outside so your tissues will be sitting in a clean container. [7] X Research source A large, 32 fluid ounces (950 mL) mason jar works best, but any size will do."

      "title": "Paint the empty jar with acrylic paint to update the color, if you like.",
      "content": "Paint the empty jar with acrylic paint to update the color, if you like. This isn’t required—a clear mason jar tissue holder will look great too! If you’d like to paint it, use a paintbrush to apply at least 2 coats of craft paint or acrylic paint to the jar. Use even brush strokes and let the jar dry for 20-30 minutes in between layers. [8] X Research source Or, use modge podge and tissue paper to tint the jar for some more fun DIY coloring."

      "content": "Add extras like glitter or lettering to make your jar unique. Cover your jar in glitter, stickers, or ribbon to give it extra flair. You can even paint on wording like, \"Bless You!\" Add glitter while the paint is still wet or use glue so it sticks to the jar. If you're putting stickers on the jar, wait until the paint dries completely to make sure they stick."

      "content": "Place the tissues in the jar after the jar is dry. Wait until your paint or other decorations are completely dry (about 30 minutes to an hour) before putting the tissues in the jar and pulling the loose tissue through the lid. Once the lid is screwed on tightly, your mason jar tissue holder is ready to use! [9] X Research source"
