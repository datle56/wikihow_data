      "content": "Gather your materials. Creating a witch’s hat is easy and it only requires a few items. Before you get started, you will need: [1] X Research source black craft foam string scissors wire duct tape ribbon trim material such as feathers or faux fur embellishments such as plastic spiders, buttons, or bows"

      "title": "Measure and cut your foam into a cone shape.",
      "content": "Measure and cut your foam into a cone shape. Take your string and hold the end at the corner of your craft foam. Then, extend the string several inches with your pencil in hand. Use the string and your pencil to trace the bottom of the cone. You can make the cone as tall as you would like it to be. [2] X Research source When you have finished tracing the curved line for your cone bottom, use your scissors to cut along this line. When you are done, you should have a triangular piece of craft foam with a circular bottom. You can also use an Exacto knife to get more precise edges as you cut out your craft foam, but it is not necessary. [3] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Cut your wire.",
      "content": "Cut your wire. Next, cut a piece of wire that is slightly shorter than the tallest part of your cone. You can measure the cone from the base to the tip to see how long to make your wire piece or just hold the wire against the cone and make the cut. [4] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Tape the wire to the center of the cone.",
      "content": "Tape the wire to the center of the cone. Lay your piece of wire onto the center part of the cone shape, as if you are dividing the cone in half with the wire. One end of the wire should be at the pointy end of the cone and the other end should be at the base. Then, take a piece of duct tape that is longer than the wire and apply it over the wire lengthwise. [5] X Research source Make sure that there is a little space between the end of the wire and the edge of the cone when you tape it down. Otherwise, the wire may poke through the top of the hat or poke you in the head when you are wearing it. Trim off any excess duct tape after you have secured the wire to the cone. There should not be any duct tape going over the edge of the craft foam."

    {
      "title": "Apply more duct tape to one edge.",
      "content": "Apply more duct tape to one edge. You will need to apply a couple of pieces of duct tape to the edge of the hat to secure the edges and form your cone. Take a piece of duct tape and secure it to the flat edge of the cone and then apply another piece over that one so that it overlaps a bit. [6] X Research source Then, fold over the other edge of the cone and press the duct tape in place to secure the edges. Make sure that the wire and the duct tape are on the inside of the cone when you secure the edges."

      "title": "Measure and cut the brim.",
      "content": "Measure and cut the brim. To create the hat brim, you will need to lay out another piece of craft foam and hold a piece of string in the center. Then, holding your pencil and the other end of the string in the other hand, draw a circle. This circle will be the brim for the cone shape, so make sure that it is large enough. [7] X Research source After you have measured the brim, cut along the edges of the circle you have traced. Try to cut along the line as evenly as possible because any jagged edges will show."

When you have finished cutting out your brim, lay it out on the table again and use a heat gum or blow dryer to flatten out any curved edges. [8] X Research source If your brim is already pretty flat, then you do not need to worry about flattening it more. [9] X Research source You can also lay a couple of heavy books on the craft foam and leave them on for a few hours or overnight to flatten out the brim piece."

      "content": "Cut out the center of the brim piece. Next, fold the brim piece in half so that the edges are even. Make a cut in the center of the brim piece and then move outwards. Keep cutting until you have created a small circle in the center of the brim piece. Then, cut four slits in the inner edges of the brim piece to add some more flexibility. [10] X Research source Keep in mind that the inner circle will need to be large enough to fit over your head, but not larger than your head or it may be too loose."

      "title": "Check to make sure that the brim fits on your head.",
      "content": "Check to make sure that the brim fits on your head. Try the brim on your head before you move on to make sure that it is a good fit. If it feels to snug, then you can adjust it. If it is too loose, then you will need to create a new brim with a new piece of craft foam. [11] X Research source"

      "title": "Use ribbon to cover the seam of the cone.",
      "content": "Use ribbon to cover the seam of the cone. Before you attached the cone to the brim, you can cover up the cone seam with a piece of black ribbon. Use your hot glue to secure the ribbon to the cone. [12] X Research source Make sure that your glue gun is completely heated before you begin gluing ribbon to the cone. Hold the glue gun close to the foam as you apply the hot glue. Otherwise, the glue may dry partially before you have secured the ribbon to the cone."

To glue the brim to the cone, apply hot glue to the base of the cone and press the cone into the hat brim. [13] X Research source Make sure that the cone is centered over the hat brim as you secure it with hot glue. If you want to embellish your hat, you can also apply some feathers or faux fur to the area where the cone meets the brim. Just use your hot glue gun to secure your embellishments to the base of the cone. [14] X Research source"

      "content": "Bend the cone how you want. After you have completed your hat and the glue is dry, you can shape the cone how you would like it to look by bending it slightly. The wire inside of the cone will allow you to create a bent or crushed shape to the cone of your hat. [15] X Research source Try bending the cone in two or three places to give it a worn look."
