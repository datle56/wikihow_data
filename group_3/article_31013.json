      "content": "Fairy Garden House Grab a leftover metal or tin can that’s the right size and shape for your fairy house. Roll out an ultra-thin (1 centimetre (10 mm)) layer of white clay , making the shape large enough to cover the sides of the can. Optionally, use a vine- or flower-patterned clay roller to add texture and decoration. Gently wrap the white clay around the tin can and press to adhere. Roll out a small, thin square of green clay and cut out 2-4 bushes. Roll out a small, thin square of yellow clay and cut out a door. Roll out a small, thin square of blue clay and cut out two windows. [1] X Research source Gently place and press each decorative item onto the white clay that’s on the can. Arrange the bushes to sit on either side of the doors. Feel free to add more decor if you want—add red clay hearts, a black clay doorknob, or anything else you can dream up! Depending on your clay type, place the entire can (covered with the clay) onto a baking sheet and into the oven. Bake according to your clay’s package directions. Take your project out of the oven and let it cool completely before handling. If you’re using air-dry clay, let it sit for 24 hours until dry. To make the roof of your house, cut out a circle of aluminum foil that’s about 8 inches (200 mm) in diameter. Cut a slit from one edge of the circle into the center, then overlap the cut ends to create a cone. Stuff the inside of the cone with pieces of aluminum foil so that it’s sturdier and can sit upright. Cut out about 30-45 petal-shaped pieces of clay in whatever array of colors that you like. Layer the petals in rows from the bottom of the foil cone to the top. Allow your clay to air dry or bake this piece in the oven according to package directions, then allow it to cool before using super glue to attach it to the top of the house."

      "content": "Bees & Flowers Tic Tac Toe Board Make the bees by rolling 6 pieces of yellow clay into small cylindrical shapes. Roll 6 small pieces of black clay into snake shapes, then wind these “snakes” around the yellow cylinders to create a bee’s stripes. Roll 12 tiny circles of black clay, then gently press two of each onto one end of each bee's body to give them eyes. For each bee, make two small balls of white clay and press them between your thumb and forefinger to make wings. Gently press them on top of the bee bodies. [2] X Research source To make the flowers , roll 30 mini balls of pink clay (5 for each flower). Roll 6 mini balls of yellow clay (1 for each flower). For each flower, press the 5 pink balls (the petals) around the yellow ball (the flower’s center) to create a complete flower. Repeat until you have 6 full flowers. Roll a large ball of green clay into a circle that’s 1.5 centimetres (15 mm) thick and at least 12 by 12 centimetres (120 mm × 120 mm) wide. Cut the clay into a 9 by 9 centimetres (90 mm × 90 mm) square, then use black or brown acrylic paint to draw a 3 x 3 grid onto the square. Let the clay air dry or bake each piece separately according to your package directions, then allow them to cool before handling. If bees and flowers aren’t your thing, there are tons of variations on the tic-tac-toe board! You can do peppermint candies and marshmallows on a brown “cocoa” board, blueberries and butter on a brown “waffle” board, or frogs and toadstools on a green “lilypad” board."

Roll out a ball of clay into a circle that’s at least 1 ⁄ 2 inch (13 mm) thick. Wrap the aluminum egg in the clay. Pick out an assortment of rocks , seashells, beads , glass, and any other trinkets you have collected. If you’re using oven-bake clay, only use items that are marked for safe use in the oven. [3] X Research source Push your treasure trove of items into the clay egg, deep enough so that they stick in the clay and don’t fall out. Cure your clay according to package directions.

Use a dull knife to carefully cut around the handprint, and use your fingers to smooth around the edges. Use a straw, pencil, or other small and circular object to make a hole at the base of the palm. Let your clay dry or bake it according to package directions. Then, paint the clay with a layer of white paint . [4] X Research source Let the white paint dry, then use a black Sharpie to draw on a smiley face. Orient the face so that the bottom of the handprint is the top of the ghost’s head. Use pink acrylic paint to create two dots under the drawn-on eyes—these are the cute ghost cheeks! Let the paint and Sharpie fully dry, then brush Modge Podge all over the ghosts to seal them.

Lay the cylinders side by side, then gently push them together with your hands until they’re lightly stuck together. Flatten the colors together with a rolling pin, creating a single color block that’s about 1 ⁄ 16 – 1 ⁄ 8 inch (1.6–3.2 mm) thick throughout. Now that you have this block, use a clay cutter in your desired shape (e.g., circle, square, star, heart, etc.) to cut the earrings out. [7] X Research source Take an empty earring post and use the sharp end to gently create a hole at the top of each shape. Wiggle the post around a bit to make a large enough hole. Remove the earring posts and lay your earrings completely flat on a parchment paper-lined baking sheet. Following your clay package’s instructions, let the earrings air dry or bake until set. When your earring shapes are dried and/or cool, put a dab of super glue and place an earring post at the top of each one. Hold each post firmly for at least 30 seconds. Once you get the hang of forming earrings out of polymer or air-dry clay, you can make more earrings in pretty much any shape, style, or color that you want! So, if these particular earrings aren’t your favorite, then you can DIY your own with ease."

Use the bottom of a spoon to create two vertical, parallel lines on the flat sides of your popsicle. [8] X Research source Next, use a toothpick to carefully poke a hole into the bottom of your popsicle. Make a small, snake-shaped roll out of some light brown clay . Insert the end of this tubular shape (the popsicle stick!) into the hole you made. Take an eye pin and carefully place it into the top of your popsicle—if needed, shorten the end of the pin with a pair of scissors. Bake or dry your clay popsicles according to package directions.

Optionally, create a shorter brown “snake” and attach it as a basket handle. [9] X Research source Now, it’s time to make the veggies to go into your basket! Roll tiny pieces of orange clay into tapered cones to make carrots. Add super small and thin green “snakes” to the top of each “carrot.” Carefully score each carrot with the tip of a knife. Roll tiny pieces of white clay into balls to make onions. Add long but thin green “snakes” to the top of each “onion.” Roll tiny pieces of red clay into balls to make tomatoes. Arrange each vegetable and basket individually on a parchment paper-lined baking sheet. Follow your clay’s package directions to air dry or bake your clay until set and cooled. Decide if you want to be able to remove your veggies from the basket or if you want to have them attached. You can also do some attached and some removable! If you’re certain that you don’t want some (or all) of your veggies to be removable, add a drop of super glue to them and place them in the bottom of the basket.

Place your templates onto the rolled-out clay and cut out the shapes from the clay with plastic modeling tools . Use one of these modeling tools to score the areas where you’d like to add details (this will give you a 3D effect in these areas). If you’re using a multi-part template where you need to assemble the base, brim, and top of the hat together, apply clay slip to the base before pressing the hat’s brim and top to the base. Depending on your clay’s instructions, leave it out to dry or bake it in the oven until firm. Once your clay is completely dry and/or cool, paint it in your preferred color with acrylic paint. Let that base layer dry, then decorate however you’d like. For a classic look, use a cotton bud to paint cow print onto the hat in a different shade than the base one. Once your paint has dried, apply varnish or Modge Podge to seal the paint and clay."

Pinch the three “snakes” together at one end, then twist them together so that they create a single sausage-like shape. Twist small flame-shaped pieces from this “sausage” and place them on top of the “logs” to complete the fire. Use different colors of clay to create more food items, like a blue fish, a pink fish, a grey rat, an orange carrot, etc. Create a “drumstick” by rolling a brown piece of clay into a ball, then attaching a cylindrical bone-shaped piece of white clay to the end. Tie together a pair of craft sticks with twine to create a bottomless triangle shape, then repeat. Secure the untied bottom of each popsicle stick in gray clay rocks. Poke a skewer through the piece of clay meat to create a hole— if you’re using oven-bake clay, remove the skewer and popsicle sticks before baking, then reinsert them once the clay has cooled . Once dried and/or cooled according to package instructions, assemble your Stone Age cooking scene. Use the popsicle stick triangles as frames for the skewer (or “cooking spit”). Hang the other foods on the skewer or set them on the ground around the campfire."

Roll one snake shape into a spiral to create the base of the pot. Use a clay modeling tool to smooth out the top of the spiral, then use scoring tools to create texture around the edge of the base. Brush a small amount of clay slip over the areas where you scored the clay. [21] X Research source Take another snake shape and bond one end to the open end of the base—if they’re not bonding easily, score both ends and apply some clay slip before trying again. Repeat this step, each time winding the coils in slightly wider circles in order to build the walls of the pot outwards. Once you’ve achieved your desired pot height, use modeling tools and your fingers to smooth the surface of the pot all over. Follow your clay’s package instructions to dry or bake (and cool) the pot. Then, paint the pot with your desired colors and patterns. You could draw stripes, squiggles, or polka dots. You could also paint the pot a solid color or add a fun word or message.

Once the clay is rolled up completely, curve the ends gently to sculpt it into a croissant shape. Then, take a thick 4 by 6 inches (100 mm × 150 mm) piece of plastic or cardstock and insert it into the top of the croissant to create a slit. This slit is where the photo will be held once the croissant is cured. If you’re using air-dry clay , leave the paper or plastic in the slit until the clay completely dries. If you’re using oven-bake clay, remove the paper or plastic before baking according to package directions—if you’re worried about the slit losing shape in the oven, replace the paper or plastic with a thick piece of aluminum foil. Once the clay croissant has set, dried, and cooled completely, paint it with acrylic paint. For a more realistic look, paint the entire item a light brown color, then paint each folded edge with a slightly darker brown shade for a “baked” look. Optionally, paint a smiley face onto the croissant with pink dots for cheeks, black eyes, and a black smile.
