      "content": "Add preppy emojis to your Instagram, TikTok, or other social media bios. A social media bio is an introduction to who you are and what you post online. Make your profile extra aesthetically pleasing by adding some cute, preppy emojis. One way to incorporate preppy emojis into your bio is to place them at the start and end of your existing bio. For example, if your bio is “PVHS ‘26,” you can update it to “🧸 PVHS ‘26 🎀.” You can add additional emojis below your bio’s text (for example, “📍NYC” followed by 🪩🎧☕️), or put them between words if you’d like to use more. Another option is to replace your entire bio with preppy emojis. They can reflect a preppy hobby you like, your favorite color, the current season, or simply which emojis you find the cutest. For example, a winter-themed preppy emoji bio could be 🤍☃️🫶🦢. A ballet-themed bio could be 🩰🪩💕🪞. If you’d rather leave your bio as is, put preppy emojis around your username instead. For example, “jackie” could become “🛼 jackie 💖” and “Alexa W” could become “🎾 Alexa W 🎾.” On platforms like Instagram, other users will see your username when you look at their story or like their posts."

Because they’re less common than emojis, they add a unique flair to a bio or caption—although not all will appear on every web browser, device, or social media platform.
