      "content": "Hold the pan flute with both hands. Hold the long tube end of the flute in a handshake grip with your right hand. Position the flute vertically so that the tubes are parallel to your body. Use your left hand to gently hold the end of the flute with the short tubes. The pan flute is typically curved. Position the flute’s curve toward your body. Keep the pan flute horizontally aligned with your head. So if your head tilts one way or the other, the flute should also tilt to remain aligned with your head. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Form the correct embouchure. Your embouchure is the positioning and shaping of your mouth and lips in order to control your airflow when you play a pan flute. To form your embouchure, first make a slight smile and purse your lips a bit. [2] X Research source Make a small opening between your lips. Position the pan flute against your bottom lip and direct air into the pipe’s tube, just like you would if you blew into a bottle. Move the bottom of the flute slightly away from your or closer to you to adjust the direction of the air flow into the tube. Adjust the position of the tube’s top higher or lower depending on your mouth and lips to produce a good quality sound. [3] X Research source Tighten up your lips/embouchure when you are playing the higher notes (shorter tubes). Relax your embouchure when you play lower notes (longer tubes). [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Blow air into the pan flute. Once your body is positioned correctly, you are ready to play the flute. Blow a steady, strong stream of air through your embouchure into one of the pan flute’s tubes.

When you blow air into the flute, you can alter the resulting sound by moving your tongue to pronounce different consonant letter sounds. The primary letter sound you use when playing a pan flute is a T sound. You can also make B, P, or D sounds to subtly change the pan flute sound. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Play half-notes on your pan flute. A musical scale has full notes (such as C, B, A) and half-notes (such as C sharp, E flat, and so on). The tubes on a pan flute produce full notes, but you can use different playing techniques to achieve half-notes and therefore expand the repertoire of music you can play. To play half-notes, try one of these techniques: Tilt the flute : Tilt the bottom of the pan flute away from you so that your lower lip covers part of the tube opening. [6] X Research source Draw the flute down slightly against your lip at the same time. Retract your jaw : You can also retract your jaw to play half-notes. Pull your chin backwards while directing air into one of the tubes. [7] X Research source"

A bent note is one sound that starts as a flat note sound and moves upward to land on the correct note, or a sharp note sound and moves downward to land on the correct note. To bend a note: Tilt flute away from your body to bend a note downward. Keep the airflow constant. [8] X Research source"

A common scale starts with C and goes up to the next C (C, D, E, F, G, A, B, C). Play each note as a separate, clean note. Practice different techniques while moving up and down the musical scale, working on staccato sounds and vibrato sounds. Practice a scale with half-notes. On each tube, play the regular note and then play the half note by tilting the flute toward or away from your body."

The longest pipe is number 1, with each successive pipe as 2, 3, and so on. The shortest pipe is number 8.
