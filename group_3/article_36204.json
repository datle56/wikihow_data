      "content": "Pull the earring apart, keeping a firm grip on the front and back. Pull the butterfly back off the post, and the post out of the safety back. Once the backing has been safely removed, you may remove the earring from the piercing. You may also carefully pull the safety back and stud in opposite directions at the same time.

      "content": "Wiggle the backing if it has become stuck. If the backing is stuck, or the butterfly backing has become crooked, wiggle the backing until it comes off or until it becomes easy to pull off. If the butterfly backing has been pushed too far, use a bobby pin to carefully pull on the butterfly back. Hook a bobby pin to the butterfly back, and use something hard, like tweezers, and push the post. The idea is to push the backing into a place where you can then wiggle or pull it off.
