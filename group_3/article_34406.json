      "content": "Take your cuttings in late spring for the best chance of growth. Christmas cacti generally start growing around May and bloom in November or December. It's best to take cuttings at the beginning of the growing season in early spring. This gives the cactus time to emerge from its post-blooming rest period and initiate new growth. [1] X Research source Technically, you can take your cuttings any time during the year, but doing it in early spring gives you the best chance of successfully growing a new, healthy plant."

[2] X Research source In addition, look for a branch that has at least 2 cladophylls (branch segments), since cuttings generally need at least 2 branch segments to take root. You can generally take multiple cuttings from a healthy host plant without harming it, but don't take off too much. [3] X Research source"

Remove 2 to 5 of the flattened segments of the branch by pinching them off at the joint with your fingers. You may need to twist and fold the branch at the joint to loosen it up enough so you can pinch the segments off. [4] X Research source You can also cut the segments off at the joint with a small knife. [5] X Research source"

In most cases, you can leave it out to dry for up to 2 days. [6] X Research source If you leave the cutting out for several days, it may start to wilt at the ends. If this happens, pinch off the wilted end segments so only the healthy segments remain. [7] X Research source"

While your cuttings are drying, fill a small pot with a drain hole to the brim with a Christmas cactus rooting medium, such as perlite, coarse sand, or a half and half combination of the two.
