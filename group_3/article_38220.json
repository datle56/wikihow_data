      "content": "Pronounce the vowel sounds. If you want to say love in Latin you need to get to grips with pronunciation in Latin. Key to this is recognising long and short vowel sounds. In Latin these variations are shown by the diacritic marks above the letters a, e, i, o, and u. Short vowels are indicated like this: ă, ĕ, ĭ, ŏ, ŭ. Long vowels are indicated like this: ā, ē, ī, ō, ū. These diacritical marks are not part of the spelling of the word, they just indicate long and short vowels for pronunciation. If you were writing Latin you wouldn’t include these marks. To say “love” in Latin you need to concentrate on pronouncing the long vowels correctly. ā: as in the English father, not the [æ] in fat, or [ə] in apart. ē: as in the English they, but longer. Not the [ei] as \"ey\" in they, or [ə] in apart, or [i:] in ecology. ī: as in the English sheep. Not as [ai]. ō: as in the Italian ó in amore. ū: as in English root. Not as [ju:] you, or French \"u\", German \"ü\". [1] X Research source"
