Wear rubber gloves to protect your hands from the hot water. You might get a little wet if the water spills over the side. [5] X Research source Agitate the sheets at least once when you first soak them and once at the end. Depending on how long you are leaving them to soak, you can agitate them 1-3 times more at regular intervals."

[20] X Research source If you have a top-loading machine, open the door and pour the vinegar in. If you have a front-loading machine, open the dispenser on the top and add the vinegar. Some machines may lock the doors or dispensers while the machine is on. In this case, add the vinegar at the beginning of the cycle or choose another method.
