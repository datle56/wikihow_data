      "title": "Brush your teeth",
      "content": "Brush your teeth twice a day. One of the best ways to treat gum pockets is to brush on a regular basis. Use a soft-bristled toothbrush and brush your teeth gently, as hard bristles and rough brushing can cause the gums to recede further. However, brushing both morning and night will help remove all of the food and bacteria that gets lodged in the pockets. [2] X Research source If you are really focused on reducing your gum pockets, try brushing after every meal. This will prevent the area that needs to heal from being exposed to more bacteria and food."

      "content": "Opt for using an electric toothbrush. Make sure your electric toothbrush is charged. Once it has power, put a small amount of toothpaste on it, put it in your mouth, and then turn it on. Clean your teeth in quadrants, focusing on one quarter of your mouth at a time. When done, turn off the toothbrush, spit out your toothpaste, rinse out your mouth, and rinse off the brush head. [3] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source An electric toothbrush will be able to clean down deeper into the pockets than a traditional toothbrush. Since it’s better at cleaning below the gum line, it’s a good idea to use one if you are trying to help your gums heal."

      "title": "Floss",
      "content": "Floss at least once a day. Floss can get in between the teeth and remove food that a toothbrush just can’t get. When flossing, use about 18 inches (46 cm) of floss, hold it between your thumb and forefinger in each hand, and insert it between your teeth using a rubbing motion. Once between your teeth, wrap it in a “c” shape against each of the teeth it is between and rub the area gently. It's important not to snap the floss into the space between teeth, as this can injure the gums. Using a gradual rubbing motion instead will prevent the chance of injuring the gums further."

      "title": "Use a water flosser",
      "content": "Use a water flosser to clean between your teeth and gums. Water flossers are machines that clean by shooting water between the gums and the teeth. To use one, you fill the water reservoir with water, position the head so it’s pointed at your teeth, and turn on the machine. Once the water flosser is going, follow the gum line and clean between all of your teeth. They are available at most big box stores, as well as from online retailers. While dental floss can get down a few millimeters into your gum pockets, water flosser machines can get down much further. This helps to clean out all the germs and debris in the pockets that could make them bigger."
