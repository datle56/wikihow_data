      "content": "Measure your wrist with a flexible tape measure. Wrap the tape measure tightly around your wrist, just below your hand, where you would wear your bracelet. Note the number where the tape overlaps. [1] X Research source If you're having trouble wrapping the tape measure around your wrist with your non-dominant hand, get help from a friend."

      "content": "Wrap a piece of string around your wrist and measure the string, alternatively. This is a great alternative if you don't have a flexible tape measure at hand. Simply wrap the string tightly around your wrist and cut it where it overlaps. Then hold the string up to a ruler and measure it. [2] X Research source Yarn, ribbon, or even a strip of paper can work instead of string."

      "title": "Add .8 inches (2.0 cm) to your wrist measurement to find your bracelet size.",
      "content": "Add .8 inches (2.0 cm) to your wrist measurement to find your bracelet size. Whether you measured your wrist with a tape measure or with a piece of string, Pandora bracelets should be about .8 inches (2.0 cm) larger than the size of your wrist. For example, if your wrist is 8.2 inches, they recommend getting a bracelet that's 9.0 inches long, to make sure it is loose enough to fit comfortably. You can see a Pandora bracelet size chart here: https://us.pandora.net/en/guide-size-bracelets/guide-size-bracelets.html ."

      "content": "Go to the jewelry store and have the salespeople help (if needed). If you're really not sure about which size of bracelet to buy, go into the jewelry store and have the salespeople help you. The salespeople have lots of experience with Pandora bracelets, and so they'll know what size will be comfortable for your wrist. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Try on the bracelet to see if it feels comfortable.",
      "content": "Try on the bracelet to see if it feels comfortable. Some people like their bracelets tighter and some people like them looser. You just have to make sure the bracelet is loose enough that it doesn't cut off your circulation, and tight enough that it doesn't accidentally slip off. If the bracelet leaves a mark on your wrist, then it's too tight, and you should get a size bigger. [4] X Research source Wear your bracelet for a few days and see how it feels. If need be, you might be able to exchange it for a different size if it's still within warranty."

      "title": "Fit 2 fingers underneath the bracelet for the ideal fit.",
      "content": "Fit 2 fingers underneath the bracelet for the ideal fit. If you can fit 2 fingers under the bracelet while it is clasped around your wrist, then the bracelet is not too tight. This makes sure the bracelet has enough room to move around without chafing. [5] X Research source If you can't fit 2 fingers underneath your bracelet, you also won't have room for many charms! Some people prefer a tighter bracelet, with just 1 finger fitting under."

      "content": "Decide how many charms you want to put on your bracelet. If you are going to load up your bracelet with a lot of large charms, then you might want to consider getting a Pandora bracelet that's a size bigger on the size chart. You can also add about .5 inches (1.3 cm) to your original measurement, to accommodate the bulk of the charms. [6] X Research source Glass charms are especially bulky, so if you have some of those you want to put on, it might be worth going a size up."

      "title": "Distribute your charms evenly around the bracelet to prevent stretch.",
      "content": "Distribute your charms evenly around the bracelet to prevent stretch. Some people find that their Pandora bracelets stretch out over time. This is generally because the heavier charms pull on the bracelet. To avoid stretch, make sure to distribute the charms evenly around the bracelet with the help of spacers, small rings that go between heavier charms. [7] X Research source You can buy spacers to place between your charms to fill out empty places on your bracelet, or to bookend a charm you want to draw attention to. [8] X Research source"
