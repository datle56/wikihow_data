Instead, it tests your past use of drugs over the past few days or even weeks. Habitual drug users often have higher concentrations of the drug in their systems than occasional drug users. For this reason, habitual drug users may test positively for drugs even after being sober for several days or weeks.

This is accomplished by adding fluid to the sample, and some sites online may recommend it. However, drug testing laboratories all routinely test samples to detect dilution. One method of diluting the sample involves adding liquid to urine. However, the temperature of the urine is measured by drug tests, and diluted urine is easily detected. Another method of diluting the sample is to flush your system by drinking excessive amounts of water. However, drinking excessive amounts of water can be dangerous (people have died from water intoxication) and risky because colorless urine arouses suspicion, possibly flagging the sample. You will likely be asked to provide another sample after a few hours, which will not be enough time for your body to rid itself of drug traces."

While excessive flushing will likely lead to a failed urine test, you may be able to slightly lower the concentration of THC in your urine if you are well hydrated. For those who have not used marijuana for several days, this might make a significant difference in your drug test result. In order to provide an optimal urine sample, you can: [9] X Trustworthy Source University of Rochester Medical Center Leading academic medical center in the U.S. focused on clinical care and research Go to source Drink 3-4 glasses of water the morning of your test. Pee at least twice before providing a urine sample. Your early morning urine will have the highest concentration of drugs in your system. Give your body some time to flush these chemicals out, and never use your first pee of the day in a drug test. Drink a coffee or caffeinated soda. Caffeine is a mild diuretic, which can help your body flush out fluids more quickly."

      "title": "Beware of advice that tells you to substitute the sample.",
      "content": "Beware of advice that tells you to substitute the sample. Substitution is a method that involves substituting your urine with that of another person's or a synthetic sample. There are many companies that sell devices for urine substitution over the internet, as well as companies that sell synthetic urine. Be aware that defrauding the urine test might be a crime. In many states, it is illegal to substitute someone else's urine for your own. This could be considered an act of criminal fraud, and you might be putting your job, employment, or legal status at risk. Consider carefully whether it is worth the risk to attempt to defraud a urine test. Synthetic urine comes in two basic forms: the liquid type found in smoke shops that is similar to what is used to calibrate lab equipment; or vials of a powdered concentrate that can be added to a few ounces of warm water. Both are kept in a delivery device with a temperature meter. One of the challenges of urine substitution is ensuring that the urine remains at a normal body temperature (91-97 degrees Fahrenheit). Some labs are now testing for synthetic urine. For your legal protection, it is critical that you do not use this method for any government tests including military, civil service, and especially probation. The liquid premixed urine has a couple of drawbacks as it doesn't have a head or small layer of bubbles on the surface and it has no smell. Powdered synthetic urine does. Many labs and collection sites will reject your specimen if they suspect it is synthetic and ask you to urinate under direct observation. Substituting another person's urine might also be risky, since it is possible that they will not pass the drug test either. Urine also darkens over time, and bacteria can grow, contaminating the sample. If deterioration becomes noticeable the lab may suspect something."

The traces of the drug then get filtered through the hair, leading to a failed drug test. Hair drug testing can show the drugs a person may have used over the past several months. It is a more accurate test of long-term drug use than a urine or blood test. A hair drug test involves cutting 50-80 strands of hair from the back of the head, close to the crown. Note that even though the drug test is often referred to as a \"hair follicle\" test, your skin will not be broken in this test. A minimum length of 1.5 inches of head hair is necessary for the test. If this length of hair is unavailable (such as when the person being tested has a crew cut), body hair such as face, chest, or arm hair can be used."

A single, minor use of a drug is much less likely to lead to a failed hair drug test, though it can happen. If you have only smoked a single joint in the past 3 months, you can be cautiously hopeful that you will pass the drug test. However, if you had a period of time where you smoked a joint every day for a week, you are much more likely to fail the drug test."

For example, your hair sample is often collected by a lab assistant directly since there are no privacy concerns (as there are for a urine sample). There are no chemical masking agents or dilution methods that can lower toxins in the hair. And a temporary stoppage of drug use is not sufficient to pass most hair drug tests. The very high success rate of the hair drug tests is precisely why many employers and legal agencies use them. It is particularly difficult for people with dark colored hair to fool a hair follicle test. For this reason, there are many claims that hair drug tests are ethnically biased and racist.

Cocaine (including crack): From time of ingestion up to 2 to 3 days. Opiates: From time of ingestion up to 2 to 3 days. Methamphetamine and ecstasy: From time of ingestion up to 2 to 3 days.

The ADA also says you can't discriminate against prospective employees on the basis of past drug-related problems. Then again, you may refuse to hire people if you have reason to believe they will return to substance abuse or endanger the safety and health of your workers.
