Note that this method is rather risky, as failure to follow the steps exactly will lead to a notification being sent. Consider testing this method with a friend first! Unfortunately, this method only works on Android. If you have an iPhone or iPad, users will still see a notification that you've taken a screenshot. While you could open an untimed snap right now and still successfully complete this process, it may be difficult to activate Airplane Mode while viewing a time-sensitive picture."
