Type in your search for a book by name or category in the \"Items\" field, then click the \"Search\" button to the right of the search box. Expand your search. Search for Libraries, or to see what libraries exist in the system, or search for member-created lists. Either way, to expand your search, click the drop-down to the left of the search box, and click either \"Libraries\" or \"Lists\". After that, click into the search box and search away."

      "title": "Open up your search a little further.",
      "content": "Open up your search a little further. Use the Advanced Search feature, found to the right of the \"Search\" button, both on the regular website and the mobile-responsive website. This feature gives you three initial search boxes - \"Keyword\", \"Title\", and \"Author\" - but these can be changed at any time with each line's drop-down box to the left of each search box. However, don't skip a line. Instead, use the drop-down for each line and don't type anything in lines you don't want to use. Use the Boolean search term boxes to the right of the search boxes, if you'd like. You can either leave the Boolean boxes on \"AND\", or change them to \"OR\" or \"NOT\", depending on your search term. If you have more than 3 lines of search terms, you can add another line via the \"+\" button just below the second Boolean button, and it will expand this search area by one additional line. Learn about the other search topic labels you can provide. You will have access to the following by clicking the drop-down: \"ISBN\", \"ISSN\", \"Journal Name\", \"OCLC\", \"Publisher\", and \"Subject\". Think about other search types - including \"Year,\" \"Format,\" and \"Language.\" With Year, you'll provide an approximate year of publication. If you're sure a book was published in a certain year, type the same year in both \"Year\" boxes. Format is a very long list, and even contains non-book entries that can often be stored in libraries. Select your publication format from the list. Language is another long list, and refers to the language the book was written in."

Although the component page contains all basic information firsthand, with a click of the \"Show more information\" button, it opens additional details for books or by scrolling down and reading, you can find member libraries. You should be able to find most books within the WorldCat system. Within \"Show more information,\" you can read through cataloging details such as the book's genre, physical description, ISBN, OCLC Number-Unique Identifier, Subject, and/or Notes. Physical description gives page totals, types of illustrations, and approximate longest dimension (in cm). Once you arrive at the book's page on WorldCat, you can also find a button to create a citation for the book, if necessary."
