      "content": "Rubbing alcohol Dip a cotton ball or cloth in a little bit of rubbing alcohol . Dab the area lightly to saturate the spot and let it sit for a few minutes. Use a clean damp cloth to dab away the residue. Repeat until the stain is completely gone. [1] X Research source Alternatively, use un-flavored vodka (or any clear spirit above 40% alcohol) or nail polish remover in place of rubbing alcohol. Rubbing alcohol can remove varnish and damage wood if you use too much of it. Try not to apply too much rubbing alcohol to the area and avoid rubbing to remove the stain."

      "content": "Toothpaste House cleaning professional Guy Peters suggests using toothpaste for finished and unfinished wood. Apply a dollop to the stain and use “a sponge or thick cloth” to “rub the area with small circles,” following the grain of the wood. “Use a damp cloth to remove any extra toothpaste and repeat as needed.” White baking soda toothpaste works best because it’s slightly abrasive. If you don’t have that, just add 1 teaspoon (6 g) of baking soda to 1 teaspoon of your regular toothpaste. [2] X Research source However, Guy Peters recommends avoiding “gel toothpastes since they won’t work at all” for removing stains."

      "content": "Rubbing alcohol or nail polish remover Wet a cotton ball or paper towel with rubbing alcohol or nail polish remover. Gently dab the stain until it’s saturated with the solution. Use a second cotton ball or paper towel to blot the stain. Repeat this process until it’s completely removed. [11] X Research source Use a damp cloth to remove the excess alcohol, then allow the area to air dry completely. Rubbing alcohol works well on chenille, cotton, linen, vinyl, and velvet. Nail polish remover is a little more aggressive and may work best on thicker, more durable fabrics like canvas. If you’re dealing with leather, try testing hand sanitizer on an unseen corner to see how it reacts. If it goes well, apply it to the stain using this step."
