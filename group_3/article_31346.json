Ninjas were covert spies and mercenaries in feudal Japan in the 15th century AD that were trained in a fighting discipline called Ninjutsu. [1] X Research source Today, they are popularized in movies and games as stealthy fighters who are notoriously difficult to see, catch, or track down. A lot of times, people use 🥷 (ninja) to refer to a literal ninja (real or fictional).

Just like actual ninjas, a person might send this emoji to show they’re trying to be secretive or show that the information they’re sharing is confidential. If someone sends a 🥷 (ninja) with their message, it’s a good idea to keep your lips sealed!

You’ve probably heard something like “I’m a poker ninja” in conversation before, and it shows up in text and social media, too.

[6] X Research source This could occur in private text messages or on social media as a way to work around moderators looking for hate speech. If you see a 🥷 (ninja) in any context that’s not explicitly about actual ninjas or stealthy activities, do not engage.
