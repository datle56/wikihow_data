      "content": "Know about \"kick\" counts. The fetal kick count is the count of any movements that the unborn baby makes such as jabs, punches, rolls, twists and turns. However, fetal kick counts do not include hiccups. If the fetal kick count is not normal, then this could be a sign of fetal distress. Keep in mind that even if the baby’s movements are decreased, you may still go on to have a healthy baby. Fetal kick counts can also help you learn your baby's sleeping and waking cycles, and it is an excellent way for you to bond with your baby before they are born."

      "content": "Know when to start. Doctors recommend that pregnant people should begin to start counting “kicks” during their third trimester, usually around 28 weeks. The baby usually becomes noticeably active between 18 and 25 weeks into the pregnancy. [1] X Research source If this is your first pregnancy, you will not notice the baby kicking until you are closer to 25 weeks. [2] X Research source The baby will be moving, but you will not feel it. For second or third time mothers, babies usually begin to start kicking around 18 weeks. [3] X Research source For high risk pregnancies, doctors recommend that the mother begins documenting fetal kick counts at 26 weeks."

      "title": "Look for patterns.",
      "content": "Look for patterns. At first, it is difficult to distinguish gas and stomach discomfort from the fetal kicks. However, a healthy baby should soon establish a pattern of movements, becoming active during some parts of the day and resting during others. These patterns will soon become recognizable to the mother. [4] X Research source In the third trimester, the baby begins to demonstrate waking and sleeping cycles. When awake, the baby should kick frequently (at least 10 times in two hours). When sleeping, the baby will be still. You should be able to identify patterns of when the baby is asleep and awake from feeling the kicks."

      "content": "Be proactive. Once you have identified fetal kick patterns, monitor them closely. You should perform a fetal kick count once a day after 28 weeks of pregnancy as a way to monitor your baby’s health. [5] X Research source Remember to always track your kick counts in a journal or notebook. For more on this process, see part 2."

      "content": "Don’t panic. If your baby doesn’t kick the first time you perform a fetal kick count, then you may want to call your doctor to have a checkup and make sure everything is okay. While your baby will establish a pattern of movement in the womb, these patterns are not set in stone and are subject to changes on a day-to-day basis. [6] X Research source You can also try to coax some movement out of your baby by eating a meal or drinking something sugary, like a cup of juice. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Know when to seek help. If a discernible pattern does not begin between the 28th and 29th weeks of your pregnancy, you should immediately schedule an appointment with your doctor or OBGYN. Also, if a pattern emerges after 28 weeks, but then suddenly ceases or changes drastically, you will want to call a medical professional as soon as possible to identify any problems or issues with your pregnancy. [8] X Research source The baby may not be kicking for a number of reasons. However, the following medical concerns could be related to a lack of kicking: The baby is not getting enough oxygen. The baby could have shifted to an awkward position, such as into a breech (sideways) position. Changes in position are normal and they may result in decreased fetal movements. The baby has died in the womb."

      "content": "Identify when the baby is most active. Each baby has a time when it is most active, such as after you have eaten a meal, drank a beverage that contained sugar, after being very active, or just during certain times of the day. When you have figured out when your baby is the most active, use that time to chart the fetal kick counts. [10] X Research source In most pregnancies, babies will be the most active between 9pm and 1am, as this is a time when mothers are relaxed enough to notice their baby’s movements."

      "content": "Get comfortable. Find a position that is comfortable for you in which you can relax and still feel your baby's movements pretty well. Keep in mind that you still need to be able to write while in this position. The ideal position is to lay on your side, with your head propped up comfortably with a pillow. This should help you feel the kicks more firmly. You can also rest in a recliner with your feet in the air. Not only is this position comfortable, but you will still be able to feel your baby's kicks. Before you start counting the kicks, write down what week of pregnancy you are in, the day, as well as the starting time of the kicks. [11] X Research source"
