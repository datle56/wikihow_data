      "content": "Remove any plastic moldings from around the windshield. Take care to remove any clips holding the molding in place properly. These clips release many different ways (i.e. pull straight out, remove the middle first, push in from either side, etc.) but damaging them will mean that they have to be replaced. They can range from very cheap, to relatively expensive, and some of them are hard to find. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Analyze the best angle to separate the windshield from the pinch-weld. The pinch-weld is an area at the front of the car where different metal components are welded together. This provides structure and forms a frame for the windshield. In order to remove the windshield you must cut it away from the pinch-weld. This can be done from inside or outside the vehicle with a cold knife or razor."

    {
      "title": "Cut the urethane.",
      "content": "Cut the urethane. The urethane is a very strong, but flexible, polymer based adhesive. If you choose to cut from the outside you might have a problem when the windshield has been placed too close to the pinch-weld. If there is less than 1/8” of urethane then the knife will not have room to drag properly. This causes the glass to break and make a mess. Cutting the windshield out from the inside of the vehicle is the other option. You can use an extended handle razor knife and cut with a repeated dragging motion. Many installers also use power cutters which are faster but do more damage to the metal pinch-weld."

      "content": "Remove the windshield from the car. This should be done with two people. Open the front door on either side of the car and reach one arm in to gently push the glass away from the pinch-weld. Get a hold of the glass from the outside of the car and lift it straight up off of the pinch-weld."

      "content": "Tape off the area around the spot. You will want to cover any areas that were not sanded, and protect the inside of your vehicle using tape and sheets of paper or plastic. This will prevent the primer from getting on anything other than bare metal."

      "content": "Apply the urethane with an electric caulking gun. If you do not have an electric caulking gun they can be purchased at your local hardware store. They range from about forty to three hundred and fifty dollars. The best thing for the new urethane to adhere to is the old urethane. It must be clean and free from dirt, oil or other contaminants. One problem installers have is wind blowing dust onto the pinch-weld before the urethane adhesive has been applied. The job can be done without an electric gun but it is much more difficult to get a consistent bead, making leaks likely."

      "title": "Install the windshield.",
      "content": "Install the windshield. Carefully align the top bottom and sides by sight. Set the windshield on top of the pinch-weld. Some vehicles have mounting block for the bottom of the windshield to rest on, others do not. Be careful not to touch the frit band because the oils and dirt from your skin can contaminate the activated glass and reduce adhesion to the urethane. Some installers tape the windshield once it is in place. This holds it until the urethane dries."
