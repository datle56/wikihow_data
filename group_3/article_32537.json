      "content": "Kneel on your hands and knees. It may help to start in downward facing dog position on a yoga mat. Kneel and bring your big toes together so they're touching. Move your knees apart so they're about hip-distance apart. [2] X Research source Some instructors recommend keeping your knees together to create expansion through the back of the body and add pressure on the abdomen. While you can do this, moving your knees apart will allow you to stretch deeper into the pose and open up your hips and spine. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Make the pose comfortable for stiff joints. The main goal of doing this pose is to relax and focus in comfort. If you find that your joints are stiff, making the pose uncomfortable, try a modification of the pose, such as: Start by sitting cross-legged in easy pose or kneeling with your bottom on a block in hero pose or with your knees hip-width apart. This can reduce the amount of pressure you're putting on your joints. Placing a block underneath your hips while in seated position. Putting a blanket between your thighs and calves. Trying this pose in the evening since your body is stiffer in the morning and loosens up as the day goes on."

      "title": "Increase the stretch of your torso.",
      "content": "Increase the stretch of your torso. While this is mainly a resting pose, you can also do child's pose to stretch the muscles in your torso. To do so, bring your arms out in front of you while lifting your bottom up a little bit. Stretch your arms forward as you bring your shoulder blades back. Keep your arms where they are and sit your bottom back down on your heels or as far back as it will go. [9] X Research source This stretch is also a helpful way to do the pose if you have a larger body or have trouble putting weight on your knees. You could also lift your wrists while keeping your fingertips pressed to the floor while in child’s pose."

      "title": "Rest your forehead on your hands.",
      "content": "Rest your forehead on your hands. If you're having trouble bringing your forehead completely down to the floor, don't overextend yourself. You could pull a muscle. Instead, bring your arms together so that your hands meet in the middle. Ball your hands into fists and rest your forehead on your fists instead of the floor. [10] X Research source If you're still having trouble, stack your fists on top of each other or use a block to further raise your arms off the ground."

      "title": "Use pillows and cushions.",
      "content": "Use pillows and cushions. You can strategically place rolled up towels, small cushions or pillows to support your limbs during deep stretches. For example, you might want to fold a thick blanket under your back thighs and calves if sitting on your ankles is uncomfortable. [11] X Research source [12] X Research source You could also place a pillow under your bottom so that it rests on your ankles. This can help if you feel like you're unbalanced and might fall forward while doing the pose. Or, slide a bolster between your knees so that your torso rests along the spine of the bolster and creates a comfortable resting place for your head."

      "title": "Try a chair modification.",
      "content": "Try a chair modification. You can modify child’s pose using a chair, if desired. Sit in the chair with your legs spread wide apart, or with your knees together.
