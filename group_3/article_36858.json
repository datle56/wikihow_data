      "content": "Yes, you can repair ceramic household items with glue. A cracked ceramic mug, plate, or even tile can be repaired and look almost as good as new if you have all of the pieces. A strong adhesive will dry and cure to form a strong bond that will allow you to continue using the item. So don’t throw out that mug because the handle broke off or there’s a crack in the lip!

      "title": "Super glue is the best glue to use for simple repairs.",
      "content": "Super glue is the best glue to use for simple repairs. While you can use epoxy to repair ceramic, the simplest and best overall choice is super glue. It’s fast, it’s easy, and it’s effective. Choose a quality brand such as Gorilla Super Glue or Krazy Glue. [3] X Research source If you do choose to go with epoxy, choose a quality and dependable brand like JB Weld, which is simple to apply and sets quickly. If you’re repairing ceramic that’s exposed to a lot of water or the outside elements, choose a waterproof version of super glue."

      "content": "Apply super glue to the crack and hold it in place for 1-2 minutes. If there’s a small gap in the crack, press both sides together. Use the applicator tip of the super glue to apply the glue directly into the crack. Wait for about 1-2 minutes to allow the glue to soak into the crack and form a bond. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Wipe away the excess glue before it fully dries.",
      "content": "Wipe away the excess glue before it fully dries. Because the hairline crack is so small, it’s likely that you’ll have some excess glue on the surface of the mug. No worries. As soon as you allow the glue to seep into the crack for a minute or so, take a clean cloth and wipe away any excess glue from the surface so it doesn’t have a chance to fully set.

      "title": "Apply adhesive to the sides of the crack and press the pieces together.",
      "content": "Apply adhesive to the sides of the crack and press the pieces together. You can use either super glue or a 2-part epoxy. If you choose to use epoxy, make sure you mix both parts together according to the instruction on the packaging. Apply the glue to the edges of the crack and then hold the broken pieces together for a few seconds so the form a bond. [6] X Research source The adhesive is not fully dry yet, so don’t immediately use the bowl!"

      "title": "Allow the adhesive to dry and then scrape off the excess.",
      "content": "Allow the adhesive to dry and then scrape off the excess. Wait about 10 minutes for the adhesive to dry and harden. Then, use a metal scraper or a kitchen knife to scrape off any adhesive that was pushed out of the crack so the surface is nice and smooth. [7] X Research source"

      "title": "Clean off the pieces with rubbing alcohol.",
      "content": "Clean off the pieces with rubbing alcohol. Use rubbing alcohol and a clean cloth to wipe down the pottery. Remove any dust or dirt from the surface and scrub off any old adhesive that may be on the surface so the new adhesive can bond more effectively. [8] X Research source"

      "title": "Apply 2-part epoxy to 1 side and hold the pieces together.",
      "content": "Apply 2-part epoxy to 1 side and hold the pieces together. Mix together 2-part epoxy according to the directions on the packaging and then spread a thin layer on 1 side of the chipped pottery. Then, press the broken piece back into place and hold it for about a minute so it bonds. [9] X Research source Epoxy is a better choice for chipped pottery because it will fill in the space more effectively than super glue."

      "content": "Allow the epoxy to cure for an hour and then scrape off the excess. When you press the chipped piece back into place, some of the epoxy may squeeze out between the crack. That’s okay. Allow the epoxy to fully cure and harden and then take a razor blade and scrape off the excess. [10] X Research source"
