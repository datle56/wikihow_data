      "content": "Choose an inconspicuous area like the bend of your elbow. It's fine to put the product somewhere else like the underside of your arm or behind your ear—just pick a place where the product won't get washed off. Wash your skin and dry it before you apply the product to a quarter-sized patch of your skin. [1] X Research source The underside of your jaw is another sensitive spot where you could apply the product, but don't accidentally wash it off when you clean your face."

If you're testing something that you're not supposed to wash off, like moisturizer, just apply it to the test spot and leave it alone. If you're testing a product that you'd normally wash off, wait 5 minutes before you rinse it away.

If you're testing a face mask or product that you're supposed to keep on for a specific amount of time, leave it on for as long as the manufacturer calls for."

      "content": "Repeated exposure can rule out allergic contact dermatitis. A home skin patch test can easily show you if you have an immediate reaction. However, you'll also want to see if you have a reaction when you're consistently exposed to the product. [3] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Dermatology Professional organization made of over 20,000 certified dermatologists Go to source If you react quickly to something in a product, you have irritant contact dermatitis. If you develop a reaction over several days, you have allergic contact dermatitis. Keep in mind that some ingredients like retinol and glycolic acid will irritate your skin with consistent exposure. It takes at least 4 days to determine if you have allergic contact dermatitis, which is why repeated applications are super important. [4] X Research source"

For instance, if you find that certain acne skincare products cause you to break into a rash, you might determine that you're allergic to salicylic acid. Going forward, shop for acne products that don't contain salicylic acid.
