      "title": "Purchase 2 medium-sized onions.",
      "content": "Purchase 2 medium-sized onions. Red onions typically contain the most quercetin. However, all onions have some of the antioxidant and have demonstrated expectorant properties for those with congestion. Therefore, 2 red onions may be preferable, but any 2 medium-sized onions will do. Onions are known to contain quercetin (an antioxidant) and phytochemicals, both of which may help the body by breaking up the mucus in the chest and head. [2] X Research source A. Cavender, Folk medical uses of plant foods in southern Appalachia, United States, Journal of Ethnopharmacology, Volume 108, Issue 1, 3 November 2006, Pages 74-84."
