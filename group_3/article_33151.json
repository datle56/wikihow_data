      "title": "Gather 4 or more people to play.",
      "content": "Gather 4 or more people to play. You’ll need an equal number of players on each team. Split your players into 2 groups: the fugitives and the cops. You can divide people randomly, such as by having them draw their role out of a hat or choose team captains and have them pick their team members 1 at a time. [1] X Research source This game is best for teens and adults as it involves traveling over a long distance and hiding along the way."

      "title": "Choose a point A and point B for the game.",
      "content": "Choose a point A and point B for the game. Fugitive is best played over a walking-friendly area of 2-5 miles, so select a point A and point B that the players can safely travel through. The fugitives, drivers, and chasers will all start at point A and travel towards point B. The first fugitive to reach point B is the winner of the game. [2] X Research source If you’re playing fugitive in your neighborhood, then you might make your backyard the starting point and make a local playground the ending point. You may also want to set some ground rules before the game begins to specify what areas are and are not okay to travel through. Be careful not to play fugitive in areas with a lot of traffic. Choose side roads and quiet streets in residential areas to travel through."

      "title": "Designate drivers and chasers if the cops will pursue fugitives in cars.",
      "content": "Designate drivers and chasers if the cops will pursue fugitives in cars. If you decide to play the game with cars, you’ll also need to designate drivers and chasers. These players will travel in the car looking for fugitives. If they spot a fugitive, the chaser can get out of the car and go after them. If the chaser tags the fugitive, they are out and they will have to get into the car with the driver and chaser. [3] X Research source The cops could also be allowed to use bikes if you don’t want to use cars."
    },
    {
      "title": "Set a time limit before the game begins.",
      "content": "Set a time limit before the game begins. Fugitive can go on for hours, so it may be a good idea to set an official end time for the game. At this point, all players must meet up at the end point. Any fugitives who make it to the end point without being caught by the cops are safe. [5] X Research source For example, if the game starts at 8:00 pm, you might decide to end it at 11:00 pm."

      "title": "Give the fugitives a 5 minute head start if you’re using cars.",
      "content": "Give the fugitives a 5 minute head start if you’re using cars. Once the players are divided into their teams, have the cops close their eyes or turn away. Allow the fugitives a 5 minute head start. The cops can go considerably faster than the fugitives if the cops are using cars. [6] X Research source The cops could also use bikes if you dont want to use cars."

      "title": "Have the cops close their eyes and count to 100 if they will be on foot.",
      "content": "Have the cops close their eyes and count to 100 if they will be on foot. If the cops are not using cars, the fugitives won't need as much of a head start. Have the cops close their eyes and count to 100 before they take off in pursuit of the fugitives. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Send the cops in pursuit of the fugitives. The fugitives can travel towards their destination using any path they like, and this is wise since it will help them to hide from the cops. The cops may pursue the fugitives along any route they like as well. If a cop sees a fugitive, their chaser can get out and go after them. If a chaser tags a fugitive, that person is out of the game and must get into the car or walk along with the cop and chaser. [8] X Research source"

If the car fills up or if the cops want to drop off fugitives as they go, the cops can drop the fugitives off at the end point with the understanding that they are out. [9] X Research source"

      "content": "Avoid trespassing or doing anything else that is illegal while you play. Fugitives are on foot and will need to hide and run from the cops pursuing them in a car. However, it’s important to stay safe and avoid doing anything illegal while you play the game. Don’t trespass or vandalize anything in your quest to reach the end point. [10] X Research source"

      "title": "Wait and watch in areas that you think fugitives might travel through.",
      "content": "Wait and watch in areas that you think fugitives might travel through. This is a great strategy for cops. If you suspect that fugitives may come through an area or that they may be hiding, park your car, turn off the lights, and wait. When you spot a fugitive, your chaser can go after them on foot and take them by surprise. [11] X Research source"

To do this, catch as many fugitives as possible and deliver them to the end point. [12] X Research source You might want to keep a tally of the number of fugitives you have caught."

However, even if you don’t make it to the end point first, arriving without being caught will still mean that you are safe. [13] X Research source Try to find a good hiding place and slowly move towards point B, finding more hiding places as you go. Once you are close enough, run as quickly and as silently as you can and try to make it to point B without getting tagged."
