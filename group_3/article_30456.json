      "title": "Mars in Capricorn is self-disciplined, realistic, and traditional.",
      "content": "Mars in Capricorn is self-disciplined, realistic, and traditional. In astrology, Mars is the planet of aggression and energy—so your Mars sign placement influences your enthusiasm and how you assert yourself. When you have a Mars in Capricorn placement, you assert yourself by steadily and confidently chasing your ambitions with relentless focus. You want power and success, but that’s not your only motivator; you also want to leave behind a legacy that you can be truly proud of. [1] X Research source Capricorn is an earth sign ruled by Saturn, the planet of rules, responsibility, and dedication. Therefore, a Mars in Capricorn sign placement means you’re very responsible. You believe in getting ahead through careful planning and tend to be fairly traditional and level-headed. Astrologers consider Mars to be exalted in Capricorn, meaning Mars’ energy resonates particularly powerfully in Capricorn. This is because Mars’ strength and determination fit well with the qualities of a disciplined, ambitious Capricorn sign—and Mars in Capricorn amplifies the traits of both."

      "title": "Ambitious",
      "content": "Ambitious If you have a Mars in Capricorn sign placement, you tend to have lofty goals—particularly when it comes to your career. Capricorn is one of the most ambitious and successful zodiac signs , so when you’re a Mars in Capricorn, you likely possess Capricorn’s passion and drive to prosper in life. You also look for new ways to improve your skills so you can empower yourself and raise your chances of success. Because Capricorn is a cardinal sign (one of the zodiac’s self-motivated “instigators”), you’re driven by your desire for success. Mars, the planet of energy and action, further fuels this desire. When you have a Mars in Capricorn placement, your ambition may give you tunnel vision sometimes. You may get so focused on your goals that you get a little ruthless, prioritizing your own accomplishments over other people. Make a point to be considerate of others and nurture your relationships so that work doesn’t interfere with them. Keep in mind: it’s more fun to celebrate your success when you’ve got people to do it with you!"

      "title": "Practical",
      "content": "Practical As someone with a Mars in Capricorn placement, you have a very realistic and logical outlook on life. You prefer to remain grounded and focused on what’s achievable rather than get caught up in hopes or daydreams, and you usually won’t consider a possibility unless you’re convinced it can be done. As ambitious as you are, you tend to set practical, doable goals for yourself—which is one of the secrets to your success! Your practicality also gives you a very calculated, strategic mind. To you, fulfilling long-term goals is more important than any short-term gratification, and you’ve likely got a full plan in place on how you’ll meet those goals. Capricorn is an earth sign, which is what influences your sensible, grounded way of thinking when you have a Mars in Capricorn placement."

      "title": "Responsible",
      "content": "Responsible You have a strong sense of duty and responsibility if you have a Mars in Capricorn placement. You take your commitments very seriously and tend to be very disciplined in your daily life. You're all about following the rules—and are likely very tidy and organized as well. Your sense of responsibility makes you great at keeping track of things (from projects to important passwords), and you’re generally a very dependable person. [2] X Research source Capricorn’s ruling planet, Saturn (the planet of responsibility and rules), is the source of your dutiful, responsible nature when you have a Mars in Capricorn placement. However, your innate sense of responsibility can also make you be a little hard on yourself at times (and other people, too). You set high expectations, but it’s important to remember that it’s okay to make mistakes. If you have a Mars in Capricorn placement, try not to be too hard on yourself. Nobody expects you to be perfect, so learn to reign in your perfectionist tendencies !"

      "content": "Cool-headed It’s not easy to get under your skin when you have Mars in Capricorn on your star chart. You’re calm, measured, and patient—not because you’re easygoing, but because you have lots of self-control. You’re not one to lash out when you get angry (or be bitter for a long time after). In your mind, the best revenge is being successful and showing the other person just how powerful you really are. [3] X Research source The planet Mars influences aggression and anger in astrology—so, when you’re a Mars in Capricorn, you express anger in a cool, collected way."

      "title": "Controlling",
      "content": "Controlling If you have a Mars in Capricorn sign placement, you may be stubborn and have a deep-seated need to be in control. Capricorn tends to be afraid of the chaos that might ensue from “letting go,” so as a Mars in Capricorn, you might feel the need to be in control of yourself at all times. This is because you want to have the power to choose your own path and set your own goals—so, in some ways, your desire for success is a form of self-protection. You also have a strong sense of independence. You don’t like working by other people’s rules and expectations, so it may feel easier for you to simply go it alone instead. As a Mars in Capricorn, you tend to be cautious and not much of a risk-taker. However, you’re most comfortable taking risks when it’s entirely your decision; you trust your own mind and logic more than anyone else’s. There’s absolutely nothing wrong with wanting to be in control of your life and choices, but remember that it’s also okay to ask for help or be open-minded to outside input—especially when you’re collaborating on something."

      "content": "Mars in Capricorn values talented and supportive partners. When it comes to choosing partners, you’re attracted to talented, accomplished partners who have their own ambitions in life but will also support and encourage you as you pursue your ambitions.

The earth signs include Virgo, Taurus, and, naturally, Capricorn.

      "title": "A Mars in Capricorn transit influences you to be sensible and work hard.",
      "content": "A Mars in Capricorn transit influences you to be sensible and work hard. As Mars moves into Capricorn during its orbit, you may find yourself feeling more grounded and pragmatic. This transit motivates you to buckle down, make plans, and set new goals for yourself, particularly ones related to your career. It may also give you a sense of purpose and encourage you to reevaluate old goals so you can find a more efficient alternative. Because Mars is the planet of action and Capricorn influences your sense of responsibility, you may also feel more on top of your obligations during a Mars in Capricorn transit. Since Capricorn is a cardinal sign—an “initiator”—the Mars in Capricorn transit is the perfect time to start a new project (or commit to finishing something you already began). Both the planet Mars and the Capricorn sign can be a little insensitive at times, with Mars inspiring boldness and Capricorn fueling ambition. So, remember to have compassion for the people around you while Mars transits Capricorn!"
