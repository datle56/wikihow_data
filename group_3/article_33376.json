      "content": "Shut the Box is a classic pub game where players roll a pair of dice and lower tiles on the game tray that correspond with the numbers they roll. The goal of the game is to lower as many tiles as possible on a single turn before running out of options. Any tiles left upright at the end of a player’s turn are added to their score. The player with the lowest score wins! [2] X Research source Shut the Box is usually played with 2-4 players, but you can also play solo. Just compete against your lowest score. [3] X Research source If you don’t own a Shut the Box tray, you can still play with a deck of cards and 2 dice. Make a row of 10 cards, Ace through 10, to represent the tiles. Instead of lowering tiles, flip the cards over to indicate they’ve been “lowered.”"

      "content": "On a player’s turn, they throw the dice into the game tray and add up the total of their roll. They then lower 1 or more tiles that equal the total they rolled. For example, if a player rolled a 4 and a 3, their total is 7. Therefore, they could choose to lower one of the following tile combinations: 7 4 & 3 5 & 2 6 & 1 4, 2, & 1"

      "content": "After lowering the tile(s), the player continues to roll the dice and lower tiles until they reach the point where no tiles correspond with the total they roll. For example, if the total of a player’s roll is 6 and only the 7 and 2 tiles remain upright, they’re unable to lower any tiles and their turn is over. Once a player’s turn is over, the next player starts their turn with all of the tiles in the upright position. [4] X Research source This continues until each player has taken one turn. Once the 7 and higher tiles have all been lowered, players may choose to roll with 1 die instead of 2. If a player manages to lower all of the tiles on their turn, they “shut the box” and automatically win the game!"
