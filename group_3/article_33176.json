      "content": "Stop using a pick to play. If you have nails that are longer than a pick, don’t use one to strum your guitar. Your nails will get in the way of the pick and could cause you to hit other strings, or even damage your nails. You can try holding the pick like a pencil so that your nails don’t get in the way of it, but this can be awkward and might mess up your sound."

      "content": "Fingerpick the guitar strings. Instead of strumming with long nails, it might be easier to fingerpick the strings of your guitar.

      "content": "Slope your fingernails for a warm sound. Another nail shape to use for a classical guitar is a sloped nail.

      "content": "Shape your fingernails in a point so that they resemble a pick. If your nails are longer than a guitar pick, you can file them into points that act like one. Use a nail file to file your nails into a pointed shape in the middle. Make sure the slopes are even on each side. You can file all of the nails on your strumming hand like this, or just your pointer finger and thumb. [4] X Research source"

You can cut the nails on your fret hand short and keep the nails on your strumming hand long. This will make your hands uneven, but it is much easier to hold chords with short nails."
