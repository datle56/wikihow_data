Next, retract the operation rod and inspect the chamber visually (look to see it is empty) and physically (put a finger into the chamber to check it is empty). It is usually a good idea to lock the bolt back if possible, to show at a distance that it is empty. Not all rifles are able to do this. AK/Kalashnikov rifles for instance cannot, though AR/AR15/M16-style ones can. [4] X Research source"

If you are pulling the trigger with your right hand the left side of the butt/stock should be firmly pressed against your right cheek below the cheekbone (this is called a gun mold).

Most legal versions of assault rifles in the United States are semi-automatic, so they only fire once each time the trigger is squeezed, but by holding the rifle and rapidly squeezing and releasing the trigger, you may be able to achieve a faster rate of fire."

      "content": "Take the gun down and clean it after it has cooled down. Whenever possible, always clean the barrel by inserting the cleaning rod into the breach (back) of the barrel, not the muzzle (front). Depending on how the gas system is designed to operate, you may or may not need to clean the gas tube. Check for cleaning instructions specific to you rifle before you start, and beware small pins and springs. A magnet can help to keep track of these small parts, which are more common on modern AR designs."
