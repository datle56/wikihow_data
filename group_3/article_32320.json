It's recommended to use an awakened race to take advantage of their boosted stats. To avoid accidentally killing other players, make sure all players are marines or allied pirates. The best fruits to use are Buddha, Dough, Ice, or Dark. The best swords to use are the Spikey Trident or Cursed Dual Katana . The best fighting styles to use are Godhuman or Sharkman Karate. Use ranged attacks and keep your distance, unless you're using the Buddha fruit."

It's recommended to summon the Dough King on a private server, as trolls/cheaters will sometimes summon the Cake Prince instead of the Dough King before the Sweet Chalice user can talk to drip_mama. Once you have the Sweet Chalice, stay in a safe zone, or you might get killed by bounty hunters."
