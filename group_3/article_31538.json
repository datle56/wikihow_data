For example, if you lose your job, you’ll have the chance to apply for a different one, and it may even be better than the one you had before. People usually use this phrase to comfort themselves after they experience a setback, or to encourage others when they’re in tough situations. [1] X Research source “I was sad when I didn’t get into my dream college, but maybe another school will be a better fit for me.

      "content": "The phrase comes from a quote by Alexander Graham Bell. Bell (1847-1922) is famous for being the inventor of the telephone. [2] X Research source The full quote reads: “When one door closes another door opens; but we so often look so long and so regretfully upon the closed door, that we do not see the ones which open for us.” The longer quote adds another layer of meaning to the phrase. It suggests that, when we’re too focused on the thing we lost (the closed door), we might not notice a new opportunity that comes up. The message seems to be that it’s important to let go and move on after a setback, so that you’re ready when exciting new opportunities come your way."
