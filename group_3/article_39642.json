      "content": "You get a distinct feeling your twin flame is there with you. Sometimes the strongest sign is one you can’t explain.

That gut feeling is usually right, and is a sure sign that your twin flame is thinking about you. [1] X Research source That gut feeling is also sometimes a sign that your twin flame has feelings of deep love for you. Love itself is often a gut feeling, after all."

If you haven’t met your twin flame yet, this feeling may manifest as the distinct notion that you just did something twice. It’s not quite déjà vu, but rather a doubling or an intensification of an act."
