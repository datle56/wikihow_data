      "content": "Pick a side of the ball to polish after 5 overs. Choose one side of the ball to keep polished and shiny. Leave the other side of the ball alone so that it develops wear and tear throughout the rest of the match. If 1 side has visible wear on it after 5 overs, polish the opposite side.

      "content": "Gather sweat or saliva from your body. Wipe the sweat off your skin from your forehead, arms, and neck. You can also collect sweat from your underarms or the small of your back to wet your hands. Occasionally lick your fingers to use as moisture for polishing the ball. It’s illegal in the game to use any foreign substance to polish the ball. This includes any residual sunscreen you may be wearing. Umpires and other players will keep an eye out for this. If you are caught using an illegal substance to polish the ball, you’ll be fined and banned from the match."

      "title": "Polish 1 side of the ball with your fingers.",
      "content": "Polish 1 side of the ball with your fingers. After you collect sweat or saliva on your hands, rub the leather on 1 side. Work the moisture across the whole side, including the area right next to the stitches in the middle of the ball. Shining only part of the side will result in a less polished ball and will not reverse swing as effectively."

      "title": "Shine the side of the ball on your pants.",
      "content": "Shine the side of the ball on your pants. Use the area where your leg meets your groin. Bend your leg slightly to make a crease in your pants. Rub the shiny side of the ball against your pants until it’s dry. It’s common to see red stains on bowlers’ pants after they polish a ball."

      "content": "Start bowling a reverse swing after the ball has gone through 25-30 overs. Continue to polish 1 side of the ball throughout the match and let the other side develop wear and tear. The leather on the ball will look distinctly different on each side of the stitches.

      "content": "Hold the ball with the seams pointing toward the slips fielder. The slips fielder stands directly behind the wicketkeeper. Line the stitches up so they are directed towards the first slip. This shouldn’t look any different from a regular pitch to the batsman.

      "content": "Point the rough side of the ball toward the batsman. The shiny side will face in the opposite direction. The ball will swing to the direction that the shiny side is facing even though the batsman will expect it to swing towards the rough side. [6] X Research source Alternatively, point the shiny side of the ball towards the batsman for the ball to swing away from them."
