You can't schedule every interruption, or predict how many times the phone will ring in an afternoon, but you may be able to select your tasks and have in mind a general sequence of events to complete them but avoid needless repetition or redundancy. [5] X Research source Start longer or more involved tasks first. Fill in the gaps with shorter, well-defined, or self-contained tasks. Think about whether there are resources to manage and distribute, other than your time and attention. If you are baking multiple dishes, each one will need time in the oven. Can you put them all in together, or must they go in some sequence?"

      "title": "Work ahead.",
      "content": "Work ahead. If you know there will be a big rush in the afternoon, start early to set up and prepare. If you've ever seen restaurant staff wrapping flatware in napkins at 3pm, you've seen a good example of working ahead in action."

      "content": "Work on one thing at a time, but alternate. Jugglers may have many objects in the air, but they usually manipulate only one at a time. In terms of tasks, alternating rapidly may mean figuring out ways to switch between tasks cleanly. Perhaps that means identifying or even building in times when a task does not need your direct attention (such as when laundry is in the washing machine or a casserole is in the oven). That may also mean setting a timer or alarm, or making a mental or written note to remind yourself to pay attention to a task again when the time comes."

If you're multitasking to be more efficient, don't spend time doing extra things. The exception is a background activity to help pass the time if a primary task is dull, mechanical, or routine. For instance, if listening to the radio or an audio book helps with the tedium of painting a wall, go for it. [8] X Research source"

When you do pause, pause consciously and do what you need to, to remind yourself to resume. When possible, pause at natural pause points. This may be the end of a page, or the beginning of a waiting cycle."
