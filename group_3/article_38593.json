For example, if you want to select everything in a Word document (including images and other objects), you can use this keyboard shortcut.

This tool works the same as using the Control + A keyboard shortcut, but you can access it through a menu instead. For example, let's say you're viewing a text file in Notepad. You can click the Edit menu and choose Select all to select all characters in the text file at once. Another example is in iTunes—if you want to select all songs currently displayed in the window, click the Edit menu and choose Select all . If Select all is greyed out, you can't use select all on the current page or window."

If you're in a File Explorer window (e.g., browsing your documents or viewing the This PC folder), you can use the menu items in the upper-left side of the window to select all. Open the folder containing the files you want to select. Click the Home tab at in the upper-left corner of the window.

This will typically select everything on the page, including text, photos, and other objects. Or, if you're browsing files, it will select every file in the window or panel. If you don't have a right mouse button, tap two fingers together on your mouse's trackpad to bring up the menu."

For example, if you want to select everything inside of your Pages document, including images and objects, you can use this keyboard shortcut. Here's how to use it: Click the window or page that you want to select. Press Command and A at the same time. This will highlight everything that can be selected."

It works the same as pressing Command + A , except you'll access it through a menu, not a keyboard shortcut. For example, let's say you're viewing a list of files in a Finder window.

This will work when composing a message in Messages or Mail, typing in the Notes app, into browser forms, and in virtually any other app that allows typing. Here's how: Double-tap the first word you want to select. This highlights the word and places vertical selection bars on either side. Drag the selection bar on the right down and to the right until all of the text is selected. Or, to quickly select all text in a paragraph, just triple-tap the first word.

      "content": "Select everything in a document or on a website. This is similar to selecting text you've typed, but the steps are a little different. First, you'll need to be using an app that has selectable text and/or images—emails, websites with text (as long as the text is actual text and not images), and the Amazon app all allow you to select text. Here's how to select all text in these types of apps: Tap and hold the first word you want to select. Lift your finger when the word is highlighted and you see vertical selection bars on either side of the word. Drag the rightmost vertical selection bar down and to the right until you've highlighted everything on the page. Most social media apps won't allow you to select all text. If the text you're trying to select is actually an image (and it can be hard to tell), you usually won't be able to select it."
