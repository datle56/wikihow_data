      "content": "Play the game with 2–8 players who are 8 and older. Unstable Unicorns plays best when you have more players because you get to use all of the cards in the deck. Because there are a lot of cards with unique powers and effects, the game might be confusing for children who are any younger than 8 years old. If you have younger kids, try playing Unstable Unicorns for Kids with anyone 6 or older. Unstable Unicorn expansions add new cards to the game, but some of them may be inappropriate for children. If you’re looking for a more adult version of the game for players who are over 18, try out Unstable Unicorns NSFW instead."

It doesn’t matter which Baby Unicorn card each player uses since they all have the same effect, so let everyone choose their favorite. Place the Baby Unicorn card face-up along with your reference card in front of you. [1] X Research source The area in front of each player is called their Stable and it’s where you play and keep cards throughout the game. Place the rest of the Baby Unicorn cards in a face-up stack in the middle of the table. The stack is known as the Nursery . If you’re playing with 2 players , find the “Neigh” cards with a red exclamation point in the top-left corner, and give one to each player."

Then, deal cards to all of the players face-down. Each player can look at their own hand of cards, but keep them secret from everyone else. Set the rest of the cards face-down in the middle of the table to create the deck . Leave a little space next to the deck so you have room for a discard pile as well. If you’re playing with 2 players , remove the following cards from the game before shuffling the deck: All Basic Unicorns Queen Bee Unicorn Seductive Unicorn Rainbow Unicorn Mother Goose Unicorn Necromancer Unicorn Nanny Cam Sadistic Ritual Slowdown Yay!"

When a played card has the phrase, “If this card is in your Stable at the beginning of your turn…” then perform the effects listed on the card. [2] X Research source An effect might be playing a Unicorn from your hand, drawing extra cards, or stealing cards from another player. Card effects that have the word “may” are optional. Otherwise, the effect is mandatory. If you have multiple cards with abilities that trigger at the beginning of your turn, their effects happen all at the same time and you can choose the order to do them. If a card tells you to end your turn after activating it, you can still use the effects from other cards in your Stable."

Each player starts with 1 Baby Unicorn in their Stable, but Baby Unicorn cards never go directly into your hand. Instead, card effects will let you move a Baby Unicorn from the Nursery to your Stable. Basic Unicorns have an indigo icon. Basic Unicorns don’t have any special effects when you play them, but they count towards the number of cards you need to win. Magical Unicorns have a light blue icon and extra effects that trigger when you play them or at the beginning of your turn. For example, the Rainbow Unicorn allows you to play an additional Basic Unicorn from your hand."

If the deck runs out of cards, it automatically ends the game. Whoever had the most Unicorn cards is the winner.
