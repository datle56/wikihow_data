      "title": "Stay inside the car if possible.",
      "content": "Stay inside the car if possible. Unless your car is on fire, it’s very important to stay inside your car once a power line falls. When a power line falls on your car, it often charges the metal parts of the car with electrical current, meaning that if you attempt to exit as you normally do, you will be electrocuted. After the line falls, look around the inside of your car and out the windows. If you don’t see flames or smoke, you aren’t in any immediate danger. The safest thing you can do is to stay inside. If you see flames and smoke, refer to Method 2 for instructions on safely evacuating the car. If there are other passengers in the car, communicate with them that the safest thing to do is to stay inside the car. Even one person exiting the car incorrectly could put you all in danger of electrocution."

      "title": "Don’t touch the inside of the car.",
      "content": "Don’t touch the inside of the car. Sit still in your car with your hands in your lap. Take extra care not to touch the frame of your car, which is very possibly charged with electrical current. As long as you stay still and don’t touch the frame of your car, you are safe inside your car."

      "title": "Call 911.",
      "content": "Call 911. Use your cell phone to call 911. Give them your address, and tell that that a power line fell on your car. They will likely give you some advice such as staying inside the car, but if they give you specific pieces of advice make sure to follow them. [1] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Warn people not to touch the car or power line.",
      "content": "Warn people not to touch the car or power line. If you notice cars coming behind you or approaching the power line from the opposite lane, honk your horn to signal to them that they should not get near the line. If anyone gets out of their car to investigate or try to help you, shout over to them that they should not touch your car or get anywhere near the fallen power line. If you don’t have your cell phone on you and weren’t able to dial 911, ask anyone who approaches if they will call 911 for you. Do not have them hand you the phone; instead, tell them to call 911, explain the situation, and provide the address of the downed line."

      "title": "Follow the police’s directions.",
      "content": "Follow the police’s directions. Once the dispatchers arrive to the scene, they will approach the car and possibly ask questions or give you instructions. Follow whatever advice they give you, as they will be able to assess your individual situation. Only exit the car after they tell you that the power to the line is out and grounded, and it is safe to get out of your vehicle. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Make absolutely sure the car is on fire.",
      "content": "Make absolutely sure the car is on fire. Evacuating your car is risky, so you want to be 100% sure that your car is on fire before exiting. If you see smoke but no flames, watch the smoke to make sure that it isn’t exhaust coming from your car. Smoke is thick and won’t dissipate quickly, whereas exhaust will fade into the air. If you see flames, your car is definitely on fire and you should evacuate as quickly and carefully as you can."

      "title": "Open the door.",
      "content": "Open the door. Once you see that your car is on fire, it’s important to exit as quickly as you can. Open the latch of the door and push it open, being careful to only touch the plastic latch and not the frame of the door or car. [3] X Research source The metal frame of the car is likely charged with electricity by the power line, so it’s important to have as little contact with your car as possible in order to avoid getting electrocuted."

      "content": "Bring your legs together and cross your arms. After you open the door to the car, don’t step out as you normally would. Instead, hold your legs together and bring them slightly inward towards your body. Rotate your body, making sure to not let your feet or any other part of your body touch the frame of the car, so that you are angled to jump out of the car. Cross your arms over your body to make yourself as small and compact as possible."

      "content": "Jump out of the car. Still keeping your legs together, jump carefully out of the car and land on both of your feet at the same time. Keeping your legs together so that your feet touch the ground at the same time greatly reduces your chances of getting shocked. Jump, don’t slide, out of the car. Your body should be in the air, not sitting in the car, when your feet touch the ground."

Instead of walking and lifting up one foot at a time, shuffle from the car, keeping both your feet on the ground at all times about 6 inches (15 cm) apart. Alternatively, you could also hop away from your car. [4] X Research source You may feel silly, but shuffling or hopping may save you from getting shocked. If you choose to hop from the car, make sure that both of your feet hit the ground at the same time."

Tell them your exact location, and let them know that a power line has fallen onto your car and that your car has caught fire. When the dispatchers arrive, tell them what is going on and follow their safety advice. Warn other approaching cars what has happened, and tell them not to approach or touch the car or the power line. Shout over to them if they are within 50 feet (15.2 m) of the power line or car."

Stay in your car and try not to touch the frame of the car or any metal parts of your car, since they can be charged with electricity. I'm calling 911 right now, so help will be here soon. As long as you stay in your car, you'll be fine!\" If their car is on fire, say, \"Your car is on fire, so you need to get out quickly and carefully! Turn slowly toward the door of your car without touching the frame of the car. Open the door handle without touching any other part of the door.

[8] X Research source If the power line fell on your car, you will likely will have to call a towing company or mechanic to get your car taken away and fixed unless it is only superficially damaged."
