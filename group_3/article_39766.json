      "content": "Stand in front of your seat as close as you can. By starting out close to the chair, you will have less work to do and are much less likely to expose yourself or miss your mark and fall. At most formal functions, it is customary for a gentleman to help you be seated. He will pull out your chair, wait for you to stand in front of it, and then nudge the chair forward to touch the back of your legs. This is sometimes done by your date, a waiter, or another man seated nearby."

      "content": "Smooth your skirt under you. If you are wearing a skirt or dress, it may have become rumpled while you sat down. Sitting will also have raised its hemline. If you don't want your skirt looking rumpled or shorter than it actually is, smooth it down gently with your hands."

      "content": "Decide how to place your feet. You have two main options for your feet: flat on the ground or crossed at the ankles.

      "title": "Ease into your chair with your knees together.",
      "content": "Ease into your chair with your knees together. Keep your torso straight without leaning forward. While you will eventually cross your legs, the act of sitting down is identical to the one used for maintaining traditional ladylike posture.

      "content": "Move your right leg to the left. Begin by raising your right thigh slightly. Then, place your right calf in front of your left. Be sure to keep your thighs together.

      "title": "Switch legs gracefully if necessary.",
      "content": "Switch legs gracefully if necessary. At some point while sitting, you may want to switch positions so that the opposite leg crosses over the other. This can be done if you are quick and graceful enough but should be avoided if you are wearing a particularly short skirt. Simply uncross your legs so that they are in the same position they were in right after you first sat down. Then, simply move the chosen leg over the other to return to a crossed position. Remember to make sure your hands are in your lap while uncrossing and recrossing your legs."
