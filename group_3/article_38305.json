      "title": "Mention that you bumped into one of his (or your) exes.",
      "content": "Mention that you bumped into one of his (or your) exes. Start off your text really innocently, saying that you’re “at the grocery store” or “at the gas station.” Then, drop the bomb that you’ve bumped into one of his exes (or one of yours—whichever you think would spook him more). Explain that you’re having a great conversation, and see how he reacts. “Just bumped into Kelsey at the corner store! You’ll never guess what we’re talking about 😏😏” “Guess who I ran into at the grocery store! Jordan says hi, btw 😉” “Just bumped into Collin on my way out of work…we talked for like 20 minutes 😜”"

      "title": "Challenge him to do something crazy to prove his love.",
      "content": "Challenge him to do something crazy to prove his love. How much does your BF truly love you? A playful, high-stakes test will help you see exactly what your man is willing to do for love. “You, me, matching tattoos? Made an appointment for us at 8 💕” “Dan said that you weren’t brave enough to go sky-diving, so I made a bet to prove him wrong. I scheduled a sky-diving session for you this weekend to settle the score! 😝” “I read this story about a couple who sewed themselves together so they can be connected forever. Wanna give it a try?”"

      "title": "Make him think that you’re both in really big trouble.",
      "content": "Make him think that you’re both in really big trouble. From pregnancy scares to parental freakouts, there’s no shortage of ways you can get your man’s heart pounding over text. Just remember—the more dramatic the message, the bigger the chance it could backfire! “Guess who’s going to be a dad? 👶” (For bonus points, send a fake, grainy ultrasound picture to “prove” your story) “My dad found the condoms you left in my room 😰” “My mom read the texts you sent me last night…😫”"

    {
      "title": "Accuse of him of lying about something.",
      "content": "Accuse of him of lying about something. Start off your text on a really dramatic note—something like “OMG, I can’t believe you’ve been lying to me this entire time” is a great example. Then, see if he rushes to defend his honor. “I can’t believe you lied to me!! Steve just texted me this picture…😒” “OMG did you really think you could hide this from me?? 😡” In some cases, your fake accusation might inspire your BF to confess to something very real. You could also flip things around by sending him an “I haven’t been totally honest with you…” text. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Share a fake, dramatic family announcement.",
      "content": "Share a fake, dramatic family announcement. The bigger, the better! Tell your boyfriend that you’re leaving the country with your parents, or that you have to enter witness protection right away. To really amp up the scare value, try to rope him into this fake scheme, too. “Babe, I have some big news…my family is moving to Nepal next month. There’s enough room for you to stay with us in our apartment, though! 😍” (This type of message is especially effective if your BF hates traveling) “There’s no time to explain—my family and I are being put in witness protection at the end of the week. You can come with us, but you have to decide now.”"

      "content": "Ask him for urgent help with a made-up, catastrophic problem. From kidnapping plots to fake home invasions, there are plenty of ways you can get his adrenaline racing with a single message. Just remember—the higher the stakes are in your message, the less likely your BF is to forgive you when the ruse is revealed. “The septic tank in our backyard just exploded. My dad says we need all hands on deck for this—can you be here in 15? 💩” “Babe, help!!! I just checked our bank account balance and it says we only have $5…” “Help!! Two men just stuffed me in the trunk of their car and are asking for $10,000 😱”"

Use his fear to your advantage as you report a seriously gross discovery you just “made.” Feel free to mention other topics that might make him squeamish, too. “Found a spider crawling over your pillow…should I leave it there? 🤔🕷” “There may or may not be 1,000 ants marching through our bathroom right now…🐜” “This dude barfed all over the subway 🤢 Wanna see?”"

As soon as your boyfriend reads and reacts to the text, let him know that you’re totally joking and that nothing crazy, terrible, or otherwise extreme has happened. “Totally joking!! Wish I could see your face right now 🤣” “Just kidding!! Did I scare you? 😏” “I’m joking, btw. Did you believe me? 😂”"

Explain that you won’t send those types of texts again, and ask him what types of jokes and/or pranks he would prefer. The “why-because-and” formula is a pretty foolproof formula for a great apology. Explain why you’re apologizing to begin with, describe the reason (or the because ) that you feel bad. Then, use and to explain how you’ll do better in the future.

      "content": "Wait until your boyfriend is in a happy, playful mood. This is pretty self-explanatory, but your BF probably won’t take any kind of text prank well if he’s in a bad headspace. Wait until he’s feeling pretty relaxed and care-free before sending anything over. For example, your BF probably isn’t in the mood for a scary prank when he’s cramming for a big test."

In those cases, sending him a gory picture from a horror movie or pretending to sign him up for sky-diving definitely won’t go over well. Remember—at the end of the day, your prank should be all in good fun."
