      "content": "Smell to test the ripeness. Most of the usual signs of ripe fruit don't mean much on a pineapple. Sniff the base of the pineapple instead: a strong scent means the pineapple is ripe. If you can barely smell it, it's probably not. Cold pineapples never smell strong, so leave them at room temperature for a while before you try this. [1] X Research source A yellow-skinned pineapple is a safer choice than a green one, but this isn't a perfect test. Some pineapples are ripe when completely green. [2] X Research source Others have golden or red skins, but are still hard and unpleasant to eat."

      "content": "Expect the pineapple to soften, but not sweeten. Pineapples do not ripen properly after they are picked. On your kitchen counter, the pineapple will become softer and juicier, but it will not become sweet. All of a pineapple's sugar comes from the starches in the stem of the plant. Once that source is cut off, the pineapple cannot make more sugar on its own. [3] X Research source Green pineapples will usually change color as well. It's possible that the pineapple will become even more acidic if stored too long."

      "content": "Prop it upside down (optional). If the pineapple does have a little starch left to convert to sugar, this will be in the base of the fruit. In theory, the sugar might spread better if you keep the pineapple upside down. In practice, the effect is hard to notice, but it might be worth a try. [4] X Research source The skin color also travels from the base upward, although this isn't relevant to the ripeness after picking. If it's difficult to prop up your pineapple, twist off the top and place the exposed end on a damp paper towel. [5] X Research source"

[6] X Research source If the pineapple was picked unripe, it will still be unpleasant to eat. Keep reading to find out how to improve the taste of an unripe pineapple. If you're not ready to eat the pineapple yet, move it to the fridge for another 2â€“4 days."

[7] X Trustworthy Source Science Direct Online archive of peer-reviewed research on scientific, technical and medical topics Go to source That said, most pineapples sold commercially should be at least partially ripe, even if they look green. Even ripe pineapple can hurt your mouth or cause it to bleed. The techniques below will help prevent this as well."

Try this if raw pineapple hurts your mouth: Add pineapple chunks to a saucepan along with all juice collected while cutting. Add enough water to cover. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce to a simmer and heat for 10 minutes. Drain and let cool."
