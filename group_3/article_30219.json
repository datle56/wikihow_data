      "content": "Ask him to use cologne, but sparingly. Smelling good can go a long way toward making someone attractive. Help him pick out a new cologne, but make sure he knows not to overdue the amount he uses. One or two sprays is plenty. [4] X Research source When you're talking about this with him, you can say something like \"I was thinking you could maybe try a new cologne. You've been wearing the same one for a long time and something new could be good!\" To tactfully suggest he not wear as much cologne you could say something like \"Have you ever noticed how some people wear so much cologne or perfume? Why don't people know that one or two sprays is enough?\" This way he gets the information without becoming embarrassed."

      "content": "Get him a manicure. Most guys think that manicures are for women, but that’s not true. Manicuring your nails is just about keeping them trimmed and neat. Having nice looking hands is an easy way to look more attractive. You can take him to a salon for a manicure or, if he’s leery about getting his nails done in public, you offer to do them for him at home (or ask one of your friends to do them for him). You should also encourage him to get a pedicure, particularly if he likes to wear sandals during warm weather."

Try taking him to an actual salon to talk with a stylist, who can recommend the best cut for his face shape. Encourage him to bring pictures of haircuts that he likes to his salon appointment. He should also be open to the idea of using hair products if necessary for his hairstyle. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Help him pick out clothes that fit. Well-tailored clothing that is not too baggy or too big can make a huge difference in how attractive someone looks. Wearing well-tailored clothes also makes it clear that he pays attention to his appearance. [7] X Research source The shoulder seam of his shirts should sit at his shoulder joint – the part of his shoulder where it begins to roll down to his upper arm. Dress shirts fit well if you can slip two fingers inside the collar comfortably and if the cuffs of the shirt don’t pass his wrists. Pants should sit as his natural waist, about three finger-widths below his belly button. The legs of his pants should sit at the top of his shoes, not cover them."

      "content": "Encourage him to incorporate more fruits and veggies in his diet. A lot of guys tend to favor a meat-and-potatoes approach to cooking and eating. This kind of heavy food can not only make your guy gain weight, but it can actually make him feel bad, too. Getting more fruits and veggies into his diet can improve his overall health. [9] X Research source An easy way to get him to eat more fruit and veggies is by encouraging him to eat fruit for breakfast - an apple or banana is easy to grab and gets more fruit into his diet. He can also double the amount of veggies he already eats. If a recipe calls for a certain amount or number of vegetables, encourage him to double the amount the recipe calls for. This way he's not really changing his eating habits, but he's still getting more fruits and veggies."

Encouraging your guy to add some lean protein into his diet can make him look and feel better. [10] X Research source A really easy way to incorporate lean proteins into his diet is just by substituting leaner options for the protein he already eats. If he eats a lot of steak, suggest he use chicken breast instead in some of his recipes. Ground turkey is a great substitution for ground chuck in burgers and tacos, and ground chicken makes great meatballs."
