      "title": "Pick a partner.",
      "content": "Pick a partner. It should be someone you've already flirted with (and who has flirted back). If you try to play footsie with someone who is not interested in you, they may avoid playing along or tell you to stop. The person should be sitting close to you. It is ideal if the person is sitting across from you. Try to get an idea of how the person is feeling about you and feeling in general before initiating contact. If the person is smiling at you and acting flirtatiously, then it is probably okay to initiate contact with this person. If the person is not responsive to you in conversation, then it is not the best idea to play footsie with them."

      "title": "Be discreet.",
      "content": "Be discreet. Footsie is no fun if everyone knows what you're doing. It is best if you are at a table that has a long tablecloth. Make sure you can reach the other person's feet without tripping over the toes of unwanted spectators. Then, quietly slip one of your shoes off (using your other foot to slide the shoe off if necessary). It’s easier to play footsie if you’re wearing shoes that can be easily slipped off, like ballerina flats or loafers. Shoes that tie, like boots or sneakers, will be more difficult to discreetly remove."

    {
      "title": "Initiate contact.",
      "content": "Initiate contact. Tap or push the other person's foot lightly and playfully, then pull away. Do it just once and see the reaction. Stop if they pull their feet quickly out of reach. If they look around and says \"Who just pushed my foot?\" in an annoyed or upset tone, then apologize for the mistake and do not continue. In the best case scenario, though, they will be receptive. In that case, you should tap them more slowly and linger a bit. Then, pull away and wait for him or her to come after your foot. If they don't notice/looks confused, make a subtle \"above the table\" contact. Give a little wink, or give a cute, playful, or gentle smile. Try not to make the smile apologetic, though. They'll think it was an accident."

      "title": "Massage their foot with your foot.",
      "content": "Massage their foot with your foot. Intertwine your foot with your partner’s foot. You can intertwine your toes if neither party is wearing socks. Use the ball of your foot to massage the sole of their foot. Then, move your foot from the foot to massage their ankle."
    },
    {
      "title": "Run your foot around their calf and ankle.",
      "content": "Run your foot around their calf and ankle. Footsie should be a gentle and playful way of flirting. Try lightly running run foot up to the other person's calf and knee, then move back down toward their feet. Massage their ankle with the sole of your foot, or lock ankles (twist your ankle around theirs). Make eye contact and smile . At this point, the person should be aware of what you’re doing and at least partially returning the actions."
    },
    {
      "title": "Move up their legs.",
      "content": "Move up their legs. If things are going well, begin to move your foot up from their ankles/calves to their thigh. Use your foot to massage their inner thighs. This is a more intimate step than playing footsie with their feet, so make sure that the other person does not seem uncomfortable. Move your foot back down to their ankles and feet after a moment. The person make jerk away or change facial expressions suddenly if they feel uncomfortable with having their thighs touched."

    {
      "title": "Make sure your feet are clean.",
      "content": "Make sure your feet are clean. It is important that your feet are clean when you begin to play footsie. A foul odor or grime can quickly ruin the mood. Make sure that you have showered not too long before playing footsie. If you are concerned about your feet, keep your socks on. If you are unsure that your feet are clean enough, excuse yourself to the bathroom to check. You can quickly clean them in the bathroom if necessary. It is helpful to keep a small bottle of lotion with you."

    {
      "title": "Wear clean socks.",
      "content": "Wear clean socks. If you don’t play footsie with bare feet, make sure that your socks are clean. They should a fresh, clean pair of recently washed socks that you have put on that day. It is best if the socks are neat and without holes or sagging. Feeling an old sock riddles with holes rub against your leg can quickly ruin the mood. Your partner should also have clean feet or be wearing clean socks."

    {
      "title": "Be cautious around other people.",
      "content": "Be cautious around other people. Make sure that there is no chance that another, unintended person is feeling your footsie play. If you have to stop playing footsie suddenly, wink or smile at the other person to let them know it's not their fault. If you're in a large group, make sure you have your feet back in your shoes and socks in time to get up with everyone else when it's time to go. It is best to avoid playing footsie if you and your partner are sitting very close with other people."
