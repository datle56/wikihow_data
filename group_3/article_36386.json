      "content": "Cover a fresh oil stain with baking soda and let it sit overnight. First, says Stocker, use a cloth or paper towel to blot up as much of the extra oil as you can. Then generously sprinkle baking soda onto the stain. Let it sit overnight so the baking soda can absorb the oil, then brush away the powder the next morning. [1] X Expert Source Susan Stocker Professional Cleaner Expert Interview. 8 November 2019. After that, spritz the fabric with a 1:1 mixture of water and vinegar and let it sit for about 30 minutes, then gently scrub the spot with dish soap and a toothbrush until it's gone. [2] X Research source You don't have to pile up the baking soda, but do make sure that it covers the stain completely so you can't see the fabric beneath. Avoid rinsing the oil spot before trying to clean it. The water will form a coating around the oil and make it harder to remove. Once the stain is gone, blot away the soap with a damp cloth, or toss the item into the washing machine if it's washable.

      "content": "Attack stubborn oil stains with baking soda and a laundry pre-treater. Squirt a laundry stain pre-treater (like Shout) onto a set-in oil stain (i.e., an oil stain that's been sitting for a few hours), then sprinkle 1 tsp of baking soda on top of it. Rub the baking soda into the pre-treater with a toothbrush until it makes a paste, and then sprinkle on another layer of baking soda. Let the mixture sit overnight (or for at least 12 hours) before washing it on a normal cycle.

      "content": "Clean dried oil stains with dish soap and an enzyme-based detergent. Baking soda works by absorbing and breaking down the oil before it fully sets into fabric fibers. Once the oil stain is dried, especially if you put it in the dryer, baking soda won't work as well – but liquid dish soap and an enzyme-based laundry detergent may be able to remedy the problem! Enzyme-based detergents break down tough oil and grease stains. [4] X Research source To clean dried oil stains off your clothes, squeeze a few drops of dish soap onto the stain, let it absorb for a few seconds, then rub it in with your fingers or a soft bristle brush (like a toothbrush). Leave the dish soap to sit for another 5 minutes, then toss it in the washer with enzyme-based laundry detergent and wash it on the hottest temperature your clothes can withstand."

Then, after leaving a generous layer of baking soda on the stain overnight (or for at least 12 hours), vacuum the carpet thoroughly. [8] X Research source If the oil stain is still visible after following the steps above, try blotting it with a couple of drops of dish soap and a damp towel or sponge. Then rinse the area by pressing a warm, damp towel against it. Dry it with another towel, sprinkle more baking soda, and let it sit overnight again. The next day, vacuum the baking soda up like you did before. There is a chance the baking soda might clog your vacuum filter, and it could even find its way into the motor, damaging the machine .

If you use too much, it could accumulate on the floor underneath, and since it's slightly abrasive, it could damage that flooring. [14] X Research source"
