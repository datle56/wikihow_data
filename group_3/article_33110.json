      "content": "Set the stake. The banker puts up a bet of any amount. If you like, your group can decide on a minimum stake."
    },
    {
      "title": "Match the stake.",
      "content": "Match the stake. Each other dice player gets a chance to match some or all of the stake. Move on once the full stake is matched, or when no one else wants to put up a bet. Here are a couple examples: Example 1 : The banker puts up $25. Player one matches $15 of that stake, and player two puts up $10. The full $25 stake is matched, so no one else can bet. Continue to the next step. Example 2 : The banker puts up $100. Player one puts up $20, player two puts up $40, and no one else wants to bet. Since only $60 has been matched, the banker keeps the remaining $40 of his stake. Continue to the next step, playing for the $120 still on the table."

      "title": "Roll for an automatic win or loss.",
      "content": "Roll for an automatic win or loss. Once all bets are made, the banker rolls three dice. In most versions of this game, these results immediately end the round: [1] X Research source 4 + 5 + 6 exactly (\"c-lo\"): automatic win. Banker takes all the money. Any three of a kind (\"trips\"): automatic win. Any pair + 6: automatic win. (For example, 1 + 1 + 6 or 3 + 3 + 6.) 1 + 2 + 3 exactly: automatic loss. Banker pays out to each player, matching their stakes. Any pair + 1: automatic loss. (For example, 4 + 4 + 1 or 6 + 6 + 1.)"

Find the banker's score: Any pair + a 2, 3, 4, or 5: the banker's score equals the value of the third die. (For example, 1 + 1 + 4 gives a score of 4. A roll of 5 + 5 + 3 gives a score of 3.) Any other result: the banker rolls all three dice again until she gets a \"decision roll:\" a score, an automatic win, or an automatic loss."

      "content": "Try to beat the banker's score. If the banker rolled a score (not an automatic win or loss), each player gets a chance to roll three dice to try and beat it. This uses the same scoring rules, but only affects that player's stake: If a player rolls an automatic win or a score higher than the banker's, the banker pays that player an amount equal to the player's stake. If a player rolls an automatic loss or a score lower than the banker's, the player gives his stake to the banker. If a player rolls a score equal to the banker, no money changes hands. If a player rolls any other result, he re-rolls until one of the above happens."

Start the next round, using the same rules."

If the third die is the same, the higher pair wins. 3 + 3 + 5 beats 2 + 2 + 5, since 3 > 2."
