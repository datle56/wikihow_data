Clear the area around the pool table so that there are no objects that might get caught in the wheels and make it difficult to slide the dollies into place. When clearing objects from around/under your pool table, don't forget to remove any throw rugs, which can bunch and hamper the rolling of your dolly."

Due to the considerable weight of your pool table, if it gains too much speed it will be nearly impossible for you to stop. If you have a friend, each of you should push the pool table from opposite corners of the same side and, in a controlled fashion, move it through your home. If you are doing this on your own, you'll want to take a more central position, probably at the end of the longways side, between the two corner pockets. The weight of the pool table will make it difficult to turn corners. Take this into account when moving it through your home."

Depending on the design of your pool table, these could be attached to the table in various ways, though usually you'll find staples attaching each to the table. Lay on your back underneath the pocket and pry the staples out with a flathead screwdriver or staple puller. To prevent an errant stable falling into your eye, you do not lie directly under the pool table, and you might consider wearing some kind of eye protection."

It's safe to stack the pieces of slate on top of each other, but be sure each are properly fastened and don't jostle against anything the might cause damage.

Single pieces of slate will install more easily since you'll only have to slide it into place. For pool tables with three-piece slate parts, move each piece to your mostly assembled table, setting each atop it with space between the pieces. Then: Check to see the pieces haven't been damaged and fit together neatly. Are the dowel pins that connect the pieces bent or warped? If so, you may have to make a trip to the hardware store to buy a few new dowels. Slide each of the three slate pieces together with the proper connectors between and slot the assembled slate into its place on the table. Take care to not get your hands caught between pieces of slate. This can cause serious injury to hands and fingers."

      "content": "Take warps in stride. Older tables, or tables that have sat in one location for a long time, may have experienced warping, or may have conformed to the natural contours of the home in which it lived. This might mean that you need an additional piece, separate from the parts of your pool table, to balance it and negate any rocking you may notice once the table is moved. When choosing a piece to balance a rocking pool table, you need to choose a material that won't compress under the weight of it. Scrap steel or a sturdy tile might do the trick."

Have a friend hold the level atop a flat part of the frame and: Take the level reading. If the table isn't level, lift the end that needs adjusting.
