Dangerous signals : Any time a dog gets low and starts slinking as if trying to hide, that's a sign of danger. Dogs do this when they're trying to attack."

While most dogs you'll encounter are likely just over-excited, it's true that some dogs are aggressive in more dangerous ways, and should always be avoided. If you can't avoid the dog, such as when you're visiting someone's home, talk to the owner about possibly putting the dog into a separate room, or outside, while you're present. Don't make a big deal of it, just say you're not super-comfortable around dogs."

If you're feeling scared, dogs will also be able to tell and might become more anxious in turn, making the situation worse. The best thing you can do is to take deep, slow, even breaths and try to calm down. Don't make any noise. If you shout, whimper, or make any submissive sound, the dog will pick up on it and might be encouraged to continue acting aggressively. Try to count, if you're feeling really anxious. Take a slow breath for five beats and hold it for two, then let it out for five beats. Keep counting as you move away slowly."

      "content": "Crouch into a defensive posture, if necessary. The crouched position helps you seem less threatening to the dog but also shows him that you are not going to just roll-over on your back and expose your stomach to him. Flex your legs, and get into a football or squatting stance. This stance puts you in a maximum position of power because the largest muscles in your body (thigh muscles) are flexed, and your neck is protected, if escape should become necessary. Use your other forearm and fist to cover your neck, if necessary. This way, you have offered enough for the dog to acquire your scent, but you have not given up access to any vital areas of your body."

If you see a dog on the street without an owner that seems to be aggressive, call animal control immediately and go elsewhere. Write down the street address and take pictures of the animal if possible. If the dog belongs to someone and is on a leash, stay out of the range of it.

If you're being attacked by a dog, it's important to protect your head and neck as much as possible, and rolling up into a ball may be your safest bet. It's still better to stop moving as much as possible and stay big, however. Read this article for more information about what to do if you're attacked by a dog."
