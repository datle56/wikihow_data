      "title": "Strengthen your triceps and your pectorals with tricep push ups.",
      "content": "Strengthen your triceps and your pectorals with tricep push ups. Tricep push ups are simple exercises that can really work your tricep muscles, your pectoral muscles, and your shoulder muscles. [3] X Expert Source Julian Arana, M.S.eD., NCSF-CPT Certified Personal Trainer Expert Interview. 19 May 2020. If you are new to push ups, you may want to modify this exercise by dropping your legs to the ground so you can build strength in your arms over time. [4] X Research source To do tricep push ups, place your hands underneath your shoulders on an exercise mat. Make sure your fingers are spread wide and weight is distributed evenly between the 2 hands. Squeeze your abdominal muscles and straighten your legs behind you, coming up on the balls of your feet. Activate your leg muscles and push out from your heels. Your body should feel well supported and your lower back should be straight, not dipping or swaying from side to side. If you cannot hold the starting position, modify it by dropping to your knees, keeping your arms and shoulders straight. Keep your head in alignment with your back and lower your chest towards the floor. Your elbows should be tucked into your sides as you hover over your fingertips. It’s completely fine if you can only lower your body a few inches. The more often you do tricep push ups, the easier they become. Exhale as you press back up to the starting position. This is 1 rep. Do 3 sets of 8 tricep push ups to start to build up your tricep muscles."

      "content": "Challenge yourself with 2-2-2 push ups. If you feel comfortable with tricep push ups, you may want to try a variation on tricep pushups. The “2-2-2” push ups refer to 3 sets of 2 push ups using different hand placements: narrow, regular, and wide. The narrow push ups will work your tricep muscles and the wide push ups will work your chest muscles. Start in a plank position, with your shoulders directly under your hands and your hands shoulder-width apart. Keep your core engaged and activate your leg muscles so your plank is strong and straight. Do 2 push ups with regular hand placement. Then, move your hands wider so they are on the edge of your exercise mat. Do 2 push ups with this wide hand placement. Finally, move your hands into the center of the mat so your hands form a triangle directly under the middle of your chest. Do 2 push ups with this narrow hand placement. Repeat this sequence 3 times, doing 2 push ups of each hand placement."

      "content": "Do tricep dips with a chair. This exercise only requires access to a chair but it will help to strengthen your tricep muscles and give them more definition. Start by placing a chair on a sturdy surface against a wall with the seat facing towards you. You can also do tricep dips on the edge of a staircase (such as the 2nd or 3rd step from the bottom) or a workout bench. Stand 1 to 2 feet (0.30 to 0.61 m) in front of the edge of the seat of the chair. Place your hands behind you, shoulder width apart with your fingers gripping the edge of the chair. Bend your knees so they are at a 90-degree angle and your knees are directly above your ankles. Make sure there is an equal balance in your arms and legs. Inhale as you bend your elbows and bring your butt towards the floor. Look forward as you lower your body and make sure your arms bend at a 90-degree angle. Only bend your arms until you feel your arm muscles activating and working. Exhale as you raise your body back to the starting position. Do this gently and slowly so you do not hyperextend your shoulders. Be sure to retract your shoulder blades and keep your shoulders square and stabilized (not rolled forward or up). As soon as it is difficult to hold your shoulders still and pulled back, stop the range of motion. This is 1 rep. Repeat this exercise for 2 sets of 10 reps. You should feel your tricep muscles working after 2 sets of this exercise."

      "content": "Use free weights to do dumbbell tricep kickbacks. To do this arm strengthening exercise, you will need access to free weights and a workout bench or chair. If you are new to weightlifting, start with 1 to 5 lb (0.45 to 2.27 kg) weights so you can build your arm strength without hurting yourself. [5] X Research source Begin with a free weight in your right hand. Rest your left hand and bent left leg on the exercise bench. Your left hand should be directly under your left shoulder so it supports your body. Bend your right hand while holding the free weight, making sure your back is straight and your torso is almost parallel to the floor. Form a 90-degree angle between your forearm and your upper arm. Keep your head up and your neck straight. Exhale and use your triceps to lift the weight until your right arm is fully extended behind you. Supinate by turning your palm up as your arm moves back, so that your palm faces the ceiling. Move only your forearm and do not use your left hand or your legs. Pause once your right arm is fully extended, exhale, and then inhale as you bring the free weight back to the starting position. Repeat the dumbbell tricep kickbacks on the right side 10 times, then switch to the left side. Do 2 sets of 10 reps on both sides."

Activate your biceps muscles as you do this. This is 1 rep. Repeat this exercise for 2 sets of 10 reps."

Then, inhale as you punch your left fist upward as high as possible. Alternate from your right hand to your left hand for 60 seconds. Gradually increase speed until you are punching upward as fast as you can. Repeat this exercise for 1 to 2 minutes a day."

      "content": "Adjust your daily calorie intake. [9] X Expert Source Julian Arana, M.S.eD., NCSF-CPT Certified Personal Trainer Expert Interview. 19 May 2020. Adjust your calorie intake so you are not overeating or eating empty calories that can only add more fat to your arms. Once you calculate your calorie intake per day, which is based on your age, your weight, and your fitness level, try to consume enough calories every day to do exercise. Eat more vegetables, healthy fats, and lean protein. Each meal should include a serving of protein, 1 or 2 vegetable/fruit servings, and 1 complex carbohydrate serving such as a whole grain serving. Make sure your carb intake is in the recommended range of 20 to 50 grams (0.71 to 1.8 oz) per a day. [10] X Research source Reduce your consumption of carbs, sugars, and animal fats. Consuming foods high in carbs and sugars will cause your body to secrete insulin, which is a main fat storage hormone in your body. When your insulin levels drop, this allows your body to burn fat. Lower insulin levels also help your kidneys shed excess sodium and water, which will help you reduce any water weight you are carrying. [11] X Research source Cut out foods that are high in starch and carbs like French fries, potato chips, and white bread. Avoid foods high in artificial sugars like soft drinks, cakes, candy, and junk food."

Create a 7-day meal plan that covers 3 main meals (breakfast, lunch, dinner), scheduled at the same time of day, and 2 small snacks (between breakfast and lunch, and lunch and dinner), scheduled at the same time of day. A set meal plan will ensure you eat at a consistent time every day and do not skip or miss a meal. Consuming about 1,400 calories a day, combined with exercise, can help you to achieve healthy weight loss. [12] X Research source Write up a grocery list based on your meal plan and go food shopping at the beginning of the week. Keep your fridge stocked with all the necessary ingredients to make your meals for the week so you can prepare each meal easily and are not tempted to cheat or skip a meal."

Unsweetened green tea has a healthy amount of antioxidants and promotes overall health."

      "content": "Eat well before and after you exercise. To maintain your weight loss, you should always eat healthy before and after you do any exercise. Have a small light snack 1 to 2 hours before you work out so you have enough energy during your workout. Your post-work meals should be high in protein and carbohydrates and you should always eat within 2 hours of your workout. A meal like low-fat Greek yogurt with a few tablespoons of granola and fruit or a peanut butter and banana sandwich made with 1 slice of whole grain bread can help your body to recover after a workout and improve your muscle strength."
