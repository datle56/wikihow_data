      "content": "Drink caffeine. Having a cup of coffee or can of soda every day may help minimize your risk of developing Parkinson’s. Make sure to stay within recommended daily allowances for caffeine so that you don’t develop other health problems. [3] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Choose any beverage with caffeine, as there is no evidence that one type of caffeine is better than others. For example, you could have coffee, tea, cola, or energy drinks. Some foods even have natural caffeine. These include: protein bars, coffee-flavored ice cream or yogurt, and chocolate. [4] X Research source Consume less than 400 milligrams of caffeine daily. This is about four cups of brewed coffee, 10 cans of soda, or two “energy shot” drinks. [5] X Trustworthy Source US Food and Drug Administration U.S. government agency responsible for promoting public health Go to source If you are drinking soda in order to get caffeine, consider limiting how much you drink. Sodas are often packed with sugar and won’t promote good health if you drink them too often."

      "content": "Sip green tea. In addition to having coffee or tea, green tea may also prevent Parkinson’s. [6] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Green tea has compounds called green tea polyphenols, a type of antioxidant, that may eliminate free radicals in your system. [7] X Research source Be sure to read labels when drinking green tea. Some products have caffeine while others don’t. Remember that green tea counts towards your daily hydration totals."

      "title": "Enjoy more peppers.",
      "content": "Enjoy more peppers. Eating more peppers—red, green, yellow, and orange—may lower your risk for developing Parkinson’s. Incorporate peppers into daily meals and have them as snacks, both of which may help you stave off Parkinson’s when combined with other dietary and lifestyle choices. [8] X Research source Be aware that doctors are still unsure if raw or cooked peppers are better for decreasing your risk. Try having some peppers at each meal and make sure you vary the colors to get the most nutrients. For example, you could have an omelet with peppers at breakfast, a salad with diced peppers for lunch, and stuffed peppers for dinner. Have some pepper strips dipped in hummus or light ranch dressing for a snack."

      "content": "Be sure to eat lots of fresh, raw vegetables. In addition to eating peppers, having fresh and raw vegetables at every meal may decrease your Parkinson’s risk. This is because low levels of the B vitamin folate, which is also called folic acid, may increase your risk for the disease. [9] X Research source You can easily get folic acid by incorporating lots of vegetables in your diet. Some of the best sources of folate are: [10] X Research source Spinach Endive Romaine lettuce Asparagus Mustard greens Collard greens Okra Cabbage [11] X Research source"

Eating a healthy and nutritious diet can help you get antioxidants, but consider taking antioxidant supplements to help boost free radical elimination. [15] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Take supplements for Vitamins C and E. Consider getting mixed supplement that has multiple forms of Vitamin E to avoid possible side effects of this compound. Another antioxidant that may help is Omega-3 fatty acid.< [16] X Research source Try Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10), which is also present in foods such as organ meats, sardines, and mackerel.

      "content": "Limit your iron intake. Eating iron is important to staying healthy, but it’s important to consume it within recommended levels. Too much iron may put your body into oxidative stress, which is when your body releases toxic free radicals into your system. In turn, this can contribute to the degeneration of brain cells that are often found in Parkinson’s patients. [19] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Get no more than 8 mg iron daily if you are a man. Women over the age of 51 should also not have more than 8 mg iron every day. Women between the ages of 18 and 50 should have 18 mg iron as a part of their daily diet. For example, one cup of fortified breakfast cereals has 18 mg, 3 ounces of pan fried beef liver has 5mg, and ½ cup of boiled and drained spinach has 3mg. [20] X Research source"

[21] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Recognize that there is no dietary allowance for manganese. Instead, there is adequate intake (AI) use. Eat less than 1.6 mg if you are a man and 2.3 mg if you are a woman.

      "content": "Exercise regularly. One of the common treatments for Parkinson’s is physical activity. Regular physical activity or exercise may minimize your risk for developing the disease by about 30%. This may be especially true for people in their 30s and 40s, which is decades before Parkinson’s often develops. Try and get some type of physical activity most days of the week to try and reduce your Parkinson’s risk. [23] X Trustworthy Source Johns Hopkins Medicine Official resource database of the world-leading Johns Hopkins Hospital Go to source Do aerobic activity that gets your heart beating faster, which has a protective effect on brain tissue. Aim for at least 75 minutes of vigorous activity or 150 minutes of moderate activity each week. This translates to about 30 minutes five days a week. Do exercises and activities that challenge your body and that you enjoy. Things like hiking, walking, jogging or running, swimming, or biking are great options. Activities like jumping rope or on a trampoline can also get your heart pumping.

[25] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source These compounds can mimic the same function as Parkinson’s in the brain: they kill neurons in a small part of the brain called the substantia nigra pars compacta.

      "content": "Steer clear of solvents. Like pesticides, petrochemical solvents such as paints and glues may increase your risk for Parkinson’s. Although the evidence isn’t entirely clear on the connection between the two, it’s advisable to steer clear of solvents as much as you possibly can. [27] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Check product labels for the names of commonly used solvents including: isopropanol, toluene, xylene, white spirits, methylene chloride, trichloroethylene, and perchloroethylene. Make sure your employer uses safe practices if exposure to solvents is a part of your job. If not, contact OSHA at 1-800-321-6742 to file a report and set in motion getting proper protection from solvents. Use low-volatility paints and glues if you can. Make sure any area exposed to solvents is adequately ventilated with open windows and fans."

      "title": "Stay away from cigarettes.",
      "content": "Stay away from cigarettes. A strange fact about Parkinson’s is that people who smoke appear to be less likely to develop the disease; however, this is no reason to start smoking, because the harmful effects of smoking far outweigh any benefit you might gain against Parkinson’s. Recognize that the link between smoking and a lower risk of Parkinson’s is that tobacco is a nightshade plant. You can incorporate other healthy nightshades into your diet by eating veggies like peppers, cauliflower, eggplant, potatoes, and tomatoes."
