      "content": "Put the desired amount of Quikrete mix into a wheelbarrow or mortar tub, and make a hole in the middle. You can make the hole using a shovel or a hoe. This will make mixing the concrete easier. If you decide to mix in a mortar tub, bring the tub as close as possible to where you will be spreading the concrete. This way, you won't have to transport as much."

Drag the hoe towards you. The concrete will part, and the water will rush in. Keep dragging the hoe through the concrete, from top to bottom until everything is mixed. [1] X Research source"
