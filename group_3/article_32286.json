      "title": "Know the types.",
      "content": "Know the types. To start painting on canvas, first thing you need is an easel. When you are buying an easel, you need to decide what the main function of your easel will be. Also think about where you will do most of your painting. If you paint on the go, you need a small travel easel. If you paint in a small space, you need a compact, medium sized easel. If you have a large studio space, you can invest in a larger, more stable easel."

      "title": "Buy a travel easel.",
      "content": "Buy a travel easel. If you are looking for a travel easel, the most important thing to consider is weight and collapsing features. There are many different types. You can buy a lightweight aluminum one with collapsible tripod legs. You can also get one that folds up and fits into a travel case. Try models such as The Jullian Plein Air Easel PA1 or the Daler Rowney St Paulâ€™s Easel."

      "title": "Use a compact easel.",
      "content": "Use a compact easel. If you have very little space, try a table easel. Use these on desks or tables of any size or height. Instead of long legs, they have a sturdy base that sits on any flat surface and don't take up room on the floor. They come in wood or metal and can be either H framed or collapsible. They can hold canvases as large as 35 inches. Most have a notched stand on the back that can shift to fit any angle needs. Try Reeve's Art & Craft Work Station or Windsor & Newton's Eden model. If you have a little floor space to devote to your easel but not a large studio, there are some compact freestanding easels. They give great stability for small to medium sized canvases and can fold up smaller for easy, out of the way storage. They come in metal and wood. Look for models such as Windsor & Newton's Shannon or Mabefs Inclinable."

      "title": "Try a large easel.",
      "content": "Try a large easel. Large studio easels are made for long term use. They are heavy duty and have the capability to hold large canvases. You can also get ones with masts big enough for you to work on the bottom of the canvas at eye level on any size canvas. Try the Best University or Santa Fe II models.

      "title": "Decide on your paints.",
      "content": "Decide on your paints. There are two major types of paint used on canvas, oil and acrylic. They both have their pros and cons. The one you choose depends on what you want to paint and the way in which you want to paint it. You should weigh the pros and cons of each and decide which is best for your project. Acrylic paints dry fast. This can help if you want to do many layers or apply crisp lines. [3] X Expert Source Kelly Medford Professional Artist Expert Interview. 2 July 2019. It can be difficult when you are mixing paint and painting on large surfaces. You can get a defined edge, but color blending is hard. They don't change color over time, but they appear darker when they dry on the canvas. You can use super thin or thick layers because the paint will dry all the way through. They are also non toxic and have no smell. Acrylics also come off brushes with water. Oil paints allow longer working times because they take longer to dry. The extra drying time makes it harder to make crisp lines. [4] X Expert Source Kelly Medford Professional Artist Expert Interview. 2 July 2019. They blend well and make easy transitions between colors. The oil can degrade the linen or cotton fabric of the canvas. The color of the paint remains the same when it dries. It will yellow over time as the oil oxidizes. Oils are toxic and have a smell, due to the use of turpentine to thin the colors. Although it isn't as popular, you can also use watercolors on canvas. These appear lighter and less crisp, but can give a great atmospheric quality."

      "content": "Pick the brushes. To do any type of painting, you will need to have brushes. The type of brushes that you need will depend on the medium that you plan to paint with. There are eight different kinds of brushes. They come in many different sizes and are made with natural and synthetic fibers. If you plan on using acrylics, you should buy synthetic brushes. The materials in natural hair brushes degrade over time because of the components in acrylic paint. For oil painting, natural fiber brushes are better. The bristles are harder and make more distinct marks on the canvas. If you buy synthetic brushes for oil painting, make sure they are made for oil paints. Otherwise, they can break down and build up residue. The four most common brushes are the round, flat, bright, and filbert kinds. If you want to do detail work, you can use the pointed round, angular flat, fan, and detailed round brushes. [5] X Research source [6] X Research source [7] X Research source"

Canvases come as small as a few inch square and as large as a full sized wall. The most popular sizes of canvas range between 11 x 14 to 48 x 72 inches. [9] X Research source The two types of canvas are linen and cotton. They both hold oil and acrylic paint well. Cotton is cheaper, but it takes more work before you can paint on it. Linen is nicer, but it costs more. If you want to go one step further in making your own canvas, you can buy the fabric and wooden frame and stretch your own canvas.

      "title": "Pick your size.",
      "content": "Pick your size. You size your canvas by painting a type of glue to the surface of the canvas. This helps fill in the holes in the fabric of the canvas. This is so the paints aren't absorbed and misshapen when you start. The type of size you will need depends on the kind of paint you are working with. If you are working with acrylics or watercolors, you don't have to size your canvas. Many painters do to make the canvas stable for painting. If you are working with oil, you need to size to avoid color fading. The most traditional way to size a canvas is using rabbit skin glue. The most popular size for oil is poly vinyl acetate, or PVA size. You can use either one. If you use rabbit skin glue, you will have to mix it with water before you use it on the canvas.

They come in white or translucent colors that provide natural lighting for your painting. Oil, acrylic, and watercolors all have different types of gesso associated with them.

Using a brush or roller, paint the ground on the surface in a thin layer across the canvas. Wait 30 minutes to 1 hour between coats to let it dry, then apply another layer. You should apply 5-6 layers of the ground to the surface of the canvas. Let the ground dry for 24 hours before you start to paint. [18] X Research source"
