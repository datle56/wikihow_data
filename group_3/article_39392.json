      "title": "Undress the top layer of the bed.",
      "content": "Undress the top layer of the bed. Remove the comforter and any other top layer sheets to access the fitted sheet. This prank only works when the bed has both a fitted and a flat sheet. If your victim sleeps under a duvet without a flat sheet, you'll have to find another prank. Don't crinkle up the top sheets; fold or strategically place them on a piece of furniture. If the victim comes home to a wrinkled or ruffled comforter, they might suspect something and inspect the bed."
    },
    {
      "title": "Tuck the flat sheet at the head of the bed.",
      "content": "Tuck the flat sheet at the head of the bed. Spread out the flat sheet as you normally would to make the bed. Then, instead of tucking the sheet at the foot of the bed, tuck it in at the head of the bed. This is the main part of the prank. Straighten the sheet so that it rests flat across the bed. If your victim is an impeccable bed-maker, ensure that the sheet isn't wrinkled, since it will be noticeable."
    },
    {
      "title": "Fold the bottom edge of the sheet.",
      "content": "Fold the bottom edge of the sheet. Take the edge of the flat sheet near the foot of the bed and fold it up toward the head of the bed. Make it resemble a properly installed flat sheet, with the edge of the sheet resting just under the pillows. Take note of how your victim normally folds their sheet, and try to emulate it. Some people will do an additional fold with their sheet to make it look neater. Other people keep it folded nearly in half so it is easy to hop into bed."
    },
    {
      "title": "Make the bed.",
      "content": "Make the bed. Place the pillows, additional blankets, and/or bedspreads as they're made normally. These top layers will cover up the fold you created. Be sure you recreate the way the victim typically makes the bed. Make sure the folded sheet is covered by pillows and top blankets. Do a quick inspection of the bed to ensure it looks like a normally made bed."
    },
    {
      "title": "Hide in the room before the victim goes to bed.",
      "content": "Hide in the room before the victim goes to bed. Watch the person try to get into bed. They'll find that their feet are trapped in the fold! Once you see them struggling and confused, jump out and say “gotcha.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "Know your victim's sleep schedule.",
      "content": "Know your victim's sleep schedule. This is an easy trick if you live with the victim, or share a room with them. Once you learn the victim's sleep schedule, you can begin to plan around this time. If they go to sleep every night at 10:00 PM, you have up until that point to make your move."
    },
    {
      "title": "Learn their daytime schedule.",
      "content": "Learn their daytime schedule. Once you find out their normal sleep schedule, you should learn what time you should prepare the prank. If they go to school or work, you can use this time to prepare the prank. It could help if you talk to them the previous night: ”So Jamie, you have any plans tomorrow?” ”Working for the man tomorrow?” ”I'm going to the grocery store tomorrow, you want to come?”"
    },
    {
      "title": "Observe how they make their bed.",
      "content": "Observe how they make their bed. It will help if you know how the person's bed is normally made. The more you can make it appear normal, the less suspicious (and more surprised) the victim will be. Don't get caught snooping on them as they're dressing the bed. Instead, you should plan to inspect the bed at a separate time. A lot of people don't use sheets and only use a comforter or duvet. Make sure your victim uses a sheet or else the short sheet technique will not work. Make sure they typically fold the inner sheet underneath the comforter."
    },
    {
      "title": "Document the bed.",
      "content": "Document the bed. Some people are better learners with a visual cue. Take a picture of how the bed looks before you tamper with the bed. Once you are making the bed again, you'll have a visual cue to base the presentation on."
