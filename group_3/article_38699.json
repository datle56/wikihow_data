      "content": "Take high-quality photos of the item you’re selling. Hit the “Sell” button on the app or “List an item” on desktop, then be prepared to upload photos of the item you want to list. Take several well-lit photos that show your item from every angle. Mercari allows up to 12 photos per listing, and it’s recommended to include as many as possible. In general, buyers are more likely to make a purchase when they have detailed images of the item. [2] X Research source If possible, display the item against a white or neutral background with lots of natural or artificial light. Try not to have clutter in the background, as this may distract from the item, which should be the focal point. If the item has any flaws, be sure to include pictures of them so buyers don’t feel misled. Your first picture should be of the entire item."

      "content": "Describe the item in detail. Provide a detailed header and description of the item. Include the brand and product name, as well as the color and size or dimensions. Note any flaws or special features the item has, and refer the buyer to the relevant photo. Don’t use trending but irrelevant keywords just to get more views on your listing. [3] X Research source Include relevant hashtags, as well. Mercari allows you to use 3 per listing, so choose keywords that are most relevant to your listing. If you’re not sure what keywords to include, look at similar listings to see how those sellers described their item. Learn the Mercari lingo, as well. For example, NIB stands for “new in box,” NWT stands for “new with tags,” and NWOT stands for “new without tag.”"

      "content": "Price your item fairly and competitively. To increase your chances of making a sale, look at listings for items like yours to see how other sellers are pricing the item. Better yet, look at items that have already sold to see what buyers are willing to pay. Then, price your item accordingly. [4] X Research source If you price your item far above the usual asking price, potential buyers are likely to look elsewhere. If you price it too low, however, you won’t earn a good profit."

[5] X Research source Package your item carefully so that it won’t get damaged in the mail. Some sellers like to include little thank-you notes or pieces of candy to show appreciation for their customers, but this isn’t necessary. If you’re not sure how to package your item, Mercari provides some tips in their Help Center. If you prefer, you can ship independently with your preferred shipping company, but it’s generally easier and more affordable to ship with Mercari."

Mercari gives buyers 3 days to confirm that they’ve received the item and that it arrived as described. If it isn’t, they have the option of returning it. [7] X Research source Buyers can only return the item if it isn’t as described. Mercari does not allow returns simply because the buyer no longer wants the item.

Direct deposit can take up to 5 business days and is free unless the deposit fails; then a $2 fee is required. [8] X Research source To set up Instant Pay, you must verify your government ID and add your debit card to your account. To request a direct deposit into a checking account, enter your name as it appears on your checking account, as well as your routing number and account number.

When you promote an item with Offers to Likers, Mercari requires you to lower your listing price by at least 10%, and then they’ll send a notification of the price drop to the last 50 buyers who liked your item. For the Promote option, lower your price by at least 5% and Mercari will boost your listing in buyer search rankings. [9] X Research source Note that with Promote, you will not be able to raise the price above the discounted amount again.

While Mercari does not allow buyers to return items simply because they no longer want them, some buyers are able to get around this policy by claiming the item did not arrive as described, meaning the seller will lose their earnings.

A payment processing fee, or transaction fee, is the fee sellers must pay Mercari for handling the buyer’s payment and payment protections. The fee 2.9% + $0.50 of the entire transaction amount, meaning the sale price plus shipping. For example, if an item sold for a total of $50, expect to pay $1.95 in transaction fees.

In general, shipping with Mercari is the cheaper option, though you will have to pay for the shipping label, which serves as your shipping fee. The price depends on the item you’re shipping, its dimensions, and its weight. [21] X Research source This price is usually about 40% of what you’d pay if you ship independently, but this is not guaranteed."

If you frequently list items and make sales regularly, selling on Mercari can be a great side hustle. However, if you only want to sell one or two cheap items, it may not be worth it because of transaction and shipping fees.
