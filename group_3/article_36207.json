      "content": "Scrub the brick with a stiff brush to remove small spots of efflorescence. In mild cases, efflorescence can be removed simply by brushing the dry surface. Grab a dry, stiff-bristled nylon brush or a wire brush and scrub it against the surface to sweep away the efflorescence. Because efflorescence is powdery, wear a dust mask to protect your lungs. [1] X Research source Using a dry brush is most effective if the efflorescence is only in small patches. If there’s a large area of efflorescence, you may need to use a stronger method. It's good to avoid water if you can help it, because water is what causes efflorescence."

Cleaning expert Melanie Garcia says an exterior brick surface “can usually just be sprayed down with a water hose.” [2] X Expert Source Melanie Garcia Professional House Cleaner Expert Interview. 10 October 2019. For interior surfaces, use a spray bottle filled with water to wet the surface. Then, use a stiff brush and mild dish detergent to scrub away the powder. Rinse the soap off with fresh water. [3] X Research source Once the brick is dry, check to see if the efflorescence is gone. If it isn't, you may need to repeat this or try a stronger cleaning solution. When treating an outdoor wall, make sure the temperatures will be above freezing all day. If you’re cleaning bricks outside, another option is to use a pressure washer . Use the widest-angle tip that works without damaging the surface."

      "content": "Use a sandblaster to remove stubborn efflorescence. Sandblasting is a traditional method of cleaning brick. [5] X Research source Put on a face shield, rubber gloves, boots, and clothing that covers your arms and legs. Put down drop cloths to protect the surrounding area, and fill the blasting bucket with fine media . Set the sandblaster to the lowest setting and use it to wash away the efflorescence from a distance of at least 5 inches (13 cm). Go back and forth across the bricks using smooth, horizontal movements. Note that a sandblaster will wear away the surface of the bricks, so only use it if you’ve already attempted gentler methods of removal, and avoid sandblasting brick that’s over 20 years old. A sandblaster will remove more buildup than other methods but it also makes the brick more susceptible to efflorescence later on. When you’re done, sweep, shovel, or vacuum up any dust and debris from the blasted area. Then, apply a brick sealant to your brick surface. Work from the bottom of the surface up, following the instructions on the package, and keep the surrounding area covered with drop cloths while you apply it. If you don't feel comfortable using a sandblaster on your own, a contractor should be able to take care of it."

      "content": "Apply muriatic acid and water as a last resort. Landscaper Tony Hoang stresses, “For safety, use chemical-resistant gloves and goggles” when handling muriatic acid. [6] X Expert Source Tony Hoang Landscaping Manager Expert Interview. 17 February 2022. Mix 1 part muriatic acid with 12 parts water. Presoak the wall with fresh water, then apply the acid mixture using a stiff brush. Let the mixture soak into the brick for about 5 minutes. Then, rinse the brick surface with plain water. [7] X Research source Always wear protective equipment when working with acid. Warning: When mixing the solution, always pour acid into water, never water into acid. Pouring water into acid releases a large amount of heat and can cause the acid to splatter and burn you. Adding acid to water, on the other hand, allows the heat to be absorbed. Be aware that muriatic acid can stain or burn masonry, etch mortar joints, and cause premature deterioration through water penetration. Consider safer solutions instead, or call a professional to address the efflorescence."

      "title": "Efflorescence is caused by water-soluble salts on the material.",
      "content": "Efflorescence is caused by water-soluble salts on the material. Three conditions need to exist for efflorescence to occur: there are water-soluble salts in or on the material, moisture is present to make the salt a soluble solution, and the moisture evaporates as the salts move to the material’s surface. This causes the salt to crystallize, which forms efflorescence. [10] X Research source"

      "title": "Assess the affected structure’s age.",
      "content": "Assess the affected structure’s age. The age of a structure can often help you determine what caused the efflorescence. If the structure is under a year old, the efflorescence source is likely the building material itself or water that entered the structure during construction. If the structure is over a year old, there may be a new source of water in the building material. In this case, examine the structure for leaks. [12] X Research source Troubleshooting efflorescence is important because it allows you to determine the possible reason behind it so you can decide how to remedy the situation."
