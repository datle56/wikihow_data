      "content": "Take out the furniture if you need to. You may not have to remove the furniture in your RV for your floor replacement. However, if you have to replace the subfloor, or if you want you new flooring to extend underneath the couch or table, you'll need to take the furniture out. Unless the subfloor is damaged, the choice of whether to install new flooring under your furniture is largely aesthetic. Furniture in an RV is often bolted down, so you will probably need a wrench in order to remove it."

      "content": "Gather your safety materials. If you have to do any cutting with a saw, you’ll need to have safety goggles and a face mask nearby. You may also want heavy leather or canvas gloves to protect your hands while you’re working. It’s a good idea to have these on hand before you start your project just in case you need them. Open the windows and doors to ventilate the space as well."

      "content": "Use pliers to remove the staples holding the carpet in place. Removing carpet in an RV is time-consuming because of the many staples you’ll have to pry up. Grip each staple with your pliers, then rock the pliers back and forth until the staple comes free. Some people prefer to use a hammer and mallet for removing staples. Hook the claw of the hammer under the staple, then strike the hammer with the mallet to loosen the staple."

      "content": "Examine the subfloor after you remove the old carpet. Check the plywood subfloor for dark spots, soft areas, or cracks. If you notice any damage, use a skill saw to carefully cut outside of the area you need to remove. Repair the damaged area by nailing new marine plywood into the joists beneath the subfloor. Marine plywood is made to withstand temperature fluctuations as well as moisture, making it ideal for a travelling vehicle. Always wear safety goggles and a face mask when working with a skill saw."

Since you won’t need much carpet to cover your RV, you can save a lot of money if you can find a remnant that’s the right size. Remnants aren’t usually left out on the sales floor, so ask an associate if they can show you where they are."

      "content": "Hide gaps between the carpet and the wall with trim. Since the flooring is usually installed before the walls in an RV, there is usually a slight gap between the floor and the wall. You can hide this gap by installing the trim you removed earlier, or you can purchase new trim if you prefer.

However, removing the tile that is already in place will allow you to check the health of the subfloor. If you find mold or rot in your subfloor, you will need to use a skill saw to cut out the damaged area. You can then replace the damaged subfloor with a new sheet of marine plywood cut to fit. Always use caution when operating a skill saw. Wear protective glasses and a face mask to protect yourself from flying debris."
