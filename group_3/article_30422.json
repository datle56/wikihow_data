      "title": "Brainstorm specific characteristics about your ideal boyfriend.",
      "content": "Brainstorm specific characteristics about your ideal boyfriend. List physical characteristics, like height and eye color, plus their emotional and romantic qualities. Maybe you want someone who’s kind, sympathetic, silly, and spontaneous. Decide what you want from your future boyfriend—support while you’re in school? Someone to challenge you? [1] X Research source Get as specific as possible. Vague ideas risk attracting more of the same or someone who’s not a good fit. For example: “I want a boyfriend who’s tall with blue eyes and dark features. He’s hilarious but has a serious side, loves helping others, and balances me out when I’m stressed. He’s reliable but spontaneous and loves traveling.”"

      "title": "Write down what you want in a boyfriend in a manifestation journal.",
      "content": "Write down what you want in a boyfriend in a manifestation journal. Include the date and journal or write a letter to yourself using clear, concise, positive wording. Write everything in present tense (“I want” instead of “I would like” or “I wanted”) since you never know when your wish will come true. Try not to type your wish. Handwriting something is an act of creation that the universe finds favorable. It shows you’re putting in the effort! Keep your wish in your journal, tack it up on a vision board, or sleep with it under your pillow so it stays top-of-mind during your manifestation process."

      "title": "Imagine yourself feeling good in your ideal future relationship.",
      "content": "Imagine yourself feeling good in your ideal future relationship. Go to a quiet space where you won’t be disturbed and silence your phone so you’re distraction-free. Picture yourself spending quality time with your boyfriend, going out for drinks, laughing, and making happy memories. Remember that warm, loving feeling you get when you think about him. [2] X Research source Try regular meditating or making a vision board to help you get in the headspace to visualize clearly and happily. Hold on to that fuzzy feeling you get during your visualization. That positive energy is exactly what the universe needs to send your wish to you!"

      "title": "Let go of negative beliefs",
      "content": "Let go of negative beliefs about your ability to find or deserve love. Identify the thoughts that make you feel like you’ll never find a boyfriend—they might be things like “I’m bad at relationships” or “Every relationship is doomed to fail.” Choose to believe the opposite instead—“I’m good at building relationships” or “My relationships can succeed.” Acknowledge that you’re full of love, empathy, generosity, and understanding. You have all the tools you need to find and build a lasting relationship! When you let yourself stay full of negative thoughts, you prevent yourself from being open to finding Mr. Right."

      "title": "Replace your negative thoughts with buoyant, empowering beliefs.",
      "content": "Replace your negative thoughts with buoyant, empowering beliefs. Try a daily affirmations app like ThinkUp , journaling , or saying your affirmations out loud every day to build your confidence and raise your vibrations. Craft affirmations that speak to your personal desires and feelings. Try some of these to start: “I love deeply and deserve to be loved fully.” “I forgive myself for mistakes in old relationships when I didn’t know better.” “I deserve to find a boyfriend who supports me for who I am.”"

      "title": "Raise your vibrations and reflect the qualities of your ideal boyfriend.",
      "content": "Raise your vibrations and reflect the qualities of your ideal boyfriend. For example, if you want an adventurous, spontaneous boyfriend, start acting spontaneously yourself. If you want a caring, empathetic boyfriend, begin cultivating empathy in your daily life. This puts you on your future partner’s radar. Use your list of boyfriend qualities to brainstorm things you can do to develop some of the characteristics that you’re searching for. This does not mean you have to change who you are to attract a boyfriend. Instead, think of it as becoming a higher-vibing version of yourself."

      "title": "Brainstorm ways to put yourself out there and find your future boyfriend.",
      "content": "Brainstorm ways to put yourself out there and find your future boyfriend. Get out of your comfort zone and go to new places or try new activities you don’t normally do. Be more open to casual dates and to making new friends, too—you never know who will end up being the one! [3] X Research source Think of manifestation as both a spiritual, introspective practice as well as a path of action to help you reach your goals. You need both parts to succeed. Think to yourself, “How would a confident person who knows what they want approach dating?” and then try some of those ideas."

      "title": "Let go of expectations about how long manifesting a boyfriend will take.",
      "content": "Let go of expectations about how long manifesting a boyfriend will take. It comes down to divine timing—it may happen in a few days, or it may take weeks, months, or longer. Try not to obsess over the timeline. When you worry and fret, you start putting out negative vibrations which can delay your manifestation even more. [4] X Research source Remember that the universe will fulfill your wish at a time when it will do the most good. It can be frustrating, but do your best to stay patient and positive! Focus on things you’re currently grateful for so you don't obsess over things you’re waiting for. Try starting a gratitude journal to help the time pass."

      "title": "Stay positive any time you doubt yourself or your manifesting.",
      "content": "Stay positive any time you doubt yourself or your manifesting. Try to frame your journey logically—you have a spirit, so you can’t help but have spiritual experiences at some point. Remind yourself of that every day to keep your vibrations high and attract the boyfriend of your dreams! If your manifesting isn’t working, don’t feel like you have bad karma or don’t deserve success. You just need to refine your goals and manifesting method."

      "content": "Stay open to new possibilities and look for subtle clues that he’s near. Pay attention to small details, like constantly seeing a guy’s name, birthday, or something else about him pop up wherever you look. Acknowledge your intuition, too—you might just “have a feeling” that something’s changing or coming before it happens. [5] X Research source Others signs could be: You feel an instant attraction to someone you’ve just met You feel a pull toward someone (maybe you dream about them or have déjà vu around them) You keep seeing angel numbers like 222 or others, which are considered a message of love."

      "title": "Let go of the outcome and stop caring whether you find a boyfriend.",
      "content": "Let go of the outcome and stop caring whether you find a boyfriend. Don’t obsess over a specific person or whether your manifestation was successful. Obsession and preoccupation put out negative energy and erase all of the hard work you’ve done so far. Sit back and have faith—you’ve put in the effort, and the universe will reward you when the time is right! [6] X Research source Remember, the universe’s plan is always for the greater good. If you don’t find a boyfriend quickly, know that he’ll arrive when it’s best for you."
