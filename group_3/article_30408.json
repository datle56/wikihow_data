      "content": "Since the Legendary Sword Dealer spawns for 15 minutes every 3 hours, you can talk to the Manager to figure out where in the spawn cycle you are. After you've been on a server for 10 minutes, his dialogue will give you clues to guess when the Dealer has spawned. Here's what the Manager can say and what it means: \"Are you new to this island?\" You need to do the Colosseum Quest. \"It's still too early for you to be here.\" You joined the server less than 10 minutes ago. This server-hopping prevention tactic means that you need to be on a server for 10 minutes before talking to the Manager. \"Some pirates said they ran into him on a nearby island last week. Check back later and I'll let you know what I hear.\" You have about 3 hours before the Legendary Sword Dealer spawns. \"A man in here earlier claimed to see his ship nearby today. Check back with me later.\" About 1 hour and 15 minutes remain until the Dealer Spawns. \"I think he should be getting here soon, it's all anyone in here has been talking about.\" About 15 minutes until the Dealer spawns. \"Hey! I just saw him! He told me he would be in the area for 15 minutes. Good luck!\" The Legendary Sword Dealer spawned and you have 15 minutes to find him. \"Meh, he left not too long ago.\" The Legendary Sword Dealer has despawned and will respawn in another 3 hours.
