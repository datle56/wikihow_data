      "content": "Edit your power save settings. Your console might not be set up to charge controllers while in rest mode (standby). Rest mode is when your console is asleep, but not completely shut off. Your controller should have a flashing orange light when it's charging; if you don't see that light when your controller is plugged into your sleeping console, you may need to adjust your console settings.

      "title": "Look for wear and tear on the charging cable.",
      "content": "Look for wear and tear on the charging cable. Check for fraying wires, cracked or chipped plastic casings, or damage to the micro-USB or Type-A USB plugs. If your cable is old or you're not sure where it originally came from, consider replacing it with a stronger cable. A USB cable made for charging PS4 controllers would be the best replacement to ensure the controller can charge. Ensure the cable is the correct type. While they look the same, not every USB cable is made to do the same thing. Some cables are meant only for charging while some are meant for data transfer, and some charging cables can only transmit a certain amount of charge."

    {
      "title": "Look inside the charging port.",
      "content": "Look inside the charging port. A dirty charging port on the controller may lead to charging problems. It's easy for dust, crumbs, and dirt to get caught in the charging port of your controller, which may inhibit the micro-USB plug from getting a good connection. Clean the charging port using a can of compressed air. Carefully aim the air inside the controller's charging port and blow out any dirt or dust. Be sure to hold the can of compressed air straight up and down to avoid spraying any liquid into your controller, which could cause damage. You can also use a small brush to sweep away debris."

      "title": "Plug the controller in and turn it upside down.",
      "content": "Plug the controller in and turn it upside down. This may seem like a strange trick, but using gravity to your advantage may help pull debris out of the charging port or help the micro-USB plug seat inside the port better. Make sure you don't set the controller down in a position where the charging cable could get broken or bent. While this method may work, it should be regarded as a temporary fix since it's not as convenient to charge your controller while it's upside down, and it doesn't fix the root cause of the issue."
