      "content": "Nebularomantic people can’t distinguish romantic and platonic attraction. “Nebularomantic” is a neurosexuality specific to neurodiverse individuals, and it falls on the aromantic spectrum. It’s a label for people who have difficulty telling the difference between romantic and platonic attraction specifically due to their neurodivergence (or can’t tell the difference at all). [1] X Research source Some choose not to label their romantic orientation this way, while others feel it helps them communicate their confusion when it comes to attraction. Remember: nebularomanticism is specific to neurodivergent individuals. If you can’t differentiate between types of attraction but are neurotypical, a different label (like quoiromantic or platoniromantic) could apply to you."

      "content": "The idea of a nebularomantic orientation was likely coined in 2014. While there isn’t a definitive history for nebularomantic, it seems to have originated on Tumblr, a social networking and blogging platform. Tumblr user can-i-hide-in-you introduced the nebularomantic flag in August 2014 and cited Tumblr user space-revolutionary for having coined the term. [2] X Research source Ultimately, it’s hard to say for certain where the term nebularomantic comes from, but it gained popularity between 2015 and 2019 after its introduction on Tumblr. The term “nebularomantic” likely comes from the word “nebulous,” which means clouded or unclear. It’s also a contraction of the word “nebula,” which is a giant cloud of dust and gas in space. Thus, “nebularomantic” likely refers to a nebularomantic person’s judgment feeling clouded when trying to differentiate between types of attraction."

      "content": "The nebularomantic flag was designed with the colors of a nebula. As mentioned above, the flag itself was designed by Tumblr user can-i-hide-in-you in 2014. The colors of the flag, however, don’t have a specific meaning beyond being chosen by color-picking from a photo of a nebula. Thus, the flag reflects a nebula’s overall color scheme.

      "content": "Ask yourself if the nebularomantic label fits you. Do you struggle to differentiate between romantic and platonic attraction? If the answer is “yes” and you’re definitely neurodivergent, you could absolutely use “nebularomantic” to label your romantic orientation. However, you’re also not obligated to use labels if you don’t want to! [5] X Research source Remember, it’s important to get an official diagnosis, even if you already feel like you might have a neurodivergent condition. Neurodivergent people who identify as nebularomantic may also be offended if you use the term without actually being neurodivergent yourself."

Nebularoace refers to someone who identifies as both nebularomantic and nebulasexual. Quoiromantic.
