Alternatively, use bar soap, any hand or body bar soap will do (make sure it hasn't got any additives that may hinder its cleaning, i.e. one like Dove would not be suitable), or for very tough grease, look for bars labeled Laundry Soap. Dampen with water (or ammonia for extra grease removal), then rub the bar onto the stain until sufficient soap has transferred to foam up amply. You can also grate the bar soap and apply the resulting powder/pieces onto the stain after wetting.

A couple things to remember as you perform this step: Place your garment in a tub, washbasin, or other safe area. It's not recommended to place the garment on the floor and splatter extremely hot water all over it (and potentially your feet) Try to lift up the pot of water as high as possible. This method works for two reasons: The water is really hot, helping to break the grease and/or oil bonds. The water forcefully hits the grease/oil stain. The higher up the water is when you pour it over the stain, the more force it will generate as it hits the clothing. Be careful! You're using scalding hot water. Be sure to aim the water onto the garment. Try to avoid any splatter that might come back and hit you."
