Make sure you and your opponent have the same amount of cards in your decks! [2] X Research source"

There is a special rule for EX and GX Pokémon. If you knock out an EX or GX Pokémon, you get to take two instead of one Prize Card. Contrary to popular belief, you do not take or keep your opponent's Prize Cards. Once you knock out a Pokémon, you take Prize Cards from your own pile, and put them into your hand."

They stay there with the Pokémon until the Pokémon gets knocked out, at which point they both get discarded. When you play a stadium, it is placed horizontally between both player's fields.
