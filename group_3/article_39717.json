So, if you’re hoping to make someone feel extra special on their birthday, it’s a good idea to “describe on paper exactly how you feel about them,” and “say what you love and appreciate about them.” Here are some examples of the kinds of compliments you might write: “On your birthday, I want to let you know how inspired I am by your hard work and dedication. You never give up until you reach your goals, and it’s so powerful to watch!” “Your kindness, empathy, and giant heart are such blessings to everyone who knows you. Today and everyday, you should know how appreciated you are!” “Today, I want you to know that your creativity and artistic talent leave me completely in awe. It’s such a privilege to watch your journey, and I can’t wait to see what you achieve next!”"

      "content": "Consider doing something creative, like writing a poem. Ratson recommends doing something outside-the-box like this to make them feel super special, and he explains that the effort and creativity you put in symbolizes your love for the person. “It’s all about making them feel appreciated, unique, different… [and to show] that you really thought about them,” explains Ratson. Here are some ideas: You could compose a simple rhyming poem about this person’s traits and characteristics, and then write it down in a beautiful birthday card. You could write an acrostic poem , which is basically a list of words describing the person using each letter from their name. For example, for someone named Ella, the acrostic might read: E- empathetic, L - lovely, L- loyal, A- authentic."
