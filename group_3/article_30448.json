      "content": "Take a sip when… Grab a beer/wine cooler or prepare a mixed drink for everyone participating. Play the game as you normally would, with your ultimate goal being to achieve first place. To keep things interesting, pause and take a drink when: [1] X Research source You get hit by an item (e.g., green/red/blue shell, lightning bolt, Blooper, etc.) You run into a damaging item (e.g., a Bob-omb, fake item box, etc.) You fall off the map (even if you’re playing a newer version of the game where Lakitu saves you) The player in first place dodges a blue shell Note: These are just suggestions. Feel free to create a customized set of rules as you and your friends see fit! For instance, you could play a version of the game for online races (e.g., taking a drink whenever someone sends a message like “I’m using tilt controls”)."

      "title": "Beerio Kart",
      "content": "Beerio Kart Hand out a full, unopened beer to every participating player, and then start the race. The rules are simple: finish your beer before crossing the finish line. The catch? You need to stop your vehicle completely whenever you drink. The first person to cross the finish line wins the game! If beer isn’t really your thing, switch it out with a beverage that you and your fellow players enjoy more, like a mixed drink or wine cooler."

      "title": "Alcoholic Airtime",
      "content": "Alcoholic Airtime Set each player up with an unopened can/bottle of an alcoholic beverage. Start up the race as usual, with one condition: whenever you’re flying across the track on the paraglider, start chugging your drink until you return to the track on ground level. Whoever chugs their entire drink first is the big winner (even if they don’t cross the finish line first). Try to choose a chug-friendly drink for this challenge. A beer or wine cooler, for instance, might be easier to guzzle down than a mixed drink made with hard liquor."

      "title": "Submarine Showdown",
      "content": "Submarine Showdown Give everyone a drink before choosing a set of tracks with underwater portions (e.g., GCN Sherbert Land, Dolphin Shoals, etc.). Pause and take a drink when you first go underwater, and then take another sip when you re-emerge onto dry land. Whoever crosses the finish line first wins the game."

      "title": "Boozy Bullet Bill",
      "content": "Boozy Bullet Bill Give each player an item and start the race as you normally would. Should one of the players get a Bullet Bill item, require them to chug their drink until the Bullet Bill stops moving and despawns. Whoever comes in first place is the big winner. Make the game a little more interesting by requiring players to pause and take sips after minor inconveniences (e.g., getting hit by a shell, getting shrunk with lightning, etc.)."

      "title": "Rainbow Roadrage",
      "content": "Rainbow Roadrage Give everyone a mixed drink or other beverage to start the game with. Then, choose a Rainbow Road variation (depending on the version of Mario Kart you’re playing) and start the race. If somebody slips off the map, they need to pause and take a sip before continuing the race. It’s also possible to play this game with shots of hard liquor, but establish a shot limit if you do this."

      "title": "Coin Cocktail",
      "content": "Coin Cocktail Hand each player a drink before jumping into a round of Coin Runners in Battle Mode. Each player needs to drink when they gather more than 5 coins, or when they have less than 5 coins. The goal of the game is mostly to get blasted, but bonus points to whoever wins and comes out on top!"

      "title": "Balloon Blasters",
      "content": "Balloon Blasters Hand out drinks to each participating player and then boot up a round of Balloon Battle (in Battle Mode). Whenever you lose all 5 balloons, take a shot; if you lose all of your balloons, take an additional shot. There aren’t really winners and losers for this game, so just give the crown to whoever wins the match. Feel free to take sips instead of doing shots. If you all do shots, establish a shot maximum (like 2-3 shots) so no one gets sick."

      "title": "Shiny Spirits",
      "content": "Shiny Spirits Place an empty drinking cup in the center of the playing area. Then, give each player a drink before starting a new Shine Thief game (found in the Battle section of Mario Kart 8 Deluxe ). As soon as a player carries the Sun Sprite, they need to pour a small portion of their drink into the communal cup. This pattern repeats throughout the game until the round ends; at that point, the winner picks the unlucky loser who has to drink the communal drink mixture. If you’re feeling merciful, have everyone drink the same type of alcoholic beverage, like a beer or wine cooler. If you’re feeling especially fiendish, raise the stakes by having people drink different beverages."

All your fellow inmates have to take a sip as well when a new prisoner joins the mix. Should you all escape, take another sip to celebrate your freedom."

      "content": "Make sure your controllers are juiced up and ready to go. Whether you’re playing Mario Kart 8 Deluxe or kicking back with a classic like Mario Kart Wii , make sure that your controllers are either charged up or filled with fresh batteries. Depending on the size of your party, make sure there are enough controllers for everyone. If you’re playing an older version of Mario Kart that caps at 4 players, give other people a chance to switch out after each race/round."

      "title": "Stick with light alcohol if you plan on playing a lot of games.",
      "content": "Stick with light alcohol if you plan on playing a lot of games. A standard drink is considered 12 fl oz (350 mL) of beer (or 5% alcohol), 5 fl oz (150 mL) of wine (or 12% alcohol), or 1.5 fl oz (44 mL) of hard liquor (or 40% alcohol). [2] X Research source Drinking games can be a lot of fun, but their main purpose is to get you drunk fast. If you’d like to make the fun last a little longer, stick with a lighter drink that won’t get you blasted so quickly. Keep in mind that everyone’s alcohol tolerance is different. Some people might be able to drink a lot without showing any signs of drunkenness, while other people might start to get tipsy after a drink or 2. Keep an eye on your fellow party-goers to make sure everyone is feeling okay."

      "content": "Drink lots of water and eat snacks during the party. Drinking alcohol while hungry or thirsty is a recipe for disaster (and a potential hangover). Instead, practice drinking responsibly by offering plenty of non-salty snacks and hydrating drinks (like water or Pedialyte) to prevent anyone from getting too drunk . [3] X Research source"

[4] X Research source If someone seems well beyond the threshold of tipsy and well into “drunk” territory, cut them off and sideline them from any further races. Watch out for signs of alcohol poisoning , like vomiting, confusion, blue-tinted skin, and really slow breathing.
