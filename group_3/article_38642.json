      "content": "Know the different of categories of copper. Scrap copper can fall into one of six different categories. The different categories each have different values. If you sort the copper yourself, you can be sure that the scrap yard purchasing it is giving you the appropriate price. Otherwise, they are likely to lump all of your copper into one pile and give you the lowest overall price. [1] X Research source Copper solids are the most valuable. Copper solids are further categorized into three grades, depending on how pure they are. Copper non solids include dust and trimmings. Copper wire is generally found in electronics. Copper breakage is copper that has been recovered from items like motors and transformers. Copper alloy is copper mixed with other metals. This includes brass and bronze."

      "title": "Recognize copper solids.",
      "content": "Recognize copper solids. Copper solids are the most valuable kinds of copper to sell. They consist of pure, unalloyed copper. Unalloyed means that the copper is not mixed with any other kind of metal. The purity of copper determines its value because any added alloys interfere with the conductive properties of the copper. [2] X Research source Copper solids fall into one of three categories. Scrap copper number one is clean copper that is not less than 1/16-inch thick. [3] X Research source Bare bright copper wire falls into this category. Bare bright copper wire can be distinguished from the less-valuable tin-coated copper wire by its reddish color all the way through. [4] X Research source Some copper tubing can also fall into this category. The tubing must be free of solder, corrosion, paint and brass fitting to be considered number one copper. [5] X Research source Scrap copper number two is defined as unalloyed copper that is at least 96 percent pure. [6] X Research source Copper tubing that falls into this category includes burnt copper and copper with light tin coating, solder or brass fittings still attached [7] X Research source Scrap copper number three is light copper. Light copper solids are any copper sheeting that is less than 1/16-inch thick. Roofing copper generally falls into this category. It is found on roofs and gutters, and it may have tar or nails still attached. [8] X Research source"

      "title": "Identify copper non solids.",
      "content": "Identify copper non solids. This category includes dust, chips and turnings. It is generally not very valuable, and can fetch as low as 25 percent of the spot price of copper. If you have access to this type of copper, save it up until you get at least 10 pounds or more and then melt it down into nuggets before trying to sell it. [9] X Research source To melt copper dust, turnings or scraps, you will need materials specifically made for melting and casting metals. The melting point of copper is 1,981 degrees Fahrenheit, [10] X Research source so you need a kiln or furnace that can withstand that kind of heat. A potter's kiln can get hot enough to melt copper, but the oxidation process required to maintain that kind of heat will burn away a lot of the copper. Also, it will heavily contaminate the kiln. Look for bronze foundry casting tools and an electric or propane furnace made specifically for melting copper and other non-ferrous metals. [11] X Research source Artists often melt brass and copper for sculpture, and many have posted detailed tutorials for building a homemade furnace. Visit the Foundry Handbook for an example of a detailed tutorial for a DIY furnace using an oxy-acetylene torch for welding and a disposable helium tank or empty freon tank. [12] X Research source oxy-acetylene torch for welding Be aware, however, that the cost of powering the furnace with propane or electric will eat up about half the value of the copper. Therefore, it might not be worth investing in this process unless you have a steady, reliable source of a great deal of copper non-solids. Exercise caution when melting metal. For your safety, have safety gear such as protection goggles or face shield, dark welding goggles, oven gloves, a large flat iron pan to put the mold on, and running cold water."

      "title": "Sort scrap copper wire.",
      "content": "Sort scrap copper wire. While copper wire can technically be segregated into five grades, most scrap yards classify all wire as either high grade or low grade copper wire. High grade wire has a single layer of insulation, and low grade has a double layer. The five grades of copper wire range from 85 percent to 10 percent. [13] X Research source 85% wire is a thin wire with a diameter close to that of a pencil. 70% wire can generally be found inside electronics or appliances. An example is Romex machine wire without any attachments. 50% wire is found in extension cords and appliance cords. 35% wire is thinly gauged wire with many attachments. This wire is generally used for communications in VGA cables or telephone wires. 10% wire can be found in Christmas lights."

[14] X Research source Transformers, motors, alternators and magnetrons are all examples of copper breakage. [15] X Research source Disassemble parts to separate the copper from the steel in order to get the best price for the copper. Otherwise the scrap yard will lump the less valuable steel and copper together and you won’t get as much. [16] X Research source"

      "content": "Sell the copper alloys. Common copper alloys are brass and bronze. Technically, bronze is an alloy of copper and tin, and brass is an alloy of copper and zinc. But scrap yards lump them together and sell them at the same price. They refer to them both scrap copper alloys. [17] X Research source"

      "title": "Separate all metals before going to the yard.",
      "content": "Separate all metals before going to the yard. Before bringing your copper to the scrap yard, first sort your copper yourself into its three different grades. Sort tubing and wire into their different categories. This will give you an approximate idea of the overall value of your scrap copper. Unsorted and uncategorized lots of copper tend to sell for lower prices. [18] X Research source"

      "title": "Strip insulation off copper wire to get the best price.",
      "content": "Strip insulation off copper wire to get the best price. Before purchasing an expensive wire stripper, decide if you are going to be selling enough copper wire on a regular basis to make the investment worthwhile. A general rule of thumb is that if you are stripping more than 1,000 pounds of wire per month, then you should purchase an electric wire stripper. [19] X Research source If you are stripping less than 1,000 pounds per month, you do not need to invest in a wire stripper. If you decide not to buy a wire stripper, warm the wire first. Place it in the oven on low or put it inside a black box and leave it in the sun. This makes the insulation softer and easier to remove with a handheld stripping tool. Never under any circumstances should you burn the insulation off the wire."

      "title": "Melt copper non solids into nuggets.",
      "content": "Melt copper non solids into nuggets. Scrap yards will not purchase dust or turnings. Many sellers don’t even bother saving these because they are not valuable. If you have these materials, consider saving them until you have at least 10 pounds and then melting them down into nuggets with an electric or propane furnace made specifically for melting copper and other non-ferrous metals. A scrap yard may give you something for the nuggets, but be prepared to accept a price of up to 75 percent below market value for copper. It might not be worth the cost of the electricity or propane to run the furnace. [20] X Research source If you do decide to melt down copper dust and trimmings to sell it, invest in the right materials for melting copper. Copper melts at a temperature of 1,981 degrees Fahrenheit. Purchase metal casting materials that are specifically designed to withstand this kind of heat and melt copper and other non-ferrous metals. Typically, artists use these materials for casting bronze or copper sculpture. You can find a furnace and other materials for melting copper at a bronze foundry. Or, you can use an artist's tutorial, such as this one to build a furnace yourself. Exercise caution. Equip yourself with safety gear such as googles, face masks, oven gloves and running water. If using a homemade furnace, carefully check all gas couplings for leaks. Keep all flammable materials a safe distance away from the furnace. Be environmentally conscious when melting metals. Use as much exhaust to heat the flame as possible so you are not wasting gas or electricity. Dispose of any waste from the process at a recycling center for hazardous materials."

      "title": "Separate copper breakage.",
      "content": "Separate copper breakage. Some scrap yards will purchase transformers and motors that contain copper at a special “breakage” price. But you should take them apart and separate the copper to get the best value. [21] X Research source When taking apart transformers, don’t bother trying to cut the steel because it is too hard. Instead, cut the copper. It is softer and more malleable. [22] X Research source Try heating transformers in a bucket over a fire for 20 to 30 minutes. After heating, fill the bucket with ice water. The transformers will become very weak from the sudden change in temperature and be much easier to take apart. [23] X Research source Exercise safety precautions. Wear safety goggles to protect your eyes. Wear heat resistant gloves to protect your hands. Handle hot pieces with tongs to avoid having to touch them."

Other trade service websites, such as specialty metal sites or investment sites, list the daily prices for metals including copper. [24] X Research source Prices for commodities, including copper, are affected by market forces and change every day. Between 2004 and 2009, copper surged in value from approximately $1 per pound to close to $4 per pound. The value dipped dramatically in 2009 during the recession to approximately $1.50 per pound. But the price rebounded by 2012 to an all-time high of approximately $4.50 per pound. Since then, the price of copper has decreased. As of September, 2015, the price of copper per pound is about $2.43 per pound. [25] X Research source"

Cut off the plugs from the end to add to your brass pile. The small black boxes on charging cables can be cut off and put in your transformer pile. Search inside for insulated wires and connectors. [35] X Research source Thinner insulated copper wires can be found throughout old laptops, VCR’s and DVD players. Take apart desktop computer towers to find the ribbon wire and insulated connectors in the board and hard drive. Large appliances are often sold for steel. But don’t forget to look inside for copper wiring. Small appliances such as coffee makers, AC units, fans, blenders and toasters may all have copper wiring inside. Small electronics, such as cell phones, cameras and hand-held games are good places to search for copper wire."

Copper theft has been on the rise since the value of copper started to increase in 2004. CNBC refers to copper theft as an epidemic that is sweeping the United States. [38] X Research source The FBI states that copper theft is threatening the infrastructure of the United States. Thieves are targeting electrical sub-stations, cellular towers, telephone land lines, railroads, water wells, construction sites, and vacant homes. Delivery of electricity, water, telecommunications, transportation and security and emergency services is disrupted. This poses a threat to public safety and national security. [39] X Research source Businesses are taking steps to protect themselves from copper theft. They are installing security cameras, securing metals in locked areas, installing alarms, limiting access to buildings and increasing lighting. [40] X Research source In many states, the difference between a misdemeanor and a felony has to do with the value of items stolen. Since copper is so valuable, copper thieves are often charged with a felony when caught. Also, since copper thieves can knock out traffic lights or disrupt 911 services, other felony charges such as disrupting public service may be filed."
