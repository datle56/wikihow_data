Though you may think you'll feel more well-rested if you set your alarm for 15 minutes later in the morning, this may actually have a negative effect if it forces you get ready in a rush. If you don’t want to feel tired all day, it helps to walk out of the house feeling relaxed and refreshed instead of in a frenzy. Instead of setting your alarm later to catch a bit more sleep, try going to bed a little earlier at night. If you’re going to bed at the right time and allowing yourself an adequate amount of sleep , you may not even need to use an alarm clock anymore! [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Wake up promptly and positively, and take some deep breaths . Waking up with a positive attitude (that is, “on the right side of the bed”) is critical to feeling alert and refreshed. Treat waking up like a new opportunity to do great things, not as a chore! Try the following: Don't hit the snooze bar. This will just waste your time and will plunge you into a drowsy half-sleep for a few extra minutes. [2] X Research source Take a few deep breaths and fill your lungs with air. Get up and smile! Don't waste time playing around with your phone or yawning and tossing and turning. The sooner you get started, the better you'll feel. If you're still feeling sleepy, take a step outside or on your balcony to breathe in some crisp morning air."

      "content": "Begin your morning routine the same way each day. Some people like to start with a shower, others like to exercise, and still others prefer to begin with breakfast. Do whatever makes your body and mind feel like you're getting ready for your day, and stick to the same routine each morning. [3] X Trustworthy Source American Heart Association Leading nonprofit that funds medical research and public education Go to source Consistency is key. Find what works, and do it every morning—even on vacation! You might think that you need to take a cold shower to wake yourself up, since a warm one will presumably make you sleepy. In reality, though, if a warm shower is part of your morning routine, it will signal your body and mind that it’s time to get up and get moving. Consider having a radio in the bathroom to play your favorite pump-up music, or just sing to yourself."

      "content": "Start your day off with a healthy breakfast . While breakfast isn’t actually any more important than other meals during the day, it is a great way to get your body and mind off to a strong start. Fatty, carb-laden, and sugary foods—like pancakes and sausage—will leave you feeling bloated and lethargic, so try healthy options like the following: [4] X Research source Fruit, yogurt, and porridge. Greens like spinach, kale, or celery. Try mixing them up into a smoothie. Eggs and lean ham or turkey. Oatmeal, whole grain bread, or healthy cereals without tons of added sugar."

      "content": "Enjoy a cup of coffee later in the morning. So long as you don’t load it up with lots of sugar, a cup of coffee may provide quite a few health benefits. The caffeine it provides can also help you feel more alert. However, you’ll likely get more of a boost from that caffeine if you wait at least 1-2 hours after waking up before drinking your coffee, for the following reasons: [5] X Research source Cortisol is, among other things, your “alertness hormone.” Its levels in your body spike 3 times per day, usually within 2 hours after waking up, then at midday, and finally in early evening. Consuming caffeine while your cortisone level is up can signal your body to decrease the natural cortisone spike, which will end up making you feel more lethargic and tired. By drinking your coffee a bit later in the morning, you’ll add a caffeine kicker to your natural cortisol high."

      "content": "Stimulate your senses to keep your mind active. If your senses aren't stimulated, then your mind won't be stimulated, and you'll be headed toward nap mode. To help yourself stay alert, look for ways to stimulate your eyes, ears, and even your nose throughout the day. Try some of the following: [6] X Research source Keep your mouth engaged by sucking on a mint or chewing gum. Position yourself near a window that provides indirect sunlight. Sitting directly in the sun can make you tired, but being near sunlight can wake up your senses. Wake up your sense of smell by sniffing peppermint oil. You can carry a tiny bottle of it with you. Keep your eyes active by taking breaks to shift your gaze when they get tired from looking at the same thing. Listen to music. Jazz, hip-hop, or light rock can wake you up."

      "content": "Give your body mild stimulations to stay alert. Keeping your body stimulated is just as important as stimulating your senses. If your body is more alert, your mind will be too, so you should try to keep your body engaged no matter where you are. Try a few of these tricks: [7] X Research source Gently pull down on your earlobes. Pinch yourself in parts of your body that don't have much fat, such as your forearms or the space under your knees. Stretch your wrists by pulling your fingers back away from you. Roll your shoulders and your neck. If you really feel like you're in danger of falling asleep, lightly bite down on your tongue."

      "content": "Exercise in late morning or early afternoon for an alertness boost. While intense exercise might wear you out, light to moderate exercise will improve your overall energy level and make you feel invigorated. Take 15-30 minutes to exercise in the late morning or early afternoon, when you need an extra boost of energy. [8] X Research source Go for a brisk walk around the neighborhood. Nothing will wake you up like filling your lungs with fresh air. Take a midday yoga class. This is another great way to clear your mind, improve your breathing, and to get ready for the rest of the day. You’re engaging in moderate exercise if your heart rate is somewhat elevated and you’re breathing heavily enough that it’s tough to carry on a full conversation. Don’t do more than light exercise after mid-afternoon—if you work out late in the evening, your adrenaline will spike and it may be harder for you to fall asleep."

Even if you don't have time for a full workout, you can make your body more alert by engaging in some basic physical activity throughout your day. Just a few minutes of physical activity from time to time is a great way to tell your body, \"Hey, it's not time for sleep!\" [9] X Research source During the workday, take short walks in the halls or go across the street to get coffee. Avoid elevators whenever you can. Take the stairs instead. If you're sitting at a desk all day, stand to do some basic stretches at least once per hour."

Some great snack foods are almonds and cashews, celery sticks and peanut butter, and fresh or dried fruits. Eat three healthy and balanced meals throughout the day. Make room for some light snacking so you don't overindulge during mealtime. Avoid heavy meals, starchy foods, or foods that are high in fat or sugar. All of these foods will make you more tired and will tax your digestive system. Have some caffeine in the early afternoon, between your natural cortisol spikes at around midday and early evening.

If you’re in school, stay engaged in class by asking and answering questions. If necessary, take notes with pens in multiple colors so your note-taking feels less monotonous."

      "content": "Don’t rely on energy drinks to keep you going. Energy drinks often have at least double the amount of caffeine of a cup of coffee, and they frequently have excess sugar and various unregulated ingredients that may have unintended health consequences. It’s much safer to rely on getting enough sleep at night, eating healthy, and staying active during the day to avoid being tired. [13] X Research source Energy drinks will give you a temporary boost of alertness, so consider using them sparingly and only when necessary. Energy drinks can cause heart and blood vessel problems in some people, so talk to your doctor before using them, especially if you have any cardiovascular issues. Never mix energy drinks with alcohol, as it can make you more likely to drink too much without immediately recognizing the effects."
