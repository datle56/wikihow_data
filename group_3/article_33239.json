[2] X Research source Don’t touch any of your cards until the dealer officially states that the round has started, or else you’ll be charged with a penalty. You can deal 7 cards per player if you’d like to make the game a little easier."

Keep the rest of the cards in the center of the table so all the players can draw from the pile throughout the game. Take the top card and flip it over next to the deck so you can start gameplay. [3] X Research source If you run out of cards in the draw pile, shuffle the discarded cards and place them in the center of the play area. Once again, flip over the top card and place it face-up."

      "content": "Say “The name of the game is Mao” if you’re the dealer. The game of Mao follows a lot of strict rules, including when gameplay can actually start. Wait for the dealer to say “the name of the game is Mao,” and then the player to the left can start the game. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Play a card from your hand that matches the suit or rank of the center card. Look through your hand and see if any of your cards match the face-up card in the center of the table. Pick out a card that matches either the suit or face/number on the card that’s face-up. Place your designated card in the pile so that gameplay can continue. [5] X Research source For instance, if the center card is a red 10 of hearts, you can put down a card that’s part of the heart suit, or another 10 card. You can place a Joker card on top of any face card, but not on top of any numerical cards. The gameplay will follow the suit of the card that’s under the Joker."

If you don’t have any playable cards, pick up an additional card from the center pile and add it to your hand. This will count as your play for the turn. [6] X Research source"

Keep in mind that the rules of Mao differ between different players, and there’s no singular, official version of the game. If no one is familiar with the game, let 1 player review the rules before the game starts. If needed, players can call a point of order to clarify anything confusing. [8] X Research source If you’re playing with an experienced Mao player, you can follow the rules that they’re familiar with."

For instance, if a player puts down a 2 but doesn’t have any other playable cards, then their turn ends. Face value refers to a Jack, Queen, or King."

If you fail to draw a card, then other players have the right to penalize you. The only exception to this rule is if you have a 7 in your hand. You can play this 7, and the penalty will be transferred to the next player, who then has to pick up 2 cards. The player who puts down the 7 should say “have a nice day” before ending their turn. If you put down a second 7, you should say “have a very nice day” to the next player."

If you don’t say “one card” out loud before your turn ends, then another player can declare a penalty. Keep an eye on how many cards each player has left in their hand. If it looks like they’re getting low, they may be saying “one card” soon."

Don‘t use a “two-it” to get rid of your last card, or else you’ll qualify for a 5-card penalty. For example, if a player puts down a 9 of clubs, you can also put down a 9 of clubs, even if it’s not your turn. Keep in mind that if you’re only playing with 1 deck, you won’t have any identical cards."

For instance, you can say “Thank you for the penalty” or something similar."

If you notice a rule being broken, interrupt the game by saying “penalty for” and then list the penalty that the player did. Don’t state the rule that was broken—just let the other player know that their move was illegal. For instance, if someone puts down an 8, the gameplay needs to reverse immediately. If the next player continues to play in the same direction, you can say “penalty for putting down a card.” This helps keep the rules anonymous to new players while enforcing the parameters of the game."

At this point, all players need to put their cards face-down in the play area. No one is allowed to touch their cards until the “end point of order” is stated by the original player. If you touch your cards during a point of order, you need to draw a card as a penalty. Any player can call a point of order, which will pause the game and temporarily suspend the rules. Use a point of order if you need to clarify part of the game to another player, or if you need to take a break for some reason. [12] X Research source"

If you’re getting rid of a Jack as your final card, say “Mao Mao” instead. If you forget to say “Mao” or “Mao Mao,” you’ll be charged with a penalty and have to draw a new card.

If you do this, you’ll have to add an extra card to your hand. [14] X Research source Mao may be a frustrating game at first, but it’ll get easier as you play more games! If you really need to explain the game, call a point of order before doing so."
