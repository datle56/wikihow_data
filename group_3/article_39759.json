So, if you are siphoning water from a full bucket to an empty bucket, place the destination bucket on a stable, lower surface. [2] X Research source"

You may want to use a weight to keep the end of the hose in the water. You can use almost any type of hose or tube for siphoning . However, it really helps if the hose is clear so that you can see the progress of the water."

      "content": "Suck lightly on the end of the tube. Pick up the end of the siphon tube from the lower destination bucket or container. Lift it just above the container of water, which will help you avoid getting water in your mouth. Then, place your lips around the tube's end and suck like a straw. Pull the water just over the rim of the container of water. Once the water reaches the arc of the tube, it will start to come down the tube. Move your mouth and insert the tube into the bucket. [4] X Research source If your hose isn't long enough for you to weigh it down in the water and hold it up over the container, then you likely need a bigger hose. Be careful to watch the location of the water in the tube or you might end up swallowing some as it comes out of the end. This is a reason why it is not a good idea to siphon other liquids, like gasoline, with your mouth."

The water will start to run into the bucket through the siphon. It will continue until the upper container is emptied or you pull the siphon end out of either container."

      "content": "Immerse the tube in a container of water. Coil the siphon tube into a circle and place it into a container full of water. Gently push the tube down until it is completely covered, working from 1 end to the other. You will see air bubbles pop up to the surface of the water, as the air escapes from the inside of the tube. Go slowly to allow the air bubbles to escape as you submerge the tube. Once the bubbles stop, the tube is full of water and ready to be drained.

      "content": "Place your finger over the end of the tube. Now that the tube is full of water, you’ll need to stop up the end that you plan to pull out of the container. Fold or crimp the tube in on itself toward the end, creating a barrier. Then, place your finger or thumb over the end, blocking off the flow of water out of the tube. The tube must stay totally under the water during this process or you’ll end up with bubbles in it."

      "content": "Position the first garden hose. Put the end of your hose in the bottom of a higher container that the water will move out from. If you choose to anchor the hose down with an object to keep it from moving, just make sure that it doesn’t block the water flow. Then, place the opposite end of the same hose into a container that is the destination for the siphoned water. This is a great method to use if you need to siphon water over a longer distance or if you need to move a large amount of water."
