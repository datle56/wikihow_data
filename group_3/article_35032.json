      "content": "Stand upright and grab the rake comfortably. Raking leaves should be a comfortable endeavor. Grab the rake with both hands in a way that feels natural to you. As you rake and work your way around the yard, keep your back as straight as possible to avoid straining your neck, lower back, or core. [1] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source It can be difficult to rake a yard without bending over and staring down since that may feel like the intuitive thing to do. Do your best to keep your head up!"

      "title": "Keep the rake close to you and don’t twist your hips.",
      "content": "Keep the rake close to you and don’t twist your hips. Raking leaves shouldn’t be anything like shoveling snow or digging out weeds where you’re making huge gestures and movements. Keep your elbows close to your sides and hold the rake in front of you. When you maneuver the rake, keep your hips under your shoulders. Only move the rake and don’t twist your body. [2] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Rotating your hips while raking can irritate your lower back and the nerves in your legs. Bend your knees a little to give yourself a more stable base."

      "title": "Sweep the leaves in small, short strokes.",
      "content": "Sweep the leaves in small, short strokes. As tempting as it may be, avoid giant sweeping motions. Take your time and use smaller movements like you’re sweeping up a tiny pile of dust and you don’t want it to fly all over the place. [3] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Walk as you sweep the leaves to change where you’re raking instead of reaching out with your arms. Small strokes will keep your arms from tiring out and getting sore. This will also minimize the amount of strain you’re putting on your shoulders and back."

      "title": "Bag the leaves up for disposal.",
      "content": "Bag the leaves up for disposal. Once you’ve raked the leaves into a pile (or multiple piles), use your gloved hands to grab scoop up big chunks of leaves and stuff them in a bag. Tie the bag off and set it wherever your bulk collection is picked up by your collection services. [4] X Research source If you compost , you can transfer the leaves to your compost pile and let them break down naturally over time. If you’re raking a large yard, sweep the leaves on to a large tarp. When you’re done, just drag the tarp wherever your collection bin or bags are."

      "title": "Stretch before you rake to avoid hurting yourself.",
      "content": "Stretch before you rake to avoid hurting yourself. Raking leaves may not be on par with a marathon, but it can be a serious workout. Do some light stretching before you start raking to protect your body and avoid straining your back and shoulders. [5] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source You might touch your toes, do some arm circles, lean into side stretches, and pull your arms against your chest for a quick, simple stretching session."

      "content": "Divide your lawn into sections and rake in rows. You’re going to make things tough on yourself if you try to rake a big lawn into a single giant pile. Instead, visualize your lawn in quadrants, or smaller sections. Rake each section separately and create a series of smaller piles. When you rake, work your way around each section in rows. This will make raking your yard a lot easier to manage. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Follow the wind and work downhill if your yard isn’t level.",
      "content": "Follow the wind and work downhill if your yard isn’t level. If you notice some of the leaves floating in the light breeze while you rake, work your way in that direction. Let the wind help you out a bit to make the entire process easier. If you have any kind of slope to your yard, rake leaves in that direction as well. Fighting the wind or gravity is never going to be a winning strategy. Let nature be your guide!"

      "title": "Switch your hand positions periodically.",
      "content": "Switch your hand positions periodically. Every 2-3 minutes or so, switch which hand is on the top of the rake handle and which hand is on the bottom of the rake handle. This will keep your arms from tiring out and keep the overall pressure on your body more evenly distributed while you work.

      "content": "You should rake once the trees are mostly leafless. Unless you’ve got neighbors who will lose their mind if you don’t manage a pristine lawn, there’s no point to raking your lawn before the leaves have finished falling entirely. Wait for the trees around your home to shed all of their leaves before you break the rake and leaf bags out. [8] X Research source Many cities will only pick up bags of leaves in the mid or late fall. If your city has a specific pickup date, rake your leaves then. Usually, cities will offer leaf pickup alongside regular garbage pickup."

      "title": "Wait for a calm day during a dry spell to rake the leaves.",
      "content": "Wait for a calm day during a dry spell to rake the leaves. Raking leaves on a windy day is like trying to herd cats. If the wind is blowing the leaves around, just hold off on the raking. Wait for it to be relatively calm. [9] X Research source Also, avoid raking leaves when it has recently rained. Damp or mushy leaves are much harder to rake than dry leaves."

      "content": "You don’t have to rake—you can let the leaves break down naturally. Raking leaves to remove them from your lawn may improve the look of your yard, but that’s about all it does. Dead leaves actually make excellent mulch , and the leaf matter is extremely high in nitrogen which will keep your lawn soil healthy and your grass super green! [10] X Research source Leaves aren’t going to do any harm. Regardless of where they end up, they’ll just break down over time. It can take anywhere from 3-6 months for leaves to break down depending on where you live and what the climate is like. The other good reason to leave the leaves is that they can help the insects and animals in your yard! All kinds of critters eat leaves, hide under them, or use them for nest materials."

      "content": "Mow your lawn if the leaves are super bulky and you want to leave them. If you want to let the leaves decompose naturally but they’re totally covering the grass or they’re huge, wait for your grass to grow out and mow your lawn the same way you normally would. The mower will shred the leaves and speed up the decomposition process. [11] X Research source If the leaf cover is so thick that you can’t even see the grass, you’re best off mowing the lawn just so that your grass can get some sunlight."

      "title": "You can use a leaf blower to remove the leaves instead of raking.",
      "content": "You can use a leaf blower to remove the leaves instead of raking. If you don’t have a rake or you simply aren’t in the mood to rake your yard, use a leaf blower! Use the lowest speed setting necessary to blow all of the leaves into a corner of the yard where they’ll be easy to bag up. Alternatively, you can simply use the blower to spread the leaves out so that they decompose out of sight. [12] X Research source If possible, get an electric leaf blower. The gas-powered options are more powerful, but they’re not super great for the environment and they tend to be incredibly loud. Check your local laws before you use a leaf blower. They’re illegal in some cities because of the noise and pollution.

      "content": "Buy a wide rake with metal tines for the best results. If you’ve got a sizable yard, look for a metal rake that’s at least 24 inches (61 cm) wide. Metal tines are superior to plastic, since they won’t bend or catch on leaves as easily. Your rake should be at least shoulder-height to make it comfortable for you to hold and use. [14] X Research source Look for a rake labelled “no-clog.” These rakes are designed to not catch the leaves on the tines, which will make it a lot easier to sweep the leaves into neater piles. There is absolutely nothing wrong with use a cheaper plastic rake if you have a smaller yard."

      "content": "Wear thick gloves and long pants to protect your skin. It’s surprisingly easy to scratch your shin up with the tines of a rake when you’re raking up leaves, so throw on some thick jeans or work pants and boots. You can easily get blisters when you rake a lawn, so grab some heavy duty work gloves before you get to work! [15] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source You’ll also want to wear gloves when you pick the leaves up. There can be all kinds of bugs, dirt, and gunk hiding in piles of leaves."

      "content": "Bring plastic or paper bags depending on what your city requires. If you’re hauling the leaves to a composting site you can use whatever you want to carry them. If your city is picking the bags up though, check to see if they require black plastic or brown paper bags. Some cities will ask for black plastic since it can be recycled, while other cities require brown paper bags since they’re compostable. [16] X Research source"
