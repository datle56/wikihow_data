Count out your cards to make sure that you have all 52, otherwise you won't be able to win. Shuffle the deck and get ready to deal. Also consider playing online if you have a computer and an internet connection."

      "content": "Begin dealing the cards. Clock Patience takes its name from the setup: the cards are arranged in 12 piles of four, positioned in a circle. Each of these 12 piles takes the position of a number on a clock: one pile for 12 o'clock, one pile for 1 o'clock, one pile for 2 o'clock, and so on. Deal the cards face down into their 12 piles around the circle until each pile has four cards. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Play the first card. The middle, or 13th pile has four cards: turn one of them over and place it on top of its stack. Look at the number or face-value of the card. The number or face will determine where the card goes. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Move the card to its pile. Starting with the 1 o'clock position, cards belong in the stack associated with their number: Aces go to the 1 o'clock pile, twos go to the 2 o'clock pile, threes go to the 3 o'clock pile, fours go to the 4 o'clock pile, fives go to the 5 o'clock pile, sixes go to the 6 o'clock pile, sevens go to the 7 o'clock pile, eights go to the 8 o'clock pile, nines go to the 9 o'clock pile, tens go to the 10 o'clock pile. For face cards, place the Jacks in the 11 o'clock pile and Queens in the 12 o'clock pile. Kings will be placed in the middle, or 13th pile. When you find the correct pile, slide the card face up, under the stack it belongs in."

For example, a 7 of diamonds would go facedown into the bottom of the 7 o'clock pile. A Queen of spades would go facedown at the bottom of the 12 o'clock pile."
