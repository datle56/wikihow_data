Often times, our anxiety is caused by a mix of rational and irrational fears that compound upon each other and drive us toward having a panic attack. This, understandably, can undermine our ability to get some sleep. To counter this problem, simply tell yourself that everything is going to be alright. [1] X Trustworthy Source Mind U.K.-based mental health charity focused on providing advice and resources to anyone facing mental health problems. Go to source Reassure yourself that your anxiety is momentary and will soon pass. Tell yourself that while your fears are rational, you might be overreacting at the moment. Repeat “I am okay, I’ll be alright” or something similar to yourself over and over again. Try saying something like \"I tried to do my very best today. I'm worried, but it's not doing me any good right now to worry. I'll solve more problems tomorrow.\""

This could be anything, from a funny poem or a nonsensical statement to a spiritual or religious statement. Solving an abstract problem that bothers you on a purely intellectual level. Such a problem could be from the existence of God to whether black holes actually exist. Such problems are trivial to the extent that they won’t impact our daily lives (and panic us more) but are very important on an existential level. Counting sheep, stars, or dimples in your popcorn ceiling. Such activities will help distract you from the larger problems bothering you and may help put you to sleep."
