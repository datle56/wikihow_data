      "title": "“Slay the house down boots” means that something was done flawlessly.",
      "content": "“Slay the house down boots” means that something was done flawlessly. Originally used in drag ball culture to describe impeccable performances or looks, “slay the house down boots” is a purposefully over-the-top, humorous, and exuberant way of telling another person that they’re doing great at something (or looking great!). Slay means to present yourself confidently—whether walking, performing, or simply looking very good. If someone shows up to a party in a killer outfit, you could yell “Slay!” or tell them “That outfit is a slay.” Boots is like the word “very.” For example, you could say “Girl, that outfit is fierce boots” instead of “Girl, that outfit is very fierce.” House down also intensifies the meaning of something. It’s believed to come from the theater phrase “bring the house down,” which means that an audience is cheering so loudly that the roof might cave in. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Add “Houston, I’m deceased” to further emphasize your amazement.",
      "content": "Add “Houston, I’m deceased” to further emphasize your amazement. This term is a play on what astronauts say (“Houston, we have a problem.”) when communicating with NASA mission control in Houston, Texas. The idea is that something is so good it has to be communicated to the authorities. “I’m deceased” is a humorous way of giving praise—the speaker is saying the performance or a person’s appearance was so overwhelming they have died. You might say this to a drag artist who owns the stage during their show or a performer whose hair, makeup, and costume are so good that they’ve reached a new level of artistic expression. “You were so good up there! Slay the house down boots, Houston, I’m deceased!’ “Houston! I’m deceased because you slayed the house down BOOTS!”"

      "title": "“Slay the house down boots” comes from ballroom drag culture and AAVE.",
      "content": "“Slay the house down boots” comes from ballroom drag culture and AAVE. Since the 1920s, ballroom culture has been a safe space for LGBTQIA+ people—especially Black and Latinx individuals—to find community and celebrate their identity. Part of that expression was developing creative and witty terminology that hadn’t been widely used outside the community until recently. [3] X Research source Phrases like “Slay the house down boots” were used to compliment and fire up contestants competing in fashion and dancing categories. However, this phrase is part of African American Vernacular English (AAVE) and associated with the LGBTQIA+ community, so many feel that use by a wider audience is cultural appropriation. Drag slang has been popularized by the shows RuPaul’s Drag Race , Pose , Legendary , and more. Paris Is Burning , an award-winning documentary about the New York City ballroom scene, also introduced ballroom culture and slang to a wider audience when it was released in 1991 and then when the Criterion Collection version was released in 2020. Many modern “gay icons” also use ballroom slang occasionally. For example, English pop star Charli XCX posted a tweet saying “um yes queen, skinny legend Versace boots the house down, slay queen hunty mama and opp daddy, work charli xcx snatch my wig,” on April 20, 2021 The wider use of slang from ballroom culture is controversial. Many feel the original terms coined primarily by people of color are being co-opted and diluted, losing their cultural significance."

      "content": "Drag and ballroom culture has a whole language of creative slang terms. Many of these terms have seeped into mainstream culture due to the popularity of RuPaul’s Drag Race and contestants like Bob the Drag Queen. [4] X Research source Here are a few examples of other slang terms that came from ballroom culture: No Tea, No Shade: “Tea” is usually defined as the truth or gossip, while shade means delivering a subtle insult. So, “no tea, no shade” means you’re about to tell the truth without gossiping or purposefully insulting anyone. For example, “No tea, no shade, that color is not good with your complexion.” [5] X Research source Clock: Clocking generally means noticing something or identifying something a person wants to hide. For example, if a person’s lace on their wig is showing, another person might say, “Oh, miss thing, your hairline is clocked.” [6] X Research source Serving Face: This term means that you’re presenting your face confidently as if you’re being photographed. For example, “Look at her, serving face like she’s on the cover of Vogue . [7] X Research source Feeling the Fantasy: You’re feeling the fantasy when you really get into your drag character’s persona. For example, “Check you out! You’re feeling the fantasy tonight, aren’t you.” [8] X Research source She Owns Everything: “She owns everything” means someone looks so rich and fierce that they “own” the walkway, the room, the building, and possibly the entire world. For example, “In those rhinestone platforms, she owns everything.”"
