      "content": "Decide if it is time for removal. A medical professional will decide when it is time for a chest tube to be taken out. The following is a list of factors to consider. The chest tube has been used for about a week. Long use of chest tubes can increase the chance of infection. [5] X Research source The amount of fluid drained has decreased substantially, usually to less than 200 mL 24 hours. [6] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Family Physicians Organization devoted to improving the health of patients, families, and communities Go to source Respiration has returned to normal. The patient is no longer short of breath, the breathing rate has returned to normal, and the chest rises symmetrically upon air intake. [7] X Research source X-rays (or other tests) show an absence of air or fluid in the pleural cavity.

      "content": "Explain the procedure to the patient. It is important that the patient understands what he will need to do during the procedure, such as the Valsalva maneuver. [9] X Research source The patient may also be nervous about pain. They will remember the pain of insertion (if they were conscious), and chest tubes can also be quite painful while inserted. It will be important to reassure the patient, as the removal of a chest tube is usually less painful than going in.

The patient's knees may be flat or may be elevated by a small amount. The patient's arms should be relaxed and out of the way.

      "content": "Put on an apron and face shield. This is done to protect yourself from any splatter or drainage, as removing a chest tube can be a messy procedure. A face shield consists of a clear, plastic panel that straps around the forehead and covers the face. A surgery apron is a thin plastic gown that straps around the chest and covers the upper half of the body. [13] X Research source"

      "content": "Place a pad to collect drainage. A pad will protect the surroundings from drainage. Disposable pads often contain an absorbent fabric layer (to soak up liquid) and a plastic layer (to protect the covered surfaces). The plastic layer should go down. Several pads may be needed.

      "content": "Prepare a new dressing and tape for easy placement. Attach a single piece of tape to a prepared dressing and lay it in a convenient location. Also have strips of tape ready to use and lay them sticky-side up. Having the dressing ready to use will reduce the time it takes to cover the hole after the chest tube is removed. The hole must be sealed quickly to keep air from entering the pleural space, which could cause the lung to collapse. [15] X Research source"

      "content": "Remove the chest tube dressing carefully. Make sure to avoid tugging on the chest tube. The dressing usually consists of a soft bulky interior (to seal and protect the area) and tape around the edges. Peeling away the tape from several sides will release the dressing gently.

      "content": "Clamp the tube using a rubber-tipped Kelly clamp, and discontinue suction. This is to stop any air flow from entering or leaving the pleural space. The rubber tips help prevent damage to the chest tube. The Kelly clamp also locks itself in place using a gripping mechanism near the handles."

      "content": "Cut the anchor suture that holds the tube in place. [18] X Research source Warning: Do not puncture or cut the chest tube. The change in air pressure could cause the lungs to collapse. Warning: Make sure to hold the chest tube in place after the anchor suture has been cut, as there is nothing left holding the tube in place. Warning: If present, do not cut the purse-string suture. Some doctors prefer to include a purse-string suture when inserting the chest tube, for the purpose of closing the site once the tube has been removed."

Then the patient should close the back of the throat (the glottis or windpipe) and attempt to force air through it. The maneuver decreases the chance of the lungs collapsing as the chest tube is removed. The patent can alternately, instead of closing the back of the throat, hold the nose and mouth closed.

      "content": "Close the purse-string suture immediately, if present, and observe the site for escaping air. It may be necessary to have a second pair of hands to close the suture quickly. As the suture is tightened, the hole closes and prevents air from entering. The site should be examined for bubbling, which indicates airflow. [21] X Research source"
