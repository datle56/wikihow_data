      "title": "Slide wax paper under your finished puzzle.",
      "content": "Slide wax paper under your finished puzzle. Rip off one or more strips of wax paper—depending on the puzzle size—and carefully shimmy and slide them under the puzzle’s edges. Extend the wax paper beyond all the puzzle’s edges by at least 2 in (5.1 cm), and make sure the entire underside of the puzzle is resting on wax paper. [1] X Research source You can also assemble your puzzle on top of wax paper if you think you’ll want to permanently preserve it before building it. Check the finished dimensions of the puzzle on the box and create a wax paper work surface that’s at least 2 in (5.1 cm) bigger on all sides. Mod Podge may soak through puzzle pieces made of thin cardboard. If you don’t put wax paper underneath, the pieces may get glued to your table!"

      "content": "Roll over the puzzle with a rolling pin to smooth it out. Jigsaw puzzles tend to be a bit lumpy and/or wavy due to all the irregular joints among the pieces. Give the entire puzzle surface a few rolls back and forth with a kitchen rolling pin to flatten it. If you don’t have a rolling pin on hand, use a wine bottle or can of food."

      "content": "Use Mod Podge Puzzle Saver for the best results. There are several varieties of Mod Podge brand products, but Puzzle Saver is the best choice for this job. This product is specifically designed to preserve and protect your puzzles. [2] X Research source Puzzle Saver comes either in a large plastic jar (which is enough for at least a dozen puzzles) or a small plastic jar (which is enough for a couple of puzzles)."

      "content": "Dip the tip of foam-tipped paintbrush into the Mod Podge. Either dip the paintbrush directly into the Mod Podge container or pour some of the Mod Podge into a separate bowl. Be careful not to saturate the entire paintbrush, as the first coat should be fairly thin. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Brush a thin layer of Mod Podge over the puzzle with even strokes.",
      "content": "Brush a thin layer of Mod Podge over the puzzle with even strokes. Dip the foam brush tip back into the Mod Podge after every few strokes, as needed. While covering the whole puzzle surface in a thin layer of Mod Podge is most important here, using long, steady strokes in the same direction can reduce the number of brush marks you’ll have to sand away later. [4] X Research source Mod Podge Puzzle Saver is semi-translucent white in the jar and when you first apply it—but don’t worry, it becomes transparent when it dries!"

      "title": "Allow the first layer to dry for 15 to 20 minutes.",
      "content": "Allow the first layer to dry for 15 to 20 minutes. The first layer is dry when the Mod Podge goes from translucent white to transparent. Press your fingertip to several spots around the puzzle surface—if the Mod Podge is slightly tacky but not sticky, it’s ready for the second coat. [5] X Research source Keep in mind that Mod Podge may take slightly longer to dry in humid conditions. Save your paintbrush in a Ziplock bag in between coats to prevent the foam from hardening. Avoid cleaning it right away, as it won’t have time to dry completely before applying the second coat."

    {
      "title": "Apply a second, thicker coat using even strokes.",
      "content": "Apply a second, thicker coat using even strokes. Once the first coat is dry, dip the foam brush deeper into the Mod Podge and brush on more of the product with each stroke. Avoid just “glopping” the Mod Podge onto the puzzle surface—still use steady and long brushstrokes (as you did with the first coat). Use either a fresh foam paintbrush or the brush from the first coat that you stored in a Ziplock bag."

    {
      "title": "Allow the second coat to dry for at least 30 minutes.",
      "content": "Allow the second coat to dry for at least 30 minutes. Since the second coat is thicker, it may take a bit longer to dry. After 30 minutes, test the puzzle surface with your fingertip to see if the Mod Podge is still tacky. If it is, wait another 5 minutes and test again (adding additional time as needed). Remember that the drying time may take longer in humid conditions."

      "title": "Flip the puzzle over on the wax paper.",
      "content": "Flip the puzzle over on the wax paper. Once the puzzle is dry, carefully lift it by one edge and peel it away from the wax paper. Peel, lift and flip slowly and steadily to turn the puzzle over on the wax paper. The 2 coats of Mod Podge should be more than enough to keep the puzzle pieces in place. If you want to be extra cautious when flipping the puzzle, grab 2 flat sheets of cardboard larger than the puzzle. Slide the wax paper and puzzle onto one sheet of cardboard, lay the other sheet on top, and flip them over. Remove the cardboard sheets, peel away the wax paper, and slide new sheets of wax paper underneath the now upside-down puzzle."

      "title": "Brush a thick layer of Mod Podge onto the back of the puzzle.",
      "content": "Brush a thick layer of Mod Podge onto the back of the puzzle. Style points don’t count this time around! Just be sure to give the entire back of the puzzle a good coating of Mod Podge. This coating is simply an added layer of protection to further ensure the puzzle remains stuck together. [6] X Research source Some crafters skip this step altogether without any problems. Think of it as a “Mod Podge insurance” that’s recommended but not essential."

      "title": "Turn the puzzle back over after 15 to 20 minutes.",
      "content": "Turn the puzzle back over after 15 to 20 minutes. Test with your fingertip to make sure the Mod Podge is only slightly tacky. As you lift the puzzle, peel away the wax paper if it’s stuck to the edge, then flip it right-side up. Place it on the wax paper once again."

      "title": "Scrape off any excess glue along the edges with a crafting knife.",
      "content": "Scrape off any excess glue along the edges with a crafting knife . Some dried Mod Podge may extend over the edges of the puzzle. To remove it, lift one edge of the puzzle at a time and gently press a razor knife or other sharp crafting knife to the side of the edge (that is, not the top or bottom surface of the puzzle). Slide the blade along the edge, using gentle, even pressure, to scrape away the excess glue. Work carefully so you don’t cut into the puzzle—or cut yourself! For the best results, let your puzzle cure for at least 24 hours before removing any excess glue. This ensures that the puzzle is completely dry. [7] X Research source If you intend to frame the puzzle, feel free to skip this step and instead simply peel off any larger bits of overhanging glue with your fingers."

      "content": "Sand away any brush marks with #0000 steel wool . Even if you have an exceptional Mod Podge brushing technique, some dried brush marks may still be visible on the glossy puzzle surface. Grab a piece of #0000 steel wool (which is the ultra superfine type) and gently and evenly work it over the surface with small circular motions to smooth out the surface and “erase” visible brush strokes. Brush away any resulting dust on the surface with a clean cloth, or just take a deep breath and blow it off of the surface."

      "content": "Display the jigsaw puzzle as-is or frame it . With 2 coats of Mod Podge on the front and 1 on the back, your puzzle is sturdy enough to display by tacking or taping it to a wall. However, to add a bit more elegance to your display, place it inside a picture frame. To do this, simply Mod Podge a piece of foam core to the back of the puzzle, trim off the excess foam, and set it inside a frame. [8] X Research source As another display option, consider laying the puzzle on a wooden tabletop and setting a glass tabletop over it."
