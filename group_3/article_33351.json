      "content": "Choose a VPN. If you are unable to access Roblox on your school Chromebook, it is likely because your school's firewall prevents you from doing so. You therefore need a VPN, which can provide you with a new IP Address, bypassing any restrictions your school has put in place. A VPN also hides your internet activity, offering increased security and protection while you use your school Chromebook. It can be difficult to choose the best VPN , so be sure to explore all your options and make sure that your school has not blocked access to your VPN of choice. Notable options include NordVPN, Windscribe, and ExpressVPN."

Search \"proxy\" in your Chrome Settings to search for the proxy server settings and see if this simple solution is available to you.

Consider finding a good proxy server at home and entering that URL into your school Chromebook's web browser the next day."
