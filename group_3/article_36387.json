      "content": "Cover the stained area with baking soda or corn starch. Sprinkle the powder liberally and don’t worry about using too much.

      "content": "Press the rubbing alcohol onto the stained carpeting. After doing so thoroughly, let the carpeting dry.

      "content": "Remove excess rubbing alcohol from the carpeting. Once the carpeting has sufficiently dried and the stain has been erased, rinse the entire area with water, and blot the water out with a fresh cloth or paper towels. This should take care of any residual alcohol and reduce the odor. Do not use air fresheners or fragrances to deal with the smell, as this may only make matters worse. Open windows and turn on a fan; improving ventilation is the best approach."
