If you don't wish to perform the planche on bars, squat down on the floor with your hands planted on either side of you. Make sure your hands are planted a comfortable distance apart, so you'll be able to support your body adequately."

      "content": "Plant your hands directly below your navel. [2] X Research source Placement of your hands during a full planche is extremely important to its success. Before you lift yourself up, make sure your hands are planted facing forwards, roughly parallel to where your belly button will be when you lift yourself up. Experiment with different hand grips before you find one that works best for you."

[3] X Research source With your hands facing forward, put them on the ground (or bars) and lean forward, placing more weight on your Keep your arms completely straight as your lean forward. It's good to continue picturing yourself in a push-up position. As you lean forward however, you should be putting far more pressure on your hands than you would in a push-up. Leaning forward is a great way to train towards a planche, as it will get you used to the increasing pressure on your hands and wrists."

All of your body's weight should be focused on your hands. Keep your body straight throughout. Because this technique takes so much upper body strength, it's unlikely that you'll be able to pull one off without training in increments first. A good way to imagine a planche is as if you were doing a push up where your feet aren't touching the ground."

      "content": "Tighten your abs. [5] X Research source Tightening your body will help ensure your body's trunk is firm throughout the planche.

      "title": "Hold and return slowly.",
      "content": "Hold and return slowly. Most professional gymnasts see 30 seconds as a good goal to hold the position for. When you complete the full planche, return yourself slowly to a resting \"push up\" position. It is fine if you cannot hold it for the full 30 seconds at first. Simply getting yourself into position is difficult enough. It is helpful to train yourself in increasing increments. For example, once you achieve the position, try to hold for 5 seconds. Once you're able to do that comfortably, aim for 10, and so on."

Keep an eye out for the particular motion and stance in which the professionals execute their planche. Having a firm visual reference will help you figure out the specifics yourself. It may look very easy when professionals planche, but it is, in fact, an extremely difficult process. Even professional gymnasts may take years to properly figure it out."

[7] X Research source Because a full planche is such a difficult process, it's a good idea to train yourself up with considerably easier positions first. Although even the most basic planche is quite difficult to pull off, it's a more achievable goal to someone starting out. You should be able to hold each of these moves for at least 30 seconds before you try the next step in the process. Planching takes at least six months from the start of your training to being able to capably pull it off. You should keep this in mind and aim to be patient with your progressions."

      "content": "Push yourself up with a tucked planche. [8] X Research source Using gymnastics bars planted on the ground, push yourself up. However, unlike a regular planche where your legs would be extended, keep your legs tucked in under your body. This will reduce the amount of strength and balance required to hold the planche. When you're comfortable with a tucked planche, an advanced tucked planche will push your limits. An advanced tucked planche differs from a regular tucked planche because your legs are extended in an L-shape at the knee. This should increase the difficulty, both in terms of strength and balance. Tucked planches are easier because the weight is more situated towards the area you're lifting from. [9] X Research source"

      "content": "Planche with one leg. [10] X Research source A one-legged planche gets you accustomed to extending your legs completely without taking on the full weight of them. As you push yourself upward, extend one leg outward while keeping the other tucked as with a tucked planche. You should alternate between legs. This will strengthen up the two sides of your body, and make them both ready for a full-blown planche."

      "content": "Do a straddled planche. A straddled planche differs from the full planche in that both of your legs will be spread. Although you'll have the full body extension of a planche, the distribution of weight will be a bit easier to handle. Once you're able to consistently pull off straddled planches, you should be ready for a full-blown planche."

This is especially true with gymnastics, where any amount of \"empty calories\" runs the risk of adding extra weight for you to carry around.
