      "content": "Measure your chest or bust. Ask a friend to help you! This part is hard to do by yourself. Lift your arms up to the side and have your friend wrap the measuring tape under your armpits. Lower it until the tape is wrapped around the widest part of your chest. For women, wrap the tape around your bust, or the fullest part of your chest. [2] X Expert Source Alessio Iadicicco Apparel Manufacturing Specialist Expert Interview. 20 May 2021.

      "content": "Find the circumference of your natural waist. Pinpoint the natural crease of your waist by bending to one side. This crease will be higher than where you normally wear your pants — above your belly button, but typically just below your ribcage. Keep the tape measure parallel to the floor and measure all the way around your torso where this crease formed.

This measurement is important because — especially with a suit or formal jacket — you’ll want the shoulder of your jacket to lie flat, and not to bunch up or sag down over your upper bicep. If the shoulder of a jacket doesn’t fit right, you’ll often see wrinkles or lumps in the sleeves and top areas of the jacket. [11] X Research source"

Have a friend start from the bone at the base of your neck and run the tape measure all the way down to your wrist. This is how long your jacket sleeve should be. [12] X Expert Source Alessio Iadicicco Apparel Manufacturing Specialist Expert Interview. 20 May 2021. [13] X Research source This is a key measurement because, if your sleeves are too short or too long, it can make it look like the whole jacket is too small or too big for you."

      "content": "Find the circumference of your hips. Start the tape measure at one hip, wrap it around the other one and then connect it back to the one you started on. The tape measure should be wrapped around the widest part of your hips, around your buttocks. It can be hard to hold the tape measure level if you’re just measuring yourself, so ask a friend to help you so you can get the most accurate measurement. For men, a nice-fitting formal jacket should go past the waist and fall just over the widest curve of your hips, so this is a good measurement to know. [14] X Research source"

Jacket length varies based on height and the style of the jacket. For a standard blazer or coat, a good rule of thumb is to measure down to the top of the thigh. This may differ for women, though, as many women like the cropped jacket look because it can have a leg-lengthening effect."

Match your measurements to the right size, with the chest width being one of the most important measurements.

Regretfully, because different countries have instituted different systems of measurement for jackets, don’t rely too much on any general country-wide jacket guidelines.
