      "content": "Act as a role model for your peers. Sometimes, the most effective thing you can do is model inclusive language and actions for others. Put your values into practice, and help your peers understand what it means to treat others with dignity and respect. [1] X Research source Use the language preferred by individual communities. For example, \"autistic people\" instead of \"people with autism\" is the preferred language of the Autistic community. However, everyone has their own language preferences and beliefs. If an autistic person wants to be referred to as a “person who has autism,” use this language to refer to them. Respect other people’s chosen pronouns, names, or identities. If someone prefers to be called “he,” “she,” “they,” or something else, respect their wishes instead of trying to correct them. Challenge yourself and your friends to have lunch or start conversations with people of ethnicities, faiths, social groups, and identities other than your own."

      "title": "Involve the leaders of your community, school, or workplace.",
      "content": "Involve the leaders of your community, school, or workplace. Any programs you organize to promote your ideals will be most effective if you tap the resources of whoever’s in charge. A school principal, supervisor at work, or local government representative can broaden your impact and help you correct any specific injustices you’ve observed. [2] X Research source You could write in a letter or email, “I’ve noticed fellow students, faculty, and staff have good intentions, but don't know how to foster an inclusive atmosphere. Our community would benefit from a mentor, and I’d like to seek the administration’s support in hosting educational programs.” Reaching out to those in power can be intimidating. However, remember that principals are responsible for your well-being, bosses need to be stewards of companies, and your elected officials work for you."

      "content": "Focus your effort on specific issues so your message doesn’t get lost. Instead of taking on all social issues at once, tackle 1 issue that directly affects your community. Raise awareness of the problem through social media, public events, and 1-on-1 conversations.

Go to source For example, you might notice that sidewalks in your town are poorly maintained, which poses a hazard for people who may have mobility issues. Contact your city councilor, write to your local newspaper, or reach out to your local public works department to correct the issue. You might run a public fundraiser to donate books or clothing for children in need. You can also ask volunteers to offer free tutoring for these children. In areas with unequal access to healthcare, you could ask local doctors if they would be willing to offer their services for free for people with no health insurance."

      "content": "Tailor your approach to your audience to make a meaningful impact. Sometimes, people have a hard time getting out of their comfort zone. For friends or relatives who are confused by or resistant to your ideals, try to correct them in a positive way. Since a long lecture might go in 1 ear and out the other, try to keep your response brief and matter-of-fact. [4] X Research source For instance, if someone makes an offensive comment, you might say, “I understand you have a right to your opinion, but try to see things from a broader perspective. That joke might seem funny to you, but you wouldn’t be laughing if you were on the receiving end.”"

If your local government will not host an open town hall, hold your own. Book a room in a local library, community center, or school to host the event.
