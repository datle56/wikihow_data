      "content": "Save another player from a critical hit by casting silvery barbs . Critical hits can do a ton of damage because they allow the enemy to roll extra dice for their attack. Silvery barbs can be a strong spell to have on hand because it forces the enemy to reroll their attack, potentially saving another party member from colossal damage. [2] X Research source If the enemy casts counterspell and has to make an ability check to counter a level-4 or higher spell, you can also cast silvery barbs to make them reroll that check.

[5] X Research source This means you can cast it in an unconscious player after you cast it on an enemy, increasing their chances of rolling a 10 or higher to succeed the saving throw. [6] X Research source On the third death saving throw failure, your character dies permanently, so any help you can get from a spell like this one might be worth the spell slot."

[10] X Research source When you cast shield in reaction to the spell magic missile , you take no damage from it. Meanwhile, silvery barbs doesn’t negate the damage of other spells."
