      "content": "Shave in short strokes with the grain of your mustache. Using a fresh razor that has been heated with warm water, make short strokes in the same direction as the grain of the hair. Since hair does not typically grow at right angles out of a man’s face, you can test the grain direction for your particular mustache by running your fingers over the scruff to find the direction it feels smooth as opposed to prickly. For safety razors, you want to hold the razor at about a 30-degree angle, and you do not want to apply pressure. Simply allow the weight of the razor to slide across the skin with your hand guiding it instead of pulling it. For cartridge razors, keep the plane of the cutting surface parallel with the skin. The close spacing in multi-blade cartridges will likely require rinsing the blade after each short stroke. Stretch your upper lip downward to give yourself a taut, flat shaving surface. Especially if you have a thick mustache and didn’t trim it very short to start, this may take several passes. Be thorough, but also be aware that many passes can lead to more nicks and shaving irritation. Reapply shaving gel or soap as needed."

[6] X Research source This will give you the most control and precision with the straight razor. Do not apply pressure. Allow the weight of the blade to do the cutting and use your hand to guide it rather than to apply any pressure. To form a taut surface flatten your lip downward. You can also use your free hand to tilt your nose up slightly, which will additionally tighten the skin on your upper lip. Never under any circumstances use the blade in a sawing motion. If you've never used a straight razor before, consider practicing on a balloon. Apply shaving cream to a balloon and shave it off with the razor. If you pop the balloon, you're applying too much pressure. [7] X Expert Source Timmy Yanchun Professional Barber Expert Interview. 22 January 2020."
