      "content": "A classic side part gives you a clean, polished look. Side parts, sometimes called the “Ivy League,” usually require around 2-4 inches (5.08 cm-10.16 cm) of hair on the top of your head, and the good news is you don’t have to run to the barber to achieve this look. [1] X Research source Part your hair to the side, sweeping the hair over with a wide-toothed comb . Allow the hair to fall naturally, and rub a nickel-sized amount of matte pomade through your strands to add hold.

      "content": "A soft side part is a low-effort, relaxed look. Unlike a hard side part, a soft side part is more subtle and can be achieved with minimal effort and styling. Rake your fingers through your hair upwards and outwards to the side you’d like your hair to lie on. If you want your soft side part to hold, give your hair 3-5 spritzes of hairspray throughout to tame flyaways. As the spray dries, run a boar bristle brush through your hair in the direction you want your side part to be to maintain your style and keep those pesky hairs in place. If you’re not into a stiff hold, but want a little extra shine and frizz protection, try using 1-2 drops of anti-frizz oil . Rub the oil in your palms and run your hands through your hair, maintaining upward and outwards hand motions as you part your hair to one side."
