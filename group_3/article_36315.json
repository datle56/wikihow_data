      "content": "Massage the stain thoroughly. Using a clean rag or cloth massage the dish soap into the stained area. You want to make sure that you are allowing the soap to treat the affected area completely. For a deeper treatment consider using a sponge and only the tip of the cloth."

      "content": "Repeat this process for those tough-to-remove stains. For tougher stains, you may need to repeat the steps above a few times. Even if your stain was removed on the first try, it would not be a bad idea to re-treat the area to guarantee all of the dye is out of your shoe."

      "title": "Make a baking soda paste.",
      "content": "Make a baking soda paste. To make a paste, simply add between 2 and 4 spoonfuls of baking soda to a few tablespoons of warm water. Stir the mixture until a thick paste forms. If the paste does not thicken, add another spoonful of baking soda until you get your desired consistency. For lighter stains a paste may not be necessary. Adding 2 spoonfuls of baking soda to a small cup of warm water and applying with a clean rag, will do the trick."
