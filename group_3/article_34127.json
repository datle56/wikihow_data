      "content": "Keep your wallet in your front pocket to keep it close. If you usually store your wallet in your back pocket, keep it from being lifted while you can’t see it by moving it in your front pocket. It’s a lot harder for a pickpocket to steal your wallet, passport, phone, or money if it isn’t easily accessible to someone walking behind you. [1] X Research source Belongings can rise up out of back pockets when you walk for a period of time. This makes items in your back pocket much easier to steal."

      "content": "Wrap a rubber band around your wallet so it doesn’t slide out easily. Take a standard rubber band and stretch it out over the center of your wallet. Stick it deep in your pocket. If a thief tries to subtly snag your wallet, they’ll struggle to pull it out of your pocket. This will give you adequate notice that someone is trying to rob you. [2] X Research source If you have a choice, use a hook-and-loop fastener or fabric wallet instead of smooth leather. These are much harder to remove without you noticing."

[3] X Expert Source Archana Ramamoorthy, MS Tech Executive Expert Interview. 26 February 2019. Pickpockets tend to look in obvious places for valuables and money, and they won’t know where to look if your wallet is inside your jacket, in an invisible seam, or hidden near your breast pocket. [4] X Research source If you have to stash something in your jacket, put it in a hook-and-loop fastened pouch. The hook-and-loop fastener will make a bunch of noise if someone tries to reach inside of the pocket. You can use pants that have zippers on the inside or put your money in a neutral-colored infinity scarf that has a zip.

      "content": "Avoid rummaging through your wallet to count money. If possible, keep a separate money clip to hold your money or store it in a secure pocket. This way you won’t need to bring your wallet out to search through it for the bills that you need. If you are keeping your money in a wallet, only pull it out when you absolutely need to pay for something. Hold your wallet with both hands to avoid giving an opportunistic thief a chance to snatch it while you’re distracted. [6] X Research source If you are storing your money in a pocket, pick a front pocket on your pants or jacket. Do not store anything else in the pocket so that thieves think your pocket is empty."

Stuff your worn-out wallet with scraps of paper, empty gift cards, and random receipts. When traveling, keep your decoy wallet on you. If you are robbed or someone attempts to steal from you, pull your decoy wallet out, drop it, and run in the other direction. Don’t stick your decoy wallet out of your pocket so that it is highly visible. You don’t want to encourage people to rob you!"

      "content": "Choose a purse with a complex latch to deter pickpockets. If you typically use a purse with no closing mechanism, get a purse with a twisting latch or zipper. These purses are harder to open and a pickpocket likely won’t bother trying to slip their hand inside. If possible, use a purse with a lock on it to ensure that nothing goes missing while you’re traveling. The smaller you can make your purse, the better. Big purses provide more space for a thief to operate."

Pull the straps on your purse or backpack to shorten them and keep the bag closer to your body. This will make it much harder for someone to reach into your bag while you’re traveling.

However, a nylon fanny pack that sits tightly around your waist is much harder to cut or remove. Take your purse and move the cards and cash to your fanny pack. Tighten the straps around your waist and rotate the bag so that the pouch sits just below your belly button. This will make it easier to keep an eye on your valuables. [10] X Research source Do not use a fanny pack with the standard plastic buckle. Instead, get an anti-theft fanny pack online. These packs have tougher buckles, and can often be locked to prevent thieves from accessing their contents."

      "content": "Take what you need and leave the rest in your hotel safe. Most hotels have safes so that travelers can store important belongings while the room is being cleaned or they’re out on the town. Before you go out, place your passport, house keys, excess cash, and expensive jewelry in the safe and lock it. If you are pickpocketed, you’ll only lose some of your money and belongings. [11] X Research source Always leave some extra cash in your hotel safe. In the event that you are pickpocketed, you’ll still be able to get a ride and feed yourself before you can rectify the situation."

[12] X Expert Source Archana Ramamoorthy, MS Tech Executive Expert Interview. 26 February 2019. Try your best to avoid pulling it out frequently, especially when you’re focused on finding directions. If you do have to take your phone out, hold it firmly with both hands and don’t stare at it for more than 5-10 seconds at a time. [13] X Research source When you take your phone out to take photos, always put it back in your pocket when you’re done. Turn down offers from strangers to take your photo with your phone. Print the maps that you need at the hotel to avoid needing to use your phone to figure out where you are. Even if you don’t want to use it, it’s still a good idea to keep your phone on you.

Don’t bring your watch with you if it’s worth more than a few dollars. Avoid bringing jewelry with a lot of gemstones on them, regardless of whether they’re real or not. [14] X Research source Unless they’re incredibly loose, your rings are probably fine. They’re pretty hard to lift without you noticing. Be wary of wearing rings with gemstones in them, though. If you’re wearing a lot of jewels, pickpockets are more likely to assume that you’re carrying a lot of cash. If you can, don’t bring any jewelry on your trip. Unless you’re going out to a fancy dinner or show, there’s no need to bring it along."

Some thieves will work in pairs to distract you from one side while snatching your money while you aren’t looking. Other criminals will peek over your shoulder to see your PIN and try to lift your wallet later. If you have to use an ATM, find one inside a reputable business that isn’t out in the open so that you can withdraw your cash in a safe location. [15] X Research source ATMs that are tucked away inside of private nooks at restaurants and hotels are much more difficult to exploit."

Some thieves will pretend to accidentally bump into you while you’re walking down the street or getting on the bus. When they bump into you, they’ll reach into an easily-accessed pocket to try and grab something valuable. After anyone bumps into you, subtly pat your pockets to make sure that your personal belongings haven’t been lifted. [16] X Research source Avoid brushing up against people in crowds or tight quarters. Thieves often rely on dense crowds to avoid being noticed. Keep a tight hold on your belongings and remain alert when you’re on the bus, getting on a train, or wandering through a crowded metropolitan area. Be wary of interviewers, fundraisers, or chatty strangers. Pickpockets will often work in teams and try to distract you while someone robs you from behind."

Don’t look over their shoulder to reference a map and don’t lean in close to listen. Clever pickpockets will try to hold a map or pamphlet up to show you something while reaching into your pocket or bag. [17] X Research source Be cautious about accepting unsolicited help. Most people are just trying to help, but pickpockets often volunteer to help to lure you into feeling safe."

Avoid bright clothing that is going to make you stand out and stay away from tourist apparel to play down the fact that you’re visiting. Thieves are less likely to try robbing someone that lives where they do. [18] X Research source This won’t necessarily work if you’re an Brit with red hair travelling in India. If you’re really far from home, you may simply not be able to blend in."

In many countries, pickpockets will use a scooter or bike, pull up next to you, and rip any bags or purses off of your shoulder before speeding off. To avoid giving these thieves the opportunity, carry shopping bags and purses on the shoulder furthest from the street. [19] X Research source This is more common in countries with a lot of motorized scooters. In the United States, for example, this is not a common type of theft. Walk against the flow of traffic so that you can see a scooter or bike pulling up to you."

In addition, people often pull out their wallets to give street performers a couple of dollars. There’s nothing wrong with giving some spare change to a street performer, but pulling out your wallet reveals where you’re keeping it. Keep your valuables close and stay alert when enjoying some public entertainment. [20] X Research source If you do want to give a street performer money, keep a dollar or some spare change in a pocket where you aren’t storing your wallet. This way, potential thieves won’t know where you keep your cash when you go to donate some money."

If you’re carrying luggage on the train or unloading it from a cab, always refuse help from strangers offering to help you with your bags. Even if the luggage is on the heavier side, you never know when someone is going to sprint off with your goods. Some people may be genuinely trying to help, but it’s not worth risking your property. [21] X Research source It may be annoying, but it’s better to just take an extra 5-10 minutes to carry your luggage yourself."
