      "content": "Take an honest look at your current study habits. Being honest about ourselves can be hard, but to be successful, you need to understand where your strengths and weaknesses are. Understanding your current study habits can help you emphasize your strengths and work on improving your weaknesses, which will help you if you are struggling in a specific area. Start asking yourself questions about your study habits. Are you a good note taker? Are you good at memorizing facts? Are you good at writing essays? Are you good at reading but not math? Are you horrible at multiple choice tests?"

      "content": "Know your learning style. Every person learns differently. Some people learn by reading while others are more hands-on. Learning styles influence the way we learn and recall information. Understanding which learning styles you possess can help you be more effective in the classroom. [1] X Research source There are seven learning styles: Visual (spatial): You are a visual learner, respond well to pictures and images, and use spatial understanding. Aural (auditory-musical): You learn well with sound and music. Verbal (linguistic): You learn by using words, both spoken and written. Physical (kinesthetic): You are a hands-on learner. You learn through your body, by using your hands and sense of touch. Logical (mathematical): You respond to and learn through logic and reasoning. Social (interpersonal): You learn best when you with other people. Solitary (intrapersonal): You learn best when alone. [2] X Research source To discover your own learning style profile, try an online questionnaire like the one here . Once you have determined your particular learning style, you can start tailoring your academic habits to enhance learning ."

      "content": "Be organized. Organization includes many different things. Come prepared to your classes: bring the textbook, a notebook or notebook paper, pens or pencils, highlighters, notecards. Having all the materials not only makes things easier for you, but it leaves a good impression on your teachers. Keep a separate folder for each class. These folders should hold homework, tests, quizzes, notes, handouts, and any other course related material. Use dividers to keep your work separated by type so it's easy to find."

      "content": "Take notes. Even if your teacher doesn't make you take notes, writing down the main ideas, formulas, key words, and definitions from your teachers' lessons can improve your learning of the material. Write down questions about things your teacher says so you don't forget to ask later. [3] X Research source Make your notes clear and readable. Messy notes can lead to confusion and frustration later on. Also, make sure to be accurate. Don't jot everything down word for word. Instead, write down key concepts and key words or phrases. Jot down the term and go look it up at home later that night to define if you are having trouble keeping up with your teacher's lecture. Develop your own short-hand that will help you take notes faster and more efficiently. Organize your notes. Date them and keep them in a notebook. Have a separate notebook for each class, or use dividers to keep your notes for each class separate. [4] X Research source Review your notes each night. Taking good notes and never looking at them doesn't help you. Set aside a few minutes each night to read over your notes. Make questions about things you are confused about so you can ask your teacher in your next class. Refer to your textbook about anything that may need expanding. Use this time to start internalizing the information - it's never too early to start studying for your test! Students who are serious about taking good notes in class are more likely to come to class prepared, and they are less likely to get distracted in class."

Some classes will have a semester schedule with all the major assignments listed. In other classes, teachers will give you a weekly schedule, or announce assignments as the semester progresses. Buy a planner or calendar to keep track of all your homework assignments, essay due dates, and the dates of major tests. Many cell phones have calendar apps that you can plug your weekly and monthly schedule into. These apps have the option of adding comments to the scheduled task, and you can even set reminder alarms so you don't forget. Don't just schedule your assignments. High school is a busy time, filled with jobs, extracurricular activities, and social engagements. Put all those things into your calendar so you have an accurate view of your weekly commitments."

Do you like sitting at a desk or can you effectively study on your bed without falling asleep? Do you like to study alone or in a group? Do you do better when listening to music? The answers to these questions can help you find the ideal study space for you. Make sure your study space is comfortable. A rigid chair at an empty table in a quiet room doesn't have to be your study space. [5] X Research source But your study space needs to be free of distractions, and separate from the places where you do most of your lounging and relaxation."

At this stage in your life, school needs to come first in order for you to succeed. Review your notes every day. Research has shown that reviewing material within 24 hours of learning it helps retention by 60%. Schedule study time each week. Look at your weekly schedule, and pencil in study times throughout the week. Try to schedule study blocks for the same time every day and every week. This forms it into a habit that you will be less likely to break. Don't put off studying. The worst thing you can do is put off your academic work. Our lives are filled with distractions that are more fun than studying - from video games to sports to friends - but remember to keep on task. Remember to study on the weekends, too. A few minutes reviewing your notes will make a huge difference come test day. Study hard. One key to passing high school is not just simply getting by, but learning.

Even if some goals are taking longer than you anticipated, always reward yourself when your efforts pay off. Start with large goals. What do you want to achieve during high school? What do you want to accomplish before this year is out? After you have listed your goals, come up with a few ways you can accomplish these goals. Make mini goals. After deciding on your large goals, start setting smaller goals for yourself. What do you want to accomplish this week? Tonight? Even sitting down with your homework and asking yourself, \"What do I hope to have done by the end of my study session?\" can help you stay on task and be successful."

      "content": "Take good notes. Before you begin to study for an exam, you need to have taken good notes in class. Listen to what your teacher says closely. Many times, teachers will drop clues to what will be covered on the test. These hints can range from going over the information multiple times, using words like \"important\" or \"key\" when covering an idea, to even saying, \"This will be on the exam.\" Write down everything you think is important. The more you write down during class, the better prepared you will be for the test. Review your notes each day. Don't cram. Waiting until the night before an exam only hurts you. Cramming will sometimes give you a passing grade, but it is not an effective, reliable study method. Students who study consistently, but in shorter amounts of time, do better in school.

Guidance counselors offer you valuable information that can ease your navigation through school and get you on the right track from day one. Guidance counselors know all the classes you have to take to graduate. This is especially important as you plan each year's class load. Every school has certain classes each student must take, and if you are confused about how to fulfill your requirements, the guidance counselor can help you. If you want to go to a certain kind of college for a specific major, your guidance counselor can help you figure out what classes and extra-curricular activity will look best on your college applications. They can also help you figure out which classes will challenge you as you prepare for a college education. Guidance counselors are an essential resource for students with learning disabilities. They can work with you and your teachers to find the right accommodations for you. They can also help you with your college goals, including finding scholarships for students with disabilities. Guidance counselors can also help you if you are struggling with your classes. But academic help is not the only thing they can help you with. If you're struggling with something in your personal life, if you're feeling depressed, or if you're being bullied, counselors can be a person you can talk to. Meet with your counselor during your freshman year. Let them know your interests and your goals. If you're unsure about what you want to do, let them know that so they can help you.

Find clubs and extracurricular activities that truly interest you. Don't just join a club because you feel you should. High school is a period in your life where you are juggling many time commitments; make sure you are enjoying the activities where you are spending your time. Don't be a club hopper. Colleges prefer you to be involved in a few activities for a longer period of time instead of many clubs for only a short amount of time.

Read whatever you want - what interests you. This isn't for class; this is your own personal reading time. If you want to improve your reading skills, try reading challenging newspaper articles or novels. Look up words you don't know and try to commit them to memory. Writing is the basic form of communication. You'll be writing not only in school, but in any job that you get. Make writing part of your daily life. Keep a journal, write letters or e-mails, or try writing stories. Think about the basics of grammar and word usage to improve yourself.
