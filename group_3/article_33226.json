      "content": "Remember that Left 4 Dead is all about survival, no matter what mode you're playing. The L4D games are about staying alive -- not killing a big boss, saving the world, or racking up a high score. No matter what the mode, you objective is to stay alive for as long as possible. With that in mind, there is some general advice that will help you through any situation: Always keep moving. A standing target is an easy one to hit. Work together with all 3 teammates -- never go off alone. Conserve ammo and supplies, only using when necessary."

From the start screen, choose \"Campaign\" and start with \"Dead Center.\" If you've never played shooting games before, set the difficulty to easy and hit start. Campaigns are single-player games that give you three computer-controlled teammates (AI) to help you fight through the zombies. It does not matter which character you choose. In the game they all work identically. If you're with a friend you can choose \"Split-Screen\" as well. This is a normal campaign, but two of you can play together on the same mission with 2 AI teammates."

This gives you the chance to learn the controls if you're not used to them yet. While they are different on every console, you can easily check the controls in the start menu. To do so, hit \"Start\" and navigate to \"Controls.\" This screen will show you what each button or computer key does. The very basic controls that you must know include: Move and shoot. Switch weapon. Reload weapon. How to shove. How to use items (on yourself and others). [1] X Research source"

At the beginning of every level there are several Medkits, which are thick, rectangular red packs, and several weapons. Head over and pick them up. On the first level, they sit on a table right next to the door. Pistol: Your automatic first weapon. Pistols are weak but accurate and, most importantly, have unlimited ammunition. If you find another one on the ground, you can pick it up to dual wield them, effectively giving you double power, shots, and firing rate. Medkits: Medkits heal your character completely. You can also use them to heal teammates. You can only hold one at any time. You should always try and have 2-3 Medkits, at a minimum, in your party. Melee Weapons: Katanas, baseball bats, chainsaws, crowbars, and other melee weapons attack in a wide swath in front of you, often killing Infected instantly. They are good options in the early difficulties, and, with the exception of chainsaws, can be used infinitely. They replace your pistol."

The game is cooperative, and while it may be fun to run off and act like a hero, more often than not this will get you killed. One mistake can leave you stranded and turn your team of four into a team of three. The best way to survive is as a unit. So stick together, watching each other's backs at all times. The importance of teamwork cannot be overstated. The game will punish players who head off on their own, and so will your teammates. [2] X Research source"

They are not set in place and waiting there, in the same place, like most other games. Therefore, the longer you sit around, the harder the game is going to get. You need to be constantly moving forward, sticking together and clearing rooms before moving on. If you see side rooms, set two people at the door, then quickly send the other two in to look for supplies or guns. Whenever you need to open a door, push a button, or otherwise trigger an event (usually noted on the screen), tell your teammates and give them a chance to heal, use an item, or reload. Then move forward as a team. [3] X Research source"

At the end of some acts is the \"Crescendo Event,\" an enormous, incredibly difficult finale that requires you to complete some task or survive for a certain period of time. In the first level, Dead Center, this occurs when you need to fill the car up with gas. There will be a long, eerie silence. But once you start filling up the windows will shatter and an enormous Horde will descend upon you. Before starting a crescendo event, heal up, find all your supplies, and make a game plan with your teammates. All crescendo events will be noted to you by a \"!\" icon on the screen. Some of these events, like the car in Dead Center, only end once you've completed your objective (ie. fill up the car). You can't just sit there and wait it out because it will not end. Pay attention to the dialogue and objectives to end the rush as soon as possible. [4] X Research source"

All of them, however, are built on the same foundation: You have a setting, such as a mall, rainy town, or carnival, and there are 5 Chapters in each setting to survive. Each chapter is it's own level, which is often begins with ease before getting progressively more difficult. At the end of most chapters is a big event you must survive, and at the end of each setting is usually the most difficult challenge seen so far. As you play through each game mode, note where the major events and challenges fall, helping you stay better prepared next time you play. The basic objective of the game is always \"move forward.\" Levels are more or less linear, and your challenge is to make it to the end. When in doubt, save your items. The levels will only get harder. At the end of each chapter is a safe house with supplies, medkits, and ammunition. No zombies can enter it until you open the door, so this is a perfect place to catch your breath."

This means that you can't assume you'll get the same items or challenges each time you play. You need to be constantly adapting. If you decided to use a Medkit early on, assuming you'll get another one a few rooms down based on your last play-through, you'll be sorely disappointed when it doesn't appear. Even the number and intensity of enemies will change from game to game. You need to focus on the present moment if you want to succeed. [5] X Research source The Director can even change the route you must take to succeed. You must play to your current situation, instead of trying to figure out one perfect strategy for each level."

When you get caught, you have 2 seconds to find the smoker and shoot them before you lose control of your character. They cough and wheeze, but usually strike from a distance to hide. They are usually up high."

They come at specific locations, and they can kill an entire team if you're not careful. When handling them, concentrated fire is always the answer. You need to focus on them before anything else, as they deal far more damage than any other Infected. Witches: If you're lucky, you can avoid most of them. They sit, crying until you wake them with gunfire or a flashlight. If you see one, turn off the light and try and creep around them. If you can't, use your first few shots to kill them as they wake up, aiming for the head as a team. Rifles to the head are your best bet. Tanks: You'll need fire to kill a tank. If you have a Molotov, hit them immediately - tanks on fire die in 30 seconds without any bullets. As you do, move around a lot to dodge them, surrounding the tank as a team and shooting continually.

      "content": "Use items effectively in tense situations. Aside from weapons, there are other items available for pick-up, most of which should be reserved for tense or serious situations. Pain Pills: Gives you a temporary boost of health, though it will disappear after some time. This is incredibly helpful, however, for final events, where the extra boost saves a Medkit and gets you through the challenging events, allowing you to heal later fully. Adrenaline Shots: Provides a small health boost, and boosts your running speed. Most importantly, it keeps you from \"flinching,\" which is when you are temporarily unable to shoot after being hit. Use them right before huge moments, or if you need to get to a teammate to save them quickly. Bile Bombs: A grenade that causes all regular zombies to flock to the spot where it fell, ignoring you. If you throw it on another Zombie, the other Infected will attack them instead of you. Pipe Bombs: Like bile bombs, these cause Inflected to leave you and flock to the spot where you threw it. After a few seconds, as the infected crowd the spot, the bomb explodes, killing them all. Molotov Cocktails: Explode on impact, and leave a temporary lake of fire that hurts all Infected and humans that walk through it. Great at creating walls against the hordes of dead, and essential against the monstrous \"Tanks.\""

When you start out, you will only have access to a small variety of them, but more powerful weapons and items will appear as you progress. Shotguns: Coming in chrome, pump, and automatic options, shotguns are great options in close quarters. They deal a lot of damage and have a wide spread of fire, but they are inaccurate at long distances. Use them in hallways and other tight locations. Rifles: Powerful and accurate at long ranges, they are almost useless in tense, swarming situations because they take a while to aim and shoot. But they are great in a group and can clean up long-range, incoming enemies while the rest of the team waits patiently for them to reach shotgun range. Automatic Weapons: Submachine guns, M16s, and their ilk are your bread and butter. They have good power and a high rate of fire, allowing you to mow down medium and close range enemies. When in doubt, choose automatic weapons."

Zombies spawn at various points, and they are on a timer. Special Infected like Hunters and Smokers can appear anywhere but usually, come with a horde of Infected to cause maximum damage. There are, however, ways to predict when enemies are coming: Pay attention to the music -- it will start to swell and get tense as enemies build up out of sight. Turn on subtitles. You can often read things like, \"coughing sounds\" or \"noises of the horde\" in advance, making it easier to predict incoming groups or specials. Know the three stages of an attack. Build-up, as the music swells. Peak, when the big group descends on you, and Rest, after you've defeated them and have 1-2 minutes to relax. [7] X Research source"

When in crescendo events, or if you just need to catch your breath, choose spots with limited entryways (like rooms with only 1-2 doors or windows) or high areas where you force the enemy to bottleneck. Bullets pierce enemies and hit the Infected behind them, meaning you can mow down large groups quickly and conserve ammunition. Shooting down stairs, ladders, and in doorways can make big crowds much, much easier to handle. Still, keep moving when possible. Holing up for too long drains supplies and can leave you open to attacks by Boomers and Spitters."

In Versus mode, four players get the chance to play as Smokers, Boomers, Hunters, and more while fighting against four other human players. Playing as Infected is practically its own game, but the best advice is to think about all the ways you've died as a human. What sorts of attacks stranded you from teammates, caught you off-guard, or otherwise dealt more damage than you could handle? For the best results, use your teammates to coordinate attacks together. A Boomer can vomit, bringing in zombies that allow a good Spitter to trap pressured players in a corner, for example. Use surprise to your advantage. Let them run to you and hit them when they're distracted."
