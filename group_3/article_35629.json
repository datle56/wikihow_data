      "content": "Preparing your own meals can save 20% or more on food costs. There’s no way around it—eating at a restaurant or getting takeout is much more expensive than making a meal at home. [1] X Expert Source Trent Larsen, CFP® Certified Financial Planner Expert Interview. 22 July 2020. If you’re looking to cut your monthly spending, eat out sparingly and prepare most of your meals at home. [2] X Research source Pack your lunch instead of buying food at work or school. To save time, cook multiple meals at once and put them in the fridge or freezer to reheat later. Preparing your own meals is not only cheaper, it’s nearly always healthier as well. [3] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Healthy home-cooked foods like veggies, beans, and whole grains are cheaper and more filling than fast food or prepackaged snacks."

      "content": "Carry your own water bottle or coffee thermos to save money. Spending $1 or $2 on bottled water, or twice that much on a cup of coffee, may not seem like much. But that can quickly add up to $20 USD or more per week. Instead, fill up your own reusable water bottle in the morning and refill it as needed throughout the day. If you’re a coffee drinker, invest in a coffee pot and a thermos to make your own coffee and bring it with you to work or school. [4] X Research source Whatever kind of drink you prefer—from iced tea to smoothies to bottled sodas—it’s cheaper to bring your own from home instead of buying it at a shop or vending machine while you’re out. If you like flavored coffee, buy syrups and flavored creamers to make your coffee taste the way you like it."

      "content": "Always make a shopping list before you go to the store. The list gives you a clear idea of what you need and eliminates unnecessary purchases—but only if you focus on getting just what’s on the list! Take a look around your kitchen to determine what you need before you go to the store, and do your best to stick to your list as you shop. [5] X Trustworthy Source USDA Center for Nutrition Policy and Promotion U.S. agency responsible for promoting good nutrition based on scientific research Go to source If you go “off-list,” do it because a similar item is on sale—for instance, buying apples instead of pears because they’re a better deal. Fight the urge to make unnecessary impulse buys."

      "title": "Take advantage of ways to save money on the grocery items you need.",
      "content": "Take advantage of ways to save money on the grocery items you need. While making up your shopping list, go through store flyers and browse the internet for coupons and special deals. Don’t buy items you don’t really need just because you have coupons for them, but do make sure you use every cost-saving measure out there for the items you do need. For example: [6] X Research source Buy non-perishable items in bulk when they’re on sale, so long as you have room for them and know you’ll use them up over time. Buy fresh foods that are in season. They will cost less than the fresh food flown in from the other side of the world. Buy generics that are equivalent to name-brand items."

      "title": "Stop and ask yourself how important it is to spend on something.",
      "content": "Stop and ask yourself how important it is to spend on something. If the expenditure is a necessity, like buying a new laptop for work or school, definitely do it (but hunt for the best deal). If it’s a want, like a new shirt, consider if your money would be better spent (or saved) elsewhere. If it’s an unnecessary expenditure, like buying a cool pair of shoes when you have a very similar pair sitting at home, avoid it!"

      "content": "It’s not easy to stop buying tobacco or alcohol, but you can save big. Quitting smoking is not only great for your health, it’s also a great way to reduce expenses—if you smoke a pack a day, you’ll save around $2,000 USD per year by quitting. Cutting back on or cutting out alcohol is also a healthy choice that can save you money—the average American adult spends $1,200 USD per year on beer alone. [7] X Research source Unless you’re both really skilled and exceptionally lucky all the time, quitting gambling will also save you money."

      "content": "It’s harder psychologically to part with cash versus swiping a card. When you pull that cash out of your wallet and take a look at it, you’re more aware of its value and what you’re giving up to make a purchase. You just don’t get the same psychological impact from using a credit card, debit card, smartphone app, or even paper check for that matter. Shopping only with cash also makes it easier to stick to your budget—if your wallet is empty, you have to be done shopping! [8] X Research source If you’re already carrying a high-interest balance on your credit card, spending with cash will definitely save you money, even if you buy the exact same stuff. Better yet, though, don’t spend the cash and use it to pay down your credit card debt."

      "content": "Prioritize high-interest debt reduction for long-term benefits. Investing money in your savings is often the better option than paying off low-interest debts, but credit cards nearly always carry sky-high interest rates. Direct as much of your budget as you can manage toward paying off high-interest credit cards—you may not see immediate budget savings, but within maybe 6 months, or a year, or a couple of years, you will. And the budget benefits will only grow in the longer term. [9] X Research source"

      "content": "Make sure you’re not wasting money on cellular data usage. Check your smartphone’s settings to make sure it automatically uses Wi-Fi for data whenever it’s available. Reducing your monthly cellular data usage means you can switch to a lower-cost data plan, which can easily save you $20 USD or more per month. [10] X Research source Instead of paying for a set amount of cellular data per month, see if your wireless provider offers a “by the gig” plan that charges you based more closely on the amount of data you actually use. In some—but not all—cases this type of plan may save you money."

With all the streaming options out there, you may be able to “cut the cord” and save over $100 USD per month without much impact on your entertainment options. But make sure you’re actually using the streaming services you subscribe to as well—you might save another $20 or $30 USD per month by cutting back on those.

Keep them only if you’re absolutely sure you’re getting your money’s worth, and even then consider canceling them temporarily until you get your finances in order. At the very least, call the provider and say you’re planning to cancel—you’ll be surprised how often they’ll be willing to renegotiate! [13] X Research source Subscriptions and memberships are often automatically charged to your credit card or bank account, so check your statements to make sure you’re not still paying for subscriptions you forgot all about."

      "content": "Work with your landlord or mortgage lender to cut your costs. Changing tenants can be a hassle for landlords, so they may be willing to reduce your rent a little if you say you plan on moving otherwise. Don’t expect miraculous reductions, especially in a hot rental market, but maybe you can save yourself $25 or $50 USD per month this way. [14] X Research source If you own your home, contact your mortgage lender and several competitors to evaluate the rates and costs for refinancing your mortgage. If you refinance at the right time and the right interest rate, this can be a path to hundreds of dollars in savings per month."

      "content": "Find a cheaper place, get a roommate, or move in with your parents. If you can’t reduce your current rent or mortgage payment but still want to live on your own, start looking for a cheaper place to live that’s acceptable (instead of ideal) for your needs. Alternatively, bite the bullet and look for one or more roommates to share housing payments with, but make sure you do your homework and choose the right roommates . [15] X Research source Finding a roommate can save you a good amount of money per month, but moving back in with your parents can save you even more. To make it a bit easier to swallow your pride, pay your parents a nominal amount of rent and take care of your own stuff (like laundry)."

      "content": "Bundling your policies often results in savings of up to 25%. If you have auto insurance and either renter’s or homeowner’s insurance with separate companies, you can almost certainly save money by bundling these policies together with a single provider. Contact each of your current insurers individually, as well as several other competitors, to find the best bundling rate in your case. [16] X Research source Bundling doesn’t guarantee savings every single time, so check out competitors’ rates for individual policies as well."

      "content": "Public transit is good for the environment and usually your wallet. Add up how much you spend each month on fuel, parking, and upkeep for your vehicle, then compare that to public transportation costs. In nearly all cases you’ll save quite a bit by using the second option. The savings can be especially large if you commute to work or school in a densely populated area. [17] X Research source Depending on how close you live to your workplace or school, biking or walking might be another alternative to driving. You may even be able to sell your vehicle and put some extra money in your pocket."

Public transportation isn’t always an option, but carpooling is often a viable alternative to driving yourself to work (or school) every day. Ask coworkers who live nearby about starting a carpool schedule. Take turns driving to work to save 50% or more on your fuel, parking, and vehicle upkeep expenses. [18] X Research source Alternatively, instead of taking turns driving, have a single driver (with a reliable vehicle) and have all the passengers “chip in” a fair share of the cost."
