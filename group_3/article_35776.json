Determine how many barcodes you need, and click one of these two buttons to continue: Get a GS1 Company Prefix: A prefix allows you to get multiple codes at once, all prefaced with the same prefix that identifies your business as a brand. Company prefixes are great for businesses with growing product lines, as they can barcode anywhere from 10 to 100,000 products. [2] X Research source A company prefix costs $250, which includes 10 UPC barcode registrations. If you anticipate needing more than 10 UPCs, you can preorder in blocks of 100, 1000, 10,000, or 100,000. [3] X Research source Not sure how many barcodes you'll need? Check out GS1's barcode estimator at https://www.gs1us.org/tools/barcode-estimator/home . Get a GS1 US GTIN: If you have only a few products that need UPC barcodes, this might be the most cost-effective option. Single GTINs are great for small businesses looking to list products for sale quickly. You can license a single US GTIN for $30 with no annual renewal fee. [4] X Research source"

Keep in mind that each product that’s at all different from others should be entered individually, as it'll need its own UPC.

If you don't use this tool, you'll have to calculate this digit manually using another tool. Alternatively, you can click Choose a Specific GTIN to give each product a custom GTIN based on your existing product numbers. If you do this, you'll need to use the GS1 check digit calculator to generate the last number of each code, called the \"check digit.\" Without this last number, which an algorithm must create, your UPC will not work. [7] X Research source Keep in mind that if you're creating GTINs manually, every code must be 11 digits long. If your company prefix is 6 digits, which indicates 10,000 codes, each product number should be 5 digits long. If you have a 10-digit prefix indicating 10 UPCs, each product number can only be 1 digit. When you're finished, click Save and Continue .
