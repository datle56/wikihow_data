      "content": "Learn the proper way to hold the horn. As with any instrument, there is a proper way to hold your French horn in order to get the best sound possible. Place the index, middle, and ring fingers on the three keys. If you have a double horn, place your thumb on the trigger key, then wrap your pinky around the ring below the third key. Next, you want to work on your right hand positioning. [1] X Research source Sit up in a chair with your back straight so that you can breathe into the horn without obstruction. You usually want to sit on the edge of the chair to prevent slouching. Keep your body relaxed except for your mouth as tension makes it more difficult to play. Hold the horn at a 45-degree angle with the mouthpiece toward your face. Cup your hand and place your left thumb on the thumb key. Put your left index, middle, and ring fingers on the three keys on top. Your left pinkie should be through the pinkie ring, and your right hand inside the bell. Do not put your hand too far in the bell or the sound will be distorted. Now that your fingers are in place, bring the horn up so that the mouthpiece is against your lips. Reader Poll: We asked 350 wikiHow readers to tell us the number of instruments that they play, and only 11% of them said that they played 5 or more . [Take Poll] So if you play more than 4 instruments, you’re a rare person—and we’re impressed!"

      "content": "Form an embouchure with your lips. To blow into the mouthpiece, you have to first learn how to purse your lips. This is called, “embouchure.” Practice saying, “aaaah” followed by “mmmm” with your mouth, slowly adding pressure between your lips. Your lips should form a frown. However, make sure to keep your face relatively relaxed, as tensing your face too much can cause you to tire more easily. Keep your throat open. The corners of your mouth should be firm and stay in place, almost as if you’re puckering your lips. It’s a good idea to practice in front of a mirror to make sure you’re getting your form right.

      "content": "Blow into the horn. Without pressing any of the valves, you can use the embouchure technique to blow into the mouthpiece of the horn. You want to blow into the horn using fast, quick blows that come from your diaphragm, not your chest. Try to take in deep breaths before blowing. [3] X Research source Make sure you’re not pressing your mouth into the mouthpiece too hard. If your teeth hurt or a ring appears on your lips, you’re pressing too hard. You want a relaxed tension against the mouthpiece when you blow into it. If there isn't any sound coming out, make sure you're putting enough air through the horn."

      "content": "Memorize the keys. It will make your life a lot easier to learn exactly where the keys are so that your fingers know where to go when you’re playing. Through repeated playing, muscle memory builds, so your fingers know where the keys are. Practices pressing the keys, knowing which keys you’re pressing. Do this until you can pass a test of accuracy. It can help to have a fingering chart while you practice. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Learn how to control volume. The volume of the notes you play will depend on how much air you blow into the horn. The more air you blow, the louder the note will sound (and vice versa). Techniques that can help with controlling the amount of air you use is by thinking about keeping your teeth about a pinkie's width apart from each other."

      "content": "Learn the notes you’re playing. The most basic thing you’ll learn first is the order of the notes and how they’re placed on a music staff. Secondary to this is knowing how each of the notes feels on your face and to the amount of air you're using, not necessarily what they sound like. [6] X Research source Many parts go into the relationship between notes and the staff. That's why this piece is so fundamental."

      "content": "Play standing up. Now that you can hold your instrument and play sitting down, it’s time to play standing up. A French horn weighs about 4 pounds. There won’t be many times when you’ll need to play standing up, but recitals are a common one. Since your right hand is in the bell anyway, just slide it up to the top of the bell so that it’s resting on your hand. All your other hand placements stay the same. You can buy small modification pieces that help hold up the horn easier."

      "content": "Learn advanced techniques. Once you’ve mastered the basics you’re ready to learn more advanced playing techniques. It can be helpful to recruit a tutor or advanced player for these skills. Muting (or stopping) the horn creates a high-pitched sound from the bell. You can stop the horn by moving your hand further into the bell until it’s in all the way. Twist it until little or no air can get out. Slurring notes are playing two notes without stopping or releasing between. To do this you’ll continue to change the notes on your keys but your airflow remains constant and steady. Playing glissando is starting and ending on specific notes while playing as many notes between as you can."
