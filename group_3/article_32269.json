      "content": "Study various shapes and colors of pumpkins. It doesn't cost a dime to look. When you look with a discerning eye as an artist would, you begin to see things you never noticed before. Check out the varied shapes of pumpkins. Some are large, others tiny. Most are classic orange. Hybrids can be unique or of mixed patterns and colors. Stems are attached to make handles for the lid when a pumpkin is carved into a jack-o'-lantern. They vary, so look closely at them."

      "title": "Study the light.",
      "content": "Study the light. Watercolor and knowledge of light are two sides of a coin. You no doubt already know the two types of shadows, but now you can call them by name. Form shadows define the shape of an object. [1] X Research source On a pumpkin, a darker tone around the edges will show its roundness. A slightly darker shade of orange (or brown) within the curved growth lines on the pumpkin can show texture or how it would feel to the hand. Sometimes the lines are deep, and other times barely visible. Even the stem will have a shadow showing its roundness."

    {
      "title": "Understand how cast shadows are formed.",
      "content": "Understand how cast shadows are formed. Cast shadows are a second type that are familiar to us all. This type is dependent upon how the light strikes the object, time of day, and which direction the light is coming from. [2] X Research source Morning light comes from the east (left side of your paper) and is cool. Shadows might not be very pronounced at dawn. The noontime sun is directly overhead and is strong. Shadows will fall directly beneath the object. Afternoon light appears from the right side and is warm. Shadows can contain a hint of the color of the object casting them. Sunset often brings unexpected color to the sky."

      "content": "Study this example of a fall display at the entry of a food mart. The scene caught the artist's eye as inspiration for a possible painting. The focus of the scene is the pumpkins, with the flowers acting as a background. Certain elements, such as the brick wall and wooden structure behind the display, were left out. There were many more pumpkins than appear in this picture. The actual mum plants were much larger and many more of them surrounded the pumpkin. The artist included in the painting only what was needed to tell the story of the pumpkins. In this painting, the pumpkins are mostly the classic oval shape. They are varied slightly to create interest. Some pumpkins are behind others. They are not in rigid rows, but they are also not stacked, just put there in a casual way to welcome shoppers. Green stems point in all directions. There were no signs, but here, \"artistic license\" is employed, and a sign fills the top corner. The cast shadows make the pumpkins seem to be sitting on solid ground. The faint hint of a sidewalk shows that this is a city."

Do this by mixing yellow, red, and minute bits of blue to create new shades. Let your brush skip over the paper occasionally to leave white paper showing. This adds vitality and sparkle and is a hallmark of watercolor. Paint the stem and let it dry."
