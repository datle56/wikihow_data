Ringo will give you a deck for free and he will also give you instructions to the game. After that you can pick up extra cards by visiting merchants and looting corpses in the Wasteland. [1] X Research source Some quest givers will also give you cards, such as Festus who will give you cards if you beat him at lucky horseshoes."

Look at the options in the speech menu whenever you interact with an NPC to see if playing a game of Caravan is an option.

You can bet as much as you want on a game of Caravan, but you might want to start with low bets until you have figured it out. You won’t know what your hand is, but you may have an idea of your skill level and how difficult the NPC is to beat based on past experiences with playing them. NPCs can also raise your bet if they want, but they will not raise your bet by more than 50%. [3] X Research source For a low bet, try starting with 1 cap and see what your opponent raises you. If you don’t have any money to bet, you’ll need to go out and earn some before you can challenge someone to a game. Remember that you’ll lose the amount you bet if you lose the game, or win that amount if you win!"

Your goal is to build 3 caravans that have between 21 and 26 points from number cards in each one, so choose cards with this in mind. Kings, Queens, Jacks, and Jokers provide special effects that can help you to reach your goal and also thwart your opponent. Choose 30 cards from the bottom row and click the “Add” button to put them into your deck. [4] X Research source Do not use duplicate cards from the same deck. The interface in Fallout will automatically make cards unavailable if they are not useable. For example, you cannot use two 3’s of the same suit, but you could use a 3 of clubs and a 3 of hearts if you want. Likewise, if you have 2 kings, they would need to be of different suits to use them. [5] X Research source"

This is your beginning hand and you will need to arrange all 8 of these cards into caravans. Take turns with your opponent and put down 1 card at a time to fill each of your 3 caravans with cards from your hand. Line up these 3 stacks of cards so they are across from your opponents’ 3 stacks of cards. [8] X Research source The numbers in your caravans must be sequential in either ascending or descending order, but you can skip numbers. For example, you could start with a 2 of hearts in 1 caravan, then follow it with a 4 of spades, and then follow that with a 7 of clubs. [9] X Research source You may not discard during the opening rounds unless you have no cards at all to play. If you do not have any number cards or aces, show your hand to your opponent, shuffle your hand, and draw a new set of 8 cards. [10] X Research source"

Playing any card not equal to the card you play it on if here’s 1 number card on the caravan. Playing an ascending number or a descending number depending on the last 2 cards in the caravan."

Queen: Play it on the last card of a caravan to change its suit and reverse its direction. King: Double the value of the card you play it on.

For example, if your opponent has 2 caravans for sale at 22 points and 25 points, and you have 2 caravans for sale at 23 and 26 points, then you would be the winner. If you run out of cards before you can put a caravan up for sale, then your opponent automatically wins."
