      "content": "Drawing a diagram will help you visualize what you’re proving. The Intersecting Chords Theorem of Euclid states that given a point (P) in a circle and 2 chords (or lines) that pass through that circle (AD and BC), then ( A P ) ( D P ) = ( B P ) ( C P ) {\\displaystyle (AP)(DP)=(BP)(CP)} . Draw a circle and then mark A, B, C, D, and P. [1] X Research source P is typically in the middle of the circle, but slightly off-center. Both the A,B line and the C,D line will intersect that point."

      "content": "APB = CPD because they are opposite angles. Check out your triangles and identify all of the angles. By doing this, you can tell that A P B = C P D {\\displaystyle APB=CPD} because they’re opposite angles. [3] X Research source You can either measure all the angles by hand, or you can use the vertical angles theorem (when two straight lines intersect, they form two sets of linear pairs with congruent angles) to prove that ABP and CDP are the same. Then, you can use the inscribed angle theorem (an angle inscribed in a circle is half of the central angle that is on the same arc on the circle) to prove that angle A and angle C are equal. Finally, use the inscribed angle theorem again to prove that angle B and angle D are equal."
