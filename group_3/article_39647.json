      "content": "You don’t want to marry just anyone, and so maybe you won’t marry at all. There’s a lot to consider before getting married to someone, like your compatibility with your partner, their career, whether they want children, etc. Wanting someone who checks all the boxes isn’t a bad thing, it’s actually pretty prudent. [2] X Research source Of course, it could mean you’ll never find anyone who does pass every test, but maybe you’re better off without them, then."

      "title": "Marriage involves more promises than you’re comfortable making.",
      "content": "Marriage involves more promises than you’re comfortable making. You’re committing yourself to one person, and maybe even one way of life, for what might be the rest of your life. That’s a lot to ask someone, and for some people it’s too much. There are plenty of ways to express your affection and commitment to another person without making vows."

      "content": "You’ve seen too many marriages end poorly. Maybe your own parents got divorced, or you have friends whose relationships ended that way. Divorce is a common occurrence, and it’s a risk you have to consider. Maybe that’s a risk you’re more comfortable not taking. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "You think marriage is outdated or even a little pointless. And you’re not alone: more and more young people aren’t subscribing to what passes as “traditional” marriage. [5] X Research source You might find the whole deal outdated–signing a contract to be together with one person indefinitely might not align with your ideals, and you could be better off looking for alternative arrangements in your romantic relationships. Reader Poll: We asked 545 wikiHow readers what they think of marriage, and 72% of them said that marriage is important to them and they plan to get married one day. [Take Poll] It might feel like every single person around you plans to get married, and maybe it is the majority—but there are still many people who believe the same things as you (the stats prove it!)."

You might find your career fulfilling enough, or your hobbies or how you spend your time otherwise.

      "content": "Couples that cohabitate are less interested in getting married. There are a number of reasons this might be: one partner might not want to get married, and living with them influences the other partner’s own opinion in the same direction. Or, it could be that you and your partner are just comfortable living together without getting married, and so don’t feel the need to shake things up with a legally-binding contract. [7] X Research source Whatever the reason, your relationship is working already, so why mess with it?"

Marriage is just one of many ways to interact with and be close to people, and it’s not necessarily the best way. You might be someone who feels satisfied and fulfilled with your relationships with friends, family, and peers, and marriage doesn’t even need to factor into your social web. [11] X Research source"

[12] X Research source The subject of children can be a divisive one, and maybe one you’d rather not touch at all. Not wanting kids is a dealbreaker for a lot of potential partners, but it doesn’t have to mean you throw in the towel and get hitched. You can also be in a relationship without getting married or having kids–the best of both worlds! [13] X Research source"

When you make vows, there’s plenty to consider: what to do with your money, if you’ll have children, if you’ll be monogamous. You don’t have to worry about those questions when you’re single, and not worrying about is as good an answer as any.

Or maybe marriage just doesn’t fit with your own personality and interests, the way plenty of people have never considered taking up horseback riding. Whatever the reason, if marriage doesn’t seem to concern you, there’s probably no reason it should start concerning you now. [15] X Research source"

      "content": "You prefer to live alone and make your own rules. Most couples who take the vows move in together as part of the expectations that come with marriage, but you’re more comfortable going it alone. Not all couples cohabitate, and plenty of couples are perfectly happy commuting to each others’ homes rather than sharing a bathroom forever. [16] X Research source"

Many married people expect sex to be a regular component of their relationship, but your sexuality doesn’t factor sex into the picture at all.
