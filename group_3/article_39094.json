      "content": "Choose your fabric. Technically, you can use whatever fabric you want to create your kimono. However, lightweight fabrics will look best with this open and easy design. Try using a fabric like chiffon, silk, lightweight cotton, or a knit blend for the best results. You may choose a solid color or a print fabric for your kimono. Your fabric piece will need to measure 40” (107 cm) by 55” (140 cm). To save time, you might consider asking the store associate to cut your fabric to these exact dimension. If you cannot get this exact measurement from a fabric store, then measure and cut your piece to these dimensions when you get it home. This size fabric piece will create a kimono that falls around or just below your hips. If you want your kimono to be longer, then get a piece of fabric that is longer than 55” (140 cm), such as a 40” (107 cm) by 65” (165 cm) piece. The 40” size piece will result in sleeves that are about 3/4 length. If you want longer or short sleeves, then adjust the width of your fabric piece. For example, if you want longer sleeves, then you might go with a piece of fabric that is 48” (122 cm) by 55” (140 cm). [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Fold your fabric piece in half with the wrong side facing out.",
      "content": "Fold your fabric piece in half with the wrong side facing out. To get started, you will need to fold your fabric in half so that the 40” (107 cm) edges of your fabric are lined up evenly and the wrong sides (back side of the fabric) are facing out. Make sure that the edges are all evenly lined up. [2] X Research source Chiffon and silk are slippery fabrics, so you might find it helpful to pin the edges together in a few places. This will help to prevent the fabric from moving as you work."

Use a piece of chalk to mark the spot on the edge of your fabric that is 10” (25 cm) from the top fold. [3] X Research source You may make the first mark on either side of the fabric. You will be repeating the marking process on the opposite side after you make the first set of marks."

Mark this location with chalk as well. [4] X Research source If you have decided to make longer sleeves and have chosen a larger piece of fabric, then you will need to add to the length that you measure. For example, if you are using a piece of fabric that is 48\" (122 cm), then you might mark the fabric at 9\" (23 cm) in from the edge on each side instead."

Make sure that this line goes straight down from the 6” (15 cm) mark. [6] X Research source To ensure a straight line, measure 6” (15 cm) in from the outer edge at the bottom of the fabric and make a mark with your chalk.

After you finish making the first set of marks, you should have what looks like an upside down “L” shape on your kimono fabric. You will need to make another mark on the opposite side of your fabric to indicate where the other sleeve will be, so repeat the process on the opposite side of your folded fabric. When you are done, you should have two upside down chalk “L” shapes that are facing away from each other. [7] X Research source"

Cut slowly and carefully to ensure that your lines are straight and even. This will give your folded fabric the look of a kimono.

This line will indicate where the opening of your kimono will be. [8] X Research source Use a ruler or straight edge to draw the line. To ensure a straight line, you may want to measure and mark from the edge of your fabric to the center in a few places. Then, you can connect these marks into one long line that goes down the middle of your fabric."

Do not cut through both layers of fabric!"

You do not need to cut anything for the neckline, but you may cut two curved lines extending from about 2” (5 cm) below the top fold and running into the center line. To do this, mark the center line about 2” (5 cm) from the top fold and then draw a slightly curved line extending up towards the fold. Extend the curving line out from the center fold on both sides. This should look something like an ellipses or crescent moon shape. [10] X Research source The curved line should be about 3” (7.5 cm) long on either side of the central line. Keep in mind that creating this opening is optional, but it will result in a softer, more open neckline."

[11] X Research source However, other fabrics will require a hem to prevent fraying. After you have finished cutting your kimono fabric, pin along all of the raw edges to hem your kimono. Pin the fabric so that about ½” (1.3 cm) is folded over and so that the raw edges will be hidden on the wrong side of your fabric.

Go all the way around the bottom edges, and then sew up and around the kimono opening. Then, sew the edges of each of the sleeve openings to secure the hems here as well. Remove the pins as you sew."
