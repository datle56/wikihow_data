While you can purchase a commercial cleaner made for the appropriate material, you can also make your own: For leather upholstery: Make a paste of baking soda and water by mixing three parts baking soda to one part warm water. For vinyl, cloth, plastic, or carpeting: Mix eight parts warm water with one part white vinegar. Add about a half teaspoon (2.5 mL) dishwashing liquid and stir thoroughly."

If you are cleaning leather upholstery, make a paste by mixing 3 parts baking soda to one part warm (but not hot) water. If you are cleaning vinyl, cloth, plastic, or carpeting, mix together eight parts warm (but not hot) water with one part white vinegar. Add a half teaspoon (2.5 mL) dishwashing liquid and mix well."

For set-in stains, you should let the solution sit until it dries, then re-wet the stain with the solution a second time and let it sit for a few more minutes before scrubbing.

Some surfaces like vinyl or leather will be scratched by a hard bristled brush, so you'll need to use a sponge or soft-bristled brush. For surfaces like carpeting or cloth upholstery, use the firmest brush that will not damage the surface."

Baking soda is a classic stand-by for eliminating all kinds of nasty smells; it actually absorbs the smells and eliminates it. [2] X Research source You can use baking soda with a bit of essential oil mixed in to eliminate the smell of vomit from your car. Mix a few tablespoons of baking soda together with a few drops of your favorite essential oil. Any nice-smelling oil will do, but lemon or orange is especially good at eliminating smells. You can simply shake the baking soda and oil together in a plastic container with a lid. After cleaning up the vomit, moisten the spot and sprinkle the baking soda and essential oil mixture on top. Cover the surface of the area that had vomit on it, and let it sit for ten minutes. Then, use a vacuum with a hose attachment to vacuum up the baking soda."

You can try the type that hangs from your rearview mirror, the gel that sticks to your console, or a powder that you sprinkle on and vacuum up. Any of these can leave your car smelling nice and fresh."
