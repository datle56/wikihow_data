      "content": "Turn off all power to your trimmer. To safely replace the line on your power trimmer, it's important that it doesn't turn on while you work on it. Unplug the trimmer or remove the ion battery that came with it. This will ensure that you won't accidentally turn on the trimmer and injure yourself. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Sit the trimmer on a table or chair.",
      "content": "Sit the trimmer on a table or chair. To more easily work with your Black and Decker trimmer, set it on top of a table or a chair so that you don't have to bend over constantly to work with it. Choose a table or desk that comes up to your waist so you can easily replace the parts."

      "title": "Remove the cap on the trimmer head.",
      "content": "Remove the cap on the trimmer head. There will be a cap that covers your line on your Black and Decker trimmer. To remove this, use your fingers to press in the tabs that are on both sides of the cap. Once the tabs are pressed, simply lift up on the trimmer cap to remove it and expose the spool underneath."

      "title": "Pull the spool from the cap.",
      "content": "Pull the spool from the cap. Turn over your cap to reveal the line and spool. There will be two indentations or eyelets on the side of your cap that helps hold the line in place. Pull your line free from the holes on the cap, then grab onto the spool and carefully wiggle it free from the cap. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Remove the old line from the spool. To remove the old line, lift it from the eyelets that hold it in place and pull the free end of the line. This will result in removing the old string. Repeat the process on the other side of the spool to remove all of the old lines. [3] X Research source Wear gloves when working with your trimmer."

      "title": "Thread your new line into the holes designated on your spool.",
      "content": "Thread your new line into the holes designated on your spool. Purchase a .080 inch (2.0 mm) diameter round monofilament line from a hardware store. Do not use a serrated or heavier line because it can overload the motor and cause overheating. You can also buy pre-threaded spools from Black and Decker's website or at some hardware stores."

      "title": "Wind the line around the spool, following the arrows on the spool.",
      "content": "Wind the line around the spool, following the arrows on the spool. Feed the line through the hole and begin to wrap it around the spool. The more you overlap your spool, the more likely it is to get tangled when you start working with it. Instead, wrap the spool so that the line is wrapped next to itself, not over itself. Most Black and Decker models will have you wrap the string counter-clockwise."

      "title": "Secure the line to the spool and cut the line.",
      "content": "Secure the line to the spool and cut the line. Allow for 6 inches (15.24 cm) of slack on the end of your line after you're done wrapping it around the spool. Cut the thread with gardening shears or sharp scissors and put the excess line through the eyelets on the spool to hold them in place. [4] X Research source"
