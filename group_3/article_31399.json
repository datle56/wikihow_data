      "content": "Tell yourself that many girls are also shy around boys. One way to prepare yourself for talking to girls is to remember that it’s likely that the girls are just as scared about talking to you as you are about talking to them. They may look like they have it all figured out and may act like they’re not shy or nervous whatsoever, but on the inside, many girls are nervous about talking to boys, too. If you’re more aware of the fact that every girl or guy is shy about talking to people to some extent, then you’ll be less self-conscious about talking to girls. [1] X Research source While you’re worried about coming up with something to say next or wondering how you came off after your last comment, it’s likely that the girl you’re talking to is wondering the same thing about herself. Instead of being so worried about sounding smart, funny, or interesting, work on making the girl you’re talking to feel comfortable. It’s likely that she has the same worries as you do, and if you focus on making her comfortable, then you won’t be so worried about yourself."

      "content": "Just pretend that you’re talking to one of your friends. Sure, talking to the cute girl in your grade may seem completely different than chatting it up with your best friend, but if you stop being so worried about everything being perfect, you’ll see that it’s really not so different. You’ll have to come up with things to talk about, making the other person laugh, talk about something interesting you did over the weekend, and so on. Once you relax and stop trying to sound so impressive, you’ll be able to fall into a natural pace of conversation, just as you would with a close friend. Okay, so you and your best friends may have some inside jokes or a funny way of talking that may confuse a new girl you talk to. However, you can still talk about some of the same things and take a similar approach, working on having an interesting conversation instead of worrying about not having anything to talk about. Remember that, even when you talk to one of your friends, you may run out of things to talk about or repeat yourself or stumble on your words from time to time. It’s no big deal if that happens when you’re talking to a girl, either."

      "title": "Don’t worry about saying the perfect thing.",
      "content": "Don’t worry about saying the perfect thing. Guys who are shy about talking to girls tend to romanticize the situation and think that, when they talk to a cute girl, they have to say something absolutely perfect or astonishing to win her over, and then the two of you can walk off into the sunset together. In reality, if you tell the girl you like her shirt or talk about the Drake concert you just went to, you’ll be perfectly fine. Instead of searching for the perfect turn of phrase, just work on saying something to keep the conversation going. [2] X Research source If you’re too hung up on every word you say, then you’ll be much more likely to lapse into silence or to stumble on your words. Just keep talking and don’t overthink it and you’ll be much more impressive than if you say almost nothing for five minutes and then tell the perfect joke."

If you want to feel less shy about talking to girls, then one thing you can do is to come up with some ideas for things you could talk about in advance in case you run out of conversational material. In the moment, you may be too busy being in awe of the girl’s cuteness to come up with anything to say. So, make a quick mental list of just three or four things you could say to her before you start talking. This will make you feel more confident when you go into the conversation, even if it flows so naturally that you don’t end up saying them. [3] X Research source You can talk about what you did over the weekend, an awesome movie you both saw, your favorite band, what she did over the summer, or a class you both have together. You can also talk about a mutual friend, your plans for the evening, or something you just saw on the news. Remember that it takes two people to have a conversation. Even if you can’t think of another topic, the girl can think of things, too. You’re not doing a comedy routine. Try to find something that you have in common to talk about so you can both get involved in the conversation.

      "content": "Know that in the end, all you can do is be yourself. As corny as it sounds, if you really want to get to know a girl, then you don’t need to try to impress her with a suave version of who you really are. Sure, you can act a bit more polite and polished and make more of an effort to really capture her attention, but you shouldn’t go too far outside your comfort zone unless you plan on keeping the act up forever. [5] X Research source While you may not be as goofy as you are with your close friends right away, you don’t need to put up a fake persona of the guy you think the girl would rather talk to. If she’s standing in front of you having a conversation with you, then she wants to see and know who you really are."

You may want to talk about how awesome you are at soccer or to tell her all about your plans to be a doctor, but this kind of talk can actually turn some girls away. While you can talk about the things you love, there’s no need to brag. And even if you know how to juggle or do a backflip, this can come up naturally somehow, but you don’t need to show the girl how talented you are right on the spot. [6] X Research source If you really are skilled or talented in some way, the girl will realize it if you spend enough time together. In the beginning, though, you can let her figure it out instead of talking about how great you are. Girls like guys who project confidence, but not arrogance. You want to show that you’re happy with who you are without acting like you’re the greatest guy on the planet."

Here are some things you can do: [7] X Research source Count to thirty in your head before you approach the girl. This can help you feel more at ease. Focus on your breathing.

This will make you feel more at ease, because you’ll feel more comfortable while the girl gets to know you a bit, and it will also open the conversation up for her to share more about herself. You want her walking away from the conversation feeling like she’s learned something about you. If you start to feel shy when you talk about more personal topics, just make sure you stick to the topics you know and feel the most comfortable talking about, whether it’s sports or your dog, as long as they are interesting to her. If the girl asks you a question, try not to give her a “yes” or “no” answer but spend more time explaining what you mean, so she feels like you want to talk to her. Even if you’re feeling shy, just elaborating a bit can make the conversation flow better, and it will actually make you feel less shy."

If you can laugh at yourself or acknowledge when you said something silly, or even crack up when you trip while talking to the girl, that will actually make the conversation more fun because the girl won’t be so worried about keeping your ego intact.

For example, if you realize you’ve gotten so nervous that you’ve been talking about the Lakers for the last ten minutes, it’s okay to laugh and say, “Well, I think you know everything there is to know about the Lakers now, don’t you?” If you trip or misspeak, don’t act like it didn’t happen; just say, “There I go again” and move on.

If you’re really shy about talking to girls and spend a lot of time worrying about having the perfect conversation, then you should make sure that you leave on a good note so you can look forward to talking to the girl the next time. If you’ve said a few things to each other and it’s going well, instead of trying to keep that momentum up forever, you can eventually say that you have to get going and that you had a great time talking to her. This will boost your confidence when it comes to talking to the girl the next time around. If you wait until you’ve both run out of things to say and then say goodbye just because you’re out of ideas, this will make for a more awkward ending than if you leave just after you are both laughing and having an amazing time together.

Well, in reality, even the best conversations are filled with plenty of pauses, and it’s perfectly okay to have some of those when you talk to a girl. [15] X Research source The best thing you can do is to be comfortable with it instead of struggling to say something too soon. You don’t have to say “Well, this is awkward,” or make it even worse.

One of the reasons a lot of guys are shy about talking to girls is because they tend to idealize them, and to think that every girl they have a crush on or talk to is “the one,” or is this absolutely perfect, gorgeous person that they just have to be with forever.
