You can also combine apple types for a sweet / tart combo to make your applesauce more interesting. [1] X Trustworthy Source National Center for Home Food Preservation Publicly-funded center dedicated to educating consumers about research-backed safety practices for preserving food Go to source For tart, crisp apples, go for Granny Smith, Pink Lady, or Empire apples. For a sweeter variety, use Fuji, Gala, or Golden Delicious."

Obviously, the more apples you use, the more applesauce you’ll get. A general template for getting the amount of applesauce you want is: [2] X Research source 3 lb (1.4 kg) of apples = 1 US qt (0.95 L) of applesauce. 13.5 lb (6.1 kg) of apples = 9 US pt (4.3 L) of applesauce. 21 lb (9.5 kg) of apples = 7 US qt (6.6 L) of applesauce."

If you would like your applesauce extra sweet, you can add in sugar 1/4 cup (32 g) at a time until you feel like it’s enough. It’s all up to you, so don’t be afraid to play around with it! [3] X Research source Honey and maple syrup are also great natural sweeteners you can add in a little bit at a time. If you’re using a lot of sweet apples, you probably don’t need to use that much sugar."

If you want to mix it up a bit, add 4 tsp (16 g) of cinnamon, nutmeg, or allspice once your apples are all mashed up. [4] X Research source You can also add a bit of all 3 spices together if you’re going for a super autumnal flavor."

If you want to keep your applesauce looking fresh, add 4 tablespoons (59 mL) of lemon juice when you add in the sugar to your recipe. You’ll preserve the color of your apples and give your applesauce a citrus tang. [5] X Research source Again, this is optional, so you can experiment with adding or not adding lemon juice."

If you want to keep it around for years to come, go for canning the applesauce in jars. If you’d like to save it for up to 10 months, you can freeze your applesauce. If you plan on eating it relatively quickly, just store it in the fridge instead. [6] X Trustworthy Source Penn State Extension Educational organization dedicated to delivering science-based information to people, businesses, and communities Go to source Canning applesauce takes more time than freezing it, and there’s more risk of bacteria.

Use a melon baller or a knife to cut out the core and remove the seeds and the stem so you don’t get anything crunchy in your applesauce. [7] X Research source You can throw out the stems and the seeds or put them in your compost pile.

They don’t have to look perfect, but they should all be about the same size so they cook evenly.

Put them in a large pot and bring it to a boil, then set a timer for 12 to 15 minutes. Keep an eye on the pot so it doesn’t boil over as your apples get soft.
