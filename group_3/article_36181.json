      "title": "Soak your feet",
      "content": "Soak your feet in warm water and scrub. One of the most basic solutions is to soak feet for long enough to soften the dead skin and scrub it off with a pumice stone or foot brush. Fill a foot bath or small tub with enough water to cover the tops of your feet and soak for 20 minutes. Gently scrub the dead skin off of your feet. [1] X Research source This is most effective for broad, shallow calluses , like the ones that form on the heel of your feet. [2] X Expert Source Mark Co, DPM Podiatrist Expert Interview. 21 April 2020. This is best done gently because you don’t want to expose too much raw skin or your feet will hurt. Scrub a little off at a time and repeat over the course of a few days. Thickened skin is often due to calluses from pressure or friction on your feet, but shaving it down will prevent that callus from hurting the skin underneath.

      "content": "Prepare a lemon juice soak. In a small plastic tub, pour enough lemon juice to cover the bottoms of your feet. If you don’t have enough lemon juice for this, it is okay to dilute with an equal amount of warm water. Soak for ten minutes then rinse and pat dry. [4] X Research source Undiluted lemon juice will give your feet a stronger treatment than if you dilute it with water. Make sure you don’t have any cuts or open sores on your feet as the acid in lemon juice will cause extreme burning in those areas."

      "content": "Make an Epsom salt foot bath . Fill a foot bath, or small plastic container, half-full with warm to slightly hot water. Add a half cup (118.3 ml) of Epsom salt to the water. Soak feet for 10 minutes. Gently rub with a pumice stone to remove dead skin that the soak has loosened. [5] X Research source The works best if you repeat it every two to three days to avoid feet becoming dry again. It may take a few days of soaks to notice a big difference in the skin on your feet."

      "title": "Harness the power of vinegar.",
      "content": "Harness the power of vinegar. The acidic nature of both white vinegar and apple cider vinegar makes them great for removing dead skin. In a foot bath, or small plastic tub, mix equal parts vinegar and mild hot water. For the best results, soak feet for around 45 minutes and gently rub with a pumice afterward. [6] X Research source Another way to use this solution is to soak your feet in the vinegar and water mixture for about five minutes and then soak in pure apple cider vinegar for 15 minutes. This makes for a stronger soak than diluted vinegar."

      "content": "Mash a banana and rub it on your feet. Make sure you use bananas that are as ripe as possible , almost to the point of being too ripe to eat. Place one or two bananas in a bowl. Use a fork or masher to mash then into a smooth paste. Apply to feet and leave it for about 20 minutes. Then rinse your feet clean. [7] X Research source Make sure you keep your feet off of the ground and furniture. Try propping them up on a footrest for the duration. It might also be smart to have a small tub of water handy so you can easily wash them off when you are done."

      "content": "Apply a crushed aspirin mixture to your feet. Crush 5-6 non-coated aspirin with a mortar and pestle , if you have one, or in a small zip style bag with the back of a spoon.

[8] X Research source The mixture may want to run off of your feet, so consider wrapping a warm towel around each foot to help keep the mixture in place. Once your feet are rinsed clean, you can gently buff each foot with a pumice stone for dead skin removal."

      "title": "Coat each foot in paraffin wax.",
      "content": "Coat each foot in paraffin wax . Paraffin wax is often used in beauty products to moisturize skin. Heat some in a microwave-safe bowl. Once heated, carefully pour onto a plate, or pan, large enough to fit your foot on. Gently place each foot into the wax. Allow wax to stiffen and place a sock on each foot. Leave it on your feet for the night and peel it off in the morning. [9] X Research source The exact amount needed may vary depending on the size of your feet. Start with about ½ cup (118.3 ml) and if this ends up not being enough, use a little more the next time. When you peel the wax off in the morning, throw it away in the trash. Try to keep it from falling onto the carpet. You can purchase socks that are specifically made for this type of overnight treatment if you don’t want to get wax on your regular socks."

Gently massage this mixture onto your feet before bed and wear socks to keep it from rubbing off on the sheets. [10] X Research source For repeated treatments, you may want to designate one or two pairs of socks that are specifically for this purpose. You can also substitute lemon juice, because both have acidic properties that help remove dead skin."

Apply this mixture to your feet and wear socks to bed. Rinse off in the morning. [11] X Research source This process can be done on a weekly basis, or a couple of times a week, to slowly remove dead skin and make your feet softer. If you don’t have a blender, you could crush the oatmeal and almonds in a plastic bag with a mallet. You can do whatever works to get them as close to powder as possible."
