      "title": "Get a stack of index cards.",
      "content": "Get a stack of index cards. You will need one for as many perfect squares you want to memorize. Start simple with 10 cards, then add another 10 as your memory improves."

      "title": "Write the root numbers on the front of the card.",
      "content": "Write the root numbers on the front of the card. Make the numbers large enough to read from a few feet away. This will be the side of the card you are shown."

      "title": "Write the squared number on the back of the card.",
      "content": "Write the squared number on the back of the card. This will be the answer of the card. Make sure the card is thick enough that you can’t see the answers through the paper."
    },
    {
      "title": "Go through the cards.",
      "content": "Go through the cards. Look at the root number and state the corresponding squared number. You can do this alone or get a friend to go through the cards with you. Try and get through the deck as quickly as possible."

    {
      "title": "Repeat.",
      "content": "Repeat. Go through your flashcards a few times a day and you will getting through them gets easier every time. Eventually you will be able to recite your perfect squares without the use of the flashcards at all."

      "title": "Locate a piece of graph paper.",
      "content": "Locate a piece of graph paper. Graph paper has printed lines that appear vertically and horizontally across the page. The result is that the page looks like a grid with many boxes on the page. Solving the perfect squares by using shapes can help you picture the problem visually and further your understanding. If you struggle with working with numbers on a page, you might find this method is more helpful to train your brain."

      "title": "Trace a box around the existing lines of the graph paper.",
      "content": "Trace a box around the existing lines of the graph paper. Make a box that goes around several boxes on the graph paper. Just make sure the box is square in shape, with an equal number of grids on each side. Write the number of graph squares of any given side above the box you've traced. This will be the root number you are going to square. For example, draw a box that is 3 squares long by 3 squares wide."

      "title": "Number the squares of the graph paper inside of the box you have drawn.",
      "content": "Number the squares of the graph paper inside of the box you have drawn. Number from left to right, then top to bottom. When you have filled all the squares, you have your answer. The highest number is the square of your root number. [1] X Research source Number all the boxes in your 3-by-3 box shape. The highest number will be 9. So, 3²=9."

Competition will help to keep yourself motivated to improve your knowledge and math skills. If they are doing better than you, you might be able to get some insight on what methods have worked for them."
