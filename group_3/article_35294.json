      "content": "Read a full psalm if you’re looking for a beautiful, poetic option. Psalms are great choices if you want to read a longer passage that can stand on its own, and their poetic language is sure to comfort those who are grieving.

He maketh me to lie down in green pastures: he leadeth me beside the still waters. He restoreth my soul: he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake. Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me. Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies: thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over. Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life: and I will dwell in the house of the Lord for ever. [8] X Research source"

Miss me a little, but not for long And not with your head bowed low Remember the love that once we shared Miss me, but let me go. For this is a journey we all must take And each must go alone. It's all part of the master plan A step on the road to home. When you are lonely and sick at heart Go to the friends we know. Laugh at all the things we used to do Miss me, but let me go.

      "content": "“When Great Trees Fall,” by Maya Angelou This excerpt by Maya Angelou (1928-2014) serves as a reminder that peace eventually comes after grief. The poem talks about \"great trees\" falling, and very large trees like oaks and redwoods are known for being hundreds of years old. [13] X Research source Because of this, it's an excellent choice to honor a grandparent or an elder, whose many years of life make them as commanding and wise as these old trees. And when great souls die, after a period peace blooms, slowly and always irregularly. Spaces fill with a kind of soothing electric vibration. Our senses, restored, never to be the same, whisper to us. They existed. They existed. We can be. Be and be better. For they existed. [14] X Research source"

      "content": "Excerpts from the novels Tuesdays With Morrie and Fahrenheit 451 If you would rather read prose than poetry, these two quotes from novels are excellent options. Both discuss the powerful effect our loved ones leave behind. They serve as beautiful reminders that the people we care about are always with us, even after they’ve passed away. “As long as we can love each other, and remember the feeling of love we had, we can die without ever really going away. All the love you created is still there. All the memories are still there. You live on—in the hearts of everyone you have touched and nurtured while you were here.”— Mitch Albom, Tuesdays with Morrie [20] X Research source “Everyone must leave something behind when he dies, my grandfather said. A child or a book or a painting or a house or a wall built or a pair of shoes made. Or a garden planted. Something your hand touched some way so your soul has somewhere to go when you die, and when people look at that tree or that flower you planted, you're there.”— Ray Bradbury, Fahrenheit 451"
