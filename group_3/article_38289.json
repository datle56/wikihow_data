Use the preview to decide on the type of format, orientation and resolution before continuing. \"Orientation\" allows the user to select portrait or landscape and \"Resolution\" determines the sharpness of the image. A higher resolution will make the details of the picture more noticeable. To make a sharper image, increase the resolution. Note: This will also increase the size of the image, and dramatically increase the size of the file. You may not be able to send it as an email attachment without making it smaller. Above 300 dpi is unnecessary."
