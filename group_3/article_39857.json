You’ll also want to be able to brush your teeth and remove any makeup if you wear it. [1] X Research source See what you can fit in whatever bag you usually carry with you. If you normally carry a very small clutch or wallet, you’ll need to bring something slightly bigger or only pack the bare essentials. If your boyfriend lives far away and this is part of an overnight trip to visit him you can get away with packing a lot more. After all, you’ll need everything you would regularly travel with."

You probably don’t want to get into the awkward situation of having to ask to borrow a toothbrush, but simply choosing not to brush your teeth can be awkward too. Pack anything that you simply can’t live without. [2] X Research source You may want to bring makeup remover if you wear makeup. Some women would rather go to bed with their makeup on than have their boyfriends see them without it. However, this can be bad for your skin, and if he’s your boyfriend he’s going to see you without makeup eventually. Pack anything you’ll need for dealing with your hair. Some women need to tie their hair into a rag at night but choose not to when they stay with a boyfriend. Of course you’re not going to put your hair up in curlers on this special night, but maybe you want to pack a brush, comb, or detangling spray."

Bring your own. If you're not sure whether or not you'll be having intercourse, bring some along just in case. [4] X Research source Condoms are the only birth control method that also protects against sexually transmitted infections. Bringing lube or any other sexual accessories you like can be a good idea, too."

If you went over to his house in a very confining outfit or something only appropriate for a late-night date, you’ll probably feel uncomfortable walking around the park the next morning or grabbing a casual breakfast in that.

Don’t assume that just because you’re sleeping over for the first time you’re obligated to have sex. However, if that’s what you’re hoping for, plan for it. Having sex can be a way of bringing you two closer together and forming an even more intimate bond. Sex can also bring up tricky issues such as questions about monogamy, sexual history, sexual health, and potential pregnancy. If you’re not up for talking about these things with your guy, you may not be ready for the responsibility of being sexually active with him.

If you aren’t ready to make a decision right now, that’s okay. Just make sure that you’re able to make a fully informed and consensual decision in the moment if sex comes up."

There are a number of ways you can ask about your boyfriend’s expectations while still being charming and even flirtatious. [7] X Research source If you want to keep the conversation flirty, you can ask what the sleeping arrangements will be. Say something like, “So, do you think we’ll be sharing a bed or should I bring my own sleeping bag?” If you want to be more direct, you can say something like, “I know we’ve never had a sleepover before. I’m really excited, but I’d also like to talk about each of our expectations for the night. I’m wondering how you feel about sex and if you think we’re ready.” If you already know exactly what you want and feel certain about it, you can simply start with that. Say something like, “Hey, I’m really excited to sleep over, but I want you to know ahead of time that I am not ready to have sex with you” or, “I’m so excited to stay over at your house tonight. I feel really ready to take things to the next level with sex.”"

Not only that, he’s surely just as nervous as you. Take some of the pressure off by relaxing together and doing things you normally enjoy together. [8] X Research source Your boyfriend is probably nervous about you seeing what his house and room look like. Put him at ease by letting him know anything you like or appreciate about his living space. You can say something like, “I really like that poster you’ve got on the wall,” or, “Wow, this is a great location you’ve got.” If his place isn’t that great to hang out in, you can go for a walk or a drive. Take your date elsewhere and come back just to sleep."

If you end up having sex or being physically intimate in other ways, you may feel comfortable sleeping with nothing on at all, or sleeping in only your underwear. If he lives with his family, you’ll want to sleep in something conservative in case a parent or sibling barges in or you need to go to the bathroom in the middle of the night.

You can say something like, “Do you want to make breakfast together?” or, “I’d love a cup of coffee. Is there a good place nearby?” Does one of you have to go to work or school? If you do, let him know. You can say something like, “I have to be at work in an hour, but I’d be happy to have a quick coffee together, if you want.” You can also say, “Do you have plans for the day? I’m free, but I understand if you’ve got things to do.” Of course, your boyfriend should care for you and have lots of respect for you, so don’t feel shy about letting him know if you do or don’t want to spend the morning together.

Avoid displaying too much affection in front of his family. You can of course be sweet to each other, but avoid kissing or petting each other in front of family. Dress modestly for sleep and around the house. Don't get up to go to the bathroom in a T-shirt and underwear, for example."
