      "content": "Say \"secundaria\" when you are referring to school grades 7-10, in Mexico. Determine the age level(s) of schooling to which you are referring. In the United States, high school refers to a compulsory education for students ages fourteen through eighteen. However, this is not the case in many Spanish speaking countries. Schooling is broken up differently in other countries. In Mexico, if you are referring to students age twelve to fifteen, students attend what is comparable to junior high school. This school is called \"secundaria\", and it is an extension of \"educación básica\" (elementary school). If you want more information about high school in Mexico, there are some government websites which provide information about \"secundaria\" in Mexico. These websites can be written in language that is difficult to read. However, if you read slowly and skim for graphs and visual representations, you can find some useful information."

      "content": "Say \"preparatoria\" or \"bachillerato\" when talking about school grades 10-12, in Mexico. Students ages fifteen to eighteen attend what is called \"preparatoria\", \"bachillerato\", or \"educación media superior\". In Mexico, \"el bachillerato\" is the main track to university. \"Prepartoria\", on the other hand, is more geared toward vocational training so that when a student graduates they are ready to work in a specific vocation. For example, students who graduate from \"prepartoria\" might be ready to work as a laboratory technician."

      "content": "Call school grades 7-11 \"instituto\", when referring to Spain. In Spain, students twelve to sixteen years of age attend either an \"instituto de educación secundaria\" (instituto for short), \"colegio concertado\", or \"colegio privado\". Schooling at this point is still compulsory. Some high schools are public, others are private, and some are both. In Chile, for example, there has been a major shift toward the privatization schools. Most parents will pay more for their students to attend the private or semi-private schools. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Call school grades 11 to college, \"bachillerato\" or \"ciclos formativos\", for Spain.",
      "content": "Call school grades 11 to college, \"bachillerato\" or \"ciclos formativos\", for Spain. At this point, schooling is not compulsory for all students. However, many students sixteen to eighteen years of age attend \"bachillerato\" or go to \"ciclos formativos\" for more school training. Often the different high schools in Spanish speaking countries entail different kinds of training. Different kinds of schools determine the career path their students take. For example, in Spain \"el bachillerato\" is the school that is on track to university. In \"el bachillerato\" studies students earn a certificate that is mandatory to attend university. Students also prepare for their \"Prueba de Acceso a la Universidad\", or university admittance exam, which they must take for university admittance. The other track students take in high school is Ciclos Formativos. This program is through Spain's \"institutos\", and it consists of vocational training. When most students leave these programs they are ready to work as a hairdressers, technicians etc."

      "content": "Use proper grammar. When you are talking about high school in Spanish, the grammar can take several different forms. Find out what you want to say, and check to make sure you are using the correct grammar. If you are talking about a building or institution, high school is a noun and should be preceded by \"la\" or \"el\". If you are referring to a high school student, use the adjective form. In the adjective form, high school is preceded by \"de\". For example, you say, \"un estudiante de escuela secundaria.\" As you can see, when you translate high school student from English to Spanish, the words \"high school\" and \"student\" are switched."

      "title": "Know the noun's gender.",
      "content": "Know the noun's gender. Words in Spanish have male and female genders. If a word ends in 'o' or 'e', it is most likely masculine and is preceded by \"el\". If a word ends in a, d, z or ión, it is most likely feminine and is preceded by \"la\". For example, if you are saying \"the high school (in Ecuador) needs more students\", you would say, \"se necesitan más estudiantes para el colegio.\" \"Colegio' is preceded by \"el\", because the word colegio is masculine. For example, if you say \"I am studying English in high school (in Chile)\", you would say, \"estoy estudiando inglés en la enseñanza media\". The term enseñanza media is feminine, so it is preceded by \"la\"."
