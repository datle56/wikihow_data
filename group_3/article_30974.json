      "content": "Squeeze the amount of blue paint you will need for your project onto your palette. Make sure that you have enough paint to complete the coverage needed with this shade of dark blue. Once you have mixed the perfect hue, it could be difficult to match this shade a second time. It’s always better to make more dark blue than you need rather than run out. [2] X Research source If you do not complete your project, you can store your excess paint in an airtight container like a plastic container you would use to store leftover food. Consider wetting a paper towel or sponge and placing it in the bottom of your container, or using a Sta-Wet Palette to keep your paint from drying out."

      "content": "Place a small amount of black paint next to the blue paint on your palette. Avoid putting the black paint directly on top of the blue paint. Placing it next to the blue will allow you to add a little black at a time and give you more control over the shade."

      "content": "Mix the black into the blue paint a little at a time. Fold the colors together using a mixing tool or cross-hatch strokes with your paint brush. You don't need to mix too thoroughly, which could dull the color. Just combine the paint enough to assess the shade."

      "title": "Add more black paint and mix as necessary until you reach your desired shade of blue.",
      "content": "Add more black paint and mix as necessary until you reach your desired shade of blue. This could take several repetitions of adding black to the blue paint, but continue to use small amounts so you don't exceed the level of darkness you wish to create. If you accidentally mix too much black into the blue, have some extra blue paint on hand to even out the ratio."

There are basic color wheels which use only the primary and secondary colors. Consider using an advanced wheel which includes various tints, hues and shades."

      "content": "Find the exact placement on the color wheel of the specific hue of blue paint you are beginning with. In order to identify the complementary color, you need to start with the exact placement of your blue paint on the color wheel. Don’t judge the hue based on the title of the paint. Rather, apply the paint to a small bit of white paper and allow it to dry. Compare this color to the color wheel and match the hue to the most accurate section of the wheel."

      "content": "Identify the shade of orange which is complementary to your shade of blue. A complementary color is the color directly across the wheel from the blue you have identified. This should be some version of orange and is the color you will mix with your blue to darken it. A good place to start would be mixing Burnt Sienna with Ultramarine Blue. Another possible color combination is Cadmium Orange and Cobalt Blue."

It is better to have too much paint than too little in order to avoid having to mix more and attempt to match your shade a second time. It is a good idea to save some of your blue paint in case you add too much orange and need to adjust the shade by adding blue back into your mixture."

If the orange exceeds blue, you will be moving away from dark blue and blend into a shade of orange.

Acrylics dry quickly, so you can easily test your paint color by painting a small amount on your canvas and allowing it to dry. This should take no longer than 15 minutes, and will allow you to see the ultimate color before you use this shade for your project. [6] X Research source If you are unhappy with the dried color, go back to your palette and adjust it by adding more blue or purple accordingly."
