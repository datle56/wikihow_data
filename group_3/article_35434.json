      "content": "Pain in the lower right abdomen, fever, nausea, or decreased appetite The most common symptom of appendicitis is dull, persistent abdominal pain near the belly button that radiates or changes near the right lower belly. If you feel this discomfort, especially in addition to other symptoms, contact your doctor or go to the hospital as soon as you can. Delaying diagnosis will only make your appendix more likely to rupture and will endanger your life. You'll usually notice symptoms within 12 to 18 hours, but they may last up to a week, becoming more severe as time goes on. [2] X Trustworthy Source Johns Hopkins Medicine Official resource database of the world-leading Johns Hopkins Hospital Go to source Other symptoms include: Decreased appetite Stomach problems like nausea, diarrhea, and constipation (especially if paired with frequent vomiting) [3] X Research source A fever at or over 103°F (40°C). Go to a hospital immediately if your fever is this high, or if it's at 102°F (38°C) but you're experiencing several other symptoms. A low grade fever of around 99°F (37°C) Chills and shaking Back pain Inability to pass gas or feeling bloated The feeling that you need a bowel movement, even if your bowels are empty (known as tenesmus) If your pain comes and goes, you may have appendiceal colic, where severe cramping of the abdomen is caused by spasms or contractions of the appendix. The condition may eventually result in acute appendicitis. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Pain that moves from your navel to your appendix In most adults, your appendix is located on the lower right side of your abdomen (usually one third of the way between your belly button and hip bone). Watch for a “path” of sharp pain—it might move from your navel (belly button) to the area directly over your appendix 12 to 24 hours after you start experiencing symptoms. If you've noticed a distinct progression like this, go straight to the emergency room. [6] X Trustworthy Source Cedars Sinai Hospital Website of one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source In adults, symptoms of appendicitis may get worse after as little as 4 hours. If you're diagnosed with appendicitis, it is considered a medical emergency. Note that the location of your appendix may be different for pregnant women."

      "title": "Vague abdominal pain (kids under 10, pregnant women, women over 50)",
      "content": "Vague abdominal pain (kids under 10, pregnant women, women over 50) It may be harder to detect appendicitis in pregnant women —the pain might be less severe and located higher in the abdomen because the appendix is displaced during pregnancy. In young children, the pain in the abdomen may be lower and accompanied by vomiting and/or swelling of the belly. Toddlers with appendicitis sometimes have trouble eating and may seem unusually sleepy (they may refuse to eat even their favorite snacks). [7] X Research source In older children, pain typically starts at the belly button and moves to the lower right quadrant of the belly (like in adults). Pain does not get better if the child lies down, but may get worse if the child moves. A very high fever in a child could be a sign that the appendix is about to burst (or already has). Women over 50 may also experience vague or displaced abdominal pain, but this is rare. Typically, they will feel pain in the lower right abdomen like most adults."

      "content": "Press on your abdomen to see if it’s painful to the touch. If it's too painful for you to even touch, especially in the lower right portion, consider going to the emergency room. Check yourself for rebound tenderness as well—press on your lower right abdomen and then quickly release your hand. If you feel a sharp pain, you may have appendicitis and need urgent medical attention. [8] X Research source You may also feel a vague tenderness in your lower abdomen when you press on it. The most painful spot on your abdomen during appendicitis is called McBurney’s Point. It’s about two-thirds the distance from the navel to the bony projection of your right hip bone."

      "title": "Poke your abdomen and note any firmness.",
      "content": "Poke your abdomen and note any firmness. When you press on your abdomen, is your finger able to sink in a bit? Or does your abdomen feel unusually firm and hard? If you notice the latter, you might be severely bloated, which is another symptom of appendicitis. [9] X Research source Firmness or a hard mass in your abdomen may be a sign of peritonitis (an infection caused by a burst appendix). Visit the ER right away if the firmness is accompanied by pain. If you have abdominal pain, but don't have nausea or decreased appetite, it may not be appendicitis. There are many reasons for abdominal pain that don't need a visit to the emergency room. When in doubt, call or see your regular doctor for any abdominal pain that lasts more than 3 days."

You'll then be ranked on a list of patients who need care according to the immediacy of their injuries. [13] X Research source If you have time or aren’t incapacitated by pain, write down a quick summary of your symptoms and any medications you take and request copies be included in all reports during your visit. Don't panic if you have to wait—you're a lot safer at the hospital than at home. Try to be patient and take your mind off the pain by distracting yourself with a book or your phone, or conversing with any friends or family who accompanied you. [14] X Research source"

[15] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Expect your abdomen to be prodded. The doctor will press hard on your lower abdomen to check for peritonitis (the infection that results from a burst appendix).

      "content": "Expect additional lab tests. Lab testing and imaging are important for the official diagnosis of appendicitis, since physical exams cannot show what’s happening inside your body. Lab testing is often painless and doesn’t require any preparation unless you’re instructed not to eat or drink prior to an imaging test. Possible tests include: [16] X Trustworthy Source MedlinePlus Collection of medical information sourced from the US National Library of Medicine Go to source Blood test: This will identify a high white blood cell count, which signifies an infection (even before a low-grade temperature is seen). The blood test will also show if there is an imbalance of electrolytes or dehydration, which can cause pain as well. The doctor may also run a pregnancy test for women. Urinalysis: A urine test will show a possible urinary tract infection or kidney stone, which may also present with appendicitis-like abdominal pain at times. Ultrasound: An ultrasound of the abdomen will show if there is a blockage, rupture, or swelling of the appendix (or another reason for the abdominal pain). Ultrasounds are usually the first resort for imaging. MRI: MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) tests are used to get a more detailed picture of the internal organs without using an x-ray. It will show the same signs as an ultrasound, but in more detail. Expect to feel slightly claustrophobic in the MRI machine. Your physician may order light sedation to help ease the anxiety. CT Scan: CT (computed tomography) scans use an x-ray with computer technology to show images. You may be given a solution to drink that will “dye” your veins for better imaging. This test will show signs of inflammation, bursting, or blockage of the appendix."

Avoid the following over-the-counter medications or pain management techniques: [17] X Trustworthy Source Johns Hopkins Medicine Official resource database of the world-leading Johns Hopkins Hospital Go to source Pain medication: Pain medication can make it harder for you to monitor and track any spikes in abdominal pain. [18] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Medical School Harvard Medical School's Educational Site for the Public Go to source Laxatives: Laxatives might irritate your intestines further and cause more discomfort or pain. Antacids: Antacids can worsen pain associated with appendicitis. Heating pads: Heating pads might cause an inflamed appendix to rupture. Food or drink: Don't eat or drink anything until you've been examined, because this can make you a higher risk for aspiration during surgery."

      "content": "Get an appendectomy to remove an infected appendix. If your doctor determines that you do have appendicitis, the only cure is to remove the appendix in a surgery called an appendectomy. Most surgeons prefer a laparoscopic procedure, which is minimally invasive and leaves less of a scar than an open appendectomy. [19] X Trustworthy Source Johns Hopkins Medicine Official resource database of the world-leading Johns Hopkins Hospital Go to source If your doctor does not think you need surgery, they may send you home to be “on watch” for 12 to 24 hours. During that time, do not take antibiotics, pain medicine, or laxatives, and contact your provider if you get worse. When you return, make sure not to eat or drink anything in advance because this could cause complications in surgery. Appendectomies are safe, commonplace procedures with low complication rates if they’re performed before the appendix ruptures. If the appendix has burst, the risk of complications is about 25%.

Modern appendectomies are minimally invasive, and you’re likely to leave the hospital in 1-2 days and return to normal life with few to no complications within 2-4 weeks. However, surgery is taxing no matter how successful the procedure is, so follow your provider’s post-operation recovery regimen closely. [21] X Research source Wait 24 hours before eating or drinking anything. Your doctor will tell you when you can have small amounts of liquids, then solid foods. Rest and recover for the first 24 hours. Try to engage in light activity and movement, like walking, over the following few days and avoid strenuous lifting or high-impact activities, like running. Take any prescribed antibiotics. If your appendix burst before surgery, you will likely be given an oral or intravenous antibiotic to take during recovery to prevent infection. [22] X Research source Call your doctor if you notice problems including pain, vomiting, dizziness, faintness, fever, diarrhea, bloody urine or stool, constipation, drainage or swelling around the incision site, or lingering symptoms of appendicitis."
