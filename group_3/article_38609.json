      "content": "Analyze the weaknesses of your opponents. Each member of the Elite Four specializes in a certain Pokémon type. Aaron prioritizes Bug type, Bertha prefers Ground type, Flint likes Fire type, and Lucian excels in Psychic type. Since you cannot change lineups between fights with the Elite Four, you will need to bring a powerful, but diverse lineup."

      "content": "Pick a Flying or Fire type to fight Aaron. Unfortunately, no single Pokémon fits both so you’ll have to pick one. If you started the game with Chimchar, his evolved form will take you through the bulk of the fight. Here is a list of Aaron’s Pokémon and their potential weaknesses: Dustox: Bug/Poison. Weak to Flying, Ground, Rock, Fire, or Psychic Heracross: Bug/Fight. Weak to Flying [4x Effectiveness], Fire, Psychic Vespiquen: Bug/Flying.

Strong dark attacks can work through this fight very quickly. A Spiritomb will do very well, but there are many options. Mr. Mime: Psychic. Weak to Bug, Dark, Ghost Girafarig: Normal/Psychic. Weak to Bug, Dark Medicham: Psychic/Fight. Weak to Flying, Ghost Alakazam: Psychic. Weak to Bug, Dark, Ghost Bronzong: Steel/Psychic. Weak to Fire, Ground Note: Bronzong will have the ability Levitate (causes user to be unaffected by ground types)"

Otherwise fill in the gaps from your choices for the Elite Four to create a well rounded team. Spiritomb: Ghost/Dark. No weaknesses. Just don't use any normal moves. Garchomp: Dragon/Ground. Weak to Ice [4x Effectiveness], Dragon Gastrodon: Water/Ground. Weak to Grass [4x Effectiveness] Milotic: Water. Weak to Grass, Electric Roserade: Grass/Poison.

Moves like Surf, Thunderbolt, Ice Beam, Flamethrower, and Earthquake can be super effective against the Elite Four's Pokémon when used in the correct situation. They can also give your Pokémon more diverse attack type options. Moves that cause status effects (Toxic, Thunder Wave, and Sleep Powder) as well as moves that raise your Attack and/or Speed (Swords Dance and Dragon Dance) can also be very helpful."

      "content": "Assemble your team. Unique Pokémon like Palkia or Dialga will always be a strong choice, but if you don’t have access to them or don’t want to use them for a challenge, there are many options for a well rounded team. Sensible switching to exploit differences in the fight will be key. Good luck!"
