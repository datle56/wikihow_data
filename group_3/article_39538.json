      "content": "Run a hot water wash cycle. Put your windbreaker in the washing machine by itself. You don’t need to add detergent unless you want to wash the garment—it is the heat of the water that will cause shrinkage. Adjust the settings to use the hottest water and run for the longest amount of time in order to shrink the fabric. [2] X Research source To prevent the colors of your windbreaker from fading, you can add 1 ⁄ 2 cup (120 mL) of ammonia to the washer. Always wash polyester at 60 °F (16 °C) or higher.

Then, let your windbreaker cool before removing it from the dryer. [5] X Research source If your windbreaker hasn’t shrunk enough, you could repeat the process.

Read online reviews or ask friends, family members, and coworkers if they can recommend a good tailor rather than choosing the first listing you see. Then, call and set up an appointment to get your windbreaker altered. [6] X Research source Look for an established company with experience tailoring all types of fabrics and garments. When you make your appointment, explain that you want to get a windbreaker altered to ensure that the tailor is comfortable working with the fabric of the garment and making the adjustments you want."

In most cases, they’ll be able to shorten the sleeves and hem as well as take in the jacket to make it smaller, though it will depend on the type of fabric and the construction of the garment.

The cost of the alterations depends on where you live, how much experience the tailor has, and how difficult the garment is to alter. In general, shortening the sleeves may cost $15-$40, taking in the jacket can cost $20-$50, and shortening the hem might run you $30-$40.
