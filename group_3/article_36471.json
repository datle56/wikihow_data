      "content": "Use toothpaste, Polywatch paste , or Brasso polish on an acrylic crystal. If your watch is inexpensive, it most likely has an acrylic crystal, sometimes referred to as plastic or Hesalite. It’s also likely your watch has an acrylic crystal if it was manufactured before the 1980s. If the watch crystal looks plastic-like or is extremely lightweight, it is probably acrylic. If you use toothpaste, make sure it is not grainy, as this can scratch the watch crystal."

      "title": "Use any type of watch crystal polish on a mineral glass crystal.",
      "content": "Use any type of watch crystal polish on a mineral glass crystal. If you have a mid-priced watch, you’re likely telling time through a mineral crystal. This type of watch glass is commonly found in mid-range watches. It’s a glass crystal that has been treated with heat or chemicals to withstand scratches, and might appear hazy. If your watch has a mineral crystal, you can use any polish or paste you would use on an acrylic or sapphire crystal. Mineral crystal is more scratch-resistant than acrylic crystal and tends to crack or shatter under extreme temperatures or when hit from an angle."

      "content": "Polish a sapphire crystal with 0.5 Micron Lapping Paste or 3 Micron DP3 Dia-Paste . If you own an expensive or luxury watch, chances are your watch has a sapphire crystal. This is the most expensive of the three types of watch crystal, and is preferred because of its resistance to scratches and shattering. The crystal also will not appear hazy. You need to use a polish made specifically for sapphire crystals to avoid scratches or damage to the crystal. Sapphire crystals are harder than mineral glass or acrylic crystal and are more likely to withstand cracks and breakage than other types of watch glass."

      "content": "Contact the manufacturer if you’re unsure what type of crystal your watch has. Figuring out the type of crystal your watch contains isn’t always straightforward. If you can’t determine the type of crystal based on price points or age, try sending an email or placing a call to the manufacturer of your watch. They should be able to help you determine what type of crystal was used in the manufacture of your watch. Do not use any type of polish on a watch crystal you are unsure about, as this can cause damage."

      "content": "Protect your watch with painter’s tape . Before you polish a watch , you will want to all cover parts of the watch near the crystal with painter’s tape , paying particular attention to the watch bezel, which is the top ring that surrounds the watch crystal. [1] X Research source Using painter’s tape will protect the rest of your watch from being damaged during the polishing process. While you don’t need to cover the band or strap, you might want to remove it to make the polishing process easier."

      "content": "Apply a pea-sized amount of polish to the surface of the watch crystal. Be conservative with the amount of polish you apply to the watch crystal. Applying too much can make the polishing process more difficult, and increase the odds of gunking up the rest of your watch with the polish. [2] X Research source Green agrees that most “scratches on watch glass can be removed with a bit of special polish and a soft buffing cloth, if they are plastic crystals or armored acrylic.”"

      "content": "Consider replacing the crystal if the scratch is too deep. While polishing watch glass will usually help remove scratches, sometimes a scratch or crack is too deep to repair with a simple polishing routine. If the scratches in your watch glass can’t be removed through polishing, consider replacing your watch crystal. Try taking your watch to a local watch repair shop and ask them to replace the watch crystal. Consider returning the watch to the manufacturer to see if they can replace the watch glass."

      "content": "Avoid intense physical work or hobbies while you wear the watch . If you have a dive watch that can get wet, feel free to wear it while you swim, but if you’re wearing a more delicate vintage piece, try not to wear it on rainy days or while working out. If your job involves a lot of physical work or you love playing rough sports as a pastime, make sure you protect your watch glass from scratches as needed. [4] X Research source If you have a physically demanding job or hobby, try wearing what is called a “beater watch,” which is a watch that you consider expendable. This way, you can save your less durable or more expensive watches for times when you’re not doing physical labor."

When you take your watch off to shower, don’t leave it in the bathroom, especially if it’s non-waterproof. The humidity from the steam can get inside the watch face and damage the movement. If you take your watch off while at the beach or while playing sports, keep it in a bag while you’re not wearing it. [5] X Research source Clean your watch regularly using dish soap and water (only if the watch is waterproof). Keep non-waterproof watches clean by wiping with a soft, dry cloth or soft brush."

Plastic is known to scratch easily, but can usually be buffed out with polish and a cloth. [6] X Research source Hesalite is a specific brand name for a plastic watch face, most commonly used by Omega for the Speedmaster watch. Acrylic and plexiglass are more general terms for plastic watch faces, although plexiglass is also known as a brand name for a type of plastic. [7] X Research source"

Mineral watch crystals are considered mid-range when it comes to cost, and can scratch, chip, or occasionally shatter.

      "content": "Sapphire watch crystals are the most durable of all. They’re made by heating Aluminum Oxide and synthetic sapphire to very high temperatures. The Aluminum Oxide and synthetic sapphire are then pressed together, sliced into disks, and polished with diamond-coated saws. Sapphire watch crystals are a favorite choice of many luxury watch brands and are the most expensive. [9] X Research source Most smart watches, including the Apple Watch, feature sapphire crystals for their watch face. [10] X Research source Some high-end brands feature a sapphire crystal caseback, which is the back case of a watch that is usually made of metal. A sapphire caseback allows you to see the movement in the watch at work."
