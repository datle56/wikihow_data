      "content": "Remove the shells and heads to make eating prawns easier after cooking. You can cook the prawns in their shells as well, removing them later, and this often helps them retain moisture as they cook, But if the prawns are part of a larger dish (like a soup) you don't want to search for scales with your spoon. Luckily, cleaning prawns is easy before cooking. If you are grilling or pan frying your prawns, you should leave at least the shells on. You can leave the heads on the prawns, as they will lead to a stronger flavor, but many people remove them to make eating easier. [1] X Research source"

It may come off in pieces. You can either leave the tail on, usually as a \"handle\" when eating by hand, or remove and discard it if you're cooking the prawns into another dish."

This is not strictly necessary, but the vein has a bitter taste that is best removed now. [3] X Research source You can still remove the vein while leaving the shell on. To do so, clip the shell with scissors and pull the vein out, closing the shell back up. You can also pull the entire vein out in one piece if you break the head off and locate it."
