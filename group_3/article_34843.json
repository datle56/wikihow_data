Soak a cotton ball in saline solution and use it to clean your corkscrew nose ring thoroughly, removing any crust that may be stuck to the jewelry. [2] X Research source If your piercing is completely healed, optionally apply an antibiotic ointment like Neosporin to disinfect the corkscrew (the metal part that goes inside your nose) of your nose ring. Make sure that the upper part of the corkscrew, the part that will show, does not touch the ointment. This part needs to be clean and dry to ensure a tight grip. A corkscrew nose ring is made of a metal wire that is twisted into an odd shape, unlike normal nose studs or rings. The combination of straight and circular wire needs specific care to insert it without getting hurt. Anders advises to “use totally natural products on your body. We clean our piercings with the 0.9% sterile saline solution.” [3] X Expert Source Stephanie Anders Piercing Specialist Expert Interview. 4 December 2019."

Use the same process to twist in the remainder of the straight wire until your jewelry is flush against your nose and none of the wire is visible. [5] X Research source If you start to bleed while inserting the corkscrew, stop and clean your piercing. Contact your piercer or a healthcare professional if there is excessive bleeding or painful irritation. In general, wait a minimum of 2 months before changing your nose ring if the piercing is new, as it needs time to heal completely. Follow the instructions provided by your piercer for more details about when you can change your jewelry."

      "content": "Insert a nose stud straight through your piercing hole. Putting a nose stud (or flat back nose ring ) back in your nose is much easier than reinserting a corkscrew nose ring, as the rod is straight. After washing your hands, your piercing, and your jewelry, slowly insert the rod into your piercing hole while holding the jewelry by its top. If it doesn’t go in smoothly, gently twist it in a clockwise motion. Then, secure the backing onto the rod through your nostril. The backing should be tight enough to keep your jewelry in place without being directly against the inside of your nose. You may also leave the backing off if you don’t need it to keep your jewelry in place. If the piercing has a ball, put the ball through your nose, then gently twist it into the hole while using the finger of your other hand to support it and guide it through. Use a bit of lubricant, if necessary."

Do not let anyone else touch your piercing, especially if they haven’t cleaned their hands thoroughly. [14] X Research source As Anders explains, “when your body is in the first stages of healing a piercing, it’s forming scar tissue and epithelial cells on the inside of the body around that piercing channel. So when you’re twisting and turning it, it’s tearing open all of those cells, which is completely detrimental to your healing process.” [15] X Expert Source Stephanie Anders Piercing Specialist Expert Interview. 4 December 2019."

Pat—don’t rub—the piercing dry with a clean paper towel or tissue. Once the piercing is healed, it’s usually okay to clean it once a day. [16] X Research source If you don’t have saline solution, it’s usually okay to use a gentle, unscented soap and water, but check with your piercer to be sure. Protex soap and Studex are two popular cleaning solutions for piercings. Don’t use mentholated spirits, alcohol swabs, peroxide, or alcohol-based cleaners to clean the piercing. If you don’t have saline solution, create your own by dissolving 1/4 tsp of salt in a cup of warm water. Be sure to remove crust from the jewelry as well as your nose.
