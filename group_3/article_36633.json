Once the bat flies into a room with a window or door that has access the outside, seal off that room to prevent the bat from flying deeper into your house.

Turn off any television, radio, or air conditioner near the exit that might make the bat avoid the area. Try to avoid making a lot of noises, as they will upset the bat and make it behave in less predictable ways."

They’re wild animals and prefer to stay in their natural habitat. The bat is probably looking for a way out, so providing it with an exit may solve your problem. [5] X Research source Choose one exit that you intend to direct the bat to, but open other windows too in case the bat decides to fly out one of them instead. Use sheets with push pins to block off any doorways without doors into other rooms."

Another viable way to catch the bat is to use a decent sized cloth or net to capture the bat once it has landed. Depending on the thickness of the cloth or net, this method may involve more direct contact with the bat. Approach the bat slowly with the cloth or net in front of you. Place the net or cloth over the bat rapidly to avoid giving it an opportunity to fly away. The net may trap the bat immediately. If you are using a cloth towel or blanket, place it over the bat, then gently wrap the bat up with it. Carry the bat outdoors while still in the net or cloth, then release it. It is better for the bat if you release it after nightfall, but you should not keep the bat contained until evening if you capture it during the day."

Bats often roost in attics, so look for gaps in the siding of your home, open windows or cracks. Many attics in older homes have gaps in the wood that are small enough for bats to crawl through, inspect the areas carefully as it takes very little space for a bat to get in. Make sure traditional openings like windows and grain doors in barns are closed securely."

Exclusion devices allow bats to exit your house in the evening just like normal, but prevents them from being able to come back in. There are a number of different types of exclusion devices you can make or that are available for purchase. Netting and screens can serve as exclusion devices if you position them in a way that makes it easy to crawl out of, but low enough that it would be difficult for a bat in flight to find the opening again. Funnels and “bat cones” narrow the entrance so significantly that it makes it difficult for bats to gain access to the funnel again while in flight.
