      "content": "Decorate a sheet of paper with markers, crayons, paint, or stickers. Get out a sheet of construction paper, printer paper, or cardstock. Set it down on a flat surface, then decorate it to your heart's content. If you use paint, be sure to let the paint dry. [1] X Research source Make spots or stripes for a simple design. Draw a pattern, such as hearts, stars, or fish. Decorate the windsock to look like an animal, such as a fish or owl."

      "content": "Roll the paper widthwise into a tube, then glue, tape, or staple it shut. Bring the narrow ends of the paper together to form a tube. Overlap them by 1 inch (2.5 cm). Secure the tube with glue, tape, or staples. [2] X Research source Make sure that the side that you decorated is on the outside of the tube. You can use a glue stick or liquid school glue. If you use liquid school glue, use clothespins or paper clips to hold the paper together until the glue dries."

      "title": "Cut tissue paper or crepe paper into streamers.",
      "content": "Cut tissue paper or crepe paper into streamers. The streamers should each be about 15 inches (38 cm) long. Crepe paper is already cut into narrow strips, so you can leave it as-is, or you can cut it narrower. If you are using tissue paper, however, you should cut it into 1 to 2 in (2.5 to 5.1 cm) strips, and make them about 15 inches (38 cm) long. [3] X Research source Cut enough strips to glue all around the inside edge of your windsock. Plan on using 5 to 10 strips. The streamers don't all have to be the same color. Make each one a different color for a rainbow windsock!"

      "title": "Tape or glue the streams to inside bottom edge of the windsock.",
      "content": "Tape or glue the streams to inside bottom edge of the windsock. Place the end of your first streamer into the windsock by 1 inch (2.5 cm). Tape or glue the streamer down, then move onto the next streamer. Keep going until you covered the entire inside edge with streamers. A glue stick or liquid school glue will work the best for this, but you can use a stapler too if you have nothing else."

      "title": "Punch 2 holes in the top of the windsock, directly across from each other.",
      "content": "Punch 2 holes in the top of the windsock, directly across from each other. Turn the windsock so that the streamers are facing away from you. Use a hole puncher to make 2 holes in the top of the windsock. Make sure that the holes are across from each other. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Thread a piece of string through both holes, then tie the ends together.",
      "content": "Thread a piece of string through both holes, then tie the ends together. Cut a piece of string that is about 3 to 4 times the width of your windsock. Feed the end through both holes. Bring both ends of the string together, then tie them into a knot. Rotate the handle so that the knot is inside the windsock. Yarn works great for this, but you can use any type of string you want, as long as it is thin enough to fit through the holes. Alternatively, you can feed the end of a pipe cleaner through each hole, then bend the ends to hold them in place. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Hang the windsock from a hook. If you really want to see it in action, hang it outside or in front of a fan. Be careful not to leave it outside when it is rainy or snowing. You should also bring it indoors at night, or the dew will damage it. [6] X Research source"

Next, cut a 1 in (2.5 cm) wide ring from 1 of the bottle halves. Keep the ring and recycle the rest. [7] X Research source Young children will need help with this step. If the bottle was dirty inside, wash the ring using soap and warm water. Dry it off with a towel."

Use a marker and a ruler to draw 1 in (2.5 cm) wide stripes across the bag from top-to-bottom. Cut along these lines with a pair of scissors. Make sure that you cut through both layers of plastic. [9] X Research source How many strips you cut depends on how many strips you want your windsock to have. Plan on having about 5 to 7 strips. Use different colors of plastic bags to make a rainbow windsock. [10] X Research source You can also use party streamers, ribbon, or even cellophane!"

Place the folded end into the ring so that it sticks out from the bottom by a few inches/centimeters. Wrap the tail ends of the strip over the top edge, and pull then down through the loop. Tug on the tails to tighten the knot. [11] X Research source Do this for all of the strips until the plastic ring is covered. You may need to cut more strips of plastic, depending on the size of the bottle."
