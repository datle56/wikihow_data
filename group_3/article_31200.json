You can also think of this as the number that both factors are equidistant from. [1] X Research source Note that this method only works if the average of the two factors is a whole number. For example, if you are calculating 23 × 17 {\\displaystyle 23\\times 17} , find the average of 23 and 17: 23 + 17 2 = 40 2 = 20 {\\displaystyle {\\frac {23+17}{2}}={\\frac {40}{2}}=20} So, the average is 20. In other words, 23 and 17 are equidistant from 20."
