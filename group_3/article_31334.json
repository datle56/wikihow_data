      "title": "Satan",
      "content": "Satan Perhaps the most common name for the devil in Western history, “Satan” goes all the way back to the Persian Achaemenid Empire. Jews living in Persia would share stories of “ha-Satan,” a Hebrew name that translates roughly to “the opposer.” [1] X Research source When was this nickname first used? The first uses of the name date back to 550 BCE. Unique implications of this nickname: “Satan” is a uniquely Christian nickname, so it’s rarely associated with other traditions. Fun fact: The word “Satan” appears anywhere from 3 to 38 times in the Bible, depending on which version you’re using. Also, it’s always assumed that the serpent in Genesis 1 is Satan, but it’s never said. There is one reference to a serpent being Satan in the last book of the bible, so we just assume they’re the same figure in Genesis. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Lucifer",
      "content": "Lucifer The same way Islam actually has two names for the Devil, Christianity does as well. The only difference is that Christians don’t seem to really debate the difference between “Lucifer” and “Satan,” so the names are used interchangeably. There probably should be a little more debate, though. “Lucifer” is only mentioned once in the Bible (Isaiah 14:12) and he’s described as a King from Babylon—not a supernatural deity. [3] X Research source When was this nickname first used? The name “Lucifer” first appears in the King James Version of the Bible, which was produced in 1611 CE. However, the name also appears in the Vulgate, a proto-Bible in Latin that was created around 400 CE. Unique implications of this nickname: “Lucifer” is a Romanized name for the planet Venus, so there are some sort of celestial vibes here that are sometimes associated with Lucifer. Fun fact: When treated as different entities, Lucifer is often depicted as being worse than Satan. There was a huge period in the 14th-17th centuries where artists would often paint both of them together."

      "title": "Morningstar",
      "content": "Morningstar You could technically count this as the same name as “Lucifer,” but they are technically two different names. “Morningstar” is “Lucifer” in Latin. Other variations of this nickname include “lightbringer” and “day bringer.” [4] X Research source When was this nickname first used? As a name for the devil, “Morningstar” was probably first used around 400 CE when Latin translations of the Bible first popped up. Unique implications of this nickname: Due to the shiny connotations of being a star bright enough to shine in the morning, “Morningstar” is often associated with more splendid, beautiful, and glamorous depictions of the devil. Fun fact: Jesus is actually called a “bright morning star” in Revelation 22:16. Some Christian scholars use this as evidence that Jesus and Satan are extensions of one another."

    {
      "title": "The Serpent",
      "content": "The Serpent As a nickname for the Devil, “The Serpent” is a reference to the Christian depiction of Satan. Interestingly enough, it’s not necessarily rooted in the snake from the Garden of Eden. Satan is described directly as the “the ancient serpent” in the final book of the Bible (Revelation 12:9; 20:2). [5] X Research source When was this nickname first used? Revelation was written around 95 CE, which is the first documented use. Unique implications of this nickname: “The serpent” sort of gestures towards the Devil’s slimy slipperiness. The forked tongue, the swamp-dwelling, the ambushing, all of it creates a very vivid image of the Devil. Fun fact: Christianity is the only major religion with an explicitly negative view of snakes. In Hinduism, serpents are revered figures who often appear alongside Vishnu and Shiva."

    {
      "title": "Belial",
      "content": "Belial Another Biblical term, “Belial” comes from 2 Corinthians 6:15, which says “What harmony is there between Christ and Belial?” Many Christian apologists and scholars believe this is a reference to the Devil. “Belial” comes from the Hebrew word “beliy,” which means “not,” and “ya’al,” which means “benefit.” [6] X Research source When was this nickname first used? This name is actually relatively prevalent in early Jewish writings. It likely was coined around 100-500 CE. Unique implications of this nickname: This is a pretty esoteric term for the Devil, so you’re really pulling a kind of guttural, ancient energy by using this term. Fun fact: Like “Prince of Darkness,” Belial also pops up in Milton’s Paradise Lost."
    },
    {
      "title": "Beelzebub",
      "content": "Beelzebub Also called “Baalzebub,” Beelzebub (pronounced “bee-el-zuh-bub”) is one of the oldest names on this list. But it wasn’t originally used as a name for the Devil. In the Old Testament, Beelzebub is the name of a false God worshiped by the people in a Philistine city (II Kings 1:1–18). [7] X Research source When was this nickname first used? Around 560-540 BCE. Unique implications of this nickname: Aside from being one of the most fun words to say out loud ever, the name definitely conjures some ancient imagery. Fun fact: The etymology of the word “Beelzebub” is fascinating. It comes from the Hebrew verb “to be lord” and the noun “fly.” Thus, another nickname for the Devil: Lord of the Flies. [8] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Apollyon",
      "content": "Apollyon Also known as “Abaddon,” Apollyon is mentioned in the Bible as a king of demons (Revelation 9:11). A lot of Christians have concluded that this is just another name for the Devil, given Apollyon’s position in Hell’s hierarchy. [9] X Research source When was this nickname first used? When Revelation was written, around 95 CE. Unique implications of this nickname: In the Bible, Apollyon is described as ruling over a horde of locusts who fly out of the smoke generated by a trumpet-furnace. Pretty elaborate visuals, if you ask us. Fun fact: Apollyon and the Greek God Apollo share the same etymology. Both deities have names that mean “destroyer.”"

    {
      "title": "Mammon",
      "content": "Mammon The name “Mammon” comes from the Aramaic word “mamon,” which means “wealth and riches.” The deity appears several times in the New Testament and Jesus even references him during his Sermon on the Mount. Biblically, he is depicted as a demon of some sort. John Milton (again!) popularized this name as a nickname for the Devil in Paradise Lost. [10] X Research source When was this nickname first used? As a nickname for the Devil, Mammon didn’t see use until the 16th century. Unique implications of this nickname: Mammon is intimately associated with evils related to money. It’s the “wealth at all cost” connotation that gives “Mammon” a unique status among the many nicknames for the Devil. Fun fact: Mammon appears in a lot of literature from Milton’s era. Ben Johnson refers to Mammon in The Alchemist, and Mammon is a character in Spenser’s famous The Faerie Queene."

    {
      "title": "Legion",
      "content": "Legion In the Bible, “Legion” is a name given to a group of demons that Jesus pulls out of a man, so it didn’t start out as a nickname for the Devil. Given the fact that multiple demons are embodied in this single name, people often use the word as a synonym for the Devil. [11] X Research source When was this nickname first used? The name first appears around 70 CE, although it isn’t used as a stand-in for the Devil until the 19th century, making it one of the newest nicknames on this list. Unique implications of this nickname: This is probably the closest you can get to a nickname that really implies the Devil is thousands of entities all wrapped up into one being. Fun fact: Readers of the earliest Bibles would have likely interpreted “Legion” to refer specifically to a military unit. A “legion” was originally a military unit in the Roman Empire."

    {
      "title": "Azazel",
      "content": "Azazel Azazel is a false God mentioned in the Old Testament (Leviticus 16). He appears in reference to the sacrifice of a goat. Since he’s depicted as a fake God, many Christians presume he’s just another personification of the Devil trying to trick people against believing in God. [12] X Research source When was this nickname first used? This is the oldest nickname on our list. It was first documented around 1400 BCE! Unique implications of this nickname: Today, Azazel is a popular character in both Marvel and DC comics. It’s also the name of a character in a few popular video games (notably Binding of Isaac). Most people today will probably associate the name with one of those characters. Fun fact: “ Azazel” is actually where the word “scapegoat” comes from. That’s what the Hebrew word translates to!"

    {
      "title": "The Red Dragon",
      "content": "The Red Dragon The Bible explicitly calls Satan “The Red Dragon” in Revelation 12:3-5, making this one of the few outright Biblical nicknames that didn’t need to evolve later as a nickname for the Devil. [13] X Research source When was this nickname first used? Around 96 AD. Unique implications of this nickname: There’s a popular film in the Hannibal series called Red Dragon, so that’s likely where people’s heads will go when they hear this. Fun fact: There’s a famous book from the 1800s called The Red Dragon that supposedly contains instructions for summoning the Devil to forge a deal with them. [14] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "The Antichrist",
      "content": "The Antichrist Technically, the Antichrist is supposed to be the son of Satan, not Satan himself. However, the same way that Jesus is supposed to be an extension of God, the Antichrist is supposed to be an extension of Satan. In Christian traditions, the Antichrist is going to facilitate the end of the world. [15] X Research source When was this nickname first used? These nicknames are first mentioned in the epistles of John, which were published around 90 CE. Unique implications of this nickname: The Antichrist is explicitly involved in the end of the world, so the name is closely tied to the apocalypse. There’s also an association here with someone being born evil. Movies like The Omen and Rosemary’s Baby popularly tell the story of a baby Antichrist, so there’s a kind of “born to bring chaos into the world” energy associated with this nickname. Fun fact: The Antichrist is supposed to be really hot. The Bible says he’s going to be really handsome and tall."

    {
      "title": "Roaring Lion",
      "content": "Roaring Lion Satan is compared to a “roaring lion” in 1 Peter 5:8, so Christians often use this nickname to describe the fear and terror the Devil can spark in people. When was this nickname first used? The nickname is only mentioned in 1 Peter, which was published between 62-64 CE. Unique implications of this nickname: This is a pretty specific nickname. The passage the term originates from involves the author encouraging others to not shy away from Satan and to learn what makes evil so dangerous. That involves listening to the “Roaring Lion.” Fun fact: Winston Churchill was also nicknamed the Roaring Lion. The nickname came from the title of a photographic portrait of Churchill in the middle of World War 2."

      "title": "Ash-Shaytān (Shaitan)",
      "content": "Ash-Shaytān (Shaitan) Also spelled “Shaytan” and “Sheitan,” what do all of these words sound like to you? If you guessed “Satan,” you’re right! Ash-Shaytān is the Muslim word for “Satan.” [16] X Research source When was this nickname first used? It’s actually extremely controversial, but the word likely predates the Quran, which was assembled between 610-632 CE. Unique implications of this nickname: There are sort of two names for the Devil in Islam. “Ash-Shaytān” is not the proper name for the singular “Satan,” but a general term that could apply to any Satan-like being. Fun fact: Depending on how you translate it, “Ash-Shaytān” might just mean “evil spirit.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "Iblis",
      "content": "Iblis Iblis is sort of “the Devil part two” in Islam. It’s the formal name for the specific Devil who appears in the Quran. The story of Iblis is more or less identical to the Biblical Satan—God had angels, Iblis was an angel who refused to follow God’s commands, and he was kicked out of heaven. [17] X Research source When was this nickname first used? It’s unclear, but the word does not seem to have been used prior to the Quran, so the word was presumably coined around 610 CE. [18] X Research source Unique implications of this nickname: Given its specific Islamic origins, the implications here are pretty concrete; people associate this name (and Ash-Shaytān) exclusively with Islam. Fun fact: The fact that Islam kind of has two Devils is why you will often hear Muslims refer to “the Devils” instead of “the Devil.” [19] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Hasatan",
      "content": "Hasatan “Hasatan” is the Hebrew root word for “Satan.” It literally means “the accuser” or “the adversary,” and historians believe it is the pre-Christian character that would eventually become the Biblical Satan. [20] X Research source When was this nickname first used? The origins are extremely unclear, but it seems to have been commonly used in Hebrew texts starting around 950 BCE. Unique implications of this nickname: If you consider the origins, the name has a very “source of all evil” kind of juice to it. Fun fact: “ Hasatan” is actually a very old surname. Etymologically, in Old English, its name is where we get the word “headstone” from!"
    },
    {
      "title": "Old Scratch",
      "content": "Old Scratch Fun nickname, right? This one is an extension of the “Old Nick” nickname for the Devil. A “nick,” in addition to being shorthand for Nicholas, can mean “a small cut or notch.” “Scratch” is another word for a small cut! When was this nickname first used? The earliest documented use of the term is found in “The Story of Jack Spriggins and the Enchanted Bean,” which came out in 1740. As a popular term, it was mainly used in the Southern United States and New England in the 1800s. Unique implications of this nickname: “Old Scratch” has what’s probably the least religious origin on the list, which makes it unique. It’s also got a general kind of folksy, old school energy you don’t find elsewhere. Fun fact: Some people theorize that the nickname is unrelated to “Old Nick.” It’s possible that “Old Scratch” comes from the Middle English word “scrat,” which is the name of a goblin."
    },
    {
      "title": "Old Nick",
      "content": "Old Nick This is a very old nickname used for the Devil, but it’s not entirely clear why the term evolved or where it started. It’s possible that it’s a twist on the Middle English term “niker,” which means “water demon.” [21] X Research source When was this nickname first used? Its first documented use was in the 1600s. Unique implications of this nickname: There’s something hauntingly mundane about this nickname. It also kind of sounds vaguely Christmas-y. Fun fact: When people hear “Old Nick” they may be thinking of Santa Claus. Ironically, this may be the inspiration for the European legend of Krampus, a demonic goat creature who takes “bad” children to hell during Christmastime."
    },
    {
      "title": "Mephistopheles",
      "content": "Mephistopheles Probably the most fun nickname to say alongside “Beelzebub,” “Mephistopheles” is a corrupted compound of two Greek words: “not” and “love.“ Mephistopheles is an entirely modern creation; the name is given to an evil spirit in Von Goethe’s Faust. When was this nickname first used? It was popularized when Goethe’s Faust was published in 1808. It’s possible that Goethe borrowed the name from another Faust story that originally came out in 1587, though. Unique implications of this nickname: Given the concrete origins of this nickname, the associations here are pretty firmly related to Faust, the historical character who makes a bargain with the Devil for his soul. Fun fact: Shakespeare mentions a character named “Mephistopheles” in The Merry Wives of Windsor. They’re a generally mischievous character but not depicted as a devil."
    },
    {
      "title": "Prince of Darkness",
      "content": "Prince of Darkness The Devil may be “Morningstar” but they’re also the Prince of Darkness! This nickname for Satan comes from Paradise Lost, the book-length poem written by John Milton, which focuses on the fall of man. [22] X Research source When was this nickname first used? 1667, when Milton published Paradise Lost. Unique implications of this nickname: Given its origin, the term calls immediately to the poem. “Prince” also implies they’re not actually the king of hell as well, which is pretty interesting. Fun fact: In Manichaeism, one of the largest religions in the world during the 3rd-5th centuries, the “Prince of Darkness” is a major figure composed of five “archaeons” (demon, dragon, eagle, fish, and lion). It’s possible this phraseology bled into early Christianity from this extinct religion."
