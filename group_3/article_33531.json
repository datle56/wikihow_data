      "title": "Try holding a bassoon.",
      "content": "Try holding a bassoon. Before you settle on a bassoon, ensure that your hands are large enough. Cover the C (third) hole with the ring finger of your left hand. See if you can comfortably reach your left thumb to the speaker keys (A, C and D) and the whisper key, without uncovering the note of C. [1] X Research source Bassoons equipped with hole covers for “E” and “C” can help smaller hands. There are models specially made to accommodate small hands, although these may not be as readily available."

      "title": "Consider the associated costs.",
      "content": "Consider the associated costs. You'll need ready access to a bassoon and bassoon reeds, both of which are costly. Even the lower cost bassoons are thousands of dollars, so many students start on school-owned instruments. A bassoon uses a double reed – two pieces of bamboo tied together that vibrate when blown into. [2] X Research source The reeds cost about $10-15 each, and you should keep a supply of at least three to four quality reeds on hand. Reeds can break easily. If you care for them well and handle them gently, a good reed can last about a month. If you take a reed out carelessly, it can chip before you ever get the chance to use it. You want to make sure that you keep your reeds inside a special bassoon reed case so that they can be protected from being bumped but still dry out. Also when you use a reed it's good to alternate between 2-3 reeds so that they have time to dry out before their next use. Bassoons come in wood or plastic material. You may be able to achieve a warmer tone with a wood bassoon. Plastic versions tend to be less expensive."

      "content": "Be willing to resist peer pressure , if applicable. Depending on your age group, your peers might view the bassoon as odd or comical. [3] X Research source It has a large, interesting shape and can emit humorous sounds. This can especially be an issue in secondary school. However, the bassoon is not a commonly recognized instrument and therefore people of various age groups may crack jokes about it. [4] X Research source If you plan to love your instrument regardless of other people's comments and opinions, the bassoon may be right for you."

    {
      "title": "Be willing to practice.",
      "content": "Be willing to practice. The bassoon is one of the hardest instruments to play – even music teachers struggle with it. [5] X Research source Learning to play a complex instrument requires a lot of effort. For instance, expert bassoonists practice one to three hours a day or more. [6] X Research source You may want to split up your practice time. For example, two hours in the morning and two hours in the evening."

      "title": "Don't despair if the bassoon's just not for you.",
      "content": "Don't despair if the bassoon's just not for you. The right instrument for you should be enjoyable and practical for you as an individual. There are many other instruments you can choose from! You may even experiment with various instruments until you find the one that resonates with you the most."

    {
      "title": "Decide how you will acquire reeds.",
      "content": "Decide how you will acquire reeds. Having good reeds is one of the most important considerations when playing the bassoon. You can save money by making your own reeds, but it is a time-consuming process. Your reeds should not have cracks in them. All of the wires should be intact. You should look for professional, handmade reeds rather than machine-produced reeds. Try premade reeds when you're just starting out. You don't want to invest the time it takes to learn about making your own reeds (and invest in the necessary equipment) if you end up deciding not to be a bassoonist. If you've decided to stick with the bassoon, consider making your own reeds. You can purchase reed making kits. Alternately, you can gather the materials for finishing your own reeds by acquiring a reed knife, mandrel, reamer, plaque, small rat-tail file, fine flat file, fine sandpaper, small pliers, small block of hardwood, and cane. Some of these items can be found in hardware stores, and others you can look for at local music stores or online."
    },
    {
      "title": "Acquire a reed case.",
      "content": "Acquire a reed case. Your reed case should be ventilated with holes to prevent mildew. If your reeds came in an airtight plastic container, don't use that for storing your reeds. Avoid cases with plastic foam or cotton cushioning, which can promote mildew. Look for a reed case that can store at least three reeds and has mandrels for mounting them. Wood or tin cases that hold reeds securely work well."

      "title": "Consider getting a reed soaker.",
      "content": "Consider getting a reed soaker. A reed soaker is a sealable container that you fill with water and use to soak your reed before using it to play your instrument. You can purchase a container for soaking reeds, or repurpose a container you already have that will suit the purpose. If you don't want to get a reed soaker, you can use a faucet to wet your reeds instead. For example, a small lidded plastic container, an empty pill container with a lid, or an empty film canister will all do the job. If you're playing in a school band, you might be required to have a reed soaker on hand. Check with your instructor."

    {
      "title": "Select a swab and brush.",
      "content": "Select a swab and brush. You should use a swabbing cloth to clean your bassoon every time you finish playing it. You will need a pull through swab, so that it can remove the moisture from inside your bassoon. Get a small brush for dusting under the keys. Pick a brush with natural bristles, not synthetic. Avoid wool swabs which shed fibers and can get stuck in parts of your instrument. [7] X Research source Silk swabs are a good choice. Don't use long “pipe cleaner” swabs. For instance, a paint brush that is one inch wide will work as a dusting brush."
    },
    {
      "title": "Get straps.",
      "content": "Get straps. You will need a seat strap to play the bassoon sitting down. If you want to play it standing up, you'll need a neck strap also. If your bassoon didn't come with a seat strap, you can either buy one or make one using an old belt. [8] X Research source Cut the buckle off the belt. Use pliers to insert a metal coat hanger through one of the belt holes. Bend the wire until it is the shape of a hook."

      "title": "Consider getting a hand rest.",
      "content": "Consider getting a hand rest. Having a hand rest is optional, however you may need one depending on the length of your hand. If you're going to use a neck strap, you will need some type of hand support. Select a hand rest with a size and shape that is comfortable for you."

      "content": "Make sure the bassoon is in working condition. If the instrument has issues, have it checked by a repair person. The instrument may or may not be repairable, depending upon how long it's been since the instrument was used, and how severe the damage is. Check for cracks in the body or pieces missing. Ensure that all of the pads seal, particularly the pads close to the bell. Check the bocal for dents and fissures."

      "content": "Practice embouchure. Embouchure refers to the placement of your mouth, lips and tongue when playing an instrument. Place the reed in your mouth. Cover your teeth with your lips, keeping your lips relaxed. Don't bite down on the reed or flatten out your lips. Imagine that there is a drawstring in your lips, and someone is pulling the string towards the back of your mouth, forming a cushion over the reed with your lips. Your upper lip should almost touch the first wire. Keep your chin muscles stretched downward and your cheeks smooth. [15] X Research source Practice in front of a mirror to make sure your embouchure is correct."

    {
      "title": "Learn fingering.",
      "content": "Learn fingering. Consult a fingering chart and keep it nearby for reference while you are still learning. The whisper key is your left thumb's home base. Don't rest your right thumb on the bassoon. If you want to play sheet music, you'll need to learn music notations . You can learn how to read music and play the bassoon simultaneously by taking lessons."
    },
    {
      "title": "Try different air techniques.",
      "content": "Try different air techniques. Practice fast and slow air flow. This will help you to observe how air stream affects pitch. Blow into the bocal slowly. Then increase your air flow without changing your embouchure. Practice vibrato. Vibrato is when you add pulsing to notes. Try not to use pressure from your jaw to make a vibrato effect. Use your abdomen primarily and your larynx secondarily to create vibrato pulsations. [17] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Clean components regularly.",
      "content": "Clean components regularly. Use a damp cloth to clean the keys after every use. Dust under the keys with a small brush. Wash saliva off the reed with water or by using light sandpaper on it. Every week, wipe down your bassoon with a damp cloth, without wetting the pads. Dry your instrument with a swab cloth. If your bassoon has a wood finish, polish it every two months with furniture polish. Polish silver keys monthly. You should have a professional repair person buff nickel keys annually. If your instruments' keys frequently tarnish despite regular cleaning, discuss it with the manufacturer of your bassoon. The climate you play in and the way you play your instrument may be contributing factors. For bassoons with a plastic finish, you can also use soap and water."

    {
      "title": "Grease the tenons well.",
      "content": "Grease the tenons well. If there are strings on your tenons, you can grease those as well. Cork wound tenons require a bit more maintenance than thread wrapped tenons. Never use cork grease on thread wound tenons. For cork wound tenons, wipe off any old coating of grease. Then apply a thin layer of cork grease every two weeks. For thread wrapped tenons, warm a cake of canning wax in your hands until it softens. Then add a thin coat of wax onto the threads. Never use cork grease on thread wound tenons."

      "title": "Make adjustments to your reeds.",
      "content": "Make adjustments to your reeds. Occasionally you will need to adjust your reed when it isn't sounding right. If the sound is flat, buzzy, or the reed responds too easily, the reed is too soft. If the sound is sharp, muffled, or the reed doesn't respond well, the reed is too hard. Fix a soft reed by opening the first and second wires carefully with needle-nose pliers. Gently slide the reed through 600 grit sandpaper. Then use 240 grit sandpaper lightly on both sides of the front half. Fix a hard reed by slightly closing the first and second wires with needle nose pliers. Gently sand both sides of the reed with 600 grit sandpaper. Then use 240 grit sandpaper to lightly sand the back third of of the reed on both sides, while focusing on the reed's center."
