      "title": "Purchase a non-abrasive brand of white-colored toothpaste.",
      "content": "Purchase a non-abrasive brand of white-colored toothpaste. The toothpaste can’t contain any mint, gel, and/or teeth-whitening properties. Regular white toothpaste is most effective at cleaning glass lenses, whereas toothpaste containing special properties can cause further damage to lenses. Baking soda-infused toothpaste such as Arm & Hammer's toothpaste is a great candidate for cleaning toothpaste because it cleans without using abrasive chemicals."

      "title": "Apply a pea-sized amount of toothpaste to a cotton ball.",
      "content": "Apply a pea-sized amount of toothpaste to a cotton ball. Stick with a smaller amount so your glasses don’t become smudged with an excessive amount of paste. Cotton balls are the most effective as they leave little residue or stray fibers behind."
    },
    {
      "title": "Rub the cotton ball into the scratch.",
      "content": "Rub the cotton ball into the scratch. Move the cotton ball around in circular motions for about 10 seconds for each scratch. This movement will help buff the scratch from the lens."
    },
    {
      "title": "Rinse the toothpaste from the lens.",
      "content": "Rinse the toothpaste from the lens. Put your glasses under a steady stream of cool water in order to remove the toothpaste. Rotate the lens under the water to ensure all of the toothpaste is washed away. Pay special attention to any paste adhered to small crevices where your lenses meet the frame."
    },
    {
      "title": "Rub the toothpaste off with a soft, lint-free cloth.",
      "content": "Rub the toothpaste off with a soft, lint-free cloth. Don’t use any coarse or dirty cloths as this can easily add another scratch to your sunglasses. Using your thumb and forefinger, carefully rub the cloth around the scratch to remove any remaining moisture or paste. Take special care not to apply too much pressure to your lenses so you don't accidentally pop them out."
    },
    {
      "title": "Inspect the lens.",
      "content": "Inspect the lens. Put the lens under the light to verify the scratch has been removed. Place your sunglasses back on and look to see if any scratches are visible. If the scratch is still on the lens, clean the lenses with the toothpaste and cotton ball as many times as needed until the scratch is no longer visible. [1] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Gather water and baking soda.",
      "content": "Gather water and baking soda. The alkaline properties of baking soda make it ideal for breaking down any acidic residue and restoring the clarity of lenses. When combined, water and baking soda form a thick paste that can be used to remove a scratch while cleaning the glasses. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Combine one part water with two parts baking soda in a small bowl.",
      "content": "Combine one part water with two parts baking soda in a small bowl. The amount of water and baking soda you should use depends largely on the size and number of scratches on your sunglasses. Start with a tablespoon of water and two tablespoons of baking soda and add more for heavily scratched sunglasses."

    {
      "title": "Mix the water and baking soda.",
      "content": "Mix the water and baking soda. Stir them together until the mixture turns into a thick paste. Make sure the mixture isn’t too watery as it will be less effective in removing the scratches."
    },
    {
      "title": "Grab a cotton ball.",
      "content": "Grab a cotton ball. Dip a portion of the cotton ball into the water and baking soda paste. You only need a pea-sized amount of the mixture for each scratch."

      "content": "Rinse away the baking soda mixture from the lens. Use cool or room temperature water to wash away the paste. Take extra care to remove the paste from the crevice between the lens and the frame, or any other tiny areas where the paste could seep in."

      "title": "Clean the lenses with a soft, lint-free cloth.",
      "content": "Clean the lenses with a soft, lint-free cloth. These types of cloths are crucial to ensure your glasses aren’t further scratched in the cleaning process. Consider picking up a pack of Microfiber eyeglass cloth at your local drugstore or supermarket. Use this to wipe away any remaining traces of paste from the lens."

      "title": "Obtain car wax, furniture wax, or brass or silver polish.",
      "content": "Obtain car wax, furniture wax, or brass or silver polish. These types of polishes and waxes work the same way on lenses as they do on other surfaces. They are often highly effective at removing scratches from sunglasses, especially lenses made from plastic. Never use any abrasive or acidic cleaners as these will damage your glasses and leave residue that's harmful to your eyes. [3] X Research source"
