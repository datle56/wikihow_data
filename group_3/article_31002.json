MMA, short for “Mixed Martial Arts,” combines boxing, judo, jiu-jitsu, wrestling, and other full-contact fighting sports. [1] X Research source The United Fighting Championship, better known as the UFC, is a company that promotes MMA. The UFC hosts matches where professional MMA fighters compete with each other, just like boxers and wrestlers do for their sports. [2] X Research source In other words, MMA is to the UFC what basketball is to the NBA. The former is a sport, and the latter is an organization that promotes that sport. There are many MMA companies in the world, but the UFC is the largest and most famous. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Mixed Martial Arts (MMA) is a popular full-contact fighting sport. As the name suggests, the sport incorporates a “mix” of various martial arts disciplines. Fighters are sorted by weight class and compete in an octagon—a space similar to a boxing ring—where they punch, kick, and wrestle their opponents into submission or unconsciousness. [4] X Research source The term “Mixed Martial Arts” originated from a 1993 article written about UFC 1, the first official MMA event held by the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC). [5] X Research source Though the term “MMA” is recent, the sport itself dates back to Ancient Greece, where athletes would compete in matches using various hand-to-hand combat techniques. Back then, the only “illegal” moves were biting and eye-gouging. Anything else was allowed. [6] X Research source Today, there are dozens of rules governing what MMA fighters can and cannot do in the ring. For instance, strikes to the spine, throat, and back of the head aren’t allowed. These rules have been put in place to prevent serious injuries—or worse."

      "content": "MMA fighters train in multiple fighting disciplines. To perfect their striking and kicks, MMA fighters train in boxing, karate, Muay Thai, and taekwondo, among other styles. For grappling and ground fighting, they learn judo, Brazilian jiu-jitsu, and multiple varieties of wrestling. They also practice strength and cardiovascular training to maximize their overall fitness . [7] X Research source This combination of fighting styles makes MMA an exciting and unpredictable sport. Each individual fighter brings unique skills and specialties to the ring."

      "content": "An MMA match is won with a tap-out, knockout, or decision. Knockouts occur when a fighter knocks their opponent unconscious (or close to it). Tap-outs happen when a fighter puts an opponent in a headlock or chokehold. And finally, a decision is used when a fight doesn’t end after multiple rounds, so a panel of judges decides the winner based on which fighter landed more kicks and punches, or which one spent the most time “dominating” their opponent. [8] X Research source “Technical knockouts” can also happen, where a referee will end a match when a fighter is still standing but unable to defend themself due to injuries. A technical knockout still counts as a win. Matches can end in other ways, including “stoppages” due to medical problems or critical injuries. But these endings don’t always result in a winner."

Fighters from around the world train and compete for an opportunity to fight in the UFC. The majority of fighters don’t earn a lot of money, but the most successful ones are paid millions for a single match. [10] X Research source There are currently 3,022 fighters on the UFC’s roster: 292 women and 2,730 men. [11] X Research source Male and female fighters compete for UFC championship titles according to their gender and weight class. Though UFC dominates the sport, there are many smaller MMA organizations around the world. Other companies include Invicta (from the USA), Pancrase (from Japan), and Caged Steel (based in the UK).
