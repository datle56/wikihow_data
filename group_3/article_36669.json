      "title": "Lift the door latch and remove the screw attaching it to the panel.",
      "content": "Lift the door latch and remove the screw attaching it to the panel. Hold the door handle latch open and look for a fastening screw at the base of the latch. Take a screwdriver and remove the screw. Set the screw aside so you don’t lose it. [1] X Research source You may need to hold the latch open in order to access the fastening screw. Door panel mounting screws are often covered by small panels in various locations of the door panel, and you can look for screw covers in the door handles and along the panel edges."

      "title": "Use a pair of pliers to pull the door latch off of the panel.",
      "content": "Use a pair of pliers to pull the door latch off of the panel. The door latch is also held in place by small plastic clips that can make it difficult to remove by hand. Use a pair of pliers to get a good grip on the latch and then gently, but firmly pull the latch away from the panel. [2] X Research source Don’t yank or twist the latch or you could damage the connecting clips. Be careful not to squeeze the latch too hard with the pliers or you could crack or crush it. Be patient and use as little force as possible when prying on a clip. This will reduce damage to the clip, your pry tool, and the vehicle, reducing rework and headaches. The attachment methods used are diverse and it can be difficult to find and remove some of those attachments. A quality video showing you exactly how the panel is attached will speed up the process and greatly reduce the risk and frustration."

      "content": "Wedge a screwdriver into the lower edge of the control panel and pry it up. Most modern cars have a panel on the door that controls the windows and door lock. Take a flathead screwdriver and wedge it into the lower edge of the control panel, where it connects to the door panel. Use gentle pressure to pry it up and pop it out of place. The control panel is held in place by small connecting clips that can be easily damaged if you snap or jerk the screwdriver to remove it."

      "title": "Disconnect the wires from the control panel to remove it.",
      "content": "Disconnect the wires from the control panel to remove it. Locate the plugs on the backside of the panel. Take a firm grip on the plug and gently wiggle it as you pull it off. Remove any plugs attached to the panel. Some plugs may have clips that you need to press while you pull them to remove them. Don’t try to force or yank on the plugs or you could damage them."

      "title": "Remove the clip wire and pull off the window crank if there is one.",
      "content": "Remove the clip wire and pull off the window crank if there is one. Some cars may have a manual window crank that needs to be removed. Take a metal pick tool and wedge it behind the crank. Locate the small clip wire holding it in place and slide it out from behind the crank. Then, pull the crank straight out with your hands to remove it. [3] X Research source There may also be a plastic washer behind the crank, so make sure you don’t lose it when you pull it off if you plan to reassemble the door panel later."

Take a flathead screwdriver and wedge it into the crack at the edge of the panel. Apply gentle pressure to pop it out and remove it.

Then, remove any screws holding the speaker in place. Pull the speaker out of the door panel and unplug any wires connected to it. [6] X Research source The wire harness may require you to pinch or hold the clip holding it in place. Speakers can be damaged easily so don’t drop it or yank it from the door panel."

      "content": "Pry off any screw covers from the door panel with a screwdriver. Look for small, round plastic pieces that are the same color as your door panel, wedge a flathead screwdriver into them, and pry them off to expose the fastening screws beneath them. Check behind the door latch, beneath the control panel, and on the sides of the door panel. [7] X Research source Fastening screws can be installed in a variety of locations depending on your car door, so be sure to look all around for the covers that conceal them."

      "content": "Grab the door panel at the top and bottom and wiggle it. Use your hands to take a firm grip on the door panel with your hands by holding it at the top and bottom. Make sure that all of the fastening screws have been removed by giving the panel a good shake to see if it’s loose enough to pull off. [9] X Research source If there are any spots that won’t wiggle, there may be a fastening screw that you missed. Gently wiggling the panel will loosen the connecting clips, making it easier to remove."

Disconnect the small, plastic connector clips holding the door panel in place by pulling the door panel straight out using 1 swift motion. The clips will unsnap and the panel will come right off. [10] X Research source Don’t pull at an upward or downward angle or the clips won’t release the panel. Avoid using multiple, jerky motions. If the panel is difficult to remove, check that you’ve removed all of the fastening screws and trim pieces that may be holding it in place."
