      "content": "Check to make sure the aneroid manometer is calibrated correctly. When you look at the dial, make sure it is at the zero baseline before starting. If it isn't, you need to calibrate it using a mercury manometer. Connect it with a Y connector, and once you move the dial over, check the pressure at several readings on both meters to make sure the aneroid manometer matches the mercury manometer.

      "content": "Pick a cuff that is an appropriate size. Larger patients will need larger cuffs; otherwise, their blood pressure will read higher than it actually is. Similarly, smaller patients will need smaller cuffs; otherwise, their blood pressure will read lower than it actually is. [3] X Research source To pick the right size cuff, measure the bladder of the cuff against your patient's arm. The bladder is the part of the cuff where the air enters it. The bladder should go at least 80 percent of the way around the patient's arm."

      "title": "Tell the patient what you are doing.",
      "content": "Tell the patient what you are doing. You should perform this step even if you think the patient can't hear you due to unconsciousness. Tell the patient that you are going to use a cuff to take his blood pressure, and that he will feel some pressure from the cuff. [4] X Research source Remind the patient that he should not talk while you are taking his blood pressure. Try to calm down an anxious patient by asking about his day or something he enjoys. You can also ask him to take a few deep breaths to relax him. If you take the reading while he is still anxious, it can give a falsely high reading.Nonetheless, some patients will always be nervous in a doctor's office. If the patient is very anxious, try giving him five minutes to relax and calm down."

      "title": "Ask the patient questions.",
      "content": "Ask the patient questions. Ask if the patient has had an alcoholic beverage or smoked a cigarette in the 15 minutes prior to the test. Those two actions can affect the reading. Also ask the patient if she is on any medications that may affect blood pressure readings. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Get the patient into position.",
      "content": "Get the patient into position. The patient can be standing, sitting, or lying down. If the patient is sitting, the arm should be bent at the elbow and his feet should be flat on the floor. Ensure that the arm is resting at the same level at the heart. If the patient supports his own arm, it can lead to a false reading. [6] X Trustworthy Source Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Main public health institute for the US, run by the Dept. of Health and Human Services Go to source The patient's arm should be bare of restrictive clothing with the sleeves of any clothing comfortably rolled up. However, ensure that the rolled-up clothing isn't cutting off the blood supply. The arm should be slightly flexed at the elbow, and supported throughout the reading on a flat, stable surface. Make sure the patient is comfortable in this position. If he's not, it can give a falsely high reading."

[22] X Trustworthy Source American Heart Association Leading nonprofit that funds medical research and public education Go to source Doctors do not have an exact range for low blood pressure. Generally, low blood pressure is only a problem if you're having symptoms. Symptoms include dizziness, an inability to concentrate, thirstiness, tiredness, nausea, fast breathing, and blurry vision.
