Things like community theatre, improv groups, and writing clubs are all perfect when it comes to meeting new people and finding friends.

      "content": "Instead of giving head nods and waves, try talking to them! You know what’s better than a new friend? A new friend who lives a few buildings over from you! Don’t go on autopilot when you see the people on your block—actually engage them in conversation. If you find someone you could see yourself hanging out with, the two of you may become friends over time. [8] X Research source An easy way to chat a neighbor up is to ask about something that happened in the area. You might say, “Hey, do you know why they shut Main Street down last week?” or, “What was all that noise last weekend? It sounded like it was coming from the end of the block.” Alternatively, you could ask for a recommendation. “Do you know if there’s a good Mediterranean place around here?” can spark a friendly conversation."

Your old friends may have other friend groups, and asking your friend to introduce you can be a great way to grow your circle.

      "content": "Sharing something personal can put new people at ease. People tend to be a bit guarded when they interact with people they don’t know very well. This can make it hard to connect. To break the barrier, try opening up and being more vulnerable than you might normally be. Just pretend you’re already kind of friends. This will help them connect and bond with you. [11] X Research source For example, if you’re talking to a new person and they ask you how you are, you might normally say, “I’m good, you?” Instead, try saying something like, “I’m great actually! I had a wonderful day. I went shopping actually.”"

You might say their outfit is really on point, or tell them you like some accessory they have. As you get to know people better, make the compliments more meaningful. This will make it much easier to build relationships with new people. [13] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Business Review Online and print journal covering topics related to business management practices Go to source More meaningful compliments might include things like, “You’re really kind,” or, “I love the way you think about things.” You don’t need to go over the top or anything—these little comments matter."
