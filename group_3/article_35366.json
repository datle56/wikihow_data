[3] X Research source Even if the profile is private, you can check their post number by looking at the top of their profile. You should also look out for accounts that used to post a lot but don’t anymore. If they’ve been inactive for a while, they could be fake."

If you notice a huge discrepancy between their following number and their followers, there’s a chance that their account is fake.

If it’s not more than a few days old, there’s a good chance the account is fake.

[8] X Research source This could also indicate a real person using fake followers to up their numbers. You can also check out their followers to see if they look real or not. If a lot of their followers are inactive, don’t have profile photos, or have super generic names, it’s a good indication that the followers are fake (so the account might be too)."
