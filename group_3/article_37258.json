Unplug the machine from the wall outlet and wait 60 seconds before plugging the machine back in. [1] X Research source If the machine is hardwired into the wall or you’d have to pull out the entire machine to access the outlet, just flip the fuse connected to the washing machine off and wait 1 minute. If you don’t know where the fuse is, you can flip the main power breaker instead. If you see the word “Cabrio” on your machine’s panel, see our section on Cabrios ."

      "content": "If “Loc” is displayed, press and hold the “control lock” button. Most Whirlpool machines have a control lock designed to shut everything off and lock the door so kids can’t climb into the drum. It’s possible you hit this button by accident, so find the “control lock” button and press it. If nothing happens, press it and hold the button for at least 5 seconds. Your machine should come back to life. [2] X Research source On some machines, you’ll see a little padlock logo pop on when the control lock is active. If you don’t see any buttons labeled “control lock,” try pressing “start” or “start/pause.” Then, try holding them down for at least 5 seconds. If that doesn’t work, find your manual and search for the control lock info."

      "content": "Turn the washer off but leave the power on. There appears to be a period in Whirlpool's history where they used a dial-based reset method, but those instructions appear to be relatively hard to find on their website. If you have a newer model but unplugging it and unlocking the control lock doesn’t work, try turning the cycle off. [3] X Research source Leave the power on the washer on, though. Then, perform the following steps: Turn the dial mode to “normal” Turn the dial counter-clockwise for 1 click. Turn the dial clockwise for 3 clicks. Turn the dial counterclockwise for 1 click. Turn the dial clockwise for 1 click. Press the start button. If only 3 lights come on, you’re good to go. If all the cycle lights come on, press “start/stop” once. Rotate the dial until you see “rinse,” “wash,” and “stop” illuminated. Then, unplug the machine, wait 10 seconds, and plug it back in."

These were their most popular line at the time, and many are still out there today. If your Cabrio isn’t responsive or something seems off, start by pressing “pause/cancel” or “pause.” Then, select a wash cycle on the dial and hit the start button. [6] X Research source Whirlpool stopped making them around ten years ago, so if your washer feels like it’s on the newer side and you don’t see “Cabrio” on the top panel, it’s probably not a Cabrio."

If the washer is hardwired into the wall or you can't reach the outlet, flip the circuit on the fuse box. Then, wait at least 10 minutes. [7] X Research source This interrupts the machine’s natural cycle. It will force reset over the next 5-10 minutes as the electrical charge drains."

Then, run whatever wash cycle the dial is sitting on with nothing in the drum. The washing machine will be all good to go after that load is finished. [8] X Research source If you can’t get the cycle to run or the machine is still not running properly, it may be time to replace your washer. On average, washing machines only last around ten years, and that’s about how old most Cabrios are at this point. [9] X Research source"

      "content": "Inadequate power Check your outlet to ensure your machine is plugged in. If it is, test the outlet itself by plugging a phone charger in to confirm it works. If the phone charger works but the machine isn’t turning on, it’s likely that the outlet isn’t providing enough voltage for the washing machine. Alternatively, there could be something wrong with your machine’s electrical wiring. [10] X Research source The Solution: If the outlet does appear to be working, try flipping the fuse on and off. If that doesn’t fix the problem, contact an electrician to have the problem diagnosed by a pro."

      "content": "Overheated machine If you’ve been running the machine repeatedly for multiple hours now, it’s possible that your washer’s components are just running too hot. Put your hand on the side of the machine. If it’s really warm, you’re probably close to blowing the washer’s engine out. The Solution: Wait a few hours. Give your machine a rest and wait for the heat to dissipate. In the future, try to avoid running more than 2-3 cycles in a row. If your engine still overheats, contact a repair company."

      "content": "Wrong cycle configuration If the control lock is activated or you accidentally hit the “delay start” button, your washer won’t activate even when you press the “start” button. [11] X Research source The Solution: Reset your cycle. If you don’t know how (or why the machine locked in the first place), just unplug it and wait 10 minutes before plugging it back in."

Most Whirlpool machines will not start if the door isn’t locked and secured. [12] X Research source The Solution: Contact an appliance repair company or reach out to Whirlpool if your warranty is still good. The lid likely needs to be replaced."
