If someone cuts in front of you while you're in line, this is rude. You can just ignore it, or you can be assertive. It depends on how bothered you are by it.

Understanding why people engage in rude behaviors will help you gain a broader perspective and respond with more awareness and less compulsion. A person may perform \"downward comparisons\" to feel better about themselves. This is a social positioning tactic where if they feel like she can bully you with rudeness and insults, it will make them feel more powerful in comparison. Obviously this comes from a sense of insecurity rather than confidence. Research suggests that sometimes a person will project things they don't want to admit about themselves on to other people. For instance, if she thinks she is physically unattractive deep down, she might go around telling other people they are ugly. This temporarily passes the problem on to others. A person may also respond with rudeness when they feel threatened. You don't always need to actually threaten them; they may feel threatened simply by being in your presence, if you are confident or have other desirable qualities."

If the person is a co-worker, did you forget to do something that was then passed on to them? If the person is a family member, did you take someone else's side in an argument? The person could even be trying to help in a roundabout way, or want to connect but not know how. [12] X Research source Maybe they upset you by accident, and didn't know they were being rude."

This kind of understanding, compassionate response is worth it, because compassion has a large number of benefits, such as increased peace of mind, creativity, and healthy communication. Sometimes rude behaviors happen because someone is just having a rough day. You might find that after addressing the person's needs and have diffused the other person's frustration, he or she might apologize to you for their bad behavior."
