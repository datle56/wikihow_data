      "title": "Hold the ball out in front of you, with the laces pointing up.",
      "content": "Hold the ball out in front of you, with the laces pointing up. Grip it with your dominant hand as if you were going to give it a handshake, firmly holding it between your thumb and fingers. Extend your dominant arm as far in front of you as you can, continuing to hold the ball horizontally, with the laces still pointing up, pushing the ball out. [1] X Research source Angle the nose of the ball to point slightly in the opposite direction of your dominant hand (if you're right-handed, point it slightly to the left)."

    {
      "title": "Take two steps forward.",
      "content": "Take two steps forward. Stand in a controlled open stance, with your feet about a foot (.3 meters) apart, with one foot about 4 inches in front of the other (10 cm). It doesn't matter which foot is in front. Once you've positioned your feet, you'll need to take two steps forward -- the first with your kicking foot, the second with your other foot -- so that you've gained some momentum while keeping your kicking foot behind your other foot. [2] X Research source Your forward steps should be smooth and controlled. Don't walk or run toward the ball; instead, approach it at a fast pace. Take two normal-sized steps. Taking stutter steps or long strides will make it more difficult for you to punt the ball."

    {
      "title": "Kick the ball right after you drop it.",
      "content": "Kick the ball right after you drop it. The ball has to be dropped parallel to the ground so you kick it in the right direction. Kick your foot forward and drop the ball at the same time so that you kick the ball as late as you can, so you're almost kicking it out of your fingers without actually making contact with your hand. Kick your foot straight up so that it hits the ball dead on, instead of kicking it across your body, as many people have a tendency to do. [3] X Research source Your toes should be pointed forward and you should kick the ball with the top of your kicking foot. Move your dominant hand away to the side, and lift your other hand in the air to help you follow through and gain momentum. You should make contact at the height of your knee."
    },
    {
      "title": "Follow through.",
      "content": "Follow through. Finish the kicking motion, kicking your leg almost as high as it will go to maximize the ball's height and speed. When you're done kicking, plant your foot back on the ground. Then, watch in awe as your ball travels over the field. [4] X Research source"
