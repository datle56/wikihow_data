      "content": "Talk to your dermatologist about prescription skin medications. Oftentimes, you can get rid of a vascular birthmark (such as hemangiomas) by taking corticosteroids. Corticosteroids slow down the development of birthmarks and reduce their size but they do not actually remove the mark. Corticosteroids can be taken orally, injected into the birthmark, or used topically. Other medications used for birthmarks include propranolol and vincristine, which are used for hemangiomas (see the last section below for more details).

      "content": "Investigate laser therapy. Laser therapy can help to reduce the size and halt the development of vascular birthmarks. Laser therapy involves the application of focused, short laser light bursts to the birthmark and can be used to lessen the color, reduce the size, and even stop certain birthmarks from growing. [2] X Research source Laser therapy can be used to remove port-wine stains and café au lait spots but is not always successful, causing the spots to return. [3] X Research source Although total removal of birthmarks may be impossible, they can be lightened considerably after several sessions of laser therapy. Laser therapy can be an effective treatment method, but it can also be very expensive."

      "content": "Consider cryosurgery to remove birthmarks. Cryosurgery uses liquid nitrogen to freeze and fade spots, causing them to peel off. [4] X Research source During the procedure, liquid nitrogen is applied on the mark to freeze the skin on and under the spot. Then, the skin is scraped off using an instrument known as curette. Complications of cryosurgery include scarring and lightened skin color."

      "content": "Look into surgical excision. Skin surgery can be done as an outpatient procedure and only involves a removal of very limited amounts of outer skin. Although surgical removal of skin is considered a minor procedure, it is still invasive and a preoperative assessment of the patient should be done by the doctor. [5] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Surgery can be done to remove moles and hemangiomas Depending on the size of the birthmark, surgery may leave a permanent scar. During the procedure, your doctor will provide a local anesthesia to numb the area and then removes the birthmark with a scalpel. The skin is then stitched together using dissolving suture. Surgical excision is often intended for deeper birthmarks."

      "content": "Use lemon juice to lighten skin. Lemon juice contains ingredients that can naturally lighten the skin. However, the efficacy of lemon juice in treating birthmarks has not been scientifically confirmed and thus, you should use this method with reservations. Apply fresh lemon juice on the birthmark for 20 minutes and rinse off. Repeat several times a week. Do not use if the lemon juice causes skin irritation. Keep in mind that you will probably have to repeat this treatment (or any home remedy) many times over many months to see an improvement. You may be better off speaking with a dermatologist about medical treatment options if you want to remove a birthmark."

However, remember that iodine solution is a medical product and should be used with caution. Also, avoid using this treatment if you have an allergy to iodine or shell fish.

A mole (also called congenital nevi) is a pigmented birthmark (caused by an overgrowth of the melanin-producing cells) on the skin that generally appears during childhood.

Smooth, flat, wrinkled or raised texture. Oval to round shape. Typically less than 1/4 inch in diameter but sometimes moles can be bigger. Sometimes moles have hair growing on them.

      "content": "Identify if your birthmark is a café au lait. These pigmented birthmarks are sometimes caused by a genetic disorder called neurofibromatosis. This condition is divided into three distinct types; the mildest form (neurofibromatosis 1) appears in childhood and is characterized by flat, light brown-colored birthmarks on the skin: Café au lait spots can be present at birth or appear during childhood and then stabilize. They can be treated with lasers but often return. [9] X Research source In addition to birthmarks, neurofibromatosis 1 may be characterized by freckling in the armpit, soft bumps on or under the skin (neurofibromas or benign tumors), tiny, harmless bumps on the eye (called Lisch nodules), and/or bone deformities. The two other types (neurofibromatosis 2 and 3) are much less common than the first type and are characterized by more serious symptoms and tumors. If you suspect your child has neurofibromatosis, consult the pediatrician. Neurofibromatosis can't be cured, but your child’s pediatrician will monitor the complications and treat the symptoms."
