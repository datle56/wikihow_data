      "content": "Find and mark the induration. Use your fingertips to find the induration. This is a hard, dense, raised formation with definite borders. If there is a firm bump, use a pen to mark the widest edges of the induration on the forearm. The only part that is important for your test results is the hard bump. The reddened area or any slight swelling does not count towards the size of the induration. You cannot always see the induration. You must find the induration with your fingertips."

      "title": "Measure the induration.",
      "content": "Measure the induration. The test site may be red, but that does not mean you have TB. You have to measure the induration. This induration is measured across your forearm in millimeters. Use a ruler with millimeter measurements. Place the ruler's edge with \"0\" on the left edge of the raised bump where you marked it with a pen. Look where the mark made on the right side of the bump falls on the ruler. Use the lower measurement if the mark is between two different lines."
