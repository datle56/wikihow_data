Use a ruler to keep your lines straight as you draw. [1] X Research source The grid should have 100 squares in all—1 for each bet. If you don’t want to draw the grid, create one in a word processing program or download a pre-made football squares grid and print it out on 8 in × 10 in (20 cm × 25 cm) printer paper."

Each square represents a potential score outcome for the game. [2] X Research source Some people number the board in a random order after players buy squares since certain numbers (like 0, 3, and 7) are more likely to win. If you number the board after the squares are sold, wait until the players are gathered together, and use a random method like drawing numbers from a hat to make sure it’s fair for everyone."

Write the name of the other team on the side of the board. Their scores will be reflected by the numbers written on that side.

Ask each player if they’d like to purchase more than one square. If you can, try to distribute an equal amount of squares per person so everyone has about the same chance of winning.

You can either ask players which square they want and write in their initials for them, or let them come up to the board to choose and write their initials themselves. [7] X Research source If you want to randomize the game, draw numbers from a hat instead of letting players pick their own number. [8] X Research source If two people have the same initials, use their first names or short nicknames to avoid confusion."

At the end of each quarter, look at the last digit of the score for the team written across the top of the board and find the column for that number. Then, look at the last digit of the score for the team written on the side of the board and find the row with that number. The winner is the person who bought the square where that row and column meet. Let’s say you have the Green Bay Packers written at the top of the board and the Texas Longhorns on the side of the board. During the first quarter, the Packers score a 10, while the Longhorns score 15. The winner for that quarter would have chosen the square in column 0 (the second digit of the Packers score) and row 5 (the second digit of the Longhorns score)."
