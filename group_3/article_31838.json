      "content": "Choose your “vessel. ” You can have a burrito in a large flour tortilla, crispy or soft corn tacos or soft flour tacos. If you don’t want any tortillas, you can order a burrito bowl or a salad. You can choose to order a “double-wrapped burrito” with two flour tortilla shells at no additional charge. This is best to do if you like more of a bite or if you plan on piling your burrito too high to wrap with just one tortilla. The standard “tacos” orders will get you three tacos with the choice of soft flour or corn tortillas or crispy fried corn taco shells. You can also order a “single taco” or \"two tacos\" as long as you specify it at the beginning of your order."

You can ask for a little more or less protein if you feel like the 4 oz serving doesn't suit your tastes but keep in mind that you will be charged extra if you ask for a double serving of meat, and if you choose to get less than a serving, you'll get charged for the 4 ounces. Braised pork carnitas, the CEO, Steve Ells' favorite and the least spicy meat. Adobo-marinated grilled chicken, the second least spiciest meat and the most popular protein option. Sofritas, Chipotle's vegan protein option. Made from poblano peppers and tofu, sofritas packs a punch. Barbacoa, shredded beef, the second spiciest meat on the menu. Adobo-marinated steak. There is no spicier meat in the entire restaurant. Milder tastes beware!"
