      "title": "The number 8 represents new beginnings in the Bible.",
      "content": "The number 8 represents new beginnings in the Bible. Eight follows the number 7, which symbolizes completion or perfection—so 8 represents what comes after that completion. It can mean rebirth, the start of a new week, or resurrection. It’s also associated with Jesus, his resurrection, and his second coming—which is fitting, since he represents forgiveness and a fresh start for all mankind. [1] X Research source Eight can also represent abundance. The word for “eight” in Hebrew is “sh’moneh,” which comes from the root word “shah’meyn,” which means to fatten or cover something with fat.

      "title": "Eight people were saved from the Great Flood in the ark.",
      "content": "Eight people were saved from the Great Flood in the ark. Genesis 6:13–9:29 tells the story of Noah, who built an ark to save his family and the world’s animals from a Great Flood. According to the story, the only people to survive the flood were Noah, his wife, and their three sons and their wives—8 in total. [3] X Research source The story of the Great Flood symbolizes God’s desire to start over because of “how great the wickedness of the human race had become on earth” (Genesis 6:5). The 8 members of Noah’s family represent a new beginning for humanity. 1 Peter 3:19–20 says, \"God waited patiently in the days of Noah while the ark was being built. In it only a few people, 8 in all, were saved through water.\""

      "content": "Male babies should be circumcised 8 days after birth. In Genesis 17:9–14, God tells Abraham, “For the generations to come every male among you who is eight days old must be circumcised.” This act is a symbol of the covenant between God and Abraham—Abraham agrees that his people will follow the Lord, and God promises to protect Abraham and his descendants. [4] X Research source This covenant is the beginning of the Hebrew people, so we again see the number 8 associated with a fresh start. The number 8 here may also be significant because by waiting until the baby’s 8th day to perform the circumcision ceremony, it ensures that he has experienced a Sabbath—undergoing his first holy experience and beginning his relationship with God."

      "title": "Jesus was resurrected 8 days after entering Jerusalem.",
      "content": "Jesus was resurrected 8 days after entering Jerusalem. All 4 Gospels (Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John) describe Jesus entering Jerusalem on Palm Sunday. He spent a few days with his followers, then was arrested on Thursday and crucified on Good Friday. He rose again on Easter Sunday—the 8th day after he arrived. [5] X Research source Jesus’ resurrection is the ultimate symbol of rebirth. It represents a fresh start for all of humanity and the beginning of a new relationship with God where our sins are already forgiven."

      "content": "Jesus’ name adds up to 888 in Greek. In the Greek language, letters also represent numbers. So, if you write out Jesus’ name in Greek—Ιησουσ, or Iesous—and substitute the letters for numbers, you get the following (which adds up to 888): [6] X Research source I/I (Iota) = 10, η/e (Eta) = 8, σ/s (Sigma) = 200, ο/o (Omicron) = 70, υ/u (Upsilon) = 400, σ/s (Sigma) = 200 This is thought to be contrasted with the number of the beast, which is 666."

      "content": "The holiday Sukkot lasts for a total of 8 days. In Judaism, Sukkot—or the Feast of Tabernacles—is a fall harvest festival that lasts for 7 days. The last day of the Feast, the 8th day, is known as the Last Great Day. This is a separate yet connected holiday, and it’s treated as a solemn occasion in the Hebrew faith. According to Leviticus 23:36, when God is giving Moses instructions on how to observe Sukkot, He says: “On the eighth day hold a sacred assembly and present a food offering to the Lord.” [7] X Research source Traditionally, people gave these food offerings on the Last Great Day as a prayer that the following year would provide a successful harvest—another new beginning.
