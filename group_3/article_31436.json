Child support is designed to allow a child to enjoy a standard of living that is approximate to what he or she would have enjoyed had the parents lived together. Child support may be ordered when the parents are separated, have never lived together, or are in divorce, dissolution of marriage, annulment, or in the midst of paternity and legal separation cases. [1] X Research source Typically, it is paid to the parent with whom the children spend the majority of their time. [2] X Research source Nolo’s Essential Guide to Child Custody &amp; Support, Emily Doskow (chapter 3). Child support is not alimony. The purpose of alimony is to rehabilitate or support a former spouse. Though the other parent may financially benefit from child support payments, the purpose of the payments is to benefit the children who no longer live with you. Once set, child support payments can only be modified by court order."

These formulas, however, are often only “guidelines,” which a judge can deviate from. [3] X Research source Nolo’s Essential Guide to Child Custody &amp; Support, Emily Doskow (chapter 3) Typically, courts can consider a variety of factors when setting child support payments: [4] X Research source Nolo’s Essential Guide to Child Custody &amp; Support, Emily Doskow (chapter 3). The parents’ income. Some states consider only the non-custodial parent’s income, while other courts consider both. Also, some states use “gross” income while others consider only “net” income (income after taxes and allowable deductions, such as taxes and/or union dues).

Most states will grant a non-custodial parent’s petition to temporarily suspend child support if the parent has lost his or her job or has become disabled and is in the process of applying for disability benefits. You are being incarcerated. Some states will allow temporary suspension for incarceration; however, other states will not. The child reaches the age of majority. In most states, a parent can stop paying when a child reaches the age of majority (18 in most states). However, in some states a parent is obligated to pay until the child reaches 21. The child dies.

You can always ask the court clerk what form you need to fill out. Although the court clerk cannot offer legal advice, he or she should be able to point you to the right form to fill out.

To appeal, you need to have some objection to the judge’s interpretation of the law or the judge’s understanding of the facts.

If you ask for custody, the court will look to a variety of factors to determine what is in the child’s “best interests.” These factors will differ by state. They will be listed in either a statute passed by the legislature or in a court opinion issued by your state supreme court. Courts will look at different factors, depending on state. Michigan, for example, considers: the love and affection existing between the parties and the child; the ability and willingness of the parties to provide food, shelter, clothing, and medical care; moral fitness of the parent; stability of the custodial environment; and mental and physical health of the parties, among other factors. Among a variety of factors, Kentucky considers the wishes of the child; the child’s adjustment to home, school, and community; the mental and physical health of all individuals involved; as well as the interaction and interrelationship of the child to each parent and to siblings. To find the specific factors for your state, search online for “best interests of the child” and then your state."

Sometimes, parental rights will be terminated but support obligations will remain. To find your state’s statues: Check your state’s website. Many state websites provide users with a searchable state code or a link to the state code on another reputable website. Use the Internal Revenue Service’s State Links page to find your state’s website. Use your favorite search engine. You may locate your state’s code by running a search at your favorite search engine. Search “YOUR STATE code.” For example, if you live in New York, you would search for “New York code.” Check with an attorney. It is a risk to abandon your child. First, the state can still garnish your wages if they can find you. Second, the court could put you in prison for non-payment of child support as well as suspend your driver’s license or put liens on any property you own."
