      "title": "Train extensively weeks before the race.",
      "content": "Train extensively weeks before the race. By developing a training regimen you'll be able to improve your time drastically. Try doing the following exercises to train for a 5K. [1] X Research source Run up hills. Be sure to be perpendicular to the hill and lift your knees, using the proper healthy running form. Run intervals. Run the mile four times, an 800 six times, a 600 eight times, or a 400 ten times. Vary these. Miles should be close to race pace with 3-5 minutes rest intervals. The 600s and 800s work best at 5 seconds per 400 faster than race pace and 2-3 minutes rest interval. 400s in 86-92 would develop adequate speed. Rest 1:30 between each 400 Practice speeding up when you run. Run a comfortable pace then speed up for about 50 to 100 meters then slow down again. Repeat. Run hard courses. Most people do not run very fast when practicing so it is best to run hard courses to still speed up. If the weather is not great, you can train on a treadmill using a level 2 or 3 inclination."

      "content": "Take time to recover. Don't overtrain. Remember it takes your body 3-4 days to recover from a reps session. Ideally, do this on a Monday or Tuesday and race on a Saturday. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Keep track of your training times.",
      "content": "Keep track of your training times. Running 5K in less than 20 minutes requires running at 6:26 pace for 3.1 miles (5.0 km). You need to be able to run at least a 6:00 mile before you run this 5k in under 20 minutes. This alone still won't guarantee you your goal time. You must train regularly."

    {
      "title": "Rest before the big race.",
      "content": "Rest before the big race. Do not do push-ups, pull-ups or any other strenuous activities. Just stretch and spend time relaxing. [3] X Research source Eat whole wheat pasta for dinner. Muscles receive energy from glucose which is found in pasta, and the complex carbs will help fuel you for the race. Go to bed early and make sure you get enough good-quality rest before your big race. It's important to be well-rested in the days prior to the race. It's common to get the nerves the night before, but if you're resting consistently, it won't matter as much. Wake up early. Save yourself enough time to eat a good, but light breakfast at least an hour before the race."

    {
      "title": "Warm up.",
      "content": "Warm up. If it is cold on race day, keep your muscles warm by stretching. [4] X Research source Do some quick sprints up to 100m right before the race. Do dynamic stretching beforehand, not static. Dynamic is more moving (i.e. Lunges) and static is more still (i.e. Touching your toes)."

      "title": "Start fast but not too fast.",
      "content": "Start fast but not too fast. You don't want to run out of gas early. Try to find someone at your pace and settle yourself near the front at the start. Pick an athlete just in front of you who looks experienced - grey-haired vets are ideal - imagine a rope between the two of you and that rope shortening until you are on their shoulder."

[5] X Research source Your first mile should be about 6:25, but preferably faster. Get your second-mile split. It should be under 13:00."
