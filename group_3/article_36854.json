      "title": "The adhesive breaks down over time.",
      "content": "The adhesive breaks down over time. Your car’s headliner is actually made with 2 different materials—polyurethane, a foam-like layer that goes directly over your car ceiling, and a layer of fabric that goes on top of the polyurethane. This headliner stays in place with an adhesive; over time, as the glue breaks down, the headliner starts to droop and sag off your car’s ceiling. [1] X Research source Typically, car headliner starts to sag after 10-15 years."

      "title": "Glue the edges and sides back into place with a spray adhesive.",
      "content": "Glue the edges and sides back into place with a spray adhesive. If your headliner is sagging along the edge of your car ceiling, a quick touch of glue can do the trick. Spray the loose, peeling underside of the headliner with the adhesive, along with the exposed section of ceiling. Wait 5 minutes for the glue to get tacky, and then press the material back into place. Some people like to spray on 2 coats of adhesive for extra security."

      "title": "Secure loose edges with double-sided tape.",
      "content": "Secure loose edges with double-sided tape. Stick 1 section of double-side tape along the peeling underside of the headliner. Then, stick the tape onto your car’s roof. This is an easy fix for any peeling sections along the edges of your headliner. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Use pins for a quick fix.",
      "content": "Use pins for a quick fix. If your headliner is sagging badly, you’re better off replacing it altogether. However, if you’re in a rush, stick a couple of pins through the drooping material to hold it in place. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "A high-temperature adhesive spray is best.",
      "content": "A high-temperature adhesive spray is best. Spray glue is easy to apply in an even layer, and helps your headliner stick firmly to the backing board. Professionals recommend using a high-temperature adhesive—about 2 cans are enough for a standard sedan, but you might need more if you’re repairing a larger vehicle. Professionals recommend using 3M-brand “hi-tack” adhesive spray for headliner repairs. You can also use an adhesive spray designed specifically for car headliners, too. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "You’ll need to replace the entire headliner.",
      "content": "You’ll need to replace the entire headliner. Unfortunately, there’s no quick or handy way to re-glue the center of your headliner onto the backing board. [5] X Research source Instead, you’ll need to remove the headliner completely and replace it with new fabric. [6] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Detach any accessories from your headliner first.",
      "content": "Detach any accessories from your headliner first. Sun visors, grab handles, car lights, and other accessories are typically attached to the top and upper sides of your car. Before removing the headliner and backing board, unscrew all these attachments and set them aside for later. Depending on your vehicle, you may need an electric drill, pliers, screwdrivers, and/or a hex tool socket kit to remove these accessories. [7] X Research source"

      "title": "Pull down the plastic pillars and sills.",
      "content": "Pull down the plastic pillars and sills. Find 4 plastic “pillars,” or sections of plastic layered over your car’s headliner, along the front and back of your vehicle. Remove any plugs or screws holding these pillars in place. [8] X Research source Then, pull off any sills, or rubber strips, along the sides of your car doors. [9] X Research source You don’t have to remove the pillars! The pillars only cover about 1 in (2.5 cm) of the headliner material—so, you can shift and pull out the old headliner without detaching them completely. [10] X Research source"

      "title": "Remove the headliner and backing board from the car entirely.",
      "content": "Remove the headliner and backing board from the car entirely. Grip the headliner and backing board with both hands, removing them completely from the top of the car. Open up multiple car doors, so it’s easy to slide the backing board and headliner out. [11] X Research source"

      "title": "Disconnect any wires and sunglasses cases.",
      "content": "Disconnect any wires and sunglasses cases. Flip the backing board over and place it on a flat surface. Unscrew any wires still attached to the board, setting them aside for later. Additionally, unscrew and remove any sunglasses cases from the headliner—these are pretty fragile, and will likely break if you leave them attached. [12] X Research source Always reattach these screws, wires, and cases before placing your headliner and backing board back in the car."

      "title": "Flat-knit and velour fabrics are both great options.",
      "content": "Flat-knit and velour fabrics are both great options. Flat-knit headliners have a “stitched” design, while velour materials are softer to the touch. Both of these materials come attached to a layer of foam, which goes directly on the backing board. [13] X Research source These fabrics come in different colors—feel free to pick one that matches your car’s interior. You can find headliner fabric at specialty shops, or at stores that sell auto supplies or fabrics, like Walmart and Hobby Lobby. It typically costs over $10 per yard."

      "title": "Remove the foam from the headliner board.",
      "content": "Remove the foam from the headliner board. Grab a bristled brush and scrub off the old foam. Clear away the foam completely, so the backing board is completely bare. Then, smooth away any raised sections or imperfections on the backing board with a sander. [15] X Research source An air blower or air hose can help with this."

      "content": "Glue a new section of fabric in place. Spray down the entire backing board with adhesive glue, as well as the underside of the new headliner material. [16] X Research source Wait 5 minutes, so the glue gets nice and sticky. [17] X Research source Use your hands to press and smooth the headliner over all the contours and raised sections of the backing board, so the material looks seamless and wrinkle-free. Then, let the glue dry and cure completely. [18] X Research source Check your glue can for more specific drying and curing guidance."

Carefully cut around any sections where car accessories go, like your interior lights, grab handles, and sun visors. These sections appear slightly raised beneath the material and are easy to locate and cut out. [19] X Research source"
