Check in between flowers as wilted blossoms may sink between full ones. Checking your petunias more than once a week is okay, but not necessary."

      "content": "Pinch and remove deadheads. Position your forefinger and thumb about 0.25 inches (0.64 cm) above the bud of a deadhead. Pinch the wilted bloom and pull it very gently to remove it. Do not pull the deadhead roughly, as it should come off the plant very easily. [2] X Research source Be sure to remove the entire head of the flower and not just the petals. [3] X Research source Removing deadheads prevents the plants from going to seed, which would prevent them from blooming."

      "content": "Cut sinking stems to half of their length to encourage regrowth. If you notice shoots that look limp and are not growing flowers, trim them down immediately. Use pruning shears to cut the stems at their halfway point. This should leave at least 2 inches (5.1 cm) of stem from the base of the plant. [5] X Research source Do not remove any remaining leaves on the stem."

      "content": "Trim limp stems down to 2 inches (5.1 cm) from the base if they are damaged. During your weekly check, you can remove more than half of a limp stem if it looks unhealthy. Use pruning shears to cut away as much of the damaged stem as possible. Make sure that at least 2 inches (5.1 cm) of it remains above the surface of the soil. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Cut down a third of your plants every other week, if you have a large crop. You can cut down your plants regularly, regardless of whether stems are damaged or not, to promote greater growth. Each trimmed stem will branch out and give 3 or 4 new blooms within 2-3 days. Remove the bulk of the stems, leaving at least 2 inches (5.1 cm) to regrow. [7] X Research source This is an effective way to remove deadheads if you have too many plants to pinch off individual deadheads one at a time."

Spray a 10-10-10 solution or all-purpose fertilizer into the soil around the plants. Applying 1-2 sprays around each plant should be sufficient to fertilize the soil and encourage regrowth within a week. [8] X Research source A 10-10-10 solution contains 3 main nutrients- nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. Do not apply too much fertilizer, as it can be harmful to your plants in large doses. Use fertilizer no more than once a week."

Water the plants moderately each day or second day so that the soil is damp but not soaked. Let the soil dry slightly between watering to avoid root rot. [10] X Research source"

If you are growing petunias in a garden, space them out about 3 inches (7.6 cm) apart. Petunias have large blooms and need enough room to develop fully and stay healthy. [11] X Research source"
