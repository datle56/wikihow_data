      "title": "Shut off the circuit breaker or fuse.",
      "content": "Shut off the circuit breaker or fuse. If the power to your machine was interrupted, the machine may get buggy and require a reset. With the machine turned on, cut the energy off abruptly by flipping the fuse for the outlet your washing machine is plugged into or flipping the circuit breaker for your home off. [1] X Research source This process is ideal if there was some kind of cycle error or if there was a power interruption to your machine."

      "title": "Unplug the washing machine and wait 2 minutes.",
      "content": "Unplug the washing machine and wait 2 minutes. Reach behind your washing machine and pull the plug. If your machine is tucked into a closet, slide it out far enough that you can reach behind. Then, wait at least 2 minutes. [2] X Research source If you have a model with a timer control knob, turn it back to any position other than “final spin” after you unplug the machine."

      "title": "Restore the power and run a new cycle.",
      "content": "Restore the power and run a new cycle. Flip the circuit breaker or fuse back on to restore power to the outlet near the washing machine. Them, plug the machine back into the outlet and press the power button. Your washer should now work as intended and you can run a fresh cycle. [3] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Unplug the washing machine and wait 1 minute.",
      "content": "Unplug the washing machine and wait 1 minute. Don’t shut the power to the machine off at the panel. Instead, unplug the washing machine from the wall. You’re going to have to make a bunch of quick movements after you plug the machine back in, so pull it away from the wall if you need some extra room to work. [4] X Research source You may want to reset the motor if your drum won’t spin but the electrical panels and components all work as intended. On some GE models, the motor will shut off and need to be reset if the machine has a power surge or the motor cuts out because it senses an uneven load."

    {
      "title": "Plug the washer back in and quickly lift the lid up and down 6 times.",
      "content": "Plug the washer back in and quickly lift the lid up and down 6 times. Lift and lower the lid 6 times in under 12 seconds. Each time you lift the lid, it must be at least 2 inches (5.1 cm) off of the magnetic closure that holds the lid in place, and the lid must close entirely with each lift or it won’t count. [5] X Research source Yes, these are GE’s official instructions. No, we don’t know the logic behind it. If you don’t get the perfect 6-rep lift sequence right, unplug the machine and try again."
    },
    {
      "title": "Choose a new cycle and run the washer like you normally would.",
      "content": "Choose a new cycle and run the washer like you normally would. Once you get the 6-rep lift pattern correct, close the lid and wait for your washing machine to stop making noises. Then, you’re all good to go! Your motor has been reset and you can start a new cycle. [6] X Research source If your machine malfunctioned because you overloaded it or the clothes were really lopsided in the drum, take everything out and refill the drum with fewer clothes. If the motor keeps shutting down despite the smaller loads, it’s a sign the motor isn’t working correctly and your machine needs to be serviced."

      "title": "Press the power button to turn the machine on.",
      "content": "Press the power button to turn the machine on. Open the SmartHQ app and then turn the machine on. This process is best if you’ve already tried resetting your router and reconnecting the machine in the app. If you haven’t done those two things first, start there. [7] X Research source If this is your first time using the washing machine and it won’t connect to the WiFi, your machine is probably too far from the router. Get a WiFi extender or move the router to fix this problem."

      "title": "Press and hold the Temp button until the washer turns off.",
      "content": "Press and hold the Temp button until the washer turns off. As soon as you turn the machine’s power on, press and hold the “Temp” button (if you have a “WiFi” button, press that instead). Continue holding the button until the machine powers down and the WiFi indicator comes on. [8] X Research source If this isn’t doing anything, refer to your specific washer’s manual. GE uses a few fringe methods on some of their models."

      "title": "Go into your GE app and reconnect the washer to the router.",
      "content": "Go into your GE app and reconnect the washer to the router. If the light on the WiFi indicator is solid, the app can’t find the appliance. Close the app and reopen it. Then, reconnect to your appliance. If the light is flashing, the password or home network is incorrect. Select “Retry” in your app and enter the WiFi info again. [9] X Research source"
