Airline shipping is particularly convenient if you plan on travelling with your shipment as not all airline shipping services offer residential deliveries and pickups. [1] X Research source Contact your airline and ask about their cargo freighting methods, costs, and customs policies. Ask questions like “I’m shipping a package that weighs around 300 lbs., will I be able to freight in my flight’s cargo?”, “How many packages can I ship on my flight specifically?”, “What are the plane’s weight and size restrictions?” [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Weigh your shipment.",
      "content": "Weigh your shipment. Weigh the items you plan on shipping by using a scale. This can be done at your chosen shipping service, like UPS or DHL, or can be done at home on a bathroom scale. Place your item on the scale and write down its exact weight. Some carriers only ask for whole numbers when asking for the package weight. In this case, round your package’s weight up to the nearest whole number. For example, if your package is 18.5 pounds it should be rounded to 19 pounds. If your item is too large to view the scale you may have to weigh it at one of your shipping carrier’s stores. Alternatively, you can weigh yourself, hold the package and step onto your scale, and subtract your weight from the combined weight to get an estimate of how much your package weighs."

Use your own discretion to determine how much you think your package is worth. Every shipping service is different. Ask your shipping service what their liabilities are, what maximum value can be declared, and what range of value they recommend shipping without insurance. Ask your shipping service questions like, “What is the maximum value I can declare for a package?”, “What are your fees for declaring maximum value?”, or “What value range do you recommend for the items I am shipping?”"
