If a baby doesn't follow objects with its eyes by 3 months, this could be a very early indicator of autism. Observe their other facial expressions. By 9 months old, babies communicate with others by displaying certain expressions like grimacing, pouting and grinning to fit their mood."

      "content": "Consider when your child begins speaking. Some autistic children experience a delay in speaking, or never learn to speak at all. Around 15-20% of autistic people never speak, [7] X Research source although this does not mean they do not communicate. By one year, non-autistic children are able to say single words such as \"Mama\" and \"Dada\". By age 2, most children are able to string words together. A typical 2-year-old should have a vocabulary of more than 15 words."

A non-autistic child responds to its own name at about one year old. By 18 months, a typical child will start to play \"pretend\" games, such as pretend feeding a baby doll. Autistic children tend not to play pretend, and may appear unimaginative to onlookers. By age two, non-autistic children will imitate your words and actions. Pay attention to speech regression. Some infants meet their milestones and then lose skills at an older age."

Autistic children may be less active. By 6 months old, children should turn their head towards sounds they hear. If your child does not do this they may have a hearing problem, or early symptoms of autism. Many babies start waving bye-bye and pointing to objects they want by the time they are 12 months old. If your child has not started to walk or crawl by 12 months, this is a very serious developmental disability. [12] X Trustworthy Source Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Main public health institute for the US, run by the Dept. of Health and Human Services Go to source By age 1, most babies will start to use gestures such as shaking their head to say \"no\".

Autistic children may not want to join group activities, either because it's hard or because they aren't interested.

Reversing pronouns (using \"you\" instead of \"I\") is another common trait of children who have ASD. Many autistic people don't understand jokes, sarcasm, or teasing. Some autistic people may develop speech later, or not at all. They can live happy and functional lives, using alternative communication such as typing, sign language, or picture exchange. Early intervention can help an autistic child learn how to use these tools."
