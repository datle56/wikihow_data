      "title": "Trim your armpit hair.",
      "content": "Trim your armpit hair. Before you shave down to the skin, it can be helpful to clear out as much long, bushy growth as you can, especially if this is your first time shaving your armpits. The quickest way to do this is to simply run an electric beard trimmer over your underarms to clip the hair down to about a quarter inch. Afterwards, the remaining stubble will be much easier to remove. [1] X Research source Set the length guard on the trimmer one or two notches above the shortest setting. This will prevent the blades from pulling the hair as you go over it. Assuming you don’t own a beard trimmer, you can also use a pair of sharp grooming scissors—just be careful to avoid pokes and nicks."

    {
      "title": "Hop in the shower.",
      "content": "Hop in the shower. When you’re done trimming, climb into a hot shower and scrub up. The heat of the water will help soften the texture of your underarm hair, making it easier for the razor to get through it. Start shaving as soon as you get out of the shower while the hair is still soft, or just go ahead and get the job done while you shower. [2] X Research source If you’re unable to take a shower, splash some warm water onto your armpits right before you shave. Massage your underarm skin gently to help open up your pores."
    },
    {
      "title": "Grab a sharp razor.",
      "content": "Grab a sharp razor. Not just any old razor will do for tackling your underarms. You’ll want to make sure you’re using a new razor, or that you’ve recently changed out the blade cartridge. A sharp edge will make the whole process quicker and more efficient. Dull, overused blades can tug the hair and scrape at your skin, causing irritation. Look for razors with multiple blades. Since these remove more hair per stroke, they tend to provide a much closer and smoother shave overall. [3] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Apply a liberal amount of shaving cream.",
      "content": "Apply a liberal amount of shaving cream. Spritz a handful of lubricating shaving cream or gel and glob it directly onto your underarms. No need to be shy—the more you use, the better a shave you’ll get. [4] X Research source Shaving creams and gels stimulate the hair follicles, allow the razor to glide more effortlessly and protect your skin from abrasions. [5] X Research source Feel free to reapply gel as needed once you get underway."
    },
    {
      "title": "Raise your arm over your head.",
      "content": "Raise your arm over your head. This will give you a clear path to the underarm hair. It can also help to pull the skin taut so that there are no wrinkles or folds to get in the way. The idea is to make the shaving surface as flat and even as possible. [6] X Research source If you’re having trouble getting a good view of your armpits, try shaving with a mirror. Keep your fingers out of the way of the razor."
    },
    {
      "title": "Shave the hair in every direction.",
      "content": "Shave the hair in every direction. Drag the head of the razor along your underarm, starting at the top. Then, shave from the bottom up and from side-to-side. Use long, smooth, straight strokes and try to take off as much hair as you can with each pass. [7] X Research source Take your time to avoid any potentially painful accidents. Armpit hair tends to sprout in multiple directions, which means it won’t always have a normal “grain” like other body hair."
    },
    {
      "title": "Rinse out your razor blade periodically.",
      "content": "Rinse out your razor blade periodically. After every few strokes, hold the head of the razor under the faucet or shower stream to flush out the clumps of hair it’s collected. Keeping your blades clear will ensure that you’re cutting the hair instead of just tugging or tangling it. [8] X Research source Don’t try to clear the razor by tapping it against a hard surface. This can damage the blades over time. [9] X Research source If the blades become clogged, it may be necessary to clear them with a small brush or the corner of a washcloth."
    },
    {
      "title": "Repeat with the opposite underarm.",
      "content": "Repeat with the opposite underarm. When you’re finished shaving one side, move on to the other. Be sure to take your time and rinse out your razor every so often. Keep shaving until no visible hair remains."
    },
    {
      "title": "Rinse with cold water.",
      "content": "Rinse with cold water. When you’re satisfied with your shave, run or splash some cool water over your armpits. This will wash away loose hairs and shaving cream residue while soothing your skin and closing up your pores at the same time. Pat your underarms gently with a towel to dry them. If you’re shaving in the shower, just turn the water temperature down for a few moments while you finish rinsing off. Cold water will also cut down on inflammation from the combination of hot water and razor rash."
    },
    {
      "title": "Follow up with a moisturizer.",
      "content": "Follow up with a moisturizer. Dab a dime-sized portion of moisturizing lotion onto your freshly shaved armpits and rub it in completely. The right post-shave balm will provide immediate relief from irritation. And, as an added bonus, it will keep your underarms soft, smooth and smelling pleasant for days to come. [10] X Research source Go with a moisturizer that’s been formulated specifically for use on sensitive shave areas. [11] X Research source A splash of gentle antiseptic can also prevent bacteria from entering the sensitive follicles. Avoid putting on deodorant right away—it can make irritation worse."
