      "content": "Wait 4 to 6 hours to make sure the nest is abandoned. If you find a mouse nest with no mother, don’t immediately assume it's abandoned. It’s possible that you inadvertently frightened the mother away or she left to find food to eat. Leave the nest alone and check back after 4 to 6 hours. See if the mother returned by looking for a white band of fur on the baby or babies' bellies; this band shows up when baby mice are full of milk. If they don’t have a band, the mother didn’t return to feed them, and it’s unlikely that she will. [1] X Trustworthy Source The Humane Society of the United States National organization devoted to the promotion of animal welfare Go to source Leave the nest as undisturbed as possible. Mouse mothers typically return to their nest even if it’s been slightly messed with, but large disturbances can cause them to abandon their nest. If the mother didn’t return, she is either deceased or has abandoned her nest."

      "content": "Call a wildlife rehabilitator to see if they can care for the babies. If you find a baby wild mouse or an empty nest of baby mice, call your local wildlife rehabilitation office. Transferring the baby mouse to a wildlife professional is the best chance they have for survival. It might take the rehabilitator several hours or days to collect the baby, so ask them what they recommend doing to keep them alive. [2] X Research source If there is no rehabilitation office in your area, your next best option is to hand-feed the baby until they’re mature enough to release. When you call, ask the rehabilitator what they plan to do with the mice. They may try to raise them, or they may use them to feed other animals they are taking care of. If you don't want your baby mouse to wind up as owl food, care for them yourself."

      "content": "Place the baby mouse in a box lined with clean rags. Keep the baby or babies comfortable by giving them a dark, covered shelter to sleep in. Simply place soft, clean rags in a cardboard box. Trim off any loose threads on the rags that might become tangled around the mouse's legs. [4] X Research source Warning : always wash your hands after handling wild mice. They can carry a very dangerous, highly contagious virus called Hantavirus."

      "title": "Set a heating pad to low and place it under the box.",
      "content": "Set a heating pad to low and place it under the box. A baby mouse has a hard time regulating their temperature, so they need a heat source to stay warm at around 80-100°F (27-38°C). Turn a heating pad to its lowest setting and wrap it in a soft, clean towel or rag. Then, place it under the box where the mouse is resting. [5] X Research source Place a thermometer next to the mouse if you’re unsure whether it’s too hot or cold. Be sure the heating pad isn't too hot. If it feels even slightly hot to your hand, let it cool away from the box for a minute before placing it underneath it. If you don't have a heating pad , place a hot water bottle under the box. Or, fill a sock with rice and microwave it for 1 minute. Then, place the sock under the box. Just reheat the bottle or sock when they get cool. A healthy mouse maintains their own body temperature at about 2 and ½ weeks old, as long as their container is in a warm, indoor room. If the baby survives the first few days, transfer them to a glass or plastic ventilated container or small wire cage that they won't be able to chew through."

Unless you are certain the baby was with their mother less than an hour ago, rehydrate the baby before feeding them formula. Fill the syringe with a non-flavored electrolyte drink, such as Pedialyte . Feed the baby very carefully and slowly by placing 1 drop into their mouth at a time, stopping once they’ve had 3 to 4 drops. Then, wait an hour before feeding the baby formula.

Consult a chart that shows photos of a baby mouse as they develop, and match your mouse to one the same size in the pictures. [7] X Research source Baby mice start growing fur at about 3-5 days old. Baby mice open their eyes at around 10-14 days old. After a baby mouse opens their eyes, they enter the “flea” or “popcorn” stage. At this stage, they jump around a lot and are difficult to hold."

      "content": "Feed the baby warm kitten milk replacer while holding them upright. Prepare the formula in a bowl according to the package's instructions. Then, warm it in the microwave using 30-second intervals, testing it to make sure it's warm, not hot. Fill up your syringe and grasp the baby gently around their middle with their head at the top of your fingers. Slowly dispense the formula into the side of the baby’s mouth 1 drop at a time. [8] X Research source Alternatively, use a puppy milk replacer like Esbilac or a human milk replacers without iron, like Enfamil , Isomil, or Soyalac. If the baby mouse is having trouble drinking the formula, water it down by adding twice as much water. If the mouse is extremely small, use a new, clean fine-tip paintbrush instead of a syringe. Dip the brush into the formula, then dab it into the corner of the baby's mouth. Keeping the baby in a vertical position prevents aspiration, which is when liquid gets into their lungs and causes them to suffocate. Never rest the baby mouse on their back when you feed them. If you see a bubble come out of the baby's nose while feeding, immediately flip them upside down (tail up, head down) to prevent any more liquid from getting into their lungs. Sadly, a young baby mouse is unlikely to survive aspiration. There is a very slight chance that an older baby will survive if you turn them upside down immediately."

For example, a 10 gram (0.3 oz) baby mouse needs 0.5 cc of formula every time they feed. Just place the baby on a kitchen scale to find out how much they weigh. Then, use the cc measurements on your syringe to give the right amount of formula. [9] X Research source Look for the white band on the baby mouse’s belly to check if they’re full.

Because it’s often hard to tell how old they really are, just feed the baby according to the age they appear to be. In general, mice are fed in intervals according to their age: [11] X Trustworthy Source Animal Humane Society Leading animal welfare nonprofit organization providing medical care, training education, and resources for animal owners Go to source If the baby mouse’s eyes are still closed, feed them about every 2 hours, morning and night. At this stage, they’re between 0 to 14 days old. When the baby's eyes open at around 2 weeks old, feed them every 3 to 4 hours. When the baby is about 3 weeks old, they’re ready to eat solid foods."

If they aren’t encouraged to go, their waste builds up which can lead to death. After you feed the baby mouse, gently rub their belly, genitals, and anus with a fluffy cotton swab soaked in warm water for about 1 minute. [12] X Research source Be careful not to rub too hard or too much that you irritate the baby's skin. If the baby mouse doesn’t use the bathroom after several minutes, let them rest.

Place a small dish full of little bits of solid food so they have something to nibble on. Then, continue to offer them formula until they’re about 3 ½ to 4 weeks old. [13] X Research source Suitable hard foods include: premixed rodent food (hamster food is best), cooked rice (they usually prefer white over brown rice), human baby food, kitten food, apples, carrots, and seeds."

Hang a rodent water bottle on the side of their enclosure or cage, with the tip of the spout low enough that the mouse can reach it. Allow the mouse to find and use the water bottle on their own—it's okay if they don’t want to use it at first. Don't give the mouse water in a bowl as they can easily drown."

[19] X Research source If the babies have “milk bellies” (a visible white band or area on their stomach, which is the actual milk in their tummy), they are getting enough milk from the mother without your help. Check the babies several times a day during the first few days to make sure they have milk bellies and are not losing weight. Babies lose weight very quickly so they need to be fed right away."

Just make sure they’re mature enough to release, which is typically when they’re 6 weeks old or weigh 12 grams (0.4 oz). [22] X Research source This is a rough release guideline, so monitor your mouse’s progress to ensure they’re ready to release. If they’re easily eating hard food, running fast, and aren’t afraid to bite you if you get too close, they’re likely ready. Do not handle the mouse often or play with them to ensure they stay frightened of humans. If you release a wild mouse before they’re old enough, they might not have all the skills they need to survive."

Gently tip the mouse out of their enclosure in the covered area and watch them scamper off.
