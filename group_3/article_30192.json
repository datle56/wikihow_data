      "title": "Decide where you want your anime to be set.",
      "content": "Decide where you want your anime to be set. Is it going to be on an alien planet? Is it going to be in a place that is relatively similar to places on Earth? You don’t need to figure out everything about the entire world, but you do need to figure out where you want your story to occur. If you’re setting your anime in a real place, learn everything you can about the setting, from the weather to the culture and system of government. [1] X Research source For example, maybe you want the major action of your story to occur in a fictional world where most people live in caves because outside of caves there are a ton of dangerous slime pits that you could fall into."

      "title": "Develop interesting things about your world.",
      "content": "Develop interesting things about your world. Anime often have parts of their world that are slightly magical or strange in some way. Maybe pianos talk and give people lots of advice. Maybe there are flying beasts that people use to get from place to place. It doesn’t have to be something incredibly fantastical or something out of a science fiction novel—just pick something that works with your world and your story. For example, the magic of the world could be a simple folk tale that may or may not be true. Maybe in the slime pit world, there is a story that if you fall into a slime pit and survive, you’ll be granted special powers. No one knows if this is true or not."

      "title": "Consider the technological advancement of this world.",
      "content": "Consider the technological advancement of this world. Are the residents of your world living in apartment complexes or in wooden huts? Are they hunting for their food, or can they go out to dinner at restaurants? Obviously, there are a ton of other possibilities in between and beyond these examples. The technological status of your world will inform a lot of the ways that your characters interact with the problems that face them. [2] X Research source For example, if someone falls into a slime pit in a technologically advanced world, maybe it’s no big deal because everyone wears anti-slime suits."

      "title": "Decide your characters’ names, personalities, and looks.",
      "content": "Decide your characters’ names, personalities, and looks. Names can be changed down the line, but it’s helpful to have placeholders. To choose personalities, imagine how each character would behave in your world. Maybe you have one character that is really intelligent and perceptive, but prone to losing their temper. Sketch drafts of your characters, and try to make their appearance match their personality. [3] X Trustworthy Source Science Direct Online archive of peer-reviewed research on scientific, technical and medical topics Go to source Other factors to consider when developing a character are age, race, gender, education, and socio-economic status (the class they are in the anime’s society). All of these factors will influence their look or their personality. [4] X Research source Looks can inform a character’s personality and vice versa. For example, maybe the very muscular character is the hero. Conversely, maybe the very muscular character is a total coward. Either way, his body informs his personality in an interesting way."

      "title": "Choose a protagonist.",
      "content": "Choose a protagonist. You don’t need to have just one main character, but it’s nice to give the reader somebody to root for. Most anime have a protagonist, someone that’s relatable—even if they have magical powers. Decide which of your characters is the most interesting to you, and what potential story arc they could have, to pick a protagonist. [5] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Consider giving them special abilities.",
      "content": "Consider giving them special abilities. Anime often feature characters with special abilities accomplishing extraordinary things. It might be a good idea to give your main character some kind of power that will help him or her deal with whatever the problem in your anime is going to be. Your character doesn’t have to be able to fly or have super strength—find something small and interesting that helps the character deal with unique challenges. For example, maybe your character is incredibly brave! That’s a special ability, but it isn’t magic. Another way to think of it is to identify your character’s strengths, whether they’re supernatural or normal traits."

      "title": "Create relationships between the characters.",
      "content": "Create relationships between the characters. Family members, love interests, and friends of your protagonist should all play a major role in your anime’s story. These are the strongest connections that people have with others and they help motivate, inspire, and create conflict. To tell a good story in your anime, you need relationships that people will care about. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Figure out each character's motivation.",
      "content": "Figure out each character's motivation. The other characters can play into your characters' motivation, but find a unique thing that drives them. It can be graduating from school, getting a girlfriend, or even saving the world from disaster—it just has to be something that the protagonist is very passionate about."
    },
    {
      "title": "Decide on your protagonist’s character arc.",
      "content": "Decide on your protagonist’s character arc. A character arc should allow the main character to undergo some sort of minor transformation or come to a realization. Character arcs don’t need to be a complete change in personality, but you don’t want your character just running around doing activities without growing as a person. For example, maybe your protagonist is selfish at the beginning of the story. After helping save his brother, he starts to realize that he really does care about other people but that he was shutting himself off to the world."

      "title": "Think of a beginning, middle, and end to your anime.",
      "content": "Think of a beginning, middle, and end to your anime. Keeping a loose idea of the story’s organization in mind will help you write the whole plot, including all the scenes that take you from beginning to end. Look at anime, films, or books you like and figure out what the beginning, middle and end of those stories are. This can help you get a sense of common plot points (or ‘beats’) your anime could include. For example, maybe the beginning of your anime has the protagonist’s little brother falling in a slime pit. The middle could be when your protagonist decides to travel alone into the slime pit wearing an anti-slime suit to try to find his little brother. The end would be the thrilling conclusion where the slime demons living in the slime pit allow only one of the brothers to leave, and your protagonist stays behind so that his little brother can go home. If you want your anime to stand out in the crowd, it has to have a great concept, structure, and character. Since there’s a lot of competition, it's not enough to have a great concept without a good structure or captivating characters, says professional writer Lucy V. Hay."

      "title": "Write your anime’s script, including dialogue.",
      "content": "Write your anime’s script, including dialogue. Once you’ve crafted a story and character arc, you must turn it into a screenplay . Use a professional program like Final Draft or learn how to format a script in Microsoft Word or Google Docs. When writing dialogue, try to make conversations as realistic as possible. Think about the way you talk and use that as inspiration. Conversations are rarely direct. They sway and change the subject constantly. Figure out a way to add authenticity, and humor to your dialogue, by having characters switch subjects or creatively argue or flirt with one another. [7] X Research source"

      "title": "Revise your script and tie up loose ends.",
      "content": "Revise your script and tie up loose ends. Read through your script and decide if the plot flows naturally, the protagonist undergoes a character arc, and there aren’t any plot threads you forgot to address. If there was a love interest at the beginning of the story, there should be some acknowledgment of them at the end of the story. Not everything needs to tie up perfectly, but you want your anime to feel well-planned and satisfying. If you’re unsure how to revise, ask a trusted friend or relative to read your script. Listen thoughtfully and openly to their feedback. If they have questions about a character, scene, or part of the plot, it’s usually a sign you need to rewrite and make it clearer."

    {
      "title": "Think of a good title.",
      "content": "Think of a good title. The title is what catches people's attention. Make sure the title has something to do with the plot. For example, if your anime is about a protagonist who sacrifices himself to save his brother in a futuristic slime world, the title could be the name of the world they live in—for example, “Planet Slime.” It could also be a reference to the events of the story, such as, “My Brother and the Slime Pit.”"

      "title": "Hire voice actors and record your dialogue.",
      "content": "Hire voice actors and record your dialogue. Before you begin animating, you need to get audio. This will help make sure the animation for talking syncs up with the timing of line delivery and conveys the proper emotion. Recruit friends and family to record lines, or hire professional voice actors to do the job. Edit the audio together in a software like Adobe Audition where you can review takes and order lines properly. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Create storyboards to develop your anime’s visual style. A storyboard is a series of rough sketches that suggest camera angles, the order of events, and the style and pacing of your anime. The sketches are usually accompanied by a brief description of what’s happening in that image/scene and how it will appear to the viewer. Create a storyboard based on your script, using pencil and paper or a digital art software. [9] X Research source Your storyboard doesn’t have to be perfect. Sketch roughly, focusing on what you imagine being on the screen at each pivotal moment in a scene. Make a storyboard for every scene in your script to guide you during the animation process. It’s like a blueprint for the visual component of your anime."

      "title": "Draw and animate keyframes for characters.",
      "content": "Draw and animate keyframes for characters. Use digital keyframe animation to animate faster than drawing every frame by hand. To begin, you must draw keyframes (frames that show the start and end of a movement) of your character’s common poses, actions, and reactions. Draw the first frame and last frame of each movement in your digital art software, such as Adobe Animate . Follow your software’s instructions to use digital keyframe animation. [10] X Research source The most important action is talking. Some animators create separate key frames for physical movements and facial movements like talking or facial expressions. That way, you can combine them later in the animation process. Make sure such facial movements match the dialogue audio. If you’d rather draw frame by frame for more traditional animation, keyframes can still be useful as start- and end-points. Draw the keyframes in your software, then impose them side by side. Create new frames to fill in the in-between motions or movement between the keyframes. [11] X Research source 2D animation (such as anime) is usually presented at the rate of 24 frames per second. Your first keyframe is frame 1, while your last keyframe is frame 24. When drawing frame by frame, you can include up to 24 frames in one second of animation (animating on ones).

      "title": "Color in your frames.",
      "content": "Color in your frames. Keep a palette in your animation software for each character so you can easily select the same colors for every frame. Make sure to color in every detail—such as their eye color or socks. Don’t worry about lighting and shading just yet."

      "title": "Draw backgrounds for all your locations.",
      "content": "Draw backgrounds for all your locations. Use the same software—for example, Adobe Animate—to illustrate the backgrounds for the scenes in your anime. Most anime use the same locations more than once. This is good news, as it means less work for you. Keep principles of art in mind when drawing your backgrounds. For example, the rule of thirds, using shadows to add depth, and highlighting focal points within the background. [13] X Research source"

      "title": "Composite your animation.",
      "content": "Composite your animation. Use software like Adobe After Effects to bring everything you’ve made together—dialogue, keyframes, and backgrounds—and add lighting, shading, and other special effects. First, import the right background behind each scene’s frames. Then, use the software to shade characters and backgrounds for depth, light scenes uniquely depending on where they take place, and add special effects—such as the ooze of slime. [14] X Research source This is also the time to add music or sound effects in between or behind the dialogue. Do this in software like Adobe Audition, then transfer it to your compositing software."

      "title": "Edit your anime into a final cut.",
      "content": "Edit your anime into a final cut. Put all the scenes together in order in a program like Final Cut Pro. If you’re over your ideal runtime, see which scenes you may be able to trim or cut out. Watch your anime all the way through, taking notes on any last-minute changes you’d like to make when you edit . When you’re happy with your anime, export it from the software and save it to your computer as a video file. [15] X Research source Don’t forget to add a title card or sequence introducing the name of your anime film or series. Add credits at the end, mentioning everyone who helped you make the project."

      "content": "Send out your anime to competitions. Look for film and writing-related competitions or festivals that accept anime, as well as anime-specific competitions. If your work is accepted to a festival or wins a competition, it could be screened to a wider audience or distributed by a studio. Winning competitions also helps you land a job at a studio by giving you exposure and credibility. Canada’s GIRAF is a festival exclusively for independent animation. In America, there’s DCIFF , an independent film festival in DC that allows filmmakers to submit animation (including anime). Read all entry guidelines before submitting your work to a festival or competition. View past winners to get an idea of what the judges might be looking for."
