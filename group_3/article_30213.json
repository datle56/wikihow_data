      "title": "Check the portfolio requirements for submissions.",
      "content": "Check the portfolio requirements for submissions. Art schools, galleries, and other institutions set specific criteria for what they’re looking for in a portfolio. They may require certain sizes, mediums, or number of pieces, so read through the guidelines so you know what your portfolio must include. [1] X Research source Example: If you’re building an animation portfolio, you may be required to include drawings as well as videos of your completed animations. Example: If you’re making an architectural design portfolio, you may be required to include more sketches and design drawings."

      "title": "Pick finished compositions that show off your technical skills.",
      "content": "Pick finished compositions that show off your technical skills. Choose pieces that fill the page and have a clean appearance so you’re showing off your best work. Look for artwork that you’re really proud of that shows your understanding of skills like linework, shading, composition, and perspective. [2] X Research source Try to avoid pieces that have a blank background or have smudges because they can look unfinished or unprofessional. It can be a little tough to be unbiased about your own work, so ask your friends to choose some pieces they think are your best. If an organization or institution allows you to submit unfinished work, include a few sketches or process drawings for your finished work. These can help showcase your basic skills and how willing you are to experiment with different techniques to reach a finished piece."

      "title": "Choose art that captures your personal perspective.",
      "content": "Choose art that captures your personal perspective. People who view your portfolio want to see what unique ideas you bring to the table. As you’re going through your artwork, look for pieces that you feel a deep personal connection with. The pieces may reflect stories from your life or have traits that are unique to your style. [3] X Research source Heather Gallagher, a professional photographer, says “There should be a cohesive thread that runs through your work that makes it recognizable that it's yours.” If you’re building a photography portfolio, your style may be shooting only in natural light or black-and-white. [4] X Expert Source Heather Gallagher Professional Photojournalist & Photographer Expert Interview. 8 April 2020. Avoid including fan art or copies of another person’s art because they don’t show your own creativity and artistic talent. Stick to original ideas and designs that are uniquely yours."

      "title": "Showcase pieces with different subjects and mediums.",
      "content": "Showcase pieces with different subjects and mediums. Rather than keeping your subject matter limited, try to include a variety of pieces like portraits, still-lifes, and landscapes. Don’t be afraid to include drawings, paintings, sculptures, or photos in your portfolio to show off your diverse skillset. [5] X Research source Including pieces with different subjects or mediums shows your willingness and interest to try new things and explore as an artist."
    },
    {
      "title": "Include observational drawings.",
      "content": "Include observational drawings. Observational drawings are when you draw from a real-life subject instead of a picture. Drawing from observation shows how well you’re able to interpret shapes, forms, proportions, and perspective, so they make a great addition into your art portfolio. [6] X Research source Observational art also helps showcase how you interpret the world around you. Choose drawings that are expressive and capture the essence of the subjects without looking too rigid."

      "title": "Add pieces in art styles you’re interested in continuing.",
      "content": "Add pieces in art styles you’re interested in continuing. If there’s a specific medium, subject matter, or method that you want to keep pursuing, prioritize those pieces in your portfolio. That way, anyone going through your portfolio will see the areas you want to focus on as you further your artistic career. Just don’t forget to include other pieces that show your versatility as an artist. [7] X Research source Example: If you want to pursue graphic design, you may include logos or posters that you’ve created. Example: If you’re interested in fashion design, you may include drawings of clothing designs or pictures of clothing that you’ve made."

      "title": "Use a total of 12–20 pieces in your portfolio.",
      "content": "Use a total of 12–20 pieces in your portfolio. Try to put at least 12 pieces of art in your portfolio to show off your range of skills. Including more than 20 pieces can potentially be overwhelming and weaken your portfolio because it doesn’t seem like you’ve chosen your best pieces. Remember to check the requirements for portfolio submissions because they may specify a minimum or maximum number of pieces to include."
    },
    {
      "title": "Name and label your pieces.",
      "content": "Name and label your pieces. Come up with a name for each piece of artwork that you include in your portfolio so they’re easier to reference later on. Include the dimensions of the piece, the year you made it, and the medium you used so whoever views your portfolio knows what materials and sizes you’re comfortable working on. [8] X Research source Example: “Self Portrait”, 2024, 18 in x 24 in, Charcoal and graphite on paper Example: “Still-Life Study”, 2021, 10 in x 10 in, Digital Even if you can’t think of a name for a piece, it’s okay to name it something like “Untitled.”"

    {
      "title": "Write artist statements about each of your pieces.",
      "content": "Write artist statements about each of your pieces. Before you write an artist statement , think through the process and challenges you faced while creating the piece. Write a single paragraph explaining your inspiration and how a piece connects to your other work so anyone who looks through your portfolio understands your process better. [9] X Research source Try to take notes and write about your work while you’re creating it so it’s fresh in your mind. Always be sure to check for grammar mistakes before sharing your portfolio because errors could look unprofessional."

      "content": "Organize your pieces to show how you’ve grown as an artist. Start with your strongest work right away to show the level you’re at right now, and keep older pieces near the end of your portfolio. When you’re arranging the art in your portfolio, think about how the colors, mediums, compositions, and concepts flow together so they tell a cohesive story about your artistic journey."

      "title": "Ask friends and other artists to critique your portfolio.",
      "content": "Ask friends and other artists to critique your portfolio. After you’ve put together your portfolio, show it to other people and ask for their feedback. Try to find people who will give you their honest opinions, like a mentor or an art teacher. Ask them what pieces they think are the strongest and showcase your talent, and have them point out weaker pieces. [10] X Research source Some universities and artist organizations have National Portfolio Days where professional artists will critique and give feedback on your work.

      "content": "Take clear, high-resolution pictures of physical artwork. Set up your pieces in a well-lit area or use stand lights to light the space. Set your artwork on a flat surface or hang it on a plain wall. Use a digital camera to take your pictures so you can easily upload them to your computer. [12] X Research source If you have smaller drawings or paintings you want to share, try scanning them into your computer for the highest resolution. If you primarily make digital art, be sure to export your work in the highest available resolution so it looks clear and in focus."
