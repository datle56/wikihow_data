[1] X Research source If the Plex server is on the computer you're using right now, go to http://localhost:32400/web or http://127.0.0.1:32400/web . If the server is on the same local network, go to http://[Plex Server IP Address]:32400/web . For example, http://192.168.1.25:32400/web . If the server is on a different network, you'll need to use SSH to create a tunnel. If you're using Windows, use PuTTY . On a Mac, you can use a Terminal. Windows: Open PuTTY and type the IP address of your Plex server into the \"Host Name\" field. Then, go to Connection > SSH > Tunnels . For Source Port, type 8888 . For Destination, type localhost:32400 . Click Add , and then click Open to start the tunnel. Mac: In a Terminal , use this command to start the SSH tunnel to your Plex server, replacing \"ip.address\" with the IP address of the server: ssh ip.address -L 8888:localhost:32400 Both Windows and Mac: Once the tunnel is created, go to http://localhost:8888/web in your web browser.
