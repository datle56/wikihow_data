      "content": "Study the body’s meridians to understand the flow of energy. Acupressure is based on the idea that your body’s energy, known as chi, flows along certain pathways in the body, called meridians, and that stimulating pressure points along these meridians will balance your chi. There are 12 primary meridians running throughout the body — 6 in the arms, and 6 in the legs. Although there is no physiological proof that these meridians exist, they seem to follow the paths of nerves throughout the body. For example, the lung meridian, often referred to as L, connects the lungs and intestines to nerves in the wrist (acupressure point L7) and the back of the hand (acupressure point L14).
