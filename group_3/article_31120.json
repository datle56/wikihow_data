      "content": "Narrow down the troubleshooting steps. Is the problem with your mouse's hardware or your computer's software? Is the mouse acting funny due to settings, firmware, drivers, etc., or is the issue stemming from a broken spring, a bad USB port, or old batteries? You can usually figure this out through a process of elimination. Start by testing the mouse itself to see if there's an obvious physical issue."

      "content": "Use another USB port. Whether your mouse is wired or wireless, it probably has a USB cable or dongle; many Bluetooth-enabled mice use a USB dongle to connect to the computer. You want to move it to another port on your computer to see if the issue is your USB port, cable, or dongle. Avoid using a USB hub and plug it directly into your computer. If the port on your computer isn't good, then you'll notice that your mouse behavior has improved."

      "content": "Clean your mouse. Use a small tool like a toothpick to remove gunk and debris from small crevices . If your mouse has a trackball, remove it and clean each of the sensors gently. You can use a can of air or blow under the area that you click – there might be a wad of dust or a chip remnant stuck there that's preventing your mouse from clicking properly. Some users report this fix: Squeeze the buttons for about 10 seconds (really hard, though be careful not to break it). Shake the mouse. Blow the underside of the mouse (near the buttons) and shake it again. You may need to repeat this process a few times to get this temporary fix working. [1] X Research source If you have used the same mouse for a long time, the spring might have worn out; you'll need to repair it, but it's most likely easier to buy a new one."

To fix the mouse problem: Turn off your PC and unplug everything from it, including your USB mouse. (You can turn off your computer without using your mouse by pressing Ctrl + Alt + Del , pressing Tab to highlight the Power icon, and pressing Enter .) On a Mac, press and hold the \"Power\" button for more than 1.5 seconds. Turn on your computer. After the computer turns on, plug everything in."

There's a setting that changes a folder's behavior from double-clicking to single-clicking, which can make you think that your mouse is double-clicking when you click once. Here's what to do to change this setting: Open File Explorer (press Win + E ). If you're using Windows 10, click View > Options . If you're using Windows 11, click the three-dot menu icon and select Options . Make sure the setting is Double-click to open… under the \"Click items as follows\" header."

If the speed is set too high, your mouse might be registering excess clicks within a single click, mimicking the \"double-click when I single-click\" issue. Here's how to fix the click speed based on your operating system: Windows 10: - Go to Settings > Bluetooth & devices > Mouse > Additional mouse options . Drag the Double-click speed slider to the left, which is slower. If you move too close to Slow , however, Windows might consider two single-clicks to be a double-click, which introduces a new issue. Double-click the folder icon on the right to test out your click speed. Windows 11: - Go to Settings > Bluetooth > Mouse > Additional mouse settings . Mac: Go to System Settings > Mouse and adjust the slider next to \"Double-Click Speed.\""

      "content": "Update your mouse driver and firmware. All mice need updated drivers to function properly. However, not all mice come with a firmware suite that keeps you updated (like Logi Options+). Older mice with fewer features most likely don't have to worry about firmware updates, but users with fancy mice should check their mice's software or the manufacturer's website for those. Everyone, regardless of how fancy or not fancy your mouse is, must keep their drivers up-to-date . There are a few different ways that you can do this: Automatically for Windows and Mac: Most operating systems will automatically update drivers with a security update. For Windows, go to Settings > Update & Security (Win 10 only) > Windows Update > Check for updates . For Mac, go to System Settings > General > Software Update .
