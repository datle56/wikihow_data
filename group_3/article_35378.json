Your significant other may recognize symptoms or differences in your breasts that you did not see. They can help you perform a breast self-exam to detect further changes and provide much needed support while you get medical attention. [8] X Research source Be open and honest with your partner about your concerns and what symptoms you’ve detected. Ask your partner about any changes they have noticed.

      "content": "Press your breast tissue. A breast self-exam requires feeling your breast tissues in a thorough and methodical manner. Check each breast individually by using the opposite hand to the breast you want to examine. Work from the outside of your breast by your armpit and feel around the entire breast to ensure you’ve checked every surface of the tissue. [12] X Research source Lie down flat on your bed, the floor, or a table so that your breast tissue is evenly spread out across your chest. Lay your fingers flat on the breast you’re examining. Then firmly press the tissue in small, clockwise circles. Start at the outermost top edge of your breast and spiral the circles in towards your nipple. Use this technique for your entire breast and then repeat the process on the other side. Make sure you are checking your armpits as well. Feel for lumps and bumps during the exam and note where you find them. This can help your doctor more quickly locate them during any subsequent exams. In addition, make sure to closely look at your breast skin during the examination, which can help you identify any other changes such as puckering, dimpling, or scaly skin."

Tests including biopsies and imaging tests can better help your doctor diagnose breast cancer, determine the extent of the disease, and develop the best treatment plan for you. [15] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Allow your doctor to examine your breasts and perform a clinical breast exam. Like a self-exam, a clinical breast exam will include your doctor using their fingertips to feel for lumps or other changes in your breasts and surrounding tissues. The exam can also tell your doctor things such as the size of any lumps, the way they feel, and their proximity to your skin and muscles. Make sure to let the doctor know if you experience any pain during the exam. Get imaging tests including mammograms, ultrasounds, CT scans, and MRIs if your doctor prescribes them. These tests can help your doctor more closely look at tissue irregularities and determine the extent of any cancer you may have. Have a biopsy to remove lumps or suspect breast tissue. Biopsies, where a fine needle is inserted into the tissue to remove tissue for laboratory analysis, can also help determine if you have breast cancer and, if so, what type of cancer it is."

There are different treatment options for male breast cancer, all of which can successfully treat and cure the disease. Remember that early detection and diagnosis are key to treatment. [16] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Talk to your doctor about your treatment options and any concerns you may have. Ask questions about the diagnosis and nature of your breast cancer as well as the best ways to treat your specific case. Consider surgery such as a mastectomy to remove any tumors and surrounding tissue. In addition, you may require surgical removal of one lymph node to help determine if your breast cancer has spread. Undergo radiation therapy, which uses high-energy beams from sources like X-rays to eliminate breast cancer cells In many cases, radiation is combined with mastectomy to most effectively kill and remove breast cancer cells. Receive chemotherapy drugs by pill or intravenously to kill cancer cells. Chemotherapy can be used in conjunction with surgery and may be a good option for men with advanced cases of breast cancer. Consider hormone therapy if your breast cancer is hormone-sensitive. This usually includes taking the medication tamoxifen, which many people with female breast cancer also take. Be aware, though, that other hormone therapies used on female breast cancer patients do not work for males. Try targeted drug therapy, which attacks defects in cancer cells. Drugs such as Herceptin and Avastin may slow or even stop the growth of cancer cells; however, they can come with the side effect of heart damage. Ask your doctor about participating in a clinical trial for male breast cancer. This option may provide you with a new and different treatment method that can kill your breast cancer."
