      "content": "Call your local emergency number if you're in immediate danger. Threats are typically meant to scare or intimidate you, but if you think the person intends to follow through with their threats, don't hesitate to call the local emergency number. The operator will send law enforcement to your location as soon as possible for protection and support. [3] X Research source If someone has made a bomb threat or similar threat to your location, move to a safe place quickly. Make an effort to evacuate others if it seems possible to do so—for example, by pulling the fire alarm or notifying building security. Try to stay on the phone with the operator until the police arrive. They'll do what they can to comfort you and help you remain calm. Do what you can to assure your own safety as well as the safety of your loved ones—particularly if they've also been threatened. For example, if the person threatened to kill you and your family, you might need to make some phone calls to let your family members know about the threat. If you're in a situation where you can't talk to the operator, call the emergency number and leave the line open. Don't call and hang up, or they're going to call you right back, which could draw unwanted attention to you.

      "title": "Use the local police's non-emergency number if the threat isn't imminent.",
      "content": "Use the local police's non-emergency number if the threat isn't imminent. Even you don't feel like you're in immediate danger, you might still want to report the threat—perhaps to create a record in case something happens in the future or to alert police to the activity. The non-emergency number is typically posted on the website for your local police. If your area has an information service, such as 411, you could also call that number to get the non-emergency number. [5] X Expert Source Saul Jaeger, MS Police Captain, Mountain View Police Department Expert Interview. 21 February 2020. For example, if someone threatens you online, but you know they don't live near you or aren't capable of hurting you immediately, use the non-emergency number. Threats to property aren't typically considered emergencies either, unless it's something like a bomb threat that might involve catastrophic damage or loss of life. For example, if someone threatens to break your car windows and slash your tires, that's not considered an emergency. Some police departments might have several different non-emergency numbers. Just pick the one that best corresponds to your location and situation."

      "title": "Tell the officer who you are and where you're located.",
      "content": "Tell the officer who you are and where you're located. When a dispatch officer answers, give them your full legal name and address. If you're currently not at home, give them the address where you currently are as well as your home address. [6] X Research source The officer might ask you for additional information about yourself, such as your gender or age. Typically, this information is used for statistical purposes."

    {
      "title": "Provide the officer with detailed information about the threat.",
      "content": "Provide the officer with detailed information about the threat. Fill the officer in on who is threatening you, what they've threatened to do, when they threatened you, and where they threatened you. Provide as many details as possible but don't guess or assume anything—only tell the officer what you know to be true. [7] X Research source Tell the officer all the different ways in which the person threatened you. For example, if they threatened you on social media and called or texted you, tell the officer about all of these instances. If you know the person who is threatening you, tell the officer about your current or previous relationship with the person. For example, you might've dated the person in the past or they might be a member of your family."

      "title": "Follow up with an officer in person if necessary.",
      "content": "Follow up with an officer in person if necessary. Often, an officer will visit your location to review any evidence you have and confirm your identity. The officer might also ask you questions to confirm the information you provided over the phone. [8] X Research source Typically, you'll have to sign the notes drafted by the officer. Read them over carefully to make sure they're accurate and let the officer know if anything's incorrect. If your report is assigned to a detective for investigation, that detective will likely reach out to you as well."

Typically, you'll have to make a visit down to the police station in person to pick it up. If you're not able to do that, call and ask if they can mail you one. [9] X Research source Save your police report for your records. If a detective was assigned to your case, get their name and contact information so you can call them directly if the person threatens you again."

      "title": "Find the nearest local police station.",
      "content": "Find the nearest local police station. Go to the local law enforcement website for a list of police stations. You can also use the GPS app on your phone to find a police station and get directions from your current location. Generally, you should report the threats where they occur. However, this applies to the city as a whole—not individual precincts. So, for example, if you live in Los Angeles, you can generally use the most convenient police station, even if you received the threats on the other side of town."

      "content": "Visit the police station during normal business hours. While police stations are typically staffed 24/7, you'll have better luck filing a police report if you go during the day. Try to go first thing in the morning when there's usually a shorter wait. Bring a valid photo ID so the police can verify your identity. [10] X Research source In many cities, you also have the option of having an officer dispatched to your location to take the report. If you use this option, you might be waiting for a while before the officer arrives, particularly on busy days. [11] X Research source"

If you have a prior relationship with the person who threatened you, let the officer know this as well. [12] X Research source The officer might ask you questions to learn more information about the situation. Answer all questions as completely and truthfully as you can, even if they don't seem relevant to you. The more information you can give the more the police will have to go on. At the same time, if you don't know something, just say so—don't guess, assume, or make something up. If you have screencaps, text messages, phone records, emails, or other evidence of the threats, offer those to the officer. They might take your originals or make copies of them."

For example, if the person threatens you again, call the police non-emergency number and tell them you have additional information to add to a report you filed. Give them the report number and they'll update the report. When you get your copy of the report, ask if a detective has been assigned to your case.

However, different departments have their own rules regarding the types of crime you can report online."

If you have space, include any background information that you think might be helpful to police. [15] X Research source For example, if you're receiving online threats, you might not have a lot of information about the identity of the person threatening you. But police will find their screen name, photos, names of friends, and any other identifying information useful. Some online report forms allow you to attach digital files. If you have screencaps or copies of emails or other communication from the person who threatened you, attach those. If there's no option to attach files, simply include a line letting police know you have that evidence available. The police department typically issues a temporary report number for you to use until the final report is created. Use that number if you need to change or update anything in your report."
