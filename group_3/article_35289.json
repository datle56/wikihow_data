      "content": "Learn the divisions of the Haab calendar. [2] X Research source The Haab calendar is one Maya method of counting time. It is roughly based on the solar cycle, and so it is relatively recognizable to users of the Gregorian calendar. “Haab” itself translates as “year.” Each haab has 18 months (uinals) of 20 days. This makes a Haab of 360 days, or one tun. In addition, each haab has one month of 5 days (Wayeb). Together, this makes 365, which approximates the solar year (365 ¼ days). A tun is also called a vague year, since it only approximates the solar year—it does not include the ¼ day or a leap day every four years, like the Gregorian calendar does."

Each day for each cycle has an attached number running 1-13. This makes for a total year length of 260 days. Scholars do not know why the cycle is 260 days. Some believe this length is related to agricultural cycles, others to the movement of heavenly bodies (such as the planet Venus), and others to the human gestational period."

The complete calendar round contains 52 repetitions of 365 days (18,980 days). This creates combination dates such as 4 Ajaw 3 Kankin and 7 Manik 10 Kankin."

The specific name of this calendar is not known, so archaeologists refer it to simply as the “Long Calendar.” This calendar has a cycle totaling 5125 1/3 years. The Long Calendar represents five cycles of time, similar to how the Gregorian calendar represents days, months, years, centuries, and millennia. The five cycles are: Kin, or days Uinal (each uinal is equivalent to 20 kin/days) Tun (each tun is equivalent to 18 uinal, or 360 days) Katun (each katun is equivalent to 20 tun or 7200 days) Baktun (each baktun is equivalent to 20 katun, or 144,000 days)"

Each number (separated by a dot) in the expression 13.0.0.0.0 represents a position within the five cycles of the Long Calendar, in the order baktun, katun, tun, uinal, kin.

The date (29, in this example), signifies a particular position within the unit of one month, which may be 28, 29, 30, or 31 days in length.

The elements of this date are: Manik signifies the day within a named cycle of 20 days used in the Tzolkin calendar. The 7 following signifies the date's position within a cycle of 13 days used in the Tzolkin calendar. Kankin provides the name of one in a cycle of 18 months used in the Haab calendar. 10 gives the date's position within a cycle of 20 days forming one uinal, or month. 12.19.15.17.7 provides the number of years since a fixed reference point, the start of a Maya cycle: 12 baktun, 19 katun, 15 tun, 15 uinal, 7 kin."
