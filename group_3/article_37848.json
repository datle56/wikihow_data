      "content": "Goals motivate you and give you a tangible number to reach for. You can set a goal that involves running a certain distance in a specific length of time—for example, your goal could be to run 1 mile in 8 minutes. Alternatively, you could set yourself a goal that involves increasing the number of steps you take in a minute or your cadence. The fastest runners in the world have an average cadence of around 180 steps per minute. [1] X Research source It is important to have a specific goal in mind as you are training to run faster. [2] X Expert Source Francisco Gomez Fitness Coach Expert Interview. 24 October 2030. Having a goal will increase your motivation and force you to push yourself that little bit harder in order to attain it. To find your current cadence, run for 60 seconds, counting the number of times your right foot hits the ground. Then, double this number to find your existing cadence."

      "content": "Practice running quickly to get your heart rate up. Even if you’re not a sprinter, running sprints is a great way to increase your speed and focus on your form. Do sprints by warming up with a quick jog, then sprinting for about 30 seconds. Rest and recover for 2 to 5 minutes, then sprint again. [3] X Research source Try to sprint about 4 times in a row before taking a long rest."

      "content": "Vary your running pace randomly to increase your stamina. \"Fartlek\" is a Swedish word meaning \"speed play.\" To do fartlek training, head out on a 40- to 60-minute run, then pick a spot to start sprinting. Sprint as fast as you can for as long as you can (usually only 1 to 3 minutes), then slow back down to your normal pace. [4] X Research source Fartleks are a very flexible training method, and you can decide what the ratio of jogging to sprinting will be, depending on how you're feeling on a given day. Most runners don't use very exact methods or timing for doing fartlek training. A lot of times, runners will simply decide to sprint until they get to a particular landmark, like a telephone pole or fire hydrant. The length of the sprint is entirely up to you and your body's ability."

      "content": "Keep your heart rate up during a run to improve your running speed. To figure out your ideal “tempo,” or running speed, use a running pace calculator . Plug in your information, like a running distance and how long it takes you to run that distance, then mark down the pace that you can comfortably run for 30 minutes. Do a tempo run by heading out and running at your maximum pace for at least 30 minutes to keep your heart rate up the entire time. [5] X Research source Your tempo pace may be faster than you’re used to maintaining. If you need to slow down, that’s totally fine. Many runners like tempo runs because they’re so customizable to each person."

      "content": "Use hills to gradually build speed over time. Either find a hill outdoors somewhere or use a treadmill with an incline setting. Run up and down the same hill going as fast as you can for as long as you can. Over time, your endurance and your stamina will increase, leading to faster run times. Hill runs are actually better for your body too, as they help you to achieve high intensities while limiting the joint shock caused by pounding on flat surfaces. To really get the intensity level up, you can try doing some hill sprints. This involves running up a fairly steep hill for 30 to 60 seconds, at the maximum speed that you can physically maintain for that length of time."

While it’s tempting to only focus on your leg strength when improving your running speed, your core muscles hold up your torso and keep the proper posture. Be sure to incorporate core workouts, like crunches , sit-ups , and planks into your exercise routine. Work your core at least 2 to 3 times per week to strengthen it over time."
