If you are missing an item of clothing, visit your local thrift store. The clothing is often separated by color and the prices are cheap. [1] X Research source Wear one of the items you already have when you go shopping. This ways you can match the colors at the store. Look for hoodies to give you that green cover on your head. Consider wearing tights and a leotard. If you choose to do this, match the leotard to your shell color. Look for green mittens to cover your hands. You can also use green body paint for your hands if you can’t find green mittens."

Face paint can be found at a costume shop or hobby shop. If Halloween is coming up, you may also be able to find it available in the seasonal section of your local pharmacy."

      "content": "Get the items you will need to make the Shell of your choice. Decide which method you will use to create your shell and make sure you get everything you will need. If you are making a shell out of a roasting pan, get a disposable aluminum roasting pan. These can be found in grocery stores and Dollar Stores/Pound Shops etc in the baking section. Look for a pan with an oval shape which has a pattern stamped into the bottom for catching grease, which looks similar to the pattern on a shell. These are usually used for roasting large birds like turkeys. [2] X Research source Choose your paint. You will want some dark brown and dark green spray paint. If you choose to make some color accents on your shell, you can also pick up some water-based acrylics and big paint brushes at your local hobby shop. [3] X Research source Purchase some painters tape. This is available at a hobby shop or hardware store. You want to get some which is thin and will fit in the molded lines of the pan, about 3/4 inch wide. [4] X Research source Pick up some wide brown ribbon. You may be able to find this in the stationery section of your local Target or Walmart. You can also get ribbon at a hobby shop or fabric store. This is going to be used to strap the shell to your back. Opt for a ribbon which is strong and will be comfortable on your shoulders. If you choose to make your shell out of felt, you will need some dark green and light green felt along with a few other items. Make sure you purchase enough dark green felt to create an oval which will cover your back, as well as another oval 3 inches (7.6 cm) larger than the first. You will need half as much light green felt. Get a glue gun and glue sticks. This method requires a sewing machine and you will want to get dark green thread if you don’t already have some. Purchase a large bag of stuffing. Thicker stuffing used for stuffed animals is a better choice then a softer pillow stuffing. Find one or two large pieces of cardboard. You will need a surface large enough to create an oval large enough to cover your back. You may want two ovals of the same size to reinforce the base of your shell. Pick up some wide dark green ribbon to match your dark green felt. You may be able to find this in the stationary section of your local Target or Walmart. You can also get ribbon at a hobby shop or fabric store. This is going to be used to strap the shell to your back. Opt for a ribbon which is strong and will be comfortable on your shoulders."

      "content": "Mold the roasting pan to look more like a turtle shell. The pan is already pretty close to looking like a turtle shell, which is really convenient. It is also easily malleable if you would like to make any adjustments. If the lip on the pan is really large, fold it over into the inside of the pan to reduce the squared corners. Avoid cutting this section, which could leave sharp edges. Push out from the inside of the pan to round out the bends in the roasting pan until the sides look more rounded like a turtle shell."

      "content": "Poke four holes in the pan. This is where the ribbon will be threaded to hold the pan on your back, so think about where the straps of a backpack would go. Put two holes in the top corners of the pan and two in the bottom. It is helpful to put the top holes and little wider apart and the bottom holes a little closer together by about one inch. This has the effect of cinching the straps near your waist. The holes should be about the size of the width of a pen or pencil. Use a drill to make these holes if you have one. The pan can also be punctured with other sharp tools like scissors or a screwdriver."

Allowing some of the brown to show through the green paint will give the shell a nice textured look. For even more texture, use a large paint brush and green acrylic paint to dry brush on the green color. Squeeze the paint onto a palette and apply a small amount of paint to the brush without using any water. Lightly brush the green over the brown spray paint using cross strokes."

You will want to push them from the inside out again. Don’t tie knots yet. In order to get the straps the correct length, it is best to have a friend hold the shell in place on your back before you tie knots in the bottom of the ribbons.

The top and bottom lines should be longer than the other lines creating the triangular points on the sides. Cut two of these hexagons in half. Make enough small squares to cover the entire edge of the shell, leaving space between each tile to let the dark green felt show through the space between the squares. Cut 6 of the four-sided shapes which will cover the top and the bottom of the shell. These shapes will create the scales filling the top and the bottom of the shell between the hexagonal scales.
