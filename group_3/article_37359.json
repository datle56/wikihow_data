      "content": "Respond to in-person condolences with a genuine “thank you.” People understand that you’ll be emotional or in pain. When they say “I’m sorry for your loss,” they just want you to know that they support you, and won’t be expecting a longer conversation. A simple “thank you” works. Other short phrases you can say are, “I appreciate it,” or “That’s very kind.” If the other person knew the deceased and is grieving too, you can acknowledge that by also responding , “This must be hard for you, too.”"
