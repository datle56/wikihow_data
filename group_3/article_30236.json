      "title": "Gather your materials.",
      "content": "Gather your materials. To create a simple electromagnetic pulse, you will need a disposable camera, copper wire, rubber gloves, solder and soldering tools, and an iron rod. These components can be found at your local hardware store. The thicker gauge copper wire you use in this experiment, the more powerful your electromagnetic pulse will be. In the event an iron rod is not available to you, you can use a non-metal rod as a substitute. However, a non-metal rod will have a negative impact on the strength of your EMP. When working with electrical components that could be holding a charge, or when running an electrical current through an object, it is recommended you wear rubber gloves to prevent any errant shocks to yourself."

      "content": "Create an electromagnetic coil. An electromagnetic coil is a device that is made up of two distinct yet integral parts: a conductor and a core. [3] X Research source In this case, your iron rod will be your core and your copper wire the conductor."

      "title": "Solder the ends of your electromagnetic coil to a capacitor.",
      "content": "Solder the ends of your electromagnetic coil to a capacitor. A capacitor is generally a double-pronged, cylindrical shaped component found on most circuit boards. Your disposable camera should have a capacitor for its flash. [5] X Research source Be sure that the battery of your disposable camera is removed before attempting to solder the ends of your coil to the capacitor, or else you could get a nasty shock. Wearing rubber gloves can save you from getting an electric jolt while handling your camera circuit and flash capacitor. Expend the charge in your capacitor by engaging the flash after removing the batteries from your camera. Any stored charge in your camera can result in an electrical shock. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Find a safe place to test your EMP device.",
      "content": "Find a safe place to test your EMP device. Depending on the materials you have used, the effective range of your EMP shouldn't be more than a few feet in any direction. Be that as it may, any electronics caught in your EMP may be permanently destroyed . Keep in mind that EMP's indiscriminately influence electronics. This includes life-supporting devices, like pacemakers, and valuables like cellular phones. Any damage you cause to these devices through your EMP could result in legal repercussions. A grounded platform, like a tree stump or plastic table, is an ideal testing surface for your EMP emitter."

      "title": "Find a suitable test object.",
      "content": "Find a suitable test object. Since the electromagnetic pulse field will only affect electronics, you may want to buy an inexpensive electronic device from your local electronics store. If your electronic device ceases to function after your EMP, you have successfully created an electromagnetic pulse. Many office supply stores have affordable electronic calculators that you can use to test your EMP."

    {
      "title": "Reinstall your camera battery.",
      "content": "Reinstall your camera battery. You will need electricity to re-charge your capacitor, which will then provide the current to your electromagnetic coil and create your EMP. Be sure you have placed your test object close to your EMP emitter."
    },
    {
      "title": "Allow your flash capacitor to charge.",
      "content": "Allow your flash capacitor to charge. You can do this by removing the wires from the electromagnetic coil, allowing the current from the battery to feed into the capacitor, and then with a insulated manipulator (like rubber gloves or plastic tongs), reattach the wires of your coil to your capacitor. Using your bare hands could result in a taser-like zap."

    {
      "title": "Activate your flash capacitor.",
      "content": "Activate your flash capacitor. By activating the flash of your camera, you will release the stored electricity in it, which will surge through your electromagnetic coil and create your EMP. The nature of the EMP field you are creating will affect any electronics, even those that are switched off. If you have chosen a calculator as your test object, after activating your capacitor, if your EMP has worked, the calculator will not turn on. Depending on the kind of flash capacitor you have used, the voltage required to charge your capacitor will be variable. The approximate capacitance for a disposable camera should be between 80-160 microfarads, and the voltage will likely be between 180-330 volts.

Remove the batteries first, and then remove the circuit board, taking note of the position of the flash capacitor. Wearing rubber gloves can save you from getting an electric jolt while handling your camera circuit and flash capacitor. Capacitors generally look like cylinders attached to the circuit board with two prongs. This will be a necessary component for you EMP device. Expend the charge in your capacitor by engaging the flash after removing the batteries from your camera. Any stored charge in your camera can result in an electrical shock."

Use your electrical tape, taking care not to cover any of the electric pathways of your camera circuit, and attach it to your piece of cardboard. You'll want to attach your camera circuit face up so that the capacitor and its connection pathways aren't interfered with by the cardboard. Your cardboard mount for your camera circuit should have some additional space for your AA holder."

      "content": "Attach your electromagnetic coil to the end of your walkie-talkie antenna. Since current will be running through your coil to create your EMP, it's a good idea to double insulate your antenna by putting another small piece of cardboard between your coil and the antenna. You can then use your electrical tape to attach your coil to the cardboard."

The excess wire that you left at the beginning and end of your copper wire winding will need to be soldered to the electrodes of your flash capacitor.

Grasping your EMP device by the insulated base of the antenna, like a Ghostbuster Neutron Wand, hold your electromagnetic coil toward your test object and flick your switch to the \"On\" position. If you are not confident in your knowledge or construction of electrical components, you may want to wear a pair of rubber gloves when operating your device, as an added precaution. If your device has successfully worked, your test object, and any other electronics caught in your EMP field, will not turn on. Depending on the kind of flash capacitor you have used, the voltage required to charge your capacitor will be variable.
