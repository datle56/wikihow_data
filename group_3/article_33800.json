      "content": "Know a bit about the martingale strategy. Probably the most common roulette strategy out there, the martingale relies on doubling bets after a loss in a ~50/~50 chance game. This way, the first win recoups all the previous losses, along with a small profit for the gambler. The advantage of this strategy is intuitive. In basic roulette, you're playing a coin-flip game. You bet on a color, and your color either wins out or it doesn't. If you only bet on a single color, and you keep doubling your bet until you win. Provided you keep doubling losing bets, as soon as you win, you've recovered all your losses. The are a couple disadvantages to this strategy. First, keep in mind what is called the gambler's fallacy. Just because black has won 10, or even 100, times in a row does not mean that red is any more likely the next time around. The chance is 50% each spin. Actually, it is slightly less than 50/50 with the 0 and 00. Another disadvantage of this strategy is that, eventually, you may reach the maximum bet, or run out of money, after several consecutive losses. As soon as this happens, you're in the red, even if you win. You need to continue making larger bets — or winning out — in order to recoup your losses."

Leonardo Pisano Bigollo, also known as Fibonacci, was a famous Italian mathematician who discovered an interesting sequence of numbers which are now named after him.

[6] X Research source The Fibonacci strategy involves betting by adding the last two bets together. One advantage of this is that you can come out with a profit by losing more games than you've won. But one serious disadvantage is that the further you go down the sequence, the more money you lose. In other words, strike quit or get out of the way."
