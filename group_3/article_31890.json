Remove small bills from your wallet every few days (e.g. aim to keep two twenty dollar bills in your wallet at all times and remove five and ten dollar bills regularly.) As an exception, keep extra cash in your wallet that you anticipate spending in the near future (e.g. money to use at a yard sale)."
