      "content": "Dilute the stain with water. If you just spilled soda in your car, act immediately by diluting the stain. Pour cool water over the entire stain, wetting but not drenching the stain. Then blot it with a clean cloth. [1] X Research source Adding water keeps the stain at the surface of the upholstery and prevents it from setting. Blot the stain as opposed to rubbing it. Blotting encourages the stain to lift, whereas rubbing can force the stain deeper into the upholstery. If the stain is old, still add water to the stain and blot briefly before turning to other methods. Just blotting alone won't eliminate an old stain, but it is still a good way of loosening the stain so that you can tackle it with other, more powerful methods. Use a light-colored microfiber cloth so you can see how much of the stain is lifting up and transferring to the cloth.

Use gentle brushing motions to apply it to the entire stained area. Leave the paste on the stain for a half an hour. A toothbrush is a great tool to use because its bristles help to work the baking soda paste into the fabric. Leaving it to sit for a half an hour also helps the baking soda to penetrate the upholstery."

Spot test an area of your leather or vinyl seat beforehand, then dip a clean cloth into the isopropyl alcohol, squeeze out the excess, then blot at the stain with the dampened cloth. [8] X Research source It’s important to do a spot test beforehand, as isopropyl alcohol can discolor the dye in leather or vinyl seats. To spot test, dampen a cloth with isopropyl alcohol and dab gently at an inconspicuous area of the seat. If you don’t notice any discoloration after about ten seconds of dabbing, it’s safe to use on the stain. Don’t pour the isopropyl alcohol directly on the stain. Instead, dampen a cloth with the alcohol and dab. Pouring the alcohol onto the leather or vinyl can discolor it or cause the dye to rub away."
