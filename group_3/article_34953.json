      "content": "Get mentally ready. Do you love the taste of your caffeinated drink and the jolt of energy it can give you? Most people drink caffeine for one or both of those reasons, but too much caffeine can do serious damage to your system. If you’re constantly sipping on your caffeinated drink of choice, it’s probably time to slow down and help your body return to a more normal state. Up to 400 mg a day is okay, but any more is too much. FYI, 400 mg of caffeine is equal to the amount in 4 or 5 cups of coffee.

      "content": "Choose a replacement beverage. If caffeinated drinks are an essential part of your day, you might need a replacement. Drink more water—it is the healthiest and best choice. Switch things up with green tea, fruit-infused water, or sparkling water, but steer clear of sodas, many of which are caffeinated.

      "content": "Make it hard to drink caffeine. Allocate your caffeine money at the beginning of the week, so that if you over-consume it at the beginning of the week, you will have nothing to fall back onto at the end of the week. If you allocate less and less caffeine money as you go on, you will gradually reduce your intake."

Thus, consuming caffeine in any form will make you break your promise, and this will provide you with another incentive to stay on the wagon. Even just telling a friend that you are trying to cut out caffeine can help to provide you with some support. Try sending a daily text or calling a friend daily to update them on your progress."

      "content": "Find positive distractions. As your body is withdrawing from caffeine, come up with ways to keep your mind off it. Think in advance when your weakest moments are likely to be (i.e. in the morning, when you're driving by your favorite cafe, etc.) and turn to a comfort item to get you through these times. This can be anything that comforts you and helps you take your mind off of caffeine. It could be a stuffed toy, a pocket video game, calling your best friend, or doing a crossword puzzle. You can have as many security blankets as you need, just make sure you always have one close at hand."

      "content": "Use natural lighting. Your body responds naturally to changes in light, so if it's unnaturally dark where you're working or sleeping it may make staying alert a lot harder. Conversely, if you keep on too many lights, your body won’t be able to tell when it’s truly tired—and you will need more rest while you’re quitting caffeine. Try keeping your blinds or window coverings open so that natural light can signal to you when it’s time to wake and sleep. Plus, natural light can increase alertness, mood, and productivity!
