      "content": "Glue your trophy tops to a plank of wood to make your own coat rack. To separate your trophy topper from the body of the trophy, simply unscrew the nut at the very bottom, and twist the topper in a counter-clockwise direction until it comes off. Then, position a 41.5 in × 4.5 in (105 cm × 11 cm) piece of plywood on its side so you can easily access both the front and the back sides. Hold a topper on the front side of the board about 2–4 in (5.1–10.2 cm) from the edge, and drill the topper into the wood from the backside. Continue adding your toppers to your wood every 2–4 in (5.1–10.2 cm). If you’d like, you can apply a wood stain or glaze over top to finish your coat rack. Use 5-6 trophy toppers, depending on how spread out you want the hooks to be."

      "content": "Turn your trophies into a decorative cupcake stand. Unscrew the nut at the bottom of your trophy, and disassemble the pieces. Turn your topper counter-clockwise to take the top off, then separate the middle column as well. Apply a light, even layer of all-purpose spray paint to your column, base, and topper if you'd like to change the color. You can also spray paint your cake trays so they match. Drill a hole through the center of 2 cake trays, and reassemble your trophy. As you do this, place 1 cake tray in between the main column and the base piece, and place the other cake tray in between the column and the topper. If you want to use doilies, add them as you are stacking your pieces, or cut a slit from the center hole and place them onto your cake trays. If you are applying spray paint, wait 30-60 minutes for the pieces to dry before you assemble them. Once you assemble your trophies, you can easily stack cupcakes, cookies, or other desserts on your stands!"
