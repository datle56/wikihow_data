      "content": "Ease awkwardness with small talk. It can be very awkward when you find yourself in a social situation with your ex and neither or you know quite how to approach it, or react to each other. Avoid any long silences by making neutral small talk about everyday things that are nothing to do with your relationship. If you can get used to just talking about normal things you can try to develop a platonic friendship. Keeping conversation friendly but brief can help ease you both into the new relationship dynamic. You could say, \"Hey, did you see the game last night?\" You could ask about mutual friends or work."

      "content": "Do social activities with mutual friends. One way to show that you are not avoiding your ex, you are still keen to be friends, and still care about him is to do social activities as part of a larger group of friends.
