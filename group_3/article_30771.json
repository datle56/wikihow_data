      "content": "Frequent upscale bars and hotels. Upscale bars are often full of rich men and women. Millionaires, and rich singles in general, tend to do a lot of traveling, so what better place to meet them than in the lounge of a fancy hotel. The good news is that many hotels let anyone buy a drink at the lounge, so you don’t actually have to be spending gazillions on a hotel room while you're looking for dates. Dress in fairly formal clothing when visiting these places. You're more likely to run into wealthy people if you go to the places where someone at that level would be at.

Understand what matters to you financially so that you can seek out people who have lifestyles that align with your goals."

      "content": "Set up a meeting to ask for mentorship. When meeting a potential mentor, its important to get to them and see if you are a good fit. Then, make sure you clearly ask for mentorship, because it is respectful of the other person’s time, and gives them the opportunity to say no.
