Both medicines are safe in small doses, and they both have a low risk of side effects when you take them as directed, so the choice of which one to take really comes down to what you normally prefer to have on hand, unless your doctor specifically advises you to take one over the other. Dosing is as follows: [3] X Research source Talk to your doctor for dosage instructions for children under 13.

A fever is often your body's way of fighting off an infection, so having chills may be a sign that your immune system is working overtime. If your doctor determines that you have a bacterial infection, they'll prescribe you a course of antibiotics. [11] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Even if you start to feel better, take all of the antibiotics that are prescribed to you in order to ensure the infection is completely gone. Otherwise, it may return, and it will likely be more difficult to treat a second time. For instance, chills are often a symptom of a urinary tract infection (UTI). Chills are also a common symptom of malaria, so let your doctor know if you've traveled to any area where the disease is common. However, it's unlikely that you've contracted malaria if you live in the U.S. A viral infection, such as a flu or the common cold, can also cause a fever and chills. However, antibiotics won’t work to treat viral infections. Don’t take antibiotics unless your doctor prescribes them."
