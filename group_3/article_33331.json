      "content": "Learn the 10 basic 5-card hands and their ranking . No matter what type of poker you play, the hands will always be the same. To start familiarizing yourself with the different hands, print out a \"cheat sheet\" and study it. Then, memorize the different hands so you can easily recognize them. Here are the winning poker hands, from highest to lowest: The highest-ranking hand is a royal flush (the royal straight flush). This hand includes a 10, Jack, Queen, King, and Ace of the same suit, one kind (all clubs, diamonds, hearts or spades). It can only be tied but not beaten by the royal flush of another suit. A straight flush is made up of 5 consecutive cards of the same suit. 4 of a kind means you have 4 cards of the same rank (but different suits, of course) and a fifth card of any rank (such as 4 aces and a 9). If you have 4 aces, then no one can have any hand with an ace, so no royal flush is available. A full house contains 3 matching cards of 1 rank and 2 matching cards of another rank. A flush contains any 5 cards of the same suit. These skip around in rank or sequence, but are from the same suit. A straight contains 5 cards of consecutive rank but from more than one suit. 3 of a kind means you have 3 cards of the same rank, plus two unmatched cards. 2 pair is made up of two cards of one rank, plus two cards of another rank (different from the first pair), plus one unmatched card. Pair means you have 2 cards of the same rank, plus 3 other unmatched cards. High card is the lowest-ranking (called a \"nothing\") hand, when no two cards have the same rank, the five cards are not consecutive, and they are not all from the same suit."

      "content": "Place the blinds (starting bets) or \"ante up. \" In poker, bets are placed at the beginning of the game in one of 2 ways. In Texas Hold’em, the player next to the dealer typically places a small blind bet that’s half of the usual minimum bet, while the player to that person’s left places a big blind that’s at least the minimum bet. As another option, each player can “ante up” the minimum starting bet, which means placing a minimum starting bet into the pool. [1] X Research source Aside from Texas Hold’em, most poker variants use an “ante up” system."

Then, they'll pass out 2 cards to each player. Check your cards to see what you're holding. [2] X Research source In poker, the dealer will burn a card every round of dealing. That way, it’s harder for players to anticipate what card is coming up and the game becomes more of a gamble. The dealer will always pass out the cards in a clockwise direction, starting on the left."

Every time the dealer puts out new cards, you'll make a bet, with the first bet being made solely based on the two cards the players have in their hands. Betting happens in a circle – when it's your turn to bet, you have a few options. At this point you can: [3] X Research source Place an initial bet if no one else has yet. Say \"check\" to avoid betting. Say \"call\" to match the bet someone else has made. Say \"raise\" to add more money to the betting pool. If you \"raise,\" the other players will go around in a circle and choose to either \"call\" your new bet or fold. Say \"fold\" if someone else has bet and you don't want to match their bet.

Then, they'll put 3 cards face-up on the table, which is called the \"flop.\" These are the community cards that every player can use to build their hand. Compare these cards and the cards in your hand, then place a bet, call a bet, or fold. [4] X Research source In total, the dealer will reveal 5 cards. You will have 7 cards total to use to create your best hand of 5: your two personal cards in your hands, and the five community cards on the table. While your luck can turn later on in a game, take some time to analyze the table after the \"flop\" – are you well-positioned to end the game with a good hand? Depending on the rules where you’re playing, you can also draw replacement cards for the cards in your hand. This is usually done during or just after the betting round."

[5] X Research source Your game may also allow a card exchange at this point, but this isn’t typical in professional games . As you look at the cards, think about the possible hands other players might have. For instance, if all 4 cards on the table are spades, then any player who has a spade in their hand will have a flush, which means they have 5 cards from the same house. Similarly, if the cards on the table are 5,6,7, and 8, then anyone with a 4 or 9 will have a straight. If you have nothing good in your hand but the cards on the table make for an easy winning hand, then you may want to fold, as it’s likely another player has a winning card."

If you fold your hand, then you don’t have to show your cards. In Texas Hold’em, there are 5 cards on the table and 2 cards in your hand. You can create any 5-card combination using these 7 cards. The remaining cards aren’t counted. If you want to play the cards on the table only, this is called “playing the board.” However, it’s an option that everyone has, so it may not be the best strategy."

You should almost always raise when your hand is a pair, face cards, or aces. An ace and a king or an ace and a queen are strong hands as well. If you have these hands, bet before the flop to raise the value of the pot. If the card you need doesn’t turn up, you can either bluff or fold.

The general rule of thumb is you should be able to easily afford to lose 200 bets at the highest limit. So if the limit is $5 bets, then your bankroll should be $1000, and stop there. Track your wins and losses if you start getting more serious about poker. This will help you figure out whether you are winning or losing in the long run.

This is a more advanced aspect of the game, but it’s always good to be aware of players’ tells—especially your own. Watch for betting patterns such as betting early, very often (probably with weak hands), or late in a hand (as intimidation). Physical tells can also give you an estimation of your opponent’s strength of hand and help you keep your own strategy secret by avoiding such patterns. [13] X Research source Some classic tells include shallow breathing, sighing, nostrils flaring, flushing red, eyes watering, blinking, swallowing excessively, or an increasing pulse seen in the neck or temple. A hand over the mouth is usually to conceal a smile, while shaking hands usually reveal nerves. If a player glances at their chips when the flop comes, they probably have a strong hand. If a mediocre player tries to impress you by staring you down, they are likely bluffing."

You can tell if players are more conservative by noticing those folding early—evidently only staying in a hand when their cards are good. Very conservative players won’t lose as much money, but they're easily spotted by more experienced players. Because they tend to avoid high betting, they can often be bluffed into folding. Aggressive players are risk-takers that often bet high early in a hand before seeing how the other players are acting on their cards."

Since every poker game is different, it’s important to develop good instincts rather than try to memorize and apply tricky systems. Observe experienced players and imagine how you’d react in their position. Then, watch how the experienced players react to build your own instincts. While you do this, consider how successful you’d have been if you were playing and reacted as you did. Would you have won, or would you have lost?

Next, hold a stack in each hand close together and facing each other. Use your thumbs to flip through the cards, combining the deck into one. After the cards are shuffled, get someone who isn’t the dealer to cut the deck by separating it into 2 stacks and placing the bottom stack on top. [14] X Research source Do several shuffles to make sure the cards are mixed up. You can cut the deck more than once if you’d like. The dealer typically does the shuffling and bets last, which is called the “button” position. After each hand, you’ll pass the dealer/button position to the next player on the left. If the dealer is always the same person, like in a casino, the button position will still pass clockwise around the table."

If you say \"check\" when it's your turn at the beginning of a new hand, that means you are choosing not to place a bet at that point. Instead, you pass the chance to open to the next player. In the following rounds, if you say “check,” that means you’re staying with the bets you already paid into the pot during this hand, and you won’t pay more until someone else raises during their turn. If another player does raise on that hand, then you nor anyone else can say \"check\" or maintain your “check”—so when the play comes around to you again you have to either match or raise the latest bet or fold your hand."

If everyone checks, then it is time to choose to discard and draw 1 to 3 cards, or \"hold pat\" on the cards you have. When there are fewer than 3 cards available to draw, replacements will be drawn.
