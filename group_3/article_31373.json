      "content": "Your life purpose is creating a happy home full of meaningful connections. Having a north node in Cancer means learning to embrace Cancer’s traits. Cancer, as a cardinal water sign ruling the 4th house of family, is known for domesticity and an impeccable ability to create loving bonds with other people. With a Cancer north node, your life goal is to learn to feel your deep well of emotions and open up your heart. [1] X Research source While having a north node in Cancer makes you warm and intuitive, like the crab that represents this cardinal water sign, you may struggle to come out of your shell. Famous people with their north nodes in Cancer include Marilyn Monroe, Bob Marley, and Michelle Obama. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "You have a south node in Capricorn.",
      "content": "You have a south node in Capricorn. Every north node has a polar opposite south node, and on the opposite of Cancer’s axis sits Capricorn . Your south node represents the traits you mastered in a past life that may be holding you back. It’s the comfort zone you need to break out of to achieve your destiny. Having a south node in Capricorn means you’re ambitious, hardworking, and an excellent leader. However, you make the Capricorn mistake of burying your emotions in the name of responsibility, which holds you back from a meaningful existence. [3] X Research source If you have a Capricorn south node, you’re likely a great leader who loves control. However, your life journey is about learning to give up that control and embrace vulnerability."

      "content": "Stop trying to fix everything. Because you have two cardinal signs pulling in both directions, you assume a ton of responsibility - even when things are completely out of your control. Remember that while you’re a nurturing and capable provider, there’s only so much you can do. [4] X Research source While it can be scary trying to give up control, learning to trust and let others take over will improve your emotional and spiritual well-being. While a life you can’t fully control is scary, it’s also exciting. An unpredictable life keeps it from being boring and monotonous."

      "title": "Be kind to yourself.",
      "content": "Be kind to yourself. Cancer placements have a tendency to be self-defeating. While it’s important for your spiritual growth that you learn to feel your “negative” emotions, remember they don’t affect who you are as a person. Because Cancer is such a selfless sign, you can fall victim to the misconception that self-kindness is selfish. But it’s just the opposite: being kinder to yourself is essential in making you a more complete and emotionally-available person to those around you. In this case, embracing your more Capricorn tendencies can be beneficial. When you feel like you’re being hard on yourself , try and pinpoint what factual evidence there is that’s causing this negative self-talk. Is there evidence to warrant this or is it all self-flagellating opinions?"

      "content": "Release your savior complex. Because Cancer placements are ruled by the moon, they’re great at being a beacon of light and leading others out of dark places. If you have a north node in Cancer, you’re learning to help others. While that’s so admirable, remember not to wear yourself too thin. Not everyone is deserving of your help. Instead of trying to solve everyone’s problems, focus on actively listening. Just having a supportive friend is often enough. Look inward if you feel your saviorism is a result of your own codependence and reach out for counseling if you feel like this pattern is preventing you from having quality relationships."

      "content": "Set aside some time to feel. With a south node in Saturnian Capricorn, it’s likely you’re more comfortable repressing your emotions and focusing on solutions. However, your life journey is all about learning to register the power of each feeling. Joy, anger, and sadness won’t harm your productivity; in fact, giving yourself the space to feel them will make you a more skilled emotionally-articulate person. Stop judging your feelings! Learning not to separate emotions into categories of “good” and “bad” is essential to developing emotional intelligence.

      "content": "Learn to be vulnerable. Despite what your south node in Capricorn may be telling you, vulnerability is nothing to be ashamed of. To truly forge relationships with people, you need to tell them how you feel even when (heck, ESPECIALLY when) it feels scary. [6] X Research source Allow them to be there for you in the same way you’re there for them. Building trust with others is a long process. Be patient and have reasonable expectations for how you’d like your loved ones to have your back. With a Capricorn south node, it’s likely you’re a creature of staunch routine. One great way to embrace vulnerability is to try new things."

      "content": "Start a family (chosen or otherwise). Having a north node Cancer placement is all about achieving happiness in your family life. And, with a moon domicile, you’re naturally great with children and have excellent parental instincts. Whether it’s taking things to the next level with your romantic partner or simply getting a pet, you’re likely to be fulfilled by creating some sort of family structure. [7] X Research source Quality time is a superhero when it comes to creating a loving family. Find a block in your schedule to enjoy each other’s company on a regular basis. Not all families have to be biological. If your childhood family makes you feel small, it’s okay to cut them off."

      "content": "Set boundaries with your partner. With a north node in Cancer, you’re great at picking up on, and even absorbing people’s energies. While this makes you empathetic and compassionate, if you don’t set boundaries for yourself, you can get caught up taking on other people’s emotional burdens. Prioritize your feelings even higher than the person you’re dating. [8] X Research source Trust that your loved ones will come to you with their feelings when they’re ready. If you pick up on something, try to let it be and give them emotional space."

[10] X Research source Try to avoid jobs that are high-stress or too fast-paced. A Cancer north node is all about embracing your more intimate personality and appreciating life’s quieter side."

      "content": "Accept that there’s more to life than work. Capricorn is known as “the workaholic of the zodiac” and, because your south node represents your comfort zone, you likely find solace in putting your nose to the grindstone. But your lifetime goal is learning to step outside your comfort zone and discover that your personal connections to those around you are even more enriching than your career. [11] X Research source Leaning away from workaholism can be as simple as finding a fulfilling hobby. Whether it’s cooking, crafting, or photography, other activities should make you feel as valued as work. Doing activities with loved ones can be a great way to ease into emotional intimacy without much pressure. Try going on a hike or doing a DIY craft together."

Lean away from your overly earnest Capricorn south node and embrace your playful side. Whether it’s taking a personal day and going on a day trip, setting up a weekly game night or playing harmless pranks at the office, learn to have fun! Playing games you liked as a kid like hide-and-seek is a great way to re-establish connection to your inner child. As a Capricorn south node, responsibility comes natural to you. Behaving a little wild every now and then won’t hurt you; in fact, it’ll help balance you out."

Your Capricorn south node likely means you ignore the emotional side of both these things in the name of more earthly qualities. You argue with logic and sex for you is compartmentalized as physical.
