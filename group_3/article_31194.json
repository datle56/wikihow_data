If the smaller number is between 20 and 99, you'll have to do some extra work to figure out the tens component. As a result, you'll probably find it easier to just do traditional long multiplication. You can also use this method with a 3-digit smaller number as well—in that case, you'll need to break it up into hundreds, tens, and ones. For example, 162 would become 100, 60, and 2.
