      "content": "Using a sharp knife, cut a shallow line around the middle of each potato. This is called “scoring,” and it will help you peel the skin off easily once you’ve boiled the potatoes. [1] X Research source You only need to cut about ¼ inch deep (.6 cm) around the center of the potato, like an equator. Don't forget to wash your potatoes before boiling them."

      "content": "Place your potatoes in a pot with plenty of water, and boil them. Make sure your potatoes are fully submerged, with the water covering them by at least 1-2 inches (2.5 - 5 cm). [2] X Research source Bring the water to a boil and let your potatoes cook."

      "content": "Cook your potatoes until they’re fork-tender. A good-size pot with 6-7 potatoes will take around 15 minutes to cook through. You may need more or less time, depending on how many potatoes you’re dealing with. When you think they’re done, try piercing one with a fork. If the fork punctures the skin and slides right in, you’re good to go!"

      "content": "Remove the potatoes from the pot and place them in an ice bath. Have a bowl of ice water ready for when your potatoes are done. With tongs or a large spoon (do not touch the potatoes directly), grab each potato and put them in the bowl of ice cold water for about 5-10 seconds. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Peel off the skin. Here’s the magic part: place your thumbs on the line where you’ve scored each potato, and pull the skin gently. It should feel very loose and slide off easily, leaving a perfectly peeled potato in its wake!"

      "title": "Wash your potatoes thoroughly.",
      "content": "Wash your potatoes thoroughly. It’s important to clean your potatoes even though you’ll be peeling them. Unwashed potatoes can have germs, dirt, and pesticides on their skin, and peeling can transfer these things to the inside of the potato. [4] X Trustworthy Source Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Main public health institute for the US, run by the Dept. of Health and Human Services Go to source So, before you start peeling, scrub your potatoes under cold water using a vegetable scrubbing brush or a clean dish towel. [5] X Research source As you wash your potatoes, check to make sure there’s no signs of spoilage. Wrinkly skin, soft spots, sour smells, and mold are all signs that a potato has gone bad . [6] X Research source If you notice any small roots or sprouts coming out of the potatoes (also called eyes) remove them. Many potato peelers have a scoop-shaped tip at the base of the handle for this purpose, but you can also use a knife to cut the eyes out. [7] X Research source Once your potatoes are clean, thoroughly dry them to ensure the best texture. [8] X Research source"

This way you don’t end up with bits of potato skin all over your kitchen. You can also rest the bottom of the potato against a cutting board if you prefer. [9] X Research source"

      "content": "Starting at the top, slowly drag the peeler across the potato. Peel in a downward motion away from your body, rather than toward it, and be careful not to get too close to the tips of your fingers holding the potato.

      "title": "Peel the top and bottom of the potato.",
      "content": "Peel the top and bottom of the potato. Maneuver the peeler around the curves at the top and bottom of the potato as best you can. If you miss any small spots, go back over them with small strokes."

      "content": "Peel through any dark spots. You may find that as you expose the inside of the potato, you see dark spots. This is normal—few potatoes are perfect! Focus on this area and keep peeling until you’ve peeled away the dark layers entirely. Sometimes the dark “meat” of the potato goes pretty deep. If this is the case, cut out the area with a knife or the edge of your peeler. The potato won't be perfectly round, but it'll still be good to eat."

Try to slice the skin off in the thinnest layers possible, but if you see any eyes or dark spots, cut out a deeper chunk to remove them completely. [14] X Research source Make sure to keep your fingers out of the blade’s path as you rotate the potato, and go slowly to avoid any injuries."
