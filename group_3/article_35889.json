      "content": "The honeymoon phase is the fun, passionate stage at the start of a relationship. It’s that stage when you and your partner can’t get enough of each other. Everything is new and exhilarating. During the honeymoon phase , you’re intensely attracted to your partner, and you tend to idealize them and overlook their potential flaws. Basically, you’re falling in love and experiencing all of the excitement and euphoria that comes with it."

      "title": "According to most experts, yes, the honeymoon phase does have to end.",
      "content": "According to most experts, yes, the honeymoon phase does have to end. Part of what makes the honeymoon phase so exciting is that everything is still new. But eventually, experts say, that newness runs out and partners become more familiar with each other. On top of that, the realities of being in a relationship (bills, conflicting schedules, family dynamics, etc.) start to set in the longer you’ve been together, which usually isn’t as exciting as falling in love."

      "title": "There’s even a scientific reason why the honeymoon phase ends.",
      "content": "There’s even a scientific reason why the honeymoon phase ends. When two people fall in love, it actually changes their brain activity and chemistry. Each person’s brain produces more dopamine (nicknamed the “happy hormone”) and nerve growth factor, a protein that increases feelings of euphoria. These changes aren’t permanent, though. Eventually, brain activity and chemistry go back to normal, meaning those intense, pleasurable feelings couples experience during the honeymoon phase start to subside. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "The end of the honeymoon phase doesn’t mean the love is gone though.",
      "content": "The end of the honeymoon phase doesn’t mean the love is gone though. The intense whirlwind of emotions you experience during the beginning of your relationship may fade with time, but the love doesn’t have to. All long-term relationships experience this. After the honeymoon phase, you and your partner might face more challenges and idealize each other less, but you’ll also have the chance to develop a deeper, more genuine connection. You’ll learn to accept each other for who you really are (without the rose-tinted glasses), and you’ll bond over the obstacles you overcome together."

      "title": "The honeymoon phase typically lasts several months to 2 years.",
      "content": "The honeymoon phase typically lasts several months to 2 years. Every relationship is different, so there’s no one-size-fits-all timeframe for the honeymoon phase. However, most couples experience the end of the honeymoon phase at some point during the first 2 years of being together. With that said, some couples might find that they’re in the honeymoon phase for longer! [2] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Surprise each other.",
      "content": "Surprise each other. Part of what makes the honeymoon phase so exciting is the sense of mystery. A great way to keep that mystery alive is to surprise your partner with something they weren’t expecting you to do. It could be a spontaneous date night, a small gift they’ve been wanting, or a day trip to the small town they’ve been wanting to visit. [3] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Plan regular date nights.",
      "content": "Plan regular date nights. Go on dates like you did when you were first falling in love to keep the spark alive. Make them exciting dates, too. Get dressed up, go somewhere nice or new, and ditch your phones so you can really connect. Instead of talking about work, bills, or anything stressful, talk about new and interesting topics, like an article you read that morning or something you want to try together as a couple."

      "content": "Communicate with each other. Consistent communication helps you feel closer and more connected with your partner. Make time every day to talk about how you’re feeling and to really listen to each other. Is anything upsetting you? Are you feeling happy and fulfilled? Let your partner know what’s really going on. Having these conversations regularly will help keep the connection and intimacy alive in your relationship. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Handle conflict in a healthy way. If you’re at a point in your relationship where disagreements are becoming more common, it doesn’t mean your relationship is doomed. Conflict is a normal part of healthy relationships. The important thing is to handle it in a healthy way so you come out stronger as a couple on the other side. That means staying calm and respectful when arguments escalate, avoiding personal attacks and insults, and working together to find common ground. [6] X Research source"
