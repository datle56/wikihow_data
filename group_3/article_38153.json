Putting them all together in a photo album is a wonderful way to commemorate your friendship and give your friend a keepsake to take to his or her new home. [2] X Research source If you have digital photos, print them out on photo paper and use a scissors to cut them out. Pick out a photo album from the store - you can find inexpensive albums at drugstores - or make your own if you're the crafty type. Write captions underneath the photos. You can write about what you remember from the day the photo was taken, or write down inside jokes the two of you share. You can create an online photo album instead. That way, both of you will have a copy,"

      "content": "Make a friendship bracelet . This is a classic way to show a friend you care. Friendship bracelets are trendy, thoughtful gifts for both boys and girls, and they're not hard to make. Go to a craft store and buy some embroidery thread, then braid or weave it in a colorful pattern. Tie the ends together and clip the excess thread. Make matching bracelets, one for you and one for your friend, so that you'll think of each other when you look at them. You can buy friendship bracelets or necklaces made from silver or gold if you want to go for something more expensive. Choose the classic broken heart halves (one for you, the other for your friend) or a variety of other available designs."

      "content": "Give your friend a care package. Moving to a new place can be hard. Chances are your friend will need several weeks to get adjusted, and she won't feel at home for a long time. Giving her a care package filled with things that remind her of home will help her feeling comforted when she's missing you and her old town. [3] X Research source Choose a container for the package. You can decorate a box, use a gift bag, or repurpose a tote bag or purse. Add a few things that represent your hometown. You could include incense or candles from your favorite shop, a book from the bookstore where you've always hung out together, or a mug from the coffee shop where you met before school. Include some tasty comfort foods. Make your friend a batch of cookies to enjoy on the flight to her new city, or slip in an array of her favorite candy."

      "content": "Reflect on your friendship. Saying goodbye is actually a unique opportunity to think back on your friendship and tell your friend how much it has meant to you. It's not often friends get the chance to do that, so take advantage. Writing it all down in a letter is cathartic, and your friend will be able to treasure it forever. [4] X Research source Write down your recollection of how you met. Do you remember the first time you and your friend hit it off? Sometimes you just know when someone you meet is going to end up being a great friend. Write down some of your favorite memories. Recall movies you saw together, concerts you attended, fun sleepovers you had. If you want, open your heart even more. You can talk about the bad times, too, and how much the two of you have grown as friends as a result of overcoming them."

That's a good way to spend time with her and help her reduce the stress of moving. She may be busy with her family during those last few days. If that's the case, drop by for an hour or so to say your goodbyes."

      "content": "Tell your friend how you feel. There's no one way to say \"goodbye.\" The best way to do it is to be truthful about how you feel. Even if you aren't entirely eloquent, your friend will know how much you care. The warmth and love you express will bolster her courage to move to a new place and start over. It can be hard to directly express deep feelings to someone else, but now is the time to do it. Tell your friend you love her and will miss her. Sometimes \"goodbye\" is too hard to say. A hug and a sincere smile will tell your friend everything she needs to know."
