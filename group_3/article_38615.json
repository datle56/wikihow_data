      "content": "Assess your lifestyle and drinking habits. While many people can consume alcohol occasionally with no trouble, some develop a dangerous addiction. If you've experienced one or more of the following symptoms, you may be an alcoholic and should consider quitting drinking. [1] X Research source Drinking in the morning. Drinking alone. Feelings of guilt after drinking. Making attempts to hide your drinking from others. You have difficulty stopping yourself once you have one drink.

      "title": "Evaluate your goal.",
      "content": "Evaluate your goal. After you've decided that you should cut back on alcohol or quit altogether, you need to set a concrete goal. If your goal is to quit completely, write out \"I will stop drinking alcohol on this date.\" Set a specific date on which you will quit. This will give you a tangible target to aim for. Perhaps you don't want to quit entirely, but for health reasons you decide you'd like to only drink on Friday and Saturday. This is called \"harm reduction.\" Write out a goal like, \"As of this date, I will only drink on Fridays and Saturdays.\" Again, it is important to set a concrete date for when this will start. Build up your ability to be aware of how many drinks you have consumed and how you are feeling in a given amount of time. Rather than choosing how many drinks to allow yourself, increase your ability to be aware of when you are drinking too quickly or drinking more when around strangers. The more you know about your drinking, the better you will be able to control it. If you only plan on reducing your intake, you may or may not need a full detox. Depending on how heavily you currently drink, detox may still be necessary. Any significant reduction in an addictive substance can lead to withdrawal."

Let the people around you know what you will require of them. It may be as simple as asking them to not offer you drinks, or you may need them to not drink around you at all. Whatever your needs are, make sure you are up front about them. It is especially important to make your goals clear to friends who you used to drink with. Peer pressure causes many people to cave. If these people do not support your goal and pressure you to drink, you may need to distance yourself from them."

There are a number of dangers associated with a detox and you may need medical help. While some people plan on detoxing alone and calling 911 if they need help, this isn't a safe plan. Withdrawal symptoms can progress very quickly and you could lose consciousness before you can reach the phone. This means you'll need someone there in case of emergencies. He will have to stay with you 24 hours a day for the first 3 days at least, and will have to check in on you regularly for the rest of the week. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Stock your home with food and water. You may not feel up to leaving your home, and your partner shouldn't leave you alone for the first few days. It's very important to have several days' worth of fresh food in your house along with several gallons of water for times. Freeze small dishes to make meals easily when you aren't feeling well. You'll want healthy foods to replace the nutrients you're losing by detoxing. Some good choices when shopping are: Fresh fruits and vegetables. High-protein food like chicken, fish, or peanut butter. Oats, to help control blood sugar. Soup. People often lose their appetites during withdrawal, so soft foods like soup are good to have around. Vitamin supplements. It is common for heavy drinkers to have vitamin deficiencies, so to stay healthy you'll have to replace these nutrients. Some good choices are vitamin B, C, and magnesium supplements. Only use supplements your doctor has approved."

In the early hours of the detox, you can write a letter from your drinking self to your sober self reflecting why you want to quit drinking, and your hopes for the future. When the physical withdrawal symptoms make the process tough, you can read this letter for motivation. Who do you hope to be? What are you ashamed of? Don't push away negative emotions. Write out who you are quitting drinking for, who you have hurt, how you have hurt yourself and those you love. Write out the values you'd like to live by and why."

From: Najavits LM. “Seeking Safety”: A Treatment Manual for PTSD and Substance Abuse When a craving hits, use your senses to ground yourself by noticing what's right in front of you. Keep going for as long as it takes for the craving to pass. You can rotate among several techniques if one isn't working. Practice the following techniques: Describe the details of your environment without judging them. For example, you could notice that the carpet is thick and soft, the walls are blue, there's a crack in the ceiling, and the air smells fresh. Distract yourself by naming items in a category, such as types of fruit or countries in alphabetical order. Ground yourself physically by doing a simple exercise or running your hands over a textured surface. Think pleasant thoughts: name your favorite foods or your favorite TV characters. Think or say aloud a statement that helps you cope, like \"I've got this.\""

Practice saying \"no.\" You won't always be able to avoid every situation that involves alcohol, so you should prepare yourself to turn down a drink if it's offered. Distract yourself when having a craving. You can do this by taking a walk, listening to music, going for a drive, or any other activity that helps you forget about the alcohol craving. Talk to people. Be open about your cravings and don't try to hide them. If you have a sober sponsor or mentor, talk to him whenever you have a craving or are feeling weak.
