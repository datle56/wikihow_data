      "content": "Broaden your horizons. Don't get sucked in to thinking that you can find girls only to date when you're out at a party or at the bar or pub. You never know where or when you might meet a girl who would be open to a night out with you if you play your cards right. The saying “there are plenty of fish in the sea” reflects this fact. If you want to find a girl to pick up, keep your eyes open everywhere you go: at work, in cafes, on the street, pretty much anywhere public. That being said, there are a couple of important things to keep in mind: [1] X Research source A supermarket pickup is a hard sell. Most people don't go to the grocery store or the bank because they are hoping to find romance, which is why the conventional wisdom rightly suggests that bars, clubs, and parties are the best places to meet potential dates. Do not expect a good response if you try picking up girls in places they have to go because life demands it. Instead, consider open-air markets, cafes, and other places people go because they want to be out. It is likely that girls in such places will be at least somewhat more receptive to meeting new people, since they are not on important business. Unless you are hoping to become some sort of Don Juan (note: you will not succeed if this is your plan), perform a “ring test” before hitting on anyone. Is the girl wearing a band or diamond-set ring on either ring finger (or both)? If so, she is likely married (left hand) or engaged to be married (right hand). Respect that and leave her alone."

      "content": "Understand the (straight) male-female dynamic. This varies widely from country to country, but generally speaking, there is a clear paradigm in the Western world (that is, Europe, Australia, and North America) that defines what men and women find attractive in the opposite sex. It's actually very complicated, but at the most basic level, it works like this: Women are primarily attracted to social power and influence; men are primarily attracted to fertility and health (which is why Western culture is obsessed with making women look youthful). There is a whole universe of things that men can do to suggest social power and thus become more attractive. Consider developing a strong sense of style or a clever sense of humor. Physical wealth is a strong display of social power, which is why some guys maintain beautiful cars even though they're otherwise living in poverty. Think about how you can accentuate your life to emphasize your own strengths. The most basic and perhaps most useful way to show that you have social power is to be confident. By demonstrating an ability to speak and act in a self-assured manner, you can show that you have nothing to fear from other men, which makes you seem relatively powerful. This is why it is often said that confidence is everything in the dating world. Become confident , and the rest of the pickup game boils down to details; fail to exhibit confidence, and you will always struggle to get dates. [2] X Research source"

Women are very perceptive and will not take you seriously if you're disrespecting them by pretending to be someone or something you're not. On the other hand, women aren't looking for a mess to clean up, either. One of the greatest benefits of a long-term relationship is having the freedom to share your worries and fears with someone who loves you, but right now, you aren't in a long-term relationship - you're washing laundry next to someone with a cute smile and a funny T-shirt. Don't lose perspective. The pickup is your chance to show off all there is to like about you, not an excuse to start unloading on a girl who was nice enough to listen. [3] X Research source"

[4] X Expert Source Patti Novak Williams Professional Matchmaker & Dating Coach Expert Interview. 12 January 2021. Body language is the primary way that human beings communicate emotional states to each other, making it an all-important “language” to learn if you want to be at the top of your dating game. The rules of thumb are as follows: [5] X Research source More eye contact is better than less eye contact. Smile whenever you make eye contact. Don't look away until you've smiled. Don't stare. Try to keep your eyes from glancing at a woman's body if you're talking to her. Adopt an open stance: legs and arms uncrossed, shoulders back, head level. This makes you appear confident, relaxed, and receptive. Don't mumble. Speak clearly and without hesitation. Lean in slightly to the person you're interested in when you speak to her. Bringing your head slightly forward is fine if you're seated."

      "content": "Never forget: body language is powerful, but it's not always clear. For example, people tend to touch the parts of themselves they think are attractive when they are attracted to someone. A girl who keeps touching her lips or chest with one hand as she talks to you might be interested; then again, she could just be itchy. Take any cues you think you see with a grain of salt."

This is why slowly trying to win over a woman's heart by ingratiating yourself to her never seems to work: women want a man who will come right out and say how he feels. [6] X Expert Source Patti Novak Williams Professional Matchmaker & Dating Coach Expert Interview. 12 January 2021. If he really is interested enough to want a date, he should be willing to risk rejection for the sake of the chance. Even women who are very attracted to you won't wait around for you to ask them out forever. They'll either decide that you aren't attracted to them and give up, or that you aren't attractive because you were never brave enough to ask for a date. When you feel attracted to a girl, if you don't ask her out the same day you realize you want to date her, assume you have around a month at most to make your intentions known. Don't wait for a perfect moment."

It doesn't have to be anything especially exciting – just an invitation to talk. Try bringing up the weather if you're outside, or the decor if you're somewhere indoors. At a party, bring up something about the party or ask how she met the host or hostess. Just have a starting line picked out before you begin."

[7] X Expert Source Patti Novak Williams Professional Matchmaker & Dating Coach Expert Interview. 12 January 2021. Talking to someone you've only just met is challenging for both of you. If you make it easier for her she'll appreciate it. Try offering a few opinions on something inconsequential, such as the music in the background. Keep it honest, and see how she responds. Listen to what she says and ask her for more details about her opinion. [8] X Expert Source Patti Novak Williams Professional Matchmaker & Dating Coach Expert Interview. 12 January 2021. By putting yourself out there first, you are making it safe for her to follow suit and agree or disagree with your opinion. Try not to turn the conversation into an interview, asking things like: “What do you do?” “Where do you live?” “Where did you go to school?” in rapid succession. Instead, turn such questions into statements (like \"You look like you're from Rome\" or \"I bet you're an event planner\"). You'll seem bolder and give her room to respond more naturally, which will help her relax and enjoy the talk."

On the other hand, someone who lets your jokes fall flat is probably neither interested in you nor worth pursuing, which makes humor a great way to test the waters without being awkwardly upfront about it. [9] X Research source Even if you think your sense of humor is too quick, subtle, or strange for most people to appreciate or understand, unleash it during your conversation. If the girl you're talking to is interested, she'll hang on your jokes and laugh at them even when other people don't."

When you find a way to give her a compliment or a flirt that doesn't break the flow of the conversation, go for it; otherwise, keep your pickup lines to yourself. [10] X Research source The only possible responses a woman can give to a blatant compliment are to agree with it (in which case she seems full of herself), disagree (in which case she seems embarrassed), or throw the compliment back at you, which is generally unlikely, especially early on in the conversation. It's more important to show that you're fun company than it is to explicitly state that you find her attractive, which should already have been obvious from the fact that you came over and started running your game on her."

Most girls prefer the guy who builds robots in his basement and has the moxie to say so with a smile over the guy who acts ashamed or embarrassed about it. Don't be afraid to make gentle criticisms (making them in the form of questions, as in “but isn't that kind of silly?” is a good way to do this) or gentle jokes at her expense, as long as you don't make very many. Girls appreciate it when a guy seems interested but not dazzled, because it means he's less likely to become too attached too quickly and make things uncomfortable for them. On the other hand, someone who's constantly making mean jokes at her expense is just going to seem rude and childish."

If she says she doesn't want to give you her number, be gracious and wish her a good rest of the day.

Instead, suggest something that will give you both room to talk, and which does not cost a lot of money. Have an idea and a couple of alternates ready ahead of time; most women prefer it when the man decides on the date. [12] X Research source If you have a guess about something out of the ordinary that you think she'll appreciate, such as renting a paddle boat, suggest that; otherwise, stick to lunch, coffee, or drinks somewhere. All of these options provide plenty of opportunities for uninterrupted conversation and (if you're lucky) a first kiss. Offer to pay for the first date, but don't insist on it. Some women find the notion that a man should pay for every date insulting, and will prefer to split costs with you or pay their own way. Whatever your date prefers, go along with it. [13] X Research source Give her some space. This is a first date, not a marriage contract. Once you've settled on a time and place, don't call her again until it's time to meet. You'll have plenty of time to talk then. If she calls and asks to reschedule, give her the benefit of the doubt – after all, if she wanted to reject you, she could already have done so before now.

It may very well be that you do love your friend, but saying it won't change anything because it doesn't give her any concrete reason to consider dating you. It's better to keep your feelings on the down low and treat your offer like any other. Make sure you're very clear that you're asking for a romantic date, and not just a time to hang out.

The closer you are to someone outside of your dating life, the more likely it is that dating or otherwise pursuing that person will eventually lead to drama and misery. At work, this means you're better off trying to pick up a girl you don't work with very closely or very often, if you can help it at all. If you work at a large business like a department store or a major business office, try to focus on picking up girls who work in other departments than your own.

Think about it from the girl's perspective: She's there because she needs a job, not because she thought there were a lot of cute boys behind the counter when she was job hunting. Anything that makes her job more stressful is going to ripple throughout her life, because she can't afford to just stop showing up on account of one uncomfortable exchange with a coworker. Never put a girl in the position of dreading work more than she already would have before you asked her out. Be brief, be polite, and if you are rejected, don't press the issue or otherwise bother her afterward. Even if you think you're being friendly, chances are she's not going to appreciate you continuing to step into her sphere after she already said no. Give her plenty of space."

If you're going to pursue a woman at work, don't spread your intentions around. [17] X Research source As long as work continues more or less the same as it did yesterday, your bosses won't personally mind one bit if you try to pick up a girl on the job, or even end up regularly dating her.

Besides, some women find the idea of a date with someone who's “just passing through” intriguing or exciting, because there are likely to be no strings attached. You won't know until you make it clear that you're in that situation. Traveling also makes for an interesting topic of conversation, so you probably won't have to try very hard to find things to talk about. Just mention that you're just visiting for a few days, and ask a question about the local area.

Ask her for ideas on where to go, and offer to pay the tab (as usual).

No momentary impulse or minor crush is worth jeopardizing the relationship you already have. If you believe you're ready to end that relationship, do the right thing and end it first .
