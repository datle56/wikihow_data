      "title": "The Shag",
      "content": "The Shag The ‘70s shag is one of the most iconic men’s haircuts that defined the decade—and it’s definitely come full circle as one of today’s most popular hair trends! In the 1970s, the shag hairstyle was symbolic of a break from conventional men’s grooming styles and a move toward bohemian self-expression. Shag cuts are heavily layered and textured, with the longest layers traditionally hitting at the shoulders—although shorter (mid-neck length) and longer (past shoulder-length) shags have become more popular in the modern era. [1] X Research source Styling Tips: For a classic medium-length shag , see a stylist to get the cut done. Then, use a texture or salt spray to keep it sleek, and let it air dry to bring out the natural texture. [2] X Research source For a short shag , go for a look similar to the modern mop top . Spritz texturizing spray onto towel-dried hair, then blow dry following the grain of your hair. Apply a matte styling clay or powder to arrange the shaggy pieces to your liking. Short shags require slightly more upkeep, with a trim suggested every 4-5 weeks. For a long shag , you mostly want to let your hair do its thing! However, you might add volumizing or texturizing mousse to give it some movement and prevent it from laying flat. A deep side part can also help to add volume, as does clipping the front pieces back to add dimension and keep them from falling into your face.

      "content": "Feathered Hair (Short and Medium Cuts) Feathered hair was everywhere in the 1970s, and it definitely made an appearance among the most popular men’s hairstyles! Emulating the free-spirited era, feathered cuts typically featured layered hair that was brushed back and away from the face to create a ~feathered~ effect. [3] X Research source Styling Tips: For a short feathered cut , you can either let your hair dry totally naturally, or work in a little styling cream to hydrate your hair before blow drying. [4] X Research source For a medium-to-long feathered cut , add a dime-size amount of styling cream or a few spritzes of detangling spray . Apply the product evenly with your hands, following your natural growth pattern. Finally, blow dry! Get Hair Inspo From: Robert Redford (1970s-era, short feathered hair) , Barry Gibb c. 1976 (1970s-era, medium feathered hair) , Christian Bale c. 2011 (modern) . You can also totally rock ‘70s layered hair without the feathering! You might be interested in a shag, or simply just a medium-length layered cut (à la Dev Patel). Styling for this cut is similar to the medium-length feathered cut: add moisture and definition with a light styling cream, then let your hair air dry naturally."

      "content": "Long and Sleek Long hair had its heyday in the ‘70s when mainstream culture began to break from the norms of men having exclusively short hair. [5] X Research source One of these lengthy styles included super long and super sleek locks—to achieve this look, men of the ‘70s basically just had to let their hair grow, grow, and keep on growing. Styling Tips: Get trims every 8-12 weeks to remove split ends while also moving toward your hair growth goals. [6] X Research source To keep your hair as sleek as can be, tame flyaways with a light leave-in conditioner after washing and spritz with hairspray to add texture and hold.

      "content": "Long and Wavy (or Curly) Depending on your hair texture, a wavy or curly long-hair look may be more up your alley—and the 1970s definitely loved a wave! Long, textured hair was a definitive style of the ‘70s, with men’s messy waves and curls marking a shift from the short, tamed haircuts of decades past. Whether your hair is more wavy or curly, you can definitely channel the free-spirited vibes of this long-locked and laidback ‘70s style. [7] X Research source Styling Tips: This cut is inherently low-maintenance—hence its association with ‘70s rock-n-roll. But if you’d like to add some polish, spritz on a salt spray from root to mid-length for volume, then let your hair air dry naturally.

During the ‘70s, so-called “California surfer” hairstyles for men were long, tousled, laidback, and sun-kissed—as if the wearer had spent the whole day lounging on the sand or surfing the waves. [8] X Research source Just like most things in the ‘70s, the goal here was to look as effortless and counterculture as possible—even though mainstream teen icons like Leif Garrett were seen sporting the surfer style. [9] X Research source Styling Tips: Dunk your hair in ocean water! Or , if that’s not super convenient for you, simply spritz a bit of sea salt spray over your hair and scrunch it through to your ends. Then, let your hair dry into a naturally tousled texture.

      "title": "Wet Curl",
      "content": "Wet Curl The wet look wasn’t invented on TikTok! In fact, men in the 1970s were already rocking the wet look in the form of a wet curl. This ‘70s hairstyle featured a long mane of tightly spiraled curls that had the look (and feel) of being perpetually wet and sleek. Often, the wet curl cut was paired with a set of curly bangs and facial hair (ideally a handlebar mustache). [10] X Research source Styling Tips: This look works best for people with naturally curly hair—if that’s you, follow the curl routine for your hair type. However, focus on hydrating products and add them to your wet hair: try hydrating curling cream or a mixture of curl gel and pomade. Then, blow dry your hair with a diffuser and finish with a hydrating hair oil to add some extra sheen! Get Hair Inspo From: Rick James (1970s-era) , Kit Harington c. 2015 (modern) ."

      "content": "Tight Perm We already know that curls were all the rage in the ‘70s, so we wouldn’t dare forget about the iconic perm! The perm (or permanent wave) is a chemical treatment that allows even men with stick-straight hair to achieve a defined curl. However, since perms result from chemical processes, they can damage the hair if not maintained properly, so it’s crucial to hydrate a perm and use products geared toward this trend-setting haircut. [11] X Research source Styling Tips: Avoid wetting your hair for two days after a perm. Then, use only shampoos and conditioners that are specifically designed for permed hair. Apply leave-in conditioner between washes and deep condition your perm once a week. Get Hair Inspo From: Robert Reed (1970s-era) , Chris Martin c. 2013 (modern) ."

      "title": "Jheri Curl",
      "content": "Jheri Curl The Jheri curl hairstyle was first developed in the ‘70s by a hairstylist named Jheri Redding (who went on to found and co-found haircare brands Nexxus and Redken!). [12] X Research source Redding ended up inventing the Jheri curl after experimenting with chemicals to use on hair, and this look was later adapted and popularized by Black entrepreneur Comer Cottrell, whose influence led to Jheri curls becoming one of the most iconic hair looks for men in the Black community. [13] X Research source Jheri curls are considered by some to be a type of perm, but they’re mainly used to transform tighter curls into a glossier, more loosely-curled look—versus perms, which are aimed at naturally straight hair. Jheri curls also have a “wet” look and feel to them, and the chemicals they use are more nourishing than perming chemicals. [14] X Research source While getting Jheri curls may traditionally require chemical treatments, newer methods exist that don’t use chemicals to achieve the look. Styling Tips: In the mornings, flip your head over and separate the curls to prevent them from sticking together. Apply a daily curl activator and moisturizer onto wet hair, using a scrunching method to work the products into your hair. If you want more hold in your curls, rake a curl-defining hair gel through your locks. Then, air dry your hair or use a diffuser on a low heat setting.

      "title": "Afro",
      "content": "Afro The afro became a hugely popular look among the Black community in the 1970s—symbolizing racial pride, cultural identity, and self-acceptance. The cut served as a visual connection to African heritage, a celebration of natural hair, and a rejection of cultural norms—making it a cornerstone in the ‘70s era’s continual move toward unity, cultural awakening, and dismissal of Westernized beauty standards. [15] X Research source Styling Tips: Consult with a trusted barber for the best afro shape and style for your hair texture and desired look. Once shaped and grown out , use a few pumps of light hair oil or scrunches of softening cream to create texture and seal in moisture. Then, use a hair pick or hair sponge to style into your preferred shape.

Bob Marley, who converted to the Rastafari faith at 21-years-old, helped to popularize locks as the reggae artist became one of the most coveted musical icons of the ‘70s. [17] X Research source Throughout the decade, locs continued to grow as a symbol of cultural pride for Black people that allowed them to embrace their African heritage and features. [18] X Research source Styling Tips: Locks are formed by matting hair strands together through twisting, braiding, backcombing, or palm rolling. Once starter locs are formed, avoid using conditioners and detanglers, and shampoo infrequently at the beginning. After about 1-2 months, you can begin to regularly condition and wash the locs before styling them however you’d like—in twists, braids, wraps, and more.

[20] X Research source Instead, wearing braids with beads allowed people to celebrate their tradition, culture, and individuality in a customizable and creative way. [21] X Research source Styling Tips: Keep your braids moisturized with a hydrating braid spray , or by applying a warmed-up oil like olive, almond, or coconut oil onto your hair.

It’s easy to see why this 1970s look is so popular: pair the versatile cut with a blazer and you’re ready for an important investor meeting, pair it with a leather jacket, and you’re a mysterious bad boy straight out of American Graffiti or Happy Days .

Originally, the men’s mod cut was characterized by a lot of volume on top with a helmet-like shape around the sides. In the ‘70s, the style mimicked these characteristics but with extra volume on top and the added bonus of hefty sideburns. [25] X Research source Styling Tips: Spritz hair with texturizing spray , then use your hands to make a scrunching motion at the top of your head to encourage texture and piecey sections.

Mod fashion and hairstyles experienced an interesting wave throughout the ‘70s—after hitting their peak in the ‘60s, mod-mania dipped in the early 1970s in favor of the “hippie” cultural movement and its associated styles.

The decade was a time of revolutionary change in many ways—from the continuing Civil Rights movement to hippie culture and Vietnam War protests, the ‘70s saw a cultural shift from the (more) conservative 1960s to a period of radicalism, rebellion, and individualism. [35] X Research source As with any cultural and political shift, these social and historical changes were paralleled by the style and fashion choices made by those living their daily lives during the 1970s. [36] X Research source Mainly, consumers and mainstream fashion placed more value than ever on self-expression, experimentation, and freedom in personal style. Pop culture trends and icons like disco and David Bowie also helped to cement a more rebellious, colorful, and free-flowing look. Popular ‘70s fashion styles included “hippie” styles like bell bottom pants, frayed jeans, loose maxi dresses, tie-dye, peasant blouses, ponchos, and feather jewelry. Men (and women) wore bright colors in textures like satin and patterns like corduroy, paisley, wool, crushed velvet, and flannel. Even on the more conservative side, 1970s looks had a lot of flair. In the early ‘70s, trendy clothing items included tight t-shirts, fitted wide-lapel blazers, flare-leg jeans, and eye-catching pastel shades of baby blue, yellow, mauve, and peach. Naturally, these expressive and individualistic styles extended to hair—especially men’s hair!
