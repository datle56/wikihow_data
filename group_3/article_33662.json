      "content": "Run the pyrite under lukewarm water to remove dust. When you first get your crystals, they may be dusty or dirty. Run them under lukewarm water to get them wet and remove the outside layer of grime. The initial cleaning won’t polish your crystals, but it will remove most of the outside dirt and chalk."

      "content": "Scrub the pyrite gently with the toothbrush. Pyrite crystals tend to have a lot of nooks and crannies, so use the toothbrush to really scrape out the dirt in any crevices. Use the toothbrush all over each crystal to get rid of grime and dirt. [2] X Expert Source Sam Lagor, MSc Geologist Expert Interview. 7 October 2021. You may see a black dust, but it’s just the crystals shedding their outside layer. You can also use a dentist pick remove the harder, crustier dirt from the surface. Try not to scratch the surface too much, though! [3] X Expert Source Sam Lagor, MSc Geologist Expert Interview. 7 October 2021."

      "content": "Rinse the pyrite with lukewarm water to remove any soap residue. Take all your crystals over to the sink and run them under lukewarm water. Make sure you rinse off all the soap residue, or your crystals might dry with streak marks on them. [4] X Research source You may have to rinse each crystal a few times to get rid of all the soap."

      "title": "Wipe the pyrite with a clean towel and leave it out to air dry.",
      "content": "Wipe the pyrite with a clean towel and leave it out to air dry. Grab a soft, clean towel and use it to dab most of the water off each crystal. Spread the crystals out on a towel and let them air dry completely for 4 to 5 hours before you store them. Air drying is much better than trying to dry with a towel, since pyrite crystals tend to have a lot of crevices that can trap moisture."

      "title": "Mix 2 parts distilled water with 1 part white vinegar in a container.",
      "content": "Mix 2 parts distilled water with 1 part white vinegar in a container. Fill up a pan or a bowl with a 2:1 ratio of distilled water and distilled white vinegar. White vinegar is mildly acidic, so it won’t ruin your crystals, but it will get rid of the remaining chalk on your crystals. For example, if you’re using 1 cup (240 mL) of distilled water, mix it with 1 ⁄ 2 cup (120 mL) of white vinegar. You can find distilled white vinegar at most grocery stores."

      "title": "Submerge the pyrite crystals in the vinegar for about 5 minutes.",
      "content": "Submerge the pyrite crystals in the vinegar for about 5 minutes. The vinegar won’t take long to dissolve any remaining chalk on your crystals. Make sure they’re all fully submerged, then set a timer for 5 minutes, keeping an eye on your crystals. If it seems like your crystals need more time, you can leave them in for up to 15 minutes. Try not to leave them for too much longer than that, or you could damage them."

      "title": "Rinse the crystals with lukewarm water.",
      "content": "Rinse the crystals with lukewarm water. Carefully grab all of the crystals out of the solution and carry them to the sink. Run them under lukewarm water until they don’t smell like vinegar anymore. You can pour your vinegar and water solution down the drain once you’re done. As you rinse your crystals, you may notice some of the chalk coming off."

      "content": "Set the crystals out to air dry before storing them. Wipe your crystals with a towel and then spread them out to air dry completely. Usually, this takes about 4 to 5 hours. Storing wet crystals can create mold or mildew."

      "content": "Mix a 2:1 ratio of water and oxalic acid in a bucket. Put on rubber gloves to protect your hands. In a large bucket, mix a 2:1 ratio of water and oxalic acid crystals with a metal stirrer. Start by pouring the water, then add in the oxalic acid, to avoid a dangerous reaction. [5] X Research source For example, if you’re using 1 gallon (3.8 L) of water, pour in 1/2 lb (0.22 kg) of oxalic acid crystals. You can find oxalic acid at most drug stores. Oxalic acid will turn your crystals a silvery, shiny color. If you want to keep them more natural looking, don’t use oxalic acid. Always add the water to the bucket first, then the acid. If you pour water on top of the acid, it could boil over and burn your hands."

      "content": "Submerge the crystals in the acid mixture for 30 minutes to 2 hours. Dump your pyrite crystals into the bucket and make sure they’re fully submerged. Keep an eye on your crystals to see how they change over time. You can leave the crystals in for as little as 30 minutes or as long as 2 hours. The longer you leave them in the acid mixture, the shinier they will be."

      "title": "Put on rubber gloves and remove the crystals from the mixture.",
      "content": "Put on rubber gloves and remove the crystals from the mixture. Pull on rubber gloves to protect your hands and gently pick out all of your pyrite crystals. Try not to splash or dump out any of the water and oxalic acid mixture. [6] X Research source To throw out your oxalic acid, slowly pour the mixture into a bucket of ice water. Then, add baking soda until the mixture stops bubbling. Test the pH of the acid mixture until it reaches 5.5, then pour it down your drain. [7] X Research source Never dump undiluted oxalic acid mixture down your drain, as it can harm living organisms in the water way."

      "title": "Rinse the crystals off with lukewarm water.",
      "content": "Rinse the crystals off with lukewarm water. Bring your crystals over to the sink and rinse them off thoroughly. Keep your gloves on the entire time, as you may still be touching oxalic acid. [8] X Research source The amount of oxalic acid going down your drain at this point is minimal, so it won’t harm anything."

      "title": "Neutralize the crystals in a mixture of baking soda and water.",
      "content": "Neutralize the crystals in a mixture of baking soda and water. In a separate bucket, mix a 2:1 ratio of baking soda and water. Drop the crystals in and leave them for about 5 minutes to neutralize the acid and stop the reaction. [9] X Research source If you don’t neutralize the acid, it will keep eating away at the crystals over time."

      "title": "Rinse the crystals with water again to remove any residue.",
      "content": "Rinse the crystals with water again to remove any residue. Pick the crystals out of the baking soda mixture and run them under lukewarm water again. Make sure there isn’t any residue left on the crystals before you wipe them with a towel. Be very gentle with the crystals as you rinse them, as they may be slightly fragile from the acid."

      "content": "Spread the crystals in a single layer out to air dry. Lay your pyrite crystals on a towel to air dry for about 4 to 5 hours, or until they’re not wet anymore. Enjoy your shiny, silvery crystals! Your crystals should stay shiny and clean for years to come. If they start getting dull or dirty, try cleaning them with a mild detergent."
