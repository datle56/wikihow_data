      "content": "Place your steaks on a countertop or on a cool stovetop to allow them to come to room temperature. Keep them covered or inside their packaging until you are ready to cook them. When the steak is at room temperature, it can quickly get to high-heat on the grill. Leave it cold and the centers will take too long to cook."

      "content": "Coat both sides of the steak with a liberal amount of salt and pepper. This will help you to create a crisper crust on the outside of your steak. Think of the salt as a light snow on a dark road -- you can still see the steak, but there is a light dusting on the entire piece of meat. Use the biggest grains of salt you can, such as course or kosher salt. Bigger grains dissolve slower, leading to a better crust on your steak. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Know that the type of grill you have will slightly change the flavor of your steaks. Depending on your grill, you can get very different flavors from your steak: Propane (Sear Burner): Gas grills don't give much flavor to the meat, but they are easy to adjust and toy with to get the perfect heat. They also get hot much, much faster than other grills. Charcoal: The classic choice, charcoal briquettes light up and get hot faster than woodchips. They give the classic rich, smoky flavor to the steaks. Wood-fire: Hickory or oak chips often give the best flavor to the meat. The trade-off? They are harder to light and keep ablaze. You can also use a mixture of charcoal and wood instead of just wood-chips."

The thinner your steaks are, the hotter you want the grill. This is because you don't want to cook the inside of the steak before the outside is a nice, crispy brown: 1/2 inch thick: 425-450°F. You shouldn't be able to hold your hand over the grill for more than 3 seconds. 3/4-1 inch thick: 360-400°F You shouldn't be able to hold your hand over the grill for more than 4-5 seconds. 1-1 1/2 inch thick: 325-360°F You shouldn't be able to hold your hand over the grill for more than 5-6 seconds.

It should have a lot of give. Well done: Using the same hand, touch your thumb and pinky together. For comparison, touch the fleshy part under your thumb with the opposite hand, holding your thumb and pinky together. It will be firm.
