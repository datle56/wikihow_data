      "content": "Prepare snacks to eat while you talk. Bring things you can snack on while you talk to your date. Think of snacks that don’t require the use of any utensils like nuts, chocolate, a cheese plate, or olives. Instead of cheap snacks like potato chips, use apple chips as an alternative. [2] X Research source Fruit like strawberries, blueberries, or cut up melon is a great snack. Hummus and pita bread are a romantic snack both of you can share. Just avoid the garlic variation. If you’re going to bring candy, try to keep it mature. Things like sugar-coated nuts or high-quality chocolate are better than the cheap stuff you’d find at a gas station."

      "content": "Pack some bubbly. You can pack champagne, non-alcoholic champagne, or even seltzer water in flutes for a picnic. If you’re younger or need to drive, you should pick the non-alcoholic alternatives. Champagne has long been known as one of the most romantic alcoholic beverages in our culture. If you’re on a tight budget, you can get sparkling wine as an alternative. Remember to bring a corkscrew so you can open the bottle! You can keep your drinks chilled with a cooler filled with ice.

      "content": "Make a dessert to increase the romance. If you don't bake you can pick up fresh cookies or specialty sweets like cannolis or chocolate croissants at a local bakery.

If you don’t feel confident with your baking skills, go with the instant bake items that are found in boxes. Looking for ideas?

      "content": "Bring silverware and avoid plastic utensils. Plastic utensils come off tacky and cheap so avoid using them unless you’re on a budget. Even if you’ve brought finger food, remember you may need a knife to apply spreads or to cut cheese. Bring a zip-lock bag so you can put dirty utensils in it after you’re done. Your silverware does not have to be expensive, just make sure it’s visually appealing."

While crystal flutes are the most formal, glass or even plastic ones are more appropriate for a special picnic. If you do use breakable glasses, keep them wrapped in cloth or a towel during transportation. Stemmed or stemless wine glasses could be nice alternatives to champagne flutes."

      "content": "Remember to bring napkins. It’s not romantic to have a conversation when there’s something on your mouth. Because a lot of the food you brought is eaten with your hands, it could get messy. For a more classy experience, cloth napkins are a good alternative to your typical disposable ones. Paper towels also work."

      "content": "Think of places your date enjoys. It’s easy to be romantic if your date is in a location that they already like. Do they like the woods and being around nature or would they rather be on the beach? Do they like the warm weather and being in the sun or are they the type of person who prefers shade? Take all of these things into consideration before picking your location. The wrong location will destroy the mood.

      "content": "Scout nearby gardens or beaches. If your date doesn’t like the woods, you can opt to go somewhere else. If they like the sand and ocean, then the beach is a great place to have a picnic. If the beach isn’t their thing, then finding a garden, or just a wide-open space outside is a good location for your romantic picnic. A secluded area is the best for a romantic picnic. Make sure to cover your food when on the beach or else sand will get in your food. Some places restrict the consumption of alcohol."
