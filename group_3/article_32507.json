      "title": "Cut off both ends of the dragon fruit using a sharp knife.",
      "content": "Cut off both ends of the dragon fruit using a sharp knife. Place the dragon fruit on a cutting board and chop off each end carefully. Hold the fruit in place to make sure it doesn’t move, and slice off enough of each end so that you cut into the pulp. [1] X Research source If you’ve chopped off an end and you can’t see the pulp, you need to cut off a little more."

      "title": "Create a cut along the length of the skin to keep the fruit whole.",
      "content": "Create a cut along the length of the skin to keep the fruit whole. If you want your dragon fruit peeled but not cut in half, make a shallow cut lengthwise down the skin. You want the cut to go all the way through the skin and lightly touch the pulp. [2] X Research source If you choose this method, it may take more effort to begin the peeling process, as your finger will have to wedge itself into the cut in the skin."

    {
      "title": "Slice the dragon fruit in half for an easy peeling process.",
      "content": "Slice the dragon fruit in half for an easy peeling process. Hold the dragon fruit steady and cut into it lengthwise. Cut each half of the dragon fruit in half again, creating 4 sections, if desired. [3] X Research source It’s easier to peel the dragon fruit when it’s in smaller wedges."

    {
      "title": "Peel the skin off slowly using your fingers.",
      "content": "Peel the skin off slowly using your fingers. [4] X Research source Situate your thumb in between the flesh and the skin if you cut the dragon fruit in half, or in the lengthwise cut you formed in the skin if you’re keeping the fruit whole. Use your fingers to start pulling off the skin slowly, moving your way along the dragon fruit. [5] X Research source Pull away from the dragon fruit to make the process easier."

      "title": "Remove any excess skin using a sharp knife.",
      "content": "Remove any excess skin using a sharp knife. If you’ve finished peeling off the skin and there are still remnants of it left, use a knife to remove these parts. Now your dragon fruit is ready to be eaten! [6] X Research source While it's debated as to whether dragon fruit skin is edible or not, most people agree you shouldn't eat the peel. Cut the dragon fruit into slices or cubes, or keep it whole to do with as you please. Store the dragon fruit in a sealed container in the fridge for 1-2 days."

      "title": "Slice the dragon fruit in half lengthwise.",
      "content": "Slice the dragon fruit in half lengthwise. Place the dragon fruit on a cutting board and use a sharp knife to cut it in half. If the dragon fruit is ripe, it will cut easily. Hold it firmly with one hand to ensure an even cut. [7] X Research source When a dragon fruit is ripe, the skin turns a reddish pink color that’s even in tone, and it’s often softer."

      "title": "Use a spoon to scoop the pulp out of the dragon fruit.",
      "content": "Use a spoon to scoop the pulp out of the dragon fruit. Hold one half of the dragon fruit in one hand, using the other to dig a spoon into the flesh and scrape it out. A large spoon works well to scoop out the first large clumps, while a smaller spoon will help you remove the flesh from the skin. [8] X Research source You can also use a scooper to produce perfectly round balls."

      "title": "Place the pulp in a clean bowl.",
      "content": "Place the pulp in a clean bowl. Each time you scoop out a piece of flesh, place it in a bowl big enough to hold all of the dragon fruit. You can transfer the dragon fruit to something else, such as onto a plate or into a recipe, later on. The bowl will keep the dragon fruit from getting dirty once it’s been de-skinned.

      "content": "Remove any skin still attached to the dragon fruit. If you notice patches of skin still attached to the flesh after you’ve scooped it out, you’ll need to trim them off. Use a knife to cut off any small pieces of skin so that the dragon fruit is edible. [10] X Research source The skin of a dragon fruit shouldn’t be eaten."

      "title": "Eat your pieces of dragon fruit or use them in a recipe.",
      "content": "Eat your pieces of dragon fruit or use them in a recipe. Dragon fruit shaped in little round balls from a scooper goes great in a fruit salad, or you can snack on your dragon fruit plain as it is. If you scooped out large sections at once, consider using a knife to cut them into smaller pieces. [11] X Research source Place the dragon fruit in the fridge for 1-2 days if there’s any left over. Put it in a sealed container or plastic bag to keep it as fresh as possible."
