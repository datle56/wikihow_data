House cleaning professional Raymond Chiu says the “simplest way to remove gum…is to freeze or make the sticky substance as cold as possible.” Simply add a few ice cubes into a sealable plastic bag. Then, Chiu says to “place [the ice] directly on the gum for a few minutes until the gum hardens.” [1] X Expert Source Raymond Chiu House Cleaning Professional Expert Interview. 15 October 2019.
