      "title": "Allow your Brita filter to dry out for 3 days.",
      "content": "Allow your Brita filter to dry out for 3 days. Before you can ship or drop off you water filter, you have to clean it and let it dry. To do this, simply leave the filter out in a well-ventilated area for 3 days to give it time to air dry. [1] X Research source Your filter is a closed system, so you can’t reach into it and dry it by hand. Even if you wanted to break the filter to hand dry it, there are a ton of contaminants inside the filter that you shouldn’t touch."

      "title": "Wipe away any surface dirt or grime with a clean, dry cloth.",
      "content": "Wipe away any surface dirt or grime with a clean, dry cloth. Use a clean cloth to wipe your filter down. Scrub away any surface dirt or grime to avoid contaminating any of the other recyclables at the plant. Avoid using a damp cloth to ensure that your filter stays dry. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Wrap the water filter up in a plastic grocery bag.",
      "content": "Wrap the water filter up in a plastic grocery bag. Grab a standard plastic grocery bag from under your sink or hold on to a spare bag the next time you go shopping. Take your water filter and place it in the plastic bag. Roll the excess plastic around the filter and tie the handles together to secure it. [3] X Research source If you’re recycling multiple filters, wrap them in separate plastic bags. That way, if one of the filters cracks and the contaminants spill out, you’ll still be able to recycle the other filters."

      "title": "Sign up for the Brita recycling program if you want free rewards.",
      "content": "Sign up for the Brita recycling program if you want free rewards. Go online to Brita’s website and sign up for an account by clicking the button at the top right of the screen. Enter your personal information and enroll in the Brita recycling program. Every time that TerraCycle receives a package from you, they’ll let Brita know and you’ll be awarded redeemable points. These points can be used to earn discounts on future Brita products. [4] X Research source You can visit Brita’s website and sign up for an account at https://www.brita.com/recycling-filters/ . TerraCycle is the only company that Brita has paired with to recycle their filters. This means that you won’t earn any points if you drop the filter off at a standard recycling plant. This is entirely optional. You can still ship your filters to TerraCycle if you aren’t enrolled in the program."

      "title": "Package your filter in a small box.",
      "content": "Package your filter in a small box. Get a small cardboard box or pick up a shipping box from your local post office or shipping store. Place your bagged filter in the box. You can ship multiple filters in one box if you’d like. If you do, line your filters up in the base of the box so that they’re all facing the same direction. [5] X Research source You can also take the plastic bag to a USPS, UPS, or FedEx if you live in the United States and have them package it for you. If you do this, bring your shipping label with you to the store. UPS is the only shipping store that will ship your filter for free."

      "title": "Seal the cardboard box closed with packing tape.",
      "content": "Seal the cardboard box closed with packing tape. Fold the smaller flaps of your box over into the box before folding the 2 bigger flaps on top. Hold them down while you seal the package with a long strip of packing tape. Run the tape over the seam in the middle and fold it over the sides of the box before pressing it down.

Tear 4 strips of packing tape off of the roll, placing the pieces along the edges of the label to adhere it to the box. [8] X Research source Don’t obscure the writing on the label with your tape. If the label can’t be read, the shipping company you’re using will either refuse to take it or lose it in transit. The label must be on the top of the box in a highly visible location. Don’t tape it to the corner of the box or fold it over a side."

You can take your package to another shipping company if you’d like, but you’ll have to pay a small fee to have it shipped."

      "content": "Identify the type of plastic your filter is made of by inspecting it. Take your water filter and inspect the surface to look for a number enclosed by 3 arrows arranged in a triangle. Most Brita filters are made out of #5 plastic, although different models may use a different type of plastic. You need to know what kind of plastic your filter is made out of in order to find a plant that can recycle your type of plastic. [10] X Research source"

      "content": "Call recycling plants to see if they accept your type of water filter. Starting with the plant closest to you, use the phone numbers listed online to call the recycling plants in your surrounding area. When someone answers the phone, ask them if they recycle whatever type of plastic your filter is made out of by providing them with the number. If they do, ask them if they accept water filters. [12] X Research source Even if a plant accepts your type of plastic, they may not have the ability to process water filters since filters absorb contaminants. The reverse may also be true. A plant may process #1 or #3 water filters, for example, but they may not be able to take your #5 plastic."

Most recycling plants don’t charge the public to drop off material, so you shouldn’t need to worry about paying. Simply pass the filter off to the clerk behind the desk to have it recycled.
