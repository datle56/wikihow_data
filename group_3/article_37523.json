The way your brain works, when something tense or suspenseful is going on, the brain narrows and focuses your attention on that one thing. [1] X Research source If you just shut the driver's door and locked your keys inside, you probably didn't think about anything else. Taking a walk around the car and checking all the other doors also gives you the opportunity to take a few deep breaths so you can calm down a little."

A first responder will come and open your car door for you—and they'll typically get there pretty quickly if it's an emergency situation. Don't use this option unless it genuinely is an emergency, though (running late is not an emergency). [2] X Trustworthy Source Consumer Reports Nonprofit organization dedicated to consumer advocacy and product testing Go to source The first responder might not always use the least destructive option to get into your car. If they break a window, for example, you'll be on the hook for replacing it. But if it's truly an emergency, that's a small price to pay."

If someone else in your family has a key to your car, or if you have a spare at home, call or text whoever's available to help you out. It might take them a few minutes, but they'll likely be quicker than a locksmith (and they'll definitely be cheaper). If you do have a spare key, attach it somewhere on the underside of the car with a magnetic key safe so you'll have it on hand if this happens again."

Take stock of what's around you and make note of what could be beneficial to you. Here are some ideas to help: At home : If you're at home, do you have a spare key inside the house? Even if your house key is on your key ring with your car key, it's usually easier to break into the house . At a school : Go to the office and let them know what's going on. Most schools have a courtesy officer on duty who might be able to help you out. On larger campuses, try an administrative office or the student union, or just look for campus security. At a shopping center : If there's a security guard, they'll likely be able to help you out. If not, look for a grocery store, discount store, hardware store, or pharmacy—they're your best bets to find tools that might help you. In a parking lot : If there are any other drivers around, one of them might have an emergency kit or other tools in their car that would be helpful."

Go to the top corner of your door directly over the lock and work the middle of the shoelace behind the door frame. It can take a little doing to get it wedged in there—keeping it flat will help.

Give yourself a generous amount of loop so you won't lose it in the process of trying to get it past the door seal. This can take a little bit of effort, but if you're pretty dexterous it shouldn't be too hard to get the loop and the slip knot inside the car. If you've got something you can use as a wedge, stick that in the corner between your door frame and your car to make the gap between them a little wider. That'll make it easier for you to get the knot through. If you use a wedge, take it out as soon as you get the knot through the door. You actually need the door frame and the car to be relatively tight so you can control the shoelace."

If you're in a commercial area, look for a laundromat or dry cleaners. Any other kind of retail store also might be an option. No coat hanger available? Any kind of long, bendy wire will work as long as it's stiff enough to hold its position when you bend it in place. That spiral where the hanger meets the hook can be difficult to bend open.

Be really careful if you have side airbags in your door—it's easy to accidentally deploy them. Stay perpendicular to the lock itself to avoid this. [9] X Research source"
