      "content": "Make a homemade lint roller . You will need a roll of wide, packaging tape and a rolling pin. Unroll a little bit of tape, and place the end against one of the ends of the rolling pin. Make sure that the sticky side of the tape is facing you, and the smooth side is facing the rolling pin. Carefully wrap the tape around the rolling pin in a spiral, like a candy cane, making sure to overlap each turn. When you reach the other end of the rolling pin, cut the tape off. It should hold together by itself, but it if doesn't, you can use a small piece of tape to stick it down to the pin. To use this, simply place the rolling pin on your garment. Hold it by the handles, and roll it up and down until the lint is gone."

Hold out your hand with your fingers closed together. Wrap the tape, sticky-side-out around your fingers, and overlap the edges. Lightly pat the affected area with your fingers. When the tape stops being sticky, simply rotate the tape around your fingers until the dirty side is facing you. Continue patting the garment with the fresh side of the tape."

      "content": "Use a strip of tape. Find some wide tape, and cut a piece that is a few inches long. Place the tape, sticky-side-down, onto the affected area. Make sure that the tape is going in the same direction as the weave of the fabric (usually up-and-down). Rub your finger across the tape to smooth it down, then pull it off. The wider the tape is, the more area you will cover. Try to find something that is about 2 inches (5.08 centimeters) wide."

Take a shaving razor, and place it near the top of the garment. Gently drag the razor down the fabric a few inches. Lift it off and tap off any excess lint. Continue pulling the razor down the fabric, stopping every few inches to tap the lint off. If you do not have an electric lint shaver, a more inexpensive option would be to use a single-blade razor. Hold the razor at such an angle to skim the fabric surface and get rid of the lint, but be careful not to cut into the cloth and ruin the garment."
