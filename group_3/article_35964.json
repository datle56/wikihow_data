You could ask a “would you rather” question or have them choose what they like from a list so you can get to know them better. You’ll seem really upbeat and entertaining to your match and get them really excited to talk to you! “Which vacation sounds better to you: skiing in the mountains ⛷️ relaxing on the beach 🏖️ or camping at a state park ⛺?” “If you could only eat one food for the rest of your life, what would it be? 🍕? 🍔? Maybe 🎂?” “Two truths and a lie! I’m an amazing dancer 🕺, Halloween is my favorite holiday 🎃, or I’ve never had a cavity ​​😁.”"
