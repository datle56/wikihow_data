      "content": "Exercise after consuming a lot of sugar. Acne breakouts can be caused by spikes in your insulin and blood sugar levels, which, in turn, are caused by eating a high amount of sugar (such as chocolate bars or any other sweet treat.) Therefore, to prevent large blood sugar spikes after eating chocolate, get some exercise —whether it’s a full workout routine or just a light walk around the neighborhood. [1] X Trustworthy Source American Diabetes Association Health-based nonprofit focused on preventing and researching diabetes Go to source Physical activity can lower your blood glucose (sugar) levels for up to 24 hours or more because it makes your body sensitive to insulin. Insulin is a natural hormone that regulates the amount of sugar in your blood. As you exercise and your body becomes more sensitive to insulin, it can better use any available insulin to take up the sugar in your bloodstream."

      "content": "Eat your chocolate alongside a protein or fat. Something with protein or fat in it (like a protein bar or nut butter, for example) can help slow down your digestion and, as a result, reduce the spike in blood sugar that causes breakouts on your skin. Next time you crave a bit of chocolate, consider finding a way to pair it with something else! Chocolate and peanut butter, for example, are a delicious combo—and peanut butter is high in protein.

      "content": "Try eating dark chocolate or raw cacao in the future. Milk and white chocolate are sweet and delicious, but all that sugar and milk in the chocolate are likely contributing to acne flare-ups. High-percentage dark chocolate has lower sugar content and no milk, so try that instead. Alternatively, cacao (chocolate in its raw form) doesn’t have any impact on acne, so consider having some snackable cacao nibs instead of reaching for a candy bar! [3] X Research source High-percentage dark chocolate simply means that it has more cocoa and less sugar. Cacao can be a fantastic snack if you eat it in moderation! Raw cacao contains vitamins A, C, E, and zinc, which are all good for your skin."

Eating low-glycemic foods with complex carbohydrates may reduce your risk of developing acne because those foods don’t cause a spike in your blood sugar. Additionally, foods with vitamins A and E, zinc, and antioxidants are thought to be beneficial to your skin! [4] X Research source Foods with complex carbohydrates include: Whole grains Legumes Unprocessed fruits and vegetables Foods with beneficial vitamins and nutrients include: Spinach and other dark leafy greens Yellow and orange fruits and veggies like carrots, sweet potatoes, and apricots Tomatoes Blueberries Brown rice Quinoa Pumpkin seeds Nuts Beans, peas, and lentils Turkey Fatty fish like salmon and mackerel"

Drinking water is part of a healthy lifestyle and specifically helps dilute the sugar in your blood and flush out the excess to keep your skin acne-free and clear. So, drink a glass of water whenever you have a bit of chocolate—and remember to keep drinking to get the recommended amount of daily water in your system.

      "content": "Maintain your skincare routine (or start one). If you already have a skincare routine to keep your skin hydrated and acne-free, make sure to do it on days you plan to have some chocolate. If not, consider developing a skincare routine —especially if acne is a frequent problem for you. Use a gentle facial cleanser to clean your face each day and a non-greasy face moisturizer to keep your skin hydrated without making it oily as well. [7] X Research source If you’re in the middle of an acne breakout, use an over-the-counter acne treatment in addition to a facial cleanser. It’s always important to apply sunscreen when you go outside, but if you have acne-prone skin, make sure to choose anti-acne sunscreen that won’t clog your pores."

      "content": "Follow the 80/20 rule when it comes to sweets and processed foods. It’s okay to eat chocolate if that’s your favorite sweet treat—just do so in moderation. The 80/20 rule means that roughly 80% of your diet should be foods that are nutritious and good for you, while 20% can be indulgent “junk” food—essentially, your favorite snacks, desserts, and treats that aren’t necessarily good for you. [8] X Research source Basically, you can still enjoy less-nutritious foods while being healthy and acne-free; you don’t need to cut chocolate out of your diet entirely! Just keep track of the foods you eat each day and make sure the majority of your diet is nutritious. If you do that, a piece of chocolate every now and then shouldn’t hurt. Nonetheless, always adhere to any dietary restrictions or instructions from your doctor first and foremost."

      "content": "There are conflicting studies on whether chocolate causes acne. Numerous studies have tried to determine if chocolate can actually cause acne, but results so far have been inconclusive. Some studies have hinted that chocolate may make existing acne worse or trigger new outbreaks of it.

      "content": "Cocoa itself may not cause acne, but chocolate products often do. Overindulging in chocolate products (like candy and cake) can lead to more severe acne because those products contain other ingredients that have definitively been linked to acne —specifically, milk and sugar. [11] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Therefore, while it’s unclear whether pure chocolate is harmful, a chocolate bar or slice of chocolate cake may still cause your acne to flare up. Generally, high-glycemic diets (diets that are high in quick-digesting carbohydrates and sugars) are often associated with acne. Therefore, any kind of carbohydrate-heavy and sugar-rich food—like chocolate cake, white rice, or bagels—may contribute to acne flare-ups or increase their severity. Ultimately, you don’t need to swear off chocolate entirely to stay acne-free. Just be mindful of the amount of sugar in your chocolate, eat it in moderation, and follow the tips above to prevent acne."

      "content": "Milk While cow’s milk has plenty of nutritional value—including protein, calcium, and zinc, for example—it may also cause more severe acne outbreaks. While the reason why isn’t entirely clear, some theorize that a specific bovine hormone in cow’s milk can affect your acne. [12] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Dermatology Professional organization made of over 20,000 certified dermatologists Go to source That doesn’t mean you need to cut milk out of your diet; for example, you might try buying an alternative to cow’s milk at the grocery store, like almond or cashew milk. While cow’s milk does contribute to acne, other dairy products don’t. There’s currently no evidence that products like cheese and yogurt lead to acne breakouts."

      "title": "Alcohol",
      "content": "Alcohol Alcohol doesn’t directly affect your acne, but in large amounts, it can alter your hormone levels, which in turn leads to acne breakouts. [13] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source When your hormone levels increase, your skin begins to produce sebum, a substance that can clog up your pores with oil and cause your skin to break out with acne. It’s always important to drink in moderation for your general health, but if you're also prone to acne, do your best to drink as little as possible. For example, a single glass of wine with dinner likely isn’t harmful—but a night of heavy binge drinking can really throw your hormones out of balance."

      "title": "Fast food",
      "content": "Fast food Fast food like french fries, hamburgers, and pizza is typically high in saturated fats and processed ingredients that can really raise your blood sugar levels (and throw off your hormonal balance). Therefore, if your diet has a lot of fast food, you may also experience more acne outbreaks. Try reducing the amount of fast food in your diet and make it an occasional treat rather than a regular part of your meals. [14] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Medical School Harvard Medical School's Educational Site for the Public Go to source Everyone craves fast food sometimes, so try making a homemade version of your favorite fast food snacks rather than going out and buying it. For example, try baking a batch of french fries in the oven or making a burger with white meat instead of red."
