An open D chord is bright, high-pitched, and expansive. It is one of the most commonly used chords, and works well with other common open chords like E, A, and G. [3] X Research source Remember that frets count from the head down. If you're right-handed, the first fret is all the way to your left. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Strum every string except A and low E strings. Ignore the top two thickest strings on the guitar -- they are not used for the chord and will muck up the sound."

      "content": "Know that you can move this shape up and down the neck to make other chords. This simply three-fingered shape can be slide up and down the bottom three strings to make more chords. Practice playing moving up and down the neck, searching out other chords. Note: Your ring finger determines the root of the chord. If it is on a B, then the chord is a B."

      "title": "Go to the fifth fret of the guitar.",
      "content": "Go to the fifth fret of the guitar. This is a slightly \"thicker,\" higher-pitched D chord. It is also much easier to get to when you're further down the neck, and easily transitions into other barre chords. If you already know it, this is simply an A-major barre chord located on the 5th fret, 5th string. This note is a D. [8] X Research source"

You can also place your pinkie on the 2nd string, seventh fret, your ring finger on the 3rd string, 7th fret and your middle finger on the 4th string, 7th fret. Most people find it easier to just barre the string, but you will get a cleaner sound with individual fingers. If you slid the entire thing up the neck, using open strings instead of a barred index finger, you'd have an open A chord."

      "content": "Leave the bottom string barred, or simply don't play it. The top and bottom strings are the least essential for your chord. If you can strum just the middle four strings, you'll have a better-sounding chord, but you can also strum the high-e string for a little more noise. Do not strum the top string."

Still, knowing how to form this chord is a lot of fun, and can give your songs a breath of fresh air when thrown in for a normal D. This chord is melodically identical to those before it, just at a different \"octave.\""

This is simply an E-form barre chord, [9] X Research source meaning you form an E-major chord with your pinky, ring, and middle finger, then barre two frets up with the index.
