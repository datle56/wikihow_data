      "title": "The Dutch ‘g’ is a fricative.",
      "content": "The Dutch ‘g’ is a fricative. This means that the air is moving past a partly constricted opening in your mouth. Other examples of fricatives in English are “f” as in “fee,” “s” as in “hiss,” and “th” as in “thistle.”"

    {
      "title": "This is a voiceless sound.",
      "content": "This is a voiceless sound. For an example of voiced versus voiceless sounds, pronounce the word \"zap\" in English. The 'z' is voiced. Then pronounce the word \"sap\". The \"s\" is unvoiced. All the fricatives mentioned in the previous step are voiceless, too."

      "title": "Press your tongue against the roof of your mouth.",
      "content": "Press your tongue against the roof of your mouth. This should be at the point where the uvula hangs down. The sound is similar to the ‘ch’ in ‘loch,’ but to the Dutch, that still sounds too much like a ‘k’ and in ‘cat,’ because it is made against the “velum” rather than the uvula. The Dutch sound is also found in German (e.g. in \"Dach\" = \"roof\"). To pronounce the 'g' like a native Dutch speaker, try to make a sound as if you were gargling. It may sound kind of gross, but that is generally how it's pronounced. Try saying the word ‘gek’ which means ‘crazy.’ The ‘-ek’ part is pronounced exactly the same as the ‘-eck’ part in ‘check,’ so you would get a short gurgling sound followed by ‘eck.’ Or, if you think the ‘ch’ in ‘loch’ works better for you, it would be ‘ch-eck.’"
