      "title": "You’re swiping right too much.",
      "content": "You’re swiping right too much. Tinder uses an algorithm called Elo to show your profile to other users. While Tinder isn’t super forthcoming about how their algorithm works , what we do know is that it uses your own swiping habits to determine how high you are in the queue. If you’re blindly swiping right on everyone’s profile, the algorithm is going to push you further down, meaning fewer people will see your profile. [1] X Research source Every Tinder profile has a “score” from the algorithm. Swiping right on low-quality profiles (like people with no photos and no bio) tells the algorithm that your standards are low, meaning that your profile is going to get shown to other low-quality profiles. Since profiles with no pics and empty bios are usually bots, it’s unlikely that you’ll get many matches."

      "title": "You’ve deleted and re-made your account too often.",
      "content": "You’ve deleted and re-made your account too often. You might have heard of a way to “trick” Tinder’s algorithm by deleting and re-making your account. While this does work in the short-term, doing it too often can actually lead to Tinder shadowbanning you, or not showing your profile to other users. [2] X Research source If no one can see your profile, then no one can swipe right on you. If this happens, you might also get a warning from Tinder about “inappropriate behavior,” meaning they’ve flagged your profile."

      "title": "Your location settings are too restrictive.",
      "content": "Your location settings are too restrictive. It’s no surprise that when you set your location settings to 1 mile, you’re going to get fewer matches. Try expanding your location settings to 10-20 miles so that more people pop up in your queue. If you have Tinder Gold, you can use Tinder Passport to select a specific area of the world that you’d like to see profiles from. Simply head to Settings, then hit “Location” and “Add New Location” in the app. [3] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Your age range is too low.",
      "content": "Your age range is too low. Tinder lets you pick an age range of the users that you’d like to see. While there’s no “wrong” age range, setting your range too low can limit the amount of profiles that Tinder can match you with. Try adjusting your age range so it’s roughly around your own age. That way, you’re much more likely to come across profiles that you can match with. [4] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Only swipe right on the people you want to match with.",
      "content": "Only swipe right on the people you want to match with. While it might seem like a good idea to swipe right on everyone, that can actually lower your chances of getting matches. Take your time, and look at each profile to see if they’re actually a good match for you. If they aren’t, swipe left. This will show the algorithm that you’re being more picky about your swipes, and it will push you higher in the queue so other people can see you. [5] X Research source When you match with someone, make an effort to chat with them and have a conversation . This also shows the algorithm that you’re serious about talking to people and finding a match rather than just blindly swiping. Just make sure you try to set up a time to meet in person within a few days of matching with them. For guys, the average match rate is about 1/10 . So for every 10 profiles you swipe right on, you’re likely to get 1 match."

      "title": "Super Like people.",
      "content": "Super Like people. Super Likes are the cheat code to the algorithm. When you Super Like someone , you’re telling Tinder that you really want this user to see your profile. This forces the app to ignore the algorithm and push your profile to the top of that user’s queue. [6] X Research source Every user gets 1 Super Like per day. After that, you can pay a small fee to get more Super Likes."

      "content": "Upgrade to Tinder Plus, Tinder Gold, or Tinder Platinum. It’s no secret that Tinder will bump your profile if you’re a paying customer. If you don’t mind spending a little extra dough each month, try upgrading your profile to see if you get more matches. In your Settings, select which upgrade you’d like to purchase, then enter in your payment info on the app. [7] X Research source Tinder Plus gives you unlimited likes, unlimited rewinds, and hides ads. Tinder Gold gives you all that plus 5 Super Likes per week and 1 Boost a month. Tinder Premium includes everything mentioned above plus prioritized likes and the ability to message someone before matching with them. You can cancel and go back to regular Tinder any time."

      "content": "Delete and re-make your account using a different phone number. While deleting and re-making your account too often can lead to a shadowban, Tinder tracks who is who by using your phone number or Facebook profile that you sign in with. You can get around this by re-making your account with a different phone number or Facebook profile. That way, your account will start fresh, and you don’t run the risk of getting shadowbanned. [8] X Research source Typically, you can delete and re-make your account 1 time with the same login information before Tinder will start throttling your matches."

      "content": "Switch to a different app. Maybe Tinder just isn’t the dating app for you. If you’re not having luck here, try using a different app , like Bumble , Hinge , or eHarmony. Apps like these may have different users you’ve never matched with before, and they might offer up profiles from people who are looking for more serious relationships.

      "content": "Pick photos that show off your personality. Selfies are great, but what do those pics really say about you? Instead, make a good Tinder profile by choosing photos of you in your natural habitat: out to eat with friends, taking your dog on a walk, or going on a hike. That way, potential matches will learn a little bit more about you before they’ve even read your bio. [10] X Research source Try asking family and friends to snap a few pics of you while you’re out and about. It might feel strange at first, but most people are happy to do it!"

Instead of a mirror pic with dismal, dreary lighting, choose the photo where your face is lit up by the sun. Natural lighting is the most flattering, and you’re much more likely to get right swipes that way. [11] X Research source"

Tell potential matches a little bit about yourself, but keep it short and snappy—500 characters or under is the sweet spot. Write a bio that shows off your personality and lets people know what you’re looking for, whether it be a relationship, a fling, or something else entirely.

This gives users more insights into who you are, and it also strengthens your profile. [13] X Research source Worried about creeps finding your Instagram? Don’t be—users can’t see your actual Instagram handle, just the photos that are on your page."
