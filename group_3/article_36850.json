      "content": "Apply an intensive hair treatment instead of conditioner every other wash. Apply a hair oil or cream mask to dry hair before you get in the shower. Let it sit for 3-5 minutes, then rinse and shampoo your hair. [3] X Research source Try making your own hot oil treatment with olive, coconut, or avocado oil to add deep-penetrating moisture to the hair shaft. You can also wrap your head in a towel and let the oil stay on your hair while you sleep. Rinse it out in the morning in the shower and then shampoo and style as usual. If you find oil-based products too heavy, try a cream-based hair mask from your stylist or local drug store."

      "content": "Use an at-home protein mask to nourish your hair on a budget. An at-home protein mask is a great way to deep condition your hair without spending money at a salon. You can typically find these at your local drug store, or you can purchase them online. [5] X Research source Look for products that contain the hair-healthy protein keratin. Make your own protein mask at home by mixing together 1 egg and a large spoonful of plain yogurt. Add an extra spoonful (or 2) of yogurt if you have longer than shoulder-length hair. Leave the mask on for 30 minutes, then rinse your hair with cold water, to avoid cooking the egg in your hair. Apply your protein mask every night for the first week after bleaching if your hair is especially brittle."

      "content": "Be gentle with your hair, especially when it’s wet. Your hair is especially vulnerable to breakage when it's wet, so always wait to brush or comb it until it’s completely dry. Be gentle when towel-drying your hair, too. Use a soft, microfiber towel to gently blot your hair dry, since rubbing or squeezing your hair can cause it to break. If you don't have a soft towel, try drying your hair with an old T-shirt instead!"

      "content": "Cut off as much of the damaged ends as possible. Ask your stylist to trim off your split ends. If you hair is breaking off in the middle, try getting your haircut in a style that seamlessly incorporates the length of the broken-off pieces. [6] X Research source Split ends are when the end of the hair shaft divided into multiple, smaller hairs. This can travel all the way down to your scalp, resulting in damaged, frizzy hair. Cutting the ends prevents the damage from moving down the shaft. If you don’t want to do a drastic cut right away, have your stylist cut off about 1 ⁄ 4 inch (0.64 cm) and then get your hair trimmed every month or so, taking off more and more of the damaged bits every time."

Protein will help make your hair stronger and less likely to break off. The most intensive protein treatments are applied at professional salons. Talk to your hairstylist about what type would be best for your hair. The sooner you have the treatment done, the more breakage and damage you can prevent. Most hair salons have different strength treatments and formulas for various purposes. Even after your first intensive treatment, you can continue to get protein and/or moisture treatments every few months to keep your hair healthy. Discuss the perfect plan with your hair stylist. Too much protein can harden your hair and damage it instead of restoring it. [8] X Expert Source Christine George Master Hair Stylist & Colorist Expert Interview. 10 January 2020."

      "title": "Shampoo your hair 1-2 times a week.",
      "content": "Shampoo your hair 1-2 times a week. Shampoo strips your hair of natural oils that keep it healthy. Since bleached hair naturally has less oil, you should wash it less. Aim to shampoo your hair once per week if possible. [10] X Research source If shampooing once per week is not enough, try slowly cutting down to about 2-3 times per week instead. You can also try using dry shampoo in between your shampoo days, to help keep your hair clean and fresh. Avoid shampoos containing sulfates, which will further dry out your hair. Try using a cleansing conditioner instead of shampoo to gently clean and nourish your hair. Ask your hairstylist for a recommendation. You can switch over entirely to a cleansing conditioner or use a sulfate-free shampoo and cleansing conditioner interchangeably."
