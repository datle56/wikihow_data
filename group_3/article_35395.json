      "content": "Look for pimples, boils , or areas of red, swollen skin. Skin infections are the most common type of staph infection. They look like pimples, boils, blisters, or areas of swollen, red skin that feels hot. Sometimes, they ooze pus or other discharge.

Washing your hands frequently and keeping wounds clean are the best ways to prevent a skin staph infection."

      "title": "Check for abscesses, or pockets of pus.",
      "content": "Check for abscesses , or pockets of pus. Abscesses are swollen pockets of skin that are filled with pus. They feel like they’re filled with liquid, rather than a lump of swollen skin, and it usually hurts to touch them. Abscesses that grow increasingly painful and pus seeping from a wound could indicate a bad infection, so call your doctor if you notice these signs. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Wash your hands",
      "content": "Wash your hands before and after touching the area. Wash up thoroughly with soap and hot water before you clean the area or change a bandage. You wouldn't want to risk contaminating it further. After treating the infected skin, wash your hands again to prevent spreading germs. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Soak a minor infection 3 times per day and keep it bandaged.",
      "content": "Soak a minor infection 3 times per day and keep it bandaged. Minor abscesses and skin infections often go away on their own with proper home care. Wash the infected area thoroughly, soak it in warm water for 10 minutes 3 times a day, and cover it with a sterile bandage. Change the bandage 2 to 3 times daily or whenever it gets wet. [5] X Research source If you’d like, you can add salt to your warm water soaks. Try soaking the infected area in a solution of 1 tablespoon (14.8 ml) of salt and 1 US quart (0.95 L) of warm water. Adding salt to your warm water soaks can help soothe your skin. While salt doesn't kill staph bacteria, it could help deter other contaminants."

      "content": "Don't attempt to drain an abscess on your own. Avoid touching an infection unless you’re treating it. Remember to wash your hands before and after providing treatment. If you have an abscess, leave it alone and don't try to drain or pop it. [6] X Research source Scratching an infection or popping an abscess could further contaminate the area and spread germs."

However, if pain, swelling, or abscesses get worse, or if you have a fever, you should see your doctor as soon as possible.

      "content": "See your doctor if you think you might have septic arthritis. Septic arthritis is a joint infection often caused by staph bacteria. Schedule an appointment with your doctor if you experience symptoms such as intense joint pain, redness, swelling, and fever. Infections typically occur in the knees, ankles, or toes and, usually, only one joint is affected. [10] X Trustworthy Source MedlinePlus Collection of medical information sourced from the US National Library of Medicine Go to source Symptoms of septic arthritis develop suddenly. In other forms of arthritis, joint pain and swelling develop gradually, often occur at distinct times during the day, and typically affect more than one joint. Your doctor will perform an examination and take a bacterial culture. They’ll aspirate the joint, or remove excess fluid to decrease swelling. If they determine you have an infection, they’ll inject medication into the joint or prescribe oral antibiotics. [11] X Research source"
