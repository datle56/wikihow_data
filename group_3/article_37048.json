      "content": "Use locking pliers to lock the door in place. Locking pliers are small, handheld vice-grips. Pick up 2 of them from the home improvement store. Use their jaws to secure the bottom of the door to the roller track, then try to move the door. When it won’t move at all, you’ll know it’s in place. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Tie extension springs to the tracks with safety cables.",
      "content": "Tie extension springs to the tracks with safety cables. Extension springs hang loosely on the sides of the door. Wrap a strong cord around the track and the spring to bind them together. Make sure the rope is securely knotted so that the springs won’t turn into dangerous whips if the cable they’re on breaks. [3] X Research source If you don’t see these springs, look above your door for a tightly-wound torsion spring. This spring is a safer lifting mechanism than extension springs as long as you don’t mess with the tension. Leave it alone and call a professional to release the spring."

      "title": "Detach the lifting cable from the bottom bracket.",
      "content": "Detach the lifting cable from the bottom bracket. Now that you’ve secured the door, locate the thick lifting cable on either side of the door. Use pliers to pull the cable free from the bracket on the lowest door panel. The door panel is still attached to the rest of the door, so don’t worry about it falling. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Lower the door.",
      "content": "Lower the door. Stand off to the side of the door. Pull it all the way down, resting the bottom of the door on the floor. These doors are heavy, so you may need a few helpers to pull down a double door. It’s a good idea to place a block of wood or another sturdy substance to prevent the bottom of the door from crashing down on someone’s finger or toe."

      "content": "Take apart the door panels by removing the rollers and brackets. Start with the highest panel and have others hold the panel in place as you work. You’ll need to unscrew the hinges securing the panel to the one below it. Also undo the brackets holding the rollers in place on the side of that panel. When finished, move the panel away, then work on the next panel. If your door has windows, tape over the door to prevent shards from flying in case of shattering."

Also make sure that the bottom of the door is as level with the ground as possible to achieve the perfect installation. [7] X Research source You can place shims on the floor to lift up an uneven side of the door. The rubber weather stripping will fill in the gaps on uneven floors as long as you keep the door panels straight during installation."

Feed a steel cable through the pulleys, hooking the end to a bracket on the back of the curved part of the track. You will need to loop the free end of the cable through a small bracket. Add an S-hook to the bracket, then place the S-hook on the track above the door. You will also need to run a safety cable through the extension springs and loop the cables through the holes in the track’s brackets."
