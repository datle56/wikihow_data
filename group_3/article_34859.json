If you're just doing 2 braids, you can start each one just behind your ears. To braid the hair, divide it into 3 sections, a left, middle, and right section. Bring the right over the middle, making it the middle section. Bring the left over the middle, making it the middle section. Continue alternating back and forth until you've braided the hair all the way down. Secure it with a small hair tie. You're going to be wrapping the braids around your head, and loose braids will make this process easier. If you braid it too tightly, it may create lumps under the wig."

Continue wrapping the braid up and toward the front of your head until the whole braid is resting against your scalp. However, stop wrapping a few finger-lengths away from the front of your scalp so the braid won't show under the front of the wig. Once the entire braid is wrapped, add bobby pins all around the braid until it stays in place. [3] X Research source Try to keep the braid as close to your head as possible. If you have 4 braids, start with one of the back braids first."

Take the other braid in the back and wrap it the other direction, placing it just underneath the first braid. Pin it in place with bobby pins as you go, finishing the wrap around the front, just like the other braid. Don't overlap braids, as that will create lumps. If you have 4 braids, wrap the other braids around your hair where they will fit and pin them in place. You can also use hair pins instead of bobby pins, which may help if you are having trouble getting your hair to stay in place, as they are a bit larger than bobby pins."
