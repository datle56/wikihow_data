Put your hand through the elastic band so it’s wrapped around your palm. Position the band so it’s in the crook of your hand between your thumb and index finger. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Instruct 2 people to face each other while standing 4 ft (1.2 m) apart. Recruit 2 friends, or look for 2 volunteers in the audience or on the street to help you perform your magic trick. See if there are any people who are in a relationship or are related in some way so you can use their “bond” as an explanation for the trick. Ask the participants to stand on opposite sides of you so they’re about 4–5 feet (1.2–1.5 m) apart from one another. [2] X Research source Or, just choose 2 strangers if people watching you don’t know one another."

Have the other participant keep their eyes open. Ask the person with their eyes closed if they can see anything at all to confirm that their eyes are closed. Or, use a blindfold on the person who has their eyes closed if you want to be absolutely certain they cannot see."

Move one hand on either side of their face, without touching them. [4] X Research source Wiggle your fingers so it looks like you’re “sensing their energy” so you can perform the trick. This is the “setup action” of the trick, and helps with the illusion. You’ll do the same action with the other person in a moment, but with one important difference!"

      "content": "Slip a finger between your palm and the elastic band to stretch it out. Now, move your hands to the face of the person with their eyes closed, without touching them. As you do, slide the index finger on your opposite hand under the elastic band to stretch it between your hands. Once you have the elastic band on your finger, pull your hands 4–5 inches (10–13 cm) apart to stretch it out. [5] X Research source Be sneaky when you do this! Do it quickly, and when you’re turned slightly away from the first person, so they don’t see."

Move your hands around the face of the person with their eyes closed, but don’t let the elastic touch them just yet. Then, with the elastic pulled tight, hold your hands on either side of the first person’s face. Lightly move your hands downwards in front of the person’s face so the edge of the elastic band grazes the tip of their nose. [6] X Research source Be sure to stay fluid and deliberate with your motion so it looks natural. At the end of your movement, make fists with your hands, but leave the elastic around your palm."

Hold the edge of the playing card and slowly run it down the tip of the second person’s nose. When you’re finished, put the playing card back in your pocket. [7] X Research source Lightly touch the end of the playing card against their nose so you don’t accidentally give them a papercut. Or, use an index card, a credit card, or anything else with a thin edge that’ll make a similar sensation as the elastic band."

Then, ask if the person felt anything while they had their eyes closed. When they say they felt someone touch them, ask them where they felt it. The person who had their eyes closed will say their nose because they felt the elastic. The audience can’t see the elastic, so they’ll think the person with their eyes closed felt something when you touched the second person’s nose with the card. [8] X Research source Make sure that you thank your volunteers for helping you before they sit back down."

Ideally, find 2 friends, siblings, or anyone with some sort of relationship, which can help explain the “bond” and adds to the illusion. Ask them to face each other, standing a little apart and with their hands at their sides, and position yourself between them, but don’t block their view of each other."

      "content": "Ask Person A to close their eyes, then subtly tap their hand. This is where the trick happens. Ask one of your participants to close their eyes, and to confirm that they can’t see anything. Then, turn toward Person B. As you turn, subtly but firmly tap the back of Person A’s hand with your nearest hand. Make it slick, and don’t let Person B—or the rest of the audience—see. To help, keep gesturing with your free hand and talking to keep the audience distracted. Being a good mentalist means keeping your audience’s attention where you want it! It helps if you sort of “hover” around Person A. Wave your hands around their body to demonstrate that there aren’t any wires or hidden threads, and as you do, touch their hand."

Take it in your hand and, with great concentration, tap their hand hard in about the same spot you tapped Person A’s hand. Remember, it’s all about showmanship—keep talking, and make it a big deal. If you give them lots of instructions, says mentalist Christophe Fox, they’ll be more distracted, but also more comfortable, and the trick will work better. For example, say, “Now, focus on where I’m about to touch you, but don’t say anything. Try to communicate it to your friend using only your mind.” You might pitch the trick as though you’re helping these 2 people read each others’ minds ."

      "content": "Ask Person A if they felt anything. Tell Person A to open their eyes. Then, ask them if they felt anything. They’ll say they felt a tap on their hand, and everyone else will be astonished! Of course, they felt the tap earlier, while you were setting up the trick, but they’re only reporting it now, once you’ve asked. This is called “dual reality”—you touched both people, but the audience believes you only touched 1, and it’s what the audience believes that matters. [9] X Research source This version of the trick is a little less effective, since Person A will probably spill the beans. We suggest you get out of there or move on to the next trick before they have a chance to talk to each other about it."
