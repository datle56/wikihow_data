      "content": "Begin pruning in late winter or early spring the first year after planting. Select about five main stems angled away from the center to keep, removing the others from the base. With a good pair of pruning shears angled at about 45 degrees, clip the side shoots of the remaining stems to about 15 to 20 centimetres (5.9 to 7.9 in), just above a bud.

      "content": "Prune selectively until the bush reaches maturity. Half of the new growth (marked by lighter-colored shoots) of the main stems should be trimmed the first two years after planting. [2] X Research source By the third year after planting, the bush will have established its core framework with an even distribution of stems aged between 1 and 3 years. As the plant ages, you'll want to cut away stems more than 3 years old each year. [3] X Research source Remove any shoots leading to the center of the plant and shorten any crossing or downward-facing leaders to about 5 to 8 centimetres (2.0 to 3.1 in). [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Prune in winter to encourage good growth in spring and summer. The best time to prune a mature gooseberry bush is in late winter or early spring when the plant is dormant, just before the vigorous growth of spring when healing will be quick. [6] X Research source You may wish to delay pruning until after the buds open, because the thorny thicket of an unpruned bush will be more of a deterrent to birds that feed on buds. [7] X Research source Prune hard where the bush is growing weakest; it will respond in the spring and summer with stronger growth. [8] X Research source You may wish to wear gloves to protect yourself from the plant’s vicious thorns! [9] X Research source Regular pruning shears are sufficient for most gooseberry pruning, but you may need a pair of loppers for old wood and larger, mature branches. [10] X Research source"

      "content": "Prune out crossing branches. Branches that rub together may lead to cankers and diseases, and lower branches will be deprived of sufficient sunlight. Usually it’s best to remove the lower branch or the older of the two crossing branches. [13] X Research source"

Remove diseased or damaged branches at the point where they meet their parent branch. [14] X Research source Diseased wood is marked by broken bark and rough, raised areas. Sterilize your pruning shears if you have been cutting diseased wood to avoid infecting other plants. Dead wood is brittle and has no buds. Damaged branches are missing bark where they have rubbed other branches. [15] X Research source"

      "content": "Prune out any branches that are more than 3 years old. The best fruit comes from branches that are 2 and 3 years old, and therefore older branches should be cut to renew the plant. [16] X Research source Older branches are thicker, darker in color, and may have slightly peeling bark. Gooseberry is typically grown as a “stool,” a bunch of stems arising from the ground, with old shoots regularly cut to the base. [17] X Research source"

      "title": "Reduce side shoots to 2 or 3 buds to maximize fruit production.",
      "content": "Reduce side shoots to 2 or 3 buds to maximize fruit production. Because the gooseberry produces fruit at the base of the previous year’s side shoots, or on spurs on old wood or a main branch, it’s best to trim the shoots to two or three buds to maximize the plant’s energy directed to these buds. [18] X Research source Make the cut above the bud at a slant to channel water away and avoid rotting the bud. [19] X Research source Don’t cut too close to the bud, or it may die. Trim the side shoot to 2 buds if you want larger berries. [20] X Research source"

[21] X Research source The natural tendency of the gooseberry is to be a bit sprawling and droopy; you want to counteract that.

A gooseberry that is open at the center, in the shape of a goblet or bowl, will be well exposed to light and air, less vulnerable to mildew and nesting pests, and easy to pick.
