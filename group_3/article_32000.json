      "content": "Your fear might not be what you think it is. For example, while you may hate going to the dentist, it might be the use of needles that you're truly afraid of. In this case, you'd want to focus on your fear of needles, not the dentist. If you're having trouble pinpointing your phobia, write down a list of the things that scare you. You may be able to isolate the true fear."

Write down a variety of goals at different levels. Having small achievements will help you work towards tougher aims. The act of writing down your goals can actually help you succeed. You're more likely to write down detailed, achievable goals, rather than vague ones. You'll also be more committed to sticking with them. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "It's naive to assume that you won't encounter any obstacles. Instead, imagine how you want to react to what frightens you. You could visualize something else, face the fear head-on for a set amount of time, or you could distract yourself by doing an activity. Realize that your coping strategy should change as you encounter and achieve goals. While you might initially cope by distracting yourself, you may eventually be able to face your phobia for small periods of time. Reader Poll: We asked 750 wikiHow readers how they navigate public spaces with escalators, and 57% of them said they take an elevator or the stairs instead. [Take Poll] This is a perfectly valid way to cope with a fear of escalators."

For example: [2] X Trustworthy Source HelpGuide Nonprofit organization dedicated to providing free, evidence-based mental health and wellness resources. Go to source It is normal to feel anxious if you look down from a skyscraper. On the other hand, turning down a dream job just because it happens to be at the top of a skyscraper, is not helping you achieve your goals/dreams. Many people feel anxious about getting shots or having blood drawn. Shots can be painful. It is when someone starts to avoid medical examinations and treatments just because he or she might get a shot, that the fear becomes problematic."

      "content": "This technique helps you face your fear in gradual steps. Start by writing down situations where you encounter your phobia. Be as detailed as possible and include all types of experiences, from the mildly anxious to the terrifying. This will help you tackle your fear at a variety of levels. [3] X Research source Then, rank your situations in order of how scary they are, and imagine the first (least scary) item on your list. [4] X Research source Gradually work your way through your list, letting yourself think about each scenario. Then, try seeking out these situations in real life. As you continue to face your fears, reward yourself for a job well done. [5] X Research source Try to work on a relaxation technique that can be done anywhere at anytime. This way, when you encounter your phobia, you can overcome your fear. Don't be afraid to ask someone for help if you find yourself stuck, or unable to work through an item on your list. They may be able to help you work through your fear."

Bad fortune-telling and catastrophizing both involve assuming the worst, over-generalizing involves associating everything with one bad experience. Here are a few examples. [6] X Trustworthy Source HelpGuide Nonprofit organization dedicated to providing free, evidence-based mental health and wellness resources. Go to source Bad fortune-telling: Telling yourself that the bridge will collapse when you cross it, the elevator will fall when you get on it, or that you will stutter and freak out when making your speech. Over-generalizing: Worrying that every dog will try to bite you because a certain poodle did that once to you when you were a kid. Catastrophizing: Taking simple events, such as someone coughing, and imagining the worst possible scenario—such as the person having the swine flu, and you contracting it.

      "content": "Contradicting your negative thoughts makes them less credible. For example, if you are afraid of dogs, try to remember a time when you encountered a dog, and things did not go badly. Think of all your friends who have dogs, and the nice experiences they've had. You might also try to tell yourself: That dog has a leash, and the owner is holding tightly onto the leash. The dog is very small. I can easily outrun it if it does try to chase me. The dog is playing with people and other dogs. He is unlikely to be aggressive."

Does the dog really appear aggressive? Is it growling, or wagging its tail? Ask yourself if you are fortunetelling, over-generalizing, or catastrophizing. This does not mean that you should abandon a rational fear. If that bridge really does not look safe (it is rotting and molding, there are planks missing, and the ropes or fraying), then yes, it would probably be wise to avoid that bridge."

For instance, if you are afraid of flying, try talking to yourself as you would to a friend who is afraid of flying. What would you say to reassure your friend? You might say any of the following things: The ratio between successful plane flights and plane accidents is very high. That plane has a very high safety record. There have been no accidents recorded on that type of plane. The pilot and co-pilot are very experienced. Everyone was checked thoroughly before boarding the plane. There is no way someone could have brought on a weapon or a dangerous substance. I've heard of many survivor stories from plane crashes."

Add a few drops of essential oil into your bath. Consider making some homemade bath products using essential oil.
