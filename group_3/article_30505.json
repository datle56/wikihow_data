Bumble does have paid tiers, but the most important features of the app, include the ability to swipe right (to show interest) or left (to pass), filter by basic preferences, and exchange messages are completely free . Matching comes down to one thing—you've both swiped right on each other's profiles. Despite many rumors that men must pay to use or make matches on Bumble, it's not true! Bumble is free for men, women, and users of any gender."

Depending on how busy of an area you live in and how serious you are about finding the right match on Bumble, either of the paid tiers might be worth an upgrade. Bumble Boost comes with 5 SuperSwipes per week, one Spotlight per week (to give your profile a boost), unlimited match extensions, unlimited swipes, and the ability to undo an accidental left swipe.

If you see a profile you like, swiping right is the first step in making a match . If you swipe left , that means you aren't interested in the person, and you'll advance to the next person in your queue. Swiping right does not notify the person that you liked them. They won't find out you like them until they also swipe right on you, or they subscribe to Bumble Premium, where you'll appear on their Beeline. If you want the person to know you like them right away, you can SuperSwipe them . You can buy individual SuperSwipes or subscribe to Bumble Boost or Bumble Premium to receive 5 SuperSwipes per week.

If the person swipes left on your profile, you will not get a match. You also won't be notified about any left swipes on your profile. Don't be discouraged if nothing happens when you swipe right on someone. It's possible that the person you swiped on just hasn't come across your profile yet."
