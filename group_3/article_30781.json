      "content": "Chop your almond bark into small pieces. It is easier to melt almond bark when it has been cut into smaller pieces. If your almond bark came in small disks, as it sometimes does, you do not need to chop it up. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Place the almond bark in the top part of the double boiler.",
      "content": "Place the almond bark in the top part of the double boiler. A double boiler is made up of two components--a large pan filled with water and another, smaller pan that sits on top. Double boilers help to ensure that your chocolate does not burn while you are melting it because you are heating it indirectly through the use of both pans. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Stir the almond bark constantly.",
      "content": "Stir the almond bark constantly. The bark will begin to melt almost instantly. Stir it to keep the bark from burning. When all of the chunks are melted, turn the heat off and remove the top pan from the lower one."

      "title": "Cut your almond bark into small chunks.",
      "content": "Cut your almond bark into small chunks. As stated above, smaller chunks of almond bark will melt more quickly. If your almond bark is already in small pieces, there is no need to chop it up."

      "content": "Heat the bark for 30 seconds. When the time is up, take the bowl out (be careful, it may be hot), stir the bark, and then put it back in the microwave. Continue to heat the bark in 15 second increments, taking it out and stirring each time. The reason you need to heat it at such small increments is because almond bark burns easily.
