      "content": "Establish your payment terms. An important part of setting up a billing system, regardless of how you track payments, is to make clear your standard payment terms. If you don't have payment terms, customers will not know when their payments are due and will rely on you to remind them (often many times) before they will pay. Set up terms for how many days the customer has after a sale is made to pay for that sale. For example, many businesses choose to make payment due within 15 or 30 days of the sale. You can also establish different payment lengths for different customers. Just make sure to include these terms in your contracts with them. Take into account how customers and your supply partners might like to pay their bills to you. Consider discussing your new or modified billing system with them to ensure their cooperation in using it. Whatever payment terms you choose, just be sure that you are consistent in applying them.

Your policy should specify initial steps in handling late payments, such as sending a gentle reminder a few days after a due date if the payment has not been made. From here, you should specify more intense actions that will be taken if payments continue to go unpaid 30, 60, and 90 days out. For example, you can suspend shipments or service to customers with bills that are over 30 days late. Your policy should also specify a maximum number of late days allowed before legal action will be taken. [6] X Research source"
