      "content": "Plant the sod in the spring or summer. St. Augustine grass is a warm-weather plant, so it is sold in spring and summer. Either season works well, but avoid waiting until the last days of summer. Plan on preparing your lawn and laying sod at least 90 days before you expect the first bout of frost in your area.

      "content": "Spray a glyphosate weed killer over the planting area. Follow the manufacturer’s instructions to apply the product. It’s best to wait for a dry day without much wind. Spraying glyphosate before tilling eliminates competitors that can ruin the St. Augustine grass, including other types of grass. Wear protective clothing such as gloves, long sleeves, and a facemask. Keep pets and other people away until you are finished."

      "title": "Let the glyphosate soak in undisturbed for 2 weeks.",
      "content": "Let the glyphosate soak in undisturbed for 2 weeks. After 2 weeks, the glyphosate will have done its work. Don’t worry, this does not poison your soil. You can also cover the soil with a tarp from a home improvement store to ensure nothing else grows there, although this shouldn’t be necessary. You do not have to remove the old plant matter. Let it stay there. When you till the soil later, it serves as a natural fertilizer."

      "content": "Till the ground between 4 and 6 inches (10 and 15 cm) deep. If you intend on planting the sod in a small area, you can turn over the soil with a shovel. For larger areas, use a rototiller to get it done quickly. Set the rototiller to the appropriate depth, then push it back and forth over the entire area at least once. [2] X Research source Save money by renting a rototiller. Many home improvement stores have models available you can take home for a day."

      "content": "Rake the ground smooth. After tilling, go back over the planting area with a rake. Use it to remove any debris the tiller unearthed, such as rocks and roots. Brush soil into any holes you find. Get the area as flat as possible for your grass. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Lay a line of sod along the edge of the planting area. Sod comes in both rolls and smaller squares, both of which are planted the same way. Start on one side of the yard. Unfurl the roll or place squares until you reach the other side of the yard. Keep the sod in an straight line as you go. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Continue laying sod until the yard is covered. Place more sod next to your first line. Push the sod as close together as possible. Then, continue putting down sod until you reach the other end of the yard again. Simply continue doing this until you cover the entire area. [5] X Research source If you use smaller squares of sod, stagger the rows. Do this by laying the squares so the ends don’t line up with one another. It’s like laying bricks. Avoid stepping on sod you have already laid. Kneel or walk on plywood instead."

      "content": "Water the sod immediately with 1 in (2.5 cm) of water. Use a hose or sprinklers to water the sod. Give it enough water to dampen the first 1 in (2.5 cm) of soil. This helps the grass settle into the ground, but avoid using too much water. [7] X Research source The water should not pool on top of the sod or run off of it."

After this, water the grass less frequently until it is fully established in the planting area. [8] X Trustworthy Source EDIS Electronic database of the University of Florida Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences's peer-reviewed articles Go to source After the first 7 or so days, add 1 ⁄ 2 to 1 ⁄ 4 in (1.27 to 0.64 cm) 2 to 3 times a week. The soil should finish rooting in 3 to 4 weeks. Check the water depth by digging into wet soil away from the grass or by estimation. The water should never linger on the soil or run off the grass. You do not need to water the lawn on rainy days. Let nature take care of it for you."

Use your lawnmower on a higher setting to avoid damaging the grass. You may keep the grass slightly longer or shorter, but don’t let it get out of hand. [9] X Research source"

      "content": "Water the grass when it begins folding up and turning blue. St. Augustine grass takes care of itself for the most part, but you still need to keep an eye on it. Look for signs of drought, particularly in the summer. The grass blades roll up or fold over. They also begin to dull, turning a blue-green color.

      "content": "Apply an insecticide to combat bug infestations. Chinch bugs and white grubs are common problems with St. Augustine grass. When you see brown patches of grass spread across your lawn, this is the reason. Spray a good insecticide over the grass to protect it. To check for chinch bugs, try a water test. Cut the end off a can, place it on top of the grass, then fill it with water. The bugs will float to the surface."
