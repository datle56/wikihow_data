      "content": "Find people to play with you. You only need two people to play this game, but it can be more fun and challenging if there are multiple people hiding. One person will be the seeker. All other players will hide. Consider the ages of the other players. Unless there is an adult keeping an eye on things, you might not want a blindfolded toddler running around as the seeker. Hide and Go Seek might be better for a player under 6 years old. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Choose somewhere safe to play.",
      "content": "Choose somewhere safe to play. Because the seeker is blindfolded, it's important to choose a place where they won't easily get hurt. Try not to play near a busy street, traffic, or a steep drop-off if you're playing outside. If you're playing inside, make sure you lock doors that lead to stairways. Set the boundaries. If you don't want anyone to go in certain areas--like your parent's room, upstairs, or the basement--make sure everyone knows and agrees to stay out of these areas. Decide if it's okay for people to hide in things, like dressers or closets."

      "content": "Blindfold the seeker and have he or she spin in a circle while counting to ten. You can use a scarf or bandana or any scrap of fabric as a blindfold. The spinning will disorient the seeker so she doesn't know which direction she is facing or what obstacles are in her way. If you don't have a blindfold, the seeker can just close their eyes. Just make sure she doesn't peek! The seeker can count anywhere from 10 to 100. If people need more time to hide, try counting to 25 or 50. [3] X Research source"

[4] X Research source Try and keep quiet as you find your spot, though the seeker will have a hard time figuring out which direction you went since she'll be spinning. You may change your hiding place at any time, but if you're noisy you may get caught!"

If you are the seeker, use your hands to guide you so you don't bump into anything, and listen carefully. Players may be breathing heavily after running to find their hiding spot and this may lead you in their direction."

Don't waste your claps! You only have three chances, so try not to use them all right away or one right after the other. Pay attention to other cues--breathing, giggling, creaking floorboards--to help you find the other players. The players who are hiding can change hiding places. Just be aware of how much noise you are making!"

The game ends once the seeker catches someone who is hiding, and that person becomes \"it.\" If the seeker uses all her claps and can't find anyone, she may give up and call the signal that the game is over, usually \"Olly, Olly, Oxen Free!\" You may want to use a timer so the game doesn't go on too long and become boring. If the seeker doesn't find anyone, she must take another turn as the seeker. [5] X Research source But if someone else wants a turn, it's okay to switch. It may be frustrating to the seeker if she never finds anyone!"
