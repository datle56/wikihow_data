The Department of Transportation (DOT) code is a special number given to tires and provides information that includes how old the tire is and where it was manufactured. Look around the rim of your tire for the code. The code will start with the letters DOT. [1] X Research source"

The first two digits identify the week while the last two digits identify the year. This applies to all tires made after the year 2000. [2] X Research source For example, if your DOT code is “DOT X5DR GG1U2214” that would mean that your tire was created in the 22nd week of 2014, or the last week in May 2014."

      "content": "Read the code's last three digits if the tires were made before 2000. While most tires you deal with will probably be manufactured after 2000, there are some rare circumstances, such as vintage cars, where the tires may have been manufactured before the year 2000. In this case, there will only be three digits at the end of the DOT code. The first two digits are the week in which the tires were created and the last digit is the year. [3] X Research source If the DOT code for the tire is “DOT Z3FF N0R319” it would mean that the tire was created in the 31st week of 1999, 1989, or 1979. Tires made in the 1990's will have a small triangle after the date code. [4] X Research source If you have antique tires, you may have to contact the manufacturer to determine how old they are. Do not drive on tires that are over 10 years old."

One side of the tire will usually have an abbreviated DOT code while the other side of the tire will have the full DOT code. If the entire code isn't written on the side that you're looking at, find the complete DOT code on the other side of the tire. [5] X Research source"

The sell by, use by, and expiration dates helps the store know how long they should keep a product on the shelves and is an estimate of how long the food will taste its best. These dates will usually be formatted with the month, day, and year. The date can be in a traditional numeric format or written out. Food may still be good to eat after the sell by or use by dates. [6] X Trustworthy Source Food Safety and Inspection Service of the USDA Food safety information provided by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Go to source For example, the sell by date could read something like “Sell by May 24, 2017,” or “Use by 5/24/2017.” If you find a product that is past the sell by or use by dates, you should let an employee in the store know about it."

While most food will have clearly identifiable labels for the manufacture and sell by dates, other foods like canned food and ready-to-eat meals may be labeled with a 5-digit code that signifies when the food was manufactured. Look on the bottom or sides of the meal and find a string of five numbers in a row. The first two numbers stand for the year, while the last three numbers represent the day of the year. [9] X Research source For example, if the code was 11322, you would know that the food was manufactured on the 322 day of 2011, or November 22nd, 2011."

For example, 001 would be January 1st while 365 would be December 31st. Perishable foods like eggs and milk have a 3-digit code because the food will go bad in under a year. You can assume that the food was manufactured the same year that you bought it. [10] X Research source"
