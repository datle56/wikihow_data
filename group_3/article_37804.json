Swap the positions of your front tires so the left tire is on the right side and vice-versa. Then, switch the sides of the rear tires. [5] X Research source If you have staggered directional tires, you won’t be able to properly rotate your tires unless you remove them from the rim and switch the sides they’re on. If you aren’t able to remove the tires, then take your vehicle into a mechanic to see if you need to replace them ."

On a front wheel drive vehicle, move the rear left and rear right tires to the front right and front left respectively. Bring the front left tire straight back to the rear left side. Use your spare tire for the rear right side. Take the front right tire and store it as your spare. [6] X Research source If you have a rear wheel drive or all wheel drive vehicle, then move the back right tire to the front right and the rear left tire to the front left. Move the front right tire to the back left. Use your spare tire for the rear right side. Keep the old front left tire as your new spare."

Turn each of the lug nuts counter-clockwise until they’re looser and easier to turn. [8] X Research source If the place where you parked isn’t level, block the tires with wheel chocks to keep your vehicle from rolling. Don’t remove the lug nuts completely yet since the tires could slip off your vehicle and cause damage. If you need to remove a stuck tire , try knocking it loose by tapping a piece of scrap wood against the side of the tire with a hammer."

Place a car jack against the frame and lift up your vehicle . Position the jack stands underneath your vehicle's frame, and lower the jack back down. Use a total of 4 jack stands so you have one next to each tire. [9] X Research source Check your vehicle’s manual to find the proper jack points if you have trouble finding them on your own. Avoid trying to rotate your tires while your vehicle is on the jack since it could easily slip off, which could lead to damage or injury."

Adjust your wrench to the proper torque, and turn one of the lug nuts until you hear the wrench click. Find the nut directly across from the first one and tighten it. Then, tighten the nut that’s right next to the first one. Keep working back and forth between the lug nuts until they’re all tight. [14] X Research source Each vehicle has different torque requirements, so check the manual to know what you need."

      "content": "Even tread wear If you keep your tires in the same spot the entire time, the backs of the treads will wear away faster than the fronts, which could make them uneven. When you change the tire positions, the wear and tear occur on the opposite sides of the tires so the treads maintain a consistent depth. [15] X Research source Rotate your tires every 5,000–8,000 miles (8,000–12,900 km) to prevent uneven wear."
