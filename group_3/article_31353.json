      "content": "“No harm, no foul” originated from the rules of streetball. Streetball is similar to basketball and was frequently played in the 1950s. In streetball, if there was no physical harm done to a player, then there would be no foul called. A foul in this case, is an invalid or illegal action done by a player that would result in a penalty. [2] X Research source So, if one player shoved another, but the shoved player suffered no injuries, no foul would be called regardless of if it was accidental or on purpose. [3] X Research source"

To let them know everything is okay, and that there’s no real damage, you might say “No harm, no foul.” Your friend: “Oh no, I just realized I got you the wrong coffee! Ah! I’m so sorry.” You: “No harm, no foul! I’m just happy to have a coffee to wake me up!”"

If after telling a joke that rubs you the wrong way, your friend shows a lot of concern over hurting your feelings, you might say “Hey, no harm, no foul” to let them know that it’s okay and you’re not upset with them. Your friend: “Your hair kind of makes you look like Dora the Explorer today.” You: “Really? I thought it looked kind of nice.” Your friend: “Oh! I didn’t mean to hurt your feelings. It really does look nice. Are you upset?” You: “No, no. No harm, no foul. It was just a silly joke.”"

      "content": "Use “no harm, no foul” in a legal context. This expression can also refer to acts of misconduct or illegal behaviors where no one gets hurt. In a “no harm, no foul” situation, no legal action can be taken because there would be no physical injury to link back to. [4] X Research source If someone backed their car into yours and drove away, but you and your car are uninjured, this would be a case of “no harm, no foul”. Although they committed a hit and run, which is illegal, because there was no damage, it doesn’t matter because you wouldn’t have been able to take legal action anyways."
