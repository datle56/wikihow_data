      "content": "Consider preheating your oven before starting your recipe. Electrical ovens often need 10 to 15 minutes before they reach the proper temperature. This is often enough time to prepare your recipe. If you need more than 15 minutes in which to prepare the food, then consider starting the oven half-way through the preparation process."

      "content": "Rearrange the rack levels, if necessary. Most oven racks are set in the middle of the oven, but sometimes, the dish that you are baking will need to be placed higher or lower in the oven. Refer to your recipe, and if necessary, take out the oven rack and set it to the right level. There should be narrow ledges on the inside walls of your oven for the rack to sit on. Items that need to get browned and crispy on top, such as casseroles and lasagnas, are generally baked towards the top of the oven. [1] X Research source Items such as cakes, cookies, and cupcakes should be placed in the middle rack unless the recipe states otherwise. Items that need to get brown and crispy at the bottom, such as flatbreads and pizzas, are placed towards the bottom of the oven. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Turn the oven on and set the temperature. To get the right temperature, you will need to refer to your recipe. The oven temperature is usually at the very beginning of the recipe, in the first step. Simply grip the dial, press down on it, and turn it until the mark lands on the right temperature."

      "title": "Wait until the oven reaches the desired temperature.",
      "content": "Wait until the oven reaches the desired temperature. Most modern ovens have a setting that lets you either see the current temperature or beeps when ready. Some ovens have a little light that turns on when it is the right temperature. This light is usually next to the oven temperature dial. Most ovens take 10 to 15 minutes to heat up to the right temperature. If you have an older oven, you may not have a dial with the different temperatures written on it; you may just have an on-off switch. If this is the case, simply turn on the oven and wait 10 to 15 minutes before setting the items to be baked inside. [3] X Research source Consider using an oven thermometer. Sometimes, the temperature inside the oven is not accurate and does not actually match the temperature on the dial. An oven thermometer, which is usually placed inside the oven, will tell you the actual temperature. Refer to this thermometer instead of waiting for the indicator light to go on or for the oven to beep."

      "content": "Place the food inside the oven and let it bake according to the recipe. Make sure that the door is firmly closed, unless the recipe states otherwise, and do not peek inside your oven. Opening and closing the door while baking causes the internal heat to escape, which may result in longer baking times. If you plan on doing a lot of baking and using multiple racks, consider staggering the dishes and pans so that they are not parallel to each other. This will allow the hot air inside the oven to circulate around the food and distribute the heat more evenly."

Refer to your recipe and adjust the racks accordingly. Simply pull them out and reinsert them into the oven. The oven should have shallow ledges inside for the racks to sit on. Items, such as casseroles and lasagnas, need to be browned and crispy on top. They are generally placed towards the top of the oven. Cakes, cookies, and cupcakes need to be baked evenly and are usually placed in the middle rack unless the recipe states otherwise. Items, such as flatbreads and pizzas, need to get brown and crispy at the bottom. They are usually baked in the bottom level of the oven."

      "content": "Determine whether your oven ignites with a pilot or electrically. How your oven ignites will determine how you turn it on and set the temperature. Most older stoves will use a pilot light, while newer ones will rely on electricity to ignite. Here is how you can determine what sort of ignition your oven has: If your oven has a pilot-based ignition, you may notice a constantly burning flame that increases or decreases in size depending on the temperature If your oven has an electric-based ignition, you will not see the flames until you turn on the oven and set the temperature."

      "content": "If the oven uses a pilot light, turn the oven on and set the temperature. You may have to press on the dial lightly before turning it. If the oven uses gas marks instead of Celsius or Fahrenheit, you will need to convert the mark. You will need to go on the internet and use an online conversion tool. Sometimes, the pilot light goes out or needs to be ignited before each use. If this happens, make sure that the temperature dials are set to \"off\" and locate the pilot light. Light a match and hold the flame next to the pilot hole. If the pilot light ignites, remove the match. If the pilot light does not ignite, turn the temperature up slightly."

Once you have set the temperature, hit \"Start.\" The numbers on the screen will change—this is the current temperature inside the oven. Wait as the temperature rises and reaches the original temperature you set. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "When the oven reaches the right temperature, place the food inside.",
      "content": "When the oven reaches the right temperature, place the food inside. Gas ovens heat up much faster than electric ones, so your oven should reach the proper temperature in 5 to 10 minutes. Keep the oven door closed unless the recipe states otherwise. Do not open the oven door and peek at your food, as this will cause the heat inside the oven to escape and prolong baking times. If you have a lot of baking to do and are planning on both racks, do not put too many dishes on the bottom rack. This may prevent the heat from reaching the food on the upper rack."
