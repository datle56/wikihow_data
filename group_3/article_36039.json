      "title": "Lie on your side, opposite of the pain.",
      "content": "Lie on your side, opposite of the pain. If you feel pain on the right side of your body, try lying down on the left side, or vice versa. Sometimes the discomfort experienced on one side will disappear if no additional pressure is applied to the area. Resting your body this way will also remove pressure from your joints and muscles. [1] X Research source If possible, do this whenever you experience severe sciatic pain. Purchase a pregnancy wedge pillow to place behind your back while you sleep if you tend to toss and turn at night."

      "content": "Support your spine with a small cushion when sitting. Place a small lumbar cushion behind your lower back when sitting down.
