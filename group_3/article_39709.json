      "content": "Intuition can be a powerful signal. It’s difficult to deny a strong feeling that appears in your daily life. When you feel something positive is about to happen, trust your gut and expand upon that feeling. It could guide you down a path of love or even manifest into finding the right partner. Gut feelings are guardian angels. If you’re around someone who makes you feel comfortable and understood, take it as a sign that they could be a potential partner. If this person makes you feel unworthy or unhappy, it’s time to minimize their presence in your life as much as possible."

      "content": "The universe can communicate with us through repeating numbers or sequences. Do you constantly see the same numbers on signs, doors, or clocks?

      "content": "If you constantly run into them, it could be a sign you should be with them. When the universe wants two people to meet, it typically creates unavoidable opportunities. [6] X Research source It could be as simple as bumping into someone every time you’re at the gym or seeing them at the most unexpected places. It could just be a coincidence if you bump into someone 1-2 times. Frequent run-ins, however, are not as common as you think. Consider each time and place you’ve seen them. If they don’t show up where or when you expect them to, take it as a sign that they aren’t supposed to be in your life."
