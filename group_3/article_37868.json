      "content": "Choose the second runner. The second runner should perfect their baton handling skills, as the second leg involves both receiving and passing the baton. This is a straight leg, so this is a good spot for a fast sprinter who is not really good at bends/curves. [2] X Research source This is a great spot for your fastest runner if they are much faster than the other three. [3] X Research source This is especially true if your fastest runner is also great at baton handoffs."

This position also benefits from good baton handoff skills, and from the ability to compete under the pressure. [4] X Research source Although unorthodox, it could be smart to put your fastest runner here if they are also good on bends. A 200m specialist could do well on this leg. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "End with an eager finisher. Many teams place their fastest runner last, perhaps so they can claim the glory! In fact, psychology may be more important than raw speed. This runner cannot get discouraged if they start the fourth leg behind the other teams. Choose a competitor who thrives under the end of race pressure. [6] X Research source If your two fastest runners are much faster than the other two, place them second and fourth. This allows you to maximize the distance they run. [7] X Research source At high levels of competition, choose a runner with advanced finishing techniques. [8] X Research source This includes \"lifting,\" a running form with light ground contact and rapid knee lifts, and lunging, a carefully timed forward fall so the chest crosses the finish line sooner.

[10] X Expert Source Kai Ng Certified Running Coach Expert Interview. 12 February 2021. Consider these problems before you finalize the positions, and don't hesitate to rearrange if issues arise during practice: Size differences: If one runner is much taller than another, they may have trouble exchanging batons smoothly. Space them out so they don’t have to do a baton exchange. [11] X Research source If a pair of athletes do not practice well together for temperamental reasons, and the coach cannot solve this problem, consider rearranging so they don't have a handoff together. If one athlete is particularly poor at passing, consider placing them fourth. If an athlete is poor at receiving, consider putting them first."

      "content": "Pick the baton exchange method. There are generally three methods of passing the baton: the upsweep, the down sweep, and the push pass. Try all three and see which your teammates prefer: [12] X Research source Upsweep: the outgoing runner runs with their hand behind them at hip level, palm down and thumb outstretched to form a V shape. The incoming runner inserts the baton upward between the thumb and fingers. Downsweep: similar to the upsweep, but the outgoing runner's hand is palm up and receives the baton in a downward motion. Push pass: the outgoing runner holds their arm high up behind them, with the palm sideways and the thumb pointing down. The incoming runner holds the baton vertically and pushes it into the palm."

When all goes well, the relay race is a smooth series of transfers, with no awkward jerks across the lane or switching from an athlete's left hand to the right. Practice this pattern until all four runners find it automatic: [13] X Research source First runner holds baton in right hand and runs on the inside edge of the lane. Second runner holds baton in left hand and stays on the outside. Third runner holds baton in right hand and stays on the inside. Fourth runner holds baton in left hand and receives on the outside."

The outgoing runner can start running up to 10 meters ahead of the changeover zone, but can only receive the baton within the zone. Use tactics as well as trial and error to find an exchange position that maximizes speed and smooth handoffs: Ideally, you can exchange the baton about 5 meters from the end of the zone. [14] X Research source This gives the outgoing runner more time to accelerate before receiving. [15] X Research source If the athletes have trouble with a quick handoff, or if they get nervous and slow down while waiting, exchange the baton just past the middle of the zone. [16] X Research source If one athlete is significantly faster than the others, they can receive earlier in the zone, carrying the baton for more than 100 meters."

The best way to prevent this is to form the habit of \"running through the zone.\" Keep up a full sprint until you're about halfway through the next leg. If both runners have positioned themselves well (on opposite sides of the lane), the incoming runner should be able to run close behind without fearing a collision."

Each exchange zone is marked on most tracks by large, usually red, triangles. There should be a smaller triangle that marks the acceleration zone, which is where the second runner should be positioned. The third runner should be at the second acceleration zone before the exchange zone, and the fourth runner should be at the last acceleration zone."
