      "title": "Go to the concert venue a day or two before the show.",
      "content": "Go to the concert venue a day or two before the show. It is best to familiarize yourself with the surroundings as much as possible. You don't want to be confused and wandering around when it is time to make your move. If you know where you're trying to go it won't look like you are attempting to sneak inside. We'll cover getting inside later."

    {
      "title": "Take note of the various entrances.",
      "content": "Take note of the various entrances. Look for alternate entrances the band and crew might use to access the venue. These can be easier to get inside than the main entrance. Check any perimeter fences at larger venues. Look for any spots that are ideal to climb over or go under to get inside. There may even be a back gate or entrance that will provide easier access."

      "title": "Chat up the bouncers or security guards.",
      "content": "Chat up the bouncers or security guards. You may be able to make a friend and get them to sneak you into the concert. [1] X Research source At the very least you can take the opportunity to talk about your upcoming gig here. That way when you attempt to sneak in the next day, the security guard may see your familiar face going past and not think anything about it. Listen for codes and clues to help get you in. If someone walks in while you're chatting pay attention to any things they say or names they might mention to get inside. Find out if they have a guest list, and the name of the person in charge of the guest list. The more you seem to know if you're caught, the better off you'll be. Some buildings have doors with keypad locks. If you see one, try to keep an eye out and catch someone using the code."

      "title": "Arrive early for the concert.",
      "content": "Arrive early for the concert. You may even want to arrive the day before while the staff is setting up at a large concert venue. You might be able to slip in unnoticed and hide under a truck or stage. Musicians usually arrive earlier in the afternoon at smaller venues to load their gear and perform a sound check. Security is pretty low before the concert, so getting in early is often your best chance at success."

    {
      "title": "Climb a fence.",
      "content": "Climb a fence. Big music festival venues usually have large, high fences. You may need to bring in a tall ladder to even have a chance at getting over. You can try to rig up a rope ladder to draw less attention to yourself. If you do make it over without injury, be prepared to run away from security and try to lose them in a crowd. [2] X Research source Climbing over a high fence is not easy or safe. You could fall or get injured, which will also mean getting caught. Itâ€™s advisable to avoid doing this in the first place due to the risk that it is an electric fence."

      "title": "Impersonate a roadie.",
      "content": "Impersonate a roadie. Look like a roadie by carrying an empty guitar case, walkie talkies, and papers that could pass for set lists or event schedules. Wear an ID badge. Have a forged ID ready if possible to identify you as 'crew.' Most security guards don't look closely at them and you might be able to get past. Be careful though, if caught with false credentials you could be charged with a crime. We'll cover more tips on blending in later."

    {
      "title": "Wear adhesive wristbands.",
      "content": "Wear adhesive wristbands. Many large concerts give out wristbands to ticket holders that allow them to get in and out of the venue. Save your old concert wristbands to try and find one that looks similar enough to get you inside. If you are at large outdoor venue, you can have someone inside remove their wristband, attach it to a rock or water bottle, and throw it over the fence to you. [3] X Research source Then you can put it on and calmly stroll inside."

      "title": "Walk in with a large crowd.",
      "content": "Walk in with a large crowd. Go for it. Don't turn back, don't hesitate. When there's a break, go for the doors as stealthily as possible. You're best off to wait for a distraction before trying. If you need to, make the distraction yourself. Tell the security there is a fight going on around the corner, or get a friend to ask a security guard some questions while you try to slip by him."

    {
      "title": "Wear dark, casual clothing.",
      "content": "Wear dark, casual clothing. The less attention you draw to yourself the better. [4] X Research source If possible, pick up attire similar to what the crew is dressed in so you look like you belong."
    },
    {
      "title": "Act natural.",
      "content": "Act natural. If you start freaking out and talking about how excited you are to see the band, people will begin to catch on. Play it cool. You can try to look busy or bored. If you want to fit in, it should seem like it's just another day at the office for you. Talk like you belong. If a crew member walks by, casually say hello. A simple nod works well, too. Don't overdo it and end up drawing their attention. If they stop you and question you, laugh it off. Then tell them you work at the venue, or you're with the band. [5] X Research source Make eye contact. Don't hang your head down or try to stay unnoticed. The more you act like you aren't doing anything wrong, the better the chance you have."

      "title": "Head to your destination.",
      "content": "Head to your destination. Don't stop or slow down too much. Keep moving like you know where you're going, even if you don't. Watch where the staff and band members go and observe what they do. Pick up on it and follow like you belong there. By watching enough people, you'll figure out how to blend in and seem inconspicuous."
