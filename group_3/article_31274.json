      "content": "Some muslims use naseeb to describe their god-given partner. In the Qu’ran, Allah (SWT) created al-Qalam , or The Pen, and commanded it to write all things that would happen on a “preserved tablet” of fate— al-Lawh al-Mahfuz . On this tablet, your name was written next to the partner Allah (SWT) predetermined for you. [2] X Research source Your relationship with your naseeb will feel different from your other relationships. While it may not be easy, it will be your most fulfilling partnership. The Islamic faith believes in both determinism and free will. While Allah (SWT) has predetermined everything, humans were also gifted the ability to make decisions, which is why we’re responsible for our actions. Because of this, it may be helpful to think of al-Lawh al-Mahfuz as containing every possible reality, and not just the one you live in now. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "In Islam, your naseeb is linked to your taqdeer . Your taqdeer , or pre-destiny, is what Allah (SWT) will enact in your life. While some Imams claim that making dua can change your taqdeer , the change (and dua ) is already recorded, so it’s also recommended that you don’t ponder your fate too much—in Islam, only Allah (SWT) can know the future. [4] X Research source Taqdeer can also be thought of as the creative force of Allah (SWT), instead of pre-destiny. The many possible futures you have are unfolding from the will of Allah (SWT), which can become whatever Allah (SWT) pleases. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Your naseeb is not the same as your twin flame. While there’s a chance your naseeb is your twin flame, it’s not really recommended for twin flames to be romantically engaged, versus your naseeb , who people are often looking to marry. [6] X Research source While not all Muslims believe in twin flames, others liken them to human twins—if Allah (SWT) splits one egg and sperm into two genetically identical twins, why couldn’t Allah (SWT) split one soul into two bodies?"

      "content": "Naseeb can also be a poem or gender-neutral name. Pre-Islamic qaṣīdah poetry often began with nasīb , a short introduction to catch the reader’s attention. It was usually structured as the poet reminiscing over a past love whose memory was invoked by a certain space. [7] X Research source It can also be a first name in many of the languages that use this word."

      "content": "Say the dua in Qu’ran 28:24. My Lord! I am truly in [desperate] need of whatever provision You may have in store for me. Since your naseeb is your destiny, call to Allah (SWT) and surrender yourself to what your fate has in store. In the Qu’ran, Musa (peace be upon him) accidentally kills a man in Egypt, and has to flee to Midian. Alone and devastated, he meets two women and helps them water their animals. After, he sits under a tree and makes this dua to Allah (SWT), and in the same surrah the father of one of the women offers her hand in marriage to Musa (peace be upon him)."

      "content": "Ask Allah (SWT) for a good partner. In Islam, Allah (SWT) provides everything, and wants you to ask for everything. For your dua to be accepted, be completely sincere, and make it with the assurance that Allah (SWT) is listening and will do what is best for you. Start your dua by invoking one of Allah’s (SWT) 99 names, and finish by praising The Prophet (peace be upon him). [8] X Research source When asking for things, try using the names Al Razzaq or Al Wahhab. In the Qu’ran, The Prophet (peace be upon him) encourages people to ask for everything, down to the salt on their food and the laces on their shoes. [9] X Research source Try making dua like a child—ask for the smallest things, be earnest, and go into great detail."
