      "content": "A situationship is an undefined romantic relationship. There are many types of situationships , but what all of the different types have in common is that they’re incredibly vague and aren’t defined. Situationships aren’t labeled, and they often (but don't always) involve a partner who leads the relationship on without defining it. [1] X Research source Partners are intimate, but there’s a lack of obligation or exclusivity—there’s no clear boundary or label. [2] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source For example, that someone special you meet over summer break at the beach but never speak to again once school starts is a situationship. A situationship may also involve a couple in which one person would like to commit to a relationship, but the other is unsure of what they want or doesn't want to commit to the other person, and so they intentionally avoid defining the relationship. While the ambiguity of a situationship can be exciting, it may also cause anxiety and stress."

      "content": "Situationships lack boundaries and tend to be pretty superficial. There are many kinds of situationships, so it may be tricky to tell whether you’re in one or not. Most situationships, however, have these common characteristics: [3] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source No labels or exclusivity. The relationship is never defined by either party. You’re never “girlfriend,” “boyfriend,” or “partner.” No clear boundaries. The relationship isn’t defined, so it can be difficult to establish boundaries about wants and needs. Irregular or superficial contact. Those in a situationship likely only talk or reach out to one another when the right scenario comes around. Communication is sporadic. Lack of integration. In a situationship, both parties don’t include each other in their personal lives. The connection doesn’t go beyond those involved. Zero growth. The relationship stays stagnant in a situationship. It doesn’t grow or expand into something that could grow into a long-term partnership."

      "content": "A FWB relationship involves agreed-upon, non-committal sex. A friends-with-benefits (FWB) relationship is exactly what it sounds like—a pair of friends with sexual benefits. With this relationship, there are no strings attached, and most importantly, both parties know it and agree to it upfront. You’re sexually available for each other without being in a strict, exclusive relationship. Both parties are aware that the relationship will never become serious. [4] X Research source Unlike random hookups, you get to know the other person intimately because you see each other regularly. [5] X Research source For example, an FWB relationship could involve regularly hooking up with a friend and not expecting an emotional connection that goes beyond physical intimacy. Keegan describes a FWB relationship as \"no strings attached [relationship], but every version of that relationship has to be between the two people and what they mean.\" FWB relationships can be slippery slopes, as it can be easy for both parties to attract feelings for one another that go beyond physical pleasure."

      "content": "FWB relationships need ground rules to prevent misunderstandings. Boundaries are incredibly important in FWB relationships as they can provide both parties with clarity to avoid miscommunications. In other words, making sure you’re on the same page before indulging in the relationship is key. Here are the ground rules to having a successful FWB relationship: [6] X Research source Understand that the relationship may not be exclusive. Jealous behavior can hinder an FWB relationship. FWBs are free to see anyone they like (unless discussed otherwise). Be noncommittal . The joy of an FWB is you can care about each other and be physically intimate without romantic obligations. Talk openly. Communication is key with FWB relationships. Discuss your wants, needs, and boundaries before diving in. Practice safe sex. FWB relationships aren’t necessarily exclusive, so be open with your partner about other sexual partners and get tested regularly to keep yourself (and partners) safe. Know you can end the relationship at any time. There are no strings attached with an FWB, so it’s okay to end the physical intimacy if a long-term partner is found or the sexual tension fizzles out."

[7] X Research source No labels: Situationships and FWBs don’t have labels, making them undefined and vague relationships. Heartbreak: Both situationships and FWBs can be risky and cause heartbreak. Friends with benefits often lack depth, and situationships can start and end abruptly."

      "title": "Differences",
      "content": "Differences Rules: Friends-with-benefits relationships have general rules for parties to follow—there’s a clear set of boundaries. Situationships often lack this. Clarity: In situationships, it’s generally unclear where the relationship is headed, whereas in FWB relationships, both parties agree the relationship is merely sexual and won’t become serious. Emotional involvement: FWB relationships focus less on emotional connection and more on physical intimacy, whereas situationships often form from an emotional connection that stems from a situational commonality. Exclusivity: Exclusivity can be fuzzy for situationships. Depending on the scenario, it could be implied that a situationship is supposed to be exclusive for the time being. FWBs are often non-exclusive and encourage parties to explore relationships with others."

You have little to no expectations about the potential of the relationship turning into something more—you’re just excited to hook up and have fun! [8] X Research source If you agree with these statements, you’re likely in a FWB relationship: You think of them as a “friend you hook up with” rather than a “boyfriend” or “girlfriend.” You’re not romantically committed to your partner. You feel free to be intimate with other people. Your friend also doesn't feel committed or expect anything from you."
