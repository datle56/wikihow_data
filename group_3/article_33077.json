      "title": "Complete the tutorial.",
      "content": "Complete the tutorial. When you start a new game of Clash of Clans, you start with a Town Hall, Gold Mine, Army Camp, and Builder's Hut. The game has a tutorial that teaches you the basics of how to build your base, attack other bases, train troops, and get new resources. Read the on-screen instructions and tap the icons that have an arrow pointing to them to complete the tutorial. Ignore the game's insistence on using gems to upgrade buildings, you should save these for builder huts. When you are finished with the tutorial, you will have new cannon, elixir collector, elixir storage, builder's hut, and barracks with trained troops. Try to keep your town hall in the center of your town to keep it more secure. A marker will show the center of the base. The tutorial will offer you some basic information to get started."

      "title": "Open the Shop.",
      "content": "Open the Shop. The Shop is the icon with gold and a hammer in the lower-right corner. This is where you purchase new buildings for your town. Some items can be purchased with gold or elixir, while others require gems to purchase. Some require experience or a leveled up town hall to purchase. Use the following steps to navigate the shop: Buildings and Traps: This section is under the tab that has an icon that resembles a saw and hammer. This is where you will purchase most of your items from. Tap the Army tab to purchase offensive buildings, such as Barracks, and Army camps. The Resources tab is where you purchase resource-specific buildings, such as Gold Mines, and Elixir collectors. The Defenses tab is where you purchase defensive buildings, such as walls, cannons, and archer towers. The Traps tab is where you purchase traps you can put in your town. Decorations: The Decorations tab has an icon that resembles a sword in a stone. This is where you can purchase decorative buildings for your town. This includes statues, torches, and flags. Treasures: This is the tab that has an icon that resembles an elixir bulb, gem, and stack of gold. This is where you can purchase gems using real money. You can then use the gems your purchase to buy more gold or elixir. Shield: This is the tab that has an icon that resembles a shield with arrows sticking out of it. This is where you can buy shields to protect your town for a certain amount of time. League shop: This has a tab with a league metal on it.

      "title": "Purchase walls for defense.",
      "content": "Purchase walls for defense. Since you have limited resources at first, place the walls around the most important buildings only, such as the town hall, gold storage(s) and elixir storage(s). Place the builder's huts and army buildings outside the perimeter of the wall. To purchase items from the shop, open the shop and then tap the item you want to purchase. Tap where you want to place it on the map. To move buildings and items on your map, tap the object you want to move. Then tap and drag it to a new location."

      "title": "Spend your gold, elixir, and gems wisely.",
      "content": "Spend your gold, elixir, and gems wisely. Do not waste them, especially your gems as they come in short supply. Use your gems to build builder's huts. It is tempting to use them all right away, but you will need your gems later. The most efficient way to spend gems is to invest in three more builder's huts. This enables you to upgrade multiple towers and other defenses at once. In the tutorial, you are given 5 wizards to destroy the base. Only two wizards are needed to defeat the 1st goblin base. So if you only use two, you will have the other 3 in your army camp already. However, the wizards may be taken away from you without notice after the tutorial is complete. Don't upgrade the second gold or elixir storage at first. You will need them at level one to upgrade to Town Hall level 4, but that doesn't mean you need them upgraded further."

      "content": "Use traps as much as possible. Traps do a lot of damage to attacking enemies and are worth upgrading. The one-time-hit damage can easily take out groups of smaller troops and seriously hurt larger types too. Put them in sneaky places that people wouldn't expect. Putting a trap in a wall compartment of its exact size can make it more obvious there's a trap there, so try putting them in gaps you leave in the base that aren't surrounded by adjacent walls."

      "title": "Protect all of your defenses.",
      "content": "Protect all of your defenses. Eventually, you can aspire to more advanced defenses, such as archer towers, and air defenses. Mortars do a lot of damage per shot but they shoot very slowly. Keep these in the center of your base because of their blind spot and their superb range. If you do not protect your air defenses your base will fall to healers."

You may want to lose trophies to get resources from easier defenders. You will not get as much per raid but it's easier and you don't have to spend as much on your army. It is easier to steal resources than mine for them. Use the following steps to attack: Tap the orange icon that says Attack in the lower-right corner. Tap Singleplayer or Multiplayer . On Singleplayer, tap one of the circles on the map to launch an attack. For multiplayer, tap Find a match . Multiplayer matches cost 50 or more gold depending on the current Town Hall level."

After a successful attack, you will bring back more gold and elixir, which you can then spend. If you are losing an attack, there is no shame in just surrendering. You can always train more troops later. Know when to quit. If you quit before deploying all troops the remaining troops will still be usable in the next battle. When you attack storages and resource collectors, the resources will go into your bank account immediately. Even if your troops are killed during the attack, the resources remain in your account. You get even more treasure/bonuses if you destroy the opponent's base or town hall which gets you one-star meaning victory."
