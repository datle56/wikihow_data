      "title": "Make a list of people to send cards to.",
      "content": "Make a list of people to send cards to. Like Santa, you'll want to make a list and check it twice. This way you'll buy enough cards at the store and won't forget anyone. You can also check off people's names as you finish each card. It's a good idea to double-check the addresses of people on your list during this stage."

    {
      "title": "Choose an appropriate card design.",
      "content": "Choose an appropriate card design. Select a Christmas card that fits with the holiday or appeals to your loved ones. You could get a card with a Christmas tree, angel, Santa, or red robin on it. If you know your recipient is not religious, then nativity Christmas cards aren't a good idea. There are also humorous cards available, if you have loved ones with a funny bone."

    {
      "title": "Order a custom printed card.",
      "content": "Order a custom printed card. Many custom print shops offer holiday themed cards for less than a local printer. [2] X Research source These sites typically allow you to select your quantity, cardstock, images, even a family photo, and write a nice message inside. Many shops have a minimum number of cards they need to print. Make sure to order your custom cards several weeks ahead of the holidays. This gives the printer plenty of time to get the order made and sent to you. Take a holiday themed family photo with yourself and loved ones wearing Christmas sweaters. You can upload this to use as the cover image on a photo card."

    {
      "title": "Make a homemade Christmas card.",
      "content": "Make a homemade Christmas card. Purchase some blank cardstock and holiday themed craft supplies to experiment with your own holiday cards. You can use an ink stamp with the words, \"Merry Christmas,\" on it to make a message inside the card. Create paper cutouts of holiday items by using simple templates to cut images from recycled paper. You can take images from magazines and turn them into Christmas trees, ornaments, and snowmen. Use a glue stick to adhere the images to your cardstock. Decorate the card with some white, red, green, or silver glitter to enhance your design."

    {
      "title": "Write a greeting.",
      "content": "Write a greeting. Write \"Dear,\" or \"To,\" and then, the addressee's name. This should go near the top of the inside of the card. Some people like to place the greeting above any pre-printed messages in the card."
    },
    {
      "title": "Write a salutation in the middle of the card.",
      "content": "Write a salutation in the middle of the card. You don't have to include this if the card already has a pre-printed message. However, it helps to personalize the card with a short holiday themed salutation. It can be something as simple as \"Merry Christmas!\" If you want, write a little passage just below the salutation! Something like a poem, a short message, or a passage about the person works."
    },
    {
      "title": "Finish it off with a closing statement.",
      "content": "Finish it off with a closing statement. These are short phrases or words that signal the end of your message within the card. You'll also place your name directly after or below the closing. For example, you can use, \"From, Your Name\", as a closing statement. Other closing statements to try include: love, yours sincerely, yours faithfully, best wishes, season's blessings, or even a few X's and O's, which mean \"Hugs and Kisses\". [3] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Add a memento or gift item.",
      "content": "Add a memento or gift item. People often include small things, such as photographs, with annual Christmas cards. This serves to update others on how your family has changed and provide more in-depth information that can't be written in the card itself. Collect together a few family photos or school photos of your children to place inside the cards. You may also want to purchase a gift card to a restaurant or store where the addressee lives to include as a more substantial item. You can also write a \"Christmas Letter\" with more information about what has happened during the year. Most letters reference positive events, such as awards, family trips, or new jobs. Save some time by writing the letter in a word processing document and printing out multiple copies for each of the Christmas cards you'll send."

    {
      "title": "Address the envelope to your addressee.",
      "content": "Address the envelope to your addressee. Most store-bought cards come with an envelope, if not, you can buy one separate. Write the address on the center of the front of the envelope. [4] X Research source The address should include the person's name, street and house or apartment number, city, state, and zip code. For formal Christmas cards, make sure to address your recipient with the appropriate title."

      "title": "Write a return address on the envelope.",
      "content": "Write a return address on the envelope. If the post office has trouble delivering your card, they'll be able to send it back to you at this address. You can write the return address on the upper left corner of the envelope or on the top center of the back flap."

    {
      "title": "Place your card inside the envelope.",
      "content": "Place your card inside the envelope. Most envelopes have pre-applied adhesive on the flap that you can activate by wetting. When you close the flap, press firmly along the edge to ensure a good seal. You can lick the adhesive on the envelope with your tongue. You may also use a slightly damp sponge, cotton swab, or an envelope moistener to wet the adhesive. [5] X Research source Another option is to use a glue stick to seal the envelope. This works well when the adhesive isn't strong."

      "content": "Put a stamp on the upper right corner of the envelope. The post office offers holiday themed stamps, if you want to use them on your Christmas Cards. Once the envelope is sealed and stamped you can place it in the nearest postal mailbox for delivery. [6] X Research source"
