Once you open the app, the welcome screen will display the list of applications already installed in your Android device. Scroll through the list to search for the app to share. You can also make use of the search bar at the top to search for the app."

      "content": "Select the apps. Each app will have a checkbox next to it. As you locate the apps you want to share, tap to check them. You can tap as many apps as you want to share."

      "content": "Select the sharing mode. Above the search bar are two sharing modes: “Link” or “APK.” Tapping “Link” will provide you with the URL to the app’s downloading page, which is Google Play. Tapping “APK” will allow you to send the entire setup of the application to your friend’s device."

      "title": "Share the app(s).",
      "content": "Share the app(s). Next to the “Link” and “APK” option is a “Share” button. Tap this to view the options available. You can share via WhatsApp, Pinterest, Bluetooth, Email, Facebook, Flipboard, Gmail, Google +, and more. Sharing via social media—Tapping the name of a social network will open the network’s app on your device, where you can post the link or file. Sharing via email—If you tap Email, your email app will open to a new message that contains the links to download the app. You can then send this to your friends. If you chose to share the APK of the app, it would be best to share the app as an email as these files can be large. Sharing via Bluetooth—If your friend is in close proximity, you can opt to send the app through Bluetooth. Bluetooth is generally the fastest option. Enable Bluetooth on both your device and your friend’s device, and tap the Bluetooth option."
