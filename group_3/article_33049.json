You'll want to be selecting words or phrases that will come up in the meeting. The best phrases are the ones that come up so often that they make you want to roll your eyes.These phrases are the equivalent of traditional Bingo numbers in Bullshit Bingo. There are websites that can create automatically generated lists and even allow for mobile and tablet play, but creating your own buzzwords is more fun. You'll want to decide whether you and your opponents will be sharing from a common \"phrase bank\" or making individual ones. If using your own phrase bank, common phrases that your opponents won't think of are especially valuable. You want to have a few unique phrases that will set you apart from the competition in order to gain an edge."

You can also add \"Wild\" spots to your grid if anyone in your game can't quite come up with enough words to fill the grid. Some players share a pool of collective cliches, but select where on their grid they want them to be listed. Shared words eliminate part of the skill aspect of the game though."
