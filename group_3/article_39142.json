      "content": "Fold over the edges of the fabric by 0.25 to 0.5 in (0.64 to 1.27 cm). Use a ruler or fabric measuring tape to find the spot on the fabric that is 0.25 to 0.5 in (0.64 to 1.27 cm) from the edge, and then make the first fold here. With your fabric facing right (print) side down, fold over the edges of the fabric. Fold the fabric in towards the center of the piece of fabric so that the raw edges will be hidden. [1] X Research source Make these folds along any adjoining edges where you want a mitered corner to be."

      "title": "Fold again to the width you want your border to be.",
      "content": "Fold again to the width you want your border to be. Measure from the folded edge with a ruler or fabric measuring tape. Fold the edges in the same way as before, but make the fold as wide as you want the border on your item to be. For example, if you want a 1 inch (2.5 cm), then make a 1 inch (2.5 cm) fold along each of the edges. [2] X Research source This second fold will completely hide the raw edges on your fabric. Repeat this second fold on all of the edges you have already folded."

      "content": "Press the folded fabric with an iron . After you have folded an edge, use an iron to press it. Run the iron up and down the folded edge of the fabric a few times to press it. This will make a crease in the fabric, which will make it easier to identify where to sew the corners. [3] X Research source Repeat this on all of the folded edges."

      "content": "Open up the last fold you made so that the crease is visible. After you have finished ironing the last folded edge, open up the second fold you made in the fabric so that you can see the crease. This will be your guide for determining where to sew the mitered corner. [4] X Research source Make sure to leave the first fold you made. Do not unfold it. Repeat this for each of the edges."

      "content": "Multiply the width of the border by 2. This will be the distance you need to measure from the corner of the fabric, which will allow you to create the mitered corner. For example, if you want to create a 1 in (2.5 cm) border, then multiply 1 in (2.5 cm) by 2 for a total of 2 in (5.1 cm)."

Sew right off the edge when you get to the end. [9] X Research source Repeat this for each of the corners you have marked. To make the stitch extra secure, you can backstitch at the beginning and end of the stitch, or sew over the line twice. However, this is optional."
