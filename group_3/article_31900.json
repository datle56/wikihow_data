      "content": "Greet people you know well with “Hi” or “Hey!” There are lots of ways to say “Hello” and greet people in English that are perfect for informal situations. Say these phrases with people you know well, like friends, family members, casual acquaintances, and coworkers or colleagues you have a close relationship with. You can use these phrases on their own, or follow them with the person’s name (ex: “Hi, Sam!”). [1] X Research source “Hi!” “Hey, Amari!” “Hiya!” “Heyo!” “Hey, you!” “Holla!” If you know the person really well , lengthen your “Hi” or “Hey.” For instance, lots of English speakers greet their friends by saying, “Hiiiiiii,” “Heeeeey,” or “Helloooooo!”"

      "content": "Say “How’s it going” or “What’s up” as an alternative. In English-speaking countries, it’s common practice to greet someone you know by asking them how they’re doing instead of saying “Hello.” It’s okay to use some of these phrases in casual situations at the workplace, but stick to using the very informal greetings with your friends and family members. [2] X Research source Casual (coworkers, colleagues, friends, family, acquaintances): “How’s it going, Carlos?” “How are you? “How are things?” “What’s new?” Very casual (friends, family): “What’s up, Dina?” “How ya been?” “What’s poppin’?” “What’s good?” “What’s happenin’?” “What’s goin’ on?” “How you doin’?” “How’s you?” “What’s crackin’?”"

      "content": "Use slang phrases like “‘Sup” and “Yo” to greet close friends. To help you sound like a native English speaker, use slang to say “Hello” to your closest friends. These phrases are super informal, so say them in casual situations with people you know very well. “‘Sup, Joseph!” “Yo!” “Whassup!” “What’s good in the hood?” Feel free to replace your friend’s name with a slang term like, “bro,” “dude,” “girl,” or “homie.” For instance, you might say “‘Sup, bro!” or “Whassup, homie!” Expert note : Before you start using slang, Griffin Bassett, linguistics expert, recommends that you understand where the terms come from. He says that lots of slang, like “What’s good in the hood,” come from African American English (AAE) and “might sound a bit strange if used by an English learner who doesn't necessarily understand their social context.” It’s important to understand a slang term’s origins to ensure you aren’t being culturally insensitive by using it. In particular, using AAE slang can be considered cultural appropriation if it’s not part of your normal dialect or you use it in a performative or mocking way. [3] X Research source"

Besides “Hello,” saying either “Good morning,” “Good afternoon,” or “Good evening” are the most formal ways to greet someone in English. Use these when greeting someone you don’t know well, authority figures (like bosses or teachers), and people older than you. [4] X Research source When to say : Before 12:00 pm, say, “Good morning.” Between 12:00 pm and 5:00 pm, say, “Good afternoon.” After 5:00 pm, say, “Good evening.” For a more personal “Hello,” say the person’s name after your greeting. Just make sure to use their proper title to stay polite, if they have one (ex: “Good morning, Mr. Smith.”). Note : While “How do you do,” “Greetings,” and “Salutations” are very formal greetings, most US English speakers don’t say them."

If you’re saying “Hello” to someone you’ve met once or who you see infrequently (like a colleague’s husband), use a slightly formal greeting like “It’s nice to see you again.” This is a great way to acknowledge them without being overly casual or friendly. “It’s nice to see you again, Felix.” “It’s good to see you again.” “It’s nice to meet you again.” “Hello, again!”"
