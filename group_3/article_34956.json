It starts with a decision point: you can decide to quit completely, or you can set specific limits on the number of drinks you have per day and which days you are allowed to drink. The right approach depends on the person, so give it some thought: An abstinence approach means you stop drinking completely. If you are motivated to reach this goal, go for it. If you find it impossible, get severe physical withdrawal symptoms, or end up in a cycle of abstinence and major relapses, consider switching to harm reduction. [1] X Research source A harm reduction approach means you set limits and practice safer drinking. If you are not willing or able to completely stop drinking right now, this is a good option. You may find it leads to safer, healthier habits that satisfy your goals; or you may use it as a \"best possible\" option for now.

Quitting alcohol can be an emotional see-saw: you can be satisfied and happy about your decision today, and just want to crawl back to the bottle tomorrow. If you put the ways you benefit from quitting onto paper, and carry that list in your wallet, you can store up those positive feelings to help you out through the bad times. Reasons you want to quit could include feeling better physically and mentally; sleeping better; improving your health; feeling less shame, anxiety, or depression; avoiding arguments; having healthier relationships with other people; doing better at work; having more time and energy; being there for your family; or keeping your loved ones safe."

If you have any decorative bottles or alcohol signs, get rid of these too or put them in storage. They can also trigger your urges to drink."

At the very least, the people who care about you need to respect your choice and not offer you alcohol. You can also ask for reasonable behavior changes from the people you live with or who you see most often: [5] X Research source Ask them to hide or lock up their alcohol, or at least not to leave open containers out. Ask them to drink outside the house, or to use opaque cups so you can't see the booze. Ask them to avoid returning home drunk or hungover, or to let you know so you can spend that night at a friend's. Explain that the early stages of quitting are a lot easier if you aren't around these triggers. This is a temporary favor you're asking, and it's about you and your own recovery—not a judgement on them. [6] X Research source"

If your drinking buddy won't stop pressuring you, think about what that relationship was actually about. Did you spend quality time with each other, or just enable each other's drinking? Look at your list of reasons to quit—shouldn't your friend want those things for you? Set down a firm rule if you have to: \"I've asked you to stop offering me drinks, but you won't stop.

This helps you avoid the triggers when you can, and plan your response when you can't: [11] X Research source First list external triggers: what objects, people, and places make you want to drink? What about times of day, or events? These can be general (\"drunk people\") or specific (\"my friend Andrew\"). Next list internal triggers: what moods or emotions lead you to drink?

If being alone on a Friday night makes you drink, invite a friend over for a weekly hangout. If talking to your brother stresses you out, and stress makes you drink, stop answering his phone calls. Set hard boundaries and make big changes if that's what you need to succeed—it will be worth it. Social events with booze involved are a trigger for almost every recovering drinker.
