      "content": "Understand what a script is. Scripts are lines of code that contain instructions for a game or program to follow. In Roblox, scripts can be used to do everything from giving (or taking away) a player's health points, making objects move, or anything you can think of. Roblox uses a programming language called Lua. In Roblox, there are three types of scripts, which are as follows: Server Script: A server script is a script that is stored on the server. A server script creates actions in a game that can be seen by all players. Local Script: A local script is a script that is specific to a single player. A local script creates actions that can be seen by one player only. Module Script: A module script contains frequently used script functions that can be used by other scripts. This is a good way to organize frequently used code so that you don't have to copy and paste or reuse the same code in multiple scripts. [1] X Research source"
