      "content": "Guess the prices of different items to earn chips. On The Price is Right, contestants start the game of Plinko by earning their chips. The more Plinko chips you have, the more prizes and money you can potentially win. You’ll be shown items, and asked to decide if you think the price of the item starts with 1 specific digit or ends with another specific digit. Use your best judgment, as you’ll earn 1 chip for every digit you guess correctly. [1] X Research source For example, you may be shown a cooler that retails at $25 USD and asked if the price for it starts with a “2” or a “1.” If you guess “2,” then you’ll earn a Plinko chip."

Watch the chip fall and bounce between pegs until it lands in a slot at the bottom of the board. Repeat this process of choosing an entry slot, lining the chip up, and dropping it in for the rest of your chips. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Collect prizes for each slot your chips land in without hitting $0 USD. The slots at the bottom are labeled with certain amounts of money. Every time 1 of your chips falls into a specific slot, the amount of money indicated on the slot will be added to your total prize money. However, if 1 of your chips lands in the $0 slot, you do not win any extra money. [4] X Research source From 1 end to the other, the slots are usually worth $100, $500, $1,000, $0, $10,000, $0, $1,000, $500, and $100. If you drop a chip in, it lands in the $0 slot, and you have more chips to drop in, you can still use those to collect some prize money."

If you want the best possible chances of your chips landing in the $10,000 slot, drop each chip through an entry slot located at the middle of the board. While the game is mostly based on luck, chips dropped through the middle of the top are statistically the most likely to win you the big bucks. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Try inserting the chip 3 or 4 spaces away from the center. As an alternative, consider dropping your chips 3-4 spaces to either the left or right of the center entry slot. Some think that this is a better strategy because the chips bounce around a lot, and therefore aren’t likely to travel downward in a straight line. [6] X Research source"

While there’s not proof one way or another, many believe that it’s best to hold each chip above the entry slot and simply let it go. [7] X Research source"

Push a tee through the second hole and continue pushing them through every other hole horizontally from left to right. This will offset the new row of pegs from the previous one.

You can make these prizes whatever you want, whether you prefer that they’re traditional cash prizes, school-related prizes for playing Plinko in a classroom, or small toys for a kid’s birthday party. [13] X Research source If you decide to go with cash prizes and want your game to closely resemble traditional Plinko, label the center slot as the highest value and the slots on either side of it as $0. If you’re playing Plinko with students in a classroom, consider labeling one slot as a free pencil and another slot as a homework pass. If you’re playing Plinko at a kid’s birthday party, consider having prizes like stickers, markers, and small stuffed animals."
