If you do, turn the container upside down over a disposable napkin and let excess oil drain out. Dispose of the napkin in the trash. When oil has stopped dripping out of the bottle, fill it with hot water and a bit of liquid soap, replace the cap, and shake it several times. Empty the soapy water in your sink."

You’ll probably have to pay for pick-up service, but you’ll save time and won’t have to make a trip to a recycling center. Use the Earth911 recycling search at https://search.earth911.com/?utm_source=earth911-header&utm_medium=top-navigation-menu&utm_campaign=top-nav-recycle-search-button to find a recycling program near you.

      "content": "Check with your local recycling program to see if your empty oil containers are accepted. First, identify what type of plastic your oil container is by looking on the bottom or side of the container. Locate the number inside the recycling triangle. [2] X Research source Then, contact your local recycling program and ask for details about recycling containers of this type. Many recycling programs offer explicit lists of what they accept and do not accept on their websites. Most oil bottles are made from clear number one plastic. This is the most common kind of plastic, and empty oil containers are usually accepted along with the rest of your recyclable plastic and other materials."

      "title": "Drop off or await pickup for your recyclables.",
      "content": "Drop off or await pickup for your recyclables. Pick-up services operate just like municipal trash collection does: a truck will come by on a designated day, usually once each week, and collect your recycling in a bin. The bin is usually provided by the collector, but there might be a small fee. Drop-off locations require you to load up your empty oil containers and other recycling materials and drop them in the appropriate bin. For instance, there might be a bin for number one and two plastics, another bin for paper and cardboard, and another bin for glass. If you’re dropping off your recyclables, you’ll save time if you sort everything according to the categories of recyclables accepted at your recycling center. For instance, you might have one bin for newspaper and junk mail, another for clear glass, another for colored glass, another for number one and two plastic, and another for all other types of plastic. Pickup services are typically single-stream. In other words, there is no need to sort glass, plastic, and paper into separate bins. Instead, drop all your recyclables into a single bin and place it in a location where the recycling service can access it (usually near the foot of your driveway)."

      "content": "Repurpose the empty oil containers if possible. An even more ecologically friendly option for handling your empty oil containers is reusing them. For example, you can cut the tops from the oil containers and use them to organize tools and hardware in your garage. You could also cut a clean oil bottle lengthwise, fill it with dirt, and use it as a starter bed for small plants. [3] X Research source Make sure not to store anything that would be harmed by exposure to the oil residue."

A plastic jug or glass flour container with a volume of about one gallon are good choices. If your oil has solidified, throw the solid mass in the trash. Wipe the remainder out of the pan with a napkin and throw it out as well. [4] X Research source The number of times you can reuse your oil depends on a number of factors, including the type of oil, the temperature you cook at, and the way you use it. [5] X Research source For instance, cooking oil at a temperature above 375 degree Fahrenheit can lead to the accumulation of HNE, a toxic substance that can lead to negatively impact your health.

Even if your own pipes don’t end up clogged, you’ll be contributing to the congestion of your local sewer system. In high-density areas, especially, this can cause real problems. Wipe greasy pans and plates off with disposable napkins before washing them in the sink. Throw the napkins in the trash. If you accidentally pour oil down the drain, pour a couple cups of boiling water in after it. [9] X Research source Add a spoonful of vinegar and baking soda to the water to make it even more effective."

Alternately, you might be able to convert your engine and feed it straight vegetable oil. Contact your local university or auto shop and inquire about how you can incorporate used vegetable oil into your vehicle."

Once you’ve located a site or program that will accept your used motor oil, follow the appropriate directions to ensure it arrives safely to where it needs to go. Whether you drop the oil off or arrange for pickup, place it in a container of an appropriate type. Usually, you will need to place your used motor oil in a clear, sealable container like a used milk jug. Do not pour oil down a sewer or in the gutter, and do not pour it onto empty land. Oil that is improperly disposed of can poison aquifers and groundwater."
