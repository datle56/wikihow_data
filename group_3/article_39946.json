      "title": "Use a dab tool to divide a moonrock nug into small bits.",
      "content": "Use a dab tool to divide a moonrock nug into small bits. When handling moonrocks, it’s best to use a stainless steel dab tool, tweezers, or a knife and fork to break the nug down. Pull the moonrock apart until you have a crumble. Moonrocks are coated with oil and kief, which can leave your fingertips covered in sticky residue and remove the goodness you’re trying to smoke! If you’re using your fingertips, be sure to wash your hands with soap and water. Use hand sanitizer or alcohol wipes to remove any stubborn residue. Using glass products like a bong, bubbler, or pipe is recommended since keeping a moonrock lit is difficult."

      "content": "Pour enough water to cover the bong’s percolator. A percolator is usually a dome-shaped glass piece inside the bong. It sits at the bottom of the glassware and creates bubbles inside the water chamber. The bubbles maximize the surface area of the smoke, cooling and filtering it so you can smoke it. [1] X Research source If you’re using a pipe, skip this step and go directly to packing the pipe with a pinch or two of traditional bud and top it with moonrocks."

      "title": "Pack a bowl with a pinch or two of traditional bud.",
      "content": "Pack a bowl with a pinch or two of traditional bud. If you have a larger bit of cannabis, place it at the bottom of the bowl to act as a screen. You can also use a bowl screen to prevent any cannabis from falling into the bong water. Then, layer more cannabis on top and gently push down on the entire bowl to pack it in. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Top the cannabis with a 1-2 small chunks of moonrock. You can use your fingertips or a pair of tweezers to top the bud with the moonrock. Press it down firmly so it stays in place. Start with a small amount until you know how strong the moonrocks are and how you’ll react to it."

      "title": "Use a lighter or hemp wick to burn the moonrock on low heat.",
      "content": "Use a lighter or hemp wick to burn the moonrock on low heat. Be careful when applying direct heat to the moonrocks. To smoke a bong, come in from a slight angle, allowing the tip of the flame to warm the wax, and watch it melt. You may need to light the moonrock a bit longer than traditional flowers. When you see red embers, pull until the bong fills with smoke. Remove the bowl piece from the stem and inhale the smoke you created. Exhale after briefly holding the smoke in your lungs. Give yourself a few moments before taking another hit. Moonrocks are much stronger than traditional bud, so go slow and steady."

      "content": "Place a large nug of moonrock into a grinder. For a smoother smoke and easier timer rolling, grind a nug of moonrock by placing it into the part of the grinder with “teeth.” Rotate the top of the grinder 3 to 4 times until you have a fine consistency with minor clumps. You can also use a combination of traditional bud and moonrocks for a less potent experience."

      "content": "Make a filter with accordion folds to help with airflow. Generally, when you purchase rolling papers, they’ll come with short, thick paper used as a tip or filter for a joint. To make a filter, fold the paper 3 or 4 times to create an accordion or zigzag fold. Roll the remaining paper around the roll to create a solid cylinder. [3] X Research source Place the filter at one end of the roller paper. You can also use business cards, the rolling paper pack, or thin pieces of cardboard if you don’t have filter paper."

To roll a joint, add two or three-quarter-sized pinches of moonrocks and shape the joint with your hands. [4] X Research source When using rolling paper, the end with the glue should be at the top, facing you. The joint will be made solely of moonrocks, which will have a strong potency. Be careful when smoking and take short, slow pulls until you know how you’ll react. To save the rest of the joint for later, stub out the lit end with the butt of your lighter to put it out."

Pinch paper between your fingers to get it to sneak behind the shake. Roll it back and forth to pack it into its final cone shape.
