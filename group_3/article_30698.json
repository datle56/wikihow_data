      "content": "Raise your arm while standing in front of a full-length mirror. Extend your arm straight out so it’s perpendicular to the rest of your body. You can work with either the left or right arm. [1] X Research source It is easier to take an accurate measurement for your arm hole if you have a helper. Your helper takes the measurement while you keep your arm in position. If you don’t have a helper, it's probably easier to measure the arm hole of your non-dominant arm while using your dominant hand to hold and maneuver the tape measure."

      "title": "Wrap the tape measure from the shoulder to the armpit.",
      "content": "Wrap the tape measure from the shoulder to the armpit. Position the starting (zero) end of the tape measure flat against the center of the top of your shoulder. Draw the tape measure down over the front of your shoulder and arm, pausing once it hits the center of your armpit. This measurement is sometimes referred to as your arm hole depth. [2] X Research source Continue around your armpit and shoulder if you need the full arm hole measurement instead of the depth measurement. Keep the tape measure flat against your body. It should also be vertically straight along the front of your body."

    {
      "title": "Wrap the tape measure back up to the shoulder.",
      "content": "Wrap the tape measure back up to the shoulder. Continue wrapping the tape measure around your arm and shoulder, drawing it up from behind your shoulder until it meets the starting end. This measurement is your full arm hole measurement. [3] X Research source The tape measure must be vertically straight along the back and front of your shoulder. Make sure that it also lies flat against your body. Note that your full arm hole measurement should be twice as large as your arm hole depth. Since the full arm hole measurement may not be exactly twice as large, it’s best to take the actual measurement instead of mathematically doubling the depth measurement."

      "title": "Hold the measuring tape loosely for a more comfortable measurement.",
      "content": "Hold the measuring tape loosely for a more comfortable measurement. With the tape measure held in place, move your arm around. Rotate it back and forth, then up and down. Avoid holding the tape measure so tightly that it restricts your arm movement in any way. Place two fingers underneath the measuring tape and against your body as you take the measurement to keep the tape loose. Avoid stretching the tape as you take the measurement to prevent it from being too tight. When in doubt, a slightly larger measurement is better than one that’s too small. To ensure the arm hole is located in the right place, measure the circumference of your chest, from the center of your back to the tip of your shoulder, and from the center of your back to your hip, suggests apparel manufacturing specialist Alessio Iadicicco.

      "content": "Place a well-fitting shirt on a flat surface. Choose a shirt with comfortable, appropriately sized arm holes. Spread the shirt out flat over a table or desk and smooth it so there’s no bunching around the arm hole area. If the shirt is a button-down, make sure to button it up first. [5] X Research source The sleeve length of the shirt does not matter. It can even be sleeveless as long as it has an actual armhole. Avoid using a tank top with spaghetti straps, a halter top, or a strapless top. This method is good to use if you do not have a helper to assist you in taking a traditional arm hole measurement."

      "title": "Curve the tape measure around the front arm hole.",
      "content": "Curve the tape measure around the front arm hole. With the front of the shirt facing up, position the starting (zero) end of the tape measure at the top of the arm hole seam. Then, carefully run the tape measure along the curve of the seam until it reaches the bottom. [6] X Research source Keep the tape measure on its side as you wind it around the arm hole seam. Align the tape measure to this seam as precisely as possible. The resulting measurement corresponds to your arm hole depth. It’s about half of your full arm hole measurement."

      "title": "Flip the shirt over and measure the back of the arm hole separately.",
      "content": "Flip the shirt over and measure the back of the arm hole separately. Smooth the shirt out, then measure the back arm hole seam with your tape measure. Position the starting end of the tape at the top of the arm hole seam. Extend the tape down the curve of the seam until it reaches the bottom. Your front and back arm hole depth will usually be the same. The back arm hole depth can occasionally be larger by as much as 5/8 inch (1.6 cm), though, so take both measurements separately just to be safe."

      "content": "Add the two measurements together to get the full arm hole measurement. This is only an estimate of your true arm hole measurement, so it’s not quite as accurate as a traditional measurement. However, it will produce satisfactory results in most instances."

      "content": "Identify the stitching line on the pattern piece. The stitching line is the dotted line indicating where you make your stitches. [7] X Research source If you’re drafting the pattern from scratch instead of working with a commercial pattern or previously made pattern, use a French curve or curved ruler to sketch the stitching line and make sure the seam allowances are the same all along the arm hole."

      "title": "Measure along the curve of the pattern’s arm hole.",
      "content": "Measure along the curve of the pattern’s arm hole. Place the starting (zero) end of the tape measure at the top of the arm hole stitching line, just beneath the seam allowance. Extend the tape down along the curve until you reach the bottom seam allowance. A seam allowance is the area between the cut edge of the fabric and the sewing line. [8] X Research source It doesn’t change the size of the opening, so avoid including it in your measurement. Stand the tape measure on its side and make sure that the tape follows the stitching line precisely. Avoid measuring along the outer edge of the arm hole on the pattern. That measurement doesn’t accurately reflect the dimensions of the eventual hole."

      "title": "Take a measurement from the back pattern piece.",
      "content": "Take a measurement from the back pattern piece. Locate the stitching line on the back pattern piece. Place the starting end of the tape measure at the top of the arm hole stitching line. Then, wind it down the curve until it reaches the bottom of the arm hole. Remember to avoid including the seam allowances in your measurement. Doing so skews the results."

      "title": "Add the front and back arm hole measurements together.",
      "content": "Add the front and back arm hole measurements together. The sum of the 2 measurements gives you the total arm hole measurement. The back arm hole measurement might be larger than the front by 1/2 inch to 5/8 inch (1.25 to 1.6 cm). If the measurements are off by more than this amount, the balance is off. The back arm hole measurement is never smaller than the front."

      "title": "Consider the ease to make sure your finished garment is properly fitted.",
      "content": "Consider the ease to make sure your finished garment is properly fitted. The ease refers to extra fabric added to a garment to make it more comfortable and allow ease of movement. [9] X Research source Alter the total arm hole measurement as needed to allow for ease of movement in the final piece. If you're working with a pattern drafted for woven fabrics and want to make a garment with a knit fabric, shorten the ease by 1/2 inch (1.25 cm). Convert a knit pattern for use with woven fabrics by lengthening the ease by 1/2 inch (1.25 cm). If you added some slack when you took the measurement, avoid adding extra ease here."

      "title": "Adjust the arm hole size as needed before cutting and sewing the fabric.",
      "content": "Adjust the arm hole size as needed before cutting and sewing the fabric. The simplest way to adjust the arm hole size is to make the curve of the arm hole deeper or shallower. Make the curve deeper if you need the arm hole to be bigger. Make it shallower to make the hole smaller. [10] X Research source To alter the arm hole, sketch a deeper or shallower curve onto the pattern using your arm hole measurement. Then, line a French curve up with your sketched line to even it out. [11] X Research source Avoid altering the shoulder or side seams to change the arm hole measurement. Keep in mind, the bases and top points of the arm hole on the front and back pattern pieces must match up. When you alter the arm hole size of a pattern, remember to alter the shoulder opening of any sleeve you plan to attach so the 2 measurements match."
