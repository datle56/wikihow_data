Try to pop bubbles so there’s only 1 left for your opponent. As soon as they push the last bubble down, they lose and you win! [5] X Research source Example: There are 3 bubbles left in one row and 1 bubble left in another. If it’s your turn, you can press down all 3 bubbles in the first row so the other player has to pop the last one."
