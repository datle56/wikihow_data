If the passwords didn't work or if your search returned no results, then you may be able to reset the password by removing and reinserting the CMOS battery. [2] X Research source The CMOS battery looks like a watch battery, and it powers the motherboard even when the computer is unplugged. This might be how the password is stored on your motherboard along with the system time and your computer's BIOS settings. Removing and reinserting the battery will clear all of these settings."

You may be able to perform this method on a laptop as well, but it will require removing the protective case from the back of laptop. You will usually need to remove all of the other panels as well as the battery to get access to the motherboard."
