      "title": "Write a \"Hello World\" program.",
      "content": "Write a \"Hello World\" program. This is usually the first program to write in any language, and it just prints \"Hello world\" to the screen. Write the following code in any text editor and save it as helloworld.f . Pay attention that there must be exactly 6 spaces in front of every line. program helloworld implicit none character * 13 hello_string hello_string = \"Hello, world!\" write ( * , * ) hello_string end program helloworld"
    },
    {
      "title": "Compile the program.",
      "content": "Compile the program. To do this, type f77 helloworld.f into the command line. If this gives an error, you probably haven't installed a Fortran compiler like for example gfortran yet."
    },

      "title": "Run your program.",
      "content": "Run your program. The compiler has produced a file called a.out . Run this file by typing ./a.out ."
    },
    {
      "title": "Understand what you just wrote.",
      "content": "Understand what you just wrote. program helloworld indicates the start of the program \"helloworld\". Similarly, end program helloworld indicates its end. By default, if you don't declare a variable type, Fortran treats a variable with a name that begins with a letter from i to n as integer, and all others as a real number. It is recommended to use implicit none if you don't need that behaviour. character*13 hello_string declares an array of characters which is called hello_string . hello_string = \"Hello, world!\" assigns the value \"Hello, world!\" to the declared array. Unlike in other languages like C, this can't be done on the same line as declaring the array. write (*,*) hello_string prints the value of hello_string to the standard output. The first * means to write to standard output, as opposed to some file. The second * means not to use any special formatting."

      "title": "Add a comment.",
      "content": "Add a comment. This isn't necessary in such a simple program, but it will be useful when you write something more complex, so you should know how to add them. There are two ways to add a comment. To add a comment that has an entire line on its own, write a c directly into a new line, without the 6 spaces. After that, write your comment. You should leave a space between the c and your comment for better readability, but this isn't required. Note that you have to use a ! instead of a c in Fortran 95 and newer. To add a comment in the same line as code, add a ! where you want your comment to begin. Again, a space isn't required, but improves readability."

    {
      "title": "Understand different data types.",
      "content": "Understand different data types. INTEGER is used for whole numbers, like 1, 3, or -3. REAL can also contain a number that isn't whole, like 2.5. COMPLEX is used to store complex numbers. The first number is the real and the second the imaginary part. CHARACTER is used for characters, like letters or punctuation. LOGICAL can be either .true. or .false. . This is like the boolean type in other programming languages."

      "content": "Get the user's input. In the \"Hello world\" program that you wrote before, getting user input would be useless. So open a new file and name it compnum.f . When you've finished it, it will tell the user whether the number they entered is positive, negative or equal to zero. Enter the lines program compnum and end program compnum . Then, declare a variable of the type REAL. Make sure that your declaration is between the beginning and the end of the program. Explain the user what they're supposed to do. Write some text with the write function. Read the user's input into the variable you declared with the read function. program compnum real r write ( * , * ) \"Enter a real number:\" read ( * , * ) r end program"

      "title": "Open a new file.",
      "content": "Open a new file. Since this concept is different, you'll have to write a new program again. Name the file addmany.f . Insert the corresponding program and end program statements, as well as an implicit none . When you're finished, this program will read 10 numbers and print their sum."

      "title": "Declare an array of length 10.",
      "content": "Declare an array of length 10. This is where you will store the numbers. Since you probably want a sum of real numbers, you should declare the array as real. You declare such an array with real numbers ( 50 ) (numbers is the name of the array, not an expression)."

      "title": "Declare some variables.",
      "content": "Declare some variables. Declare numSum as a real number. You will use it to store the sum later, but since sum is already taken by a Fortran expression, you have to use a name like numSum. Set it to 0. Declare i as an integer and don't assign it any value yet. That will be done in the do-loop."

    {
      "title": "Create a do-loop.",
      "content": "Create a do-loop. The equivalent of that in other programming languages would be a for-loop. A do-loop always starts with do . On the same line as the do, separated from it by a space, is the label to which the program will go when it's finished. For now, just write a 1 , you'll set the label later. After that, again only separated by a space, type i = 1 , 10 . This will make the variable i , which you had declared before the loop, go from 1 to 10 in steps of 1. The steps aren't mentioned in this expression, so Fortran uses the default value of 1. You could also have written i = 1 , 10 , 1 Put some code inside the loop (indent with spaces for better readability). For this program, you should increase the variable numSum with the i-th element of the array numbers . This is done with the expression numSum = numSum + number ( i ) End the loop with a continue statement that has a label. Type only 4 spaces . After that, type a 1 . That's the label which you told the do-loop to go to after it finishes. Then, type a space and continue . The continue expression does nothing, but it gives a good spot to place a label, as well as showing that the do-loop ended. Your do loop should now look like this: do 1 i = 1 , 10 numSum = numSum + numbers ( i ) 1 continue"

      "content": "Print numSum. Also, it would make sense to give some context, for example \"The sum of your numbers is:\". Use the write function for both.

Be aware that using the more aggressive optimization option can introduce errors in complex codes and may even slow things down! Test your code."
