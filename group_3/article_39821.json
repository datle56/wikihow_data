You can start on either one or two skis however it might be easier to start on two while you get use to being pulled out of the water and begin to build forearm strength in order to hang on to the rope. Many people go straight to one ski."

Usually, your dominant foot corresponds with your dominant hand. However, this is not always the case. [1] X Research source To figure out your dominant foot, have someone push you from behind lightly, but hard enough to make you stick out a foot to regain balance . The foot that you stick out in front of you is your dominant foot, and should be in the back of the ski. Make sure that you aren't expecting the push!"

      "title": "Start out with the bar.",
      "content": "Start out with the bar. Starting on the bar is a good idea because it lets you figure out how to balance on one ski. Get up on two skis, and drop the one with your dominant foot in it. You can drop a ski while on the water by pressing down with your toe. Your foot should slide right out. Making the boot a little larger than usual helps get it out easily, and so does dousing the inside with soap before you start. Whenever you want to drop a ski, try to choose a spot in particular so you and the driver knows where it has been dropped. Firstly, you want to shift your weight on one ski (the side you want to slalom on which is your dominant side) After that, try slipping out of your boot. The boot should be usually looser so you don't have to struggle it out. whenever you have your foot out of the boot but still keeping that foot slightly in so when you are comfortable you can completely let go of the ski and take your time to pull back your foot behind and onto the other ski. Do not rush, it's your first time, you want to set up a momentum so that you can do it over and over again. Once you get your dominant foot out, carefully slide it into the back boot of your non dominant foot. At first, this procedure will be difficult and awkward, but you'll soon be able to do it like it's nothing."

It will be tricky to keep your balance, however, if you're comfortable doing this on the bar, this should be a fairly easy task. Once you've done that, it's time to move on."

[3] X Research source If your right foot is in the front of the ski, the rope should be on your left. If your left foot's forward, put it on your right. This will help you keep your balance before getting up. Keep your ski centered. The boat should be going around five miles per hour (eight kilometres per hour), which will help you keep your balance. Once you are certain you've found your inner balance, call out to the driver so they know to start. Have them speed the boat around thirty miles per hour (forty eight kilometres) until you get up and are steady, then gradually slow down to around twenty miles per hour (thirty two kilometres)."

You can turn to go out of the wake by using your back foot to lean to the direction you'd like to go in. You'll have to push a lot at first, but with some practice, you'll be able to turn easily with less than a slight movement of the foot. Practice over and over, and cut as hard as you can while going outside of the wake. See how much spray you can kick up with your back foot. [4] X Research source"
