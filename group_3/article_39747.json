      "content": "Warm up your voice. [1] X Expert Source Tanisha Hall Vocal Coach Expert Interview. 27 March 2020. Try an exercise called elevator slides as a great way to warm up your voice and reduce vocal cord injury. Make a noise that sounds like a long, slow siren while making an “ah” sound. Start out as low as you can go, ascend to as high as you can, and go back down. [2] X Research source Repeat this several times, experimenting with different vowel sounds, such as “ee” and “ooh.” Keep your throat relaxed, especially as you get to the high notes, to help the notes not catch in your throat. If your voice still sounds stiff, consider that outside factors like being nervous about singing in front of a new teacher might be impacting your sound rather than technique itself. In that case, try to resolve the emotional stories interfering with your voice. [3] X Expert Source Jonathan Stancato Voice Coach Expert Interview. 31 March 2020."

      "content": "Take a slow, deep breath in. Fill your lungs with air just like you normally would, except keep going to allow your lungs to really expand. Try to inhale through your nose, and take your time to get a good solid breath. [4] X Research source Try not to make any sound when breathing in. Inhaling slowly will help you avoid making a sound. If you can hear yourself taking your breath in, there is tension in your breath. This tension will be audible in your out-breath while you're singing."

      "title": "Keep your diaphragm expanded to support your voice throughout each note.",
      "content": "Keep your diaphragm expanded to support your voice throughout each note. To find out where your diaphragm is, put your hands firmly around your waist and cough. The muscle that pushed your hands out is your diaphragm. When you take a deep breath, your diaphragm expands; it should stay expanded throughout the duration of the phrase you're singing until it's time to draw a new breath in. [5] X Research source Try keeping your hands around your waist when you're starting out, to be sure that you're supporting your voice with your diaphragm."

      "title": "Sing from middle C and up two octaves to see if you have a soprano voice.",
      "content": "Sing from middle C and up two octaves to see if you have a soprano voice. Soprano is the highest range of the female voice. To see if you fall into this range, play a middle C on a piano or keyboard and match the note with your voice. Do the same thing for all notes up to the C two octaves above middle C. [6] X Research source Coloratura sopranos, a subset of the soprano category, are actually able to sing the third F above middle C and sometimes higher. If you are unable to strongly hit the highest C, you may be a mezzo-soprano."

      "title": "Try the G below middle C and up two octaves to A for a mezzo-soprano voice.",
      "content": "Try the G below middle C and up two octaves to A for a mezzo-soprano voice. Mezzo-soprano is the mid-range female voice. They are often supporting or villainous roles in operas, though some French operas have lead role mezzos. [7] X Research source Use a piano or keyboard to try and match the mezzo notes to determine if this is your voice range."

      "title": "Sing the F below middle C to the F one octave above it for contralto and countertenor voices.",
      "content": "Sing the F below middle C to the F one octave above it for contralto and countertenor voices. Contralto is the lowest female voice range, and countertenor is the highest male range; these ranges consist of almost the exact same notes. The only difference is that countertenors generally cannot hit the lowest F, so that range actually starts from the G below middle C and goes up an octave to F. [8] X Research source True contralto voices are so rare that contralto roles are often given to mezzo sopranos. Countertenors often use a falsetto, or head voice, technique to reach their high notes. If you're a female with a low voice, or a male with a high voice, you may fall into these voice ranges. Use a piano or keyboard and try to match the notes to find out. To increase the lower end of your vocal range, think about relaxing your voice rather than moving towards vocal fry as an alternative to that deeper sound.

      "content": "Try the C below middle C to the C above it to see if you have a tenor voice. Tenors usually have the male lead roles in opera. Like the other voice ranges, there are subset categories within the tenor range that are more particular for different types of roles. [10] X Research source Lyric tenors are able to easily hit the highest notes in the range, and generally get roles of charming young men, whereas dramatic tenors generally are most comfortable in the middle of the range and get robust, muscular characters for roles."

If you're a male and have a pretty low singing voice, try to match the low notes on a piano or keyboard to find out if this is your range. [12] X Research source"
