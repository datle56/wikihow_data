      "content": "“Septum arms” is used to describe a woman who's cute \"except them arms.\" The implication is that the woman has fat or unattractive arms. The phrase “septum arms” was created by TikTok’s AI “blue text” search function at the top of a video by @orlandospeciality shaming people who criticize women’s bodies. TikTok’s quickly changing lingo made people speculate that it’s an insult for women with fat arms.

      "content": "“Septum arms” is used jokingly in a similar way as “butter face.” A woman who is a “butter face” has an attractive body, but her face (butter face) is unattractive. With septum arms, someone is attractive, ‘cept them arms. [2] X Research source “Did you go on a date with that girl last night?” “Yeah, but she was such a butter face. No wonder her profile didn’t have any good selfies.” Some people think that “septum arms” refers to arms that are larger above the elbow than below, the triangle of skin that expands at the tricep when you rest your arm against your body, or just arms that are “ugly.” “Vuvuzela arms” is a similar TikTok nonsense term created by TikToker @superkeara to comment on micro insecurities people pick up online. Unfortunately, like septum arms, people misinterpreted it as a real insult. The term refers to arms that are thinner at the wrist than they are further up the forearm. The joke is that this is the shape of almost any person’s arm."

      "content": "The term originates from an anti-body-shaming video. In the original video (which has since been removed) TikTok user @orlandospeciality plays two characters; one mouths the phrase “Omg ew, bro look at her arms,” and the other looks at the first character in disgust and shakes his head “No.” [3] X Research source The video was captioned “This world is full of sick people.” The video, which has been parodied and remade several times, uses the audio “Falling Down (Bonus Track)” by Lil Peep."

      "content": "TikTok’s AI highlighted “septum” and “arms” because of a comment. TikTok user @daryldixonisaw commented “What if it’s someone with a septum?” which quickly gained over 27,000 likes. [4] X Research source TikTok’s algorithm highlights terms users may want to search and choose “septum arms” for this video. @orlandospeciality has openly shown his distaste for septum piercings and made other videos with “Septum” in the title, so the algorithm was primed to think “septum” was a term that users would be interested in."

On July 17th, 2024, TikToker @kirkiimad posted a parody video , using the text “Omg eww bro look at her septum arms🤢.” [5] X Research source On the same day, user @nuumuhuupi posted a video asking what the term meant, cementing the meme and starting the trend of trying to decipher the phrase. Unlike the original video, the parodies all include the actual phrase, septum arms."

Due to a growing movement of body shaming and “niche insecurities” on TikTok, people assumed that the phrase was an insult. Since negative attention aimed towards women’s bodies trends so often, people quickly jumped to the conclusion that “septum arms” was another trend.

      "content": "Body positivity TikTokers claimed the phrase soon after its creation. Within the body positivity movement, there has been a push to reclaim terms, like fat, so that people have the ability to describe their bodies accurately without the social stigma of treating fact like insult. [8] X Research source In the case of septum arms, the movement more claimed the term than “reclaimed” it. TikTokers like @steyrmiu have been criticizing this reclamation, saying that terms like “septum arms,” “hip dips,” and “legging legs” are terms created and popularized by the very women who are victimized by them."
