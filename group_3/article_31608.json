[1] X Research source This virus encrypts the files on your computer and gives them the \".null\" file extension. If you attempt to open these files, you'll be prompted to pay a hefty ransom. The only way to get rid of this computer virus is to run a scan and follow the on-screen instructions to remove the corrupted files and malicious code. Never pay a ransom to access to your files. You'll most likely end up paying a ransom and still be left with encrypted files. If you only have one NULL file, it's likely an innocent file that was generated when an app you installed encountered an error. Still, it doesn't hurt to run a scan to rule out threats."

This will attempt to display a plain text version of the NULL file in your text editor. If the file is a jumbled mess, it's not a text file. It's possible it's some sort of media file—you can try using a media player like Final Media Player or VLC Media Player to open it. You may want to use some sort of universal file viewer if the text editor doesn't work. Since a file ending with .null isn't going to be important to any apps, it's likely safe to delete."
