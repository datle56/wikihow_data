      "title": "Select the right product.",
      "content": "Select the right product. The right product for you will depend on your needs. For instance, some dye-removal and leather cleaning products are intended for light-colored leather. Other products are meant only for suede, while others are meant only for automobile leather. Dye removal products are designed to remove dye and ink stains from leather. They might be able to clean dye stains caused by blue jeans dye, newspaper print, fresh ballpoint ink, paint, shoe polish, and permanent marker from leather. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Follow the manufacturer directions.",
      "content": "Follow the manufacturer directions. Leather is a sensitive material. In order to avoid damaging your leather, read manufacturer directions carefully before utilizing any cleaning product on your leather. Do not use your leather cleaning product in a way that is not recommended. All products intended to remove dye from leather are a bit different. It is therefore impossible to give specific directions regarding use. Generally, though, you’ll need to apply a bit of the cleaning product to a rag, then wipe the dye away using the rag. [7] X Research source Some products might direct you to scrub the leather with steel wool, a horsehair brush, or sandpaper after applying the dye-removal product."

    {
      "title": "Test the product.",
      "content": "Test the product. Before you commit to a particular dye removal product, test it on your leather object in an out-of-sight spot. For instance, if you’re cleaning a leather jacket, don’t wipe the product across the arms and back of the jacket. If the cleaning product has an adverse reaction with your leather jacket, you will ruin the whole jacket. Instead, test the cleaning product on a small portion of the jacket that will not be regularly seen. For example, you might wipe the product on a small area on the inside of the jacket and observe its effect."
