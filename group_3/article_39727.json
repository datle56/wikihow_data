      "title": "Hugging yourself",
      "content": "Hugging yourself can relieve a lot of tension. Start by putting left hand on your right shoulder or upper arm, and your right hand on your left shoulder or upper arm. Lightly rub your shoulders with your hands, then squeeze yourself. Hold this position for about a minute, and repeat it whenever you feel like you could use another hug. [1] X Research source You can also wrap your arms around your midsection if you prefer. Whichever position is most comfortable for you is the best way to hug yourself. While you’re giving yourself a hug, you can also say a positive affirmation to yourself out loud, like “I am worthy.”"

      "content": "A weighted blanket can provide you comfort and security. Most people find weighted blankets that are about 10% of their body weight to be most soothing.

      "content": "Body pillows are great substitutes for cuddle partners. Many people find the sensation of hugging a body pillow as they go to sleep to be extremely comforting.

[3] X Research source As a replacement for a body pillow, try hugging a normal pillow. Just the feeling of holding onto an object as you sleep can be pleasant. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Massaging your own body can reduce touch-starvation.",
      "content": "Massaging your own body can reduce touch-starvation. For example, studies have shown that the vagus nerve that extends from your brain to your digestive tract plays a large role in stress and anxiety. Massage it by placing your index fingers behind the bottoms of the backs of your ear. Then, use your index fingers to massage the backs of your ears and your thumbs to massage the front. Finish by flipping the back of your ear over to cover your ear canal and applying gentle pressure. Using a massage roller can help you massage your back and other hard-to-reach areas. To massage your feet, you can also step on a tennis ball and gently move your foot back and forth. [6] X Research source If you don’t mind spending some money, a professional masseuse can really help you with feeling touch-starved."

      "content": "A furry companion is a great replacement for a human partner. Spending time with a pet can bring you deep feelings of intimacy, ones that help you deal with loneliness.

      "title": "Exploring your body can show you how you can meet your own needs.",
      "content": "Exploring your body can show you how you can meet your own needs. While cuddling releases chemicals like oxytocin and reduces stress, so does masturbation. Being slow and deliberate with how you pleasure yourself can ease a lot of the symptoms of touch starvation. [10] X Research source Try touching parts of your body that you might not normally, like the back of your neck or ears. Be curious about your own body. Sex toys can also help you explore your own capacity to bring yourself pleasure. Experimenting with these toys can bring you a lot of sensations that you might miss from not cuddling in a while."

      "title": "Your memory can actually stimulate your touch receptors.",
      "content": "Your memory can actually stimulate your touch receptors. Research has shown that when we think about moments that we’ve been touched, our memory simulates this feeling in other parts of our body. So close your eyes and think about the last time you were cuddled—let yourself imagine this moment in full detail, and you might find some of your cravings for cuddling to be satiated.
