      "content": "Know that you must focus equally on context and visual cues as the actual lips. Only 30-40% of sounds in the English language are noticeable by sight. Too many of our words and syllables are so similar that you can't actually just tell them by lip reading alone. Most lip-readers will tell you, at the end of the day, that lip-reading isn't actually reading. The words aren't so simple, and tics, mumbling, accents, and mouth covering all make straight \"reading\" impossible. Once you learn to make lipreading a part of your communication, not the only tool you have, you will be much more successful. At Better Hearing Australia's annual lip reading competition, most people score only 40-50%. The few who hit 90% and higher do so through context, context, and guess work."

      "content": "Lipread sentences, not single words. Trying to pick up every single word is going to be hard, and you'll struggle mightily. Most lip-readers know that long words and sentences are easier to read than short ones because longer phrases allow you to fill in the blanks through context. By focusing on the whole sentence, you can comfortably miss a few words here and there and still understand what was actually said. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Check in to facial movements and expressions to understand tone and mood.",
      "content": "Check in to facial movements and expressions to understand tone and mood. The eyes and mouth are incredibly expressive -- often more so than your tone of voice. Don't just look at someone's lips, as the rest of their face offers important contextual clues to determine not only the sentence but how the sentence is said. Tugging at the lips (small grimaces or smiles) often indicate worry, fear, or anxiety. Raised eye brows also tend to indicate anxiety or stress. Furrowed brows and foreheads indicate displeasure or anger. Creases around the edges of the eyes indicate happiness and excitement. Cocking the head to the side usually indicates discomfort or even slight hostility. Looking down shows nervousness, shyness, or an unwillingness to communicate. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Study body-language and posturing to learn from non-verbal cues. You're trying to translate one sense (sound) into another (sight), and this is an inherently impossible task to perfect. The best lip readers use everything to their advantage, including body language, to gauge mood, tone, and themes of conversation. While imperfect, this list covers many of the basics: [3] X Trustworthy Source HelpGuide Nonprofit organization dedicated to providing free, evidence-based mental health and wellness resources. Go to source Closed off arms tend to indicate anger or aggression. Open arms indicate friendship, closeness, and honestly. Open and closed legs have similar connotations. The way a person's shoulders and hips point often indicate their priorities or who they are most comfortable with. Leaning towards you implies intimacy and connection. Leaning away generally indicates discomfort or confusion. Big, expansive posture implies confidence, strength, and dominance. Slouching shows a lack of confidence . There is a lot of nuance, subtlety, and interpretation involved in body language, and every situation is different. But, used with lip reading, you can learn a lot very quickly in most situations.

Unfortunately, only a third of them are visually different.The following list of sounds can get tricky, as they have similar mouth shapes when formed, or are frequently confused.

But this is far more effective then harping on every word and sound. Many lip readers know they need to take a second to \"re-construct\" the sentence before responding, allowing them to speak more fluidly and skip over issues.

The point of a chat isn't to impress someone with your skills, but to actually talk to someone! Slower, better enunciated words will be much easier to read and pull context from."

      "content": "Watch TV and focus on how people's lips move when they talk. Start with the news, as you'll have clear speakers who are looking right at the camera every single time. If you have partial hearing, turn the volume up and listen along -- you'll be able to attach the \"sounds\" to the lip motions. If you are completely deaf, turn the closed captions on and use them to guide your lip reading."

Slow down and try out tricky syllables or related sounds (like p, b, and m) to get used to the combination of word and visual. By saying the words out loud as you read, you help internalize the syllable for future lip reading. [8] X Research source"

To improve your daily lipreading skills, start with your friends. Let them know you're working on lipreading, and that they can help by speaking clearly, slowly, and looking straight at you. As you get better, ask them to speed up to normal conversational pace. [9] X Research source"

You may feel nervous, but just remember that very, very few people are going to get angry, upset, or otherwise negative when they find out you're lip reading. Communication is a two-way street -- and people will be willing and happy to help you learn and repeat sentences you've missed."
