A different name may be confusing to people who aren’t familiar with Discord, but people who use it regularly will know what you’re referring to.

      "content": "Shorten the name to “disc” or “cord.” Rather than trying to type out the full word, just cut it in half when you mention it. You could say something like: “What’s your disc?” “You should join my ‘cord.” “Do you have disco?”"

      "content": "Copy and paste the characters at the end of a server link. Instead of trying to send a Discord link, check the URL for the string of characters after the forward slash. Copy the characters into the chat and send them. This works best if you’ve already been chatting or have mentioned Discord in another way so the person doesn’t think you’re sending random letters and numbers."

Because a lot of Roblox players are under 13, moderators block mentions of other third-party sites. This helps prevent underage users from seeing inappropriate content or visiting unmoderated sites."

Bans usually last 1 to 7 days before you can log in again, but your account may be locked permanently if it happens repeatedly or if Roblox detects other inappropriate behavior.
