      "content": "Go for a short, gentle walk to encourage your bowels to move . Walk for 15 minutes in the area around your home, but only if you feel comfortable with this level of activity. Walking will encourage the muscles in your bowels to work, which helps relieve constipation and bloating and encourage flatulation.

      "content": "Do leg-raising exercises that help you pass gas . Lie on your back and place a pillow under your knees. Then, slowly raise your right leg towards your stomach with your knee bent and hold it there for 10 seconds. Lower your leg after 10 seconds and repeat this exercise with your left leg. These leg raises will contract and expand the muscles in your abdomen, helping to move gas through your digestive system. Repeat this exercise 2-3 times a day until your discomfort is gone."

      "content": "Apply a heat pack to your abdomen for 15 minutes to ease gas pain . Wrap the heat pack in a towel so that you don’t apply it directly to your skin. Placing a heat pack against bare skin can cause numbness and even minor injury. [5] X Research source Note that while applying a heat pack will help relieve your gas pain, it may also increase any swelling you’re experiencing after your surgery. You can apply a heat pack as often as necessary to stimulate your abdominal muscles. However, avoid applying heat for more than 20 minutes at a time and give yourself a break of at least 20 minutes between applications to allow your body to cool back down."

      "content": "Take pain medication as prescribed by your doctor. Your healthcare provider may want you to take a particular prescription pain reliever, especially if you have post-surgery pain in your shoulders. Avoid taking any pain medications that your doctor doesn’t prescribe, as some pain relievers may cause additional constipation. [6] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source Some pain medications also cause nausea . If you experience any nausea, tell your doctor at once and see if you can be switched over to a different medication. To avoid potential constipation caused by medication, make sure you drink plenty of fluids and eat fiber-rich fruits and vegetables. Keep in mind that some pain medications can also worsen gas and increase the time it takes for your bowel habits to get back to normal."
