      "content": "Review the overall context of the conversation. Think about what you just said, and try to pinpoint what specifically may have offended the other person. As difficult as it may be, focus on separating yourself from the heat of the moment. It’s perfectly normal to feel defensive and upset at this type of accusation, but lashing out won’t help de-escalate the conversation at all. [1] X Research source It can be easy to say things you regret if you don’t give yourself a moment to step back and breathe."

      "content": "Try not to view the statement as a personalized attack. “Racist” isn’t a term that was crafted just for you. Remember—you aren’t the first person to be labeled with this term, and you definitely won’t be the last. At the end of the day, you can’t control what people say and believe. However, you can make a choice to engage in calm, informed discussion that doesn’t escalate into something worse. [2] X Research source Instead of becoming defensive, try to view the situation from a curious, compassionate standpoint. Does the other person have a valid point? How can you explore this subject and learn from it? [3] X Expert Source Jessica Elliott, ACC, CEC Certified Executive Coach Expert Interview. 7 October 2021."

      "content": "Apologize if your words unintentionally offended another person. It can be tough to apologize, especially if you don’t think you’re in the wrong. As tricky as it may be, try to separate yourself from your own thoughts and feelings and view things from the other person’s perspective. Even if you didn’t mean for your words to sound racist, they may have sounded that way to another individual. Instead of jumping to your own defense, take a moment to acknowledge how the other person is feeling. [4] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Business Review Online and print journal covering topics related to business management practices Go to source For instance, you can say something like: “I’m very sorry—I didn’t realize my statement sounded racist, and I didn’t mean to offend you.”"

      "content": "Ask if the person is willing to explain their perspective. Instead of dwelling on the negative emotions you may be feeling, use the conversation as a learning experience for the future. Politely ask the other person if they’d be willing to give you a quick run-down about how to better choose your language next time. Depending on the situation, the other individual may not have the time or energy to give you an explanation, which is perfectly fine as well. [5] X Research source You can say something like: “Would you mind helping me understand how my comment was hurtful? I’d like to do better in the future.”"

Emphasize that you’ve learned a lot from the conversation, and that you appreciate their honesty and directness.

Racist accusations are really frustrating, especially you’re labeled as “racist” over a conversation that has nothing to do with race. At the end of the day, you know in your gut that your statement was not intended to be racist. While it’s a tricky pill to swallow, it’ll be best for your mental health if you put the incident behind you instead of dwelling on it. [7] X Trustworthy Source Pew Research Center Nonpartisan thinktank conducting research and providing information on public opinion, demographic trends, and social trends Go to source For example, if you tell someone that they’re frequently late to work and they respond by calling you a racist, you can know for sure that the accusation is false."

Accusations of workplace bullying can be really serious, and it’s best to get them sorted out as soon as possible. Explain what happened in detail to your manager or Human Resources (HR) representative, so they can figure out the appropriate steps to take moving forward. [8] X Research source Sometimes, these accusations may happen because of miscommunication. An HR rep or manager can help iron out this conflict and reach a mutually peaceful resolution."

      "content": "Clarify what the term “racism” means. While “racist” isn’t a complimentary term, the phrase on its own doesn’t mean that you’re a hateful, awful person who throws slurs around willy nilly. Instead, the term refers to any attitude or thought pattern that discriminates against another racial group, even if it’s unintentional. Try viewing the term in a broader sense, instead of viewing it as a personalized attack against yourself. Racism isn’t always obvious. Many instances of racism aren’t outright attacks, but jokes and statements that support the idea that some groups of people are somehow better than others. [9] X Research source"

      "content": "Review common terms used by social justice groups. If you’re not a fan of political movements and rhetoric, you may be tired of hearing certain terms and phrases on the news. Regardless of your political leanings, it can help to review these terms so you can have an independent understanding outside of racially-charged discussions. Review the definitions of terms like “anti-racist,” along with terms like “institutional racism” and “individual racism.” This can help you be better equipped for future conversations! [10] X Research source Anti-racism refers to any person who takes an active stand to fight against racism. Individual racism occurs when people accidentally or unknowingly spread racism through their independent thoughts and beliefs. Institutional racism is racism that occurs on a larger, widespread level, like in a workplace."

      "content": "Examine different instances of privilege in your life. Contrary to popular belief, the concept of privilege isn’t targeting your accomplishments and achievements. Instead, the concept of privilege refers to natural, basic things that you don’t have to worry about because of your race or background. Try to think about some of the ways your privilege benefits you, and how that privilege may naturally impair your attitude towards the rest of the world. [11] X Research source For instance, a privileged person doesn’t have to worry as much about having the police called on them. The idea of tan band-aids being considered “flesh-toned” is a casual example of white privilege."

Despite all the news reports and protests, it’s important to remember that racism isn’t a political platform—it’s a human rights issue. As an anti-racist, you can make a positive difference by holding others accountable, and using your privilege to help disadvantaged groups.

Additionally, make an active effort to consume media written by minority groups, which can help broaden your horizons.
