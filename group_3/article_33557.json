      "content": "Gather at least 2 players and choose someone to go first. You need 2 or more players to play I Spy, but there's no limit on how many people can play a game. Anyone can play I Spy, and you can play it anywhere, but if you’re playing with very young players, take a look at our tips below. Then, choose someone to go first. Here are some ways to choose: [1] X Research source [2] X Research source Select the oldest person, or the youngest person. Choose the player whose birthday is coming up next. Choose the player whose name is first alphabetically, or last. Or, take volunteers!"

      "content": "Tell the player who’s “it” to pick an object they see in the room. The player who’s “it” is the spy! The spy looks around the room and chooses an object that anyone can see. Make sure that once they’ve picked it, they ** don’t say what it is!] [3] X Research source It’s a secret! Take your time choosing, and find some interesting things about the object, like its size, color, or where it is in the room. Once you’ve found an object, keep looking around the room for a little bit before saying that you’re ready. That way, it’s not super obvious which object you’ve picked. If you’re teaching a class, have the spy whisper the object in your ear so you can help them answer other player’s questions, if needed."

      "title": "Say “I spy with my little eye something…” and give a hint.",
      "content": "Say “I spy with my little eye something…” and give a hint. The spy starts the game by giving a clue. They say, “I spy with my little eye something that’s ____,” and fill in the blank with their clue. Make it a small clue that doesn’t give it away, but lets other players take a good guess. For example, if you spy a soccer ball, you might say, “I spy something round!” Here are some other good hints you might give: [4] X Research source The shape of the object The size of the object If the object is heavy or light What the object feels like What part of the room the object is in. Is it up high? Down low? What the object is made of . What noise the object makes."

      "title": "Let each player guess what the object is.",
      "content": "Let each player guess what the object is. After the spy gives the hint, the other players have a chance to look around and find the object. Then, go around the group and give each player a chance to guess what object you chose. [5] X Research source The spy gives a yes-or-no answer to each clue. For example, if someone asks, “It is the stuffed moose?” the spy would either say “yes” or “no.” If a guess was close to or similar to the chosen object, the spy says the guess was warm (close) or hot (very close). If a guess was nowhere near the object, the spy says cold, or cool if the guess was mostly off."

      "content": "Give everyone another hint if they haven’t guessed it. If none of the players guess the object, the spy repeats the phrase “I spy with my little eye something ____,” and gives everyone another hint. Choose a different hint this time, and focus on a different feature of the object. [6] X Trustworthy Source American Library Association Oldest library nonprofit association in the world, dedicated to promoting libraries and library education internationally.

When a player does guess correctly, that player becomes the new spy, and the game starts over. [7] X Research source If nobody is able to guess the object, give more obvious hints. For example, if you chose a soccer ball, say, “I spy something you kick.” If all the players are young and not able to easily guess, consider having a set order in which everyone gets to be the spy."

      "content": "Select an object the child is familiar with. Settle in with the child somewhere comfortable and free of distraction. Pick a household object, such as a toy, utensil, or stuffed animal whose name the child has learned. Place the object down in front of the child on the mat, floor, or tray. [8] X Research source In this version of the game, the object isn't to get the child to guess what object you’ve chosen, but rather to encourage the child to come up with the name of the object you’ve put down. This game also works for older children who are in the process of learning a new language, and the game can be used as a learning exercise for foreign words. In order for this game to work, the child needs to have already begun learning the names of different objects, because the game is used to reinforce that knowledge."

      "content": "Give the child a hint using the concept you’re teaching. Just like if you were playing with older children, say the rhyme to give the hint. For this version of the game, focus on letters, and specifically the first letter of the object. As the child progresses and gets better with names and spelling, you can try going by the last letter of the object too. For instance: [9] X Research source “I spy with my little eye, something that starts with the letter S” for a spoon “I spy something and it ends with the letter G” for a toy dog Or, use shapes, colors, descriptive adjectives, or numbers. Tailor the hint to the concept you want the child to learn."

      "content": "Ask the child to guess the name of the object. Gently and enthusiastically ask them if they know what the object is. Say, “What do you think I’m spying?” or, “Can you guess what it is?” This game only works with familiar objects because the child already has to have learned what the objects are in order to be able to name them. [10] X Research source If the child needs some more help, begin sounding out the name of the object one letter at a time. For the word “spoon,” for example, sound out just sp first, then \"spoo…\", until the child is able to come up with the word. Offer a lot of praise if the child guesses correctly, and plenty of encouragement if they have trouble. Say, “Good job! That’s exactly what I was thinking of!”"

Choose one particular object that you want the child to identify and name, and then say the rhyme and give the beginning letter. Make sure all the objects start with a different letter. Another advanced version is to lay down five or six objects, two or three of which start with the same chosen letter, and have the child identify and name all the objects that start with that letter. As the child’s perception improves, you can stop placing objects down and start using objects in the immediate environment."

For a less competitive and more explorative game, reward students for giving answers that fit the clue, even if it’s not the object you were thinking of. For example, you might say, “I spy something round.” One student might say a ball, and the other says a balloon. In this version, they’re both right! [11] X Research source The aim here is to cast a wide net and encourage learning basic concepts by applying them to many different possible answers."

[12] X Research source This helps students learn to interpret art, and gives them a chance to take pride in each other’s creations."

When you play I Spy with a young child, or even older students, it presents opportunities to rope in new concepts related to the ones you’re teaching.
