      "title": "Connect the rope to a tow hitch.",
      "content": "Connect the rope to a tow hitch. If you are pulling a stuck vehicle out of sand, mud or snow from the back you may choose to attach the rope to the vehicle at the tow hitch. Run the rope around the tow hitch, but not the ball itself. Instead, wrap the rope around the entire hitch and hook it to itself. If the tow rope does not have a hook, use a bowline knot to secure it. Rope may slip off the tow hitch if you secure it only to that. Most tow ropes are three to five feet in length. You do not want a very long rope when towing a vehicle with another, as it can make managing the towed vehicle difficult."

      "title": "Secure the rope to the frame.",
      "content": "Secure the rope to the frame. Many trucks have tow hooks or loops on the frame itself. If that is the case, run the rope through the loop and hook it to itself. If the vehicle does not have tow loops, find a part of the frame to secure the rope to that will not interfere with the wheels turning. The frame is the most structurally rigid component of the vehicle. Attaching the rope to other parts could risk tearing them off or warping them. The cross member beneath the engine may be an appropriate area to attach a tow rope in your vehicle. Refer to the service manual for your specific vehicle if you are unsure of where to locate portions of your frame that are exposed. Do not attach the rope to the axle of the vehicle. The frame is the only portion of the vehicle you should use when towing it with a rope."

      "title": "Move the vehicles apart slowly to pick up the slack.",
      "content": "Move the vehicles apart slowly to pick up the slack. Once the rope is attached to both vehicles, pull the tow vehicle away slowly to pick up all the extra slack in the rope. It’s important to start towing with the rope taught. If the tow vehicle pulls away with slack in the rope it will subject the towed vehicle to a large amount of force very abruptly. [1] X Research source Have a friend keep an eye on the rope and provide direction to the driver of the tow vehicle."

      "title": "Put a driver in both vehicles.",
      "content": "Put a driver in both vehicles. While pulling a vehicle with a rope, it is imperative that you have a driver in each vehicle. Have a friend drive the tow vehicle while you steer the vehicle that is being pulled, or vice versa. [2] X Research source Keeping a driver in both vehicles will allow for the most control in the situation. If the towed vehicle can start, start it and keep it running while being pulled."

    {
      "title": "Drive the tow vehicle slowly.",
      "content": "Drive the tow vehicle slowly. Regardless of the distance you need to pull the vehicle, proceed at a low speed. If the vehicle being towed cannot start, it may not brake consistently, so maintaining a low speed will reduce the likelihood of it failing to stop if need be. [3] X Research source Driving slowly is the only safe way to pull a vehicle with a tow rope. Be extremely careful driving slowly while towing another vehicle on public streets."

      "title": "Use a winch.",
      "content": "Use a winch. If you have access to a winch, it is the easiest way to pull a vehicle with a rope a short distance without using a second vehicle. Secure the winch to the frame of the vehicle using the supplied mounting hardware, then attach the rope on the other side to a solid, immovable object. Wrap the winch line around a tree that is at least a foot in diameter then hook it to itself. You may also use rocks or guardrails to attach your vehicle. Use the controls on the winch to pull the vehicle."

    {
      "title": "Tie the vehicle to a tree with a long rope.",
      "content": "Tie the vehicle to a tree with a long rope. If you do not have a winch, you may be able to pull a vehicle far enough to get it unstuck using a long rope and a group of friends. Secure the rope to the frame of the vehicle, then tie the other end to a strong tree. [4] X Research source You will need at least twenty feet of rope between the vehicle and the tree. Ensure the rope is taught between the two. A bowline knot will support the weight required and still allow you to untie the rope when you are done."

    {
      "title": "Gather a group of friends.",
      "content": "Gather a group of friends. You may be able to pull a small vehicle out of whatever it is stuck in with only one or two friends, but larger vehicles will require more friends to assist. Gather a group of as many friends as you can before you start to ensure you are able to pull the vehicle. [5] X Research source The more friends you gather, the easier it will be. Ensure you have plenty of extra rope so there’s enough room for everyone to assist."

      "title": "Tie a rope around the midpoint in the tow rope.",
      "content": "Tie a rope around the midpoint in the tow rope. With the rope taught between the car and the tree, tie a second rope around the midpoint between the two. If the rope is too close to the tree or the car, this method will not work. [6] X Research source If you have enough rope, you can simply wrap it around the midpoint and use both ends to pull from. If you do not have enough rope to wrap it around the midpoint, tie it to the other rope with a bowline knot ."

    {
      "title": "Pull on the perpendicular rope.",
      "content": "Pull on the perpendicular rope. On the count of three, have all of your friends pull the rope you tied around the midpoint in the tow rope. Pulling in such a manner will dramatically increase the leverage you place on the vehicle and allow you to pull the vehicle a short distance. [7] X Research source Pulling from this angle will allow you to pull a car you would not otherwise be able to pull."

    {
      "title": "Ensure your rope is strong enough.",
      "content": "Ensure your rope is strong enough. When purchasing a rope to pull a vehicle, the most important thing to look for is the strength of the rope. Most ropes in retail stores will indicate on the packaging what the maximum amount of weight the rope is rated to pull without failing is. Use your vehicle’s owner’s manual to determine the weight of your vehicle and choose a tow rope rated for that weight. [8] X Research source Most tow ropes that can be purchased at auto parts stores are sufficient to pull normal sized cars or trucks. Do not use a rope if you aren’t able to determine its maximum strength rating."

      "title": "Assess what level of control the towed vehicle will have.",
      "content": "Assess what level of control the towed vehicle will have. If the vehicle you are pulling will start, but cannot drive, it is best to start it and allow it to run as you pull it. This will allow you to utilize the power steering and brakes. If the vehicle will not start, insert the key and turn it so the accessories come on and the steering wheel unlocks. [9] X Research source Some vehicle’s brakes will not function properly without the vacuum created by the engine running. The vehicle will not have power steering without the engine running."

    {
      "title": "Determine the distance you will need to tow.",
      "content": "Determine the distance you will need to tow. If you need to pull a vehicle just a few feet, there are fewer concerns you will need to address before getting moving. If you need to pull the vehicle to your house or a repair facility you will need to assess the vehicle’s ability to cover that distance safely. [10] X Research source If the vehicle will not start, it is not safe to tow it a long distance. Without power steering or brakes the towed vehicle may crash into the tow vehicle. If you need to pull a vehicle out of mud, snow or a ditch, you will only need to pull it until it can move under its own power."

      "title": "Find out the laws in your area.",
      "content": "Find out the laws in your area. If you intend to pull a vehicle with a tow rope on public streets, you will need to determine if it is legal to do so. Check into the laws in the region you will be towing the vehicle through in order to determine if it is legal to do so. [11] X Research source Laws in the United States vary from state to state regarding towing a vehicle with a rope. In some places it is illegal to tow a vehicle with a rope at all."
