The process will differ for each site, service, or app, but you'll usually find the option to set up a new device in your Security or Authentication settings. Some services will display a QR code or a key that you can enter into the Authenticator app on your phone to reset it. Don't forget to check all your devices to see if any are still logged in. For example, if you logged in to YouTube on your PC or Mac, you may be able to access your security settings there."
