      "content": "Set up a step stool next to the painting site. Before you start painting, you will want to make sure that the spot you plan on painting is easily accessible. If necessary, set up a small step stool or ladder to help you reach the area that you'll be painting. Being closer to the corner will allow you to make steadier, more confident strokes. This can help make your paint job look more professional. If you're using a ladder, always have a person nearby to spot you. This can help to prevent any potential injuries."

[7] X Expert Source Andres Matheu Commercial Painter Expert Interview. 28 July 2020. Choose a starting point along the edge and ensure that the piece of tape is long enough to reach the corner. [8] X Research source Make the piece of tape longer than necessary to ensure that the corner’s edges are completely covered. [9] X Research source Medium adhesion painter’s tape is a good choice for painted walls, and will help prevent any damage to the wall during the tape removal process. Using a painter's tape applicator can help to make the taping process much more efficient. They are available at most stores that sell painting supplies.

      "content": "Secure the painter's tape to the wall with a putty knife. Drag the putty knife along any loose sections of painter’s tape so that they adhere tightly to the wall. Once you have securely bonded the tape to the corner, use a utility knife or other small blade to cut off anything extra. [12] X Research source A one and a half inch wide putty knife is a good size for most painting projects."

Secure this piece of tape with the putty knife. [13] X Research source Since you already cut the extra tape off of the first strip, the second strip will be easier to secure to the wall and corner. [14] X Research source Apply long strips of painter’s tape around nearby moldings as needed. This process will be identical to the rest of the taping process."

      "title": "Begin to fill the corner with paint.",
      "content": "Begin to fill the corner with paint. Use a two-and-a-half inch wide brush and liberally dip into the paint. Start by using your brush to apply paint from the innermost crevice. This will make it easier to paint the areas immediately surrounding the corner. If you are painting near a baseboard, be sure to have drop cloths or plastic sheeting laid out to prevent any paint from spilling on the floor. [15] X Research source If you prefer to use a roller in your painting, consider using a square paint edger. This tool is a mix of a brush and a roller, and will help you reach the inner parts of the corner. Use an extension pole if necessary. [16] X Research source"

      "content": "Spread the paint in outward strokes. You will want to keep your brushstrokes short so that you can spread the paint evenly across a small area. Aim to paint at least five short strokes from your initial paint placement. Edge rollers can also be effective in providing consistent paint coverage along a straight line. [17] X Research source"

      "content": "Keep brushing in short strokes to hide any brush marks. Given the small amount of painting space in a corner, there is a chance that you have lingering brush marks that are visible to the naked eye. Give extra care to even out parallel strokes of paint with perpendicular ones."

You will then want to pull the tape off in a clean, steady motion. Ideally, you will want the tape to be forming a 45-degree angle as you remove it from the wall. [18] X Research source"
