      "title": "Palm oil production is uniquely problematic for trees and forests.",
      "content": "Palm oil production is uniquely problematic for trees and forests. Palm oil cultivation requires a lot of land. Roughly 27 million hectares of land are used for palm oil production, and much of that land is used to contain healthy natural forests. Read labels at the grocery store to make sure that the products you buy don’t contain any palm oil. [2] X Research source Palm oil is often found in makeup, shampoo, noodles, chocolate, laundry detergent, ice cream, baked goods, soap, and bread. [3] X Research source If you do need to buy a product with palm oil in it, make sure that you’re buying from a company that’s making an active effort to source their palm oil responsibly. [4] X Research source You may need to do some research on specific companies, but as a rule of thumb, it’s safer to buy products made in countries with stronger environmental regulations."

      "content": "The less paper you use, the fewer trees will be needed. While paper production requires continuous planting of trees, the amount of energy and resources that go into making paper is hardly good for the environment. [5] X Expert Source Kathryn Kellogg Sustainability Specialist Expert Interview. 28 June 2019. Whenever possible, find ways to reduce the amount of paper you use. Whether it’s cardboard, printer paper, or paper cups, look for alternatives to commonly-used paper products. [6] X Research source Paperless billing is a great way to cut back on the amount of paper you inadvertently create. Bring a reusable mug with you to the coffee shop and ask them to pour your coffee in there. Get a reusable water bottle to cut back on the need for paper and Styrofoam cups at the office. Used or reclaimed wood furniture is often cooler than the new stuff anyway, and it’s a great way to avoid waste. Buy used books or get an e-reader so that you don’t need to purchase paperbacks hot off of the press. If you’ve got to move, borrow or rent plastic bins instead of buying cardboard boxes."

      "content": "If you need to pick up some paper products, buy responsibly. Read the packaging carefully to see if it’s made out of recycled materials, and seek to buy products from sustainable companies. [7] X Expert Source Kathryn Kellogg Sustainability Specialist Expert Interview. 28 June 2019. It’s great if you recycle on your own, but if you don’t support the manufacturers who use your recycled paper, it becomes a lot harder for those businesses to justify the additional cost. [8] X Research source It can be hard to figure out if a company’s claims that their paper is recycled are accurate or not. You may need to do some independent research on certain brands to see if they actually use recycled paper. In general, products that say they’re “made from 100% recycled materials” are more trustworthy than other, vague claims. Just to give you a sense of how much of an impact you can have here, we can save 250 million trees a year just by recycling our newspapers!"

      "content": "People often avoid cloth alternatives to paper, but it’s a worthwhile tradeoff. Cloth is always preferable to paper since you can wash and reuse it. Sure, you’ll need to use some water to clean it, but it beats using paper products over and over again if you want to save the trees! [9] X Research source It takes 17 trees to make a ton of paper towels, but you can always use cloth napkins. [10] X Research source Tissue paper is made out of tree pulp, but a washable handkerchief is better and more sustainable! [11] X Research source The average child requires over 8,000 disposable diapers, but cloth diapers can be reused over and over again. It may seem icky at first, but it’s worth it if you want to save as many trees as possible. [12] X Research source Get yourself a few washable totes and use those instead of the paper and plastic bags that stores use."

      "content": "Participating in town hall and city council meetings is a great way to go. Making your voice heard in local government will let them know this is an issue that matters to you. It’s also a great way to push for actionable changes where you live. It may not change things on a global scale, but if everyone were to push for greener, tree-friendly spaces where you live, it would make a massive change! You can always write your local lawmakers if you can’t show up in person to make your voice heard. A lot of cities and townships have tree planting services where people can ask for a tree to be planted in your yard or on your street. If your city doesn’t have a service like that, you could push for them to start one."

From deforestation watchmen groups that monitor local lumber companies to make sure they’re behaving responsibly, to smaller local groups that plant trees and pick up trash, there’s sure to be some kind of volunteering opportunity near you. [13] X Trustworthy Source Science Direct Online archive of peer-reviewed research on scientific, technical and medical topics Go to source Looking online and reaching out to local groups on social media is a great way to get leads on volunteering opportunities near you. If you can’t get out to volunteer yourself, don’t sweat it! You could consider donating to a nonprofit organization that focuses on saving and protecting trees.

      "title": "Factory-raised animals require a ton of space to graze.",
      "content": "Factory-raised animals require a ton of space to graze. This often involves tearing down acres upon acres of forests and woodlands to make space for all of the animals. By cutting back on your meat consumption, you’ll be reducing the demand for all of those animals. You don’t need to go full-blown vegan if you don’t want to, but swapping out that steak for fish or fresh veggies on occasion will help protect the trees out there. [15] X Research source Meat production also requires a lot of energy. If you’re also concerned about global warming and the health of our planet, cutting back on red meat is a great way to help. If you live near rural woodlands and are comfortable firing a gun (or bow and arrow), you can look into hunting wild deer and consuming their meat like venison. Although you still have to kill an animal to get the meat, this is much more natural, healthy, and environmentally appropriate than raising animals on factory farms."

If you’re looking at raw lumber for a home improvement project or you’re picking up a new furniture-making hobby, buy wood that has the FSC stamp of approval. [16] X Research source A lot of irresponsible lumber companies tear down protected forests to produce wood products. By purchasing from responsible manufacturers, you promote safe and sustainable practices!"

Bonus points if it’s a local news article that’s relevant to the place where you live. A lot of people don’t even know how important trees are and the more educated people are, the more likely they’ll be to pick up the torch and help fight to save the planet. [17] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source If you need talking points, you can point out the following: [18] X Research source Deforestation and tree removal speed up global warming by trapping more greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Tree removal and deforestation often damages the communities that live in those areas. It takes a lot of gas, chemicals, and energy to remove natural woodlands. Trees help clean the air that we breathe, and the more trees you destroy, the harder it becomes to fight back against pollution."

      "content": "It seems like an obvious way to help, but there is some nuance here. You’ll have to do some research on the native trees in your area since you shouldn’t plant anything that won’t thrive. You’ll also need to check your local laws and check with your utility companies before you dig to make sure any yards or public spaces can support a tree. There’s also the maintenance! You’ll need to take care of the tree after planting it to make sure that it grows healthy and strong. [19] X Research source Planting a tree in your yard can be a lot of work, but it’s going to dramatically improve the air that you breathe. You’ll also have some shade whenever you want it! [20] X Trustworthy Source US Department of Agriculture U.S. agency responsible for promoting good agricultural practices and protecting consumers Go to source If you do not have the resources or space to plant a tree, you can still get many planted in your area by contacting your city's public works department. There is also a project called Team Trees that was started by large YouTubers including Mark Rober and MrBeast and that aims to plant one tree for every dollar donated to their fundraiser."
