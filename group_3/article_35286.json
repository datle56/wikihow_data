      "content": "Start with one of the Gospels to read Jesus’ story and teachings. The Bible’s ultimate message is the story and teachings of Jesus Christ, told in a set of books called the Gospels. If you’re just starting out reading the Bible, go with these first. There are four Gospels. They overlap in parts but have differences, too: [1] X Research source Matthew alternates stories of Jesus’ life and sections which provide his teachings. These provide context relating Jesus to prophecies in earlier Biblical books. Mark is a fast-paced account of Jesus’ life. This dramatic narrative culminates in the crucifixion. Luke has larger blocks of stories and teachings. It focuses on Jesus’ relationship with people. John is often set apart from the other (Synoptic) Gospels. It focuses on the character of Jesus and contains stories not told in the others."

      "content": "Pair the New Testament with the Old to get the Bible’s whole message. The Bible is divided into two main parts. The Old Testament covers events and teachings before the birth of Jesus. The New Testament discusses his life, teachings, and first followers. You don’t have to treat them as truly separate parts, however. [15] X Research source For instance, each day you can read a chapter from the Old Testament, and one from the New. You could instead read one whole book from the Old Testament. Then read one from the New Testament, then back to the Old, and so on. This technique is most useful if you are trying to read the whole Bible in a certain amount of time, and want some variety rather than reading cover to cover."
