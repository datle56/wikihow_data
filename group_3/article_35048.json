      "content": "Search for your minifigures on the internet to check prices. Check popular secondhand LEGO sites, like eBay and Bricklink , to see how much other people are charging for their versions of your minifigures. This will give you a ballpark figure for what yours are worth. The fewer minifigures LEGO produces in a single run, the rarer and more expensive they are in the future. For example, the original Yoda minifigure wearing an \"NY I Heart\" shirt that LEGO gave out at Times Square goes for thousands of dollars at auction because LEGO only produced 1000 of that unit for that specific event. Regular, non-rare minifigures can cost anywhere from $0.99 used on eBay to $8.99 for a new minifigure on Amazon ."
