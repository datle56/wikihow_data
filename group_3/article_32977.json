      "content": "Gather a group of 2 to 10 people and choose someone to be “it.\" This game works best with a small to medium-sized group of people, so that everyone gets a chance to ask a question. Choose a random player to be “it.” This could be the youngest player in the group, the player who’s had the most recent birthday, or something silly, like who can eat a piece of pizza the fastest. [1] X Research source If the group is too big, like more than 15 people, you may reach the end of the game without giving everyone a turn. This is a great game to play on a road trip or with a group of friends to pass the time. It’s also a great way to break the ice with a group of people that you’re just getting to know! Reader Poll: We asked 2887 wikiHow readers and 49% of them agreed that their favorite way to break the ice when meeting new people is by asking funny or silly questions to lighten the mood [Take Poll] ."

      "content": "Think of a person, place, or thing for other players to guess if you’re “it.” Think of someone or something that you know enough about to answer some basic questions about, and keep it a secret! If you choose a person, they can be living, deceased, or even fictional. Make sure you choose a person, place, or thing that most people in your group know about. [2] X Research source For example, your item could be “Marylin Monroe,” since she is famous enough that most people will be able to make guesses about her. You could also choose something like New York City, the Eiffel Tower, or even clouds or the sun. Avoid items like “my mom” or “my dog” unless you are with your siblings or best friends, since the players might not know enough about them to guess."

      "content": "Ask yes-or-no questions if you're not \"it.\" If you’re not “it,” your goal is to figure out what the “it” person is thinking of by asking questions to narrow down the possibilities. Try using a fairly general opening question that can be answered with “yes” or “no” to narrow down your options. For example: [3] X Research source “Is it alive?” “Is it an object?” “Is it fictional?” “Is it bigger than a toaster?"

      "content": "Take turns asking more specific yes-or-no questions to narrow it down. You can ask questions in any order that you’d like, but make sure each player gets to ask at least 1 question. If a player asks a question that can’t be answered with “yes” or “no,” ask them to rephrase it so that it can be, since the person who’s “it” can only say “yes” or “no.” [4] X Research source For example, a player couldn’t ask, “How old are they?” or “What do they look like?” They could ask, “Are they older than 50?” or, “Do they have blonde hair?” Think about the questions that have already been asked before you ask new questions. For example, you could go from \"Is it a person?\" to \"Is it a man?\" to \"Are they alive?\" to \"Do they live in America?\""

If you think you know what the answer is, use 1 of the group’s 20 questions to guess! But if the group reaches 20 questions and they haven’t guessed the person, place, or thing, the person who’s “it” reveals what it is. [5] X Research source For example, you might ask, “Is the answer Marilyn Monroe?” If you’re right, the group wins! If you’re wrong, it counts as 1 of your 20 questions."

If no one guessed the person, place, or thing at all, whoever wants to go next can have a turn. Keep the game going until everyone has had a chance to be “it.” [6] X Research source If someone guesses correctly but they’ve already been “it,” let someone else have a turn instead.

      "content": "Use some classic questions to find the answer more quickly. As you play, it’s best to make your questions gradually more specific to really zero in on the answer. The questions you ask will depend on what you’ve asked already and what you’ve already found out, but also ask some time-honored questions that veteran players often use to find the answer more efficiently. If it’s a person: Are they real? Are they still alive? Are they a man? Has anyone here met them? Are they an artist of some kind? If it’s a place: Do we need a plane to get there? Is it in this country? Is it hot? Is it a famous place? Is it crowded? Have you been there before? If it’s a thing: Is it an animal? Is it a vegetable? Is it a mineral? Is it bigger than a breadbox? Is it food? Is it rare? Would it be expensive to buy? Is it in this room?"

That usually means picking something that everyone’s at least somewhat familiar with. Here’s a handy list of possible answers, if you need a little inspiration: People: George Washington, Lady Gaga, Beyoncé, Paul Newman, Katniss Everdeen, Mario or Luigi, Rosa Parks, Keanu Reeves, Spiderman, The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Christina Aguilera, Bob Marley, Elton John, or Gandalf. Places: Your classroom, Paris, the Coliseum, Disneyland, a library, a certain cafe, under the bed, Washington D.C., outer space, a local toy store, a sports stadium, Yellowstone National Park, Stonehenge, Montana, or Margaritaville. Things: A computer, a sweater, a glass of water, a quilt, a concert ticket, spaghetti, coffee ice cream, a mirror, music, Van Gogh’s Starry Night, a banjo, a candle, a magnifying glass, a country’s flag, a certain type of tree, a cardboard box, or a website."

Double-check that the person, place, or thing and the subject card are related, or offer suggestions if your student can’t think of anything.

Also, help the student who’s “it” to understand the question with alternate phrasing if they’re confused. [10] X Research source Let students raise their hands when they have a question, or go around the room in a circle or spiral.
