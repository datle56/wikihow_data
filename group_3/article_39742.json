      "title": "Switch singing from your chest to falsetto.",
      "content": "Switch singing from your chest to falsetto . Justin has a vocal style that switches often between the chest, or normal singing range, into falsetto. Falsetto is higher pitched and tends to come through your throat and nasal passages. When you sing in falsetto, it may often sound like you're making a little boy voice. This will help to hit some of the high, soft notes in Justin's music while being able to quickly shift back to singing from the chest. When you're practicing your falsetto, sing very softly, then increase your volume gradually. Your vocal cords are like rubber bands, and singing higher stretches them, so it's important to be very gentle with that part of your voice. [2] X Expert Source Tanisha Hall Vocal Coach Expert Interview. 22 April 2020. Try singing the chorus on \"As Long As You Love Me.\" Notice how Justin switches from his chest voice to falsetto and back to his chest voice while saying the word love."
