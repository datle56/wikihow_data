If you’re worried about potential spills or missing the opening of the bottle, place a pee funnel against your body to direct the stream into the bottle. Just be sure to clean the funnel when you’re finished! [1] X Research source You can find pee funnels at your local sports and outdoors shop. You can also order them online. If you’re in a pinch, you could make a cone with a sheet of paper to act as a makeshift funnel."

      "content": "You don’t want to run out of room while you’re still going. While it can vary from person to person, most people pee about 2 cups at a time. The last thing you want is an overflow situation, so make sure you choose a bottle that can hold enough liquid. Go with as wide of a mouth as you can to avoid potential messes. A sports drink bottle such as a Gatorade bottle will often have a wider mouth than a water bottle. [2] X Research source If you’re using an empty drink bottle, it’ll usually list how much volume the bottle holds on the label. It can be tougher to “aim” for smaller openings on bottles. Avoid using a glass bottle, which often have much smaller openings. Steer clear of cans as well, which have edges that could potentially cut you—which is something nobody wants happening."

      "title": "Make aiming as easy as possible to avoid messes.",
      "content": "Make aiming as easy as possible to avoid messes. When you’re ready to go, get into a position that allows you to hold the opening of the bottle right next to your body. For guys, that may be a kneeling position, and girls may want to take a comfortable squatting position, especially if you’re in a cramped space such as a vehicle or tent. [3] X Research source If you’re driving a car, pull over so you can safely go to the restroom. Don’t try to go while you’re driving or it could lead to spills—or worse, a car accident. It might be helpful to climb into the backseat to give yourself more room to use the bottle."

      "title": "It can help prevent spills and overflows.",
      "content": "It can help prevent spills and overflows. With the bottle in position close to your body, slowly start to pee, making sure you’re making it into the bottle. Keep the bottle held so the bottom is tilted toward the ground or floor. That way the liquid doesn’t quickly overfill the bottle or potentially flow back toward you and create a mess.

      "content": "Keep it closed up nice and tight until you can dispose of it. Once the deed is done, try to quickly close the lid to help keep the smell contained. Keep the bottle stored away until you can properly dispose of it. [5] X Research source If the bottle doesn’t have a lid or you don’t want to keep it stored, you can empty it out somewhere such as the side of the road. But don’t litter and leave the bottle behind!"

      "content": "Reduce the spread of germs that could get you sick. There’s a reason why washing your hands after going to the bathroom is important: you’ll get rid of germs that can make you and others sick. Use some hand sanitizer or a sanitizing wipe to wash up when you’re finished. [6] X Research source If you have access to it, use soap and water to wash your hands."

      "content": "You don’t want there to be any potential mix-ups. Take a marker and make some kind of identifying marking on the bottle such as an “X.” You could even write something like “Do not drink.” Just clearly mark the bottle so that you or another person don’t accidentally use it or drink from it. [7] X Research source You may want to keep the bottle stashed away out of sight as well. Just to be safe."

Leaving bottles full of pee on the side of the road is not only gross, in many places it’s illegal and you could face a hefty fine for it. Wait until you come across a dumpster or trash can you can use to properly dispose of the bottle. [8] X Research source You don’t want to pollute the environment or force someone else to have to pick up your bottles."
