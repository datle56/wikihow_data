      "content": "Pick and sterilize the correct tool to cut the bamboo. The tool you use will depend on how thick and hearty your bamboo is. If you have thin bamboo, you may be able to use a sharp knife. If your bamboo is heartier, you may have to use a handsaw. Whatever tool you end up using, sterilize it first with household disinfectants, such as diluted bleach or rubbing alcohol. [1] X Research source If you are using bleach to sterilize your tool, dilute it with water first. Use 1 part bleach for every 32 parts water. For example, use 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of bleach for every 1/2 liter (0.13 US liquid Gallon) of water or 4 fluid ounces per US Gallon."

      "content": "Apply 1 ⁄ 8 inch (3.2 mm) of soft wax around the rim of the exposed end. Use a soft wax, like soy wax or beeswax. The wax will help prevent the stalk from rotting or drying. Make sure you do not cover the center hole with wax. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Bury the cutting 1 node deep into a pot filled with potting soil. A small nursery pot will work fine for each cutting. Push the bamboo into the potting soil until 1 node is completely buried. Press the soil firmly around the bamboo to eliminate any air pockets present. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Fill the center of the cutting with water. While the roots will develop with moist soil, pouring water into the center of the stalk will give extra water to your cutting. Check the water level every 2 days and keep the center mostly filled with water as it grows. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Keep the pots in a warm area out of direct sunlight and water them daily. The bamboo cuttings should be kept in mostly shade while it grows, but a little light throughout the day is okay. Check the soil daily to keep it moist. Don’t let water sit on top of the soil. Too much water will put any developing roots at risk of rotting. [8] X Research source You can place a plastic bag over the cutting to help the plant retain moisture, though this is not necessary for it to grow."

After it’s been in the pot for 4 months, you can transplant the cutting into the ground. [9] X Research source Gently loosen the soil in the pot with a hand shovel or trowel so it can be easily removed. Place the bamboo into a hole slightly larger than the bamboo root system. Replace the soil around the bamboo and water it thoroughly."

Keep the bamboo in an area where it gets indirect sunlight for 6 hours and is above 55 °F (13 °C). [11] X Research source If possible, use a clear container so you can see the roots develop."

Find a portion of the rhizome that has 2 or 3 growth buds, or the areas where stalks grow from. You may have to trim the stalks down to collect the rhizome. Use a sharp knife to remove the portion. [13] X Research source Don’t use any rhizomes that have a dark or patchy appearance. These are signs of disease or pests. Thus, such rhizomes will not grow as well. Only collect rhizomes from an established bamboo clump, or else you put your existing bamboo at risk."

If it feels dry, water the rhizome until the soil is damp, but not drenched. Too much water will cause the rhizome to rot. Do not overwater the soil."
