      "content": "Calculate your tree’s diameter and add 6 inches (15 cm). Inspect your tree carefully to find the thickest point near the bottom 1–3 ft (0.30–0.91 m) of the trunk. Take a cloth measuring tape and wrap it around your tree. Divide this number by pi (3.14) to get your diameter. Add 6 inches (15 cm) to that measurement and write it down. [1] X Research source Round your numbers up to the nearest whole number to make things easier. For example, if the circumference of your tree is 89 inches (230 cm), divide it by 3.14 to get 29.34 inches (74.5 cm). Round this number up to 28 inches (71 cm) and write your base number down as 34 inches (86 cm). The extra space will prevent the tree from breaking your bench in the event that it grows at an odd angle. If your tree is on the younger side and you expect it to grow over the course of the next 10-20 years, add 12–18 inches (30–46 cm) to the diameter. This process will result in a 6-sided bench, which is ideal for wrapping around a tree without leaving a ton of variation in the amount of open space between your bench boards and the trunk."

      "content": "Divide the diameter by 1.75 (4.5 cm) to find the length of your interior bench boards. Your tree bench will be made out of a sequence of parallel boards that wrap around your tree in a hexagon. To calculate how big you’re going to make your interior bench boards, divide your base measurement by 1.75 (4.5 cm). Write this length down on a scrap piece of paper. Round any numbers up to the nearest whole number to make things easier. [2] X Research source For example, if your base length is 34 inches (86 cm), divide it by 1.75 (4.5 cm) to get 19.42 inches (49.3 cm). Round this up to 20 inches (51 cm) to make things easy."

Use your measuring tape to measure out the length you’ve just calculated. Use a carpentry pencil to put hash marks at the bottom of one side of the board’s length. [3] X Research source These hash marks indicate the length of your interior board, closest to the tree. For the wood, make sure that you get hardwood, like pine or oak, that has been thermally-treated to protect it from the elements."

Pivot the speed square until you have a 30-degree angle pointing away from the center of the board. Draw a line through the board using the speed square as your straight edge. Repeat this process on the other side. [4] X Research source This should look like a trapezoid with the lines leading away from you."

      "content": "Cut your interior boards using a miter saw. Put on some protective eyewear and some thick gloves. Plug your miter saw in and adjust the angle of the saw by moving the guideline on the base of the saw until it reads 30-degrees. Place your first board flush against the plate of the saw. Turn the saw on and slowly lower the blade into the line that you drew to trim the board. Repeat this process on the other 11 lines that you’ve drawn. [5] X Research source You have to flip the board around after every cut since the lines you’ve drawn lead away from the center."

Then, set one of the boards on a stable surface with 30-degree cuts pointing away from you. Lay 3 boards lengthwise above the piece that you cut. Insert 1 ⁄ 4 – 3 ⁄ 4 in (0.64–1.91 cm) spacers in between the boards to separate them a little. The size of your spacers will determine how much space is in between each board. So long as this distance is less than 1 in (2.5 cm) but more than 0.1 in (0.25 cm), your bench will be structurally sound. Put at least 2 spacers between each board to ensure that the boards are separated evenly."

Adjust it so that the edge of the cut interior board is flush with the edge of the scrap piece of wood. Use your carpentry pencil to extend the angle that you cut through the 3 boards above it. Repeat this process for the other 11 lines that you’ve drawn. Once you finish extending the lines of an interior board, set the pieces aside and a new set of 3 boards for each interior board. [6] X Research source If you don’t have a ton of space, make a note in the middle of each board to indicate whether it belongs in the first, second, third, or fourth layer of your bench. If you do have plenty of room, set the boards aside in the proper order to keep track of your layers. You’re essentially extending the 30-degree angle out from your interior board by tracing its path."

Set each piece of lumber underneath the blade and use it to make plunge cuts along each of your lines. Cut each piece to size the same way you did when you were cutting the interior boards. With all of your boards cut, set your pieces out on the ground or a large table and check to make sure that all of your boards fit together in a hexagon."

Use a measuring tape and speed square to mark off 12 hash marks at a 90-degree angle on the board. Put 12–18 in (30–46 cm) between them based on how tall you want the bench to be. Adjust your miter saw to cut at 90-degrees and trim the board into 12 lengths. [7] X Research source The length of these boards will determine how high your bench is. You can make it a little taller or shorter if you’d like, but most tree benches are 12–18 inches (30–46 cm) tall. Keep in mind that the bench boards will add a little height as well. You will attach 2 legs to each corner of your hexagon-shaped bench."

Put a second bracer on top of the 2 legs and the first brace and hold it in place. Clamp the pieces together to hold them still.

Put heavy objects against both sides of each leg to keep them still. [10] X Research source Don’t worry about being super precise. You’re going to adjust the location of the legs after you lay your boards on top. You’ll probably end up making multiple adjustments until the bench boards are laying correctly."

Push the legs in a little so that there is a 1 ⁄ 2 in (1.3 cm) of space between the front of the bench and the leg underneath. [11] X Research source Take a good look at the structure once you’re done. Look underneath to ensure that the angle where the bench boards meet is the center of each leg and that your boards are spaced out evenly before moving on. Put your spacers back into each of the boards to ensure that they’re evenly spaced out on every side. This is tricky since nothing is holding the boards in place. Take your time and work slowly.

You’ll finish the last section when the bench is around the tree. This will be a total of 40 pilot holes. [12] X Research source A pilot hole is a small hole that you drill into a piece of wood to create threading for a screw. It also prevents the wood from splintering when you screw into it."

Continue drilling until the screw is flush with the surface of the board. Screw all of your boards into place, leaving 1 side unsecured.

If you attempt to lift the bench on your own, it may break under the odd distribution of weight from the unsecured side.

On uneven sides, use a garden spade to remove the dirt underneath the legs until the bench becomes level. [14] X Research source Skip this step if you’re installing the bench on a paved or gravel surface. The bench is going to shift and settle over time as the legs compress the soil underneath, so it’s never really going to be perfect."
