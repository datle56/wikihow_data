      "content": "Meaning of the 8th house In astrology, the 8th house rules over intimacy and money. It governs your financial potential, including investments and savings plans. However, due to its connection to Scorpio, the eighth zodiac sign, the 8th house also rules over erotic and romantic chemistry. [1] X Research source The sexual connotations of the 8th house are not predominantly physical; rather, the 8th house represents the deeply intense emotional connection between two people. Traditionally, the 8th house has been seen as a house of death. However, the interpretation of death in modern astrology includes transformation, such as the death of your past self or letting go of a past that held you back."

      "title": "Saturn in retrograde",
      "content": "Saturn in retrograde If you have Saturn as part of your astrological birth chart, you are more susceptible to its effects. When Saturn is in retrograde, you will feel the impact more than others, especially if Saturn is in retrograde in the 8th house. Your introspective qualities will be intensified and you will be fully focused on addressing your limitations and transforming into a new version of yourself. You may choose to shift your habits when it comes to how you connect with others or how you manage your finances. Although this level of change and introspection may feel difficult in the moment, this retrograde is a powerful and transformative opportunity for you. A planet in retrograde means that, from the point of view of the Earth, it appears to be spinning backwards. [4] X Research source Periods of retrograde are thought to be especially potent times that can heavily influence your future life decisions and reflections on the past."

When any planet transits through a house, it empowers that house with its special energy. Whatever area of your life is connected to that house will likely be affected. [6] X Research source Since the 8th house is associated with finances and deep intimacy, Saturn will impact those parts of your life as it transits through your 8th house. You may feel especially introspective about the deeper meanings of life and your intimate relationships, or you may take time to examine and restructure your financial habits."

      "content": "Work and career Having Saturn in the 8th house generally indicates a promising career focused on wealth and financial stability. However, you may face professional obstacles if you have a combust Saturn in the 8th house, meaning that the planet was too close to the Sun at the time of your birth. [12] X Research source In Vedic astrology, a combust planet (in any house) is believed to hinder its positive powers. In the case of a combust Saturn in the 8th house, you may struggle to advance in your career or academic studies. However, having Saturn in your 8th house also makes you an extremely diligent and hard worker, meaning you can overcome these hurdles with dedication and patience. Fully understanding how a combust planet impacts you will depend on its relationship with your ascendant sign, as well as other signs in your birth chart."

[13] X Research source 8th House Saturn + Capricorn: You’re prone to being ambitious and goal-oriented, always working hard and staying focused on achieving your dreams. 8th House Saturn + Aquarius: You may be stubborn, but you are equally efficient and imaginative in your goal of creating a better future for everyone. 8th House Saturn + Aries: You are likely a natural leader who values responsibility and emanates confidence, drive, and a competitive spirit. 8th House Saturn + Libra: You may face challenges in life, but you are extremely tolerant and persistent, always working hard to rise above with strength and humility."

If you put these skills to good use, you may be able to uplift others and help them reflect on their own needs. [14] X Research source You can also use this intuition to help yourself better understand what drives your own behaviors. You may be extremely serious and reserved—while there’s nothing inherently wrong with those qualities, it can make you slow to trust or open up emotionally to others. You sometimes view life as a hierarchy that you want to climb. This trait may make you seem calculated or rigid to others, but you really just crave security and stability. [15] X Research source It’s completely fine to be a more serious or pragmatic person, but make sure to let yourself relax and enjoy life every once in a while!"

While the 8th house is seen as a house of intimate bonding, it’s not connected to passion or sensuality. [16] X Research source While you may consider yourself to be sexually adventurous and enjoy having many partners, you struggle to be emotionally vulnerable or commit to one romantic or sexual partner. Any emotional challenges in your romantic relationships typically improve after your Saturn return, which is when Saturn has gone through its full cycle since your birth—which happens every 29 years. [17] X Research source Remember that the challenges in your birth chart aren’t meant to make you feel bad, but they are meant to show you where you can grow. Work on dealing with your deep emotions and opening up to others about your feelings."
