      "title": "“Not Like Us” is a diss track against Drake.",
      "content": "“Not Like Us” is a diss track against Drake. Drake and Kendrick Lamar have been beefing for years, but their feud really ramped up in early 2024, when they exchanged a flurry of diss tracks over the span of a few months, often releasing songs within the same day. “Not Like Us” is Lamar's fifth official diss track against Drake. The song has been duly praised for its precise and scathing lyrics, in as well as its beat produced by DJ Mustard (but the song's success really comes as no surprise, considering Lamar was the first rapper to win the Pulitzer Prize for music). [1] X Research source The song starts out with Lamar whispering “Psst, I see dead people”—a reference to Shyamalan’s The Sixth Sense , but also a subtle threat to Drake. It’s also a callback to Lamar’s spring 2024 diss track “euphoria,” in which he accused Drake of using A.I. and ghostwriters to write his lyrics and references actor Haley Joel Osment (but confuses him—probably intentionally—with televangelist Joel Osteen), who starred in both The Sixth Sense and A.I. : “Am I battlin' ghost or AI? / N***a feelin' like Joel Osteen, / Funny, he was in a film called A.I. / And my sixth sense tellin' me to off him.”"

      "title": "Lamar criticizes Drake for his alleged groomer behavior.",
      "content": "Lamar criticizes Drake for his alleged groomer behavior. Arguably the most talked-about lyric from “Not Like Us” is “Tryna strike a chord and it's probably A-Minorrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr”—which Lamar holds out for 5 seconds (we counted) and is a reference to both Drake’s over-reliance on the musical key, as well as to his…um…rumored predilection for other types of minors. If you catch our drift. If not, the lyric “Certified lover boy? Certified pedophile” probably clears things up. ( Certified Lover Boy is also the name of Drake’s 2021 album.) Drake has been eyeballed over the years for his seemingly close relationships with very young girls, notably then-teen Stranger Things ’s Millie Bobby Brown, though the two have always denied anything inappropriate ever occurred. [2] X Research source Kendrick’s drawn-out “A-Minorrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr” also mimics Drake’s delivery of “Dave Freeeeeeee’s” in his diss track “Family Matters” (which he released right before “Not Like Us”) in which he suggests one of Lamar’s children was fathered by Dave Free, who’s directed many of Lamar’s music videos."

      "title": "He takes issue with Drake’s use of AI in his music.",
      "content": "He takes issue with Drake’s use of AI in his music. Lamar attacks Drake’s incorporation of AI in his song “Taylor Made Freestyle,” released earlier in 2024, with lyrics like “You think the Bay gon' let you disrespect Pac?” In “Taylor Made Freestyle,” Drake uses AI-generated vocals meant to resemble Tupac Shakur and Snoop Dogg. After Shakur’s estate threatened legal action, Drake removed the song from all platforms. [3] X Research source “The industry can hate me, f*ck 'em all and they mama, / How many opps you really got? I mean, it's too many options” signifies Lamar’s refusal to back down from his fight with Drake even if there are professional consequences. The lyric “F*ck ’em all and they mama” is a callback to a line from 2Pac’s 1996 diss track “Hit ’Em Up” : “F*ck you and yo’ motherf*ckin’ mama.”"

      "title": "He also challenges Drake’s cultural identity.",
      "content": "He also challenges Drake’s cultural identity. Lamar addresses Drake’s dual heritage—his father is African American and his mother is Jewish Canadian—and accuses Drake of being a “colonizer” who exploits Black trauma and Atlanta’s music scene to boost his image and for financial gain. [4] X Research source As Ime Ekpo puts in it Forbes , “Ideally, practitioners of hip hop are members of [African American and African diaspora] communities who not only shape the unique experience associated with hip-hop but also carry the responsibility of curating its customs and trends.” In contrast, Lamar hails from Compton, California, a mainly Black and Hispanic area heavily affected by the crack epidemic, and his music often takes inspiration from his upbringing. [5] X Research source When Lamar chants “They not like us” in the song’s chorus, he’s questioning Drake’s cultural identity and whether he’s of Lamar's caliber—especially given what Lamar sees as a proclivity to rip off other hip hop artists to boost his own career and his alleged sexually predatory behaviors. [6] X Research source Meanwhile, Drake has talked about the challenges of growing up biracial in his own music (like his 2023 song “Wick Man”) and in interviews like this one with The Jewish Chronicle : “I went to a Jewish school, where nobody understood what it was like to be black and Jewish. When kids are young it’s hard for them to understand the make-up of religion and race.”"

      "content": "Lamar also takes shots at Drake’s entourage. Lamar doesn’t stop with Drake, also taking issue with others involved with OVO—that is, October’s Very Own, Drake’s record label, which Lamar ridicules as “OV-ho”—including rappers PartyNextDoor and Baka Not Nice and OVO’s head of security Chubbs: “Chubbs the only one that get your hand-me-downs” implies Drake doesn’t take care of his actual family, only the guys in his entourage. “Party at the party playin’ with his nose now” is a reference to PartyNextDoor’s alleged drug use. “Baka got a weird case, why is he around?” alludes to the 2014 sex trafficking charges against Baka Not Nice. [7] X Research source Lamar is curious why Drake still associates with Baka. The “Not Like Us” album art is an aerial photo of Drake’s mansion with 13 red markers overlaying the mansion, similar to the ones used on maps marking the locations of sex offenders, the implication being that Drake’s entire entourage is full of sexual predators.

Drake responds to “Control” in a Billboard interview, saying, “I didn't really have anything to say about it. It just sounded like an ambitious thought to me. That's all it was…. I know good and well that [Lamar]'s not murdering me, at all, in any platform. So when that day presents itself, I guess we can revisit the topic.” [10] X Research source"

I still got PTSD / Motherf*ck the Big Three, n***a, it’s just big me.” [12] X Research source Cole reacts to \"Like That\" with his own diss track against Lamar, “7 Minute Drill,” on April 5, 2024, but apologizes within a week following its release and removes the song from streaming platforms."

When Lamar doesn’t immediately respond, Drake releases “Taylor Made Freestyle,” incorporating AI-generated vocals meant to resemble 2Pac and Snoop Dogg—two of Lamar’s major influences—to express disappointment in Lamar’s failure to react.

The video is crawling with subtle and not-so-subtle hits against Drake and his crew. [19] X Research source Lamar does push-ups on cinder blocks, a response to Drake’s “Push Ups,” in which he challenges Lamar to “drop and give me fifty.” The owl symbolizes October’s Very Own, Drake’s record label, the logo for which features an owl. Lamar beats an owl piñata with a bat early in the video; at the end, he’s circling a cage containing a live barn owl that’s staring him down, symbolizing Drake himself. At the bottom of the screen during the piñata scene, text reads, “NO OVHOES WERE HARMED DURING THE MAKING OF THIS VIDEO.” “OV-hoes” is Lamar’s insulting nickname for those in Drake’s OVO entourage."

Lamar and DJ Mustard drive through Compton, stopping at Tam’s Burgers #21—which has seen a major uptick in business since the video’s release, unsurprisingly. [20] X Research source Lamar’s appreciation of the left coast is further evident in his accusations of Drake exploiting East Coast rappers like Future, Lil Baby, 21 Savage, Young Thug, Quavo and 2 Chainz in lyrics like, “You run to Atlanta when you need a check balance.” LA is also home to Snoop Dogg, whom Drake sought to emulate using AI-generated vocals on “Taylor Made Freestyle.”"
