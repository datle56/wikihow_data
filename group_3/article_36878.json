      "content": "Remove any baseboards, thresholds, or molding from around the area. Start at the side closest to the damaged board or boards. Carefully pry away baseboards and molding from the wall and pry thresholds up from any doorways with a pry bar. [11] X Expert Source Kevin Schlosser Home Improvement Specialist Expert Interview. 19 February 2021. This method works when the damaged boards are close enough to the edge of the floor that it is possible to remove a small number of surrounding boards to get to the damaged boards and replace them. Try your best not to damage any of the pieces that you pry away so that you can replace them afterward."

      "title": "Lift out the boards starting with the ones closest to the edge.",
      "content": "Lift out the boards starting with the ones closest to the edge. Insert a pry bar under the boards at their seams and press down on the end of it like a lever to pop the joints loose. Work from the edge where you removed baseboards and molding in towards the site of the damage until you can remove the damaged boards. Set aside the boards that are still good, in the order you removed them, so that you can replace them afterward."

Snap the new piece into position. [12] X Expert Source Kevin Schlosser Home Improvement Specialist Expert Interview. 19 February 2021. Save the damaged board so that you can use it for future repairs.

Line up the tongues and grooves, then slide or gently tap them back into place with a hammer if there is a lot of friction. [13] X Expert Source Kevin Schlosser Home Improvement Specialist Expert Interview. 19 February 2021. If you use a hammer to tap any boards into place, use the damaged board you removed as a buffer between the hammer and the good boards to prevent damaging them."

Mark a 1.5 in (3.8 cm) line along a straight edge with a pen or pencil in from each corner of the board diagonally towards the center. Connect the inner ends of the lines with straight lines to make a rectangle that you can cut out from the center of the board. [14] X Research source This method works to replace a single damaged board in the middle of your laminate flooring, where it would be too difficult to replace by removing surrounding boards starting from an edge."

Make another set of holes 1 ⁄ 4 in (0.64 cm) in from the outer ends of the relief lines. Make 8 relief holes in total so that you can cut in 2 phases—1 to remove the center section and 1 to remove the sides."

Lift the blade guard and plunge the saw into the board, starting at 1 of the inner relief holes.

If you use something that could scratch the laminate, like a brick, place a towel underneath to protect it."
