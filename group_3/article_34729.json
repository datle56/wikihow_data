You will need to be running iOS 12 or later on your iPhone or iPad to use Screen Time to lock your apps. [1] X Research source This method works by only allowing an app to be used for a certain amount of time each day. Once the app is open for the specified amount of time, nobody can open it until the next day. The lowest time you can set is one minute. This means that to truly lock the app, you must keep it open for at least one minute each day. So, after one minute of using the app, it will stay locked until the next day."
