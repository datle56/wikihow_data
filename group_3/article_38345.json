      "content": "Scorpio men play rougher than Cancer women in the bedroom. Scorpio tends to bury their feelings, which can lead to a more aggressive manner in bed; it’s Scorpio’s way of venting their emotions. Cancer has a gentler approach and may not immediately understand Scorpio’s intense desires. As they learn to trust one another, they can get on the same page and enjoy a satisfying sex life. Scorpio men tend to be pretty sexually adventurous, but that doesn’t have to be a problem as long as they honestly discuss their desires with Cancer before jumping into bed. Cancer women may need some time to adjust to Scorpio's energy in bed, but with patience and trust, Cancer may even get Scorpio to relax and unveil their softer side."
