      "content": "X no longer lets most developers access that data. Follower-tracking apps like Unfollower Stats, Unfollowspy, Fllwrs, Who Unfollowed Me, and Zebraboss relied on Xr's free API access to keep track of who unfollowed you. Now that X charges a lot of money for API access, most services that provided free X enhancements can no longer afford to do so. Sometimes, even if a business can afford it, they aren't approved for the level of API access they'd need to track unfollowers."
