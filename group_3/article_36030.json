      "title": "Resist the urge to scratch your skin.",
      "content": "Resist the urge to scratch your skin. Chickenpox can be very itchy and the severity of the rash varies from person to person. [1] X Research source Your scratching starts a scratch-itch cycle that will never end. This constant scratching may result in significant scarring after your blisters have healed. [2] X Research source Scientists have shown that a mild amount of pain is produced when you scratch. This interferes with the itch sensation for just a moment. It only provides temporary relief because the mild pain signal from the scratching causes your brain to release serotonin, a neurotransmitter. Serotonin, which carries signals between nerve cells in your brain and spinal cord, makes you feel the itch sensation more intensely. This is the start of an unending scratch-itch cycle because you start scratching to relieve this itching. If you or your young child cannot stop scratching, trying putting gloves, mittens, or socks on your hands. This can be especially useful during the night when you are sleeping and less able to resist the impulse to scratch."

[3] X Research source Wet a washcloth or small towel with cold water to make the cold compress. You can purchase an ice pack from the store or put ice cubes in a disposable, plastic freezer bag. You want to wrap the ice pack with a towel to prevent your skin from getting too cold which could cause you pain. [4] X Research source The cold compress and ice pack soothe the itching because the nerves that sense you have something cool/cold on your skin send signals that block the itching sensation.

It is not realistic to think that children, especially younger ones, will tolerate having to take such frequent baths. You can try applying frequent cold compresses instead. [8] X Research source Add about four tablespoons of the baking soda, cornstarch, or dry, uncooked oatmeal to your bath water. You can use colloidal oatmeal, which is finely ground and made for the purpose of putting it in bath water. The baking soda, colloidal oatmeal, and cornstarch should dissolve well in the bath water. But, you may want to fill a nylon stocking with the dry oatmeal, tie a knot at the end, and throw it in the tub so that you will not have loose oats floating around the tub or clogging your drain.

It also has anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties which makes it great for treating your itchy skin.

When you dry off after your bath or shower, pat yourself dry and do not rub your itchy skin. [11] X Research source Use a soap and laundry detergent that is dye-free and fragrance-free to prevent further skin irritation. Moisturize your skin with a fragrance-free lotion after taking your bath or shower. A lotion like Aveeno has colloidal oatmeal in it and is a good choice. You should aim to moisturize your skin once or twice every day. Do not apply perfumes, cosmetics, or any other skin products to your skin. If you have blisters around your mouth, it may be painful to eat and drink. Pamper this area by eating foods which are cool, soft, and bland, like Popsicles, lukewarm oatmeal, or lukewarm soup. Definitely avoid food that is spicy, salty, or acidic."
