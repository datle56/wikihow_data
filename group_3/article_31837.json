      "content": "Look at the menu to see if they serve Old Fashioneds. Some bars, especially cocktail bars, will have an Old Fashioned already on their menu. If they do, read up on what they put in their Old Fashioned and see if you want to make any modifications to it before you order. [1] X Research source Some bars will sell their take on an Old Fashioned, or they’ll modernize it and create a “New Fashioned.”"

      "content": "Decide on your order before you go up to the bar. Bartenders move quickly, and they have a ton of people to take orders from. Don’t spend any time hemming or hawing once you get up to the bar. Instead, take a moment before you walk up to decide on the brand of liquor that you want, how bitter or sweet you want your drink, and if you’d like something special to top it.

      "title": "Say your order all at once, starting with what type of whiskey you want.",
      "content": "Say your order all at once, starting with what type of whiskey you want. Order your Old Fashioned in 1 sentence so that you can tell your bartender what you want quickly. Begin by saying what brand and type of whiskey you want, and end with any adjustments you are making to the drink. For example, “I’ll have a Maker’s Mark Old Fashioned, extra bitter.” ”I’ll take a Bullet Bourbon Old Fashioned with a lemon twist.”"

      "title": "Choose between bourbon, rye, or brandy.",
      "content": "Choose between bourbon, rye, or brandy. Most bars keep those 3 classic types of whiskey on hand to make Old Fashioneds with. If you’re not sure what types the bar has, try looking behind the bartender at the shelves where they keep the liquor. Your bar may have more types of whiskey on hand than those 3. Bourbon is slightly sweeter than typical whiskeys, rye whiskey is slightly spicy, and brandy has a slightly floral taste."

    {
      "title": "Specify your brand of liquor.",
      "content": "Specify your brand of liquor. If you have a favorite brand of whiskey, you should choose which one you want in your Old Fashioned. If you don’t specify, you will probably get the cheapest option in your drink. Typical brands include Bulleit Bourbon, Wild Turkey, and Johnnie Walker. For example, “I’ll take a Wild Turkey Old Fashioned.”"

    {
      "title": "Ask for your drink to be more bitter or sweet.",
      "content": "Ask for your drink to be more bitter or sweet. Old Fashioneds are made with bitters, which is liquor that has been flavored with herbs. True to their name, they usually make a drink more bitter or bittersweet tasting. If you want a more sweet Old Fashioned, ask for less bitters in your drink. [3] X Research source Typical Old Fashioneds don’t have much more than a splash of bitters in them. However, every bartender is different, and your bar could use more bitters on average. For example, “I’ll have a Woodford Reserve Old Fashioned, extra sweet.”"

    {
      "title": "Request a lemon twist for a classic Old Fashioned.",
      "content": "Request a lemon twist for a classic Old Fashioned. Some bartenders will top Old Fashioneds with orange wedges or even cherries. A classic Old Fashioned has a simple lemon twist on top to give a citrus scent as you are drinking it. If you want to stick to the classics, request a lemon twist to top your drink. [4] X Research source The bar you go to may not have lemon twists available. For example, “Can I have a Johnnie Walker Old Fashioned with a lemon twist?”"
