      "content": "Pack only the clothes you need. Make a list of the activities you've planned. This will narrow your choices to the necessities. For example, if you're planning on sightseeing one day and a beach party the next, you won't need high heels or a formal dress. Sensible choices include: 2 shirts/blouses 2 trousers/jeans/skirts/shorts 3 pairs of underwear 1 set of pajamas 3 pairs of socks/pantyhose"

      "content": "Limit your shoes. Unless you have multiple events planned during your two days away, you'll probably only need the shoes you're wearing. If you need to pack an extra pair of shoes, wear the heavier shoes en route, and pack the lighter shoes in your luggage. To prevent your clothes from getting dirty, wrap your shoes in a plastic bag.

      "title": "Limit your jewelry.",
      "content": "Limit your jewelry. For a two-day trip, you should only pack (or wear) the jewelry that you absolutely need. You can save space in your luggage by limiting yourself to what you plan to wear en route. If you plan to attend any formal events, choose which of your jewelry is appropriate for multiple occasions. Some examples include: Watch Wedding band/engagement ring Simple gold or silver necklace Stud earrings"

      "title": "Decide what you can leave at home.",
      "content": "Decide what you can leave at home. The more you can leave at home, the lighter your luggage will be. Check with your hotel ahead of time for a list of what will be provided. Most accommodations provide clothes irons, shampoo, conditioner, soap and/or shower gel. Some locations provide hair dryers, sewing kits, cotton balls, cotton swabs, and hand/body lotion. If you’re staying with friends or relatives, ask what they have on hand and if they’re willing to share. As a friendly gesture, offer to repay them with a meal, movie ticket, gift card, etc."

      "title": "Buy travel sizes.",
      "content": "Buy travel sizes. Even if you're not flying, opt for travel-sized containers. Pack them in an easily accessible pocket or compartment in your laptop bag or purse. If you are flying, this will make the security check easier. Toiletries available in sizes of 3.4 fluid ounces (100mL) or less include: Toothpaste Mouthwash Deodorant Sunscreen Hair gel Hairspray"

      "title": "Pack only essential makeup.",
      "content": "Pack only essential makeup. Narrow down which cosmetics to pack by considering which one or two facial features you want to bring out. If you have skin issues that you usually conceal, pack your concealer and facial powder for efficient coverage. You could go the extra step by finding makeup that does double duty. Some examples include: Colored lip gloss Powdered foundation Eyeliner/eyeshadow combo stick"

      "title": "Check the weather at your destination.",
      "content": "Check the weather at your destination. This will narrow your decisions of what to wear and pack. Warmer, tropical climates allow for lighter articles of clothing, such as shorts and tank tops. Colder climates require heavier clothes that would keep you warm, such as jackets, sweaters and coats. Pack a small umbrella if the forecast calls for rain. If an unexpected deluge happens at a time that you absolutely must be outside, ask your host or front desk at the hotel if you can borrow a larger umbrella."

      "title": "Decide on your luggage.",
      "content": "Decide on your luggage. Since you are only going on a two-day trip, smaller luggage is ideal. Some good options are a backpack, duffel bag, or small rolling suitcase. You can maximize limited space with a few packing tips. You could: Roll clothes that won’t wrinkle. These are usually tee-shirts, jeans, and casual clothes made of cotton. Place them in the bottom of your bag. Fold clothes that can wrinkle. This includes cotton dress shirts and anything made of silk or satin. Place them on top of rolled items. Fold longer articles in half. This includes trousers and long skirts. To create even layers, drape the top of the second article on top of the bottom of the first. Make use of spaces that remain. Look for smaller spaces between layers and between articles of clothing. Tuck socks, underwear, and chargers in these spaces."

      "title": "Maximize your laptop bag.",
      "content": "Maximize your laptop bag. Make use of its additional space. In addition to your computer, use pockets for any necessary paper documents. Smaller pockets can fit MP3 players, ear buds, cell phones, flash drives, and business cards. Larger pockets can fit chargers and small adapters."

    {
      "title": "Use your pockets.",
      "content": "Use your pockets. Keys, small cell phones and MP3 players are small enough to fit in your pockets. If you’re flying remember to remove them. Have them x-rayed at the security checkpoint instead. If you’re flying during the winter, put everything in your coat pockets for an easy one-step scan."
