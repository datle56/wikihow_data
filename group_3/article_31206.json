      "content": "“Munchies” also describes feeling hungry after marijuana use. While “munchies” refers to general feelings of hunger, it’s also commonly associated with the tendency to feel hungry after using marijuana (or drinking alcohol). Marijuana can stimulate intense hunger in people who use it, which is why they sometimes say they’ve got the munchies. [2] X Research source “All 4/20 celebrations inevitably end in a case of the munchies.” “I’ve never had the munchies as much as I did that day.”"

However, make sure you’re using this in casual conversations only—and you may want to clarify if you have the munchies for a reason (like drinking or smoking) or if you’re just hungry. “Whoa, I’ve got some serious munchies today. I don’t even know where they came from!” “Let’s get lunch soon! I have the munchies like you wouldn’t believe. 🤤”"

      "content": "Marijuana has a chemical that stimulates the sense of smell and taste. THC is a chemical compound in marijuana that causes the feeling of being high. Research suggests that when it interacts with ghrelin, a hormone secreted by the stomach, it may also enhance a person’s appetite. Thus, using marijuana is said to cause “the munchies”—the hunger pangs people feel as a result of this chemical reaction.

[6] X Research source Because CBD (a cannabinoid) doesn’t have THC in it, it can’t give anyone the munchies."
