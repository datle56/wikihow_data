      "title": "Get enough sleep.",
      "content": "Get enough sleep. Your body requires a period of rest to heal and rejuvenate itself. When we are awake, the body and the mind are active and busy, using our energy to keep us functioning at this level. However, when we sleep, this energy can be used for healing, instead. Make it a habit to get at least 8 hours of good quality sleep every night. Stick to a routine—go to bed at the same time every night. Keep work and stimulating activities out of your bedroom. Relax and unwind before it’s time for bed. Stop worrying about what you haven’t finished or what you have to do the next day. Focus on everything you have accomplished that day."

      "content": "Reduce stress. Stress can impair your immune system and make it more difficult for your body to heal and repair itself. When you are sick, ill, or injured, your body needs to focus on repairing the damage instead of working hard to regulate a stressed system. Avoid stressful activities, places, and people as often as possible. If there is something in your life, such as work or a relationship, that is drawing a lot of your energy and creating a stressful environment, then consider ways of improving or alleviating the source of stress."

      "title": "Get cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT).",
      "content": "Get cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). This effective therapy can help you overcome psychological difficulties or behaviors that are unhealthy by focusing on the thoughts that lead to them. A diary of emotions and thoughts are usually kept and discussed with a therapist who recommends ways to help control negative thoughts that are harming self-esteem or causing stress. Deep breathing and mindfulness can help when negative thoughts creep up to sabotage you. Another way to train your thoughts is to actually experience what you are afraid of, for example, and realize that all the things you feared might happen were mostly made up in your head and not based on real possibilities. Positive repetitive statements can improve mood and help you achieve goals by training your brain to think a certain way. For example, instead of thinking, \"I don't do anything right,\" use this statement to counter it: \"I do a lot of things right, but I also have challenges to overcome. I will keep working on my challenges and learn from my mistakes, and I will come out stronger on the other side.\""

      "title": "Practice self-hypnosis.",
      "content": "Practice self-hypnosis. The mind may sometimes rebel against direct instructions, so using open suggestions can make the unconscious brain more susceptible to believing an idea. You can offer yourself affirmations based on possibilities or make statements based on facts that are happening and follow those statements with suggestions. When the mind acknowledges that the initial statement is true, it tends to believe the statements that follow. For example, you can tell yourself that, “I may start to experience a sense of happiness,” instead of, “I will be happy.” After stating what is obviously happening, such as, “My eyes are closed,” you then bring in a suggestion like, “I am starting to feel calm.”"

Recite a positive phrase like, “I value myself,” or “I am happy.\" You can say it out loud or in your head. [6] X Research source Try to sync your positive phrase with each breath. Ignore distracting thoughts, sounds, emotions and things going on in your environment by bringing your thoughts back to the phrase that you started with. Meditation trains you to be able to put your attention where you want it when you want to. In time, this skill will allow you to move thoughts, emotions, and energy toward your goals, including self-healing."

Our DNA is programmed to know what to do when we get ill or injured—think about how your body knows how to repair a cut without any conscious effort from you. Things can malfunction if your self-repair mechanisms don’t work right. You can help your body heal by keeping your body in a relaxation response as often as possible so it can focus on healing what needs repair and by believing it’s possible. [8] X Research source If you still have trouble believing your mind can heal the body, think about “the placebo effect.” In 18-80% of patients in clinical trials treated with sugar pills, saline injections, or fake surgeries, symptoms somehow resolve—even though there was no “real” treatment.
