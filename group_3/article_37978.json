      "content": "Your dishwasher won't drain if the sink's drain is clogged. You can look in your sink's drain where the washer is connected to see if there is a visible clog. If you have a garbage disposal make sure it's clear of food waste. If you recently installed a garbage disposal or the dishwasher, the disposal cap (if you didn't remove it) may be causing the blockage. Run the sink for about 30 seconds and see if the water drains quickly. If it doesn't drain, you know something is wrong with your sink's drain and not the dishwasher."

      "content": "Food waste and debris can prevent your dishwasher from draining. Many Samsung dishwashers come apart so you can wash the various parts. Routine Clean - Do this type of cleaning regularly to prevent disastrous maintenance bills. Wipe down the outside of the dishwasher and the control panel with a damp microfiber cloth to remove any stains. Place an 8oz cup of distilled white vinegar upright on the lower basket and press the Sanitize button. The dishwasher will reach an internal temp of 163°F to properly sanitize the inside. If the light on your dishwasher keeps blinking at this point, your water isn't getting hot enough. Deep Clean - Do this every few months to keep your dishwasher performing at its best. You should do the Routine Clean first, then follow up with a Deep Clean. Remove nozzles and filters and soak overnight in distilled white vinegar. Cleaning the filter - You should remove and clean filters at least twice a year. Locate the filter inside your dishwasher. Not every Samsung model has removable filters, however. Remove the lower rack to easily access the filter. Rotate the filter handle counterclockwise to unfasten the filter door. Once you remove the filter door, you can take out the filter. Use warm water to clean the filter; allow it to soak in distilled white vinegar overnight to clean thoroughly. Once the filter is clean, replace it and the filter door in your dishwasher. Note that with the filter removed, you can easily get to the drain pump. Cleaning the drain pump - When this is clogged or dirty, your dishwasher can make strange noises or not drain properly. Remove the filter to get to the pump. Not every Samsung dishwasher has a removable filter, so not every Samsung dishwasher lets you access the drain pump easily. Check your user manual if the drain pump isn't located in the center inside your dishwasher. Use a small tool like tweezers or needle-nose pliers to remove anything that's clogging the pump.

      "content": "Pinched hoses, no air gap, and no \"high loop\" prevent dishwashers from draining. A newly installed washer not draining might be because the drain hose is pinched if the hose is caught under the washer. If that's not the case, check the drain hose to make sure it's connected to an air gap or has a \"high loop\" in it – a high loop is when the hose loops higher than the connection with the sink drain and helps prevent overflow and backflow. Also make sure the hose isn't kinked or bent awkwardly in a way that prevents water flow."

If you live in an area that gets below freezing and you have uninsulated pipes, there's a good chance that frozen lines are preventing your dishwasher from draining. Frozen water lines are not covered under the warranty, so you should contact a plumber for more assistance instead."
