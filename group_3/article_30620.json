      "content": "Find the outside diameter if the pipe has male threads or no threads. The outside diameter is from outside edge to outside edge across the pipe. To find it, measure around the circumference of the pipe with flexible measuring tape. Divide the circumference by pi, or about 3.14159. For example, if the circumference is 12.57 inches (319 mm), you would divide by pi, and get an outside diameter of about 4 inches (100 mm). Use string to measure if you don’t have measuring tape. Mark the point on the string where it wraps around the circumference. Then remove the string, measure it against a ruler, and divide that length by pi."

      "title": "Measure the inside diameter if the pipe has female threads.",
      "content": "Measure the inside diameter if the pipe has female threads. That is the distance across the middle of the pipe, not including the thickness of the pipe walls. Use a ruler or a caliper and measure at the end of the pipe, where there is a cross section.

Remember not to measure from the outside edges, but rather from inside edge to inside edge."

If you are unsure, it could help to go to the website of a store in your country that sells pipe. If they mark pipe with inches, then you need the NPS system."

[5] X Research source This table is helpful for NPS measurements: https://blog.enerpac.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/NPS-nominal-pipe-size-chart-inches.pdf This table has both NPS and DN measurements: https://www.massflow-online.com/faqs/where-do-nps-or-dn-stand-for/ For example, if you measured a diameter of 1.05 inches (27 mm), this would translate to a nominal size of ¾ in NPS, or 20 in DN."
