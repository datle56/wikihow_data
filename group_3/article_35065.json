      "content": "“Rawr” is an internet slang way to express affection “in dinosaur.” The word is an imitation of a dinosaur’s roar, used to express how a dinosaur might show affection—and perhaps sexual attraction—to someone. Commonly associated with the emo aesthetic and “LOL so random” humor, the cutesy little growl serves as an interjection in text and online communication. [1] X Research source “Rawr” is a way to show playful or friendly affection without being too vulnerable and open. The word is typically used as an interjection (e.g., “Rawr! I love you!”) but is also sometimes used as a verb (e.g., “I rawr these cookies so much!”). Rawr! You’re my best friend! Rawr! I’m going to eat you up! I miss you! Rawr! 🦕"

      "content": "“Rawr” came about via mid-2000s internet emo culture. “Rawr” (often accompanied by the emoticon XD) became linked to teenagers in the emo and scene subcultures of the internet. Illustrations circulated online (especially on DeviantArt) of dinosaurs with the words “Rawr! It means I love you in dinosaur.” [2] X Research source The term grew in popularity over the decades via viral posts like DeviantArt user SilentReaper’s illustration of a dinosaur entitled “OMG RAWR XD” in 2004, or Facebook user Bardock Obama’s 2015 status that read, “‘Rawr XD’ means ‘Ima eat ya a**’ in dinosaur.” While the word was and is considered by some people to be a “cringe” and infantile way to disguise authentic feelings under playfulness, it’s also, paradoxically, reflective of emo and scene kids’ originality and rejection of social norms."

Tl;dr, have fun with it! [3] X Research source Rawr! I haven’t seen you in ages! Let’s hang out! I rawr you so much! Rawr! You’re my best friend."

      "content": "Use “rawr” to show affection without having to be direct and vulnerable. One of the great things about “rawr” is that it shows you care—but it’s not as overt as saying, “I’m madly in love with you” or “I want your body.” Next time you’re chatting with your crush and you want to tentatively take things up a notch, text them, “Rawr!” and see how they respond. If they “rawr” back? It’s kismet. If they say nothing? Well, maybe they just didn’t get it. Rawr! What are you up to? Rawr XD! I’m so lonely without you! Come over! Rawr!"
