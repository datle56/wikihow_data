Preconditioning not only allows your car to warm up or cool down your battery so you can charge quickly and easily but also allows the battery to optimize so you get the best range possible. If you live in a stable climate that doesn't get too hot or too cold, preconditioning may not be needed. Even if the battery is cold, you can still drive your Tesla. Preconditioning the battery only helps optimize it so your car performs better."

A too-cold or too-hot battery will not charge as quickly or smoothly as a battery at the ideal temperature. In that case, you'd have to wait with the charger plugged into your car as it gets to the ideal temperature before it charges. A preconditioned battery has been prepared for charging and will charge faster. Depending on the temperature outside, the time difference between a non-conditioned battery and a preconditioned one may not be as drastic. However, this is most notable in very hot or cold climates where the difference can be 30 or 45 minutes."
