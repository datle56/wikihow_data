      "content": "Detach the water and gas supply lines. First, turn off the lines by finding the shutoff valves under the sink and range or by turning off the main valve in the basement. Use pliers to twist the ring-shaped nuts to remove the drain pipe and p-trap. Place a bucket under the pipes to catch any water left in them. If you have a garbage disposal unit attached to your sink, don’t forget to unplug the cord from the outlet. Even if the lines are disconnected, use extra caution when you're working around these areas. You don't want to accidentally puncture one of the lines and cause a leak.

      "content": "Loosen the mounting screws and caulk to remove the sink and range. Look underneath the sink or range to find screwed clamps securing these features to the countertops. Use a screwdriver to loosen these, then slice the caulk around the top of the sink or range with a utility knife. [2] X Research source Once finished, push the sink or range from the bottom to lift it off the countertop. Make sure the unit is off to the unit if you’re removing an electric range. Disconnect the power wires in the metal box behind the range to pull the range out."

      "content": "Slice through the caulking on countertops with wall backsplashes. If your countertop has a backsplash secured to the wall, it’ll also have caulking. Hold your utility knife vertically. Run the tip through the caulking all the way to the other end of the backsplash."

      "title": "Detach the fasteners on the old countertops.",
      "content": "Detach the fasteners on the old countertops . Remove the drawers and cabinet doors and look at the underside of your countertop. Locate the screws fastening the wood supports and cabinets. Undo these screws to free the countertop and move it from the wooden supports. Stubborn countertops, particularly older ones installed incorrectly, need to be pried off the countertops with a pry bar. Pry up 1 inch (2.5 cm) and then move 12 inches (30 cm) down the length of your countertop until you reach the end. Then you can use a larger pry bar to lift the entire countertop. You may also slip a reciprocal saw between the countertop and cabinets to cut screws and nails. Work slowly and carefully to avoid damaging your counters, backsplash, or appliances.

      "content": "Measure the space required for the countertops. Run a tape measure along the space where the countertop will rest. If you have your old countertops on hand, they may serve as a useful guide. Note the dimensions the countertops need to be. [4] X Research source When building around a corner in your room, plan on connecting 2 countertops cut diagonally. Adjust your measurements to fit these pieces."

      "title": "Cut the countertops to size.",
      "content": "Cut the countertops to size. Put on safety goggles and a dust mask first to protect yourself from flying shards and material particles. For synthetic countertops like laminate, use a fine-tooth handsaw or jigsaw to fashion the countertops. Placing masking tape over the cutting lines can reduce splintering. [5] X Research source To save time, order the countertops pre-cut. Measure your space before placing the order. You may still need to make some cuts to fit the countertops once you have them."

      "content": "Trace the sink and range space on the countertop. You may want to set the countertop in place first to get a better idea of where these features need to go. Flip the sink or range over, then use a pencil to trace around their perimeter. Trace a second outline 1 ⁄ 2 in (1.3 cm) inside the first one on all sides. [6] X Research source Your sink or range may have come with a template to be used when sketching the outline. If it doesn’t, use posterboard or cardboard to trace your own sink or range template. The trace lines can be hard to see against dark countertops. Place masking tape first and trace over it to make the lines more visible."

      "content": "Check to see that the countertops fit over the cabinets. Place the countertops on the wooden supports or measure their front edges. If they’re not high enough, the front will overhang and block the cabinet doors. You’ll need to add build-up strips."

The build-up strips run from back to front and need to be installed every 2 ft (0.61 m) along the countertop’s length.

Its ends should rest on the front and back edges of the cabinet. Continue laying these strips every 2 ft (0.61 m). [10] X Research source Remember to keep the end strips 2 in (5.1 cm) from the cabinet’s edge."

      "title": "Bolt the countertop pieces together.",
      "content": "Bolt the countertop pieces together. Pre-cut countertops should come with miter bolts to fasten the countertop pieces together. Place the miter bolts in the miter joins on the undersides of the countertops, then twist the end of the bolt to secure everything in place. If you cut the countertops yourself, make miter joints first to fit the countertops together. These can be tricky to make, so consider hiring a professional. Another way to connect countertop pieces is to get an aluminum joining strip from the store. Cut it to size, then screw it to the side of the countertop. Slide the other countertop piece into the joining strip’s groove."

Lay the tool flat against the wall and adjust the pencil end so the tip is on the edge of the tape. Keep the scribing tool at this length and draw the line all the way across the tape. [13] X Research source The countertop should be as level and close to the wall as possible. You may need to add shims under the counter or scribe and sand the cabinet’s sides to do this."

Apply a bead of silicone caulk along the miter joints on the countertop edges. Then push the countertops together and secure the bolt in place one last time. [15] X Research source When using aluminum strips instead of miter joints, you won’t need to do this, so enjoy skipping the extra work."

      "title": "Screw the countertops to the cabinets.",
      "content": "Screw the countertops to the cabinets. The easiest way to do this is to drill up through the build-up strips. Apply the screws so they enter but don't exit the countertop. For extra support, place small angle brackets along the build-up strips. Screw the brackets into the countertop and the cabinets to hold them in place. [16] X Research source 1 1 ⁄ 4 in (32 mm) drywall screws are commonly used for this. Double-check the thickness of your countertop and build-up strips and get longer or shorter screws as needed. To prevent any damage to the countertops, measure the countertop depth first. You can then measure that far down from the tip of your drill bit and place a piece of tape there to show you when to stop."
