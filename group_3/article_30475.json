      "title": "Choose a massage medium.",
      "content": "Choose a massage medium. Massage mediums include mineral oils, moisturizing balms, and hand cream. Mineral oils and massage balms are messy but will provide a long lasting massage lubricant. Alternatively, hand cream is less messy but may need to be reapplied throughout the massage. Look for one or more of these nourishing ingredients in your massage medium: Jojoba oil makes your skin supple. Aloe vera hydrates your skin. Shea butter seals in moisture and prevents cracking. Almond oil deeply moisturizes your skin. However, people with nut allergies should avoid this oil. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Talk about painful spots. If you’re massaging someone else, ask them to identify painful areas in their hands.

Next, spread the warmed medium along the forearm and on both sides of the hand that will be massaged. Use slow, relaxing motions as you work to continue warming the medium. Examine the skin for abrasions and cuts. If you see anything suspicious, don’t do the massage. Otherwise, you’ll risk irritating a wound and causing an infection."
