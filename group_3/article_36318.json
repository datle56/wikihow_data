      "content": "Make toothpaste your first choice. Toothpaste is generally considered the best method for removing Kool Aid. If you have toothpaste on hand, use that before trying other means. Stain removal or whitening toothpastes are probably your best option as they're designed to remove set in stains on teeth and will act similarly on your hands. Look for toothpaste that contains blue covarine, as this has the most immediate effect. You don't need to leave the toothpaste in any longer than it takes to remove the stain."

      "title": "Wash your hands.",
      "content": "Wash your hands. If the Kool Aid stain is on your hands, you should wash your hands. Do so like you would normally wash your hands, but use the stain remover you chose instead of hand soap. Run your hands under clean water. Let your hands get wet before turning off the tap. Be careful, however, as the Kool Aid may drip when wet and you don't want to stain your sink. It might be a good idea to lay a washable cloth towel or paper towel down on the sink while you wash your hands. Lather your hands with the strain remover. Once your hands are wet, apply whatever stain removal method you chose and lather your hands. Make sure you get between your fingers and the back of your hands. Lather your hands for about 20 seconds. It can help to hum the \"Happy Birthday\" song twice to keep track.

If this is the case with you, you can mix in your chosen stain remover with your regular shampoo and take a shower.
