The table's height is usually 30 inches (75 cm) and its width is 20 inches (50 cm). Lines are drawn 6 and 12 inches (15 and 30 cm) from the far end. A foul line is drawn 6 feet (1.8 m) from the far end; disks must cross this line without falling off the table to be eligible to score points. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Start playing.",
      "content": "Start playing. Have players or teams alternate sliding their disks across the table until all disks are cast. The goal of shuffleboard is to get your disk to the furthest point on the board while also trying to knock the other players’ disks off of the board. When playing table shuffleboard in teams, you may also try to knock your partner's disks into a higher scoring area."

      "title": "Score the disks.",
      "content": "Score the disks. If you are playing in teams, then only the player or team whose disks are furthest down the table scores points, and only those disks further down than the opponent's furthest disk score. [2] X Research source If a disk hangs over the far end of the table, it scores 4 points. If a disk crosses the far line without hanging over the far end, it scores 3 points. If a disk crosses the nearer scoring line, it scores 2 points. If a disk crosses the foul line, but no other lines, it scores 1 point. If the disk touches or crosses any of the lines, it scores the value of the lower scoring area. Thus, if a disk has crossed the 3-point line but is still touching it, it scores only 2 points. In some versions of table shuffleboard, a less skilled player scores 1 more point for a hanger or crossing the lines than a more skilled opponent does. You may observe this rule if you choose, just make sure to specify that this rule will be in effect before you start playing."

      "content": "Retrieve the disks and start again. Some table shuffleboard games play from only one end, while others play from either end. Whichever player or team won the last turn starts the next turn. In a 2-player game, the first player to either 11 or 15 points wins the game. In a team game, the first team to 21 points wins the game."

      "title": "Give each player or team 4 wooden disks and a cue.",
      "content": "Give each player or team 4 wooden disks and a cue. You will be using a cue to push the disks down the shuffleboard court. Disks are in 2 colors, usually yellow and black, with a diameter of 6 inches (15 cm) and a thickness from 9/16 to 1 inch (1.4 to 2.5 cm). The cue is a pole no longer than 6 1/2 feet (2 m), with a U-shaped prong on the pushing end."

      "title": "Take turns.",
      "content": "Take turns. Have the players or teams alternate sliding their disks across the court until all of the disks are cast. Starting with the player with the yellow disks, players place their disks in the \"10-off\" section of the scoring area on their end of the court on their turn and shoot toward the opposite scoring triangle. The yellow player's disks are launched on the left side of the court, and the black player's disks are launched from the right side. A player's cue cannot push past the scoring area when shooting a disk. Disks must cross the \"dead line\" 3 feet (0.9 m) in front of the opposite scoring area but must not hang off the edge of the court; disks that fail to cross or that hang are removed from the court. As in table shuffleboard, players try to knock their disks into the higher scoring areas and their opponents into lower scoring areas or out of play entirely."

    {
      "title": "Score the disks.",
      "content": "Score the disks. The triangular scoring area in outdoor shuffleboard is divided into 6 sections; a disk must be entirely inside one of these sections to score points. A disk in the apex of the triangle scores 10 points, a disk in either of the 2 areas behind the apex scores 8 points, and a disk in either of the 2 areas behind the 8-point area's scores 7 points. A disk that lands in the \"10-off\" section deducts 10 points from the score of the player or team who owns the disk. Unlike table shuffleboard, outdoor shuffleboard assesses penalties for rule infractions. A disk that touches the 10-off area line before being played costs a player 5 points; if it touches one of the triangle's sides, the penalty is 10 points. Ten-point penalties are also assessed if a player's body crosses the baseline while playing or shooting an opponent's disk. Remove any illegally played disks from the court. Give any of the opponent's disks that were displaced by an illegally played disks back to the opponent to replay."
