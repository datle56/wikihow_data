      "content": "Identify the country of origin of the goods you're importing. This can end up being a really complex issue if you're importing goods that are made of materials that came from different places. Usually, it's the place where the final product was assembled, but there are some exceptions for materials specifically mentioned in free-trade agreements. [2] X Trustworthy Source U.S. Customs and Border Protection Federal law enforcement agency responsible for monitoring U.S. borders, facilitating international trade, and upholding customs laws Go to source If you're importing clothing, for example, this is usually as simple as listing the country listed on the tag—if it says, \"Made in Sri Lanka,\" then you're importing Sri Lankan goods, even if you're buying them from a seller in Singapore. With some products, such as electronics, you might need to list multiple countries. For example, you might have a computer that was \"assembled in China from components of Cambodia.\" [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Look up your item in the Harmonized Tariff System (HTS). The HTS has duty rates for basically every item that exists—so, as you can imagine, it's massive. Use the HTS website to search for your item by name, then make a note of the HTS number so you can include it on your customs forms. [4] X Trustworthy Source U.S. Customs and Border Protection Federal law enforcement agency responsible for monitoring U.S. borders, facilitating international trade, and upholding customs laws Go to source For example, if you're importing votive candle holders, you'd type \"votive candle holders\" in the HTS search bar and click \"Search.\" Scrolling down the search results, you see \"Votive-candle holders\" listed as 7013.99.3500. Click the item on the search results to see the full information for that item. If you have an ad blocker running on your browser, disable it before using the HTS. The database uses pop-ups to provide explanatory information that you'll likely want to access. If you're unsure about the classification, call the nearest port of entry and ask to speak to a CBP import specialist. They can help you figure out the right classification for the goods you're importing so you don't run into any problems down the line. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Cross-reference the country of origin to find the applicable duty rate. The columns to the right of the name of the item you're importing have duty rates for your item. Column 1 has the rate for countries with which the US has normal trade relations—this is typically the only column you need to worry about. Column 1 is subdivided into \"general\" and \"special.\" If your item's country of origin is listed under the \"special\" heading, no import duties are owed for the item. The duty rates listed in Column 2 only apply to products from countries with which the US does not have normal trade relations—as of 2022, Cuba and North Korea. For example, votive candle holders have a general rate of 6.6%. If you happened to be importing votive candle holders from either Cuba or North Korea, you would pay import duties at a rate of 55%."

      "title": "Total the cost of the goods you want to import.",
      "content": "Total the cost of the goods you want to import. Import duties are a percentage of value, which is most commonly calculated as the price you paid for the goods that you're importing. Since you're importing into the US, that price is computed in US dollars based on the prevailing exchange rate—even if you bought the goods in a foreign currency. [6] X Research source For example, if you purchased 2,000 votive candle holders at $1 a piece, your total cost would be $2,000. In rare instances, you might need to use more complicated methods to find a valuation of your imports, in which case it's a good idea to work with a specialist rather than trying to figure it out on your own."

      "title": "Multiply your total cost by the duty rate to find the duty you owe.",
      "content": "Multiply your total cost by the duty rate to find the duty you owe. Provided you've correctly classified your goods, this equation tells you exactly how much you owe in import duties. Keep in mind, you might still need to pay other federal taxes to import some goods, such as alcoholic beverages or tobacco products. [7] X Research source For example, if you purchased votive candle holders from China, your duty rate would be 5.5%. For a total cost of $2,000, you'd owe $110 in import duties."

      "title": "Add the Merchandise Processing Fee (MPF).",
      "content": "Add the Merchandise Processing Fee (MPF). For goods valued at less than $2,500, the MPF is a set fee of $2.22, $6.66, or $9.99 per shipment, depending on size and weight. For shipments valued at more than $2,500, the MPF is a rate—0.3464% of the value, as of 2022—with a mandatory minimum of $27.75 and a maximum of $538.40. For example, if your goods are valued at $7,500, 0.3464% of that value would be $25.98, so you would pay an MPF of $27.75. Imports from some countries are exempt from the MPF. Look up the country of origin for the goods you're importing on the CBP table of Preferential Trade Programs and Free Trade Agreements to see if your shipment qualifies."

This fee applies to freight shipments that are entering the US through an ocean harbor and amounts to 0.125% of the value of your goods.

These taxes don't apply to imports generally, only to very specific types of products. For example, alcoholic beverages and tobacco products are subject to a federal excise tax. If you're not sure if the goods you're importing are subject to any other taxes, ask a CBP import specialist at your nearest port of entry. They'll be able to tell you. Other taxes, such as state and local sales tax, would come into play if you later sold the goods, but you don't need to worry about those at the import stage. CBP doesn't collect taxes on behalf of individual states."

If the value of your goods is below the postal service limit of $2,000, all you need here is a declaration form that includes a description of the goods shipped and their value (which the seller fills out and attaches to the outside of the package). Just pay your duties and fees, if any, when the package is delivered to your local post office. [8] X Research source Pros : cheapest delivery, can be handled in a single trip to the local post office Cons : no tracking numbers, can be slow There are exceptions to the $2,000 limit for postal service delivery. If you're importing footwear, handbags, leather, plastics, rubber, and some toys or sporting equipment, the maximum total value is $250. Check the full list to make sure your goods don't fall under any of these exceptions.

This is more common if you're buying something for personal use, or a small quantity of something that wouldn't be subject to duties anyway. [11] X Trustworthy Source U.S. Customs and Border Protection Federal law enforcement agency responsible for monitoring U.S. borders, facilitating international trade, and upholding customs laws Go to source Keep in mind that it's ultimately CBP that decides how much you owe in duties—not you, the seller, or the shipper of your goods.

Decide how you're getting the goods to the country, then find the nearest port of entry to you. If you've arranged for door-to-door delivery of your goods, the port of entry might not matter as much. But it's still a good idea to choose one as close to you as possible—you might have to make a trip to the port of entry if a problem comes up with your goods. If you're importing goods valued at more than $2,500, the CBP requires you to use formal entry, which means filing documentation of your shipment, paying a deposit, and getting a customs bond. You might also have to travel to the port of entry to enter the goods yourself."

When you contact them, they'll get information about your shipment from you, then complete and file the paperwork on your behalf and clear your goods through customs so you don't have to worry about it. International courier services, such as Fed-Ex or DHL, automatically use a customs broker to clear your goods on your behalf (and include it in your total shipping cost)—just another benefit of using one of these services rather than trying to deal with everything yourself. Customs broker fees vary depending on the size and complexity of your shipment. For a simple shipment that only involves 1 or 2 types of goods, you'll likely pay a couple of hundred dollars.

Then, the goods themselves have to be transported for release. CBP will release your goods provided everything is in order. If CBP confiscates your goods for some reason, you can file a protest through your ACE account. CBP can require examination of your goods before releasing them. In that case, your goods would be transported to another site for examination before release. This takes at least another day. Remember, even though your goods have been released, that doesn't mean the import process is over. You'll get a statement when CBP has liquidated the entry, which could be up to a year from the date the goods were released. If CBP determines that you overpaid your duties, you'll get a refund plus interest. For example, if you paid a deposit of $2,000 and CBP determined you only owed $1,500, you'll receive a refund for $500 plus interest that has accrued from the date of release. On the other hand, if you underpaid your duties, you'll get a bill for the difference plus interest. For example, if you paid a deposit of $1,000 and your entry liquidated at $1,200, CBP will send you a bill for $200 plus interest."
