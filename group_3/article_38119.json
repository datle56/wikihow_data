      "title": "Say \"¡Cállate!\" to quiet someone in most casual settings.",
      "content": "Say \"¡Cállate!\" to quiet someone in most casual settings. This is perhaps the most common way to say \"be quiet\" in Spanish, although it's better translated as meaning \"shut up\" or \"shut it.\" Although it's pretty common to hear, it's still a pretty informal phrase that you wouldn't want to say in an official or formal setting. It's usually used when there's some emotional reason that you want someone to stop talking. [5] X Research source \"No. Sólo siéntate y cállate.\" (No. Just sit down and be quiet.) \"Ahora, cállate y presta atención.\" (Now, shut up and pay attention.) Adding \"por favor\" makes this a little more polite, although it's still a casual phrase that shouldn't be used in formal settings. For example, you might say, \"Te quiero, cariño, pero cállate, por favor.\" (I love you, dear, but be quiet, please.)"

      "content": "Use \"cierra la boca\" to tell someone to shut up. In English, you might use phrases like \"shut your mouth\" or \"shut it\" to tell someone to stop talking. Depending on your tone and the person you're talking to, this phrase can be quite rude. But if you're just saying it to your friends in a joking way it's not a big deal. [6] X Research source \"Si no tienes nada interesante que decir, cierra la boca.\" (If you have nothing interesting to say, keep your mouth shut.) \"Abre los oídos y cierra la boca.\" (Open your ears and shut your mouth.) \"Cierra la boca por una vez.\" (Shut your mouth for once.)"

      "content": "Shush your friends with \"chitón.\" This is considered similar to saying \"shh\" or \"shush\" in English, although it's not as widely used. It's only appropriate in the most casual settings when you're with friends your age or people you know really well—otherwise, it could be considered rude. \"Chitón. Quiero oír esto.\" (Shhh. I want to hear this.) \"Chitón, es un secreto.\" (Shhh, it's a secret.) \"¡Chitón! El bebé está dormido.\" (Shhh! The baby is sleeping.)"
