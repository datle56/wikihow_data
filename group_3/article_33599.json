      "content": "The correct phrase is “play it by ear,” not “play it by year.” The two phrases sound very similar when spoken aloud, which is probably the reason for the confusion. “Play it by year” likely developed out of people mishearing the correct phrase, and it doesn’t actually have a meaning of its own."

      "content": "“Play it by ear” means doing something without planning or preparation. When someone “ plays it by ear ,” they take a situation as it comes, rather than planning in advance. [1] X Research source For example, if your friend asks what you’re doing over the weekend, but you don’t want to commit to a specific schedule, you could say, “I’m not sure yet. I think I’m just going to play it by ear.” Here are a few more examples: “My mom asked what I want to do for my birthday, but I don’t have a plan in mind. I just want to see how I feel on that day and play it by ear.” “I want our date night to be more spontaneous, so I didn’t make any reservations. Let's go wherever the night takes us and play it by ear!” “My boyfriend likes to have things super planned out when we go on vacation, but I’d rather just explore and play things by ear, without a strict schedule.”"

      "content": "The phrase “Playing it by ear” was originally used by musicians. Musicians use the phrase to describe the act of playing a piece from memory. It can also refer to the ability to learn a piece simply by listening to it, rather than looking at the sheet music. When someone can do this, they’re said to have “a good ear.” [2] X Research source Over time, the phrase has grown to mean doing something without a specific plan, just as the original version meant playing music without a written score."

I just go with the flow and go wherever they tell me to!”"

[6] X Research source For example, if someone asks you what you want to do with your life, you could reply, “I’m not sure—I’m just making it up as I go along!” Here are a few more examples: “My parents were asking me what I’m planning to do with my degree. I told them I’m not sure—I’m just making it up as I go along!” “When I first started that job, I didn’t know what I was doing at all. I was just making it up as I went along.”"
