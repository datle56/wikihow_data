Always test the polish in an inconspicuous area before applying it to the rest of your furniture."

DE works to prevent and kill termites because, on the microscopic level, it’s made up of sharp shards that can slice through termites’ exoskeletons. [6] X Research source Also apply the diatomaceous earth around the foundation of your house to kill more termites and create a barrier. Wear a dust mask and goggles when you sprinkle the DE if you have sensitive lungs and eyes."
