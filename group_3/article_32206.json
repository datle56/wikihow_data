You may do this either of 2 ways: [3] X Research source Take an orbital sander to cabinet surfaces you plan on painting, and sand them down until they are no longer shiny. Wipe the dust off with tack cloth. Clean the cabinet surfaces with TSP (or a TSP substitute) a heavy-duty cleaner that can be found in any home improvement store, which removes thick layers of grease, dirt and grime. Repeat the TSP cleaning process until the cabinet finish is dull, then wipe the surfaces down with water to remove any remaining traces of TSP. [4] X Research source"

Paint a second coat before painting cabinets if the first primer coat didn't fully cover the cabinet surfaces."
