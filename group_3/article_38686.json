      "content": "Determine your domain's value. Before you start taking offers or listing your domain, take stock of its value so that you can come up with a good price. There are a lot of factors to take into consideration when determining the value of a domain, so if you are unsure it may be wise to contact a company that performs these assessments. Some of the major factors include: Traffic - This is one of the primary influences on the domain's value. The number of visitors the domain gets from users typing the URL, searching, or coming from links will have a big impact on the value, especially if these visitors are monetized. Top Level Domains - The most valuable websites are \".com\" websites. These are far more valuable than any other top-level domain (.info, .biz, .net, etc.). Length and Readability - One- and two-word names in English are the most valuable commodities. They are especially valuable if they are directly related to the industry (hotels.com, biking.com, etc.), read well, and are easy to memorize."

      "content": "Be realistic about the price. Domains that sell for thousands of dollars are rare. Unless you have a highly sought-after domain, you may not receive a large amount for it. It will help to be realistic in your pricing if you are intent on selling them."

      "title": "Hang up a \"For Sale\" sign.",
      "content": "Hang up a \"For Sale\" sign. One of the best ways to get offers on your domain is to put up a simple \"For Sale\" message on your site. This will let any visitor know immediately that the domain is available for purchase and how to get in contact. There are several ways you can do this: Many domain registrars provide simple free websites. Use the tools provided to create basic page that indicates the domain is for sale. You could include a link to the domain listing or include your contact information (beware of spam). You can add a page to one of your existing websites and redirect all of your for-sale domains to that sales page. Adjust your WHOIS information to show that your domain is for sale. You can change your registration information to reflect the fact that the domain is for sale. For example, you can add \"Domain For Sale\" to the end of the owner's name."

      "title": "Use escrow services for direct sales.",
      "content": "Use escrow services for direct sales. When you are dealing directly with the buyer, make sure that any money that is transferred goes through an escrow service. This will ensure that all checks are clear and that you aren't left with a bounced check and no domain. Escrow services may add a few days to a sale and cost you a percentage, but they can save you a lot of heartaches. If your domains are selling for smaller amounts, escrow services may not be cost-effective. [1] X Research source"
