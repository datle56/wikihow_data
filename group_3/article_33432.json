      "title": "Follow and memorize Ernie's instructions.",
      "content": "Follow and memorize Ernie's instructions. When you first load Township, he will give you a short guide on how to use the game. This includes helping friends, naming your town and feeding your animals. As you level up, he will tell you about each building (airport, zoo, mine, etc.). When Ernie tells you to name your town, refrain from choosing the name \"Township\". Many people do this; it causes confusion as to which player is which. Instead, try choosing something that describes your town like \"Factory World\" or \"Lakeside.\""

      "title": "Invite some friends from the 'Find Friends' tab.",
      "content": "Invite some friends from the 'Find Friends' tab. They will stay in your 'Pending' section until they accept the request. Try to choose some that are around your level. Make sure you're interested in watching their town grow as you maintain your own. You can send five gifts a day to any five friends on your friends list. You can also invite them to your co-op if you are an elder, co-leader or leader. That can be done via the button on the left-hand side. Small note: you can only have a co-op from level 19 upward. You won't find the button talked about above until you're level 19 or higher."

      "content": "Produce items using the factories that you have. They can be useful in helping friends fill their orders, filling train cars, filling airplane crates, and filling orders at the helipad. The shelves can temporarily store items (shelves are above the producing area when you click on the factory). You can also collect items straight away. Do not collect the items right away; leave them waiting in the factories. This way, you can collect them when needed rather than cluttering up your barn's limited storage. The helipad is easy to use. You click on the building, look at a few orders, and decide if you want to fill them or not. You can either fill or delete them, depending on what you feel like doing."

Decorations cost coins and T-cash, but it is worthwhile to get a few. In the hardhat section, you'll find all the buildings you have in Township too. If you do not have enough decorations, the townspeople will start to complain in the form of little speech bubbles coming from the buildings. More options are unlocked as you level up, but they will usually cost a bit more."

You have somebody else's town, send them the same details as if you were banned unfairly. You have lost your town - send them all the town details, and if you were connected to Facebook via Township, they can try to restore it."
