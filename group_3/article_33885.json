      "title": "Chill the bowl and whisk for 20 minutes in your refrigerator.",
      "content": "Chill the bowl and whisk for 20 minutes in your refrigerator. Heavy cream whips best when it’s cold, and putting the bowl and whisk in the refrigerator will help keep the cream cool throughout the whipping process. Letting the bowl and whisk chill in the refrigerator for just 20 minutes should do the trick. [1] X Research source Alternatively, you could chill the bowl and whisk in your freezer for at least 5 minutes."

      "title": "Whisk heavy cream on medium-high speed until it begins to thicken.",
      "content": "Whisk heavy cream on medium-high speed until it begins to thicken. Begin by pouring 3 cups (710 mL) of heavy or whipping cream into a mixing bowl. Then, use a stand mixer or hand mixer to whisk. When the cream begins to thicken, slow the whisking speed to medium. [2] X Research source Using a stand mixer is usually faster than a hand mixer."

      "title": "Pour in 5 tablespoons (62.5 g) of sugar gradually.",
      "content": "Pour in 5 tablespoons (62.5 g) of sugar gradually. Add the sugar as you’re whisking the cream at medium speed. Try to distribute the sugar as evenly in the cream as possible. [3] X Research source Add a little bit of sugar at a time to ensure you end up with a smooth consistency. To stabilize whipped cream you can add more sugar."

      "title": "Whisk the cream at medium speed until you see soft peaks begin to form.",
      "content": "Whisk the cream at medium speed until you see soft peaks begin to form. When you raise the whisk, the cream should rise like a mountain peak before immediately flopping over and losing its shape. Once soft peaks begin to form, you can turn off your electric mixer.

      "title": "Add 1 1⁄2 teaspoons (7.4 mL) of vanilla extract.",
      "content": "Add 1 1 ⁄ 2 teaspoons (7.4 mL) of vanilla extract. Measure out the vanilla extract and pour it into the bowl with the cream mixture. You can add less extract or more depending on your preference. The more you add, the richer the vanilla flavor. [5] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Whisk the cream by hand until stiff peaks begin to form in the cream.",
      "content": "Whisk the cream by hand until stiff peaks begin to form in the cream. When you raise your whisk, the cream should be stiff enough to stand up straight without losing its shape. The tip of the cream peak should also stand straight. [6] X Research source If your cream isn’t stiffening up, don’t give up. Be patient and keep whipping until you get a firm consistency."

      "title": "Put the cream frosting in the refrigerator to keep it cool.",
      "content": "Put the cream frosting in the refrigerator to keep it cool. Once the cream frosting is the right consistency, put the cream in your refrigerator to chill. Keeping the cream frosting cold will help it keep its consistency. If you’ll be using the frosting immediately, you do not need to refrigerate it. [7] X Research source When you're ready to use or work with the frosting, take it out of the fridge and let it warm up a bit. Then whisk it again."

      "content": "Chill the mixing bowl, whisk attachment, and sugar in your refrigerator. If they’re not cool enough, the bowl, whisk attachment, and sugar will add heat to the heavy cream. This added heat may prevent full aeration of the cream. For best results, cool the sugar and mixing equipment to around 70 °F (21 °C)."

      "title": "Mix sugar, heavy or whipping cream, vanilla, and salt in a bowl.",

Use 3 1 ⁄ 2 ounces (99 g) of chilled sugar, 5 ounces (140 g) of heavy cream, 1 teaspoon (5 g) of vanilla extract, and 1/8 teaspoon (0.75 g) of kosher salt. Set the speed of your hand mixer or stand mixer to medium-low and mix the ingredients until the sugar dissolves into the cream. [8] X Research source At medium-low speed, it should take about 2 minutes for the sugar to fully dissolve into the cream. Don’t use light cream, table cream, or half and half as a substitute for heavy or whipping cream. If you do, your mixture will end up being too runny and won’t be the consistency you need for frosting. [9] X Research source"

      "title": "Beat the cream at high speed to thicken the mixture.",
      "content": "Beat the cream at high speed to thicken the mixture. After the sugar has dissolved, increase your mixer’s speed to high. Beat the cream for about 2 minutes, or until the cream thickens. [10] X Research source You’ll want the cream to be about the consistency of Greek yogurt."

      "title": "Add 8 ounces (230 g) of cream cheese.",
      "content": "Add 8 ounces (230 g) of cream cheese. Once the cream has thickened, begin adding in the cream cheese gradually, in small lumps of 2 tablespoons (30 grams) at a time. It should take you about 30 seconds to add in the entire 8 ounces (230 g) of cream cheese you need for the recipe. [11] X Research source Use full-fat cream cheese that comes in a brick. Cream cheese that comes in a tub is not meant for baking. Mascarpone can be a good substitute for cream cheese. [12] X Research source"

      "content": "Turn off the mixer and scrape the cream off the bowl and whisk. Clumps of sugar and cream cheese will stick to the whisk and bowl during the initial mixing, and you want to be sure to mix these bits into the cream, so that you get the right flavor and consistency. A spoon or flexible spatula will work well as a scraping tool. [13] X Research source"

      "content": "Whip the cream on high to make a light and fluffy frosting. Now that all your ingredients are blended together, continue to whip the cream to get the light and airy consistency you want for your frosting. The time you will need to spend to get the right consistency will vary depending on the type of mixer you are using and the temperature of your kitchen. If you’re using a stand mixer, whip for around 2 to 3 minutes, or until the frosting is smooth. If you’re whipping with a hand mixer, it may take a little longer."
