      "title": "Explain the procedure.",
      "content": "Explain the procedure. Greet the patient and explain that you are going to help them use the bedpan. Show patience and compassion, as this can be an uncomfortable and embarrassing situation for the patient. Assure the patient that you know what to do and will make the experience as pleasant as possible. Explaining everything to the patient beforehand can help calm your patient and reduce their fear and uncertainty."

      "content": "Warm the bedpan. Fill the bedpan with very warm water. Let the water sit for several minutes; then, dump it out and dry off the bedpan. [4] X Research source The heat from the water should transfer to the bedpan itself, warming it up. A warm bedpan will be more comfortable for the patient to use than a cold one. If it is a metal bedpan, ensure that itâ€™s not too hot."
