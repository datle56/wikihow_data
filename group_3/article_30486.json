      "content": "Stretch out your shoulder blade muscles, while standing up or laying down. Stretching your shoulder muscles provides a therapeutic type of massage and stretch. This is a worthwhile technique because you don’t need any equipment and can stretch your shoulder blades wherever you are. Roll your shoulders and shoulder blades a few times, then swing your arms around in a circular motion to loosen them up a little. Try reaching your arms behind your back and clasping your hands. Or instead, put them on the small of your back and stretch by leaning backwards. Finally, get down on the floor and do a couple of yoga poses. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Use foam rollers and tennis balls. A foam roller is a cylinder that looks kind of like a pool noodle, but it's much firmer. Foam rollers and tennis balls are great tools for massaging your shoulder blades. This is because they allow you to reach parts of your shoulders and back that you wouldn't be able to reach all by yourself. Place it on the floor and lay with your shoulders on top of it. The roller should be at a 90 degree angle to your spine. Then move back and forth to use the foam roller to work out some of the tension in your shoulders and shoulder blades. You can use a tennis ball in a similar manner, by lying flat with a tennis ball under your shoulders and moving around to massage your muscles. [2] X Research source"
