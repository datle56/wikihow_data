You might need specialized treatment for a phobia rather than just being treated for another type of anxiety disorder, since you may have feelings of extreme stress from just thinking about being at a certain height. You may also experience physiological changes, such as heightened heart rate and blood pressure and increased sweating. [2] X Research source If so, you may need specialized treatment for a phobia rather than just being treated for another type of anxiety disorder. [3] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source If your fear of heights isn’t quite as severe as this, you may be able to work towards easing any discomfort you feel at certain heights with a little practice. On the other hand, if your discomfort is so severe that you can't face it yourself, you may need to move on to trying therapy or treating it with medication. For example, have you ever not taken a job because it was located above a certain floor, or passed up the opportunity to meet with important people because they asked you to meet at a location too high off the ground? If so, it could indicate something more serious than a mere “fear of heights,” like a phobia/anxiety disorder. If you aren’t sure how many times your fear of heights has kept you from doing what you want, sit down and make a list. Think back to all the times you didn’t do what you wanted or needed to do because of your fear. Putting them down on paper could give you a better sense of how seriously your fear has impacted your life."

By definition, a phobia is an “irrational” fear of experiences that most people would not find threatening. [4] X Research source But, if your fear of heights is relatively minor, an appeal to statistics could put things in perspective. For the most part, the sorts of things that trigger a fear of heights (skyscrapers, airplanes, and roller coasters, for instance) are incredibly safe. [5] X Research source [6] X Research source These things are specifically engineered to be as sturdy and secure as possible. It's easy to forget just how unlikely it is for you to suffer any harm at all from normal, everyday activities like flying or working in a tall building. For instance, depending on the airline, the odds of being involved in a fatal plane crash can be as low as about 1 in 20 million. [7] X Research source . Compare that to the odds of any given US citizen being struck by lightning, which are estimated to be about 1 in 1 million. [8] X Research source ."

      "content": "Gradually expose yourself to your fear. Try to slowly and progressively expose yourself to greater heights. For instance, you might want to start by simply studying on a 2nd-story balcony. Next, you could try to hike a large hill and look down over the distance you covered. When you're comfortable, continue exposing yourself to greater heights. If you can, always try to feel as supported as possible during these activities, by inviting a friend along, for example. Take pride in each accomplishment and don't lose momentum. With patience, you might eventually find yourself bungee jumping to celebrate your new strength. It can be very difficult to force yourself to do something you know will make you nervous. To give yourself a little extra \"push\", create situations where you'll have to confront your fear. For instance, if you're at a carnival and a friend wants you to go on a certain scary ride, tell him you'll do it and buy yourself a ticket. You're more likely to do it if you're already invested in the experience. Don't forget that you can use relaxation techniques to calm your jitters."

Try to find a therapist who has been in practice long enough to generate a number of happy, healthy former patients. If you can, talk to some. Ask them how effective and comfortable their experience was and whether they would recommend their therapist. Think twice about therapists who seem inexperienced or are unable to back up claims of success. Method of treatment. Most reputable therapists use modern, scientific techniques that have been subjected to peer review in legitimate medical publications.

Though the cause of acrophobia isn't entirely understood, research has suggested it may be related to the way the body interprets visual and spatial stimuli from the vestibular system and eyes.

This may lead sufferers to feel disoriented or dizzy and incorrectly judge the positions of their own appendages.

For someone suffering from a fear of heights, this could mean something like riding a roller coaster, going skydiving, or looking over the edge of a cliff. Recent research has shown that acrophobia is an innate, rather than a learned condition, which means that pushing acrophobics \"in to the deep end\" may have no effect at all. It may even aggravate the fear. Further research is needed to find a definitive cause for acrophobia. Until the fear is fully understood, it is not a good idea to expose acrophobics to extreme heights without first treating the fear with therapy, medication, etc."
