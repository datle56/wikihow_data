Once you have your measurements, double the length to find out how long your piece of fabric needs to be.

      "title": "Cut foam",
      "content": "Cut foam the size of your bench. Trace the size of your bench seat onto the foam with a marker or pen using a ruler. Next, cut the foam to size using an electric knife. [3] X Research source You want to use a blade with a serrated edge when cutting foam as it makes it easier to smoothly cut the foam particles. If you don’t have an electric knife, a serrated steak knife or turkey carver can also do the trick. There are many types of foams out there, ranging in density and thickness. We suggest using a 2 or 4 in (5.1 or 10.2 cm) thick foam for maximum comfort."

      "title": "Trace a pattern",
      "content": "Trace a pattern on the back of your fabric. Lay your fabric out flat on a hard surface, making sure the back of the fabric is facing up. Set your piece of foam or cushion on top of the fabric. With a marker or pen, trace around the cushion. Next, gently lift the foam onto its side, keeping the edge on the line you just made. Trace around this side the same way. Repeat this process until all sides of the cushion (except for the bottom) have been traced. [4] X Research source In the end, your pattern should look like an unfolded box. This step will help you get an exact pattern or guide. If patterns aren’t your thing, no worries! You can also cut out individual pieces of fabric for each side of the cushion. This works best if you’re making a cushion cover with a zipper or non-removable cover."

[5] X Research source This will be the area between the edge of your fabric and the stitching that holds everything together. If you’re a sewing beginner, try outlining the seam allowance in a different color than the pattern. This will help you differentiate everything while sewing."

Because of this, the fabric has to be a bit bigger than the actual size of the foam. Use a ruler to extended the border of your outline, dragging down the lines you’ve already made by 3 inches (7.6 cm). [7] X Research source For example, if your foam is 11 by 7 inches (28 cm × 18 cm), the bottom piece of fabric should be 14 by 10 inches (36 cm × 25 cm)."
