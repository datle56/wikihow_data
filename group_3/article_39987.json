      "content": "Place small snacks into a bag. Use a bag, such as a backpack, messenger bag, or purse to hide outside food and beverages. For example, you could hide small snacks such as candy, chocolate bars, chips, fruits and veggies, popcorn, or bottled beverages inside your bag. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Put snacks into a sealed container.",
      "content": "Put snacks into a sealed container. This way your snacks won’t spill inside of your bag while you are transporting them into the theatre. A sealed container will also mask the smell of popcorn or other snacks in your bag, making them less noticeable."

    {
      "title": "Cover the food with other items.",
      "content": "Cover the food with other items. Place a wallet, day planner, or any other item overtop of the food you are sneaking into the theatre. That way, if someone looks inside your purse, they'll just see your personal belongings, not the food. If your theatre is located in a shopping mall, place your snacks in a bag with branding of a store in said mall."

    {
      "title": "Don’t overstuff the bag.",
      "content": "Don’t overstuff the bag. Make sure to choose a bag that is large enough to fit all the snacks you want to sneak into the theatre. You should not stuff your bag so full that some of the snacks are sticking out of the top. This is a sure way to get caught. Make sure that the snacks fit into your bag and are not visible.

      "title": "Hide a small snack or two in your pockets.",
      "content": "Hide a small snack or two in your pockets. Wear large and baggy clothing and then hide small snacks in your pockets. For example, you could wear a pair of cargo pants, preferably a pair with plenty of pockets, and hide candy or chocolate in the pockets; or you could hide a snack in your coat pocket. Take a look in the mirror before leaving your house to make sure that none of the food is visible. [3] X Research source Try putting a few coins in each pocket, so if they hear the crinkling of a bag, they instead hear coins. This will make them think you have money to buy snacks from the theatre."

      "title": "Conceal food you're carrying with a sweater or jacket.",
      "content": "Conceal food you're carrying with a sweater or jacket. In some instances, the food you want to sneak in may be too large to fit into your sweater or pant pockets. If this is the case, you can roll up your coat or jacket and hold it over your arm. Wrap any food items inside your jacket. It will just look like you are carrying your jacket and no one will suspect that food is hidden inside! Alternatively, you can hide food up the front of your jacket. You may look larger than normal, but chances are an employee will not ask you to lift your shirt unless it looks very suspicious."

      "title": "Hide your food in your shirt to make you look pregnant.",
      "content": "Hide your food in your shirt to make you look pregnant. If you are a woman and at a reasonable age for this (roughly 20-40), this is a good option. People tend to be more considerate around pregnant woman, and the movie theatre employees would never ask you to lift up your shirt to see if there's something under. To do this with popcorn, put it in a plastic bag and put it under your shirt by your stomach. If you have other food, put it in a plastic bowl and put the bowl on your stomach, then tie a sweater around your waist to keep the bowl from slipping. You can also secure the bowl with thin rope or elastic. Walk around for a bit and look in front of a mirror to make sure it looks realistic and isn't slipping. Preferably wear layers, as this will hide any bumps in your fake pregnant belly and keep it from slipping. People also sell fake pregnant bellies that you can use for the same purpose. Also, make sure you have an answer if someone asks when you're due. The bigger your snacks, the sooner it should be. However, don't push your luck. You shouldn't look more than six months pregnant or people might suspect something or worry about you."

      "title": "Hide food in your sleeves.",
      "content": "Hide food in your sleeves. This works best with long skinny items, such as chocolate bars. Hold your arms casually at your sides and no one will look twice. You can tie the food to your arm using an elastic band or string. This way the food will not fall out while you are walking and swinging your arms."

    {
      "title": "Act natural.",
      "content": "Act natural. No one will look twice if you don't give them a reason to be suspicious. Act normal and do not keep checking your bag or pockets. If you do get caught, apologize and admit that you were bringing in food. Chances are they will just confiscate the food and allow you to stay and watch the movie."

    {
      "title": "Pick items that are sold at the concession stand.",
      "content": "Pick items that are sold at the concession stand. Most theatres sell candy and other snacks that can be purchased at any convenience or grocery store. You can easily smuggle these items into the theatre, because no one will suspect that they were not purchased from the concession stand. It is highly unlikely that you would ever be asked to provide a receipt. [4] X Research source Some large movie theatre chains also sell food such as hot dogs, pizza, and burgers. If this is the case, you could try sneaking in larger items."

    {
      "title": "Select items that are not loud.",
      "content": "Select items that are not loud. Some foods can be loud to open and eat. For instance, most movie theatres do not sell soda in a can. The sound of a can of cola being opened will surely draw attention. [5] X Research source But, some theatres sell canned drinks like energy drinks, so it may be mistaken for something already sold. If you want to bring your own soda, pour it into a water bottle so you won't disturb others watching the movie by opening the can. Similarly, you can leave loud wrappers at home by opening up your candy in advance and transferring it to a resealable baggie. This will be much quieter and you can eat the food without drawing attention. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Choose food that doesn’t smell.",
      "content": "Choose food that doesn’t smell. When sneaking food into a theatre, avoid foods that have a strong scent. This may cause you to stand out and could increase your chances of getting caught by the theatre staff. Stick to scentless foods, such as trail mix, candy, or bottled water. [7] X Research source Don't try to sneak in a burger or onion rings. Not only will the person next to you be extremely jealous, but the scent may draw the attention of the staff."

      "title": "Select snacks not meals.",
      "content": "Select snacks not meals. As a general rule, you should never eat anything in a dark movie theatre that requires cutlery. Aside from the fact that you will likely make a huge mess, it is also inconsiderate to the other people trying to watch the film. Cutlery is loud and can distract from the movie. Leave your leftovers at home and stick with small snacks and finger foods. [8] X Research source"

      "title": "Don’t eat smuggled food in front of the staff.",
      "content": "Don’t eat smuggled food in front of the staff. Once you are inside the theatre, be discreet. Keep your smuggled food hidden and avoid eating these items in front of the theatre employees. This way you are less likely to get caught."
