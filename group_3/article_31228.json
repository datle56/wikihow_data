      "content": "You've started to grow apart. People grow and change through the years—that's inevitable. But if you and your spouse start growing apart rather than growing together, it signals that your marriage could be over. This is especially true if you have different interests than you used to and just don't enjoy doing the same things anymore. [1] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source For example, if both of you used to play on a community softball team, but now your spouse has taken up tennis and you're swimming, you no longer have that common interest. Having separate interests can be a good thing, but if you're not taking an interest in what your spouse is doing and supporting their endeavors , your relationship could be headed downhill."

      "content": "There's little to no physical or emotional intimacy. A lack of physical intimacy in particular is seen by many as the \"canary in a coal mine.\" When you and your spouse are no longer physically intimate, it's often only a matter of time before your marriage hits the skids. [2] X Research source Physical intimacy is more than just sex—it's also holding hands, cuddling up on the couch together while you're watching TV, or rubbing each other's arms or back as you pass by one another. Emotional intimacy includes simply being vulnerable with each other and talking about your feelings."

    {
      "title": "You don't have conversations anymore.",
      "content": "You don't have conversations anymore. One of the biggest things that signals the downfall of a relationship is when you and your spouse stop making a little bit of time for each other each day. You don't ask how their day was or share your thoughts or frustrations or what's going on with you. Sharing experiences is a big part of a relationship and when that falls away, the relationship starts to fall away as well. Simply sharing things throughout the day is a way to rebuild this connection. For example, you might share an article you read that you thought was really interesting. Playful, fun communication is part of this as well. Sharing memes you found funny or a joke you heard can help bring the conversations and friendliness back."

      "content": "You rarely spend any time together and feel awkward when you do. If you're happier and more comfortable when you're alone than when you're with your spouse, there are definitely problems in your relationship. When you make plans, you tend to make plans with other friends or go out by yourself rather than going out with your spouse. When you are together, you might feel as though there's a tension—you don't know what to say or do and it feels a bit off. [3] X Research source Think about how you feel when your spouse is on their way home. If you start feeling down when you know they're going to be home soon, you know you've got problems."

As much as you want to be forgiving and understanding, if your spouse has problems in these areas, it might be time to call it quits. [5] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source A marriage can recover after infidelity, but only if the affairs stop and both of you are committed to each other and willing to work to heal your partnership. Addiction is tricky if the person with the problem isn't willing to get help. Codependency and enabling can become real issues if you continue to stay with someone who's battling an addiction."

      "content": "You feel a lot of contempt and resentment towards your spouse. Research shows that contempt is the number one predictor of divorce. The moment you start viewing your spouse with contempt (or vice versa), you know your marriage is headed downhill fast. Contempt typically looks like eye-rolling, sarcasm, or hostile humor. If this is your default reaction when you're talking to your spouse (or theirs when talking to you), it's a bad sign for your marriage."

      "content": "You've stopped talking about the future. When you got married, you both vowed to be together for the rest of your lives. It's natural for you to talk about what you'll be doing years into the future. When you stop doing that, you're signaling that you don't see them in your future. For example, you might stop saying things like \"we should do that for Christmas next year\" or \"let's come back to this beach to celebrate our anniversary in 5 years.\""

      "content": "Criticism The first stage might be something that you only recognize in retrospect. You start to see your spouse negatively and frequently criticize them (or they criticize you). You look for ways to make yourself look good and make them look bad in comparison. You're setting yourself up against them, viewing the two of you as competitors rather than teammates. This is a breakdown in communication because you're focusing on what they do or don't do that you don't like, rather than talking about any problems in your relationship. [6] X Research source For example, you might start doing more household chores so that you can claim that you do all of the work around the house while they just sit around watching TV. This pattern can make you feel better about yourself temporarily, but you feel worse about them. The more you criticize them, the more your negative opinion of them grows."

Instead, whenever you try to talk to your spouse, you feel like you're talking to a brick wall. They might even agree with you and promise that things will change, but then nothing ever really does. [7] X Research source One or both of you is in a defensive position at this point. Anything your spouse suggests is going to feel like an attack (and vice versa). You can still recover things at this point, but only if you're both willing to put some work in and be honest with each other."

      "title": "Defensiveness",
      "content": "Defensiveness At this stage, you and your spouse feel as though you're acting against each other rather than as a team. Anything you say to your spouse will likely result in them throwing up walls or turning the issue around and placing the blame on you. Any \"win\" for your spouse can feel like a loss for you. One way to combat defensiveness is with \"I\" statements. When you speak to your spouse, tell them how you feel rather than what they're doing that bothers you. For example, you might say \"I feel taken for granted when I have to do the dishes all the time.\""

      "content": "Contempt Once you and your spouse get to the point where you feel contempt for each other, you're in the final stage, and the one that's the most predictive of divorce. Not only do you feel as though you and your spouse are against each other, but you feel as though they're the bad one—they're the one in the wrong. Once your marriage has reached this stage, it's really hard to turn the corner unless you seek professional help. But with marriage counseling, it's possible to turn your contemptuous relationship into a healthy, loving relationship again."

[8] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source For example, you might be arguing about how your spouse always leaves their dirty dishes in the sink, but the fight isn't really about the dishes—it's about how you feel as though your spouse is taking you for granted or not appreciating the things you do."

[9] X Research source Use \"I\" statements to communicate your thoughts and feelings. For example, you might say, \"I feel taken for granted and unappreciated when you leave dishes in the sink.\" Validate each other's feelings so that you both feel heard.

      "title": "Work on problems one at a time.",
      "content": "Work on problems one at a time. If your marriage is truly falling apart, it's likely that you have more than one issue you need to work on. Work with your spouse to identify the most important thing and work on that first. Then move on to the next thing. If you try to fix everything all at once, you're likely to get overwhelmed. [10] X Research source Your issues are likely interconnected, so working on one thing will make other things easier. It might even be that working on one thing enables something else to fall into place without a lot of effort. For example, if you've had a breakdown in physical affection and also problems with finances, you might start with physical affection. Increasing physical affection also shores up your bond and makes you feel more like a team, so you're ready to tackle your finances together."

Often, when you start arguing, you start looking at issues as being a matter of one of you winning and one of you losing. But that's not reality! Ultimately, you're in this together and both of you will benefit from finding compromises that work for the greater good. [11] X Research source For example, if you feel like your spouse is assuming you'll do most of the housekeeping, you might feel as though any chore you have to do means they win. But creating a schedule of tasks and splitting them equitably means you both win."

A lot of times, marriages seem like they are falling apart when really it's just that you aren't listening to each other. For example, you might say, \"I don't feel as though our problems are really about household chores. How do you feel when you come home in the evenings? What can I do to make things better for you?\" Practice active listening and show your spouse that you care by validating their feelings.

Open and honest communication is the best way to get to the root of why things don't feel like they once did. But if your spouse won't communicate with you at all, there's nothing you can do to make the relationship better. For example, if you bring up the disconnect and say that things have felt off to you, but your spouse insists that they haven't noticed anything and feel like everything's just fine, you're likely not going to be able to salvage the marriage. Being able to share painful emotions can bring the two of you closer. But if you don't feel comfortable doing that, there's not much else you can really do to save the marriage at that point."
