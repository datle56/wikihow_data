[1] X Expert Source Sydney Axelrod Certified Life Coach Expert Interview. 30 June 2020. Try not to be to general and make sure that you are making the goal for yourself, not to impress someone else. Whether your goal is long-term or short term, most people start out with only a general idea of what they want. You move from the general to the specific by adding details and defining your terms.

Decision Making: Descriptive, Normative and Prescriptive Interactions, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 398-421. (Chapter 18) For example, maybe your initial goal is be healthier. Knowing that will be your basis for creating a more specific goal."

So, your task at this stage is to translate your thoughts from step one into something more precise. Following the example in the previous step, you would ask yourself what \"healthier\" means to you? What in your life needs to be better? [4] X Expert Source Sydney Axelrod Certified Life Coach Expert Interview. 30 June 2020. The goal has to be concrete and clear. Including numbers such as \"I will go to the gym twice a week\", can help. Nebulous and fluffy goals like \"feel better\" or \"look better\" are not easy to determine progress. Pick a goal that will be measurable . Examples: Lose or gain (x) amount of weight. Be able to run a 5K Cut sodium intake in my diet"

      "content": "Determine who is involved. A good way to make certain your goal is specific enough is to answer the 5 \"W\" questions: Who, What, When, Where, and Why. Start by asking who is involved. [5] X Research source Typically goals will center around you. But, some goals will require you to work with or for others. Example: Losing weight will naturally be you, but you may realize you need help of a nutritionist, a walking partner, and the support of your spouse to see it through."

[6] X Research source If you want to lose weight be specific! How much weight do you hope to lose? What is the smart amount? This means figuring out what is a healthy goal weight for you. Self-improvement goals like \"gain confidence\" is too fuzzy and broad, but something like, \"Give the keynote speech at the conference\", \"ask out Chris to dinner\", or \"ride a subway\" are all specific things that when accomplished will demonstrate self-confidence.

[8] X Research source If you want to lose weight, you could exercise at work (going for a walk during lunch hour), at home (doing a home body weight workout or using weights), and at a gym. 'Where' can be physical or virtual such as on-line. For instance, it does not matter if you find a date by meeting prospective matches by first meeting them on-line or in real life."

[9] X Research source This will come more sharply into focus later in the process of goal setting. For now, just think about the big picture. Goals can always be extended if needed, but having a timeframe avoids having fuzzy and vague plans to do things. If your goal is to lose 20 pounds, you might be able to achieve that in a few months. On the other hand, if your goal is to get a degree in physics, a reasonable time frame for that might be a few years. In the example of achieving fitness, this may mean a reasonable time frame to lose weight, but also mean figuring out when you work out during the day, and considering how often."

What obstacles will you face? [10] X Research source If your goal is to lose weight, the requirements might be exercise and a healthy diet. The obstacles might include your own aversion to exercise. Recognize this, and consider how and why do you want to overcome that? Other obstacles: You may not have money for a gym, or a bad knee, or it is not a great neighborhood to walk outside at night.

For example, imagine your goal is to lose 50 pounds. You hope to have more friends that way because you will feel better about yourself. But getting more friends has no direct correlation with weight loss. In that case, work on trying to be more outgoing, rather than on your appearance. But if losing 50 pounds will greatly benefit your health, and you know why, write the reasons down."

Your criteria can be quantitative (numbers based) or descriptive (based on describing a certain outcome). [14] X Research source When possible, put concrete numbers in your goals. This way you'll know without question if you're falling behind or if you're on track. For example, if your goal is to lose weight, you might make your goal quantitative by saying you want to lose 30 pounds. Knowing your existing weight, it will be easy to determine when you've met your goal. A descriptive version of this goal might be \"I want to be able to put on a pair of jeans I wore five years ago.\" Either way, your goal is measurable."

On the other hand, if a month has passed and you've only lost a pound, this might signal that it's time to change your strategy. Keep a journal. This is a great way to keep track of the efforts you've made, the results you've seen, and your feelings about the process. Aim to write in it for about 15 minutes a day.

Consider the restraints and obstacles you've identified and whether you'll be able to overcome them. To achieve any goal, you will face challenges. The question to consider here is whether it's reasonable to think you'll be able to accomplish the goal in the face of these challenges. Be realistic about the amount of time you have to devote to your goals as well as your personal background, knowledge, and any physical limitations. Think about your objective realistically, and if you do not think you can reasonably achieve it given your current life situation, set a new one that is attainable for you in the present. For example, imagine your goal is to lose some weight. If you can commit even a small amount of time to exercise each week and are willing to make some dietary changes, losing 20 pounds in 6 months is probably achievable. Losing 50 pounds might or might not be, especially if there are obstacles that could prevent you from exercising regularly. It's a good idea to write down all the foreseeable constraints you face as you make this assessment. This will help you develop a complete picture of the task you face."

Ask yourself the following questions: Are you prepared to make the commitment to reach your target? Are you willing to dramatically alter or at least adjust aspects of your life? If not, is there a more achievable target you are willing to work for? Your goal and your commitment level should match up. [18] X Research source You might find it easier to commit to losing 20 pounds for starters, but 50 pounds might seem more overwhelming.

The question to ponder here is whether this goal will be fulfilling for you as individual. [20] X Research source This is a moment to revisit the \"why\" question. Ask yourself whether this goal will truly fulfill your desires or if there's a different goal that's more important to you. For example, imagine you are considering what you want to do after high school. You might be capable of getting your medical degree at a large, prestigious university. The goal is achievable for you. But, if your goal is to be a Broadway dancer, it does not matter what you could do. Getting into a pre-med program will hinder your dance career, and you would not succeed in the medical field, either."

But, you also want to take over the family business in the next couple of years. Especially if the business isn't located near an ivy league college, this creates a conflict.

Especially if your goal is very long-term, it can be useful to break it up into smaller goals. This can help you measure your progress and make it manageable. For example, if your goal is to lose 20 pounds in the next 5 months, you would set a benchmark goal of about one pound a week. This is less daunting and creates an incentive for consistent effort, rather than a big push to lose weight during the last couple of months. You can get an app that tracks your diet and exercise to make sure you're taking the necessary steps to reach your goal every day. And, if this turns out to be too much for you, you can go back and revise the goal to make it more achievable."

Another might be switching to healthy snacks like fruit and nuts, rather than potato chips. What can I do over the next 3 weeks to reach my goal? Here, the answer might involve creating a detailed meal plan or a workout schedule. What can I do over the long term to reach my goal? Here, your focus will be on keeping the weight off. Your focus will be on forming habits that promote a healthy diet and active lifestyle over the long term. You might consider, for example, joining a gym or sports team."
