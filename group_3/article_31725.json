      "content": "Use a flathead screwdriver if you don’t have a paint can opener. While a paint can opener is the best way to open a paint can, you can also use a screwdriver. Be careful not to put too much pressure on the lid when using a screwdriver, or it can get deformed. [1] X Research source For best results, use a screwdriver with a tip about 1 ⁄ 4 – 1 ⁄ 2 in (0.64–1.27 cm) big. If you use a smaller screwdriver, opening the can may put too much pressure on the rim of the can and it can get deformed. If your lid is deformed, it will be harder to close and take off next time."

      "content": "Hold your tool under the lip of the lid to easily pry it off. Place the tip of your tool underneath the lip. If using a screwdriver or putty knife, it is helpful to use the side of the tool to gain more leverage. [2] X Research source If the paint is new, you can use anything to open it from a quarter or your keys, to the back of a fork or knife.

      "title": "Press down on the handle of the tool to pry open the lid.",
      "content": "Press down on the handle of the tool to pry open the lid. After you position your tool under the lid, use moderate force on the handle. With a little bit of effort, the lid will separate from the paint can. [4] X Research source If the lid does not come off the can in 1 motion, reposition your tool and try again."

      "title": "Open the paint can a little bit at a time to maintain the shape of the lid.",
      "content": "Open the paint can a little bit at a time to maintain the shape of the lid. Continue prying the lid off in a consecutive motion. To do this, scoot the tool across the lid and lift up every 1 ⁄ 2 –1 in (1.3–2.5 cm) or so. Prying all of the lid off before opening the can prevents the lid from getting deformed and bent. [5] X Research source Even if you're opening an old can of paint, you'll want to slowly and methodically work your way around the lid as you open it because there may be rust on the edges and you don't want to get that inside the paint. [6] X Expert Source Patrick Coye Painting Specialist Expert Interview. 19 August 2020. If the lid loses its flat shape, it will be hard to put the lid back on. If you take the lid off from 1 side, you will bend it."

      "title": "Take the lid off with your hands.",
      "content": "Take the lid off with your hands. Once you pry the lid off all the way around, place 1 hand on the lid, and gently lift up. Put the lid down on a flat surface with the paint side facing upwards. [7] X Research source This way, you can easily pick up the lid when you are finished painting. If there is rust in your paint, you can strain it out with a standard paint strainer. [8] X Expert Source Patrick Coye Painting Specialist Expert Interview. 19 August 2020."

      "title": "Try a stiff, 1–2 in (2.5–5.1 cm) putty knife as an alternative opening tool.",
      "content": "Try a stiff, 1–2 in (2.5–5.1 cm) putty knife as an alternative opening tool. In addition to paint can removers and screwdrivers, putty knives work well to open paint cans. If you choose a putty knife, use the side of the knife to maximize your surface area. [9] X Research source These work well because you can easily pry the lid off with the thick, wide blade of the putty knife."

      "content": "Select a paint can opener for the easiest option. Paint can openers are small tools designed to effortlessly pry the lid off of your can. When you buy your paint from a home supply store, ask the associate for a paint can opener as well. Oftentimes they give these out for free along with the purchase of your paint. [10] X Research source Paint can openers are also available for purchase at most home supply stores. Paint can openers have a small, curved tip that easily gets underneath the lip of the paint can so you can lift it up."

      "content": "Wipe the rim of the can with a paint brush to remove any excess paint. When you are finished painting, hold the tip of your brush up to the rim of your can, and move it around in a circle. Then, wipe the tip of your brush against the lid. This moves the paint on the rim back into the can. [11] X Research source This way, your lid will not get sticky with paint. Alternatively, you can use a rag instead of a paintbrush."

      "content": "Tap the lid into place using a hammer or rubber mallet. Once the lid is in place, make small tapping motions on the lid. Continue tapping around the lid clockwise until the lid is securely in place. [13] X Research source For best results, use a tool with a small head. You don’t need to pound the lid into place, and you can more easily tap the lid closed using a small tool."
