[7] X Research source Some cheaper music distributor plans may limit the quality of the mp3 file you are allowed to upload. If uploading MP3 files, make sure they're at least 320 kbps. Some distributors may limit file sizes for audio uploads.

Fill out these forms and all metadata for your music as completely as possible. Are you uploading an album or a series of singles?
