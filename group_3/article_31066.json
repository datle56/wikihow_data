      "content": "Mop no more than once a week. If your floors get particularly dirty thanks to children, pets, or lots of foot traffic, you may need to mop them every week. However, for most houses, try to mop your hardwood floors around twice a month. [1] X Research source Mopping too often can create a sticky floor residue that traps in dirt and debris."

      "content": "Clear the area of furniture. Before mopping, remove any tables, chairs, throw rugs, and similar objects from the area you intend to clean. You do not need to move large furniture items like couches or bookshelves unless you plan to mop under or behind them. [2] X Research source If you need to clean any of these items, do so before you move them. That way, if dust or debris falls on the floor, you can clean it up before you start mopping. Avoid dragging furniture like tables and chairs so you don’t scratch up the floor. If you have roommates, tell them what area you’ll be mopping so they know to stay away for a bit. If you have any animals, move them to a separate room until you’re completely finished."
