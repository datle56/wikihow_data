      "content": "Use a measuring tape to record the length from crotch to ankle. Start measuring at the top of your thigh down your leg to the top of your shoe, which should be around your ankle bone. This is your inseam , or leg length, size. [2] X Research source If you're having trouble taking your inseam, try measuring a pair of pants that fit you well. Lay the pants flat, then measure from the center of the crotch all the way down the inner leg seam to the hem of the pants. That's your inseam measurement.

      "content": "Keep in mind that inseam may vary based on the style. Most brands offer different inseam styles within a certain waist size like short, regular, and tall. Shorter styles may rest above your ankle, while longer styles may end at or below the ankle. Men's jeans, in particular, are varied in inseam size. Read the label carefully and make sure your inseam size matches the jeans you want before buying them. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Do not pull the measuring tape too tightly around your body. When measuring your waist, hip, and thigh size, avoid pulling the tape tightly to get a smaller reading. For the most comfortable jeans fit, you will want to take loose and relaxed measurements. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Take measurements along the widest part of your thighs . Like hip measurements, your thigh size will likely not be needed unless you are getting jeans tailored.

Record your waist/inseam measurement and keep it on hand while shopping for jeans so you can reference it as needed. [8] X Research source Keep your thigh and hip measurements close as well if you are ordering customized jeans or getting your jeans altered. Most brands will use their own sizing chart, so check the website to compare your measurements to their sizes.

Although men's jeans are usually ordered by waist/inseam (ie: \"26/28, 28/30, etc...\"), women's jeans are usually assigned a number based on their waist/inseam measurements (ie: \"0, 2, 4...\"). Check the brand's sizing chart beforehand to determine which number corresponds to your waist/inseam measurements. [10] X Research source Even if 2 pairs of pants from different brands are assigned the same number, they may have completely different waist/inseam measurements."

Depending on the fit, a brand's size may fit tightly or more loosely on your body. Choose a fit that you like so your jeans don't only fit well but feels comfortable and looks flattering. [11] X Research source The amount of stretch in the jeans will also affect the fit. Jeans with more stretch will be more forgiving with sizing, whereas denim without stretch is more rigid.
