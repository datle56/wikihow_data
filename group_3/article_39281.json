      "title": "Wipe down the sword with a rag.",
      "content": "Wipe down the sword with a rag. This removes any dust, oil, or residue on the blade that could get in the way of the sharpening process. [1] X Research source Be extremely careful during this step because one wrong move could cut you. Pay close attention to what you’re doing and run the rag up the blade very gently. Don't apply pressure."
    },
    {
      "title": "Lay the sword on a table with the blade propped up.",
      "content": "Lay the sword on a table with the blade propped up. Use a block of wood to elevate the blade and make it easier to work on. Place this block under the blade near the tip of the sword. [2] X Research source This table should be completely stable. Fix any wobbling before you start working on your sword. Make sure there is plenty of light in the area so you can see what you’re doing and avoid cuts."
    },
    {
      "title": "File the blade at a 30-degree angle.",
      "content": "File the blade at a 30-degree angle. Use a metal file and apply even strokes to one side of the blade. Run the file up the blade smoothly and maintain this 30-degree angle. This filing should gradually shape an edge on the blade. [3] X Research source Depending on the length of the blade, you can divide the blade into ½ or 1/3 sections and focus on each section individually. After filing both sides, continue to the next section. Keep your fingers safely away from the sword blade to avoid cuts. Pay attention so you always know where your fingers are relative to the blade."
    },
    {
      "title": "Alternate sides of the blade regularly.",
      "content": "Alternate sides of the blade regularly. Filing is meant to form a rough edge on the blade. For an even edge, both sides of the blade require equal work. Keep close track of your strokes. Switch sides after every few strokes to ensure both sides get an even filing. [4] X Research source It helps to count your strokes and switch after a certain amount. For example, you could count 10 strokes on one side, then flip the sword and count 10 on the other side."
    },
    {
      "title": "Stop filing when an edge appears.",
      "content": "Stop filing when an edge appears. The filing process shaves metal away and reveals the natural edge in the sword. The edge will be very rough at this point, but don’t worry. You’ll sharpen it later on. Right now, it’s important that the blade develops a discernible and even edge. [5] X Research source Don't test your blade for sharpness at this point. It hasn't been fully sharpened yet and needs further work."
    },
    {
      "title": "Use a medium-grit sharpening stone.",
      "content": "Use a medium-grit sharpening stone. Sharpening stones, or whetstones, come in a wide variety of grit levels ranging from very coarse (200 or below) to extremely fine (8000). A medium grit, around 1000 to 1500, should cover most normal sharpening needs. [6] X Research source A very coarse grit would be used to fix cracks or breaks in a blade. A very fine grit would be used to make a cutting knife razor sharp. Sharpening stones are available in the knife section of many sporting goods stores. There are also specialized websites that sell sharpening equipment."

    {
      "title": "Apply a thin layer of honing oil to the stone.",
      "content": "Apply a thin layer of honing oil to the stone. Using either a water or oil-based sharpening fluid helps lubricate the stone and helps the sharpening process. Apply enough so there is a thin pool visible on the stone’s surface. [7] X Research source This type of oil is sold in many sporting goods or gun stores. Ask an employee for help if you can't find the right product. If using a Japanese water stone, wet the stone with water instead of using oil. [8] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Run the sword back and forth on the stone at a 30-degree angle.",
      "content": "Run the sword back and forth on the stone at a 30-degree angle. Maintain this angle and use smooth, uniform strokes. Apply consistent pressure when you sharpen the blade to maintain an even edge. Be patient during the process. It could take an hour or more to cover the entire blade.. [9] X Research source Depending on the length of the blade, you can divide the blade into ½ or 1/3 sections and focus on each section individually. After filing both sides, continue to the next section. Maintain the back and forth motion to ensure the blade gets an even edge. Keep your hand on the blunt side of the sword as you guide it across the stone. If you have a two-sided sword, wear specialized gloves to avoid cuts."
    },
    {
      "title": "Apply the same amount of strokes to each side.",
      "content": "Apply the same amount of strokes to each side. This ensures that the edge will be even and sharp. Count the number of strokes you apply to one side and apply the same amount to the other. Flip the blade after every few strokes to keep your blade consistent. [10] X Research source The number of strokes will vary depending on the type of sword you use. Check periodically to see if an edge is forming for an indication on how the sharpening is progressing. Test the blade periodically as well. Wipe the blade and see if it cleanly slices through a piece of paper. If there is any ripping or tearing, the blade isn’t ready yet."

    {
      "title": "Re-oil the stone when the oil gets murky.",
      "content": "Re-oil the stone when the oil gets murky. As you sharpen, residue from the blade and stone will discolor the oil. Wipe it off when this happens, and re-apply a fresh layer. [11] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Blend the edge with 400 grit sandpaper.",
      "content": "Blend the edge with 400 grit sandpaper. Tear off a small, 2 inch by 2 inch piece of sandpaper. Then run the sandpaper up the blade on both sides at a 30-degree angle. This final step blends the edge with the rest of the sword and gives it a clean finish. Be extremely careful during this step. Your blade is now sharpened and any slips could result in a serious cut. Wearing gloves will help keep you safe."

    {
      "title": "Wipe down the blade with a damp cloth.",
      "content": "Wipe down the blade with a damp cloth. This removes any leftover oil, residue, and metal shavings. Then dry the blade with a different cloth to complete the process. [12] X Research source Leaving residue behind could result in rust forming on your blade, so make sure you’ve cleaned it thoroughly."

    {
      "title": "Get a blade sharpening tool.",
      "content": "Get a blade sharpening tool. Sharpening tools usually have a V-shaped notch that you can run a blade back and forth in. They’re designed to make sharpening easier and faster than sharpening by hand. These tools won’t give you as sharp or fine of an edge as sharpening by hand will, but they’re excellent for beginners who are still learning about sword care. [13] X Research source Sporting goods stores and online sites sell a variety of sharpening tools, so start looking here. These tools are common in restaurant kitchens. If you don’t know where to start, a website that sells kitchen equipment may help. Don’t be shy about consulting an expert at a sporting goods store if you aren’t sure which product is best for you."

      "title": "Put the sharpening tool on a firm, secure surface.",
      "content": "Put the sharpening tool on a firm, secure surface. If the tool moves or wobbles while you’re sharpening, you could slip and cut yourself. Make sure both the tool and the surface are secure before starting. [14] X Research source Different sharpening tools have different mechanisms for staying in place. Some clamp to a tabletop, some connect to a vice, and some don’t secure at all, meaning you have to press down as you sharpen to hold it in place. Whatever the mechanism your blade sharpener uses, follow all instructions that come with it."

    {
      "title": "Run the blade through the sharpening tool.",
      "content": "Run the blade through the sharpening tool. Start at the base of the blade and smoothly pull the blade through the tool. Use even strokes to get a sharp edge. [15] X Research source The needed amount of sharpening time varies depending on the tool you use. Common advice is 10 minutes for each side of the blade. Keep your fingers on the blunt side of the blade while you guide it through the sharpening tool. If you have a two-sided sword, wear specialized gloves to avoid cuts."

[16] X Research source Leaving residue behind could result in rust forming on your blade, so make sure you’ve cleaned it thoroughly. Be extremely careful while wiping the blade. It's now sharpened and cant seriously injure you. Don't apply any pressure while you wipe it. Simply run the rag up the blade."
