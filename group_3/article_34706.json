The drivers foot should remain in this position until step 6. Just FYI, if the battery is dead and you have a fuel-injected vehicle that’s out of gas, you will not be able to push start the car. There’s no reserve fuel or pressurized fuel to start the engine with."

(Regularly turning the key here would initiate the starter) [1] X Research source Once the starter has failed to start the vehicle, the driver should shift into a gear. The car will now need to move by the use of physical force. One can either use gravity (hills) to their advantage or have the car pushed by someone else. Ask a passenger if they are willing to help push."

Make sure that it is safe to move the vehicle and take into account any affects gravity will have on the vehicle. Release the hand brake and have the car pushed or let it roll down a hill.

This is done by releasing the clutch pedal in it's entirety for a second or less and then pressing it back all the way down at a quick speed. If your foot is left off the clutch pedal for over a 2 seconds the car will stop moving and the battery will remain dead. [3] X Research source"
