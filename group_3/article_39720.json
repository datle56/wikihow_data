Therefore, addition and subtraction are treated as versions of the same process. To add two or more complex numbers, first just add the real portions of the numbers together. [1] X Research source For example, to simplify the sum of (a+bi) and (c+di), first identify that a and c are the real number portions, and add them together. Symbolically, this will be (a+c). Using actual numbers instead of variables, consider the example of (3+3i) + (5-2i). The real portion of the first number is 3, and the real portion of the second complex number is 5. Add these together to get 3+5=8. The real portion of the simplified complex number will be 8."

[2] X Research source For the algebraic example of (a+bi) plus (c+di), the imaginary portions are b and d. Adding these together algebraically gives the result (b+d)i. Using the numerical example of (3+3i) + (5-2i), the imaginary portions of the two complex numbers are 3i and -2i. Adding these gives the result of 1i, which can also be written just as i."

Applying the numerical example, the sum of (3+3i) + (5-2i) is 8+i."

      "content": "Remember the F-O-I-L rule. Looking at a complex number (a+bi) should remind you of binomials from Algebra or Algebra 2. Remember that to multiply binomials, you need to multiply each term of the first binomial by each term of the second. A shorthand version for doing this, is the F-O-I-L rule, which stands for “First, Outer, Inner, Last.” For an example of (a+b)(c+d), apply this rule as follows: [4] X Research source First. The F in FOIL means that you multiply the first term of the first binomial by the first term of the second binomial. For the sample, this would be a*c. Outer. The O in FOIL tells you to multiply the “outer” terms. These are the first term of the first binomial and the second term of the second binomial. For the sample, this would be a*d. Inner. The I in FOIL means to multiply the “inner” terms. These would be the two terms that appear in the middle, which are the second term of the first binomial and the first term of the second binomial. In the given example, the inner terms are b*c. Last. The L in FOIL represents the last terms of each binomial. For the sample expression, this would be b*d. Finally, add all four products together. The result for the sample binomial multiplication of (a+b)(c+d) is ac+ad+bc+bd."

For example, the product of the two complex numbers (3+2i)*(5-3i) works as follows: [5] X Research source First. The product of the first terms is 3*5=15. Outer. The product of the outer terms is 3*(-3i). This product is -9i. Inner. The product of the two inner terms is 2i*5. This product is 10i. Last. The product of the last terms is (2i)*(-3i). This product is -6i 2 . Recognize that i 2 equals -1, so the value of -6i 2 is -6*-1, which is 6."
