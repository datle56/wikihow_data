If you are working in a well-ventilated area (outside or in an open, separate garage), you can use a stripper with methylene chloride. This will make the process much faster. You will need a respirator if working with this kind of paint stripper. [6] X Research source You will also need absorbent material. Finely ground clay is most effective. If you donâ€™t have access, you can crush up cat litter into a powder. To finish the cleanup job, you will need a stiff brush and scouring powder."

One form of blasting is soda blasting, which uses baking soda as the scouring agents. Soda blasting is also much more environmentally-friendly than using chemicals, and will not damage the concrete underneath. [7] X Research source"

The baking powder that you buy at the grocery store is too fine to use in a soda blaster. The proper powder should be available where you rent the blaster, but can also be ordered online. Most standard sand blasters cannot work with soda. You will need to obtain a specialized soda blaster in order to use sodium bicarbonate."

      "title": "Blast the painted area.",
      "content": "Blast the painted area. Work slowly, holding the nozzle about a foot and a half away from the ground. Be sure to wear a respirator to avoid inhaling particles. Move the nozzle evenly across the painted area to make sure that no paint gets left behind. If blasting near vegetation, be sure to avoid getting excess particles on plants. The high pH soda can cause browning and death in flowers and bushes. If you have a lot of paint to remove, consider hiring a professional blaster. The amount of blasting material needed and the size of the blasting unit will most likely be far too much to afford on your own."
