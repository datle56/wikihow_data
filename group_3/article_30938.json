It's a little easier to mingle when you already have an \"in,\" like a friend, coworker, or acquaintance who can introduce you to a few other people. If you don't know anyone else at the party or event, that's totally okay. You can still mingle. But, there's nothing wrong with using your existing relationships to help you ease into a slightly awkward social setting. [1] X Research source Don't make it too obvious that you're looking for people you know. You don't want to appear closed off to making new friends. In other words, try not to look like you are only looking for one person. Look around calmly and casually. Enjoy the view, but as you do this, do a quick scan around the room to see if you already know people. If you see someone you know, but they're talking to someone else, wait for a bit of a lull before catching the person's eye and walking over."

      "content": "Look for smaller groups. When you're in a room full of people you don't know very well, it may be easier to walk up to a smaller group of people than a big one. Look for groups that seem to be having friendly, casual conversations. Check out people's body language. If they're practically standing shoulder to shoulder in a huddle, they may not be open to meeting new people. If their body language is open and friendly they may have relaxed postures, with arms and legs uncrossed and no barriers between them. If they seem calm and accessible, walk up to them and introduce yourself. It might feel awkward, but everyone does this at parties and social gatherings. Most people will be really friendly and welcoming to you. If people ignore you or somehow seem unwelcoming, you can politely excuse yourself and find another group to join. Steer clear of people who seem to be having an intense one-on-one conversation. Chances are your presence could bring about an awkward silence. You can tell if they are in an intense one-on-one conversation by watching body language. If they are leaning into each other, gesturing wildly, and maintaining intense eye contact, you probably shouldn’t interrupt."

Stand near the middle of the room, rather than hanging out near the edges. Have a pleasant look on your face that tells people you're approachable. Chances are someone will walk up and say hello so you don't have to. When someone does approach you, be courteous and friendly. Avoid your cell phone. When people are uncomfortable or don't know what to do, many get on their cell phones. Try to avoid this since it might look like you're trying to avoid social interaction.

If you don't make the effort to smile, the majority of people won't risk coming up to you to talk, because you're not making it seem easy. Smiling doesn't come naturally for everyone. For many, a solemn look feels more comfortable. If you're one of those people, you'll need to get out of your comfort zone a bit. Smiling is a huge part of body language that typically sends the message you are receptive and open to people and their conversations. Make sure your smile looks genuine. Smile with your whole face, including your eyes, not just your mouth. Think Julia Roberts, not jack-o-lantern. Practice smiling before you go to a party. Not only will it give you an impression of how your smile looks, so you can make adjustments, but it will also put you in a good mood. This will make you more likely to want to smile."
