      "title": "Start with a clean, dry brush.",
      "content": "Start with a clean, dry brush. That is, don't add any water to the brush before you use it. Pour out white paint on your palette. Add a little bit of white to the brush."

      "title": "Decide where you want your clouds to go.",
      "content": "Decide where you want your clouds to go. You can do a landscaped painting with clouds just at the top. Alternatively, you can have the clouds be the whole painting."

      "content": "Brush the white on in light strokes. In gentle curving motions, brush the white onto the canvas. Keep the pressure light."

    {
      "title": "Expand the edges.",
      "content": "Expand the edges. Push the edges of the cloud out with your brush. Try to create the edges when you're running out of paint. That technique will give the clouds softer, feathery edges."

      "title": "Wait for the white to dry.",
      "content": "Wait for the white to dry. It will make it easier to add the shading underneath."

      "title": "Add shading.",
      "content": "Add shading. Create a grey for the shading. You can create a dark purple to use for grey with a deep blue, a rosy color, and a brown-red color. You can also create your own grey combination."
    },
    {
      "title": "Use a different dry brush.",
      "content": "Use a different dry brush. Add a tiny bit of the grey to the brush. Wipe off any excess. Gently brush the underside of the clouds to give them depth."

    {
      "title": "Make the clouds smaller near the horizon.",
      "content": "Make the clouds smaller near the horizon. Things off in the distance look smaller, so make your clouds smaller and fuzzier as you approach the horizon. To make them fuzzier, add even less paint to your brush when you create them."

    {
      "title": "Make sure you have enough paint in your mix.",
      "content": "Make sure you have enough paint in your mix. The paint will dry about half as light as it first looks on the paper. So it should look a little brighter than is natural when you're first painting."

      "content": "Keep adding lighter layers. You want to create a fading effect towards the bottom layer. The bottom layer should be a mix of pale yellow and a light bit of blue, as you already painted the bottom yellow ocher."

      "content": "Dry the brush again. Between clouds, you will need to dry off the brush again. Otherwise, the brush will leave paint rather than absorbing it."
