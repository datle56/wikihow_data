      "title": "There are clean, straight cuts on your tire.",
      "content": "There are clean, straight cuts on your tire. When someone uses a knife to slash your tires, the blade cleanly slices through the rubber. There may be one long straight cut or multiple small cuts, but the edges will always look and feel smooth. [1] X Research source If the cut is crooked or has rougher, ragged edges, then the damage was most likely caused by wear and tear or a hazard in the road."

    {
      "title": "The damage is on the tire’s outer sidewall or rim.",
      "content": "The damage is on the tire’s outer sidewall or rim. The sidewall on a tire is where the rubber is the thinnest, so it’s easier for vandals to slash through it. As they slash your tires, they may also nick and leave damage on the rim. If the only damage is on the outer sidewall of your tire, then there’s a good chance it was slashed. [2] X Research source If you see damage on the treads, it’s usually caused by wear and tear or by running over something in the road. While it’s possible someone could slash the inner sidewalls of your tires, most people won’t go through the hassle of going under your vehicle to reach it. If you find damage there, it’s usually not intentional."

    {
      "title": "The tire is completely flat.",
      "content": "The tire is completely flat. When someone slashes your tire, the damage is large enough to deflate your tire within a few seconds. If your tire has a small puncture or has a slow leak, then it deflates much more slowly. [3] X Research source If you’re near your vehicle, you may hear a loud popping sound if someone slashes your tire. It may also trigger your vehicle’s alarm."

    {
      "title": "There may be a sharp object near your vehicle.",
      "content": "There may be a sharp object near your vehicle. If a vandal is clumsy or in a rush to get away, they may accidentally drop the knife or object they use to slash your tires. Check around your vehicle for any evidence or objects that look out of place. If there aren’t any sharp objects near your vehicle, someone could have slashed your tires and taken the tool with them. Double-check around your vehicle or any potholes, sharp curbs, or other debris on the ground that could explain the damage to your tires."

    {
      "title": "Take pictures of the damage.",
      "content": "Take pictures of the damage. Before doing anything else, take a few clear pictures of your tires from multiple angles. The police and your insurance provider will want to see the damage to determine if it was done intentionally or if there are other potential causes. It can also help to film a video walking around your vehicle to help determine if there’s a pothole, curb, or debris in the road that tore through your tire."

      "title": "Check for security cameras where you parked.",
      "content": "Check for security cameras where you parked. Look around the area where you’re parked to see if any homes or businesses have cameras nearby. Tell the person or business that you think your tires were slashed and ask if they can check the footage for any suspicious behavior. [4] X Research source If they caught someone on footage near your vehicle, ask them to send you a copy of the video for evidence."

      "title": "Ask people if they saw suspicious behavior near your vehicle.",
      "content": "Ask people if they saw suspicious behavior near your vehicle. If your tires were slashed at home, chat with your neighbors and ask if they noticed anyone out of the ordinary. If you’re parked in a public space, talk to any people or businesses nearby to see if anyone witnessed the tire slashing. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Change your tire if you need to drive right away.",
      "content": "Change your tire if you need to drive right away. If you’re in a rush to get somewhere, then put on your spare tire before you start driving. Loosen the lug nuts and jack your vehicle to remove the tire. Slide your spare tire onto the bolts and tighten the lug nuts again to start driving. [6] X Research source If you don’t have a full-sized spare tire, only use it temporarily and drive at a slow speed. Avoid driving on a flat tire because you won’t have as much control over your vehicle and you could severely damage your rims."

      "content": "Fill out a police report. Search for the name of your city followed by “police report” to find out if you can file one online or if you need to go to a station to report the crime. When you file your report , describe what happened in as much detail as you can. Include any photos, videos, or witness statements that you have to help your case. The police will reach out to you with any questions or next steps to take."

      "title": "File a claim with your auto insurance provider.",
      "content": "File a claim with your auto insurance provider. Comprehensive car insurance usually covers replacing slashed tires, but check with your insurance provider about your plan. Contact your provider and let them know what happened to your vehicle. Include pictures of your slashed tire and give details about when and where it happened. After that, your provider may send an appraiser to check your tires before approving your claim. [7] X Research source You may have to pay a deductible for the damage, but your insurance will cover any additional fees. Liability or collision insurance usually does not cover slashed tires."

      "content": "You may be able to patch small damage, but it’s best to replace your tire. If the damage is smaller than 1 ⁄ 4 in (0.64 cm), then it may be possible to fix your tire . However, if there’s a large slash or the damage is on the sidewall, it’s safest to replace the tire because your repairs will not be as strong. [8] X Research source Howard Fleischmann, an automotive tire and repair specialist, says that tires that are 6 years old or older are unsafe to repair and need to be replaced."

      "title": "No, driving on a slashed tire is unsafe and can damage your rims.",
      "content": "No, driving on a slashed tire is unsafe and can damage your rims. Your vehicle doesn’t have as much traction when you drive on a flat tire, so it’s harder to control while you’re driving. Driving on a flat also causes the rim to grind against the ground, which could leave lasting damage. Either put on the spare tire or have your vehicle towed to avoid driving on it. [9] X Research source Rim damage usually has sharp and jagged edges that can shred through a newly replaced tire."

      "title": "Punctures or damage from road hazards",
      "content": "Punctures or damage from road hazards Potholes, curbs, or items that fall off vehicles can tear through tires quickly while you’re driving. Other items, like screws and nails, may puncture and get stuck in the tire treads, and cause a slow leak that deflates your tire. [10] X Research source A puncture looks different depending on what caused it. Nail and screw punctures usually look like a small hole in the tire treads. You may even have a lodged nail head visible on your tire. Punctures from a curb or pothole may be larger and have a rougher texture around the edges."

      "title": "Old and worn tires",
      "content": "Old and worn tires As you drive more and your tires get older, the rubber starts to wear away and gets thinner. Because the material isn’t as sturdy, there’s a higher chance that your tires get damaged or blow out. [11] X Research source Worn tires tend to have rougher edges around the damage because the rubber bursts from the inside, and they tend to be on the sidewalls of your tire."

    {
      "title": "Low or high tire pressure",
      "content": "Low or high tire pressure When your tires are underinflated, then the rims rub against the insides of your tires whenever you make a turn. The constant friction could wear through the tires and make them more likely to blow out. [12] X Research source If the pressure is too high during hot months of the year, the heat can cause the tires to burst. [13] X Research source Damage caused by tire pressure has rough, torn edges near the rims or along the edges of the sidewall."

      "content": "Park in an enclosed or well-lit area. Keep your vehicle in your garage if you have one so it’s harder for someone to access it. If you need to park outside, try to find a space in a well-populated area with streetlights so it’s less likely to get targeted by vandals. [14] X Research source"

If someone sees a camera or light turn on when they approach your vehicle, they’re less likely to cause any damage. [15] X Research source Alternatively, install a dashcam inside your vehicle and set it to record whenever you park."

      "title": "Check your tires for damage or wear monthly.",
      "content": "Check your tires for damage or wear monthly. Inspect your tires thoroughly to see if they need to be replaced . Look for uneven wear on the treads, bulges in the sidewall, or small objects puncturing your tire. If you see any damage, then take your vehicle into a shop to have your tire fixed or replaced. [16] X Research source To check the tire treads , insert an upside-down penny between the treads. If the top of Lincoln’s head is visible above the treads, then it’s time to replace your tire. To check the tire’s age , look for the last 2 digits of the code printed on the sidewall to determine the year they were made. If the tires are older than 6 years, then replace them."

      "content": "Drive safely to avoid debris and potholes. Whenever you’re driving your vehicle , stay alert and pay full attention to the road. If you see debris or a pothole in the road, do your best to avoid running it over so you’re less likely to damage your tires. [17] X Research source If you do run over debris and your tire blows out, driving instructor Simon Miyerov says to remain calm and pull over to the side of the street as soon as you can."
