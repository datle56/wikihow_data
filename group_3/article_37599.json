      "content": "Check the bus routes online. Check online for your city’s bus routes to see where the nearest stops are on your route. Some city bus sites even have a route planner where you can enter your destination in. Take note of which bus you need to catch and if you’ll need to transfer buses at all along your route. [1] X Research source The bus may not take you exactly where you need to go, so you might have to walk or bike some of the way. Most buses are labeled by route and by number. For example, your bus might say, “the number 9 going downtown every 10 minutes.” Standard buses will often make a few stops along the way, while express buses may go directly to your destination."

      "content": "Plan your route from point A to point B. Once you find a bus stop near your starting point, you can plan out how you’re going to get to your destination. Find the nearest bus stop to your destination, then see which routes connect to each stop. Usually, one bus route will run east to west while another bus route will run north to south, so if you have to move diagonally, you’ll have to transfer buses. [2] X Research source A typical bus fare will cover your bus transfers within 1 hour of your initial ride. If you need to, write down each bus you’ll have to take so you don’t forget."

      "content": "Check the bus schedule. Once you know your route, you can check the timing of each bus as it comes along. Most buses come every 10 to 30 minutes, but some may have longer wait times on weekends or during holidays. Take note of how often each bus comes as well as the first and last buses of the day in case you’re out late. [3] X Research source Some bus websites have apps or text message alerts that notify you when your bus is coming. If you miss the last bus, you probably won’t be able to catch a ride on one until morning."

      "content": "Purchase a ticket online, through an app, or on the bus. If you don’t want to worry about buying your ticket on the bus, you can see if your city’s bus website has an option to purchase tickets ahead of time. If you do, make sure you keep an electronic copy of the ticket on your phone to show to the driver. If you’re purchasing your ticket on the bus, bring exact change with you on the day you plan to ride. [4] X Research source Some buses also have ticketing cards that you can load money onto. If you have cash, make sure you have exact change, as most buses don’t have cash on hand to give any back to you. A normal bus fare is usually between $1.25 and $3.00."

      "content": "Get to your bus stop about 10 minutes early. Although buses generally stick to a schedule, there is a chance yours could come early. Try to get there a little before the bus is scheduled to come just in case. [5] X Research source Your bus may also come a little bit late, so you should leave a little wiggle room in your schedule to account for that."

      "content": "Wave for the bus to stop as it approaches. If the bus is already slowing down, you don’t need to wave. However, some buses won’t stop if they don’t have anyone to let off, so you need to make it clear that you’re waiting. As you see your bus, give the driver a wave so they know you want to get on. [6] X Research source If the bus drives by without stopping, it may be full, in which case you’ll have to wait for the next one."

If all the seats are full, stand in the middle of the aisle and grab onto a handrail so you don’t fall over when the bus starts moving. [10] X Research source Some seats may be reserved for disabled, elderly, or pregnant people. You can still sit in them, but you should give them up if anyone who needs them gets on the bus. Most buses don’t allow you to eat on board, so save your snack for after you get off the bus."

Most buses have a screen at the front that displays the upcoming stop. Keep an eye out for yours so that you don’t miss your chance to get off. [11] X Research source If you do miss your stop, that’s okay. You can just get off at the next one and walk back a few blocks. Feel free to listen to headphones or read a book as you ride.

If you’d like to, you can call out a quick “Thank you!” to the driver as you exit."
