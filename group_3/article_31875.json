Place items such as your cell phone, money, ID card, house key, etc. in the pockets of the bag. Get used to distinct parts of your bag containing the same items, so that you know where to reach instinctively, even without looking."

Also, put aside things that are no longer useful, such as a grubby eraser or dog-eared exercise books with filled pages. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Get a suitable school bag. The size should be right for you and it is a good idea to try it before you buy it. If it's a backpack, try it on and check the comfort level. If it's a carrying style of bag, carry it around and get a feel for the handle, weight, and balance of the bag. Ask the retailer if it's okay to stuff the bag for trying it so that you get an idea of what it feels like when full (just use items from the back-to-school section to fill it, or stuff in a few other bags from nearby). Walk around a bit and see how the bag performs for you. You can choose a size colour and style yourself. Nowadays laptop bags are available. They can hold large items. So if you want you can buy a laptop bag also. [6] X Research source Check the stitching or seals. Does the bag look like it can last the next year or does it look like it's about to fall apart with the first fill of books and clothes?"

If not, wiping and vacuuming should do the trick. Start with an empty, clean bag. [7] X Research source Take everything out of your school bag, even if you know that you need it. Make sure all of your pockets are empty too. Make sure all the rubbish such as used tissues, rubbish wrappers, etc., is put in the bin."
