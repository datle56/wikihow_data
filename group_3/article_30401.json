This can help ensure that you heal properly and don’t develop any skin infections or irritations. You can wrap your cast in heavy plastic, such as a garbage bag or even plastic wrap. Make sure that the entire cast is wrapped and secure. You may want to put a small towel in your cast to help prevent water from leaking down the inside. Not only will this ensure the integrity of the cast, but can also help prevent skin irritations or infections. In the event that your cast gets wet, dry it with a hair dryer. This may help ensure the integrity of the cast. If the cast gets soaked, call your doctor and ask her how to proceed."
