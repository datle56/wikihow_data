It will also help to have a soft item, such as a clean microfiber towel, on which you can rest your iPhone screen side-down. Consider giving the surface a good wipe-down with a damp rag and letting it dry before you begin working on your iPhone. This will get rid of dust and other tiny bits of foreign matter."

You will need the following tools in order to open up an iPhone 7 or iPhone 6S: P2 Pentalobe screwdriver - This screwdriver is used for most iPhone repairs and teardowns. Phillips #000 screwdriver (iPhone 6 only) - Make sure this one has a + shaped head and not a flathead. Tripoint Y000 screwdriver (iPhone 7 only) - This is used for some of the iPhone 7's unique screws. Spudger - This thin, plastic lever is used to pry the display and connectors up. You can also use a similar item, such as a guitar pick. Heat source - Tech outlets provide different versions of the same general product, which is a gel- or sand-filled bag that you heat up in the microwave and then place on the iPhone to loosen the display adhesive. Suction cup - You'll need this in order to pull the iPhone's screen off. Plastic bags - These are for any screws or other components you remove. You can also use tupperware containers or bowls if need be."
