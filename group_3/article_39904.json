We're in the same English 101 class.\" Maybe you met at a party and bonded over your shared interest in graphic novels. Message him, \"Hey it's Rob! We met last weekend.

      "content": "If his story piques your interest, message him about it. Better yet, ask him a question about it to boost your chances of getting a reply. Craft a message instead of simply reacting with a fire emoji. Though he may appreciate the reaction, it won't give him much to respond to. [6] X Research source Let's say he posted a story of his cat. Message him, \"Omg so cute! What's their name?\" If he posted a picture of a popular bar in your city, try, \"I love that place. Best patio in town!\""

      "title": "Build on your first message to establish a rapport.",
      "content": "Build on your first message to establish a rapport. Avoid asking questions with yes or no answers, as these can make the conversation come to an end sooner. As you continue to message back and forth, respond with what comes naturally. It's totally normal to be a little nervous, but try not to take too much time thinking of the perfect response so you don't slow down the convo. [7] X Research source For example, if you've been talking about his interest in playing guitar, ask him something like, \"How did you first get into guitar?\" Follow that with your own experience with guitar: \"I've always wanted to play guitar, but I ended up taking piano lessons growing up instead\" or \"I play guitar, too. I like playing electric especially. What about you?\""
