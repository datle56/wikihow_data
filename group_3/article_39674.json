      "content": "It might be a red flag if he hasn’t introduced you to his friends. Capricorn men like to keep their social circles small and tightly knit. [1] X Research source When a Capricorn man is serious about you, he’ll fully let you in and introduce you to his family, buddies, co-workers, and everybody else who’s significant in his life. On the other hand, if he refuses to let you meet his loved ones, even after you’ve been dating a while, this could mean he’s trying to keep you at arm’s length (which is often a manipulation tactic). How to handle it: Communicate that you want to get to know his friends and make an effort to bond with them. Try staging a low-stakes group outing and prove to him that you all can get along. Take him and his friends somewhere with lots to do like an arcade, a pier, or a fairground. This way, if things get awkward or there are conversational lulls, you can easily find a new activity to bond over."

      "title": "It could mean trouble if a Cap man wants your love to be totally private.",
      "content": "It could mean trouble if a Cap man wants your love to be totally private. As an Earth sign, Capricorns are straightforward and practical. They don’t like to keep things secret…unless they have something to hide. Their hard-nosed personalities mean they tend to avoid expressing affection publicly, so your man may not be sharing your relationship out of shyness. However, if all of your dates are in confidential spaces, this may be worth looking at. How to handle it: Define your relationship . Ask him how he feels about your connection and communicate your expectations for you two as a couple. A healthy Capricorn man appreciates directness, so giving your relationship a label will make him trust you and allow you to clarify your future together. You might say “I notice all our dates are at home. I really like you, so I’d like to go out more as a couple. Would you be comfortable with that?” or “I’d like to start calling you my boyfriend. What do you think?"

      "title": "If a Capricorn man refuses to share, he’s keeping you at a distance.",
      "content": "If a Capricorn man refuses to share, he’s keeping you at a distance. While they’re not super comfortable with emotions, Capricorns are ruled by Saturn , the planet of responsibility. Therefore, they recognize that, for a relationship to work, they have to open up and confide in their loved ones. [2] X Research source If your man refuses to give any personal details about himself or his life, he may not see a future for your relationship. How to handle it: Try being more vulnerable yourself and leading by example. Your Capricorn man may just be guarded out of fear of rejection. By sharing your own hopes, fears, and insecurities, he’ll recognize your relationship is a safe space and match your energy."

      "title": "If he makes no effort to show affection, he might be using you.",
      "content": "If he makes no effort to show affection, he might be using you. While their Saturnian fears and responsibilities cause them to be cautious in other areas of their life, Capricorn men are passionate and fully committed when it comes to intimacy. While they aren’t big on grand gestures or PDA, they make a concerted effort to show they love you in simple ways (weekly flowers, taking care of chores you don’t want to do, etc.). Plus, they’re extremely attentive in the bedroom. If your Cap guy is none of the above, something’s off. How to handle it: Communicate your relationship needs directly and give him time to adapt. Almost all Capricorns require a learning curve when it comes to romance, so make your expectations clear and give him a few weeks to adjust. You might say “I need a lot of physical touch. If you kissed me more often, that would make me feel cared for” or “I’d love it if you gave me more words of affirmation.”"

      "title": "There's a problem if a Capricorn man doesn’t try to talk to you.",
      "content": "There's a problem if a Capricorn man doesn’t try to talk to you. While your Capricorn man isn’t likely to be super chatty himself, as a cardinal sign, he’s likely to initiate conversation and ask you questions. If he doesn’t reach out or disappears for days on end, he may be playing you. How to handle it: Schedule moments throughout the week to talk. Capricorn rules the 10th house of work, so your man may just be so busy working, he forgets to make time for connection. Carving out set conversation times each week will allow him to be fully present. It can also help to communicate in lower stakes ways throughout your day too. Consider sending each other a brief “good morning text” or leaving a sweet note in each other’s bags to show you’re thinking about each other without the pressure to reply."

      "title": "Something’s off when a Capricorn beats around the bush.",
      "content": "Something’s off when a Capricorn beats around the bush. Their earthy pragmatism and intense work ethic mean they value clear, direct communication. (Meandering is a waste of their time!) If you ask your man questions about him or your relationship and his answers are roundabout or hard to pin down, it’s likely he’s using this as a defense mechanism to avoid commitment. How to handle it: Be assertive and ask why he’s not giving you clear answers. Even if your Cap man is playing games, his Saturnian sense of honesty means he won’t lie if you ask him a question directly. Tell him you feel lonely when he hides his feelings and that you wish he’d stop. You might say “Why do you always change the subject when I ask about our future? It makes me think you might not see one.” or, “I notice you go quiet whenever our conversations get affectionate. I’d appreciate it if you were more clear about how you feel.”"

      "title": "Capricorn men are reliable unless there’s something wrong.",
      "content": "Capricorn men are reliable unless there’s something wrong. As Earth signs, Capricorn men are hypervigilant about their dependability and prioritize security in their relationships. [3] X Research source If your Capricorn man behaves erratically or he starts falling through on his commitments, this could be a sign that his trust in the relationship is wavering. How to handle it: Hold him accountable for his actions. Capricorn men vibrate with paternal energy, so they take it very seriously when someone they love feels disappointed. Calmly but clearly state that you feel disappointed and he’ll adjust his behavior accordingly. You might say “It hurt me when you bailed on our plans without warning because I like spending time with you” or “I want to trust you, but it’s difficult when you make promises you don’t keep.”"

      "title": "When Capricorns are committed, they make time for you no matter what.",
      "content": "When Capricorns are committed, they make time for you no matter what. While their workaholism often means they prioritize their career over all else, their loved ones are still an essential part of their lives. If your Cap man isn’t checking in on you regularly, this may point to a greater sense of apathy in the relationship. How to handle it: Ask for his attention directly . As a cardinal sign, independence is the default quality that Cap men project onto themselves and others. He may be assuming you don’t need him to check in or else you’d ask. Communicate that you want him to show more care and he'll adjust."

      "title": "Capricorn men only overreact when something’s wrong.",
      "content": "Capricorn men only overreact when something’s wrong. Like the goat that symbolizes them, Capricorns are generally quite stoic. They like their lives and relationships to be simple and uncomplicated. If your Capricorn man seems to constantly be picking fights or reacting with flashy confrontations, it may be because he’s looking for a way out of the relationship. How to handle it: Ask him what’s bothering him. If a Cap is behaving irresponsibly, there’s likely a larger issue at play (stress, depression, anxiety), but that doesn’t mean the relationship is the cause. Define the root of the issue and clarify that you want to help him work through it as a team."

      "title": "Capricorn men are loyal so wandering eyes are a big red flag.",
      "content": "Capricorn men are loyal so wandering eyes are a big red flag. Ruled by Saturn (the planet of obligation), Capricorns treat relationships with an almost sacred degree of responsibility. If your Cap man is teasing, courting, or hitting on other people, he may not be viewing your relationship with the respect he should. How to handle it: Clearly establish boundaries for your relationship. Define your terms as a couple and be clear that you want to be official and exclusive. Then, acknowledge the consequences (breaking up, loss of trust, etc.) if he violates these boundaries."

    {
      "title": "It could spell trouble if he offers no middle ground in your relationship.",
      "content": "It could spell trouble if he offers no middle ground in your relationship. Saturn's rulership means Capricorn men recognize that relationships aren’t perfect. When they’re serious about dating someone , they’re more than willing to reset and re-negotiate their expectations. [4] X Research source If your Saturn man is insistent that your relationship has to look a certain way and refuses to budge, he may not be ready for a relationship with you. How to handle it: Try just being friends for a while . While it may sound painful, you deserve to be with someone who values your relationship as it is, rather than how they think it should look. Recognize that his refusal to budge is a clue it’s not meant to be right now. Remember, just because it may not work right now doesn’t mean it’s done forever. Try re-negotiating after a few months to see if either of your terms for an ideal relationship has changed."
