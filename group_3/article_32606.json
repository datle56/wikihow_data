      "content": "Talk to your doctor before you perform your own enema. While it's typically safe to have an enema, it's probably still a good idea to talk to your doctor about it first. They may advise you to try other methods of relieving your constipation first, like taking a fiber supplement or an over-the-counter laxative, if you haven't already. If they do recommend an enema, they can tell you how often you should perform the enema or what to do if it doesn't relieve your constipation symptoms. In some cases, your doctor may ask you to perform an enema before you come in for a procedure like a colonoscopy."

[1] X Trustworthy Source Michigan Medicine The University of Michigan's medical center, which provides patient care, supports research, and educates the public on health topics Go to source Making your own saline solution is easy—just stir 2 tsp (12 g) of table salt into 1,000 ml (1.1 qt) of lukewarm distilled water. Purchase distilled water, as tap water may contain contaminants that you don't want to introduce into your rectum. If you're making a homemade enema solution , you'll also need to purchase an enema bag and tube . Do not add any other ingredients to the saline solution unless your doctor advises you to. Even if you see them recommended online or by your family and friends, do not put fruit juices, herbs, vinegar, coffee, or alcohol into your enema. The risks posed by introducing these substances into your colon far outweigh any potential benefits. [2] X Research source Once you've made the saline, fill the enema bag with 6 fluid ounces (180 ml) for children 2-6 years old, 12 fluid ounces (350 ml) for children 6-12 years old, and 16 fluid ounces (470 ml) for anyone 13 or older. Do not give an enema to children under the age of 2 unless directed to do so by your doctor."

      "content": "Purchase an enema kit if your doctor recommends a mineral oil or phosphate enema. Mineral oil and phosphate are both used as laxatives, so they can increase the effectiveness of your enema. Mineral oil can be less irritating than a phosphate enema, but talk to your doctor before you use either. [3] X Research source Typically, store-bought enemas come in children's and adult's sizes. Read the label carefully to ensure you get the right enema for your age and body size. Small children and older adults should not be given phosphate enemas, because they can lead to a dangerous electrolyte imbalance. [4] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Family Physicians Organization devoted to improving the health of patients, families, and communities Go to source For a mineral oil enema, the dose is 2 fluid ounces (59 ml) for children ages 2-6 and 4.5 fluid ounces (130 ml) for anyone older than 6. If you're using a phosphate enema, the dose is 1 fluid ounce (30 ml) for children who weigh 20 pounds (9.1 kg) or more, 2 fluid ounces (59 ml) for children who weigh at least 40 pounds (18 kg), 3 fluid ounces (89 ml) for someone who weighs 60 pounds (27 kg) or more, 4 fluid ounces (120 ml) for anyone 80 pounds (36 kg) lb, and 4.5 fluid ounces (130 ml) if the person weighs 90 pounds (41 kg) or more."

The bathroom is also the best place to ensure you have privacy during the procedure. To set up your area, lie several folded towels on the bathroom floor so you'll have a comfortable place to rest while you wait. Make sure there's a place nearby where you can place the enema bag while you wait, like a small stool or a hook you can hang it from.
