If you don't know your router password and are unable to log in using the default login information, Racz advises restoring your router to its original factory settings using the router's reset button. Once you do this, you'll be able to use your router's default admin password to sign in and update your settings. Usually, the button looks like a small hole that only a pin can fit into, but sometimes, you'll see a button you can press with your finger. If you have a reset hole, insert a needle-like object, such as a SIM tool, the straightened end of a paperclip, or a pin, and press inward until the router restarts.

Only use it if you cannot log in using the HUAWEI AI Life app or through the router's admin website.
