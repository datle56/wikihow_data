Connectivity options and service providers vary by area, but you'll usually find options for broadband cable, DSL, as well as satellite and fiber (FIOS). [1] X Research source It's best to contact the providers directly to find out about services available to your address. Companies that offer cable and satellite television services typically offer internet services as well. DSL services are often provided through telephone companies."

If your home isn't properly equipped for the type of internet service you're signing up for, the ISP will need to come prepare your home. [2] X Research source For example, if you don't have cable coaxial jacks but want broadband internet, you'll need a technician to come out and install a jack and prepare cable service. In many cases, the technician who comes out can also install all of the equipment necessary to get you online."

      "content": "Gather your equipment. Most ISPs (internet providers) provide all of the hardware you'll need to set up your internet connection in your home, including a modem and any necessary cables. If you choose a professional installation from the provider, they'll bring the equipment to your home and set it up for you. If you want to do it yourself, the ISP will either mail you the equipment, or allow you to come pick it up. A modem is the device that connects to the jack in your wall and essentially connects your house to the internet. A router is a secondary device that allows multiple devices to connect to the internet through the router. It's very common to receive a device that's both a modem and a router (often called a \"wireless gateway,\" which makes setup especially easy. Some ISPs offer a modem for free (you'll need to return it if you cancel service) but offer a wireless router at a small rental fee. If you want to avoid renting hardware, you can always purchase your own router, but it'll always be easiest to set up (and get tech support) if you use the equipment from your ISP."

If you're using a DSL modem (or modem/router combo), you'll need to connect it to the telephone jack using the telephone cable that came with your modem. If you're using broadband or satellite, connect your modem (or modem/router combo) to the cable jack with a coaxial cable. If you already have a device connected to the jack, you can use a splitter, which will allow you to plug two different devices into a single jack. Many providers include a splitter in their self-installation kits."

Once your modem and/or router is up and running, the remaining steps will vary depending on your internet provider and equipment. Many major providers now offer easy setup using mobile apps you can install on your Android, iPhone, or iPad. If no mobile app is available, you'll need to connect your computer to the router or modem with an Ethernet cable, and then follow your provider's instructions to configure your router through your web browser. During the setup process, you'll usually be able to create (or at least write down) your Wi-Fi access point name and password.
