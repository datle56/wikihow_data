      "content": "Purchase an HDMI adapter (if needed). Many PC graphics cards have two independent HDMI ports in order to support dual monitors. However, most PCs only have one HDMI port. Check your PC to see how many HDMI ports it has. If you are using a laptop, or your PC only has one HDMI port, you will need to purchase a USB-to-HDMI adapter. You can purchase these from most electronics stores. You can even purchase dual HDMI adapters that allow you to connect two monitors to a single USB port."

Then repeat with the next monitor. Most computer have their HDMI ports located on the back of the computer tower. If you are using a Laptop, the HDMI can usually be found on the left or right side of the keyboard. If your laptop does not have a USB port, you will need to use a USB-to-HDMI adapter. If you are using a USB-to-HDMI adapter, plug the adapter into a USB 3.0 port on your computer. Then connect the HDMI cable to the other end of the adapter. Connect the other end of the HDMI cable to one of the monitors. If your computer has a dedicated graphics card, connect your monitors to the dedicated graphics card rather than the PC's integrated HDMI port. [1] X Research source"
