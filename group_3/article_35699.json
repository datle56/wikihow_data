      "content": "Find out your specific WBC count. A count of over 11,000 WBC per microliter of blood is considered high. However, there are lots of potential causes, and slightly elevated levels are usually not a cause for concern. [1] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Counts around 30,000 can be due to physical stress, injuries, allergic reactions, infections, or medication. For example, you may have the flu. Counts between 50,000 and 100,000 usually indicate a serious infection, such as advanced pneumonia . In a person who has had an organ transplant, it could mean an organ rejection. Additionally, some tumors can cause high WBC counts, which could be either cancerous or benign. Counts above 100,000 usually mean a more serious condition that your doctor will need to diagnose. This could range from severe bronchitis to leukemia in rare cases. Many pregnant women have a WBC count of up to 15,000 in the third trimester and after giving birth, which may be normal."

      "content": "Get another complete blood count (CBC). The first step in making an accurate diagnosis is to get another CBC. If the second test shows your WBC count has returned to normal, your doctor may determine that you are healthy. If your count is still high after several days, further testing will be necessary. Depending on your count and symptoms, your doctor will recommend scheduling another CBC within a few days or after a couple of weeks. Your doctor might also order a smear test, which is when a blood sample is viewed under a microscope. A smear test can reveal if WBC are immature, abnormal, or exhibit other features that can help make an accurate diagnosis."

      "content": "Tell your doctor about any related symptoms. Symptoms like fever and coughing are obvious signs of an infection, and your doctor will order sputum cultures to identify a specific germ. Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and rheumatoid arthritis can cause high WBC counts, so let your doctor know about any digestive issues or joint pain. Additionally, your doctor needs to know if you've experienced symptoms like night sweats, fatigue, weight loss, and bruising or bleeding easily in order to make a definitive diagnosis.

      "content": "Do a light exercise after a hard workout. If you exercised just before your blood test, your high WBC count is probably due to your workout. A hard workout, intense sports, and other demanding forms of exercise can raise WBC levels by 200 to 300 percent. Those levels usually decrease rapidly within a few hours. [7] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source There's no evidence that these changes in WBC counts are dangerous, but 15 minutes of active recovery after intense exercise can help reduce rapid shifts. Active recovery is a less intense exercise that helps cool you down, like a brisk walk after a fast jog."
