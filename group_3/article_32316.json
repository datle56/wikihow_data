Some accessories automatically go into pairing mode when turned on, while others require you to press a button or select an option from a menu. You can usually figure out if an accessory, such as a speaker , is in pairing mode by checking the behavior of an LED light. For example, sometimes a light will blink on a device when it's ready for pairing. If you're not sure how to enable pairing mode, check the device's manual. \"Pairing mode\" is sometimes referred to \"discover mode\" or \"making the device discoverable.\""
