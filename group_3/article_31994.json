      "content": "Platforms that are less \"gamified\" tend to be more mindful. When developers \"gamify\" a dating app, that simply means that they're using game design elements without a game—thus turning dating itself into a game. [1] X Research source While gamification is designed to encourage users to spend more time on the app, the reality is it can also make your experience more stressful and pressured. Using game design elements can add a sense of urgency where you normally wouldn't feel one. In the romantic or sexual context, this can lead to feelings of loneliness and desperation. Research also shows that people who use swipe-based dating applications report higher levels of anxiety than those who don't. [2] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Think about what you hope to get out of the experience of using the app. Then, look for an app that caters to that goal. That'll make it more likely that you'll meet the type of people you want to meet. [3] X Research source"

There's a lot of variety out there in the dating app world, so finding an app that caters to what you're looking for can make all the difference. Apps that target a specific niche can be more comfortable than those that are hitting a broad spectrum—and you'll also be more likely to find matches. [4] X Research source For example, dating coach Laura Sanders recommends that if you're LGBTQ+, you'll have an easier time meeting members of the LGBTQ+ community on LGBTQ+-centered dating apps.

      "content": "If you have a profile you're proud of you might be less anxious. Include details that set you apart from other people—those things you would tell people about when you first meet them. You typically have limited space in a profile, so don't waste it talking about what type of person you want—instead, introduce yourself and describe how you like to spend your time and what you're passionate about. [6] X Research source For example, you might write, “I’m a geologist who is passionate about my work and loves to spend my weekend learning how to play guitar. I’m looking for someone to explore the city with me.” Set goals for your app usage and make those goals known in your profile. If you're only looking for something casual, for example, you don't want to match with someone whose goal is to find their life partner. Studies have shown that dating apps can have a negative effect on your body image. Choose photos for your profile that you love and that make you feel good about yourself.

It's easy to just sit on your couch and scroll the night away swiping profiles on a dating app, but that likely won't get you anything but bored and frustrated. Try to go out and do something at least 2 or 3 nights a week, whether it's a painting class or a community sports league—something that gets you involved in your local area meeting people who share similar interests.

Take control by setting aside a specific time of day when you'll use your dating app—then, don't log onto it or check it at any other time of the day. When you have notifications on, the app will seem to be constantly demanding your attention, which can cause a lot of stress and anxiety. [10] X Research source For example, Tinder has a notification that nudges you when there's an abnormally high app usage in your area. The idea is that if you log on then and start swiping, you're likely to have a greater number of matches than you normally would. [11] X Research source"

Some apps require you to purchase a subscription to use all of the filters, but most apps allow you to use basic filters, such as age and gender, for free. The more you can filter your search, the fewer options you'll have to go through. [12] X Research source If you're not getting enough options with your filters, which can be a problem if you live in a smaller town, try broadening your geographic range before you start dropping filters. When you're new to dating apps, scrolling through profiles can help you identify your preferences.

These groups are great ways to meet people without being put on the spot in a one-on-one conversation. [16] X Research source Group chats give you the opportunity to talk to people and make platonic connections as well as potential romantic ones. Overall, the context is designed to take some of the pressure off. You don't necessarily have to worry about impressing someone like you might if you were messaged directly."
