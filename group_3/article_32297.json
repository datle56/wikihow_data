      "content": "Mix acrylic paint in a bowl to achieve the desired shade. Measure out 2 tablespoons (30 mL) of acrylic paint and pour it into a small bowl. You can use a 50/50 mixture of 2 different colors to achieve a specific shade or add a few drops of 1 color to another to adjust the shade slightly. Mix the paint colors together well using a spoon or fork. [1] X Research source For example, you could use 1 tablespoon (15 mL) each of blue and white to create a pastel or light blue shade. Or, add a few drops of green to 2 tablespoons (30 mL) of white paint for a light mint green paint. If you don’t want to adjust the shade of your paint before coloring the inside of the mason jar, pour it directly into the jar."

      "content": "Pour the paint into a clean, dry mason jar. Wash out the jar with dish soap and water, then rinse it out thoroughly. Let the jar air-dry upside down or use a paper towel to dry it out. When the jar is dry, pour the mixed paint into the jar. [2] X Research source If you’re painting the inside of multiple jars, measure out 2 tablespoons (30 mL) of paint per jar."

      "content": "Twist and turn the mason jar to coat the inside of it. Swirl the paint around in the jar by slowly turning the jar on its side and rolling it around in your hand. Keep turning and tilting the jar until the inside of it is completely covered in paint. [3] X Research source This may take a few minutes since the paint will move slowly. However, do not use a paintbrush as this will result in an uneven appearance."

      "title": "Place the mason jar upside down on a piece of cardboard to dry.",
      "content": "Place the mason jar upside down on a piece of cardboard to dry. After the inside of the jar is completely coated with the paint, place the jar on a piece of cardboard. The excess paint will continue to drip down, so pick up the jar and move it to a different spot on the cardboard about once every 15 minutes. [5] X Research source The jar will take several hours to dry, so plan to wait 24 hours before you use the jar for decorative purposes. If you don’t have cardboard, use a few layers of newspaper or paper towel to catch the paint that drips down."

      "content": "Combine water and food coloring in a small bowl. Add 1 tablespoon (15 mL) of water into a small bowl. Then, add 20 or more drops of food coloring to the water and stir the food coloring into the water until they are well-combined. [6] X Research source You may use any color or combination of colors you like to tint the jar. Try using blue food coloring for a blue-tinted jar or red and yellow for an orange-tinted jar."

      "content": "Twist and turn the jar to coat the inside. Pick up the jar and start twisting and turning it in your hand to coat the inside of the jar. Turn the jar to the side and roll it around in your hands to get an even layer of the food coloring mixture all over the inside of the jar. [8] X Research source Do not turn the jar upside down until the inside is fully coated with food coloring. Then, pour the excess into the small bowl to use on another jar or discard it."

      "title": "Place the jar upside down on a paper towel to dry.",
      "content": "Place the jar upside down on a paper towel to dry. Use 2 to 3 layers of paper towel to catch any excess glue that drips down while the jar is drying. Pick the jar up every 15 minutes for the first hour to prevent the glue from collecting and adhering to the paper towel. Then, turn the jar right side up and let the jar dry overnight. If you don’t have paper towels, you can also use a few sheets of newspaper or a piece of cardboard to catch the glue. Make sure to keep the jar away from pets and children while it dries."
