      "title": "Pronounce Louis Vuitton like “Lwee VwitOH.”",
      "content": "Pronounce Louis Vuitton like “Lwee VwitOH.” In French, Louis is said very quickly (almost like one syllable) and sounds like “Lwee” in English (the S is silent). In Vuitton , the U gets pronounced like a soft W and the I gets an “ee” sound (like “Vwee”). [1] X Research source The ending -on has a silent N, so it sounds like a nasally “low” or “oh” syllable. [2] X Research source Pronouncing ou : Say the English O (as in “snow”), then purse your lips close together and start saying the English E (as in “free”) without moving your mouth. The combo of O and E sounds odd to English speakers but is the sound you'll want to use for Louis . Pronouncing Vui : Try to keep your lips from pursing too closely so you don’t dig into the W sound too much for the letter U. The “ee” sound for letter I should be very quick, so if it ends up sounding a little like the I sound in “thin,” it's OK. Pronouncing -tton : To sound French, “nasalize” the vowel by pronouncing it partly with your nose. Stop your lips from pursing like they would for the English O sound and keep your mouth open slightly with your tongue in the middle of your mouth."

      "title": "English speakers commonly pronounce it like “Loo-ee Vit-ahn.”",
      "content": "English speakers commonly pronounce it like “Loo-ee Vit-ahn.” The name Louis sounds just like the male English name (like Louis Armstrong). The syllable Vuit gets simplified to “Vit” (rhymes with “fit”) and -ton becomes “tahn” (rhymes with “brawn”). Unlike in French, the N at the end of the word gets pronounced in English. If you want to sound fancy with a fake French accent , pronounce -ton like “toh” (almost rhymes with “thaw”). This isn't quite how the French say it, but it can help give you that “just bought a new bag” feeling!"

      "content": "Say Damier like “dah-myay.” Once you've mastered the name of the label itself, try teaching yourself how to pronounce some of the tongue-twisting French names of its products. The first syllable in Damier is easy: “dahm” rhymes with “bomb.” Say -mier like “myay” with a slightly drawn out “ee” sound on the letter I. [3] X Research source Keep in mind that, in French, the -ier ending almost always has a silent R sound. The French word damier literally means “checkerboard,” just like the pattern on the famous LV Damier bags. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Pronounce Multicolor as “mooltee-colohr.”",
      "content": "Pronounce Multicolor as “mooltee-colohr.” To say this bag's name, use long vowel sounds for every vowel. The first syllable “mool” rhymes with “pool.” “Tee” is pronounced how it sounds. The third syllable “col” sounds like “coal” and the ending syllable sounds like “lore” (with a light, delicate R sound made by pressing the back of your tongue against the top of your mouth). [5] X Research source Don't forget that, in French, the letter I usually has an “ee” sound (not an “eye” sound). You wouldn’t say “mult-EYEcolor.” The Multicolor handbag collection features the Louis Vuitton monogram pattern in multicolor against a black or white background."

      "title": "Say Tahitiennes like “tah-ee-tee-enneh.”",
      "content": "Say Tahitiennes like “tah-ee-tee-enneh.” The tricky part of pronouncing Tahitiennes is ignoring the way it's spelled, which can cause problems for English speakers. Simply sound out the first three syllables: “tah,” “ee” (the H is silent), and “tee.” The ending -ennes is a little trickier and pronounced “enn-uh” (the S is silent). The final “uh” syllable should be delicate, but still audible. Note that the French H sound here is very light or silent. The word doesn't have an audible “hee” like the English “Tahitian.” The Tahitiennes bags feature a colorful LV monogram print on woven cotton canvas."

      "title": "Pronounce Popincourt like “pope-in-cohre.”",
      "content": "Pronounce Popincourt like “pope-in-cohre.” It’s tempting to pronounce this word like “Poppin Court,” but resist it! Instead, say “pope,” then “in,” then “cohre” (rhymes with “bore”). [6] X Research source Use the same light, delicate R sound as in Damier to end the word, rather than a hard English R sound. Don't pronounce the silent T at the end of the word. The last consonant is almost always silent in French except in very certain cases. To sound more French, make the “in” syllable sound almost like you’re saying a nasally “ehn.” The Popincourt bags are named after a market in Paris and resemble a tote bag you might carry your items in."

      "title": "Say Batignolles like “bat-een-yoleh.”",
      "content": "Say Batignolles like “bat-een-yoleh.” In French, the “gn” consonant pair makes a “nyuh” sound (like the N in “habañero”). With that in mind, pronounce Batignolles by sounding out the syllables “bat,” “een” (rhymes with “mean”), “yol” (rhymes with “role”), and “eh.” As with Tahitiennes , the final S is silent, but there is still a very light “eh” syllable. [7] X Research source The larger Batignolles bags are designed to be used as daily shoppers or briefcases."
