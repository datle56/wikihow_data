      "title": "Remove excess moisture near the painted area.",
      "content": "Remove excess moisture near the painted area. Since moisture can get underneath the paint and cause peeling, look for leaking or temperature fluctuations that cause sweating. For example, if you have peeling paint in the bathroom, the extreme temperatures and humidity can cause peeling. Consider using a dehumidifier in that room. [1] X Research source If the exterior paint is peeling, check around your gutters or roof to see if they're leaking onto the painted walls. If the walls near the kitchen or bathroom are peeling, you may need to see if the pipes are leaking."

      "title": "Identify areas of peeling paint.",
      "content": "Identify areas of peeling paint. Because several things can cause peeling paint, your peeling walls may show damage differently. Look for peeling, cracking, or flaking areas of paint. You might even see areas that have extreme cracking that looks like alligator skin. [2] X Research source These signs of damage can be caused by moisture getting under the paint or by painting on a surface that wasn't cleaned or primed well. Using cheap paint or painting second coats before letting the first coat dry can also cause damage."

      "title": "Protect your work space and yourself.",
      "content": "Protect your work space and yourself. Once you've located the peeled paint, lay down old towels, a tarp, or a sheet of plastic underneath the space. If the peeled paint is on the main part of a wall, apply painter's tape to the trim. To protect yourself from ingesting old paint, put on a safety mask, glasses, and gloves. [3] X Research source The old towel or tarp will catch the old paint and debris that you scrape off of the wall."
    },
    {
      "title": "Scrape off all of the peeling paint.",
      "content": "Scrape off all of the peeling paint. Choose a flat blade to scrape against the wall with the peeling paint. The old paint should come right off and fall onto your towel, plastic sheet, or tarp. You can use a stiff-blade putty knife, wire brush, or paint scraper. Scrape until you don't see any peeling paint on the wall. [4] X Research source Try scraping most of the paint away with something like a 5-in-1 tool, then sand away any remaining paint with sandpaper. [5] X Expert Source Patrick Coye Painting Specialist Expert Interview. 22 July 2020. Once you get to an area where the paint doesn't come off easily, you can stop scraping. [6] X Expert Source Patrick Coye Painting Specialist Expert Interview. 22 July 2020. Since removing peeling paint can expose toxic lead dust, pregnant women and children should avoid the area."

      "title": "Fill any cracks or holes.",
      "content": "Fill any cracks or holes. If you're repairing an interior surface, dip a putty knife into quick-setting patching compound. For an exterior surface, dip it into exterior spackling compound paste. Spread a thin layer over the damaged surface so any cracks or holes are filled. Check the manufacturer's instructions to see how long the material needs to dry. [7] X Research source If you apply the compound too thickly, the wall will feel bumpy."
    },
    {
      "title": "Sand the space.",
      "content": "Sand the space. After you make the repair, take a piece of fine-grit sandpaper and rub it over the space that you filled with compound. To repair a larger area, you can use a disc sander with a 60 to 120-grit disc. Sand the area until the surface feels smooth and blends in with the surrounding surface. [8] X Research source If you don't want to buy a disc sander, you might be able to rent one from a hardware store. Don't worry about getting the area too smoothâ€”you want there to be a little grit for the primer to adhere to. [9] X Expert Source Patrick Coye Painting Specialist Expert Interview. 22 July 2020."

      "title": "Wipe the area clean with a cloth.",
      "content": "Wipe the area clean with a cloth. Dip a sponge or cloth into water and wring it out so it's just damp. Wipe the space that you sanded to remove any dirt, dust, or old paint. Take a dry cloth and wipe it again so there's no moisture on the surface. The surface should be completely dry before you continue. [10] X Research source If you've repaired a large exterior surface, you may need to hose it down with water. You'll need to wait 2 to 3 days before preparing the surface for painting."

    {
      "title": "Apply a coat of primer.",
      "content": "Apply a coat of primer. Dip a brush or roller into a high-quality paint primer. Spread a thin, even layer of the primer over your repaired surface and let it dry completely. This can take several hours or up to a day depending on the brand of primer. If you're applying primer to an exterior space, you can use a spray applicator to cover it. [11] X Research source For a bathroom or kitchen, use an oil-based primer that can block stains. This type of primer will also protect humid surfaces from mildew."

      "content": "Touch up small surfaces with new paint . If you're just repainting a small repaired area, you can get out the can of paint that you originally used to paint the space or buy a sample-sized can of paint. Dip a bristle or sponge brush into the paint. Spread it directly over the primed surface and brush away towards the edges. [12] X Research source"

      "content": "Repaint large surfaces. If you repaired lots of peeling patches on a wall, you may need to repaint the whole wall . Pour your paint into a paint tray and coat a paint roller in it. Apply the paint in a light, even layer. Let it dry before you apply another coat of paint. [13] X Research source"

      "title": "Dry the space.",
      "content": "Dry the space. For interior walls, let the repaired areas dry for at least a day before you touch them or hang things up on them. If you repaired peeling paint in a bathroom, wait a full day before you take a shower or bath because this can introduce moisture. [14] X Research source Since you can't control how humid your outdoor surfaces get, just try to do your painting repairs when there are a few dry days forecasted."
