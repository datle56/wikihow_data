Once the pin has been removed you can remove the tie rod end. To do this, you will need a large, deep socket that fits over the inner tie rod end. There is also a tie rod removal tool that will make the job much easier that can you can use from any part store that does the loan a tool program. Twist the inner tie rod end counterclockwise until it is loose. Pull it off of the car. If you can gain access to the inner tie rod end, this can possibly be done with a wrench, if necessary.
