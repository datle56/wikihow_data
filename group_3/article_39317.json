      "content": "Pre-trim your pubic hair . Razors are designed to shave fairly short hair and will quickly clog and become dull if applied to long hair. To trim it, gently pull the hair up, away from your body and then cut it back with small, sharp scissors, preferably clippers, along with some equipped with safety guards. Alternatively, use an electric scissor-action trimmer without rotating heads . Aim for hair that is shorter than 1/4\" (0.6 cm). If you are new to pubic shaving, you may want to leave your hair short for a couple of days, as this will allow you to get used to the feeling of being bare down there. Trimming your hairs with scissors or small clippers is ok to do too, but some people become nervous when having such items near such a tender part of your body. If you aren't comfortable with using any of these, try electric razors . They are specifically designed to shave these kinds of hairs without getting too close to cut your skin. If you don't already own an electric razor, you can explore high-quality options here ."

      "content": "Soften your hair and hair follicles by taking a hot shower or bath. This will make the coarse pubic hair a lot easier to shave off. It may seem like a non-necessary step, but it'll make the somewhat lengthy process much more manageable. If you don't have time to take a hot shower or bath, simply run a washcloth under warm water and place it on your area and let it sit for about five minutes. It's important to exfoliate both before and after shaving because it will help all of the hairs get properly aligned outwards while stripping away the dead skin, allowing for a closer shave and reducing the chances of the razor catching and scratching you."

Moreover, men's shaving cream is often scented, which can lead to irritation and painful stinging. Need to purchase unscented shaving cream? You can find multiple options here ."

      "content": "Shave slowly and gently. To start off, is a great idea to shave slowly and with the grain. All this means is that if your hair grows downward, shave downward. This will help prevent irritation. Shaving against the grain is not a good idea when first starting off because doing so causes rashes and itchiness. [2] X Research source Another idea is to shave from side to side. This way, your skin will get more used to the feel of a razor on your private parts. Do not over-shave . Shave an area only as much as you need to remove the hair. If you go over it too many times, it will become inflamed. In the early stages of shaving, you will probably find that shaving your pubic hair two days in a row causes red bumps and/or itching. Skip several days between shaves until your skin grows used to the change."
