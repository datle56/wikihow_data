For a longer game, go with a limit of 1,000 points or more. [1] X Research source For example, if you decide on a limit of 1,000 points, you’ll have to play at least 5 rounds before a team wins. If you play until 500 points, you could finish the game in 3 rounds."

[2] X Research source If you have more than 4 people, make teams of more than 2 and rotate which players sit out each round. If you have less than 4 people, play a different card game like Pig or Blackjack ."

      "content": "Shuffle and deal out all the cards. Once the cards are shuffled, 1 person should deal out the cards to each player, 1 by 1, starting with the person to their left. The dealer should continue dealing out the cards until there’s only 1 card left. Place the last card face down in the middle of the table. [3] X Research source Remember that you need a special 57-card Rook deck in order to play. A Rook deck has more cards than a regular deck, and it contains a special Rook card. If you only have a regular card deck, play a different card game like Hearts instead."

      "title": "Assess the cards in your hand.",
      "content": "Assess the cards in your hand. Ask yourself how many points you think you can win with the cards you were dealt. The more high cards you have, the better chance you have of winning points later on. If you have all low cards, you probably won't win very many points. For example, if 10 out of your 14 cards are high cards (a 10 or higher), then you could assume you will probably win a lot of points this round. If all the cards in your hand are a 5 or lower, you don't stand the best chance of winning a lot of points."

Once the first player bids, the player to the left of them can pass or increase the bid by 5. The bid then goes to the next player, who can pass on the bid as it stands or increase it by 5. Bidding continues until all players have passed except for 1, or if the maximum bid limit of 200 is reached. The player with the highest bid wins. [4] X Research source If your team ends up winning less points than what you bid, you lose those points, so be careful not to bid too high unless you’re confident you have a lot of points in your hand. If all or most of your cards are the same suit, you should try to win the bid, even if your cards are low. If you win the bid, you can make the trump suit the same as the suit you have a lot of in your hand. Since the trump suit beats everything, you'll have a good chance of winning a lot of points."

The special Rook card (the card with the bird on it) is always the trump suit, regardless of the suit chosen by the bid winner. [5] X Research source For example, the winner of the bid could declare that yellow (1 of the 4 suits) is the trump suit. If you win the bid, choose a suit you have a lot of in your hand. Since the trump suit beats all other suits, you’ll have an advantage over the other team because you have a lot of that suit."

If the winner of the bid doesn’t like the card they picked up, they can swap it back. [6] X Research source If the face-down card you pick up is a high number or the same suit as the trump suit, you should probably keep it. If it's a low card that's not in the trump suit, you may want to put it back."

If they don’t have a card in the leading suit or trump suit, they can play any card in their hand. [9] X Research source For example, if the first player played a yellow 9, the second player would need to play a yellow card in their hand. If they didn’t have a yellow card, but they had a blue card and blue is the trump suit, they could play a blue card. If they didn’t have a yellow or blue card, they could play a card in one of the other suits."
