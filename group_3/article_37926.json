So those of you who believe and donate (give Sadaqah) will have a mighty reward.” [5] X Research source Other passages say what those who give Sadaqah will receive now and in the hereafter: “Whatever you believers spend in charity, it is for your own good—as long as you do so seeking the pleasure of Allah. Whatever you donate will be paid back to you in full, and you will not be wronged.” (Quran 2:272) [6] X Research source “Kind words and forgiveness are better than charity followed by injury. And Allah is Self-Sufficient, Most Forbearing.” (Quran 2:263) [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Zakat al Fitr is mandatory, while Sadaqah isn’t. Zakat, meaning “that which purifies,” is an obligatory annual payment and is one of the Five Pillars of Islam. Sadaqah has no fixed amount, can be performed at any time, and is an ongoing expression of generosity that includes many forms, not just monetary payments. [8] X Research source Only those who are eligible can pay or receive Zakat, while any Muslim can pay or receive Sadaqah. Zakat is 2.5% of your wealth, while a Muslim giving Sadaqah can pay as much or as little as they would like. Sadaqah Jariyah and Sadaqah have ongoing rewards after you die, but Zakat is only a charity you can give while you are alive."

Even the smallest gift can shade you on the Day of Judgement and protect you from Jahannam in the hereafter. [10] X Research source The Prophet Muhammed (ﷺ) also said “If anyone relieves a Muslim believer from one of the hardships of this worldly life, Allah will relieve him of one of the hardships of the Day of Resurrection” (Book 16, Hadith 29).
