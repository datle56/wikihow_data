Keep blotting until you’ve soaked up most of the urine–this will make the rest of the cleaning process a lot easier. [5] X Research source Make sure that you don’t rub the stain into the sofa. This can force the urine deeper into the leather, and will only make the cleaning process more difficult. It might help to open up a window or switch on a fan to help ventilate the area while you clean."
