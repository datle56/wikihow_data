      "title": "Set a goal.",
      "content": "Set a goal. Protests can function as a way to spread awareness about an issue or put pressure on those in power to make a specific change. What do you hope to accomplish with your protest? Figure out who the audience of your protest will be and plan your strategy from there. You're more likely to get the outcome you want if you take time to set a goal for achieving it. [1] X Research source For example, let's say you want to stage a protest at a local factory farm as a way to spread awareness about how animals are treated there so people will stop buying their products. In this case, your audience is the general public. You may have a more specific goal, like trying to prevent or change a discriminating law or policy. In this case, the aim of the protest might be to put pressure on the local government to address human rights and the needs of the community who feel discriminated against. In some cases, your goal might be quite large in scale, like if you're protesting a war or a governmental policy. In this case, the protest can be used as a tool to show political leaders that their constituents want a change in policy."

      "title": "Choose a location.",
      "content": "Choose a location. Find a location that is practical, symbolic, convenient, or all three. The location you choose should be the one that helps you reach your target audience so that the protest is as effective as possible. This could be the sidewalk in front of a business, a public street corner, the courthouse, the capitol building, or a park that has historically been used for protests in your city. Just remember that in order to be certain the protest is legal, the site you choose must be public. [2] X Research source There may be some private areas in which you can protest, but you have be aware you may be asked to leave. If you don't, this may count as trespass. If you are planning a counterprotest, you will not have the option of choosing where to protest. Keep in mind that having two opposing groups in the same space may cause safety issues. In the case of a counterprotest, you may wish to advise protesters not to arrive and leave alone. Try to focus on having your location somewhere relevant to the cause if you are hoping for more direct action, for example outside a government building or a relevant business. More practical areas with less relevance are better than nothing and can work well when you intend the protest to be quite large, or your main focus is on awareness building."

      "title": "Pick a time to stage the protest.",
      "content": "Pick a time to stage the protest. Protest at a time when you'll be able to gather the largest crowd and have the greatest impact on your audience. For example, if you're protesting a certain company's business practices, you'll want to stage the protest when the CEO is present, which will probably be during business hours. On the other hand, if the goal of your protest is to gather as many people as possible, you might want to protest on a weekend when more people will be available to come. [3] X Research source Be aware of other events happening in the area at that time. You can plan your protest near the time of the event if more footfall is expected, or you can take care not to have your protest clash with other events, at the risk of lower numbers at the protest. Check if there are any other protests going on in the city on the same day. If the causes are harmonious with each other, planning a protest at the same time may look like you are hostile to the other cause and take away from numbers at both. Having both protests back-to-back (and even liaising with the organisers of the other protest) can mean people become aware of one protest through the other, and there can even be an announcement of the second protest."

      "title": "Look into the necessary permits.",
      "content": "Look into the necessary permits. Check with your city officials about whether you need to get a permit to protest in the location you choose. Each city has its own laws regarding how many people can protest and where they can gather. Do your homework and get the permits you need if you worry your protest won't get disbanded before it can gain any traction. [4] X Research source Remember that protesting is a universal right. While local laws may restrict you, you still have the option of not seeking a permit, just be aware of any legal issues that may occur. In some cases, the permit will set limits on how many people can gather, how much noise you can make, and where protesters can move about. If you disagree with the terms, you can contact an attorney to help you try to get them altered. Some cities don't issue protest permits. Some people choose to alert the police anyway, but be careful as alerting the police can result in them putting restrictions in place in advance which they might not have done otherwise. Some people specifically choose not to request a permit for a protest, even if one is legally required, under the argument that the state should not be putting restrictions on the right to protest. The consequence of this can vary. Requesting a permit also makes it clear who the organiser is, which is generally not recommended for protests as they will be the main person held accountable for anything that happens at the protest, making them more vulnerable to arrest."

      "title": "Plan the sequence of events.",
      "content": "Plan the sequence of events. What actions will best help you achieve your goal? It's important to have an agenda in mind for what will happen once everyone is gathered for the protest. Do some research on other effective protests and come up with a game plan that will help you target your goal. Here are a few ideas: [5] X Trustworthy Source Kansas University Center for Community Health and Development Community-based research center focused on supporting public health development and education Go to source Have community leaders introduce the protest and make speeches on the issue at hand. Have an emcee who can lead protest chants and songs, and have bands play protest music. Plan a march from one location to another. This is a classic form of protesting that helps bring widespread attention to a cause. Implement performance art to help get your point across. [6] X Research source Screen an informative video or documentary on the subject you're protesting. Consider having a sit-in or sleep-in and occupy the space until your demands are met. Provide activities for children at the protest to get involved in that are relevant to the cause. Examples include arts and crafts, leading chants or taking part in a flash mob."

      "title": "Publicize the protest.",
      "content": "Publicize the protest. Take this important step to make sure your protest gets as much attention as possible. The aim isn't just to encourage people to show up for the protest, but to capture that attention of the media, too. Pull out all the stops to spread the word starting as early as you can. [7] X Research source Post details about the protest on all your social media channels. Make flyers about the protest and put them up around town. Target college campuses and other places where people likely to be interested in protesting your issue congregate. Call local newspapers and radio stations and ask them to publish information about the protest and promote it on the air. Get in touch with local activist groups to help your protest reach an audience of people likely to get involved. There may be instances where publicising a protest beforehand isn't the best route. In these sorts of cases, spread the word privately only to trusted people who are likely to actually turn up to the protest, but expect lower numbers."

      "title": "Gather protest materials.",
      "content": "Gather protest materials. Make posters, fliers, visual aids, or pamphlets to help spread your message and communicate your concerns to others. During the protest, you can give out information on why you're protesting to interested parties. You might want to put the name of the group with which you're affiliated on your protest materials, as well as the address of any social media or websites your group has. That way people who are new to the issue will know who to contact to find out more. Consider coming up with a catchy slogan for the materials—something people can easily memorize and communicate to others. Do not bring weapons to a protest (e.g. baseball bat, switchblade knives, batons, brass knuckles, stun guns, tactical pens or pepper spray). Keep in mind that toy weapons may be mistaken for real weapons."

      "title": "Wear protective clothing.",
      "content": "Wear protective clothing. You can keep yourself safe at a protest by dressing appropriately for the occasion. Dress for comfort—you might be standing or walking for several hours—and for safety, just in case you get jostled by the crowd or caught in the middle of an escalating conflict. Wear comfortable shoes. Wear several layers of thick clothing so you have extra padding on your body. If you plan to be on the front lines of a protest that could easily escalate into conflict, wear protective eyewear, since you might be sprayed with chemical agents such as pepper spray or tear gas. Consider if there is any political clothing you want to wear, such as a T-shirt with a slogan on it, or pin badges. There may also be symbolic colours associated with your cause. For example, UK republicans generally wear yellow to their protests, or if your protest is about supporting a specific country, you may wish to dress in the colours of their flag. In the age of surveillance, you may wish to bring a face mask or another face covering to hide your identity. These also help in preventing the spread of infectious diseases in large crowds."

      "title": "Bring emergency supplies.",
      "content": "Bring emergency supplies. Bring a backpack with a few supplies you might need. Bottled water and food are good to have on hand if the protest is going to last a long time. In addition to these staples, pack the following in your backpack: Copy of the protest permit, if applicable First aid kit Gas mask, escape hood, or respirator, if you have one and your country is known for using gas on protesters You may wish to bring items for others too, including strangers. This may include something like snacks, face masks, or earplugs."

      "title": "Understand that protests are unpredictable.",
      "content": "Understand that protests are unpredictable. No matter what you're protesting, there will be people who strongly disagree with your point of view. You may even encounter a separate group of protesters protesting the opposite side of the issue. At larger protests, the police may be present to try to control the crowd. With all these different forces butting heads, be prepared for unpredictable things to happen. Do research on the group you're protesting with. If you weren't one of the organizers, you should know the history of the group before joining the protest. If the group has ever used illegal tactics or caused violence at a protest, it's best to exercise caution in joining them. Most protests don't end in violence, but it does happen sometimes. When people feel passionate about an issue, their behavior can be unpredictable. Stay alert and aware of your surroundings when you protest. Be aware of your surroundings at all times and make sure people know where you are. have someone who is not going to the protest know where you are, as well as when you expect to be back. Let them know when you have left the protest so they know you are safe. Keep in mind that the police can also be unpredictable. Unfortunately there is the risk of the police making erroneous arrests/charges, as well as using excessive force. For this reason, it is recommended that you try to blend in with the crowd as much as possible."

      "title": "Follow the guidelines in the protest permit if you want to avoid arrest or any other trouble.",
      "content": "Follow the guidelines in the protest permit if you want to avoid arrest or any other trouble. Make sure you know your rights as a protester and are familiar with how to deal with police in case you get stopped by an officer. If you stick to the terms outlined in the protest permit, in theory, you shouldn't encounter problems, but you never know what could happen. [8] X Research source Many protesters have stewards, often in hi-viz vests. If you need help, speak to them. If you believe your free speech rights are being threatened, speak to the protest organizer or call an attorney. If a police officer asks if they can search you, you have the right to decline until a warrant is presented. If they do search you, they should tell you what they are looking for and why they believe you to have it. Many protesters have a group of people called legal observers. These people are there on the request of the protest organisers (and not the police) and are there to write down the actions of the police to ensure they are not misusing their power. They are volunteers who don't hold any officially-recognised powers, and most don't have any legal training, but they are usually there to give you advice on legal matters, such as what to do if a police approaches you, good lawyers to contact in the case of an arrest, and what your legal rights are. If you are organising a protest, see if you can get in contact with a group of legal observers to have a good number of them at your protest. While legal observers don't have to be impartial (they are there to support the rights of protesters, and likely agree with the cause), they are independent, meaning they cannot partake in the protest as a protester. Do not speak to a police officer more than you may be legally required to. You do not have to answer the police's questions, and can instead ignore them or say \"no comment\". There is no such thing as a 'friendly chat' with the police, and it is just a way for them to gather intelligence on you and the protest."

      "title": "Be mindful at all times.",
      "content": "Be mindful at all times. A protest can be a very effective way to exercise free speech, make your voice heard, and bring about change. However, being disrespectful to those against whom you're protesting can undermine your group's reputation and hurt the cause. You can criticise whatever or whoever you are protesting about while keeping the focus on the cause. Your arguments may be ignored if attention is drawn away from the cause. Avoid the following: Yelling personal insults at people who disagree with you Vandalizing public or private property (anything that is removable is generally fine; this includes stickers, chalk and some kinds of paint) Spitting or throwing water at people Resorting to violence of any kind"

      "title": "Know the law.",
      "content": "Know the law. Follow all the rules in your area if you want to avoid legal repercussions. If you're considering civil disobedience as part of your protest strategy, think carefully before taking action. Civil disobedience can be a courageous, nonviolent strategy for driving a point home, but it comes with serious consequences, like getting arrested. It's important to know what you're getting into before you choose to break the law in the name of your cause. [9] X Research source If arrest is expected, be as prepared as possible, and get good knowledge of what your rights are when you are arrested. You may also wish to find the name of a good lawyer beforehand."

      "title": "Gauge the effectiveness of your protest.",
      "content": "Gauge the effectiveness of your protest. When all is said and done, reflect back on the protest and decide what worked and what didn't. Think about whether you reached your goal, and whether a different approach would be more effective the next time around. No matter what, be proud that you stayed true to your beliefs and exercised your right to be heard. Even if your protest didn't bring about the change you want to see, speaking up about your cause is a step in the right direction. [10] X Research source It's unlikely that a single protest is going to change everything. You'll probably need to have follow-up protests. Consider approaching the issue from other angles as well. You could start a letter-writing campaign, lead a boycott, write a blog to voice your opinions, and take other actions to spread awareness and accomplish your goals. Don't give up! A protest gives you the opportunity to meet with like-minded people and form groups, which can make it easier to take your campaign further."
