    {
      "title": "Check the logo.",
      "content": "Check the logo. Ralph Lauren shirts often contain a small stitched on graphic of a polo player riding a horse. On a fake Ralph Lauren, the mallet the rider holds will be more circular than rectangular. The tail will be difficult to see and the horse's right back leg will be bent. On a genuine product, the horse's tail is clearly visible and the right back leg is straight. You should also be able to clearly see the outline of the rider's leg. On replicas, the leg often lacks definition. [1] X Research source As differences can be very subtle, it helps to look up an image of the actual logo for comparison. You may also want to use something like a magnifying glass to get a very close look at the Ralph Lauren logo on your product."

    {
      "title": "Examine the stitching.",
      "content": "Examine the stitching. Turn your t-shirt inside out and examine the stitching on the bottom. A genuine Ralph Lauren should have one thin line of even stitching running along the bottom of the shirt. No stitching, or jagged and uneven stitching, indicates your product is fake. [2] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Look at the collar label.",
      "content": "Look at the collar label. All Ralph Lauren products have labels under the collar indicating the size. The main collar label contains the Ralph Lauren logo and, to the right, a small tag is sticking out with the size written on it. If there is not a separate size label, the product is likely fake. The font should also be easily legible without misspellings. In addition to this, stitching along the collar should be the same color as the shirt. [3] X Research source High quality replicas can be extremely similar to authentic size labels, so look at a picture of a genuine size label online to compare it to your shirt's label. Even small changes in the font, including changes in spacing, can indicate a fake."
    },
    {
      "title": "Examine the buttons.",
      "content": "Examine the buttons. Buttons are secured with a neat pearl and cross stitch with thread that matches the color of the shirt. A different type of stitch, mismatched thread, or loose threads indicate a fake. [4] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Check the hem.",
      "content": "Check the hem. Lay your shirt down a flat surface. The back hemline should be slightly longer than the front hemline. Hemlines of equal length, or a front hemline that's longer than the back, indicate a fake product. [5] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Read the care label.",
      "content": "Read the care label. There should be a care label somewhere near the bottom of the shirt, which contains a trademark R and neat, evenly spaced copy. Illegible copy, or the absence of an \"R,\" usually mean the product is fake. [6] X Research source As with other aspects of fake products, differences can be very subtle. It can help to look up a picture of a genuine Ralph Lauren label online to compare and contrast."
    },
    {
      "title": "Check for sloppy stitching.",
      "content": "Check for sloppy stitching. Ralph Lauren is an expensive, high-end product. Stitching anywhere on the bag should be extremely neat and the same types of stitches should be used throughout the bag, including inside the pockets and on the underside of the bag. Inconsistent stitching and loose threads are signs of a fake product. [7] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Examine the material closely.",
      "content": "Examine the material closely. Fake purses will have a stiff feel, indicating they're made from cheaper materials than authentic products. Color may be inconsistent throughout the bag, appearing darker or lighter in certain areas. Also, designer purses do not have lining while fake purses do. [8] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Check for inaccuracies in the label.",
      "content": "Check for inaccuracies in the label. The label should be stitched in. Hang tags are an obvious sign of a fake product. Fake labels often have misspellings, illegible font, and have sloppy stitching with loose threads. [9] X Research source In higher quality counterfeit products, differences may be extremely subtle. Look up a photo of a genuine Ralph Lauren label online and compare and contrast this to your bag's label."
    },
    {
      "title": "Examine all the small details closely.",
      "content": "Examine all the small details closely. Sometimes, small details are the only way to spot a fake product. The handles of your bag should be the same length, the logo should not be crooked, and zippers and buttons should be firmly attached and work properly. [10] X Research source Designer products tend to be very high quality. It is unlikely that a designer bag would have any obvious flaws and imperfections."
