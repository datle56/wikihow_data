      "content": "Orbs are round balls of light that appear when you take a picture. Orbs often look like bright circular objects that are floating in the middle of the air. While they’re not normally visible to the naked eye, the orbs appear once they’ve been photographed. Even though it’s rare, people who have a strong psychic or spiritual connection claim to see orbs manifesting without having to use a camera."

      "title": "Orbs are said to be manifestations of ghosts or spirits.",
      "content": "Orbs are said to be manifestations of ghosts or spirits. Many people believe that spirits use a large amount of energy to become visible in the physical world again, which look like bright balls of light once they manifest. [1] X Research source Cartagenova adds that, “spirit orbs are…our loved ones, animals, or even guides coming to say hi.” Many people believe spirit orbs appear in haunted locations. Spirits of your loved ones may appear around important life events, like weddings, celebrations, or holiday gatherings."

      "title": "Dust, pollen, or bugs reflecting camera flash",
      "content": "Dust, pollen, or bugs reflecting camera flash Even though you may not see it with your naked eye, there’s usually small dust particles or pollen floating around in the air. When you use your camera flash, the light reflects off the particles that are close to the lens and make them look like orbs floating in the air. If you’re in a dusty or humid area, floating particles may be the rational explanation for seeing orbs. [2] X Research source Orbs or specks of light caused by dust and other floating debris are normally called “backscatter.” Raindrops or snow can also reflect off of a bright light and look like floating orbs. If you’re shooting pictures outdoors, then small insects may also pass in front of the lens and look like bright irregularly-shaped balls of light. Try turning off your camera flash or using bright lights for your photo to see if the orbs disappear."

      "title": "Dirty lens",
      "content": "Dirty lens When a small bit of dust or damage is on your camera lens, it prevents you from taking a clear image and may be visible in your final picture. Because it’s so close to the lens, even a small particle changes its appearance and looks like a round orb. [3] X Research source Try wiping off your lens with a lint-free cloth to remove any dust or debris on its surface and try taking your picture again to see if the orbs disappeared."

    {
      "title": "Lens flare",
      "content": "Lens flare Lens flares are caused by bright lights that shine directly into your camera’s lens, and they can look like bright orbs in your final image. If there’s a strong light source in front of your camera or a bright reflection in your picture, then they may be causing the orbs to appear. [4] X Research source Lens flares are really prominent on pictures you take with your phone because the camera lens is really close to the light when you use your flash. Try pointing your camera away from a light source and taking a picture. If the orbs disappear, then it was most likely just a lens flare."

      "title": "High ISO setting",
      "content": "High ISO setting The ISO setting on your camera determines how much light is let into the camera lens and affects the brightness of your picture. [5] X Research source If you have the ISO setting turned up on your camera when you take a picture, it brightens the image but also adds noise particles into the image, which could be confused as spirit orbs. Try turning down your ISO and decreasing your shutter speed or increasing your aperture setting."

      "title": "Paranormal orbs have irregular shapes.",
      "content": "Paranormal orbs have irregular shapes. Many orbs caused by lens flare or light reflection look perfectly round because they match the shape of your camera lens. When orbs look oblong or have a slightly different shape, then there’s a chance that spirits are actually manifesting. Keep in mind that small insects flying in front of your camera lens can also have slightly irregular shapes. Double-check the image for any visible legs, wings, or antennae to rule out insects causing the orb."

      "title": "Paranormal orbs appear when you don’t use flash.",
      "content": "Paranormal orbs appear when you don’t use flash. Dust, insects, and other floating debris all reflect light from your camera’s flash, so you can debunk most orbs that appear when you use it. However, if the orb appears without the flash or any bright lights nearby, then it could be the spirit energy appearing in your image."

      "content": "Paranormal orbs may trigger your intuitive senses. Because paranormal orbs use a lot of energy to manifest themselves, you can usually “feel” the energy shift in the area where they appear. If you sense that there’s some kind of energy radiating from an orb or your gut feeling tells you the orb is paranormal, trust your intuition! [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Paranormal orbs vary in color.",
      "content": "Paranormal orbs vary in color. Most orbs are just floating debris or other natural causes, they tend to only look solid white or solid gray. Orbs that are caused by spirits tend to look brighter and can be a variety of colors depending on the type of energy they’re manifesting and the message they’re trying to relay to the physical world."

If you know of any places that are haunted or have spirit activity, try to take pictures there as well. [17] X Research source Use your camera’s flash and auto-focus settings so the orbs become more visible in your shots. Pay attention to your surroundings and your intuition. If you notice lights flickering or have a gut feeling that there’s a presence nearby, then take out your camera and snap a few pictures. Plan to take a lot of pictures from different angles. Even if you don’t capture an orb in one picture, it may appear a few seconds later in the same spot."

Some people who are more sensitive to spirits and the paranormal claim that they have seen orbs appear in front of them without having to use a camera, but it’s definitely more rare. While bright lights can still make dust or particles in the air look like orbs, many people think the orbs are a large amount of spirit energy manifesting right before their eyes. [18] X Research source Others claim that pets or animals are sensitive to orbs, and they may get agitated when orbs appear in real life."

      "content": "How do you prevent orbs from appearing in photos? If you don’t want orbs or backscatter in your pictures, try to position your shot so there are not any bright lights or reflections in the frame. If you’re able to, turn off your flash or position the light above your camera lens so it’s less likely to cause reflections or lens flares. [19] X Research source Clean your camera lens with a lint-free cloth to remove any dust or smudges on the surface. If you can, be careful not to stir up any dust or debris into the air so they don’t reflect light. If you need to use the camera flash to get a good image, put a lens hood on your lens to block the light. Also, try increasing the aperture and decreasing your shutter speed."

      "title": "How do you remove orbs from photos?",
      "content": "How do you remove orbs from photos? Use photo editing software, like Photoshop or Lightroom, to get rid of orbs or backscatter in your pictures. Open the photo and choose the spot healing tool from the menu. Change the brush size to match the size of the orb and then click on the orb in your picture. The software will get rid of the orb and fill it in with the color of the background. [20] X Research source Some photo editors also have built-in dust and scratch removal tools that get rid of all the orbs at once rather than having to do them individually. If the orbs are large or cover multiple objects in your image, it may not be possible to fully remove them."
