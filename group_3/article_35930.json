      "content": "Do you feel like you’re walking on eggshells around her? When you’re with a manipulative partner for a while, you tend to feel uneasy about almost every interaction you have. This is because in the back of your mind, you probably know that something is not quite right.

      "title": "Does she make you question your memories or thoughts?",
      "content": "Does she make you question your memories or thoughts? This might look like you bringing up a past conversation, but your girlfriend denies it ever happened. Or, you might talk about how you’re feeling, but your girlfriend says that you’re overreacting or being irrational. She might say things like, “Are you sure that happened? I think you’re misremembering,” or, “You’re so emotional. You always over-exaggerate things.” Gaslighting is a form of psychological abuse. If you are being gaslit by your girlfriend, reach out to friends or family for help right away. Reader Poll: We asked 379 wikiHow readers to tell us the most important sign that a relationship has long term potential, and 55% said handling conflict in a healthy way . [Take Poll] So if your girlfriend is unable or unwilling to handle conflict without manipulation, then that's a sign that this relationship isn't built for the long term."

      "title": "What happens when you try to bring up a problem in your relationship?",
      "content": "What happens when you try to bring up a problem in your relationship? Healthy partners will talk together about the problem and work with each other to find a solution. However, if your girlfriend is manipulative, she’ll probably try to spin things like they’re your fault, even when they’re clearly her own. For instance, maybe you try to bring up the fact that she’s on her phone a lot when you two are supposed to be hanging out. Instead of working with you to find a compromise, she might say something like, “Well, you’re on your phone too sometimes, even when I ask you to stop. You’re making this a huge deal.”"

      "title": "Does your girlfriend knowingly push your buttons?",
      "content": "Does your girlfriend knowingly push your buttons? Healthy partners will always respect each other’s boundaries. If your girlfriend is manipulating you, she might start pushing your boundaries slowly at first to see how far she can go. Over time, she’ll push them more and more until she crosses them completely. [2] X Research source Maybe you set a boundary that you need 2 hours of alone time after work. Your girlfriend might start by giving you an hour and a half to yourself, then just an hour, then 30 minutes. Eventually, you’ll realize that you aren’t getting any alone time at all, even though you made it clear in the beginning that you needed it."

      "title": "When you two hang out, are you only doing things she likes to do?",
      "content": "When you two hang out, are you only doing things she likes to do? You might only be hanging out with her friends, too. In healthy relationships, partners will take an interest in each other’s interests and meet each other halfway. However, if your girlfriend shows no signs of wanting to do activities that you enjoy, that’s a red flag. [3] X Research source Partners can have different hobbies, and that’s totally fine. However, if you make time to do your girlfriend’s favorite things and she won’t do the same for you, she could be manipulating you."

      "title": "Does she only want you to hang out with her?",
      "content": "Does she only want you to hang out with her? In toxic relationships, your partner won’t let you see your friends or family members because they’re a “bad influence” on you. In reality, your girlfriend might be keeping you away from them because they will warn you about her red flags. If your girlfriend is trying to limit your contact with the outside world, you may be in an abusive relationship. [4] X Research source Your girlfriend might also try to guilt you into hanging out with her, saying things like, “You never hang out with me!” or, “Why do you spend so much time with them?”"

      "title": "Does she “test” you to make sure you actually love her?",
      "content": "Does she “test” you to make sure you actually love her? In healthy relationships, partners know they love each other no matter what. If your girlfriend ever asks you to do something to “prove” that you love her, she’s manipulating you. You don’t need to be tested or prove yourself for anyone, especially not your partner. [5] X Research source She might ask you to buy her gifts, have sex with her (when you don’t really want to), unfollow certain people on social media, or stop hanging out with certain friends."

      "title": "When she does you a favor, does she bring it up a lot?",
      "content": "When she does you a favor, does she bring it up a lot? Healthy partners will do things for each other out of love, not because they can hold it over your head. If your girlfriend makes you feel guilty for asking for help, it could mean she’s manipulating you. [6] X Research source She might say things like, “You can’t be mad at me, I bought you food yesterday,” or, “I can do whatever I want, because I paid for our vacation.”"

      "title": "Does she express her anger with sarcasm?",
      "content": "Does she express her anger with sarcasm? Instead of talking with you about why she’s upset, your girlfriend might get moody or short with you. If you ask her what’s wrong, she might say, “I’m fine,” or, “Nothing.” Not talking about your problems in a relationship isn’t healthy, and it may be a manipulation tactic to get you to feel bad.

      "title": "Do you feel like you can live your life how you want to?",
      "content": "Do you feel like you can live your life how you want to? If your girlfriend is manipulative, she might try to control small aspects of your life. She could tell you what to wear, how to do your hair, what to eat, how to talk, or even what to spend money on. Healthy partners don’t try to control or change each other—they accept each other as they are. [8] X Research source She might also ask you who you’re talking to on the phone, or try to check your texts."

      "title": "Do you feel like you can’t do anything right?",
      "content": "Do you feel like you can’t do anything right? Your girlfriend may be trying to lower your self-esteem. When you talk to your girlfriend, do you feel happy and good about yourself? Or do you often feel upset and belittled? In healthy relationships, partners want to lift each other up, not tear each other down. [9] X Research source Constructive comments are okay, but calling your partner names or disrespecting them is not."

      "title": "Is she secretive about her phone or computer?",
      "content": "Is she secretive about her phone or computer? This probably means that she’s doing things she knows you wouldn’t like. She might get jumpy or nervous when you ask to see her phone, or berate you for borrowing her computer. She could be chatting with people online or posting things about you behind your back. [10] X Research source Unfortunately, being nervous about her devices could also mean that she’s cheating on you."

      "content": "Does she make you share your passwords with her? In healthy relationships, both partners are allowed to have their privacy.
