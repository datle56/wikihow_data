      "content": "Yes, rolled and old fashioned oats are the same type of oat. The terms are used interchangeably and they reference the same style of oat. There are 5 different kinds of oats, though, and how long they’re processed is what makes them unique (and why they have with different names). [1] X Research source The 5 different types of oats (from least to most processed) are: Steel-cut oats Scottish oats Rolled or old-fashioned oats Quick oats Instant oats Once harvested, oat seeds are washed and deshelled to form oat groats. Oat groats are then heated in a kiln and divided into separate processors. The longer the oat groat is rolled and squashed, the faster it’ll cook and easier it’ll be to digest. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Rolled or Old-Fashioned Oats",
      "content": "Rolled or Old-Fashioned Oats These two oats are one and the same. Some brands call them rolled oats, while others call them old-fashioned. Either way, they’re the same size oat and are flat and flakey. They take around 5 minutes to cook in the microwave or stovetop and have a firm texture. [3] X Research source Rolled or old fashioned oats are typically used to make granola bars, muffins, and breads."

      "title": "Steel-Cut Oats",
      "content": "Steel-Cut Oats Also known as Irish oats, these are the hardest and least processed type of oat on the market. Because of their hefty nature, they take around 30 minutes to cook on the stove and look like small kernels before they soften. These chewy oats work well in a crock pot or instant pot dishes because of their hardiness."

      "title": "Stone Ground Oats",
      "content": "Stone Ground Oats Sometimes called Scottish oats, these are a hard, fragmented version of oats that makes a creamy porridge. The broken oat pieces vary in size and generally take around 30 minutes to cook on the stovetop and have a grits-like consistency. [4] X Research source These oats can be made overnight in an instant pot or added to bread and cookie dough."

    {
      "title": "Quick Cook Oats",
      "content": "Quick Cook Oats These oats are essentially rolled or old-fashioned oats chopped into fine pieces. They’re about half the size of a rolled oat but have the same flat and flaky appearance. Quick oats cook quickly (go figure) at around 1 minute on the stovetop or in the microwave. [5] X Research source Make quick oatmeal for breakfast with these oats or toss them into a muffin batter for added texture."

      "title": "Instant Oats",
      "content": "Instant Oats If you use oatmeal packets, you’re eating instant oats! These oats are the most finely chopped and only need some hot water to prepare. They have a soft texture and typically come already flavored. Jazz up your instant oats by topping your oatmeal with berries, yogurt, peanut butter, or granola."

      "title": "Oats can be used interchangeably, but they may change a food’s texture.",
      "content": "Oats can be used interchangeably, but they may change a food’s texture. Most recipes call for rolled or old-fashioned oats because they have a firmer texture when baked. Quick oats can be used as a substitute for rolled oats, but they may make the baked good chewier. Meanwhile, steel-cut and stone ground oats can be used interchangeably when baking breads, but aren’t a good replacement for rolled or quick oats. If a recipe calls for quick oats, but you only have rolled (or old-fashioned) oats, pop your rolled oats in the blender for a few seconds. Remember, quick oats are essentially rolled oats chopped in half. Instant oats can be used in a pinch if you’re out of quick oats, but they may cook faster and give baked goods a softer texture."

      "title": "The less processed oats are, the healthier they are.",
      "content": "The less processed oats are, the healthier they are. Generally, all oats are healthy. They’re full of soluble fiber, vitamins, and minerals, making them a nutritious breakfast or snack that’s heart-healthy and diabetic-friendly. However, pre-prepared packets of instant oats tend to have added sugars and sweeteners that can take away some of the health factors. [6] X Research source Stock your pantry with plain, unseasoned oats (of your preferred type) so you can control the additives. For instance, if you like brown sugar instant oat packets, make your own version with quick oats and a dash of brown sugar (rather than the 12 g of sugar in a typical packet). Fruits are a naturally great way to flavor plain oats. Try slicing a banana or some strawberries into your bowl. Substitute white or brown sugar with honey or 100% maple syrup for a less processed alternative. [7] X Research source"
