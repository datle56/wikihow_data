      "content": "Hose down the area to rinse off dirt from the surface. Take your hose and aim a concentrated jet directly onto the scratches. Spray the area well so it’s nice and wet and the water is able to blast out any small particles of dust and dirt that may be lodged in the tiny scratches so they don’t get further embedded when you polish the surface. [1] X Research source Don’t worry, spraying the fine scratches won’t make them worse or damage your paint."

      "title": "Scrub the scratched area using soapy water and a sponge.",
      "content": "Scrub the scratched area using soapy water and a sponge. Fill a medium-sized bucket about halfway full of water, add a few drops of automotive soap into 1 of your buckets, and mix it well so it’s nice and soapy. Take a clean sponge, soak it in the bucket of soapy water, and squeeze out the excess water. Gently scrub the scratched surface using circular motions to remove any dirt or residue from the paint and in the scratches. [2] X Research source Automotive soap, or car soap, is specially formulated to clean the clear coat that protects your paint, making it the best choice for you to use to prepare the surface for you to remove the fine scratches. Dip the sponge back into the soapy water and wring it out well whenever you need to apply more. Avoid scrubbing vigorously over the scratches. Just gently rub the surface to clean it."

      "content": "Dry the area with a clean cloth. The scratched area needs to be completely dry before you apply any polish, so take a clean, dry cloth and gently wipe the area to remove any water from the surface. Continue wiping until it’s fully dry to the touch. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Choose a rubbing compound and polish designed for cars. Rubbing compound is used to repair damage to paint by filling fine scratches to replace the topcoat on your car’s paint. Car polish also helps to eliminate fine scratches and swirls, as well as restoring the shine of your car’s paint. Use both of them to safely and gently remove fine scratches from the paint on your car. [5] X Research source Look for rubbing compound and car polish at your local auto supply shop or by ordering them online."

Add a small amount of the rubbing compound to the center of the pad. Fold it onto itself a few times and then open it back up to spread the compound evenly over the surface of the pad. [6] X Research source A small amount of compound goes a long way, even for large areas of fine scratches."

Use up-and-down motions to spread the compound deep into the small scratches. Move the pad along the entire scratched area to fill them with the compound.
