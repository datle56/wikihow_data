[2] X Trustworthy Source HelpGuide Nonprofit organization dedicated to providing free, evidence-based mental health and wellness resources. Go to source A tranquil environment will enable you to focus exclusively on the task at hand and avoid external stimuli and distractions. Find a place where you will not be interrupted for the duration of your meditation—whether it lasts 5 minutes or half an hour. The space does not need to be very large—a walk-in closet or even an outdoor bench can be used for meditation as long as you have privacy. For those new to meditation, it's especially important to avoid any external distractions. Turn off TV sets, phones, or other noisy appliances. [3] X Research source If you play music, choose calm, repetitive tunes to avoid breaking your concentration. You can also play white noise or quiet nature sounds, like running water. Your meditation space does not need to be completely silent, so you won’t need earplugs. The sound of a lawnmower or dog barking shouldn't prevent effective meditation. In fact, being aware of these noises without letting them dominate your thoughts is an important component of meditation. Meditating outside works for many so long as you don't sit near a busy roadway or another source of loud noise. You can find peace under a tree or sitting on some lush grass in a favorite corner of a garden."

Wear a sweater or cardigan if you plan on meditating someplace cool, or bring a blanket or shawl you can wrap around yourself. You don’t want the sensation of feeling cold to consume your thoughts. If you are in a place where you can't easily change your clothes, do your best to make yourself as comfortable as possible. Try just taking off your shoes."

      "content": "Do some stretches before you start to prevent stiffness. Meditation usually involves sitting in one spot for a certain period of time, so it is important to release any tension or tightness before you begin. A couple of minutes of light stretching can help prepare both your body and mind for meditation. It will also prevent you from focusing on any sore spots instead of relaxing. [6] X Trustworthy Source American Heart Association Leading nonprofit that funds medical research and public education Go to source Remember to stretch your neck , shoulders, and lower back—especially if you've been sitting in front of a computer. Stretching out your legs —with an emphasis on the inner thigh—can be helpful when meditating in the lotus position . If you don’t already know how to stretch, consider learning different stretching techniques to try before you meditate. Many meditation experts recommend doing light yoga stretches before meditation."

      "content": "Sit in a comfortable position. It is very important that you are comfortable while you meditate, so finding the best position for you is the goal. [7] X Research source Traditionally, meditation is practiced by sitting on a cushion on the ground in either a lotus position or half-lotus position, but this position can be uncomfortable if you lack flexibility in your legs, hips, and lower back. You want to find a posture that allows you to sit with a balanced, tall, and straight posture. You can sit—with or without crossing your legs—on a cushion, chair, or meditation bench. Once seated, your pelvis should be tilted forward enough to center your spine over your “sit bones,” the 2 bones in your behind that bear your weight when seated. To tilt your pelvis into the right position, sit on the forward edge of a thick cushion or place something about 3 or 4 inches (7.6 or 10.2 cm) thick under the back legs of a chair. You can also a use a meditation bench, which is usually built with a tilted seat. If you’re using a bench that’s not tilted, put something under it, so it tilts forward between .5 to 1 inch (1.3 to 2.5 cm)."

[9] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Once you’re in a comfortable position, focus on the rest of your back. Start from your bottom and think about each vertebra in your spine as balancing one on top of another to support the whole weight of your torso, neck, and head. It requires practice to find the position that allows you to relax your torso with only slight effort being used to maintain your balance. Whenever you feel tension, relax the area. If you can't relax it without slumping, check the alignment of your posture and seek to rebalance your torso, so those areas can relax. The most important thing is that you are comfortable, relaxed, and have a balanced torso, so your spine can support all of your weight from the waist up. The traditional hand placement involves resting your hands in your lap, palms facing upward, with your right hand on top of your left. However, you can also rest your hands on your knees or leave them hanging down by your side."

[10] X Research source As a beginner, it is often best to try meditating with closed eyes in order to avoid visual distractions. Once you have grown accustomed to meditation, you can try practicing with your eyes open. This tends to help if you find yourself falling asleep when meditating with your eyes closed or if you experience disturbing mental images, which happens to a small number of people. If you keep your eyes open, you will need to keep them \"soft\" by not focusing on any one thing in particular. [11] X Research source You don't want to go into a trance-like state.

Mantra meditation is another common form of meditation that involves repeating a mantra (a sound, word, or phrase) over and over until you silence the mind and enter a deep, meditative state. The mantra can be anything you choose, so long as it’s easy to remember. [14] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Some good mantras to start with include words like “one,” “peace,” “calm,” “tranquil,” and “silence.” If you want to use more traditional mantras, you can use the word \"Om,\" which symbolizes omnipresent consciousness. Or you can use the phrase \"Sat, Chit, Ananda,\" which means \"Existence, Consciousness, Bliss.\" Silently repeat the mantra over and over to yourself as you meditate, allowing the word or phrase to whisper through your mind. Don't worry if your mind wanders off. Just refocus your attention and refocus on the repetition of the word.

In a similar way to using a mantra, you can use a simple visual object to focus your mind and allow you to reach a level of deeper consciousness. This is a form of open-eye meditation, which many meditators find helpful. [16] X Research source The visual object can be anything you wish. The flame of a lit candle can be particularly pleasant. Other possible objects to consider include crystals, flowers, or pictures of divine beings, such as the Buddha. Place the object at eye level, so you don't need to strain your head and neck to view it. Gaze at it until your peripheral vision starts to dim and the object consumes your vision. Once you are focused entirely on the object, you should feel a sense of profound serenity.

One common type of visualization involves creating a peaceful place in your mind and exploring it until you reach a state of complete calm. [18] X Research source The place can be anywhere you like; however, it should not be entirely real. You want to imagine a unique place that’s personalized for you. The place you visualize could be a warm, sandy beach, a flower-filled meadow, a quiet forest, or a comfortable sitting room with a roaring fire. Whatever place you choose, allow it to become your sanctuary. Once you have mentally entered your sanctuary, allow yourself to explore it. Don’t work to \"create\" your surroundings. It’s as if they are already there. Just relax and allow the details to come to the forefront of your mind. Take in the sights, sounds, and scents of your surroundings. Feel the fresh breeze against your face or the heat of the flames warming your body. Enjoy the space for as long as you wish, allowing it to naturally expand and become more tangible. When you are ready to leave, take a few deep breaths, then open your eyes. You can come back to this same place the next time you practice visualization, or you can simply create a new space."

To begin, sit or lie down in a comfortable position. Close your eyes and begin to focus on your breathing, then gradually move your attention from one part of your body to another. Notice the sensations you feel as you go. [19] X Research source You may find it helpful to start at the bottom and work your way up. For example, concentrate on whatever sensations you can feel in your toes. Make a conscious effort to relax any contracted muscles and release any tension or tightness in your toes. When your toes are fully relaxed, move upwards to your feet and repeat the relaxation process. Continue along your body, moving from your feet to the top of your head. Spend as much time as you like focusing on each part of your body. Once you have completed the relaxation of each individual body part, focus on your body as a whole and enjoy the sensation of calmness and looseness you have achieved. Focus on your breathing for several minutes before coming out of your meditation practice. With regular practice, this technique can make you more aware of the various sensations in your body and help you deal with them appropriately.

Walking meditation is an alternate form of meditation that involves observing the movement of the feet and becoming aware of your body's connection to the earth. [25] X Research source If you plan on performing long, seated meditation sessions, try breaking them up with some walking meditation. Choose a quiet location to practice your walking meditation with as few distractions as possible. Remove your shoes if it’s safe to do so. Hold your head up with your gaze directed straight ahead and your hands clasped together in front of you. Take a slow, deliberate step with your right foot. After taking the first step, stop for a moment before taking the next. Only 1 foot should be moving at any given time. When you reach the end of your walking path, stop completely with your feet together. Then pivot on your right foot and turn around. Continue walking in the opposite direction using the same slow, deliberate movements as before. While practicing walking meditation, try to focus on the movement of the feet and nothing else. This intense focus is similar to the way that you focus on the rising and falling of your breath during breathing meditation. Try to clear your mind and become aware of the connection between your foot and the earth below it."
