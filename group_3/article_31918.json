      "content": "Pull the sausages out of the fridge 20 minutes before cooking and cut them at the link if they’re still attached. About 20 minutes before you plan to put them in the oven, take the sausages out of the fridge and set them on the counter. This will take the chill off of them so that they cook more evenly. If the sausages are still linked together, they won't be spaced apart properly and won't cook as evenly as they should. Use scissors to cut them all apart at the links."

      "content": "Line a baking pan with a piece of foil and place a wire rack on top of the pan to cut down on grease. Cut a piece of aluminum foil that’s a little longer than the baking pan you want to use. Wrap the ends of the foil over the edges of the pan so that it’s loosely gripping the pan. Adding foil will make for easier cleanup and will ensure the sausages don't stick to the pan. [1] X Research source If you want your sausages to be less greasy, put a wire rack on top of the pan. It should be a rack that fits securely inside the pan and won’t slide around when you’re handling the pan. Using a rack will allow the excess grease to drip away from the sausages rather than let the meat cook in the grease."

      "content": "Cook the sausages in the oven for 20 minutes. Place the sausages in the oven on the middle rack. Cook them for about 20 minutes if they are of average size. [2] X Research source Make sure you roast raw sausages whole. You can, however, cut up smoked sausage before putting it in your oven to shorten your cook time."

Hold the sausage still with a fork and cut into it about halfway down with a sharp knife. Cut only deep enough to see the color in the middle of the sausage."

      "content": "Use a meat thermometer if you’re concerned about meat safety. If you want to be sure the sausages are safe to eat, use a meat thermometer to check the internal temperature. Push the thermometer into the center of one of the sausages and check to see if the temperature rises to 160 °F (71 °C) or higher. [4] X Research source If the temperature is too low, add five to ten minutes of cook time until the sausages reach 160 °F (71 °C)."
