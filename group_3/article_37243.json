Before wiping your Roomba clean by doing a factory reset, try rebooting it to see if that helps. If you want to clear the scheduled cleaning times or reset the clock on your Roomba, do a reboot."

      "content": "Do a factory reset if a reboot doesn't resolve the issue. If your Roomba is blinking and displaying an error code, resetting the machine can reboot the software and fix the problem. If you're selling your Roomba, wipe all the data first by resetting the machine. This is especially important if you use the iRobot Home app since the new owner might want to connect to the app and they won't be able to unless you clear your information."

If you have a 600 series Roomba that has a green dot on the underside of the bin, remove the battery and leave it out for 30 seconds. Then, reinstall it—this signals the reboot is complete."
