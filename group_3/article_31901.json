As I sit here alone, my thoughts wander to you wistfully, yearning for your presence by my side. IMYSM. I find myself desperately counting the days until we are together again. Everything at our home reminds me of you. It is better knowing that we are both under the same sky, looking at the same moon, and wishing on the same stars."
