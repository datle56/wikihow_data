      "content": "A little mental prep helps you stay cool and collected during negotiations. Assume that your employer will ask you a lot of on-the-spot questions, like “What other job offers do you have at the moment?” or “Are you planning on accepting our offer?” Come up with a neutral and honest response ahead of time so you don’t feel tripped up during the conversation. [4] X Research source Example question: “What other job offers do you have at the moment?” Example answer: “I’ve been in contact with a few other companies, but I haven’t made any final decisions yet.” Example question: “Are you planning on accepting our offer?” Example answer: “I plan on giving your offer the time and consideration that I think it deserves.” In some cases, you can negotiate your salary over email . In this case, you don’t have to worry as much about preparing for difficult questions beforehand. Wondering how to answer questions about expected salary?

      "content": "Decide what salary you’re willing to settle for ahead of time. Stick to that baseline salary throughout the negotiation. If the employer refuses to meet it, thank them for their time and explain that you won’t be able to accept the position. [7] X Research source For instance, your baseline might be a 5% increase of your current salary. If the employer refuses to pay more than your current salary, you’d walk away from the negotiation. You could say “Thanks so much for taking the time to meet with me today. I really appreciate your offer, but it isn’t a good fit for me at this time.” Be prepared to potentially walk away when negotiating a raise, too. Talking with your boss will help you understand what your employer values most, and if you’re a big priority to them. Walking away may be the best option if your current employer doesn’t treat you with the respect and importance you deserve.

What are they most concerned about, and what are their biggest priorities? Knowing and understanding the employer’s goals can help you make a persuasive case during your salary negotiation. Let’s say that you’re negotiating a raise for your hourly wage. One of your manager’s biggest stressors is not having enough staff to consistently cover more difficult shifts. In your negotiations, you could address this point by offering to take on some of these shifts in exchange for a higher wage. If the employer really values teamwork and cooperation, you could showcase different examples of all the times you were a team player."

      "content": "People who go second in negotiations often have the upper hand. If your employer asks for your desired salary, flip the question around so they have to answer it. Asking a question like “What is your salary range for this position?” forces the employer to mention an exact amount of money first. [10] X Trustworthy Source American Psychological Association Leading scientific and professional organization of licensed psychologists Go to source Don’t be discouraged if the salary range is a bit lower than what you’re expecting. Employers tend to stick with lower numbers at the beginning of negotiations. The same logic applies if an employer asks you about your current salary. Instead of answering directly, ask “What have you budgeted for this job position?” [11] X Research source"

[12] X Research source Use your resume and cover sheet to your advantage, too! Point out some of the proudest, most impressive achievements that you have listed there.

Salary negotiations are all about building a solid, trustworthy connection with your employer, so it’s important to meet the other party halfway. [14] X Research source What not to say: “I led a huge team of employees that created ground-breaking improvements at my past workplace.” What to say: “I was part of a small task force that helped improve efficiency around the office.” Don’t lie or fudge the details about things that are really easy to cross-reference, like your current salary. It can feel good to give yourself an extra boost at the moment, but that lie won’t do anything for your long-term credibility."

Feel free to ask about the job offer itself, the job description of the position you’re being offered, or anything else that you’re curious about. It’s the employer’s duty to make sure that you understand every aspect of the offer that’s on the table—plus, asking intelligent questions helps showcase your negotiation chops. You might ask: “What’s the estimated start date for this position?” “Does this position have a sign-on bonus?” “Would you mind telling me more about the benefits for this position? When would they be starting?” “Is this a negotiable offer?” [15] X Research source"

      "content": "Quiet, reflective moments help you and the employer reach a better agreement. Researchers have found that moments of silence give both the employer and the employee more time to reflectively think about the negotiation at hand. This shift to a more productive mindset helps you get the most out of the negotiation and reach a better bottom line. [16] X Research source We’re not talking about a long, awkward silence here—just a few seconds is enough to do the trick."

Factors like paid time off, retirement perks, health insurance, remote work options, and other benefits could all be on the table. Think about which of these perks are most valuable to you, and add them into your final counter-offer. [17] X Research source If flexibility is a big priority for you, you might negotiate a remote work-from-home plan, along with four-day work weeks. If benefits are your biggest priority, you could focus more on your paid time off and insurance benefits. A good benefits package can potentially make up for an underwhelming salary offer."

      "title": "The employer won’t be pleased if you keep making new requests.",
      "content": "The employer won’t be pleased if you keep making new requests. Put yourself in the employer’s shoes for a second. How would you feel if a prospective (or current) employee kept adding on request after request to a job offer? It would probably make you feel annoyed, disrespected, and less likely to take that candidate seriously. With that logic in mind, mention everything that you’d like at one time, so the employer knows exactly where you stand. [18] X Research source For example, mention that you’d like more paid time off, a larger bonus, and a longer parental leave period all at once rather than asking for each perk individually. Think back to all the salary research you did before the negotiation. What was the average salary range for your job position? Pick a high number from this range—just make sure that it’s within reason. Even if your employer negotiates down, you’ll still end up with a higher salary than you might have gotten originally."

Employers may promise specific benefits and perks during your negotiation, only to completely forget about them later on. A written offer gets everything out in the open, so there’s no doubt about what you and your employer agreed upon. [19] X Research source “Is there any way to get this offer in writing?

Let them know how thankful you are for the opportunity, and explain that you want to give their offer a lot of thought and meditation before committing to anything. [20] X Research source “Thank you so much for your consideration and interest in me as a candidate. Would it be okay if I took a week to look over everything and weigh my options?” “I’m so grateful for the opportunity you’ve offered me here. Is it okay if I take a few days to think things over before committing to anything?”"
