Take care to remove anything that touches your skin so that there is no barrier between you and the water. Wipe off any nail polish and remove any makeup so that the water can hit your nails and face. Remove all of your clothing and jewelry and step into the shower. [1] X Research source It’s preferable to use clean, running water for ghusl . If you don’t live in an area where clean water is available, you may use other water."

Every act of worship in Islam starts with the setting of an intention, or a “niyyah.” Your intention is meant to remind you that this ritual is being done in order to serve Allah. Make it clear in your heart and mind that your intention is to strengthen your connection to Allah. There’s no need to speak out loud—you can think something like: “Allow this ghusl to make me pure” or “I am performing ghusl to become pure.” [2] X Research source Then, say Bismallah (“in the name of Allah”) in order to officially begin the ritual."

Make sure to use only your hands to clean your vulva, and avoid any scented soaps, douches, or harsh scrubbing. As you wash, be sure to only clean from the front of the vulva toward the back (rather than the opposite direction) in order to avoid irritation and bacterial spread.

Then, wash the following body parts to complete the ablution ritual: [5] X Research source Mouth & Nose: Use your right hand to scoop water into your mouth. Gargle and swirl the water in your mouth three times. Then, use your right hand to sniff water into your nose, then blow it out into your left hand. Repeat this nose-cleaning three times.

      "content": "In Islam, ghusl is a full-body ritual bath meant to cleanse a person of impurities. Also known as a “full ablution,” ghusl is a part of the Islamic faith that’s required in order to purify and ready a person for worship or prayer. Ghusl is considered especially important for Muslim women, who use the practice to honor their modesty, renew themselves spiritually, and clarify their minds and bodies before acts of worship. It’s generally required after menstruation, childbirth, and sexual intercourse. [14] X Research source The practice of ghusl comes from Islamic holy texts like the Quran and the Sunnah . In these texts, Allah (the Muslim God) forbids followers from performing acts of worship like prayer or fasting when in a state of impurity, which is why ghusl is necessary. Purity is an important concept in Islam that’s thought to shape a Muslim’s spiritual and physical wellbeing. But how is ghusl* different from wudu ?** Both wudu and ghusl are acts of purification and cleansing. Wudu is a partial cleansing, however, while ghusl is a full cleansing. Ghusl washes the whole body and is only done in specific situations, while wudu is performed before every prayer and focuses on specific body parts. [15] X Research source"

After one of these events, they must perform ghusl in order to cleanse their mind, body, and spirit before engaging in worship or prayer. Most commonly, anyone who menstruates must perform ghusl after the end of their cycle and people of all genders must perform ghusl after intercourse. Ghusl must also be performed once the bleeding after childbirth ceases, as well as after nocturnal emissions (or wet dreams). [16] X Research source G husl after a wet dream is only required if there’s visible fluid released outside the body. However, it’s important to note that most people with vulvas emit discharge regularly, so fluid is not always indicative of a nocturnal emission. [17] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source Other recommended (but not obligatory) times to perform ghusl include after: Before Friday prayers. Before Eid celebrations . Before making Umrah or Hajj . After washing a corpse. After converting to Islam ."

If a person of the Islamic faith has experienced any of these events, they must cleanse themselves spiritually through ghusl before engaging in any act of worship or prayer. [18] X Research source Ghusl is mandated in the Qur’an, with Allah stating: “O Believers [faith]! If you are in a state of major impurity [that requires ritual bath], then purify yourselves.” (Qur’an 5:6) [19] X Research source Ghusl is also mentioned in the Hadiths, where Aisha (a wife of the prophet Muhammad) asks her husband about whether ghusl is required after menses. He responds: “Let one of you take her water and lotus leaves and clean herself well, then let her pour water over her head and rub it vigorously so that it will reach the roots of her hair. Then let her pour the water over herself, then take a piece of cloth scented with musk and purify herself.” [20] X Research source"
