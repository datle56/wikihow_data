[1] X Research source You can usually find bottles of stamp pad ink at craft or office supply stores. It’s easiest to use stamp pad ink on solid-color ribbons. However, they're not great for two-tone ribbons."

      "content": "Remove the ribbon from the typewriter. There’s no one single way to remove ribbon from typewriters, since it depends on the model of the typewriter you’re using. Usually, though, you’ll have to remove the cover (if the typewriter has one), unlock any mechanisms holding the spools in place, and gently pull the ribbon spools off. Then, remove the ribbon from the ribbon vibrator—this is typically a rectangular piece of metal that holds the ribbon close to the paper. [3] X Research source You can take the ribbon out using your hands, or you can use a tool like tweezers to keep your hands clean of ink. If you’ve never changed the typewriter’s ribbon before, be sure to note the way the ribbon is threaded, so you can thread it back in later. If one or both spools are stuck, don’t yank! It could damage the typewriter. Instead, gently rock the stuck spool from side to side until it loosens. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Wind up the ribbon if it’s loose. Thankfully, you don’t have to apply ink to every section of the ribbon, so just wind any loose sections onto one of the spools. [5] X Research source Wrap it as tightly as possible so that the ink can permeate the entire ribbon."

      "title": "Place a drop of ink on one section of the ribbon.",
      "content": "Place a drop of ink on one section of the ribbon. Hold the ribbon above the dish, and slowly tilt the ink bottle towards the ribbon. The ink might come out on its own, but if not, lightly apply pressure to the bottle to release a drop of ink. Touch the bottle tip to the drop of ink, and move it around to coat the surface width. [6] X Research source Since the ribbon is wrapped around itself, the ink will “bleed” through the sections of ribbon underneath the surface. Don’t use more than 1 or 2 drops. A ribbon that’s sopping wet with ink isn’t usable. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Test your typewriter. Once you’ve reloaded the ribbon, test it by typing a few sentences onto a piece of paper. A properly re-inked typewriter ribbon should type cleanly, without any blotches or smearing, and will do so for months or years depending on how often you use it. [10] X Research source If you're getting patches of dry text, you might have missed some spots when inking, or didn't wind the ribbon tightly enough for the ink to soak through. A little bit of blotchy or \"filled\" text isn't unusual, especially if the type itself is dirty. But lots of smeared, splotchy, or illegible text usually means you used too much ink. Unfortunately, there's no way to fix this besides replacing the ribbon."

The specific way to remove the ribbon depends on each individual typewriter model, but you’ll typically have to take off the cover (if there is one), disengage anything keeping the spools in place, and lift out the ribbon spools. Then, take the ribbon out of the ribbon vibrator. The ribbon vibrator is usually a rectangular metal piece with the ribbon weaved through it, and rests close to the paper. [11] X Research source It's fine to remove the ribbon with your hands. If you don't want to get ink on your hands, though, tools like tweezers are also okay. If you’re not familiar with the typewriter model, make a mental note of how the ribbon is threaded, so you know how to put it back in. Be gentle when removing the spools—excessive force could break the spool holders. If a spool is stuck, lightly rock it from side to side until you can pull it out. [12] X Research source"

[14] X Research source If you don’t, though, just place the spools on separate sides of your work surface; this keeps the ribbon from getting knotted or wound around itself. [15] X Research source Make sure your workspace is a safe distance away from the typewriter. Getting WD-40 on your typewriter can cause it to malfunction. [16] X Research source"

It’s normal to get smudged or “blurry” text at first, so don’t panic if the initial type doesn’t come out cleanly—after a bit of use, you should start getting clear, readable text. [21] X Research source Re-inking using WD-40 has varying levels of success, but it will likely last at least a few months. If you used too much WD-40, you'll get incredibly wet or smeared text that doesn't clear up after use, and you'll need to wipe off the ribbon again (or replace it if it's too saturated)."
