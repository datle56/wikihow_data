      "title": "Remove the old cover and binding components.",
      "content": "Remove the old cover and binding components. Whether your current book cover is well-attached or hanging on by a thread, the first step to rebinding a book is to remove it. Place the book on a flat surface and use an x-acto knife to cut through the end sheets, mull, and cover material. Then, cut off any ripped pages, excess glue, or loose threads that are sticking out of the text block. [1] X Research source The mull is the strip of cloth attached to the back of the pages and connects them to the spine. It helps set the pages in place. The text block is the stack of pages that make up the book. If you have a paperback, it may be possible to rip the cover off without a knife."

      "title": "Measure the old covers and spine.",
      "content": "Measure the old covers and spine. If the original covers and spine are in good shape, measure them with a ruler so you know what size to make the new cover. Alternatively, measure the text block itself. If you choose the latter, add an additional 3/8 inch (0.95 cm) to the height and width to ensure the new cover fits properly. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Cut new covers out of book binding board.",
      "content": "Cut new covers out of book binding board. There are a few different materials you can use for this step, including Bristol board , chipboard , and stiff cardboard. With a sharp utility knife and a steel ruler, cut out two pieces for the front and back cover and a piece for the spine. [3] X Research source Before cutting the board, check the direction the grain runs by bending the board lightly in both directions. One side will bend more easily than the other, and this is the side you want facing up and down for your cover."

      "title": "Align the boards with your book cloth.",
      "content": "Align the boards with your book cloth. Select a piece of sturdy cotton or linen fabric that will act as the material for your book cover. Place the 3 pieces of board onto the cloth with 3/8 of an inch (0.95 cm) between each cover and the spine. Measure a 1 inch (2.5 cm) margin around the entire cover and cut the fabric into this large rectangular shape. [4] X Research source If you want, it’s also possible to use leather or faux leather for your book cover. Cotton or linen are easier to work with for beginners, though. Book cloth is another option. This fabric is specifically designed for book binding and helps prevent glue from seeping through."

      "content": "Glue the cloth to the boards. Add a thick layer of book binding glue or PVA glue to the backside of your board cutouts, then place them in the same position as when you measured the fabric. Cut the corners of the fabric off at a 45 degree angle and fold each over onto the inside of the covers. Add more binding glue to the inside and use a bone folder to stick the fabric in place.

      "content": "Glue end pages to the text block. Choose a sturdy stock paper and lay your textblock on top of it. Mark the height of the textblock and cut the paper to the same height and twice the width. Fold the end paper so the “wrong” sides are facing outward, then brush some PVA glue onto the spine edge of the first page of the text block and attach the end page along the crease. Do the same with the last page of the text block. [6] X Research source End pages need to be sturdy, as they glue the cover to the book. Another option is to cut two endings to the exact size of a text block page and sew them to the book with a needle and thread."

With the spine of the text block facing up, place the book between two weights to press the pages together tightly. Brush a thick, even layer of PVA glue onto the entirety of the spine and firmly press the cloth onto it. Let it dry completely. [7] X Research source If there are any loose threads, trim them off with a pair of scissors. Do not glue down the excess fabric on either side of the spine."

Attach the loose mull fabric and front end page, using a bone folder to smooth it out and securely glue it to the front cover. Repeat the same process with the back cover. [8] X Research source For extra security, glue the spine of the text block to the spine of the cover before gluing the covers down."

If you happen to have a book press , place the book inside and let it dry overnight. If not, place the book between heavy weight (like other books) and let it dry completely. [9] X Research source If you place the book between heavy objects, put some more wax paper between them in case the glue leaks. This way, you don’t have to worry about your other belongings getting damaged."
