      "title": "Carve downwards in small sections.",
      "content": "Carve downwards in small sections. Place your knife between the flesh and the pith at an angle. Gently whittle down a small section of rind, following the curve of the fruit. Continue cutting off sections until the entire fruit is exposed. [2] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Cut off any remaining pith.",
      "content": "Cut off any remaining pith. While the pith is edible, it has an unpleasant, bitter taste. Carve away any large white areas of pith until only the flesh remains. [3] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Cut into the center of the fruit to begin segmenting.",
      "content": "Cut into the center of the fruit to begin segmenting. Hold the grapefruit in one hand and find the white vertical lines than run from north to south poles. Slice into the center with your knife along the one of the lines until your blade reaches the center of the fruit. [4] X Research source Alternatively, once you have removed the rind and pith, you can cut the grapefruit into disks or even smaller pieces to use in cooking or salads."

    {
      "title": "Cut the other side of the segment.",

    {
      "title": "Scoop out the remaining segments.",
      "content": "Scoop out the remaining segments. After removing the first segment, make another incision on the other side of the next segment’s membrane. Hold your knife vertically along the spine of the segment, with the blade sandwiched between the flesh and the membrane. Twist in an outward motion with gentle pressure to scoop out the segment, leaving behind the membrane. Continue scooping until the entire fruit is segmented. [7] X Research source Alternatively, you can continue to cut along either side of each segment membrane, as with the first segment. This technique is easier but wastes more flesh than scooping. If you like, squeeze out and collect any remaining juice from the cut away pieces."

Peel back the rind and work your way around the entire fruit until no skin remains. [9] X Research source Before peeling, it may help to prep the rind by “scoring” or gently marking lines with a knife along the skin from the stem end to the bottom of the fruit.

      "content": "Puncture the membrane. Use your fingertips to tear the membrane near the spine of the segment while leaving the flesh intact. If any membrane peeled off on its own when you halved the fruit, begin segmenting there. [12] X Research source You can also use a knife to puncture the membrane, making a slit near the segment spine. A knife may be necessary if your grapefruit’s skin is very tough.

Slide your finger or thumb underneath the unexposed side of the same segment, between the flesh and the membrane, and pull the segment out. [14] X Research source Some seeds may fall out as you peel. Remove larger seeds before eating. [15] X Research source"

Try to slide your thumb between the pith and the fruit before you peel back the rind. You can also perforate the pith by sliding your thumb all the way around the outer edge of the quarter. Peel the skin off the remaining quarters."
