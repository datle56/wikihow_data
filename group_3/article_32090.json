      "content": "Write down everything you will need for your trip. A packing list is an excellent way to get organized before you start packing. Write down everything you think you will need for your trip, such as underwear, socks, pants, shorts, T-shirts, sweater, jacket, swimsuit, shoes, toiletries, phone charger, jewelry, or anything else you want to bring along. [1] X Research source Make sure to specify if there are any special items you want to bring on your trip, such as your favorite dress and pair of shoes for a night out. Include in the list any documents you’ll need as well, such as your passport and copies of your passport, driver’s license, plane tickets, and hotel reservation confirmation printouts. If you take any medications (prescription or over-the-counter), make sure to list these on your packing list as well."

      "content": "Follow the 5-4-3-2-1 rule to choose clothes for weeklong trips. If you want a simple way to decide how many items to pack for a short 5-7 day trip, stick to this rule. You may have to do a load of laundry once during your trip, but most hotels have laundry facilities. Choose items that you can mix and match and pack the following items: [2] X Research source 5 pairs of socks and 5 pairs of underwear 4 tops, such as T-shirts, tank tops, or button-downs 3 bottoms, such as jeans, trousers, or skirts 2 pairs of shoes, such as flats, heels, or sneakers 1 hat, such as a wide-brimmed sunhat, baseball cap, or knit hat (for colder climates)"

      "content": "Plan what you’ll bring on the trip based on activities, not trip length. A common mistake people make is to bring 1 outfit for every day of the week, but this might not account for what types of clothing they’ll actually need. Instead, think about what you have planned for the trip and what you will need the most of. Then, plan out what to bring based on what you’ll be doing. [3] X Research source For example, if you have plans to go hiking on 1 or more days of the trip, you’ll need a weather-appropriate active wear outfit, such as leggings or shorts, a T-shirt or tank top, and a sports bra (for women). If you’ll be going out to dinner at a fancy restaurant during your trip, you may want to bring a dress or a suit."

      "content": "Choose a color scheme to ensure that you can mix and match. Limiting the items in your suitcase is an important part of fitting everything in. One trick for limiting yourself is deciding on a color scheme for the items you will pack. This will help to ensure that you can mix and match everything you pack and create more looks with fewer items. [4] X Research source For example, you could stick with a black and white and denim scheme and only pack black and white items of clothing, such as 2 white tops, 2 black tops, 2 pairs of jeans or jean shorts, and 1 little black dress or suit. Or, you could opt for earth-toned items, such as brown, beige, cream, and khaki-colored items."

This will allow you to bring your favorite brand of shampoo, conditioner, body wash, lotion, toothpaste, and anything else you regularly use without taking up a huge section of your bag. [5] X Research source For extra space-saving power, choose toiletries and makeup that can do double-duty, such as a combination moisturizer, sunblock, and foundation, or lipstick that you can also use as a blush.

[7] X Expert Source Marty Stevens-Heebner, SMM-C, CPO® Certified Professional Organizer & Senior Move Manager Expert Interview. 14 January 2020. Folding your items and then rolling them up tightly can help to save space in your bag and the items may even end up with fewer wrinkles than if you folded them. Fold an item neatly first, and then roll it in one direction to compress it. Place a rubber band around it or slip it into a re-sealable plastic bag to keep it in this shape. [8] X Research source If you have any items that wrinkle easily, keep them unfolded and lay them over top of everything in your suitcase instead. For example, if you are bringing a blazer or a silk blouse, these items might end up wrinkled if you roll them."

      "title": "Try packing cubes if you want to keep items separated.",
      "content": "Try packing cubes if you want to keep items separated. Packing cubes are small bags that you can fill with items. The bag will compress your items while also keeping them separate from everything else. You can even get packing cubes in different colors if you will be sharing a suitcase with someone else or if you want to color-code the items in your suitcase. [10] X Research source For example, if you’re sharing a bag with your significant other, you could use red packing cubes and they could use black packing cubes. Or, if you want to color code your items using packing cubes, try placing all of your underwear and socks in a yellow cube, tops in a green cube, and bottoms in a red cube."

      "content": "Fill contact lens cases with small amounts of eye cream and moisturizer. Instead of bringing multiple bottles and jars of lotion, cleanser, or whatever else you use in your skincare routine, get a couple of contact lens cases and add a few squirts or a dollop of your product. Then close the lids tightly, place the contact lens case into a plastic bag, and pack it in your suitcase. [11] X Research source This is a great option if you don’t have or don’t want to buy sample sizes of your facial products. It will also save even more space since contact lens cases are so small. Make sure that you label the compartments so you will know what you put into each chamber."

      "content": "Use press-and-seal plastic wrap to organize any jewelry you bring . This kind of plastic wrap will stick to itself when you press 2 pieces together, so you can use it to prevent your jewelry from getting tangled in transit. Lay out a sheet of plastic wrap, arrange your jewelry on it, and then lay another piece over the first one. Press around the edges of each piece of jewelry to lock them into their own little chambers. Then, roll up the plastic wrap and slip it into a side pocket or shoe in your suitcase. [12] X Research source You can purchase a roll of press-and-seal plastic wrap in a grocery store. Another option is to place your jewelry into the chambers in a pill box. Place 1 necklace or pair of earrings into each chamber. This works well for small pieces of jewelry, but it might not work for bulkier items like watches and statement earrings."

      "title": "Lay out everything you want to bring before you start packing.",
      "content": "Lay out everything you want to bring before you start packing. When you’re ready to pack, gather everything together and lay it out on a table or bed next to your suitcase. This will help you to ensure that you have not forgotten anything. It’s also a good opportunity to weed out any items that you won’t really need. [13] X Research source Look over everything and eliminate anything that you are packing “just in case.” [14] X Research source For example, if you have included a sweatshirt in your items for a trip to the Caribbean just in case the weather turns chilly, remove it. If it does get cold and you need a sweatshirt, you can always buy one."

When you’re ready to start filling up the suitcase, start by lining the bottom of the bag with your heaviest items, such as your shoes, jeans, and sweaters. Push the items together so they are tightly-packed in. [15] X Research source Also, consider where the items will be when the suitcase is upright. Place the heavier items, such as sneakers or boots into the section of the suitcase that will be nearest the ground. You might also consider wearing your heaviest or bulkiest items if it’s practical to do so, such as wearing a sweater and your bulkiest shoes during the plane or train ride to your destination."

If you don’t want to put items right into your shoes, place them into plastic bags first. [16] X Research source As a bonus, filling shoes and hats with items will help them to keep their shape rather than getting squished by the other items in your suitcase."

      "content": "Fill external pockets on your suitcase with small items and toiletries. Suitcases often have pockets on the outside of the bag that you can pack with small items, such as toiletries, electronic accessories, and socks. If you run out of room inside your bag and you still have some small items to pack, start filling the external pockets. This is also a great place for your toiletries since it will make it quick and easy to grab them. [21] X Research source You can also place a few items in the external pockets that you might want to access during your trip, such as your phone charger, a book, headphones, or an eye mask. Having your toiletries separate from your clothing will also make it easier for airport workers to check them if needed."
