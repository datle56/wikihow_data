      "title": "Remove any visible fertilizer.",
      "content": "Remove any visible fertilizer. If the fertilizer is a powder, and you can see it on the plant or topsoil, removing it will prevent further overfertilization. Additionally, if the fertilizer salts have created a crust (typically white), that must also be removed. [1] X Research source Use caution when scooping the fertilizer away to ensure you don’t further distress or damage the plant or roots."

      "title": "Leach the soil with water.",
      "content": "Leach the soil with water. This will move the fertilizer further away from the plant's root system, helping to prevent additional overfertilization and permitting the plant's roots to begin to heal. [2] X Research source Use distilled, room-temperature water to leach nutrients from the soil, if possible. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Flood the root system.",
      "content": "Flood the root system. If the plant is in your garden, flood the soil around the root system before allowing the water to continue to drip at the plant's base for 30 minutes. [4] X Trustworthy Source National Resources Defence Council Multinational environmental advocacy group focused on grassroots activism and legislative action Go to source It's easiest to flood the root system using a garden hose, which creates a continuous stream."

      "content": "Allow the water to drain away. If the plant is in a pot, fill the pot with water and allow it to drain out the bottom. Repeat this step four times in order to make sure all the fertilizer is washed, or leached, away from the plant's roots.

      "content": "Remove damaged foliage. Using a pair of scissors, cut off damaged, misshapen, or wilting leaves. Even though you can rescue an overfed plant, the damaged leaves cannot be revived. Removing them is important to ensuring the plant's future health, and if they are permitted to remain, your plant may become a victim of pests or diseases.

    {
      "title": "Replant if possible.",
      "content": "Replant if possible. If the plant was severely overfed, transferring it to new, fresh soil after the leaching process is complete will provide your plant and its roots an opportunity to heal. Choose a new spot in your garden, well away from the fertilized area, or repot a plant with fresh soil. [7] X Research source If your plant is too large to move or you don’t have any available space left, add new soil to the container or plot instead."

      "title": "Avoid fertilizing your plant for several weeks.",
      "content": "Avoid fertilizing your plant for several weeks. If your plant has been overfed, do not provide it more fertilizer until it appears healthy again (3 to 4 weeks). Allow time for your plant and its roots to recover from the strain of an overabundance of fertilizer. [8] X Research source"

      "title": "Choose a fertilizer without nitrogen.",
      "content": "Choose a fertilizer without nitrogen. When the time comes to begin feeding your plant again, you can prevent many of the negative effects of overfertilization by using nitrogen-free fertilizer. [9] X Research source Use only one quarter or one half of the recommended amount of fertilizer as directed on the package. [10] X Research source"

      "content": "Watch for weak or dying plants. If you’ve provided the proper amounts of sunlight and water, plants or seedlings that are weak, stunted, or dying could be suffering from an overabundance of nutrients. Look out for limp, wilted, crinkled, brittle, or very small roots, stems, and foliage."
