For this reason, you should start at one end of the stool and methodically work to the opposite end. Generally, you should paint from the top down to prevent the formation of drips. To get into this habit, you may also want to sand, clean, and prime from the top down, too. [2] X Research source"

When sanding: Wear a dust mask to prevent lung irritation or damage from accidentally breathing in dust produced while sanding. Use a medium grit (60 - 100 rating) sandpaper. [4] X Research source Sand with medium pressure and overlapping strokes to prevent yourself from missing spots. Target bumps, loose paint, and uneven surfaces when sanding. Sand until the entire surface is even and smooth. [5] X Research source Even if the primer, paint, and sealer you've chosen for this job claims no sanding is necessary, sanding will always improve the end result. [6] X Research source"

Sanding will usually create a fine film of dust on the surface of your stool. This can cause clumping or create unevenness in your primer coat. Dampen a clean cloth, and wipe all surfaces of the stool thoroughly. Then: Allow the surface of the stool to dry completely before priming. You can speed the this process by following the damp cloth wipe with a clean, dry cloth wipe. Mix your primer thoroughly, then dip your brush in it. Wipe excess primer on the inner lip of its can, then apply the primer to your entire stool in a thin coat. Follow your primer's label instructions for the best results, but generally, after ten minutes your stool should be ready for another coat. Typically, multiple thin coats are better than a single thick one. You may even be able to see the grain of your wood through the primer. Don't worry, this is natural. [8] X Research source"
