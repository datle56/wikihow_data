      "content": "Match how much effort they put in to give them control of the conversation. Since Bumble matches expire if both people don’t message within a day of the conversation starting, a quick response like this shows that you still want to get to know your match. Since you replied with a similar message, your match will have to think of a way to keep the conversation going so you’re not pressured to. “Hey you! 😊” “Well hi there, stranger.” “Howdy 🤠” Looking for some more unique conversation starters?

      "content": "A quick and cute response is perfect if you aren’t sure what else to say. If you’re really at a loss for words, there’s nothing wrong with a quick emoji or GIF. Your match will think that you’re being playful and may start a new conversation topic afterward. [1] X Research source Try using 👀 to say “Hey, I see you too.” Share a GIF of a cute animal waving as a way to say hi back to them. Send a GIF of a kitten and say, “Are you kitten me with that opener? Got anything else to say?”"

      "content": "A quick question keeps your convo casual and low-stakes. You can ask how their day is or what they’ve been up to recently. Your match will appreciate that you want to learn a little more about their life without getting too personal right away. You can always ask follow-up questions based on how they reply to your initial question. [2] X Research source “Hey Sam! How’s your day been?” “Hi hi! What are you up to?” “Hello! 🙂 Have you had a good week so far?” Not sure how to ask how they’re doing? Take a look at this article for more tips on talking on Bumble."

      "title": "Playfully calling your match out can help you break the ice.",
      "content": "Playfully calling your match out can help you break the ice. Your match probably knows that “hey” isn’t the best opener in the world, so it’s okay to joke around about it. Encourage your match to send a better message as a follow-up instead. Just be sure to use an emoji or two so your message sounds light-hearted. [3] X Research source “Is that all you got? C’mon, I know you got a better opener than that 😉” “Did you even read my bio? I gave you so much to work with! 😜” “Oh, I haven’t heard that one before 😉 what else do you got?”"

      "title": "Being direct lets your match know that you’re serious.",
      "content": "Being direct lets your match know that you’re serious. Your match must have been interested in you if they swiped right and started the conversation, so don’t be afraid to find out what they like about you. Your match will recognize that you’re into them too and that you don’t want to waste your time playing games. “What about me caught your eye that you wanted to keep messaging? 😉” “Tell me if I’m wrong, but did you want to keep chatting just based on my dashing good looks? 😏” “I matched with you because you look like you have a lot of fun. Your turn to tell me why you swiped right!”"

    {
      "title": "Your match will love that you took the time getting to know them.",
      "content": "Your match will love that you took the time getting to know them. Your match spent time picking photos and writing their bio, so you can get to know them better. Scroll through your match’s pics and profile and look for something that you find interesting. Bring it up early in your conversation to show that you pay attention to what they’ve shared and want to know them on a deeper level. [4] X Research source “Hey is for horses, like the ones in your pics! It’s so cool that you like to ride!” “Wow, it looks like you like to travel a lot. I’ve always wanted to explore the world too! Where’s your favorite place to go?” “There’s no way that you’ve never seen The Office ! We’re going to have to change that!”"

      "content": "A little flattery lets your match know you’re really into them. Even though your match didn’t give you a lot to work with, you can still give them a generic compliment. Try to avoid saying anything too forward about your match’s looks. Just let them know that you’re excited that they messaged you so they feel special. [5] X Research source “Wow, I feel honored that you’re chatting with me 😊 how’d I get so lucky?” “You seem really special so I can’t wait to get to know you 🙂” “I don’t usually match when someone says ‘hey,’ but after reading through your bio, I had to make an exception 😉” Level up your game by sending a Bumble Compliment to show that you’re really interested!"

      "content": "Getting your match to laugh starts the conversation on a good note. As Cantarella advises, one of the best ways to start a flirty conversation is to “use humor!” You could joke about starting the conversation or pointing out something funny you noticed on their profile. Even a silly pickup line might work to make them smile and start chatting. Just make sure you use an emoji or type out “haha” or “LOL” so your match knows you’re only kidding around. [6] X Research source “I guess I’m like a polar bear because here I am breaking the ice LOL.” “What has 2 thumbs and is ready to knock your socks off? Spoiler alert: it’s me 😜” “I don’t have my library card, but I still want to check you out 😉”"

      "title": "They’ll have to respond with a longer answer to keep the conversation alive.",
      "content": "They’ll have to respond with a longer answer to keep the conversation alive. Start your questions with “what” or “how” since your match won’t be able to answer them with 1 word. You could ask them something about their personal life, what they like to do, or a classic icebreaker to get them talking. Bumble even has a built-in feature so you can easily ask icebreaker questions and keep the conversation moving. [7] X Research source “Hi! What are the biggest goals you want to accomplish this year?” “How would you describe your perfect day off?” “Hey there! What are the 5 things you’d bring with you on a desert island?”"

      "title": "You’ll instantly form a bond if you both like the same things.",
      "content": "You’ll instantly form a bond if you both like the same things. Bumble lets your match list all of their interests, so scroll through them and see if they’ve mentioned anything you like too. Your match will want to know that you’re similar since it could make you more compatible. Ask them a follow-up question so they have something more to respond to. [8] X Research source “Hey there! It looks like you love to roller skate and OMG me too! 🙂 Where are your favorite places to go?” “You and I have the exact same music taste! Have you seen any good concerts recently?” “Wow, I loved Squid Game ! What did you think of that ending?” If someone matches with you, it’s very likely you’ll have an interest in common, so make sure to put your top interests in your profile, too, Cantarella advises.

      "title": "Only saying “hey” may mean your match isn’t very invested.",
      "content": "Only saying “hey” may mean your match isn’t very invested. Only women can message first on Bumble, so they may only send a message to save you as a match. Even though a short opener like “hey” isn't always a sign that your match isn’t interested, it might mean they don’t want to put the effort into a full conversation. Think about whether you want to stay in contact and keep talking to them, and don’t be afraid to move on to someone who messages you a longer opening message. Remember, “honesty is the best policy,” according to Cantarella. Cantarella also says it’s okay to try a few times to get them engaged in conversation, but if their one-word answers continue, it’s probably best to just move on."
