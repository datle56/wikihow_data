      "content": "If your dog is too big to fit under an airline seat, you can’t do this. You can usually bring a dog in the cabin with them so long as they’re small enough to fit in a carrier that fits underneath the seat in front of you on the plane. They must also be able to stand up and turn around in their crate. If your dog can’t meet these requirements, they can’t fly in the cabin. [1] X Research source The dimensions of the area under the seat differ from plane to plane, and airline to airline. You can look them up online, but in most cases you’ll be restricted to flying with toy breeds."

Smaller airlines, niche regional providers, and certain budget airlines often don’t allow non-service dogs on the plane—even if they do fit in a carry on. Make sure dogs are allowed with whatever airline you’re thinking of booking a ticket with. Then, review their policies for bringing dogs on their planes.

This will demonstrate that your dog isn’t carrying any infectious diseases and that they’re not going to spread fleas all over the airplane. [3] X Research source"

If there isn’t though, call the airline to book your ticket with them directly. Explain that you’re bringing your dog and they’ll walk you through the process to reserve your dog’s spot on the plane. [4] X Research source The fee for bringing a pet on board is typically $50-300 depending on who you choose to fly with. Airlines typically have a hard limit on the number of pets they let on a plane. If you don’t tell the airline you’re bringing a pet, they may fill up to their max and refuse to let you board with your dog. [5] X Research source"

These carriers are typically soft, and meet certain requirements the airlines have in terms of weight and shape. [6] X Research source Buy airline-approved pet carriers online or in a pet store. Most airline carriers list requirements for carriers you can keep your dog in on their website."

Typically, it’s just a checkup to confirm that your dog doesn’t have any infectious diseases. Schedule a visit with your vet, explain that you’re flying with your pup, and give them the paperwork they need to sign off on. [9] X Research source Bring this paperwork with you to the airport on the day of the flight. You may need to show it to the attendant as you’re boarding the plane. Some airlines do not require a health certificate. You may be able to skip this step depending on who you’re flying with. Even if it isn’t a requirement, it’s still a good idea to see a vet just to make sure they’re healthy enough to fly."

If they get a little anxious or they act out when they’re overwhelmed, ask your vet about sedatives for travel. They may give you something to calm your dog down throughout the flight. If they do, go on a “dry run” a few days before to make sure your dog can handle the medication if your vet thinks it’s a good idea.

If your dog can get a little anxious but your vet doesn’t think sedatives are appropriate, get a Thundershirt or a calming collar. A Thundershirt is basically a comfortable but tight sweater that will keep your dog relaxed. Calming collars have pheromones that will help reduce anxiety. Don’t give them any OTC anxiety medication without vet approval. [13] X Research source The collar or calming shirt are also good options if you’re worried about giving your dog medication but you still want to help them take the edge off."

Put all of your dog’s vaccine tags on their collar, and make sure your phone number and name are listed on at least one of their tags. Put a label on their crate as well, just in case someone picks it up thinking that it’s lost luggage. [14] X Research source If you haven’t already, consider microchipping your dog so that they can be returned to you if they end up getting lose and running away. The odds are very low that you’re going to be separated from your dog, but it’s better to be safe than sorry. Also, you’ll have a bit of peace of mind!"

On top of that, this will minimize the odds that they need to poop mid-flight, which might be a major pain to clean up. Give them water periodically throughout the day, but cut back a few hours leading up to the flight. [15] X Research source If you’re flying late at night, it’s a little cruel not to feed your dog.

Dogs are calmer when they’re tuckered out, and if you do this right, your dog may just happily sleep through the flight!

Aside from the fact that security can be a bit of a pain, you’ll want time to give your dog a mini-walk before you go into the airport, or after you get past security. Showing up at least 1 hour than you would if you were alone also gives your dog plenty of time to take in the sights and smells of the airport. This can help desensitize them to the chaos, which will help them stay calm on the plane. [19] X Research source Bringing your dog through security seems scary, but it’s usually straightforward. Your carrier will go through the X-ray machine, and you’ll hold your dog while you go through the scanner.

[21] X Research source If they don’t go to the bathroom before you go into the airport and they end up needing to go, you’ll have to leave the airport and go back through security again if there’s no pet relief area.

It doesn’t matter if your dog is a service animal either, so make sure you give them plenty of reassurance at the gate. [22] X Research source You know your dog best.
