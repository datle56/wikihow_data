      "content": "Liquid dish soap breaks apart oil and grease safely on any type of fabric. Choose a dish soap that is specifically labeled for dissolving oil since these often have a special type of oil-eating bacteria as an ingredient. Dish soap may also work on older set-in stains as well as fresh ones. [1] X Research source Blot up excess grease with a paper towel. Apply dish soap to the stain and work it in with an old toothbrush. Let the soap sit for about 30 minutes so it soaks into the fabric. Toss your clothing in the washer on the warmest cycle the fabric can safely tolerate. Dry your clothes if you don’t see the stain anymore. Air dry the garment if any grease remains since the heat from the dryer will set the stain into the fabric. Looking for other ways to remove grease stains from your clothes?
