      "content": "Gently pick the cat up if it appears to have calmed down. If the cat will let you touch it without reacting aggressively, attempt to pick it up. Place your hand gently under its abdomen. Using your fingers, lightly grasp its front legs. Raise the cat slowly upwards, and press it gently against your body. Gently hold its chin with your other hand. Stop immediately and let the cat go if it begins to act aggressively again."

Hold its front legs with your fingers. Use the rest of your arm to gently press the cat against your body. Hold the cat’s head with your left hand. Do not attempt this method if the cat is violent. If the cat becomes aggressive in the midst of attempting it, stop and try another technique."

If the cat appears aggressive and scared, you can attempt to gently pick it up by the scruff of the neck, supporting its back feet with your other hand. This may calm the cat and allow you to control it. You should not use this technique on an adult cat (over 6 months). [3] X Research source In many cases, picking a cat up by the scruff of the neck will restrict its ability to breathe and only make it more aggressive. [4] X Research source Some experts recommend never picking a cat up by the scruff of the neck.

Approach the cat slowly, from above it, while holding a thick blanket or large towel. Place the blanket over the entirety of the cat. Do not throw the blanket.

Once you have picked up the cat, you can put it and the blanket in a crate or carrier that is large enough for the cat to move around in and get out from under the blanket. Otherwise, carefully let the cat out of the blanket into the crate or carrier. Close the door immediately, and take it to a vet or animal shelter if necessary. Alternatively, you can place the blanket-wrapped cat in another room where it will not be disturbed by other people or animals. Wait for it to calm down before handling it further. Tossing a treat inside the room may help."
