However, if the papules are causing you significant distress, talk to your doctor. They will assess the papules to ensure that they are benign and then you can discuss treatment options with them.

      "content": "Ask about removing the papules with a CO2 laser. This is the most effective treatment for PPPs. The laser uses a high level of heat to remove the papules, but you will be under anesthesia during the treatment so you will not feel the laser. Within 5 to 7 days after treatment, the tissue regenerates around the glans, or head of the penis, leaving behind a smooth appearance. [3] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source You may experience pain after the treatment, but your doctor can prescribe medication to help you manage the pain. Usually 1 laser treatment session is enough to remove all of the papules, but in some cases 2 to 3 treatments may be required."

      "title": "Look into radiosurgery to remove the PPPs.",
      "content": "Look into radiosurgery to remove the PPPs. If CO2 laser treatment is not an option, your doctor may recommend radiosurgery, which involves exposing the papules to a high dose of radiation. This will cause the tissue that makes up the papules to die and fall off. Although this option is less effective than CO2 laser treatment, it is more effective than the other options. [4] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Family Physicians Organization devoted to improving the health of patients, families, and communities Go to source Radiosurgery, also known as Cyberknife, does not involve cutting into your penis to remove the papules. The surgery is performed using targeted radiation. It is painless and takes about 30 minutes to 2 hours. However, you may need more than 1 treatment to remove all of the papules. During the procedure your doctor and the other healthcare technicians will be in another room, but you can still talk to them and they can talk to you using an intercom system. Your doctor performs the surgery by controlling a robotic arm on the machine that delivers the radiation.

This form of PPP removal is likely to cause scarring and recovery may be quite painful. However, your doctor can prescribe medication to help manage the pain. [6] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Excisional surgery is not used often for removing PPPs since it can cause scarring. However, if other options are not recommended or available to you, then this might be what your doctor suggests."

[7] X Research source This procedure is also known as hyfrecation, which is a form of surgery that uses a device called a hyrefractor to deliver a targeted dose of electricity to the PPPs. The electricity causes the PPP tissue to dry out and then the surgeon uses a scraping device to remove the PPPs. This treatment option will cause scarring and it requires anesthesia. The recovery can be quite painful as well, but your doctor can prescribe a medication to help manage the pain."

The treatment may cause a mild burning sensation, but it does not usually require anesthesia.
