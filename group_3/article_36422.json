      "title": "Clean the affected area with toothpaste.",
      "content": "Clean the affected area with toothpaste. Squeeze a pea-sized amount of toothpaste onto a napkin or paper towel. Wipe the affected area with a vigorous back-and-forth motion. After the permanent marker has been completely removed, wipe the affected area with a damp cloth, then dry it with a dry cloth. For stubborn stains, apply the toothpaste and let it sit for five minutes before wiping it away. This will work best with a toothpaste that contains baking soda as a main ingredient. Gel toothpastes will probably be ineffective. This method is most effective when cleaning wood, televisions, dishes, and painted walls."
