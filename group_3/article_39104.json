      "content": "Choose a pattern. There are lots of free robe patterns available on the Internet, so you really don’t need to buy one. However, Internet patterns will not provide you with paper pattern pieces to cut out the fabric pieces for your robe. If you want your robe to be in a specific style and size, visit a craft supply store to purchase a pattern. [1] X Research source If you are new to sewing, look into easy patterns with a simple belt around the waist. If you are more experienced, opt for intermediate to advanced patterns that feature buttons, special collars, or other intricate details."

      "title": "Select your fabric.",
      "content": "Select your fabric. You can make a robe from just about any type of fabric you want. Consider when and how you plan to use the robe before choosing a fabric. Also, consider your budget and the price of the fabric since you will need at least 2 yards of fabric to make your robe. Patterns list the recommended type of fabric on the package, as well as how much you will need. Make sure to check the pattern’s recommendations before you purchase your fabric for the robe. [2] X Research source Make a warm winter robe using fleece or flannel material, create a lightweight summer robe using cotton or satin, or sew a water absorbent robe using terry cloth. Your pattern will recommend a different amount of fabric depending on the width of the fabric. For example, you may need 2.5 yards (2.3 m) of fabric that is 45 inches (110 cm) wide or 2 yards (1.8 m) of fabric that is 60 inches (150 cm) wide. A good way to anticipate how much fabric you'll need for a robe is to imagine the body as a large rectangle (length being the height of the person and width being the measurement of the arms outstretched). Most fabrics come in widths of 45” or 60”, so you'd need twice the length of the height to have enough fabric for the front and back of a robe in most cases. Some robe patterns available on the Internet encourage you to use an old sheet as your robe fabric. This is a great way to repurpose a sheet and save money on fabric!"

      "content": "Decide if you want to add embellishments. Most robes are functional and they close with a simple sash around the waist. However, you can embellish a robe with special types of trim, closures, and other details. Consider what you would like to add to your robe to customize it, or just check the list on your pattern and get the recommended items. [3] X Research source Embroider a monogram onto a robe for a personalized look, add decorative buttons down the front for a fancier closure, or sew trim onto the bottom of the robe for added interest. Patterns usually include a list of any embellishments that are required, so make sure to check your pattern before you start sewing."

      "content": "Cut out the paper pattern pieces along the desired size lines. Each pattern will include options for 2 to 3 different sizes. Identify the size you will need. Then, use sharp scissors to cut all of the paper pattern pieces along the same size lines. To ensure that you cut out the right size for all pieces, you may want to trace along the size lines with a red pencil or highlighter before you cut them. [4] X Research source Most patterns will instruct you to cut out between 6 and 12 different pieces to sew your robe. Make sure that you cut out all of the required pieces!"

      "content": "Fold the fabric according to the pattern instructions. Folding the fabric properly is necessary to ensure that you have all the required pieces to sew the robe. Usually, you will be instructed to fold the fabric in half so that the raw edges of your fabric are lined up. [5] X Research source For example, you may need to cut one or more of the pieces along the fold of your fabric to create a larger piece, such as for the back of the robe or sleeves. You may be able to cut out other pieces from any area of the fabric, such as for the robe’s front panels or sash."

      "content": "Pin the paper pieces to the fabric as indicated by the pattern. When you have your fabric folded as indicated by the pattern, lay each of your paper pieces on the fabric. Sewing patterns will often feature a map of how to arrange the pieces. Use this as your guide. Once you have fit all of the pieces on the fabric, pin them into place by inserting straight pins through the edges of the paper pieces and both layers of fabric. Use pins with rounded ends so that they don’t go all the way through the fabric and get lost. [6] X Research source Your pattern instructions may indicate a different layout for fabric that is 45 inches (110 cm) wide versus fabric that is 60 inches (150 cm) wide. Be sure to use the correct map for your fabric’s width."

      "content": "Cut the fabric along the edges of the pattern pieces. Once the pieces are secured, cut along the outer edges of the pattern pieces. Make sure to cut out any notches as indicated on the paper pattern pieces as well. These are essential for properly lining up your robe pieces. [7] X Research source Do not cut any of the folded areas if the pattern has indicated that you should line the piece up with a fold. It is important to keep these larger pieces intact. Keep the pieces separated after cutting them. It is helpful to leave the pattern pieces pinned to them until you are ready to use each piece."

      "content": "Read your pattern’s instructions before sewing the pieces together. After you have cut out all of the pieces for the robe, check your pattern’s instructions for how to sew them together. You will most likely need to sew the front panels of the robe to the back panels first. Then, you will sew the sleeves onto the front and back panels. After that, you will just have the sash or other closure and any embellishments you are adding. If there is an unfamiliar abbreviation or term, check the pattern for a glossary or explanation."

      "content": "Line up the fabric pieces with the wrong sides facing each other. When you sew 2 pieces together, make sure that the wrong sides (non-print or inside) of the fabric are facing each other. [8] X Research source This will create a seam on the inside of the robe so that it will be hidden. Some patterns will feature instructions for how to tack down the inner seams on your robe, but this is optional and not necessary, especially if you have chosen a comfortable robe fabric."

      "title": "Sew a straight stitch",
      "content": "Sew a straight stitch 0.5 in (1.3 cm) from the fabric edges. Check your pattern for an exact stitch recommendation, but you can use a straight stitch unless the pattern advises you to do otherwise. Position the needle on your sewing machine above the fabric so that you will be stitching 0.5 in (1.3 cm) from the raw edges. Apply gentle pressure to the pedal to start your machine. Use your hands to guide the fabric under presser foot as the machine pulls it through. [9] X Research source The straight stitch is usually the default setting or setting #1 on a sewing machine. Consult your sewing machine’s instruction manual if you are unsure about how to set the machine to the straight stitch setting. Although it will take much longer than using a sewing machine would, you can sew the robe by hand. Thread a needle with a 24 inches (61 cm) strand of thread and insert the threaded needle in and out of the 2 layers of fabric to create a straight stitch."

      "content": "Match up any notches as you sew. These are indicated on your paper pattern pieces and you should have cut them out along with cutting out the fabric pieces, but you can do that now if you did not already do so. Cut along the edges of the notches just as you did with the edges of your pattern pieces. [10] X Research source Notches are most common on the shoulder areas of sleeves to ensure a proper fit and seam alignment, but you may also find darts and notches in other areas of the pattern."

After you have sewn all of the pieces together, fold the edges of the sleeves, the bottom of the robe, and the inner edges of the robe (front and neckline) by 0.5 in (1.3 cm). Fold the fabric so that the raw edge will be hidden inside of the robe. Pin these edges in place, and then sew about 0.25 in (0.64 cm) from the fold to secure the hem. [11] X Research source You can use a straight stitch or a zigzag stitch to secure the hem. To zigzag stitch, set your sewing machine to the zigzag stitch setting. Position the fabric under the presser foot so that the needle is about 0.25 in (0.64 cm) from the raw edge of the fabric. Then, apply pressure to the pedal and guide the fabric to keep it straight, which may be more difficult than with a straight stitch since the needle will be going back and forth. [12] X Research source Check your pattern for a stitch recommendation if you are unsure about the type to use."
