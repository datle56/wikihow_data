It's best to check ahead of time to see if you need to get a permit. Contact your city permit office for more information. You may also be able to look the information up online."

Some may twist off, though. It just depends on your fan. If you can't figure it out, try looking up the fan on the internet for help. [4] X Research source The screws will likely be near the ceiling. You may need to slide the canopy over a notch on one screw to pull it down. [5] X Research source"

[6] X Expert Source Allen Lee Home Improvement Specialist Expert Interview. 10 July 2020. All you do is place the voltage tester up near the wires, and it will indicate whether the wires are hot or not. Check each wire separately. [7] X Research source Read the directions for your particular tester to see what indicators it uses. Some use a green light if there's no power and a red light if there is power. Others will chirp as they get near hot wires. It's a good idea to test your voltage tester on an outlet first. You can stick in the hot side (small side) of an outlet to test if it's working. [8] X Research source Keep in mind, these readers only work on plastic-insulated wires, not metal-insulated wires."

It shouldn't wiggle around, and it should be screwed into the ceiling. Also, look at where the wires come out. It should have a plastic connector around the hole, so that the wires are up against the edge of the mount (because the mount is metal). [16] X Research source If you have a problem with any of the above, you may need to replace the mount or the wiring. If that's the case, you'll likely want to call in a professional."

[21] X Research source You may also need to attach the ball mount, though some may have this attached already. Place it on the downrod, and secure it with the pin. [22] X Research source Some people install the blades while the fan is still on the ground. However, that is up to you.
