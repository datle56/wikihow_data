Stores that do not sell alcoholic beverages do not have to take any alcohol containers ,but they do have to take empties of non-alcohol containers with deposit as long as they sell beverages.

If you plan on cashing very large quantities, such as bringing a box truck full of bottle from Valsetz, Oregon to the Portland metro area, call the retailers listed below about two weeks in advance to confirm they take bottles.

Bottle Bill rules are very complicated, but the specific stores listed below are screened. Example locations listed in this article are only relevant to the specific address. If you're uncertain about the requirements of a store at a specific address is required to accept, direct questions to OLCC, not the store. While illegal refusals by stores is very common, some refusals are legitimate. Large stores within the BottleDrop \"zones\" that pay to participate in BottleDrop don't have to accept any, or only accept 24 depending on how far.

Listed below in this article are some examples of stores required by law to accept 144 containers of any brand per person per day, and if their machines are not working or valid containers are rejected by the machines, they must hand count them. Being too busy, short on hand, or lack of space to store empties or waiting for accumulated bottles to be picked up do not excuse them from legal obligations to accept them. [20] X Trustworthy Source State of Oregon Official website for the State of Oregon Go to source [21] X Research source Compliance isn't always high, but for those whom getting cash immediately for cans is essential, this is worth keeping written down. If you're refused the opportunity to return bottles at a retailer that is required to do so, don't abuse the front clerk that's just doing what they're told. Ask to see a manager or a supervisor. Be polite and remain civil. Note what was refused and the reason given, name, date, exact time, supervisor's physical characteristics and what they were wearing (like you would for a crime suspect). Report them to OLCC with the information. By being refused directly by a supervisor and having the relevant details, it prevents the store from weaseling out with \"cart boy didn't follow instructions\" or \"hmm we have more than one John's in the store\". For now, hit another spot, and come back after OLCC has followed up with them. OLCC can impose sanctions that can impact alcohol license for violating the bottle bill, so complaint to OLCC is more effective when the violating retailer's bottom line is heavily dependent on their alcohol license. There is no legally allowed reason for refusal by container material type. It is not legal for stores to refuse containers by material type. [22] X Trustworthy Source State of Oregon Official website for the State of Oregon Go to source It is a complaint driven process and reporting it can help you make sure they're brought to compliance so you can return empties the next time you visit. Reporting a retailer not in compliance only takes a minute or two using the form on OLCC's website. Some examples of Washington County locations that must allow customers to redeem at least 144 container per individual person per calendar day. These locations are carefully verified.

Tanasbourne Village/Tanasbourne Town Center spots. This is a shopping center in unincorporated Washington county along NW 185th Ave just off the Sunset highway exit to the south. There are three large beverage selling retailers here clustered together and they're each required to process cash on the spot bottle return of 144 bottles/day/person. If you're traveling, you can hop all three stores in the shopping center and redeem 432 containers the same day without driving around much. The limit is per person, not per group or per vehicle the containers are brought in. So bring a friend along and this limit doubles.
