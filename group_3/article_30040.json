      "title": "Fold an 8 ½ in x 11 in (21.5 cm by 28 cm) piece of paper in half lengthwise.",
      "content": "Fold an 8 ½ in x 11 in (21.5 cm by 28 cm) piece of paper in half lengthwise. Using plain printer paper is best -- if you pick paper that is thicker, it will fall too easily, and if you pick thinner paper, it won't be able to gather enough momentum to really fly. After you fold the paper, run your finger along the crease to secure it."

      "title": "Unfold the piece of paper.",
      "content": "Unfold the piece of paper. Just unfold the piece of paper the same way you folded it. Make sure the crease is prominent and runs all the way down the paper."

      "title": "Fold the top two corners to create two triangles that meet at the crease.",
      "content": "Fold the top two corners to create two triangles that meet at the crease. You should create two similar right triangles with edges that meet right along the line of the crease. They should be as close to the same size as possible."

      "title": "Fold the top corner to the bottom of the folded part of the paper.",
      "content": "Fold the top corner to the bottom of the folded part of the paper. The tip of the top corner should move down to touch the bottom of the edges where the two triangles meet."

      "title": "Fold the paper in half lengthwise again.",
      "content": "Fold the paper in half lengthwise again. Fold the paper in half lengthwise just as you did in the beginning. Fold it along the same crease. You can reinforce the crease again, if you like."

    {
      "title": "Fold the wings over.",
      "content": "Fold the wings over. Once the paper is folded in half, grab one side by the outer edge of the diagonal part and fold it over toward the middle crease, so that you see a small triangle with a bottom edge that touches the middle crease. Turn the paper over and do the same on the other side. You will create a long, rectangular shape with triangles on either side of the plane. Try to make the handle .4 inches (1 cm) long at most."

      "title": "Hold the airplane by the handle and fly it.",
      "content": "Hold the airplane by the handle and fly it. Grab the airplane by the handle in the middle and gently throw it upward. You'll see that this plane creates loops instead of flying straight ahead. Keep playing with it -- experiment to see how throwing the plane faster or slower affects the movements of the plane."

If you pick paper that is thicker, it will fall too easily, and if you pick thinner paper, it won't be able to gather enough momentum to really fly. It's important to be precise when you try to fold the paper exactly in half. After you're done, run your finger along the crease to make sure that it's secure. [1] X Research source"

You'll be creating a mirror image of the top triangle over this line. You'll have a triangle with a corner that is pointing downward instead of upward."

The bottom corner of the big triangle should still be peeking below the folds created by the top two corners. Just the tips of the triangles created by the top two corners should meet an inch (2.5 cm) above the bottom corner of the big triangle below them."

Make sure that the creases on the sides of the airplane are nice and firm after you do this by running your finger along their edges."

      "content": "Fold each wing down so its bottom edges run about ½ in (1.25 cm) below the bottom edges of the plane. Fold one wing down so that it gradually slopes downward, with the thickest part of the wing being at the bottom and falling below the bottom edge of the plane. Then, fold the other wing down the same way to meet the first wing. This will make the plane as aerodynamic as it can be and can make it fly long distances and loop in the air."
