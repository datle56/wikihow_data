To do so, refer to your owner's manual under the heading \"Alarm System.\" Most cars can be re-calibrated to be less sensitive without going into the shop. There are two types of alarm sensor controls: DIP Switches: These are a series of toggles that control how much electricity runs through the sensors. Turning a few off will make your alarm system less touchy. These are built into the main control unit of the alarm system. Rheostat: Using a small screwdriver, you can loosen up a bolt that adjusts the resistance in the sensor, making it more or less sensitive. These sensors are mounted externally."
