[1] X Research source Sometimes it is easy to be honest. For example, you might be able to truthfully say, \"No, thank you, I already have a date for that party.\" Other times, you might need to find a kinder way to be nice. Maybe you are not attracted to the person. Instead of bluntly saying that, try saying, \"No, thank you, I just don't think we would be a good fit.\" Avoid making up a phony excuse. For instance, don't tell someone you will be out of town this weekend if you won't be. There's a chance that you might then run into them at the movies, which would definitely cause hurt feelings."

Try using this method when you need to reject someone. [2] X Expert Source Maria Avgitidis Matchmaker & Dating Expert Expert Interview. 20 December 2019. An example of a compliment sandwich is to say something such as, \"You're an awesome person. Unfortunately, I'm not interested in dating you. Someone else is going to be really lucky to date someone with such a great personality!\" You could also try, \"You are a really nice person. I'm only interested you as a friend. I like when we hang out in big groups together!\" Be sincere. If you offer false compliments, the other person will likely be able to tell and feel hurt. If this person continues to pursue after you've told them how you feel, you can be more direct about your lack of interest and set boundaries around your time together.
