[2] X Research source How yellow your teeth are is a good indication of how thin your enamel is; the less enamel you have, the more yellow your teeth will be.

      "content": "Look for a change in shape. Another way in which your teeth physically change when enamel loss occurs is a change in shape. Your teeth may appear to be rounded and short. When you lose enamel your teeth may take on a rounded shape and can also cause your teeth to look shorter than normal. If you have a tooth filling, you may notice that your tooth seems to have shrunk around the filling. This shrinkage is caused by the loss of tooth enamel."

      "content": "Check your teeth for cavities. Enamel loss makes your teeth brittle and prone to cavities. This is because enamel protects your teeth from plaque and debris buildup.

This can cause extreme pain and in some cases, infection due to bacteria that has an easier access through the porous structure of dentin."
