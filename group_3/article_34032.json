      "content": "Consider the risks of surgery. All surgical procedures carry some risks, even those that are done in a physician’s office or an outpatient surgical center. Swelling and bruising are common following this type of surgery. In some rare cases, bleeding may be prolonged. An additional procedure may be needed to stop the bleeding. Infections are unlikely but possible, and can be treated with the use of antibiotics. Scarring of the skin tissue at the site of the surgery is possible."

      "content": "Ask your doctor to explain your options. Circumcision, or other procedures specific to your condition, may correct the problem for penile conditions. One study showed that 15% to 20% of men that were advised to have a circumcision, and chose to have the frenuloplasty procedure performed, went on to have circumcision done later. The average time to circumcision was 11 months following the initial procedure. [2] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source"

Even just a few days prior to the surgery can have a positive impact on your recovery. The sooner you quit before the procedure, the better the outcomes. Smoking interferes with your body’s ability to heal."

      "content": "Talk to your doctor about anesthesia. Many surgeons prefer to perform this type of surgery with the person under general anesthesia. [4] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source General anesthesia means you will be asleep during the operation. A spinal block, which is an injection that goes into your back and numbs you from about your waist and below, is also sometimes used. [5] X Trustworthy Source MedlinePlus Collection of medical information sourced from the US National Library of Medicine Go to source A penile block is sometimes used, although it is not a common way to provide anesthesia for this procedure. A penile block is an injection that numbs only your penis. IV sedation is another option. IV sedation is a type of anesthesia that puts you into a \"twilight\" state. It uses medications that are not as strong as drugs used for general anesthesia, so you will not be as deeply asleep."

Since general anesthesia is used in most cases, specific instructions will be provided that you must follow before reporting for your surgery. [6] X Research source Common guidelines recommended for people that will be going under general anesthesia include the need to avoid eating or drinking anything, including water and chewing gum, for a predetermined time before your surgery. This step is usually advised to begin at midnight, the night before your surgery."

Some surgeons prefer that certain types of soaps be used prior to surgery. One example is a skin cleanser called chlorhexidine that helps to clean the skin more thoroughly than regular soap to avoid infections. Your doctor will advise you as to the appropriate products to use in your bath or shower, as well as the time you should do so."

The most common problems that develop from oral frenuloplasty occur very rarely, but include the following: Excessive bleeding Infection at the surgical site Damage to the tongue Damage to the salivary glands Scarring of tissue at the surgical site Possible allergic reactions to the anesthesia drugs used Reattachment of the corrected frenulum after the surgery, causing recurrence of the original problem"

When the frenulum is short and thick, and tethers the tip of te tongue to the floor of the mouth, the only option is to proceed with surgery to allow the tongue to move in a normal manner. The condition interferes with the infant or child’s ability to eat, suck from a bottle or breast, speak normally, swallow, as well as causing problems with normal tooth and gum development. Other problems may include difficulty with maintaining good oral hygiene, any activity that involves using the tongue like licking a cone of ice cream or licking the lips, and playing some types of musical instruments.

Your surgeon will advise you regarding the safest form of anesthesia to use in your child. Both general anesthesia and IV sedation have specific instructions that must be followed beginning at least eight hours before the procedure, and often start the night before. Follow the instructions provided by your doctor. The main directions will be regarding restrictions of both food and water for a specified number of hours before the procedure, usually beginning at midnight on the night before the procedure is scheduled.

The actual surgery time is between 15 to 45 minutes in most cases of penile frenuloplasty, and usually less than 15 minutes for oral frenuloplasty."
