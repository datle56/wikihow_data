      "title": "Choose your outfits and complementary accessories.",
      "content": "Choose your outfits and complementary accessories. To avoid throwing a bunch of jewelry that you won’t wind up wearing into your bag, it helps to coordinate the pieces with the clothing that you’ll be wearing. Put together the outfits that you plan to bring on your trip, and then choose only the jewelry items that complement those clothes. When it comes to jewelry that you wear daily, such as a watch or rings, settle on just one set to avoid overpacking. It helps to choose a single metal for the jewelry that you’ll bring, so you don't need to bring gold and silver versions of staple items, such as your watch."

      "title": "Limit the number of pieces that you bring.",
      "content": "Limit the number of pieces that you bring. To avoid losing your jewelry, it helps to bring a small number of items so you can keep track of all of them. Stick to a few versatile pieces, such as some stud earrings, a small pendant, and a simple bracelet. You may want to throw in a couple of statement pieces if you’re attending a special event or plan to dress up on occasion, though. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Choose less expensive or meaningful items to bring.",
      "content": "Choose less expensive or meaningful items to bring. If you’re worried you might lose items, it only makes sense to pack items that you wouldn’t be as upset to lose. Very expensive items or items with sentimental value, such as a family heirloom, are best left at home, so you don’t have to worry about keeping track of them. [2] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Take photos of what you’re bringing.",
      "content": "Take photos of what you’re bringing. After you’ve decided what jewelry to bring, lay it out so you can take photos of all the pieces that you’re bringing. You can look at the photos when you’re getting dressed on your trip, so you don’t have to take out all of your jewelry to know which pieces to wear. It also helps you to keep track of the items you brought to avoid leaving any behind when you head home."

    {
      "title": "Invest in a good jewelry case or roll.",
      "content": "Invest in a good jewelry case or roll. Having a dedicated bag for your jewelry makes packing for trips much easier. You can opt for a case style with a hard exterior if you’re concerned about damage or a soft roll style organizer that allows you to maximize space in your luggage. Jewelry organizers usually have compartments to separate your items so you don’t have to worry about items getting tangled together. You can use a bag that you already have as a jewelry organizer for your trip, such as an extra toiletry bag. However, because it won’t have jewelry-specific compartments, you’ll need to use other items to organize your pieces inside the bag."

      "title": "Roll necklaces up in a microfiber cloth.",
      "content": "Roll necklaces up in a microfiber cloth. The cloth is soft enough that it won’t scratch the jewelry, but rolling the necklaces up in it keeps them from getting tangled. Lay the cloth out, and set the necklaces on top of it in rows that are 2 inches (5.1 cm) to 3 inches (7.6 cm) apart. Begin at one end of the cloth, and start rolling it up over the necklaces, making sure that no 2 are touching one another. Roll the cloth all the way to the end, and then fold the ends together to tuck into your bag. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Thread thin necklaces through straws to prevent tangling. Gather a straw for each delicate necklace that you’re bringing, and carefully pull them through the straw. Fasten the necklace’s clasp to secure it in place, and set it inside your bag. Depending on the length of the necklace, you may need to trim the straws down to size with a pair of scissors. You can use the straws for any necklaces that are thin enough to thread through them. For a chunkier necklace, you can use empty paper towel rolls."

      "title": "Store small jewelry items in a pill organizer.",
      "content": "Store small jewelry items in a pill organizer. Pill organizers are broken down into small compartments, which makes them ideal for packing earrings, rings, and even delicate necklaces. You can pack multiple pairs of stud earrings or rings in the compartments if they're large enough, but it's best to only place one pair of dangling earrings or a single necklace in each compartment to avoid tangling.

      "title": "Use small plastic bags for earrings, bracelets, and chunky necklaces.",
      "content": "Use small plastic bags for earrings, bracelets, and chunky necklaces. Plastic storage bags come in a variety of sizes, so you can choose several options that match the size of your pieces. Several pairs of stud earrings can fit together in one bag, but place dangling earrings, bracelets, and necklaces in their own bags to prevent them from tangling."

      "title": "Organize earrings with buttons.",
      "content": "Organize earrings with buttons. Because they have holes in the center, spare buttons that come with clothing are an ideal way to organize earrings for travel. Place the earrings through the holes and fasten them closed to keep them together, so you don’t lose any. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Keep expensive or meaningful jewelry in carry-on bags.",
      "content": "Keep expensive or meaningful jewelry in carry-on bags. If you’re traveling by plane, you’re always better off packing your jewelry in a carry-on bag. However, if you’re bringing items that are costly or have great meaning, it’s even more important to keep them in your carry-on luggage. Carry-on bags are much less likely to get lost, so you don’t have to worry about an heirloom necklace going missing. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Avoid placing the jewelry in outer pockets or compartments. Those spots are more likely to get banged and dinged when you carry your bag or suitcase around, which can damage your jewelry. Place your jewelry roll or other container in the interior compartment of the bag to keep it safe."

      "title": "Surround the jewelry with soft clothing.",
      "content": "Surround the jewelry with soft clothing. The best spot for your jewelry in your bag's interior is right in the center. Place rolled up clothing around the roll or case to serve as a cushion. If your bag is dropped or banged around, the clothing will lessen the impact to prevent damage to your jewelry."
