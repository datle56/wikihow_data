Search online or watch a few cheerleading videos to get an idea of the basics. For example; Rebound – an athlete uses the force of the landing of one tumbling skill to spring themselves straight up into a hollow position. This is used more often as a drill rather than a skill in itself[Image:Make the Middle School Cheer Squad Step 1.jpg|center]] Tumbling refers to gymnastic moves performed on the floor, such as round-offs or back handsprings. Stunting refers to the way a team builds their tricks, such as in pyramids or basket tosses. The backspot and bases are the people holding up the flyer, who does tricks in the air. Jumps have different names depending on how to do them. A toe touch is a jump in which you jump up and spread your legs in the air, like a split, while touching your toes; a herkie is a jump in which one leg is stretched out in front of you while the other is bent at the knee and faces behind you. Remember to always point your toes!"

If you spend a bit of time learning the basics, such as a high V, low V, daggers, T, and broken T, you’ll have an edge when it comes time to try out. Remember to keep your motions stiff. Make sure your arms are straight and your muscles are tense. Keep your joints (elbows, wrists) stiff and straight unless the motion requires them to be bent. For most motions, your arms should be slightly in front of you. Tighten your fists, and be sure to keep your thumbs on the outside of your fingers, not tucked in. Never show your palms."
