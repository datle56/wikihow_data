Plus, you’ll have more time to decide what you need to bring and what you can leave at home.

Bring refills of any prescription medicines that you won’t be able to replace while you’re traveling. Check that your wallet has your driver’s license or other IDs, bank cards, and local currency. While optional, it may be helpful to include a paper with your emergency contacts’ information and trip details, backup credit or debit cards, and a photocopy of your passport and visa in case you misplace these items or they’re stolen. If your allergies occasionally flair up or you tend to get migraines, make sure you pack appropriate over-the-counter medications."

When deciding which clothes to take, prioritize neutrals to make a capsule wardrobe, advises experienced solo traveler Archana Ramamoorthy, MS. Pick clothes in neutral colors like black, white, beige, and gray so you can easily pair different tops and bottoms together. It’s fine to include one or two patterned or dressy items, but consider what will be most re-wearable during your trip. Look for fabrics that are anti-wrinkle, such as wool, polyester, knitwear, and spandex, so you can pack them tightly and not worry about steaming or ironing. [3] X Research source"

Luxury travel specialist Angela Rice agrees that accessories like jewelry and hats help make your outfits feel different, even when you’re re-wearing the same clothing. If the culture of the country you're visiting is on the conservative side, a lightweight scarf won’t add bulk to your luggage but can easily and quickly cover you up. Men can wear ties , stylish glasses , or a watch to dress up their everyday duds. These items hardly add any weight and don’t take up much room in your suitcase."

Check the airline website for weight and bag size requirements so you can measure and weigh your bag before going to the airport. [4] X Trustworthy Source U.S. Transportation Security Administration U.S. government agency responsible for ensuring safety by setting and enforcing travel protocols Go to source When you do reach your destination, you’ll enjoy mobility and spontaneity by not having heavy luggage. If there are some items you need access to regularly, these should be placed at the top of your bag or in the outside pockets. This will prevent you from needing to dig through all of your belongings. Carrying your bag onto the plane means it’s less likely to be lost, broken, or stolen. You’ll save on checked bag fees. Similarly, last minute changes in your flight itinerary will be met with less stress because your things are with you."

      "content": "If you’ll have laundry access, pack fewer clothes to save space. Plan to bring three pairs of socks, underwear, and shirts. This way you’ll have just enough of each item to wash one, dry one, and wear one. Pants can usually be worn more than once, so two pairs should suffice (one long, one short). This rule only applies to the staples that you’ll be wearing everyday. If you plan to attend an event where your standard ensemble won’t be appropriate, plan accordingly. [5] X Research source If you only want to bring one pair of shoes, make sure they’re comfortable to walk in."

      "content": "Roll your clothes to pack more efficiently . Roll your clothes instead of folding them to maximize space in your suitcase and minimize wrinkles. Rolling shirts, socks, underwear, and pairs of pants makes it easier to cram them into every free nook and cranny of your bag. The rolling technique doesn’t cause any more wrinkles than folding. [6] X Research source To roll shirts, fold them in half and place the sleeves onto the body. Begin rolling from the hem up. To roll pants, fold them in half with the back pockets touching. Roll from either end, making sure not to form any creases. Place small rolled items like underwear, socks, and shirts inside your shoes to save more space."

This saves room by eliminating the air between clothing. If you don’t have one, Ramamoorthy recommends placing your clothing rolls in gallon-size Ziploc baggies and pressing out the air before sealing them."

If it’s too hot to comfortably wear a jacket or coat on the plane or other transportation, place it on your lap like a blanket, suggests personal stylist Sarah McDonald. If you’re only bringing one or two pairs of shoes, wear your more comfortable pair while traveling to free up additional space in your bag. Layer shirts or sweaters if you’re really tight on space—as long as you won’t get overheated while traveling."

      "content": "Check the forecast to see if you can leave rain gear at home. Unless you’re going somewhere that has exceptionally rainy weather, such as the Pacific Northwest, the forecast during your two-week stay should let you know if it’s worth it to bring boots, raincoats, and umbrellas. Consider the time of year and season at your destination before packing, advises Rice. Consider packing a travel-size umbrella if you anticipate rain. They don’t take up much space and can come in handy during a light shower. If the forecast is wrong and it does start to rain, you’ll most likely be able to buy a disposable poncho at your destination."
