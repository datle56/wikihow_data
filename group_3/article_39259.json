      "title": "Empty the dust receptacle.",
      "content": "Empty the dust receptacle. Check to see if the dust bin or dust cup is full, then clear it out. Also, check any openings in the dust receptacle to make sure they’re not blocked by dirt, hair, or other debris. If there’s a screen inside the dust receptacle, clear it of any debris as well. [1] X Research source If debris builds up in the dust bin or dust cup all the way to the “MAX FILL” line, you’ll usually notice a loss of suction in your Shark vacuum. Also, dirt and debris can block the openings on the dust bin or dust cup, which could prevent the vacuum from cleaning properly. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Clear any blockages in the brush roller.",
      "content": "Clear any blockages in the brush roller. Turn over the vacuum and look at the brush roller (sometimes called the beater bar). Pull any hair, fibers, dust, or objects away from the brush, then test it to make sure it spins freely. If you need to, use scissors to carefully snip the obstruction from the brush roller. Also, use your fingers to clear any obstructions out of the nozzle openings. [3] X Research source If your vacuum has additional brushes—like a Shark robot with a side brush—check these as well. [4] X Research source Hair or fibers wrapped around the brushes could keep them from turning. There could also be debris buildup or even a small item trapped near the brush, which can stop its rotation. [5] X Research source Deep clean: On some Shark vacuums, you may be able to remove a cover from the brush head, allowing you to check for debris buildup. Check your owner’s manual to learn exactly how to do this on your model. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Clean or replace the air filters.",
      "content": "Clean or replace the air filters. Take out each filter and inspect it—if it’s dirty or clogged with hair or other debris, that could be why your Shark vacuum isn’t sucking. [7] X Research source If your air filter is disposable, replace it with a new one. If your air filter is reusable, rinse it until the water runs clear. Allow the filter to dry for at least 24 hours, then replace it. Refer to your owner’s manual to see where the air filters are located in your Shark vacuum—there may be one or you might have more than one. Quick tip: If you’re in a hurry or don’t have a replacement filter, you may be able to clear out the filter by tapping it against the inside of your garbage can. (This will produce a lot of dust, so you might want to do it outside.) But this is only a temporary fix, so change or clean the filter as soon as you can."

      "title": "Remove any clogs in the hose or wand.",
      "content": "Remove any clogs in the hose or wand. Drop a coin down the wand or hose on your Shark vacuum—if the coin doesn’t come out the other side, there’s probably a blockage. If you have a hose vacuum, you may be able to feel the blockage by running your fingers along the hose. Squeeze the hose to carefully work the blockage toward one end so you can reach in and remove it. [8] X Research source If that doesn’t work, or if you have a wand vacuum, push a rounded stick (like a broom handle) into one end of the hose to push the blockage out the other side, being careful not to damage the vacuum."

    {
      "title": "Use a high-power setting.",
      "content": "Use a high-power setting. If your Shark vacuum has an energy-friendly setting (Eco Mode), it may use lower power as a way to reduce the vacuum’s electrical pull. Use a different setting to see if the suction improves. For instance, try Boost Mode or Max Mode instead of Eco Mode. [9] X Research source Note that if you’re trying to vacuum deep carpet, the suction could be reduced if you’re inadvertently using a setting meant for hard floors or low carpet. [10] X Research source If your Shark vacuum has an adjustable height, try lowering it—this will concentrate the vacuum’s power to a smaller area, which may help increase the suction."

    {
      "title": "Make sure the vacuum has power.",
      "content": "Make sure the vacuum has power. Your Shark vacuum won’t work properly if it isn’t getting power. If you have a corded model, make sure it’s plugged in, or move the plug to another outlet if that one isn’t working. If you have a battery-powered model, be sure the battery is charged. If it’s still not working, the problem could be with the power cord, battery, or motor. If you suspect an issue with the unit’s power supply or motor, visit Shark’s support site for troubleshooting tips or to reach out to their customer service team. Safety tip: Do not attempt to repair a faulty power cord on your own, and don’t disassemble the Shark vacuum to try to fix the motor—you’ll run the risk of an electric shock, and you could void your warranty. Did your Shark vac overheat? If your vacuum was working normally then suddenly shut off and won’t come back on, it may have overheated. Wait about an hour for it to cool down, then try to turn the vacuum on again. [11] X Research source"

      "title": "Look for leaks or cracks in the hose or frame.",
      "content": "Look for leaks or cracks in the hose or frame. If you find a broken hose or cracks in the body of the vacuum, contact Shark customer service to determine whether the hose or frame can be repaired on your model. If it can’t be fixed, they may send you a new vacuum if yours is still under warranty. [12] X Research source Over time, your Shark vacuum can develop cracks or breaks in the hose. If the unit is dropped, the frame could crack as well. Cracks in the vacuum will prevent it from sucking properly."

      "content": "Where is the reset button on a Shark vacuum? Check your owner’s manual to see if your model has a reset button. Many upright, handheld, and stick vacuum models don’t have one. However, you can reboot some Shark robot vacuums by pressing and holding the DOCK or POWER button for 10–15 seconds. [13] X Research source"

      "content": "Why is my Shark vacuum making a loud noise? If your Shark vacuum is making a loud noise, turn off the vacuum and unplug it, then check around the brush roller for any obstructions. Empty the dust bin and clean the filters, as well. [14] X Research source If you still hear the noise after thoroughly cleaning the vacuum, there may be an issue with the motor or belt—contact Shark customer service for assistance."

      "title": "Why is there a burning smell coming from my Shark vacuum?",
      "content": "Why is there a burning smell coming from my Shark vacuum? If your vacuum is brand-new, you may notice a strange smell coming from the motor the first few times you use it. If you’ve used the vacuum for a while, check for clogs that could be causing the vacuum to overheat. If that’s not the problem, check any connection points for melting or damage, like where the hose or wand meets the vacuum and where the dust receptacle connects to the housing. [15] X Research source If you see melted plastic or burns on the metallic connectors, stop using the vacuum and contact Shark customer service."

      "content": "Why is my Shark vacuum overheating? Clogs can cause your Shark vacuum to overheat. Empty the dust receptacle and clean the filters, then check the hose and brush roller to make sure they’re not blocked. You may need to wait 1 hour for the vacuum to cool down before it will come on again. [16] X Research source If your vacuum keeps overheating, there could be a problem with the motor."

      "title": "Empty the dustbin as soon as it’s full.",
      "content": "Empty the dustbin as soon as it’s full. Keep an eye on the dust receptacle on your Shark vacuum, and empty it as soon as debris reaches the MAX FILL line. Every time you empty the bin, check the inside of the container and the openings on the vacuum for hair, dust, or other clogs."

      "title": "Rinse or replace the filters about once a month.",
      "content": "Rinse or replace the filters about once a month. Remove the air filters from your vacuum. If they’re reusable, rinse them in the sink until the water runs clear. If they’re disposable, replace them with a new one. Check your owner’s manual if you’re not sure how many filters your vacuum has or where to find them. If you have pets that shed a lot, or if you have allergies, you may need to clean your filters more often, like once every 2 or 3 weeks. For a quick clean, remove the filters and tap them inside of your trash can to clear out dirt. It’s a good idea to do this each time you empty the dust receptacle."

      "title": "Clean the brushes and vacuum housing as needed.",
      "content": "Clean the brushes and vacuum housing as needed. You may not need to clean your brush roller every time you vacuum, but it’s a good idea to check it each time. If hair, dust, or other debris becomes wrapped around the roller, your vacuum won’t operate properly. If the outside of your vacuum cleaner gets dusty or dirty, wipe it down with a lightly damp (not wet) cloth and allow it to air dry."
