[1] X Trustworthy Source Royal Horticultural Society Leading gardening charity in the U.K. providing resources for identifying, growing and caring for flowers and other plants Go to source Look for plums that are deep purple and slightly soft to the touch. If the plum is still rock-hard, it isn’t ripe yet. [2] X Trustworthy Source Royal Horticultural Society Leading gardening charity in the U.K. providing resources for identifying, growing and caring for flowers and other plants Go to source If you want to ripen a plum faster, leave it on the counter next to a banana. The banana produces ethylene, which will speed up the plum’s ripening process."

You can try to germinate the plum pits without removing the seeds first, but most people have better success when they dry out the pits and harvest the seeds."

Then, place the seeds on the bottom half and fold the top half over so they’re completely covered. [8] X Research source Using a paper towel to germinate the seeds often produces results much faster than other methods. Instead of waiting a full 12 weeks for roots to sprout, you may start seeing growth after 2 weeks. As an alternative to paper towels, plant specialist Rachel Guffey also recommends “wrapping the seeds in damp sphagnum moss and putting them into an empty strawberry container” or plastic bag “for germination.” Damp sand works, too.

[11] X Research source Keeping the seeds in the fridge mimics the process that would take place if the plum were to have fallen to the ground after the summer growing season ended. The plum would break open, and the pit would spend several months in the cold winter earth. This process is called stratification and is necessary for the seeds to sprout roots. So, Guffey says the seeds need cold stratification to germinate indoors."

[13] X Research source Even after the seeds start to root, you can leave them in the fridge. They won’t be ready to be planted in soil or go outside until the springtime.
