      "content": "Choose the freshest lemons you can find; hand pick, if possible. Some people are lucky enough to have lemon trees in their yards, or live next to someone who does. Sometimes lemon trees and shrubs have sharp spiky thorns, so wear protective clothing and gloves. [5] X Research source If you have a very tall tree, use a lemon picker. Or, better yet, grab a friend and get two lemon pickers (or more)."

      "content": "Sort the lemons into two groups, and then wash and dry them. One group is those with only superficial blemishes on the skin and the second group is those with deeper bruises or blemishes. [6] X Research source This is an important step if you have a large supply of hand-picked lemons. Separate them into two bags, or bowls. If you have help, have one person wash one group while you wash another, discarding any lemons that appear moldy or infected. Pat the lemons dry or let them air dry in an area with good air circulation, because they can start to rot if they sit in water too long."

[8] X Research source The \"cut into lemons\" will need to be used first for your project, or stored in the refrigerator until you use them. [9] X Research source Blemishes are not always terrible, but if you are going to be making something like jelly and or sugared lemon, you'd probably not want to eat an unsightly dark spot on a piece of lemon, so it's best to just dispose of them. If you want, juice the cut lemons right away. See Making and Freezing Lemon Juice, below."
