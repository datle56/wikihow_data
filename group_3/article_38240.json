It's best to understand them. \"O-\" This prefix indicates respect. On other forms of sister, it's optional, but if you dropped it from \"oneesama,\" because... \"-sama\" is the most respectful honorific in mainstream Japanese. It emphasizes that the speaker is lower in status than the person they're talking about. In Japanese-to-English translations, this is often translated as \"Lord,\" \"Lady,\" or \"Sir.\" (It is used for either gender.) Dropping \"o-\" while using \"-sama\" would be something like saying \"his Highness, the illustrious buddy of mine.\" \"Ne\" or \"nee\" can be found in every Japanese word for \"elder sister.\""

Again, you need to keep a pure \"e\" sound. Don't let it blur into a \"y\" sound. Note that \"nee\" is actually made up of two syllables. This is a difficult thing to pronounce for an English speaker; try clapping for each syllable while saying them slowly to get a sense of it."
