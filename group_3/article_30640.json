      "content": "Define the equation to solve for surface tension. In this experiment, the equation for surface tension will be determined by the equation F = 2sd . F is the force in newtons (N), s is the surface tension in (N/m), and d is the length of the needle used in the experiment. Rearranging the equation to solve for surface tension yields s = F/2d . [3] X Research source The force will be calculated at the end of the experiment. Measure the length of the needle in meters using a ruler before starting the experiment."

      "content": "Construct a small balance beam. [4] X Trustworthy Source Science Buddies Expert-sourced database of science projects, explanations, and educational material Go to source In this experiment, you will use a balance beam and a small needle floating on the surface of water to measure surface tension. The balance beam needs to be well constructed so that you can get an accurate result. You can use many different types of materials for this, just make sure the center beam is something sturdy like wood, plastic, or dense cardboard. Mark the center of the material to be used for your beam (straw, plastic ruler) and drill or poke a hole through it; this will be the fulcrum point (the point that allows the beam to rotate freely). If you are using a plastic straw you can just poke a pin or nail right through it. Drill or poke a hole at each end of the beam ensuring that they are the same distance from the middle. Thread a string through each hole to serve as holders for the balance dishes. Make sure that there is 1 string for each hole at either end. Rest the nail horizontally between two stacks of books so that the center beam can rotate freely."

The dish will be filled with water or another weight, so make sure it is sturdy enough to support this. Hang the box or dish from one end of the beam.

On the opposite side of the beam, tie a paper clip or needle to the end of the string so that it lays flat. For the experiment to work, it is important that the paper clip or needle is horizontal."

      "content": "Place a piece of material such as clay or play-doh on the beam to counterbalance the aluminum container. Before beginning the experiment, you want to make sure that the beam is lying flat. The dish will be heavier than the needle, causing the beam to lower in the direction of the dish. Add enough clay to the opposite side of the beam so that the beam is level. This is called counterbalancing. The clay does not affect the calculations because it is balancing out the beam."

      "content": "Place the needle or paper clip hanging from the beam into a container of water. This step may require some extra effort to ensure the needle is resting just on the top of the water’s surface. You do not want the needle submerged in the water. Fill a container with water (or other liquid of unknown surface tension) and place it underneath the needle at a height that allows the needle to rest directly on top the surface. Make sure the string holding the needle in place remains taut once the needle is on top of the water."

You will be adding pins or drops of water one at a time to the aluminum dish you constructed earlier. For the calculation, it is important to know exactly how much weight is required to lift the needle out of the water. Count out a number of pins or drops of water and weigh them. Determine the individual weight of each drop or pin by dividing the total weight by the number of pins or water drops. For example, let’s say 30 pins weigh 15 grams: 15/30 = 0.5. Each pin weighs 0.5 grams."

Slowly add a pin or a drop of water to the aluminum dish one pin/drop at a time. Watch the needle closely to see if it comes out of the water with each new addition. Stop adding pins/drops once the needle is no longer in contact with the surface of the water. Count the number of pins or drops of water needed to remove the counterweight from the water's surface. Record each reading. Repeat the exercise several times (5 or 6) for more accurate readings. Calculate an average of the results by adding the total number of pins needed in each trial and dividing that by the total number of trials."

To calculate the surface tension, you need to know the total amount of force required to remove the needle from the surface of the liquid.

[5] X Trustworthy Source Science Buddies Expert-sourced database of science projects, explanations, and educational material Go to source Multiply the number of pins added to the dish by the weight of each pin. For example, 5 pins at 0.5 g/pin = 5 x 0.5 = 2.5 g. Multiply the amount of grams by the conversion factor 0.00981 N/g: 2.5 x 0.00981 = 0.025 N."

      "title": "Understand capillary action.",
      "content": "Understand capillary action. In order to understand capillary action, you first need to understand adhesion and cohesive forces. Adhesion is the force that causes a liquid to stick to a solid surface, such as the edge of a glass. Cohesive forces are those that pull liquid molecules toward each other. [6] X Research source The combination of adhesion and cohesive forces causes a liquid to rise up the center of a thin tube. The height the liquid rises can be used to calculate the surface tension of that liquid. Cohesion causes water to form bubbles or droplets on a surface. When a liquid is in contact with air, the molecules feel attractive forces towards each other and make a bubble on the surface. Adhesion causes the meniscus that is seen in liquids when they cling to the sides of a glass. It is the concave shape at the top of the liquid seen at eye level. [7] X Research source An example of capillary action is watching water rise in a straw placed in a cup of water."

      "title": "Define the equation to solve for surface tension.",
      "content": "Define the equation to solve for surface tension. Surface tension is given by the equation S = (ρhga/2) where S is the surface tension, ρ (or rho) is the density of the liquid you are measuring, h is the height the liquid rises in the tube, g is the acceleration due to gravity acting on the liquid (9.8 m/s 2 ) and a is the radius of the capillary tube. [8] X Research source When working through this equation, make sure all of your units are in the proper metric form: density in kg/m 3 , height and radius in meters, and gravity in m/s 2 . If the density of the liquid is not given, you can look it up in a reference book or calculate it using the equation density = mass/volume. The unit for surface tension is one newton per meter (N/m). A Newton is equal to 1 kg-m/s 2 . To work out the units on your own, simply solve the equation with just units. S = kg/m 3 * m * m/s 2 * m. Two of the meter units cancel out two of the per meter units and you are left with 1 kg-m/s 2 /m or 1 N/m."

The amount of liquid added does not matter as long as you can clearly see the rise in liquid within the capillary tube.

Alternatively, just use separate dishes for each liquid."

      "content": "Place a clear, thin tube into the liquid. This is the tube that you will take your measurements from to calculate the surface tension. The tube must be clear so that you can see how far the liquid rises above the level in the dish. The tube must also have the same radius throughout. [10] X Research source To measure the radius, simply place a ruler across the top of the tube and determine the diameter. Divide the diameter by 2 and you have the radius. You can buy these tubes online or from a hardware store. It can be difficult to accurately measure small changes in the height the liquid will rise in a straw or wide tube. As the height to which the water will rise is inversely proportional to the diameter of the tube (narrower tube = higher rise) this experiment is much easier to do with a narrow transparent capillary tube. These can be purchased at low cost online, but confirm the inside diameter is provided (typically around 1mm-1.2mm) and both ends are open. As these are fragile and made of glass, ensure care when handling them."

Water has a density around 1000 kg/m 3 (we will use approximate values in this example). [12] X Research source The variable g is always 9.8 m/s 2 . The radius of the tube is .029 m and the water rises 0.0005 m. What is the surface tension of the water? Plugging the variables into the equation yields: S = (ρhga/2) = (1000 x 9.8 x 0.029 x 0.0005)/2 = 0.1421/2 = 0.071 J/m 2 ."
