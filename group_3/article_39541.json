      "content": "Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Fill a large pot of water 3/4 of the way full and place it on the stove. The pot should be large enough to submerge the waist portion of your jeans. Set the heat on high and cover the pot with a lid to reduce the time it takes for the water to reach a boil."

      "content": "Submerge the waistband in boiling water. Carefully dip only the waistband of your jeans into the boiling water. Make sure you do this very slowly to minimize splashing. The water is very hot and could cause a serious burn! Only the waistband of the jeans should be submerged in the water to avoid shrinking the whole pair of jeans. Wear oven mitts to protect against burns. If you are boiling water on a gas stove, make sure to keep the jeans away from the open flame. You want to shrink your jeans not set them on fire!"

      "content": "Reduce the heat and simmer for 20 to 30 minutes. Allow the rest of the jeans to drape over the side of the pot onto a nearby counter while the waistband soaks in the simmering water. Make sure you don't let the jeans come in contact with the stove burner. [1] X Research source If there is no safe place to rest the legs of the jeans, replace the pot lid and gently fold the legs over the top of the partially closed lid. Allow the legs to drape in a pile on top of the lid, leaving the waistband in the hot water. You can also pour the boiling water into a bucket and allow your jeans to soak away from the stove."

      "title": "Remove your jeans from the water and wrap them in a towel.",
      "content": "Remove your jeans from the water and wrap them in a towel. Carefully use a pair of tongs to avoid touching the scalding water as you remove your jeans. Lay the waistband flat on top of a towel. Position the towel so that it can be folded over the jeans, like a sandwich. With the jeans resting between two layers of towel, begin pressing to remove excess water until your jeans are no longer dripping wet. The excess water will be hot, so you may need to wear your oven mitts. You can also try rolling the jeans and towel lengthwise into a log to squeeze out extra water."

      "content": "Fill your bathtub with hot water. Because hot water is necessary to cause the denim to shrink, you should adjust the temperature as high as is comfortable.

You'll need to sit in the tub for at least 20 minutes. [4] X Research source Plan ahead by setting up a speaker so that you can listen to music or a podcast while you soak. Or, stash some reading material near the tub if you prefer."

      "content": "Towel-dry yourself after getting out of the tub. Because your jeans will be quite wet, you'll need to remove some of the excess water as soon as you get out of the tub. Wrap a towel around the lower half of your body and move it up and down the length of your jeans using a patting motion. If you are wearing a pair of jeans with a dark wash, you may want to consider using a dark colored towel to avoid any stains that might occur from the dye that is released from your jeans. [5] X Research source It is normal for some dye to leach out into the tub water. Don't worry, this should not stain your tub. After you drain the bath, rinse the tub thoroughly and wipe it clean."

      "content": "Allow your jeans to dry while you are wearing them. Do not take off your wet jeans. Instead, keep them on while you are hanging out around your house. As the jeans dry they will contract, conforming to the shape of your body. If you are too uncomfortable in your wet jeans, you can remove them and allow them to partially dry. If you remove your wet jeans, make sure to put them back on before they dry completely in order for the jeans to adjust perfectly to your shape as they finish drying. Avoid sitting on light colored furniture while wearing your wet jeans as the denim dye might rub off. Keep in mind that your jeans might shrink slightly overall if the entire jean is exposed to hot water.

Rather, they will have a perfectly form-fitted appearance after they dry."
