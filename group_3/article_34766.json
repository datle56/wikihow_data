      "content": "Pour baking soda over the embers and firewood. Use any kind of store-bought baking soda; you just want enough of it to create a thin layer over the embers and wood. Baking soda contains sodium bicarbonate, which is also found in some fire extinguishers, and it will help smother the fire so it doesn't restart. [5] X Research source Avoid using sand to smother a fire as it will be difficult to clean out of the fireplace."

It's OK to leave the ashes unattended while you sleep, as long as the fire is completely out (there are no flames or red embers). [7] X Research source"
