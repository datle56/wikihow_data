      "content": "Weigh or estimate the weight of what you're sending. For light envelopes, you may not need to use a USPS flat rate envelope, but for a 20 pound (9 kg) box, a flat rate product is usually the better option. Judge roughly how heavy your mail is to decide if you should use a flat rate product. [1] X Research source If you have a small home scale, use it to weigh the package so you can estimate the cost with the price calculator. If you are sending a heavy object or mailing over a long distance, a flat rate box may be cheaper than using your own supplies."

      "title": "Check the priority mail guidelines.",
      "content": "Check the priority mail guidelines. To ship something in priority mail, the package must weight less than 70 pounds (31.75 kg). Also, make sure the package totals less than 108 inches (270 cm) (2.7 m) when you add the length measurement to the measurement of the thickest part of the package. [2] X Research source For example, if the length is 60 inches (150 cm) (1.5 m) and the thickest part of the package is 50 inches (130 cm) (1.27 m), it would be too big based on the priority mail guidelines."

      "content": "Request priority shipping at the post office. When you get to the post office to send your mail, it’s important to tell the worker that you want to ship priority. Otherwise, they will apply regular shipping standards and your mail may get to where it’s going slower than you want it to. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Choose between a box or an envelope.",
      "content": "Choose between a box or an envelope. If you are mailing paper or other flat objects, look for an envelope that fits your need. Go with a box for larger, non-flat objects like a mug or a candle. Browse the sizes of boxes to see which you’d need for the object you want to mail. [5] X Research source The main benefit of flat rate products is the ease of shipping. Whatever fits in the product can be shipped, as long as it’s under 70 pounds (31.75 kg). Envelopes aren’t only for flat stuff like paper, but they are mainly designed for thin objects. Flat rate products must be picked up at the post office or ordered online through some third party distributors or the USPS website. Pick them up for free and pay when you ship."

Try out the three box sizes to find the one that fits your mail best. [6] X Research source Each size box costs a specific amount, so you don’t want to pick a bigger box than you need because you’ll spend extra money for no reason. Flat rate box sizes by outside measurements in inches are small (8 11/16x5 7/16x1 3/4), medium top-loading (11 1/4x8 3/4x 6), medium side-loading (14x12x3 1/2), and large (12 1/4x12 1/4x 6)."
