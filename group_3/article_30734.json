      "content": "Medium ugly describes someone who isn’t conventionally attractive. If someone calls another person (usually a man) “medium ugly,” it means they might not meet traditional beauty standards, but they have a charm or quality that makes them attractive to a specific person. [1] X Research source For example, TikTok user @ohmontaine made a video where he said, “Nothing is more attractive to a hot lady than a medium ugly guy who makes her laugh like crazy.” Because the term was popularized on TikTok and X, people who use “medium ugly” typically belong to Generation Z, but Millennials and people in Generation X might use it as well."

      "content": "The term exploded in popularity on TikTok and X in 2022. It wasn’t until late 2022 and 2023 that people started using “medium ugly” extensively. Usually, this term is used to describe male celebrities online, but some people use “medium ugly” to describe others in person or to talk about the type of people they like to date. For example, TikTok user @dariapliu posted a video captioned, “not him think that he’s hot bc i chose him over others but my taste is medium ugly guys.” In another video, TikTok user @myhoangxx captured their friend running with the caption “there will be hot guys at the party.” The user then runs past their friend, and the caption “there will be medium ugly guys there” appears."

      "title": "“Medium ugly” is not a compliment and can be insulting.",
      "content": "“Medium ugly” is not a compliment and can be insulting. If someone calls another person “medium ugly\" they find them attractive, but not so perfect that their beauty or looks are intimidating. However, this compliment is backhanded and can be upsetting or confusing. It’s best not to use this term to describe someone in person or online. There’s been a ton of discourse online about people calling people “medium ugly” in person. For example, TikTok user @crazyjamjam says “Ladies, I understand liking a boy that’s medium ugly… but if you say that to a boy that you like, that would make me feel like sh*t.” If someone calls you “medium ugly” and you feel hurt by it, consider using an “I statement” to let them know. [2] X Research source You might say, “I know you didn’t intend to hurt me, but that comment really bothered me.”"

      "content": "“Hot ugly” is a person who is just shy of being drop-dead gorgeous. Like “medium ugly,” “hot ugly” means the person meets beauty standards but may not be attractive to everyone. [3] X Research source However, the difference is that a “hot ugly” person is more often seen as physically attractive, even though they may have one or two unattractive features. [4] X Research source Examples of celebrities who have been called “hot ugly” include Zac Efron, Liam Hemsworth, Noah Beck, and Noah Centineo. “Medium ugly” is closer to “ugly hot,” which describes a person who isn’t conventionally attractive but has a personality or confidence that makes them hot.

      "title": "“Medium ugly” emphasizes the beauty standards for men.",
      "content": "“Medium ugly” emphasizes the beauty standards for men. Beauty standards for women have been talked about for years. However, men are also victims of societal expectations—they may feel like they have to be buff with a six-pack to be considered “hot” or “handsome.” Using phrases like “medium ugly” throws harsh criticism on men who don’t meet that standard. [6] X Research source Online, this can encourage people to label men as “medium ugly” who, offline, aren’t considered ugly at all. Although beauty standards are changing to accept plus-sized men and men with more traditionally feminine features, terms like “medium ugly” may help to reinforce them again."
