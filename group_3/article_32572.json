      "content": "Check the oil and top it off if necessary. One of the most simple ways you can extend the life or your automobile without paying for costly tune-ups is to check your oil level regularly and add more oil, if it's low. It only takes a minute or two to check the level, and the dipstick included in your engine block makes the job a snap for even the novice. [1] X Trustworthy Source Consumer Reports Nonprofit organization dedicated to consumer advocacy and product testing Go to source Find the cap on your engine, usually labeled \"Oil\" and find the dipstick that should be close by on the engine block. Do this when the engine's had a chance to cool down, or do it first thing in the morning to get the most accurate reading. Remove the dipstick and wipe off the oil with a paper towel or rag. Examine the rag. Is the oil especially black? Do you notice any sediment, or chunky-looking oil? If so, you're probably in need of an oil change. Put the dipstick back and remove it once more to check the level. Notches on the dipstick should tell you how full the compartment should be. [2] X Research source If you're low, remove the cap and add a small amount of a high-grade motor oil appropriate for your type of engine. Ask at the auto parts store if you're unsure about what kind of oil to use. Use a funnel to avoid spillage, and recheck the level once you've topped it off."

Regularly inspecting tires and rotating them can help to avoid this irritation. [3] X Expert Source Ed Beery Automotive Specialist Expert Interview. 19 November 2021. [4] X Research source Check both the air pressure in your tires, and check the tread for wear and replace the tires if you need to. You can use a pressure gauge at most gas stations, or you can buy one for a few dollars at an auto parts store and keep it in your glove box for regular checks. Open the driver's side door and look at the sticker on the doorjamb — this will tell you the recommended pressure for your tires. There is also a number printed on your tires, but this is the maximum PSI for your tires, which is generally more PSI than you want or need. Don't over-inflate. Keeping your tires inflated to the proper specifications improves gas mileage and handling. [5] X Research source"

Find the windshield washer fluid compartment, transmission fluid, brake fluid, as well as the anti-freeze compartment to make sure they're both full and clean, and add more fluid if necessary.

This isn't something you'll need to check every week, but doing it semi-regularly will ensure that your car is in good working order. The transmission fluid dipstick should be easily identified in your owner's manual. Sometimes it is the only other dipstick in an automatic transmission vehicle, but some vehicles have dipsticks for power steering and coolant as well. . Remove it, wipe it off, and read the level. It should be mostly clear, with a kind of red color to it. You'll only need to change transmission fluid every 100,000 miles (160,000 km) or so. Some manufacturers recommend 60,000 or even 30,000 for transmission fluid replacement — always go with the manufacturers recommendation. [7] X Research source The brake fluid is housed in a white plastic reservoir in the engine compartment, labeled \"brake fluid.\" This should only ever decrease slightly, unless you've got a leak in your line somewhere, which means you need to take it into be serviced immediately, or check the lines yourself. [8] X Research source Radiator fluid or coolant needs to be checked when the engine is stone cold. When the engine heats, even a little, scalding radiator fluid will literally shoot out of the cap when you remove it. Be extremely careful. If you start noticing a strange, sickly-sweet smell that comes through your air-conditioner ducts as you're driving, you might have a coolant leak, causing glycol to drip onto the engine compartment and burn. If your levels are low, this could be the cause. [9] X Research source Radiator fluid should often be changed according to manufactures instructions often every every 30,000 miles. [10] X Expert Source Jason Shackelford Auto Technician Expert Interview. 11 June 2019. Power steering fluid and windshield washer fluid are both housed in the engine compartment in plastic reservoirs, though some are built into the pump itself as well. Power-steering fluid will often have a mark for a cold engine and a hot engine, so look at the right level to check, adding more if necessary. [11] X Research source Wiper-fluid isn't essential to the car's life, but you can extend the life of your wipers by making sure it's full. [12] X Research source"

If you're noticing the car doesn't start up as crisply as it used to, inspect these contact points. [14] X Research source Clean them , if necessary, with baking soda and an old toothbrush.

Have a helper turn on the turn signals and pump the brakes while parked to check for burn-outs or misalignments. To check the brights, you can park aimed at a wall and flash them.

While you're doing an oil change, though, is usually a good opportunity to change the filter, which increases the life of your vehicle. [22] X Research source Changing the oil is an intermediate-level project. While there's nothing difficult about the task itself, you've got to have the space and materials necessary (you'll need fresh oil, an oil pan, and jack-stands or ramps). It's relatively cheap and quick to take it into the shop to have it done, especially if you live in the city and don't have a good space to tune up your car yourself. The service interval of 3,000 miles (5,000 km) can vary from vehicle to vehicle.

To even out the wear on your tires and get more life out of them, it's helpful to rotate them periodically, using the correct crossing pattern.

Removing the air filter and cleaning it thoroughly (even just gently blowing some compressed air through it and wiping it off) can help extend the life of your engine considerably. Keep in mind that some air filter materials are very soft and fragile. A hard blast of compressed air can blow a hole through some air filters and prevent them from filtering any air at all. [25] X Research source If your air filter is not on top of the engine, it may be located in an air box with duct work that travels from the front of the vehicle to the box then to the throttle body. Some air cleaners are not even noticeable from under the hood and must be serviced from under the car."

Manual transmissions can be shifted to a lower gear and, thereby, use the engine to slow the car, while drivers of cars with automatic transmissions need to be more careful about decelerating strongly at the last moment. Going straight from accelerating to braking puts a lot of wear on your brake pads, regardless of the kind of transmission you have, so it's important to anticipate your stops and coast into them. Never accelerate toward red lights. Take your foot off the gas and maintain your speed in preparation for a stop."

Avoid fueling at gas stations that have just been delivered a load of gas. If you see a filling station receiving a tanker load of gas, go elsewhere. When the new gas is dumped into the tank, sediment and water on the bottom of the tank tends to get distributed throughout the tank. Even though there are filters at the pump and in your car, these do not catch everything and will clog over time. It is best to avoid fueling at these times. If there are not nearby stations, take a break, go to the bathroom, walk around and wait for 15 or 20 minutes for the gas to settle in the underground tank. It is also best to pump your gas slowly, as vapors escape faster when the pump runs full speed."
