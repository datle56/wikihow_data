Soak the crayons in a bowl of hot water for a few minutes to loosen the wrapper, then peel the wrapper off. Some crayons have very loose wrappers. You might be able to simply slide these off."

If you have multiple colors, then put each color group into a separate container. If you wish to make candles out of crayons, then use one part shaved candle wax to one part crayon. [1] X Research source You can also add a few drops of essential oil or candle-making fragrance. If you are making lipstick , then you will need one crayon (you can use one color, or different colors amounting to one crayon) and ½ teaspoon of shea butter, and ½ teaspoon of oil, such as almond oil, Argan oil, coconut oil, jojoba oil, or olive oil."

Peel the wrapper off. [2] X Research source Soak the crayon in a bowl of hot water for a few minutes. The water will soften the paper and make it easier to remove.

Silicone has a very high melting point, so it is safe to use in the oven. If you are using a cupcake or muffin tin, consider lightly greasing the wells with cooking spray or shortening. This will prevent any sticking. You can also line the wells with cupcake liners instead. If you are using a silicone mold, you do not need to line it or grease it. The mold is stick-resistant and flexible, so the melted crayons (once hardened) will easily \"pop\" out."

This is because the crayons will spread out and fill in the gaps when they melt. Consider matching colors to the shape. For example, if your mold has different shapes, such as stars and hearts, put the reds and pinks in the heart-shaped well, and the yellows and blues in the star-shaped well. Consider mixing and matching some colors. Try putting reds, oranges, and yellows into one shape, blues and greens into another, and pinks and purples into a third."

You can tell if the wax has set if the bottom of the mold or tin is cool to the touch. Once the wax has set, turn the mold upside down. If you are using cupcake or muffin tins, the crayons should pop right out. If they don't, you can lightly tap the tray against the counter. If you are using a silicone mold, gently grip the edges of the mold, and press down on the bulging shape, pushing the crayon out."
