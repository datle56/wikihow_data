      "content": "Acquire your own Sabacc cards. A traditional Sabacc deck has 76 cards with unique suits and values, so you can’t substitute it with a regular deck of cards. Search online for a customized deck, so you can play the game as it’s meant to be played in the Star Wars universe. [2] X Research source You can find printable Sabacc cards here: http://www.swagonline.net/sabacc-swag-way . You can also buy Sabacc cards online."

      "content": "Review the special card values in a Sabacc deck. Sabacc cards traditionally fall into the saber, flask, coin, or stave suits. While a Sabacc deck has regular numbered cards, it also has “ranked cards” known as the Ace, Master, Mistress, and Commander, along with “face cards,” which are known as “The Star,” “The Evil One,” “Moderation,” “Demise,” “Balance,” “Endurance,” “Queen of Air and Darkness,” and “Idiot.” Keep in mind that Sabacc cards have both negative and positive values, unlike traditional cards. [3] X Research source The Commander card is worth 12 points, the Mistress 13 points, the Master 14 points, and the Ace 15 points. The Star is worth -17 points, The Evil One is worth -15 points, Moderation is worth -14 points, Demise is worth -13 points, Balance is worth -11 points, Endurance is worth -8 points, Queen of Air and Darkness is worth -2 points, and Idiot is worth 0 points."

      "title": "Aim to have a card total of 23 or -23.",
      "content": "Aim to have a card total of 23 or -23. Like Blackjack, Sabacc revolves around players trying to collect multiple cards that equal a 23 or -23, or “Pure Sabacc,” that will win them the round. You can also win the round by getting an “Idiot’s Array,” which includes the “Idiot” card, along with a 2- or 3-valued card. If your hand is higher or lower than 23 or -23, you’ll “bomb out,” or be disqualified from the round. [4] X Research source If 1 player has an Idiot’s Array and another player has a Pure Sabacc, the player with the Idiot’s Array will win the round."

      "title": "Identify the Main Pot and the Sabacc Pot.",
      "content": "Identify the Main Pot and the Sabacc Pot. Sabacc has 2 “pots,” where bets are collected throughout each round. The Main Pot automatically goes to the winner of the round, while you need a perfect score of 23 or -23 or earn a special card combination to also earn the Sabacc Pot. [5] X Research source Do your best to separate these pots into separate piles."

      "title": "Choose a dealer and start gameplay to the left of them.",
      "content": "Choose a dealer and start gameplay to the left of them. Pick someone to distribute the cards throughout the game. With this in mind, always keep playing going in a clockwise direction, with the player left of the dealer starting each round. This will help you keep track of who has or hasn’t gone throughout the game. [6] X Research source Any person can be the dealer, as long as they’re okay with a little extra responsibility."

      "title": "Distribute equal amounts of betting chips to each player.",
      "content": "Distribute equal amounts of betting chips to each player. Grab some betting chips that you’d use for a regular poker game. Rename these chips as “credits,” like they’re called in the Star Wars universe. You can assign different “credit” values to each chip color, which will apply to the rest of the game. [7] X Research source For instance, blue chips can be worth 5 credits, white chips can be worth 10 credits, and so on."

      "content": "Put a preliminary bet in the Main Pot and Sabacc Pot. Ask each player to put a small amount of game currency into both the Main and Sabacc pots. These don’t have to be huge wagers—just enough to get the game going and add a little incentive. [8] X Research source You’ll add the same amount to the Sabacc pot during each hand. You and the other players can decide what this wager is before the game starts. For instance, some players put 5 credits into the Sabacc Pot each hand. [9] X Research source It may take a few rounds before anyone wins something from the Sabacc pot."

Place the cards face-down, reminding players not to share their card totals just yet. Once everyone has 1 card, deal another card face-down to all the players. [10] X Research source In this way, Sabacc is very similar to traditional poker games."

      "content": "Draw, trade, or stand the cards in your hand before betting. Go around the circle once, giving each player a chance to draw a new card, trade in 1 card with the dealer or keep the cards they have, which is known as a stand. You’ll need to use your wits during this part of the round—while you can draw new cards to get yourself closer to a score of 23 or -23, there’s a chance you can deflate/inflate your score with a positive or negative card. You also don’t want your hand to be too high or too low, or else you’ll bomb out. [11] X Research source A score higher than 23 and lower than -23 will disqualify you from winning the round."

      "content": "Roll a pair of dice after each individual play, each betting round, and after a game call. Get in the habit of rolling 2 identical dice frequently throughout the game. Remind each player to roll the dice after their initial turn, then roll the dice again after each betting round concludes. After the game is “called” by all the players, the dice must be rolled again to see if a shift will occur. [14] X Research source In the Star Wars universe, androids send out a pulse that automatically changes the value of your cards. In the regular universe, dice replace this randomizing pulse. The dice add another unpredictable element to the game."

If the dice are identical, encourage all players to return their cards to the dealer, where they’ll be reshuffled and dealt to the players again. Before handing in your cards for the “shift,” count how many you have—the dealer needs to give you the same amount of cards that you had before.

Once each turn, you can place a card face-up in this area, which will allow you to use and play this card later on. Keep in mind that you can only “lock” 1 card into this zone at a time, so choose wisely! Other players will be able to see whichever cards you lock."
