      "content": "You’ll be much less tempted if the food’s not in your pantry. If there are certain things you always crave (chips, cookies, chocolate), don’t buy them at the grocery store. Then, the next time you get a craving, you’ll have to go to extra effort to find the food you want. If you live with other people, explain to them what you’re doing and ask them not to bring specific foods into the house. Try to eat a full meal before you go to the grocery store. Shopping while hungry can lead to a lot of impulse purchases, which is never good for your wallet or your stomach."

      "content": "Cravings usually pass after 20 minutes or so. In the meantime, go do something engaging to get your mind off of food. Go for a walk, do a puzzle, read a book, or listen to a podcast. The more you can think about other things, the more you can beat your cravings. Try to do something that actually engages your brain. Watching TV or scrolling through social media aren’t distracting enough, and you might end up thinking about food anyway. You can also try telling yourself to just put off your craving for about 5 minutes. Then go for 10 minutes, then 20 minutes."
