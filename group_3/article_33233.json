      "content": "The game is played with two players. In MTG, two players face off as powerful wizards who cast spells and summon creatures to defeat one another. You can play games where you fight against more than two players, but the most common way to play is by squaring off against a single player. [1] X Research source There are two exceptions: Draft formats (like Cube , or Limited) can have 4-16 players. Games of Commander (EDH) require 4 players. Garvin actually suggests starting with Commander if you aren’t hyper-competitive. “Commander is generally much more casual—it’s multiplayer, so you’re usually playing with two to three other people, maybe more. Because it’s multiplayer and everyone kind of keeps each other in check, it’s not nearly as competitive as one-on-one formats.”"

In a constructed deck —a deck you build ahead of time— the minimum number of cards is 60 (with no upper limit). Players, however, usually choose to stick to the minimum of 60 cards. In a limited deck —a deck you build out of cards you draft—the deck size is a minimum of 40. [2] X Research source A player's 60- or 40-card deck is called their library . Any card that refers to the library is referring to your remaining deck of cards. Unless a card says otherwise (like Rat Colony ) or it is a basic land, you cannot put more than 4 copies of the same card in your deck."

      "content": "Each player starts with 20 health. During the course of a game, a player can gain or lose life. Generally, having more life is better than having less life, but you do not lose the game until your life total reaches 0 or less. [3] X Research source Players deal damage to both creatures and to each other. Damage is dealt either by creatures or by spells. Damage is measured by the number of hit points it causes. If player one deals 4 damage to player two, player two loses 4 life. If player two started out with 20 life, they now have only 16 life. (20 - 4 = 16) In Commander (EDH), players start with 40 life instead of 20 life."

Here are the four ways, though: When a player's life total is at or below 0 , that player has lost. When, at the beginning of their turn, a player can no longer draw any cards from his or her library , that player has lost. When a player has received 10 poison counters , that player has lost. When a card that says you lose the game has its condition met . Examples of cards that have a lose the game condition include cards like Chance For Glory , Demonic Pact , and Nefarious Lich ."

There are also colorless cards, but they do not have the same core identity or mechanics as the normal colored cards. [4] X Research source White is the color of protection, community, and truth. The symbol of white is a white sun. White's strengths are a host of small creatures that collectively become powerful, life-gaining, or evasive. They might reduce the powers of opposing creatures or equalize games by killing large numbers of creatures at once. Blue is the color of deceit, intellect, and knowledge. The symbol of blue is a blue water drop. Blue's strengths are drawing cards, taking control of opponents' cards, countering (negating opponents' spells), and flying creatures or creatures that cannot be blocked. Black is the color of death, greed, and individualism. The symbol of black is a black skull. Black's strengths are destroying creatures, forcing opponents to discard cards, making players lose life, and returning creatures from graveyards. Red is the color of fury, chaos, and passion. The symbol of red is a red fireball. Red's strengths are sacrificing resources for great power, dealing direct damage to players or creatures, and destroying artifacts and lands. Green is the color of life, nature, and independence. The symbol of green is a green tree. Green's strengths are powerful creatures with trample, the ability to regenerate creatures (or bring them back from the graveyard), and getting lands faster (called ramping)."

      "content": "At the beginning of each game, each player draws 7 cards. These 7 cards compose a player's hand. At the beginning of each turn, a player draws one card and adds that card to their hand. [5] X Research source When a player discards a card, uses a card, or when a creature dies or a spell is destroyed, that card is put in a player's graveyard. The graveyard is a face-up pile that players usually place adjacent to their library. Mulligan rules, as explained by an expert: Garvin explains what happens if you don’t like your opening hand: “You draw your first 7 cards, you hate them, and you need a new hand. So, you shuffle all the cards back into your library, you draw a new 7, and then you put a number of cards from your hand on the bottom of your library once you decide to keep the hand. The number of cards you put on the bottom equals the number of times you've mulliganed. So, if you mulligan twice, you put 2 cards on the bottom. If you mulligan once, you put 1 card on the bottom.”"

      "title": "Creatures can attack a player, but not a specific opposing creature.",
      "content": "Creatures can attack a player, but not a specific opposing creature. One of the core rules of Magic that a lot of newer players seem to struggle with is how combat works. When it’s your turn, you get to attack (if you want to) with your creatures. However, you can only attack a player (or planeswalker). You cannot choose to deal damage to an opposing player’s creature in combat—they have to block a creature for damage to be dealt. As an example: Nick and Sara are playing. Nick has a V ampire Nighthawk and Sara has a Kor Skyfisher . Nick can attack Sara, but he cannot say, My Nighthawk attacks your Skyfisher. The only way for the Nighthawk to kill the Skyfisher is if Sara blocks Nick’s Nighthawk with it, or if Sara attacks with the Skyfisher and Nick blocks with the Nighthawk."

Lands produce magical energy, or mana, which is the fuel used to cast other spells. [6] X Research source The five basic lands are as follows: White lands, or Plains, which produce white mana Blue lands, or Islands, which produce blue mana Black lands, or Swamps, which produce black mana Red lands, or Mountains, which produce red mana Green lands, or Forests, which produce green mana There are also different kinds of lands (dual-lands and tri-lands, for example), but the most a beginner needs to know is that basic lands produce mana of one color only, and that multicolor lands can produce mana of two or more colors."

      "content": "Enchantments: spells that stay on the field or attach to creatures Enchantments are like stable manifestations of magical effects that do not go away. Enchantments come in two flavors: either they are attached to a creature, affecting only that one card, in which case they are called an Aura ; or they sit around the battlefield, close to lands, unattached to any card in particular, but affecting the game in some way for you. [9] X Research source Enchantments are permanents , meaning that they stay on the battlefield unless they are destroyed. Permanents do not immediately go to the graveyard right after they are cast. Other permanents include lands, enchantments, and creatures. If a creature with an aura is destroyed, the aura goes to the graveyard with the creature."

      "content": "Artifacts: items, objects, or creatures with (usually) no color Artifacts are magical items, and also permanents. Artifacts are colorless most of the time, which means they don't need to be summoned by a particular mana type. [10] X Research source There are three basic kinds of artifacts: Normal artifacts : these artifacts are similar to enchantments. The just hang out on the battlefield (and provide an ability or offer a permanent effect). Equipment : these cards can be attached to creatures, giving them extra abilities. If the creature leaves the battlefield, the equipment stays on the battlefield; it doesn't follow the creature into the graveyard, even if it was attached to it. Artifact creatures : these cards are creatures and artifacts at the same time. They are just like creatures, except they usually don't take specific mana to summon: you can summon them with any mana you want. Because they are often colorless, most are also immune to certain spells that affect specific colors."

      "title": "Creatures: the beings you summon to fight and block",
      "content": "Creatures: the beings you summon to fight and block Creatures are one of the main building blocks of Magic. Creatures are permanents, meaning they stay on the battlefield until they are destroyed or otherwise removed from the game. The main feature of creatures is that they can attack and block. The two numbers in the bottom right hand corner (4/5, for example) help you determine a creature's attacking and blocking strength, respectively. [11] X Research source Creatures enter the battlefield with what's called summoning sickness . Summoning sickness means that a creature cannot tap or attack on the same turn it was brought into play. This means it cannot attack or use certain abilities that cause the creature to tap. On the other hand, the creature is allowed to block; blocking is not affected by summoning sickness. Garvin explains a fun trick with flash creatures: “Some creatures have flash, which allows you to play them on your opponent’s turn. If you play them on your opponent’s end step, the summoning sickness wears off right away at the start of your turn.” Many creatures have special abilities (called keywords ), such as flying, vigilance, or trample, that we'll learn more about later."

They are much rarer than other card types, and they don't always make appearances in games, and they change the fundamentals of the game slightly when in play. [12] X Research source Each planeswalker enters the battlefield with a certain number of loyalty counters on it, which represent the planeswalker’s health. You can activate one ability of a planeswalker you control once a turn, but only during a main phase when you would cast a sorcery. Planeswalkers can be attacked by your opponent's creatures and spells. You can block the incoming attack on the planeswalker with your creatures and spells. In the case that your opponent deals damage to a planeswalker, it removes as many loyalty counters as points of damage dealt. When a planeswalker has no loyalty counters on them, they are put into the graveyard."

You summon a creature by looking at its casting cost, which is usually a circled number followed by a specific color of mana—either white, blue, black, red, or green. In order to summon a creature, you need to produce mana equivalent to the card's casting cost. [13] X Research source Take a look at the card above. You'll notice a 1 followed by a white mana symbol—the white sun. In order to summon this particular card, you need to have enough lands to produce one mana of any color, along with one white mana. Skill check: How much do these cards cost? See if you can't figure out how many mana total, and which specific kinds, it takes to summon the following card: The Answer: The first card, ( Sylvan Bounty ), costs 5 generic mana—mana of any kind you want — along with one green mana—mana produced by a forest, for a total of six mana. The second card ( Angelic Shield ) costs one white mana, mana produced by a plains, along with one blue mana, which comes from an island."

You also have to tap a creature to attack with it (unless the creature has some other kind of ability that prevents that from happening). “Tap” is denoted by the little right arrow sign. In order to tap a card, you turn it sideways at a 90-degree angle. [14] X Research source You cannot use any activated abilities that require tapping if the creature is already tapped. In other words, Elvish Mystic cannot generate more than one mana a turn unless some other card causes it to untap. Cards that are tapped do not untap until that player’s next untap step. You cannot block with a creature that is tapped. When a creature is tapped, it is ineligible to block."

[15] X Research source Power is the number of points a creature can deal in combat. If a creature has a power of 5, it deals 5 damage to any creature who chooses to block it in combat. If that creature goes unblocked in combat, it deals 5 damage directly to the opponent, who subtracts that number from their total life. Defense is the number of points a creature can withstand in combat before it dies and is sent to the graveyard. A creature with a defense of 4 can withstand 3 points of damage in combat without dying. Once it is dealt 4 points of damage, the creature goes into that player's graveyard."

The defending player then gets to choose which of their creatures they wish to use as blockers, along with which attacking creatures they want to block. [16] X Research source Let's say that Anathemancer is attacking and Arboreal Grazer is blocking. Anathemancer has a power of 2 and a defense of 2. It's a 2/2. The Grazer has a power of 0 and a defense of 3. It's a 0/3. What happens when they square up for battle? The Anathemancer deals 2 damage to the Grazer, while the Grazer deals 0 damage to the Anathemancer. The 2 damage that the Anathemancer deals to the Grazer isn't enough to kill it. The Grazer can withstand 3 damage before it gets put in the graveyard. On the flip side, the 0 damage the Grazer deals to the Anathemancer isn't enough to kill it. The Anathemancer can withstand 2 before it gets put in the graveyard. Both creatures survive."

      "title": "Activated abilities",
      "content": "Activated abilities Much of the time, creatures come with abilities that players get to activate. Using these abilities is much like summoning the creature, in that you need to pay a cost, in mana, to use them. Look at the following example. [17] X Research source Icatian Crier comes with an ability that says: Put two 1/1 white Citizen creature tokens into play. But there are also some mana signs and text before it. That's the mana cost it takes in order to activate this ability. In order to activate this ability, tap one basic land of any color (that's for the 1 generic mana), as well as one Plains (that's for the one white mana). Now, tap the card itself to pay for the activated ability cost (that's the little tap sign after the mana requirements, but before the colon). Finally, discard a card from your hand—any card will do, but you probably want to discard your least valuable card. Now you get to put two 1/1 Citizen tokens into play. These function as basic 1/1 creatures."

Players often group these 3 together because players rarely take action independently during any of these steps, but it can (and will) happen on occasion (for example, a player may want to cast Vendilion Clique on their opponent during the draw step to see what they drew). The 3 parts of the beginning phase are: Untap step : the active player untaps all his cards unless that card stays tapped during Untap. Upkeep step : not usually used, but sometimes a player has to pay mana—i.e. tap lands—during this step. Draw step : the active player draws one card."

      "title": "Combat phase",
      "content": "Combat phase Like the beginning phase, combat actually contains 5 steps. Garvin explains: “There’s the beginning of combat step, where effects take place, then the declare attackers step, followed by the declare blockers step, and finally the damage step. At events like prereleases, where newer players face experienced ones, I see new players get surprised by all the different opportunities to interact during combat. For example, blocking isn’t as simple as it seems—you can double or even triple-block a creature.” Players usually just skip a few of these steps and go straight to blockers and damage assignment because there isn’t anything for them to do. The 5 steps are: Beginning of combat (moving to attacks): this is where the player first declares an attack. The defender may play spells after the attack has been declared. Declare attackers : after attack has been declared, the attacking player chooses which creatures he wishes to attack with. The attacking player cannot choose which defending creatures he wishes to attack. Declare blockers : the defending player chooses which, if any, attacking creatures s/he wishes to block. Multiple blockers can be assigned to a single attacker. Assign damage : creatures deal damage to one another during this step. Attacking creatures with equal (or higher) power to the blocking creature’s defense will cause the blocking creature to die. If the blocking creature’s power is equal to (or higher than) the attacking creature’s defense, the attacking creature dies. End of combat : nothing much happens during this phase; both players are given the opportunity to cast instants."

[20] X Research source Which main phase you use is super important. New players tend to ignore the second main phase and cast all of their stuff during the first main phase. By holding on to other cards you want to play, you can mess with your opponent’s blocks during combat! They may think you’re holding a crucial spell or waiting for you to block the way they’re expected to."

The strength of one is measured against the toughness of the other, and vice versa. First strike changes the order of this process: [23] X Research source Usually, damage is assigned at the same time. So, if the attacking creature's strength overpowers the defending creature's toughness, and the defending creature's strength overpowers the attacking creature's toughness, both creatures die. If, however, one creature has first strike, that creature is given a first chance shot at knocking the other creature out with impunity: if the creature with first strike can kill the defending creature, the defending creature dies immediately, even if the defending creature would otherwise kill the attacking creature. The attacking creature stays alive. For example, if an Elite Inquisitor (a 2/2 with first strike) blocks a Grizzly Bear (a 2/2 with no abilities), the Inquisitor deals damage before the Bear can, so the Bears dies and the Inquisitor survives"

With trample, the difference between the trampling creature's strength and the blocking creature's toughness is dealt to the opponent. [26] X Research source For example, let's say that Kavu Mauler is attacking and Bonethorn Valesk decides to block it. The Mauler is a 4/4 with trample, while the Valesk is a 4/2. The Mauler deals 4 damage to the Valesk, while the Valesk deals 4 damage back to the Mauler. Both creatures die, but the Mauler manages to sneak in 2 damage to the opponent. Why? Because the Valesk's toughness is only 2, and the Mauler has trample, which means 2 of its 4 damage gets dealt to the Valesk, and 2 gets dealt to the opponent."

A creature with both First Strike and Death Touch can deal damage before the opposing creature gets a chance to attack back.
