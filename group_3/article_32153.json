      "content": "Use a power washer to clean the gutters fast. Start by cleaning off dirt and debris on the gutters. Rent a power washer or buy one at your local hardware store or online. The power washer will have an extendable arm, making it easy and quick for you to clean the gutters. [1] X Research source You can stand on a ladder if you'd like to get closer to the gutters to clean them. Ensure your gutters aren’t loose or severely rusted prior to power-washing them to avoid potential damage. Do a thorough rinse of the gutters using the power washer, making sure you spray off any caked on dirt, debris, or flaking paint in the corners and underneath the gutters."

      "title": "Scrub the gutters with mild soap and water if you don't have a power washer.",
      "content": "Scrub the gutters with mild soap and water if you don't have a power washer. Combine 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of mild soap with 8 cups (1.9 l) of water. Stand on a ladder, directly underneath the gutters. Dip a horsehair brush or a brush with soft bristles in the soapy water and scrub down the gutters well. This method will require a bit more elbow grease and take more time. You may find it easier to take off the gutters and place them on a flat surface to scrub them down. Make sure you lay them out in order as you take them off so it is easy for you to put them back together."

      "content": "Clean the gutters with a mildew retardant if they have mildew or mold. If you notice your gutters have mildew on them, remove it with a retardant. Look for a mildew retardant at your local hardware store or online. The retardant will contain chemicals that will help to remove mildew and prevent it from forming. [2] X Research source Follow the application instructions on the label. Do not apply more than recommended. Wear gloves and a face mask when applying the mildew retardant so you are protected."

      "content": "Let the gutters air dry. Once you have cleaned the gutters well, allow them to dry for 4-6 hours, preferably on a sunny day. Flip the gutters over every few hours to allow water to drain out of the cracks and crevices. It's essential that the area is extremely clean before you apply your new layer of paint.

      "content": "Strip off the old paint with a plastic putty knife. A plastic putty knife is ideal, as it will not scratch the gutters like a metal or steel wire brush might. Scratch off old paint on the gutters with the putty knife, putting pressure on the knife as you scrape off the paint using long strokes. Try to get off as much of the old paint as you can.

      "title": "Apply paint stripping chemicals.",
      "content": "Apply paint stripping chemicals. If the old paint is really caked onto the gutters, you can use paint stripping chemicals to make it easier to take it off. Apply a small dab of paint stripper to a rag. Use the rag to scrub off the paint. [5] X Research source Do not use too much paint stripper, as the chemicals can be bad for you to inhale. Dab on small amounts so you do not apply too much. Wear gloves and a face mask to protect yourself from the fumes."

Sanding will create a smooth surface and help the new paint to adhere better to the gutters. [6] X Research source To save time, use a palm sander instead of a sanding block. Try to make the surface of the gutters as smooth as possible. Take your time, sanding the sides and bottom of the gutters."

      "content": "Use pieces of cardboard to protect your home from the paint. Rest small pieces of cardboard or poster board on top of and behind the gutters to make sure paint does not get on your home. Use painter’s tape to attach the cardboard to the top of the gutters, especially if it’s windy outside. [8] X Research source Thoroughly cover the soffit, fascia, and siding of your home so paint does not get on it. Use old boxes or scrap cardboard. Cut the cardboard to fit the top of the gutters, especially the corners. You do not need to use painter's tape to mask the house as long as you place cardboard on the gutters to protect the house. You will be working closely with the primer and paint so the risk of getting a lot of it on your home is low."

Rent a paint sprayer or buy one at your local hardware store. [10] X Research source If you opt to use a sprayer, mask the roof, fascia, and siding to prevent overspray from getting on your home. Keep a damp cloth on hand to wipe up any paint that gets on unwanted areas. Use the low pressure setting on the sprayer to apply one light coat of primer. Spray the sides and bottom of the gutters to prime them. Wear a respirator mask when you use the sprayer to protect yourself from the paint fumes."

      "content": "Apply a coat of primer with a paintbrush or roller if you don't have a sprayer. If you’d prefer to prime the gutters the old-fashioned way, use a paintbrush or roller that is 3 to 4 inches (7.6 to 10.2 cm) wide. Paint a thin coat of primer on the sides and bottom of the gutters. Do not apply too much primer, as this can make it difficult for the top coat to spread smoothly and evenly on the gutters."
