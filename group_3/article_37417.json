Let your friend know that you’re someone they should feel safe around and that they were right to reach out to you for support. Say something like: [7] X Research source “Thank you for trusting me enough to share this with me.” “I’m grateful to you for confiding in me.” “I know it’s hard to talk about these things, but I’m glad you did.”"
