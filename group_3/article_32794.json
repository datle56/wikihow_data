Pink flags are small things that may potentially signify that something is a problem, or at the very least, that there will be conflict that needs to be worked through. A pink flag lies in between a red flag and a green flag and ranges in severity, but it’s generally not as serious as a yellow “warning” flag. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Red flags are warning signs that a relationship isn't good for you. While pink flags are light, subtle warnings, psychologist Dr. Asa Don Brown describes red flags as “the body’s subconscious and conscious warning signals relating to dangers, threats, hazards, or the potential therein. Red flags are not personal quirks, such as an individual’s particular desires, tastes, or interests. They are any behavior that is unwarranted, inappropriate, and incongruous with your perspectives on a relationship.” Dating coach John Keegan says some red flags that someone is using you include feeling like you’re putting in all of the effort and they aren’t giving back, feeling like they don’t care about you or your wellbeing, and a lack of deep connection. Clinical psychologist Tala Johartchi says other red flags include feeling like “you're always constantly falling into a role of rescuing or feeling like you're constantly being needed.”"

Some people prefer to calm down before approaching conflict, and there’s nothing wrong with that! But, if you two have never disagreed, or you notice that they roll over and submit to you whenever there’s a conflict, they may not be acknowledging their own feelings about the situation, which can lead to resentment and impact the relationship.

Some people take a while to introduce you to their friends, as well. But if you’ve been together for months, years, or longer, and you still haven’t met their friends or family, they may want to keep your relationship a secret.
