      "content": "Say hej to greet people in most situations. As in English, there are many different words and phrases you can use to say \"hello\" in Swedish. However, hej is the most commonly used. Since it's suitable for any situation, it's really the only word you need. [2] X Research source You may also hear hallå (hah-loh), which is another common way of saying \"hello\" (and sounds much like the English word)."

      "content": "Use tjenare (SHEH-nah-reh) or tja (sheh) when greeting a close buddy. This greeting is similar to saying \"hey\" or \"hi\" in English. It's a common greeting among friends or people your own age. [3] X Research source Tjenare or tja are also appropriate in more casual settings. You typically wouldn't use this greeting if you were applying for a job, or talking to someone in a position of authority over you, such as a teacher or a police officer. However, since Swedish is a relatively informal language, it's considered okay in most other situations."

      "content": "Wish elderly people god dag (good dahg) to be more respectful. Swedes are relatively informal people generally, but many older people prefer to be addressed with a more formal greeting than hej . God dag means \"good day,\" but is used more similarly to the phrase \"how do you do\" in English. This phrase might also be used on more formal occasions, or when you're addressing someone in a position of authority. Similarly, god kväll (good kvail), which means \"good evening,\" is reserved solely for the most formal of situations, and rarely used in day-to-day conversations."

      "content": "Vary your greeting with god morgon (good mor-rohn). Before noon, but especially in the early morning, it's still common in Swedish to say \"good morning\" as a greeting. This greeting is appropriate in both formal and informal settings. [4] X Research source You can combine god morgon with hej , especially if you're greeting someone with whom you're already familiar. For example, you might say \"Hej hej! God morgon!\""

      "content": "Ask hur har du det to inquire after the person's wellbeing. This phrase is relatively informal, but is perhaps the most common way in Swedish to ask \"How are you?\" A literal translation would be \"How have you it?\" [5] X Research source It's also common to ask Hur är lä get? This phrase means \"how is the situation,\" and is a bit more informal than hur har du det . If you are friends with the person or know them fairly well, you can abbreviate the phrase further and simply say Lä get?"

      "title": "Say hej då (hey doh) when taking your leave.",
      "content": "Say hej då (hey doh) when taking your leave. There's no specific word for \"goodbye\" in Swedish. Hej då is the most common thing to say when parting ways, but some Swedes also simply say hej again. [6] X Research source A literal translation for hej då is \"hello then.\" Adjö (ah-dieu) is also used. This is a very formal, dismissive goodbye, similar to how you might say \"good day\" in English. Note that it sounds similar to the French word \"adieu.\" Farväl (fahr-vehl), which means \"farewell,\" is considered antiquated and not used very often. However, it can be a fun way to part ways if you're feeling particularly dramatic. You could perhaps accompany the word with a deep bow."

Jag (yahg) is the first person pronoun in Swedish, while du (similar to the English word \"dew\") is the second person pronoun. Swedish also has a formal second-person pronoun, ni (nee), but it is rarely used in modern Swedish, except perhaps when addressing an elderly person. [7] X Research source The u sound in Swedish doesn't have an exact English counterpart. To pronounce words such as du , place your tongue in the same place you would if making a y sound, but round your lips more while making an ooo or eww sound. Han (hahn) is Swedish for \"he,\" while hon (hoon) is Swedish for \"her.\""

As Swedish is a relatively informal language and culture, you typically would introduce yourself with your first name only. [8] X Research source Native Swedish speakers tend to run the words together. When you do this, the g sound becomes less pronounced. The phrase ends up sounding more like \"yah-yay-tuhr.\" To ask the other person their name, you would say Vad heter du? (vahd hay-tuhr dew). You can also say och du (ahk dew) after introducing yourself, which simply means \"and you?\""

Follow the phrase jag kommer från (yahg kohm-mehr frohn) with the name of your home country. You can provide the name of your country in Swedish, or you can just use English. You'll likely be understood either way. [9] X Research source For example, if you wanted to say \"I'm from the United States,\" you could either say Jag kommer från Amérika , Jag kommer från USA , or Jag kommer från United States . To ask the other person where they are from, say Varifån kommer du?"

(tahlahr dew ehn-yeel-skuh) This means \"Do you speak English?\" If you're talking to someone who doesn't understand English very well, you might ask var kan jag hitta någon som talar engelska? (vohr kohn yahg hee-tuh noh-gahn tah-lahr ehn-yeel-skuh) This means \"Where can I find someone who speaks English?\" If the person you're talking to says something in Swedish that you don't understand, say jag förstår inte (yahg fuhrstoyr een-tay), which means \"I don't understand.\""

Unless you have something specific to ask someone, most Swedes see no point in chatting idly with strangers. However, they'll usually be happy to help you if you have a specific thing you want to know. [11] X Research source Start by learning the basic question words: vem (vehm) means \"who,\" vad (vahd) means \"what,\" när (nahr) means \"when,\" varför means \"why,\" (vahr-fuhr) and hur (hoor) means \"how.\" There are two Swedish words for \"where.\" Use vart (vahrt) when you're talking about where someone is going, and var (vahr) when you're talking about where someone currently is. However, you'll find little distinction between the two words when speaking in Swedish."

When asking someone a question, it's generally considered polite to tack the word tack onto the end of your question. [12] X Research source Snälla (snell-lah) is another word for \"please,\" considered more informal than tack . Varsågod (vahr-sah-good) means \"you're welcome,\" while förlåt (fuhr-loit) means \"sorry.\" Ursäkta (uhr-shehk-tuh) means \"excuse me.\" The phrase would literally be ursäkta mig , but the mig is not necessary in Swedish."

It means \"sorry,\" but in this context, it would be understood to mean \"please say that again.\""
