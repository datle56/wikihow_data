      "content": "Begin with 'Rwy'n'. This is the Welsh word which is used for 'I'. It is an abbreviated version of 'Rwyf yn', which is directly translated as 'I am'. Welsh grammar is different to English grammar, but for this phrase, the first word is the same. It is pronounced like 'ruin'. Some Welsh pronounce the last part of the word differently due to regional dialects, but it is easier for beginners to stick with the Southern pronunciation (ruin). When pronouncing this word, remember to pronounce it as one syllable rather than two."
