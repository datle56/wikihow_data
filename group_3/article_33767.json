      "content": "Power Hour is a non-competitive drinking game where players take a shot of beer every minute for an hour. The only goal of the game is to take a standard 1.5 oz (44 mL) shot of beer or another light beverage of your choice every minute for the duration of the hour—there’s no real winning or strategy involved! [1] X Research source Because of the simple rules, flexible number of players, and focus on fast drinking, Power Hour is often played as a pregame by large groups before heading out to a bar or party. [2] X Research source Power Hour is considered an endurance game against yourself, and the only real goal is to finish all 60 shots. However, it can be made competitive if the players wish. A timer or themed playlist is used to measure each minute. When the timer goes off or the song changes, it’s time to drink."

      "content": "Get 1 shot glass and 6–7 beers per player, then gather in a large room with a speaker. Choose a space like a patio or living room where everyone can gather comfortably and hear the timer or speaker you’re going to use. Make sure each person has their own shot glass to drink from, and at least 6 beers (or about 72 oz (2.1 L) of a different beverage) to last them throughout the hour, assuming they’re able to drink each minute. [3] X Research source Besides your drinking materials, you’ll also need a timer or playlist to mark the minutes and signal when it’s time to take a shot. Warning: You can technically play with whatever drink you want, but a light beer is best for endurance and for not making yourself sick. Shooting wine or liquor can get you very drunk very fast, so pour smaller shots or take shots less often if you opt for something stronger than beer."

Pour a new shot once you’re done drinking so that you’re not scrambling to refill before the next drink in 1 minute (this is especially helpful for beer, which will have some time to settle and de-foam). Other than that, you really don’t have any responsibilities during the minute; talk, hang out, take a sip of water, or zone out until you hear the song change or the timer go off. There’s no real competition or thought involved! [4] X Research source"

Keep taking beer shots every minute until the end if you can; if not, feel free to tap out early, start drinking every other minute, or take smaller sips each time. Since you’re not really competing, you can change your drinking strategy to suit you and your body. [5] X Research source Remember that everyone’s alcohol tolerance and metabolism are different, so just because you feel great after 20 minutes of beer shots doesn’t mean everyone will. Respect someone’s choice to cut back or take a break if they need to."

However, if only 1 person makes it all the way, you might consider them the de facto champion. Competitive variation: If you want to add some stakes to the Power Hour, consider giving a prize to whoever finishes the challenge or who lasts the longest. Prizes could be something tangible like a few dollars or a bottle of wine, or something mischievous and playful like the ability to “give a drink” to another player."

Assuming you take every shot and fill the glass all the way up, you’ll end up drinking about 90 ounces (2.6 liters) of beer. That means 7 and a half 12-oz cans of beer! [6] X Research source However, if you sit out a few rounds or fill your shot glasses part way, you may end up drinking closer to 6 beers. Plan to have at least 6 beers on hand at minimum to get through a full hour. Remember, the total amount you drink is up to you and how much alcohol you can handle. There’s no shame in cutting back or taking a break; you have a whole night ahead of you after the game!"

Your playlist doesn’t have to have a theme (it can have any songs you like!), but choosing something like “disco” or “2000’s hits” makes for a fun atmosphere and gives players something to listen to or enjoy between drinks. Once you’ve settled on a theme, choose 60 tracks for your playlist (1 song for each minute or round). [7] X Research source Platforms like Spotify and YouTube are typically the easiest to use for a Power Hour playlist. Tip: If you don’t have time to make a playlist (or just don’t want to), there are a ton that already exist! Try searching YouTube or Spotify for “power hour playlists” and see what genres and themes they have to offer."

You can also choose to take small sips throughout each round to avoid taking whole shots all at once. [10] X Research source There’s also no shame in tapping out early. Better to get a good buzz and enjoy the rest of the pregame than to force yourself to play and get sick!"

If you’re worried about the booze hitting you too fast (a fair concern in this type of game!), eat something beforehand or have some snacks available to munch on between shots. Food kickstarts your digestive processes which closes the valve at the bottom of your stomach. This slows down how much alcohol can enter your small intestine and intoxicate you. [11] X Research source High-protein and greasy or fatty foods are the best at blocking alcohol absorption. Think treats like chicken wings, cheese, pizza, fried foods, tacos, or nachos (AKA things you’d probably crave anyway after a few beers!). Have some water between shots, too. Staying hydrated and having water in your stomach will help you drink a bit less and prevent dehydration from alcohol (and help prevent a hangover , too)."

To help, pour your next shot as soon as you finish your current one and let it sit for a minute. That way, any foam will go down and it’ll be slightly less carbonated. Then, take slow and controlled sips so you don’t accidentally gulp down some air with your shot. [12] X Research source"
