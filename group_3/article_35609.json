      "content": "Wear loose, lightweight, and light-colored clothing to stay cool. If possible, take off extra layers of clothing. Lightweight fabrics like silk, chiffon, thin cotton, and linen are the best choices for extreme heat. In addition, try to wear white and other light colors, which can help beat the heat by reflecting sunlight.

      "content": "Sit in front of a fan or air conditioner. If possible, find an air-conditioned spot. If you don't have access to air conditioning at home, try spending time at the grocery store, movie theater, or at a friend's house. At the very least, sitting in front of a fan can help keep you cool. [2] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source If you only have access to a fan, try dampening your skin with cool water as you sit by the fan. The water on your skin will feel nice and cool you down as it evaporates."

      "title": "Fan yourself with long, gentle motions.",
      "content": "Fan yourself with long, gentle motions. If you can't get to an air conditioner or an electric fan, fanning yourself by hand can help lower your temperature. The key is to use a fan (or an improvised object) with a broad surface area and to avoid fanning yourself too vigorously. If your fanning motions are too fast, they'll get your blood pumping and make you hotter. Gentle motions can help the sweat on your skin evaporate, which helps lower your temperature. Dampening your skin with cool water while fanning yourself is also helpful."

      "title": "Try relaxation techniques to help lower your core temperature.",
      "content": "Try relaxation techniques to help lower your core temperature. Try sitting comfortably and taking slow, deep breaths. As you inhale, count to 4, then hold your breath as you count to 7, and exhale for an 8 count. Do your controlled breathing exercises for at least 10 to 15 minutes to reduce your heart rate and lower your core temperature. If it helps, put on some relaxing music or recordings of soothing nature sounds, like crashing waves or humpback whale songs. You could also give meditation a try. You can find guided meditations for relaxation on YouTube and other services. Relaxation techniques can help you cool off if you’re experiencing hot flashes."

      "content": "Take a tepid bath or sponge bath to lower your body temperature. If you want to reduce a fever , a lukewarm bath is better than a cold bath. Submerging yourself in cold water can cause shivering, which can increase your body temperature. If you don’t have access to a tub, try using a damp sponge, washcloth, or sheet. Having a fan blowing on you while you bathe or sponge yourself can also be effective."

      "title": "Drink small amounts of cool water frequently.",
      "content": "Drink small amounts of cool water frequently. Drinking water helps reduce high body temperature and replaces the liquid you lose by sweating. Drinking about 6 to 8 fluid ounces (180 to 240 mL) of water every 15 minutes is more effective than drinking a large amount in one sitting. Drink cool water instead of very cold water. If it’s too cold, it can cause stomach cramps or headaches .

Because of this, it can also help prevent heat exhaustion and heat stroke. [8] X Research source Keep in mind you still need to stay hydrated.
