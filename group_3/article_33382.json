First, take note of the 44 total food cards, which are decorated with different kinds of sandwich toppings, such as peanut butter, jelly, pickles, and eggs. Next, find the 3 thief cards and the 8 muncher cards, which are special action cards in the game. [1] X Research source Thief cards have a running child in a striped shirt and bandana on them. Muncher cards depict a child eating a sandwich, and also have numbers 1-3 in the top left corner."

While this isn’t a super important role, you’ll need a dealer to determine the order of gameplay later on. Don’t worry—the dealer only has to shuffle and distribute the cards at the beginning of the round. [2] X Research source Make sure you have at least 3 players before starting. You can play with up to 6 people. [3] X Research source"

As they receive their cards, make sure that all players keep their cards in a face-down pile in front of them. Place any extra cards face-up in the center of the table before starting gameplay.

Once any ingredient card is placed 2 times in a row, slap the pile before anyone else does. If you’re the first player to hit the center pile, then you get to keep all of the cards. Place those unshuffled cards face-down at the bottom of your pile. [6] X Research source This type of card combination works with any 2 cards in the deck, including thief and muncher cards.

Once you spot this card, be the first player to yell “Stop Thief!” before slapping the center pile. The first player to successfully yell this phrase and slap the center pile gets to keep the entire stack. If a player hits the center pile without yelling the proper catchphrase, then they don’t get to keep the cards.

To stop this from happening, have the player left of the muncher put down the number of cards specified on the muncher card. If these new discards create a Double Decker or Slamwich, then a different player (including the initial muncher) can claim the center deck by being the first one to slap the card stack. Thief cards also cancel out the effect of a muncher card. [10] X Research source Muncher and thief cards function the same way as regular ingredient cards. If the player left of the muncher happens to set down a #2 muncher card on top of a pre-existing #2 muncher card, then a Double Decker is created, and any player can slap it. If the next player puts down a muncher card with a different value, then the muncher gameplay shifts to the left. Now, the player left of the newest muncher discards the number of cards specified on the most recently placed muncher card."
