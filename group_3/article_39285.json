If you’re using a traditional safety razor or disposable razor, make sure it’s clean and relatively new. Use newer ones for your public areas, and use older ones for your armpits or other areas. [1] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Dermatology Professional organization made of over 20,000 certified dermatologists Go to source Dermatologists recommend changing blades or throwing out your disposable razor after 5-7 shaves. Never use a razor that’s full of gunk and hair, even if the blade is still sharp. If you get ingrown hairs, razor burn, or acne frequently, try using an electric shaver instead of a razor. You won’t get as close a shave, but it will be gentler on your skin."
