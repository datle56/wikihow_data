      "content": "Wear comfortable shoes that don’t put pressure on your toes. Corns result from pressure and friction on your toes, and tight or uncomfortable shoes can be one of the culprits behind their appearance. One of the most important things you can do to prevent corns from developing and to reduce the severity of any corns you may already have is to choose comfortable, well-fitting shoes. Choose shoes that are made from natural materials, such as leather and fleece, which allow for better moisture evaporation. Select shoes with fastenings like hook-and-loop fastener or laces so you can adjust them to fit your foot. Add a cushioning pad or insole to make your shoes more comfortable, if needed."

      "content": "File the thickened skin gently with a pumice stone. To remove some of the dead skin, gently scrub the corn with a pumice stone. Repeat the process regularly. Some experts suggest soaking your feet in warm water for 5-10 minutes to soften the skin before you file the corn."

      "title": "Try over-the-counter corn ointments or drops.",
      "content": "Try over-the-counter corn ointments or drops. Most over-the-counter treatments contain a minimal concentration of salicylic acid, which dissolves the keratin protein responsible for making up the corn and the thick, crusty layer of skin on top of it. [2] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Family Physicians Organization devoted to improving the health of patients, families, and communities Go to source Apply the product as directed on the label. One disadvantage of over-the-counter treatments is that the acids can also damage healthy skin as well as skin affected by corns, so if you use these treatments too readily, you may end up causing more damage than good. Acids should not be used by diabetics, those with impaired sensation, or those with thin skin. Always follow the instructions on the label when applying an ointment or other topical treatment."

      "content": "Use corn plasters to shrink the corns . These treatments stick on like an adhesive bandage, thereby cushioning the corn on your toes, but they also contain a small concentration of salicylic acid to treat the corn as it remains on. [3] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source The best corn plasters are ring-shaped. They provide cushioning to the corn while holding in enough moisture to keep the corn soft, thereby easing discomfort. Since many of these pads contain an acid treatment, you should not use them with other treatments. If you need to cover the corns after applying another treatment, make sure that you use a corn pad or plaster without salicylic acid in it or a plain adhesive bandage."

      "content": "Pad the corns to prevent irritation. While padding won’t help remove the corn, it can reduce the pain. Surround the corns with small pieces of moleskin or a donut-shaped adhesive pad. This can prevent the corns from rubbing on your shoes.

Professionally fitted shoe inserts can provide just the right amount of cushioning and protection for your feet, thereby helping corns on your toes to heal faster and preventing more corns from developing. You could use standard gel inserts purchased from the store, but customized inserts will be much more effective. Talk to a podiatrist about where and how to purchase prescription shoe inserts custom-fit for your foot."

Prescription remedies often use higher concentrations of salicylic acid than their over-the-counter counterparts, and some prescription remedies also use other, stronger combinations of acids to accomplish the same purpose.

While you should not shave or cut off a corn on your own, a professional foot doctor, or podiatrist, is often able to do so safely if the circumstances warrant it. [9] X Research source The podiatrist will remove the thickened, dead skin with a very sharp, thin blade. The procedure is painless and safe when done by a professional, and it can reduce overall discomfort while speeding up the healing process. Alternatively, a podiatrist might use ablative laser therapy to treat your corns. [10] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source"

[11] X Trustworthy Source DermNet NZ Online clinical resource website written and run by dermatologists providing evidence-based information about dermatology and skin health Go to source If other treatments haven’t helped, talk to a podiatrist to see if you’d be a good candidate for surgery. Corns can develop in between your toes when the bones in your toes grow at angles that cause the toes to naturally rub up against each other. Surgery can realign these bones, making them straighter and less likely to collide."
