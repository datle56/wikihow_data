      "title": "Oven",
      "content": "Oven Reheat the pulled pork in the oven if you have a huge amount. If your meat is frozen, arrange it in a single layer on a flat dish and let it thaw out on the counter or in the fridge before it goes in the oven. [1] X Research source Then, add a splash of apple juice or some BBQ sauce to the meat and mix it all together to keep it from drying out and transfer the meat to an oven-safe tray or pan. [2] X Research source Cover the meat in foil and put it in the oven at 250 °F (121 °C) for 30 minutes or until reaching an internal temperature of 165 °F (74 °C). For faster thawing, defrost the meat in the microwave or in the oven in low-medium heat. Add some water to keep it from drying out."

      "title": "Sous vide",
      "content": "Sous vide Boil your pork sous vide-style to heat it straight from frozen. Opt for this method if you stored your pork in a vacuum sealed bag (if you didn’t, just transfer it into one before boiling). Bring a pot of water to about 170 °F (77 °C), then turn off the burner. Place the bag in the water for about 45 minutes, then remove it. [3] X Research source Once the meat is heated, open the bag, add your preferred sauce, and enjoy! Most vacuum sealed bags for food storage are safe to boil, so don’t worry about any chemicals seeping into your food. Reheating this way takes a while, but it preserves the fresh, smoky flavor of the pulled pork better than other methods."

      "title": "Microwave",
      "content": "Microwave Use the microwave for the quickest and easiest reheating. First, thaw your meat on the counter or in the fridge if it’s frozen. Then, transfer it to a microwave-safe dish and add a splash or apple juice or BBQ sauce for moisture. Microwave on high in 1-2 minute intervals until the pork reaches an internal temperature of 165 °F (74 °C). [4] X Research source Use a food thermometer to check the pork’s temperature."

    {
      "title": "Stovetop",
      "content": "Stovetop Heat the pork in a Dutch oven on your stovetop to retain moisture. Thaw your pork if frozen, then place it in a Dutch oven or a large pot. Add as much leftover juice as you can, then cover with a lid. Set the burner to a medium heat and stir occasionally while the meat heats up. [5] X Research source Heat the leftover pulled pork until it reaches an internal temperature of about 165 °F (74 °C). Add additional juice, sauce, or apple juice to the pot for more moisture."
    },
    {
      "title": "Air fryer",
      "content": "Air fryer Use an air fryer to quickly reheat small batches of leftover pork. Thaw the pork if frozen, then load it into the air fryer and spread it evenly over the tray. Add just a few drops of water, juice, or sauce to help keep it moist, but not a lot since steam can damage your air fryer. [6] X Research source Fry for 5-6 minutes at 320 °F (160 °C), then drain any excess liquid. Add BBQ sauce if desired and fry for 1 more minute. Let the meat rest for 3-4 minutes before serving."

    {
      "title": "Instant pot",
      "content": "Instant pot Reheat your pulled pork in an instant pot to lock in moisture. Add a small amount of water to the pot (check the directions for your specific model) and place the trivet inside. Put your pork in a microwave-safe dish and place it on the trivet without covering it. Close the instant pot lid and steam the pork for about 5 minutes. [7] X Research source Open the lid and check for an internal temperature of 165 °F (74 °C). If it’s not warm enough, keep reheating in 2 minute intervals until it’s ready."

      "content": "Slow cooker Warm up your leftovers in a slow cooker to keep it juicy. Put your pork and all of its juice in your slow cooker or crock pot, put on the lid, and set the cooker to warm . Let the meat heat up for 2-4 hours (depending on how much is in there). Check for a temperature of 165 °F (74 °C) before serving. [8] X Research source Easily add other ingredients to the slow cooker if you plan on making a stew, soup, or chili with your leftover pulled pork."

    {
      "title": "Grill",
      "content": "Grill Grill your leftovers over indirect heat to prevent drying out. Heat one side of your grill so that there’s a very hot side and a cooler side that’s about 225 °F (107 °C). Then, mix sauce into your leftover pork and then wrap it in 2 layers of foil. Put the pork on the cool side of the grill and heat until it’s 165 °F (74 °C) (the indirect heat preserves moisture). [9] X Research source For enhanced texture, unwrap the meat and toss it with more sauce. Re-wrap it and put it on the hot (direct) side of the grill for 1-2 more minutes. Let the meat rest for 1-2 minutes before serving. If you’re using a pellet grill, reheat the pork the same way you would in the oven."

      "content": "Skim the fat out of the pork juice before storage. Strain the juice from the pork and let it sit on the counter until a fatty layer forms at the top (put the juice in the fridge to speed up the process). Use a spoon to scoop the fat away, or strain the juice again to separate the fatty layer. [10] X Research source Add the juice back to the meat for short term storage in the fridge, or keep it in a separate container if you plan on freezing the pork. Removing the fat allows you to keep the moisture in the pork while making it slightly healthier."

Fold the open edge closed, then run it through your sealer to create an airtight sack. The pork will last 3-4 days in the fridge, or 2-3 months in the freezer. [11] X Research source Use freezer bags with as much air pushed out of them as possible in a pinch. If you’re freezing the pork, store the juice or sauce in a separate container. The liquid can cause the pork to freeze in huge chunks which are hard to reheat. [12] X Research source"

Spoon the pork onto a sheet of foil and wrap it as tightly as possible, then pinch off the ends so no rogue meat can escape. If there’s very runny juice or sauce with the pork, store it in an airtight plastic container or a bag. [13] X Research source Foil isn’t airtight, so the chances of the pork going bad are higher.

Make sure the center of your pulled pork portion is piping hot each time you reheat it to prevent bacteria growth (check the temperature with a food thermometer to be extra sure).
