      "title": "Determine if you have a Hawley retainer.",
      "content": "Determine if you have a Hawley retainer. This is made of plastic and wires. The plastic piece is shaped to the inside of your mouth. The wires should fit around the front row of your teeth (usually the front six), with more wires in the back to hold it firmly in place over your back teeth.

      "title": "Hold the retainer properly.",
      "content": "Hold the retainer properly. You will need to know whether the retainer is for your top or bottom row of teeth. The plastic arch in the center should be pointing up or down toward the row of teeth it will hold in place. Make sure the metal strip is pointed away from your mouth."
    },
    {
      "title": "Place the retainer in your mouth.",
      "content": "Place the retainer in your mouth. Make sure it is close to the right row of teeth. Don't hold it there for a long time — this is a quick step to make sure you push it on all at once. Don't use too much force as you may hurt your gums if you didn't place it correctly. Check the position in a mirror while opening wide your mouth."

    {
      "title": "Push the retainer onto your teeth.",
      "content": "Push the retainer onto your teeth. Do this quickly after placing it in your mouth. Make sure the plastic arch fits perfectly into the roof or base of your mouth, that the wire in the front fits perfectly around your front teeth, and that the wires in the back fit around your back teeth. If your retainer does not fit properly, call your dentist or orthodontist, as it probably needs an adjustment. This could be either the wires around your teeth, or the plastic in your mouth.

    {
      "title": "Anchor the retainer firmly to your back teeth.",
      "content": "Anchor the retainer firmly to your back teeth. Use your fingers to push it into place if need be. Do not bite the retainer into place, as that may damage it. You should hear a click when it fits into place. If your retainer is falling out, or not staying in place, you may not have anchored it properly, or you may need to see your dentist or orthodontist to adjust the retainer."

      "title": "Determine if you have an Essix retainer.",
      "content": "Determine if you have an Essix retainer. This retainer is a clear plastic mold of your teeth, with no additional pieces or wires. It should cover the entire row of teeth (top or bottom). Because they are made only of thin plastic, Essix retainers may warp or bend, which makes them not fit properly. If your retainer used to fit, but no longer does, it may need to be fixed or replaced by your dentist. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Hold the retainer properly. You will need to know whether your retainer is for your top or bottom row of teeth. Make sure the arch points forward, and that the opening can be placed on the correct teeth."

      "content": "Push the retainer onto your teeth. Do this quickly after placing it in your mouth. The plastic should fit snugly over your whole row of teeth, and should not move. Make sure your retainer fits over all of your teeth, including in the back to hold it in place. If your retainer is falling out, or not staying in place, you may not have anchored it properly. Remember not to eat with the retainer placed, as you may break it or hurt your jaw."
