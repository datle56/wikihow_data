      "content": "This combination is special because Pluto is Scorpio’s ruling planet. It’s important to know that each astrological sign is ruled by a certain planet, and this planet greatly affects the astrological sign’s traits. Pluto is Scorpio’s ruling planet, so the two are extremely similar in many ways, such as being rather dark and mysterious.

As someone who’s personality is influenced by Scorpio, a person with Pluto in Scorpio might not shy away from being in a position of power and may even crave having such influence over others. However, the darker influences of Pluto can cause this need for control to turn into manipulation of others.

Such need for control can also make them very jealous and spiteful if they feel like they’re being threatened.
