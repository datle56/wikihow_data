Each number bid must be higher than the last (e.g. Player A bids 4, B bids 5, C bids 6). A bid of 21is known as shooting the moon, which is a bid to take all tricks. The bidding stops instantly at this point, and whoever bid 21 wins the auction. The winner of the auction (the one with the highest bid) takes the tile from the middle and then discards one tile from his hand face down without showing it."
