Fill it with water, use your hands to cover the openings, and shake the filter. Repeat until the water runs clear. [7] X Research source Dyson recommends using cold water, but other users have found that using warm (not hot) water is better at killing bacteria. However, using hot water to clean the filter can warp the seals. [8] X Research source Avoid using any detergents to clean the filter."

      "content": "Bacteria and water are the leading causes of odors. When you vacuum anything damp or slightly wet, moisture can enter the filter and cause bacteria to form, which can create a musty, mildewy, or wet dog smell. Vacuuming damp pet hair or reinstalling a filter before it's completely dry, for instance, can easily cause your Dyson filter to smell bad. [10] X Research source Additionally, debris, dust, and anything else that you vacuum up can cause an unpleasant smell. Using the vacuum frequently, using \"boost\" mode, and even the fact that Dyson vacuums are bagless can all contribute to an odor as the filter spins at a high speed like a centrifuge to separate the heavy dust particles without releasing them back into the air.

      "content": "Why does my Dyson filter smell like a wet dog? A wet dog smell in your Dyson vacuum filter may occur when water gets into the machine. This happens more for those who have a Dyson wet and dry vacuum. The dirty water that flows inside the vacuum is more likely to leave moisture behind. Regular cleaning your Dyson filter can help get rid of or at least keep the smell to a minimum. [18] X Research source"
