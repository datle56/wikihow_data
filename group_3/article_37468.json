Adding salt to your regular wash can help break up that buildup, making your clothes look like new again.

      "content": "Add 1/2 cup (150 g) of salt to the wash cycle. Once you've placed your clothes and detergent in the washing machine, pour about 1/2 cup (150 g) of salt into the drum. In addition to restoring colors, it can also help prevent new clothes from fading in the first place. [2] X Research source You can add salt to every load of laundry, if you'd like. Regular table salt or ultra-fine pickling salts work well for this, but avoid coarse-ground sea salt, as it may not dissolve fully in the washing machine. Salt is also an effective stain remover, especially on blood, mildew, and sweat stains. [3] X Research source"

If you have a top-loading machine, you can pour the vinegar directly into the drum, or you can add it to the fabric softener dispenser if you have a front-loading washer. The vinegar will help break up any detergent or minerals left behind by hard water, so your clothes will look brighter. [5] X Research source The vinegar will also prevent this buildup in the first place, so it’s a great way to keep your clothes color-fast while they’re still new. [6] X Research source If you want an even deeper clean, soak the clothing item in a solution of 1 cup (240 mL) of white vinegar and 1 gal (3.8 L) of warm water for about 20-30 minutes before you wash it."

In many cases, soaking your clothes in vinegar then washing them is all it will take to get them looking brighter. [7] X Research source Choose the cycle that’s appropriate for the clothes you’re brightening. For instance, if you’re washing items made from a delicate material like silk or lace, you’d want to use a gentle wash. For more durable fabrics like cotton or denim, a normal wash is fine."

The vinegar will wash out of your clothing during the rinse cycle, so your laundry shouldn’t smell like vinegar when it comes out of the wash. You can either hang the clothes to dry or place them in the dryer, depending on the instructions on the care label or how you normally prefer to dry your clothes. If a little of the smell does linger, either hang the item to dry outside or put a fabric softener sheet in the dryer. The smell should be gone by the time it's dry. If your clothes still look faded, the dye might have washed out, so you may need to dye the clothes instead."

Some fabrics accept dye better than others, so before you try to restore your clothing by dyeing it, take a look at the tag inside the item to see what it's made of. If the item is made from at least 60% natural fibers, like cotton , silk , linen, ramie, or wool, or if it’s made from rayon or nylon , it will probably dye well. [8] X Research source Clothing made from a blend of natural and synthetic fibers may not look as dark when they’re dyed as clothing made from an all-natural fabric. If the garment is made from acrylic, spandex, polyester, or metallic fibers, or if the tag says “Dry Clean Only,” it probably will not take dye well, if at all. If there are any spots or stains , the dye may not absorb evenly into the fabric, so make sure the clothes are clean."

Try to find the closest match you can, as this will give you the boldest, most natural-looking result.

In addition, have some old rags or paper towels nearby just in you need to quickly clean up any spills. Then, put on old clothes and thick gloves so your clothes and skin don’t get stained. [10] X Research source It’s important to protect your hands, because coming into contact with dye can irritate your skin."

Most household water heaters are set to a maximum temperature of 120 °F (49 °C), although some are set to 140 °F (60 °C), so the hottest water from your tap should be sufficient. However, if you want hotter water, you can heat it on the stove to just below boiling, or about 200 °F (93 °C). Pour the water into a large pot, bucket, or tub, or fill a top-loading machine with water on the hottest setting.

Generally, though, you’ll need about a 1/2 bottle of dye for every 1 lb (0.45 kg) of fabric. To help the dye set better, add 1/2 cup (150 g) of salt for every 1 lb (0.45 kg) of fabric you're dyeing. Stir the dye and salt into a small cup of warm water until they’re completely dissolved. Then, add the dye and salt mixture to your larger container of water and use a metal long-handled spoon or tongs to stir everything together.

Place the clothing into the dye bath and use your spoon or tongs to push them down under the water, ensuring they’re completely saturated. To help the dye soak evenly into the fabric, stir the clothing around at least every 5-10 minutes. That helps prevent any folds or bunches in the fabric from blocking the dye. [15] X Research source The more you stir, the more even the dye will be. Some people prefer to stir constantly, while others find it’s sufficient to just swish the clothing around every few minutes."

Even though you’ve already rinsed out much of the dye by hand, more will come out in the wash, so don’t put anything else in the washing machine, or it will get stained by dye as well.
