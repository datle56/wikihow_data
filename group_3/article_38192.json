      "content": "Know which languages are commonly spoken in each region. 65-75% of Swiss citizens speak Swiss-German, particularly throughout northern and central Switzerland. 20% speak French, and 4-7% are fluent in Italian. French and Italian are respectively most common along the borders with France (to the west) and Italy (to the south). Romansh is an ancient language, native to some southern regions, that is spoken by less than 1% of Swiss citizens. Bear in mind that many Swiss are multilingual. German is a good bet anywhere in the country, but you may be able to get by with French, Italian, or English regardless of the region."

The locals may be impressed if you make the effort to approach them using their native language, but you should be able to make your way around with English in most metropolitan areas. Bonus: the English \"Hello\" shares its roots with the German \"Hallo,\" so you might be briefly mistaken for German if you use the right tone. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Take your cues from the locals and think before you speak. Listen to the people around you. Before you speak to someone, listen carefully to hear him or her talk. If you are greeting a group, try to eavesdrop on their conversation before you jump in. You may even be able to pin down the pronunciation of certain words by listening to how the people around you say them. Look at signs, notices, and advertisements. If most of the public notices are written in German, then you should probably try speaking German. If most of the notices are written in French, then you should try speaking French. If you are preparing to meet someone for the first time, consider his or her name. If his name is Pierre, there's a good chance that he hails from a French-speaking region. If his name is Klaus, then it might be safe to assume that he speaks German."

If you are a woman greeting a female friend or a man greeting a woman, kiss them three times: offer first your right cheek, then your left, then your right again. These are not actual kisses, just air kisses. If you are a man greeting a male friend, stick with a handshake or man-hug. This format applies over much of the country, but certain regions (particularly those that border other countries) may have their own specific etiquette. [2] X Research source"

All the vowels in these words should be pronounced. If you see ue, üe or ie, for instance, you should pronounce the \"u\", the \"e\", and the \"i\" as distinct syllables. If you are writing, take note that all nouns in German are capitalized. [3] X Research source"

In most German-speaking areas, the word \"Grüetzi\" is equivalent to the English \"Hi.\" Phonetically, this sounds like \"Gryətsi\" or \"Groo-et-see\". You can also try \"Guten Tag\", in the standard German, which is easier to pronounce and remember. Consider these other informal greetings: [4] X Research source Hoi/Salü/Sali: \"Hi\", more informal than Grüetzi. \"Hoy\", \"Saloo\", \"Salee\". Hoi zäme: \"Hi\" to more than one person. \"Hoy zah-may\". Ciao (the same as the Italian \"Ciao\", pronounced \"chow\")"

In some areas, German-speakers use \"guetä Morgä,\" with the shortcut \"Morgä\" or \"Morge\" (differs from canton to canton). This is usually used until about noon. In some areas of Germany, it is only said until 10 a.m. \"Guetä Tag!\": \"Good day!\" Pronounced \"Goo-eh-ta togg\".

To put it in the perspective of a native English speaker, “ciao” is like “hi” while “salve” is closer to “hello.” [12] X Research source Like ciao, salve can also be used to say \"good-bye\" depending on the context."

About 48,000 of these speakers live in the southeastern district of Canton Graubünden. Most people who speak Rumantsch also speak Swiss-German and other languages, but locals may be impressed if you reach out to them in their native tongue. Romansh is also spelled as Romansh, Romantsch, Rhaeto-Romance, or Rheto-Romanic. About half of all native Rumantsch speakers have emigrated towards the industrialized cities of German speaking northern Switzerland. In this sense, Zurich has become the town with the most Rumantsch speakers. However, most Rumantsch-speaking city dwellers habitually speak German out of convenience. [14] X Research source The language comes from what \"vulgar Latin\" or \"people's Latin,\" with influences from Etruscan, Celtic, and other languages spoken by early settlers in the mountain valleys of what are now the Grisons and Italy's South Tirol. Romansh was included as a Swiss national language in 1938. Thus, base your pronunciations on Latin pronunciations."
