      "content": "Death and loss Commonly known as the “death flower” or “corpse flower,” the red spider lily has long been associated with death across many cultures, and especially so in Japan. In addition to many myths and folktales, the lily’s association with death may partially come from their short lifespans and the fact that they bloom in autumn rather than spring. [1] X Research source Red spider lilies bloom for about 2 weeks before they turn brown and die. They’re often planted in and around graves to deter wild animals from disturbing the site. Red spider lilies are poisonous, so scavengers tend to avoid them. These flowers may also be associated with death because their bright red color resembles that of blood. Folklore across many parts of East Asia, including Japan and China, associate the flower with death and the afterlife."

      "content": "In a Chinese tale, the flower originated with two elves. According to the legend, the ancient Chinese gods instructed two elves named Manju and Saka to guard the flower and its leaves respectively. Because both parts grew separately, the elves were fated to never meet. However, they defied the gods to meet, and when they were discovered, the gods punished them by separating them for eternity. This is why the leaves and the flowers of the red spider lily never grow at the same time. [6] X Research source Because of this tale, the red spider lily is also called the “Manjusaka” or “Manjushage.”"

The red spider lily’s association with death is especially prominent in Japan and is regularly used in music, film, and anime. The lily is extremely symbolic, and if you see it in your favorite anime, know it’s there for a reason—and that reason is usually to foreshadow an upcoming death. [10] X Research source For example, in Demon Slayer , red spider lilies are featured in the ending credits. The show is filled with death, so the lilies are more of a promise than just foreshadowing. In Tokyo Ghoul , the flowers make regular appearances throughout many different episodes. Here, red spider lilies also symbolize metamorphosis, as a field of white carnations transform into spider lilies as a character is tortured and his mind begins to break. In Dororo , the titular character Dororo encounters red spider lilies and has a flashback to when he became an orphan. Red spider lilies are also sometimes called “abandoned child flowers.”"

      "content": "Some roses, mums, and poppies also symbolize death. Depending on the location and culture, different flowers represent death and loss all over the world. Here are some common flowers associated with death and what they specifically mean: [12] X Research source Black roses: Black roses are actually a dark shade of purple or red that looks black. Since the color black is associated with sorrow and grief, these flowers symbolize death and loss. Chrysanthemums: In many European countries, these flowers are placed in tombs and symbolize death, whereas in America, they’re used to express a “get well soon” message. With these combined meanings, chrysanthemums are a symbol of support and mourning, making them a common flower for funerals. Red poppies: Poppies are a commemorative flower for war veterans, particularly those who died in one of the World Wars. Orchids: Orchids, especially pink and white ones, have traditionally been used to express sympathy and symbolize eternal love. Like carnations and chrysanthemums, they’re often a symbol of support during times of mourning. Marigolds: In some cultures, spirits are believed to be attracted to the scent of marigolds. Their bright colors also celebrate life, and they’re often used to decorate altars, crosses, and garlands. Carnations: Unlike other death flowers, carnations are associated with love, so they’re typically used to honor the memory of a loved one who has passed on and to symbolize an eternal bond."
