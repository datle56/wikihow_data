      "title": "The tattoo represents a murder.",
      "content": "The tattoo represents a murder. The most common explanation out there surrounding teardrop tattoos is that each teardrop represents a killing. So, in theory, someone with 3 teardrops has killed 3 people, 2 teardrops is 2 people, and so on. [1] X Research source The logic here is that the wearer of the tattoo is so hardcore and unemotional that they don’t even cry for the people they harm, so they have to get “fake” tears instead. Just to get this out of the way at the get-go, the vast majority of people with teardrop tattoos these days have not killed anyone. While this may have been a common practice decades ago, it’s no longer a universal meaning (and hasn’t been for some time)."

      "title": "The tattoo signifies time spent in prison.",
      "content": "The tattoo signifies time spent in prison. Another common explanation is that the teardrop is a symbol that someone spent time in prison for a crime they committed. [2] X Research source Some claim that each teardrop represents a year (or decade, depending on who you ask). This does seem to be a more common reason for someone to get a teardrop tattoo these days."

      "title": "The tattoo represents a loved one who died.",
      "content": "The tattoo represents a loved one who died. Some people believe that teardrops symbolize personal loss. In this sense, the teardrop tattoo reflects a kind of permanent pain caused by a serious personal loss. [3] X Research source There’s some evidence that the teardrop tattoo has also been used specifically as a sign that a prisoner had lost a loved one while they were locked up. Since they couldn’t attend the funeral, they honored them with the tear. [4] X Research source As a famous example, 6-time NBA all-star Amar’e Stoudemire got a teardrop tattoo to honor his brother who died in a car crash. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "The tattoo represents membership in a gang.",
      "content": "The tattoo represents membership in a gang. According to a lot of people, teardrop tattoos can symbolize membership in a criminal organization. Specifically, some people will claim the tattoo must be “earned” by the member–usually by committing some type of violent crime. [6] X Research source There is some anecdotal evidence that certain street gangs use tattoo teardrops to symbolize status or position in the gang, but it is by no means a universal meaning and most criminal organizations don’t put identical tattoos on their members’ faces."

      "title": "That tattoo reflects triumphs over personal struggles.",
      "content": "That tattoo reflects triumphs over personal struggles. For some people, the teardrop is a deeply personal symbol of growth and resilience. They may get one of these as an homage to their triumph over a difficult period in life. [7] X Research source Like the semicolon tattoo , some people associate the teardrop with success over mental health issues. This meaning may have been popularized by Amy Winehouse, who famously drew a teardrop tattoo on her face when her husband was admitted to a prison hospital (another prison connection!). [8] X Research source Lil Wayne got his two teardrop tattoos to symbolize personal loss. Many of his fans believe they’re supposed to honor friends or family who were killed. [9] X Research source"

      "title": "A teardrop under the left eye means something different than the right.",
      "content": "A teardrop under the left eye means something different than the right. Outside of some very fringe contexts, the eye the teardrop is underneath doesn’t mean anything. Some people will say the left eye represents murder while the right eye represents a person you know who was murdered or whatnot, but there’s very little evidence for any of this. [10] X Research source These theories may come from Chicago’s old gang scene. There were two large organizations in Chicago with different gangs on each side. One would wear hats pointed to the left, others would wear hats pointed to the right, so you can imagine how the side of something like a teardrop tattoo might have mattered. [11] X Research source"

      "content": "The outline of a teardrop means something different than a solid one. Some people believe that whether the teardrop is filled in or not determines whether it was a murder or attempted murder. Others say the fill/outline determines someone’s rank in a gang (it gets filled in when they are “promoted”). We can’t find any real evidence for this practice. [12] X Research source"

      "content": "Like any tattoo, the significance differs from person to person. There is no hidden secret code for tattoos that applies to all people. One person’s motivation for getting a teardrop can be totally different from another person’s. That’s kind of the beauty of tattoos! You get to choose the meaning and value of the designs you put on your body. [13] X Research source The idea that a teardrop tattoo represents murder or loss or gang affiliation or anything like that may have had a lot of truth to it years ago, but if you make any assumptions like that today you’re very likely to be wrong. Sure, there are some historical connections to prison life, but those connections are no longer as concrete as they once were. Teardrop tattoos have worked their way through every element of the cultural imagination to the point that high-end fashionistas and designers are now intrigued by face and neck tattoos!

      "content": "The earliest mention of a teardrop tattoo comes from the 1970s. Apparently, the first reference to a teardrop tattoo in the historical record comes from a New Yorker article about a Latino gang member. [15] X Research source We can’t find the original article to confirm it, but it was reported that the tattoo symbolized grief and sorrow for the prisoner. There’s no doubt that the practice of getting a tattoo teardrop almost certainly goes back further, but there’s no historical record to prove it."

      "content": "A court case in Canada likely helped spread the murder theory. In 2004, a man from Toronto named Warren Abbey was arrested for murder. [16] X Research source He had a tattoo teardrop and an expert witness for the prosecution gave some very compelling (and wrong) testimony that the tattoo was a sign that Abbey was in a rival gang. This was a huge deal at the time. In fact, Abbey was eventually awarded a new trial just because the “expert” was proven to have been bending the truth a bit. [17] X Research source The expert witness claimed to be basing their opinion on academic studies about youth violence, but none of the studies they cited actually proved teardrop tattoos were linked to gang membership."

      "content": "The movie Cry-Baby may have popularized the teardrop in the American imagination. The teardrop tattoo wasn’t a particularly common or notable image in American culture until the mid-90s and early aughts. Johnny Depp’s character in the 1990 film Cry-Baby had one of these tattoos, and it’s possible that this brought the idea of the teardrop as a prison tattoo to the zeitgeist. [18] X Research source In the film, the titular Cry-Baby gets a teardrop tattoo from another prison inmate. He dedicates the tattoo to the film’s love interest."
