[1] X Research source Avoid metal bowls—they can oxidise the dye. Place an old towel or newspaper under the bowl to protect your work surface. Place another towel over your shoulders to protect your clothes. Finally, put on latex or plastic gloves to protect your skin from the chemicals. [2] X Research source “Always make sure you are fully prepared with gloves, a bowl, a brush, enough product to cover the whole head, and time to work,” says professional hair stylist Gina Almona. [3] X Expert Source Gina Almona Professional Hair Stylist Expert Interview. 12 Feb 2021. If you dye your hair regularly, having a dedicated bowl is best. You won’t be able to eat out of the bowl after using it to mix dye, as chemicals may linger."

      "content": "Combine the hair dye and developer using a 1:1 or 1:2 ratio. Check your hair dye package to learn the exact ratio of hair dye to developer to use. Some box dyes come with developer pre-mixed in. Others include the proper amounts of dye and developer in the package. [4] X Research source Mix them with a plastic or rubber utensil, not a metal one, as metal oxidizes the dye. [5] X Research source If you buy the dye and developer separately, you will have to measure them out yourself. Use a small digital scale to get the proper amounts of each. Developer activates your hair dye so the color can adhere to your hair. Generally, use a lower-number volume developer (20 vol.) for going one shade up or down, and higher-number developers (30 or 40 vol.) for going two to three or four shades lighter."

      "title": "Choose a primary color that’s close to the color you want.",
      "content": "Choose a primary color that’s close to the color you want. The primary color or base shade is the main color you’re trying to dye your hair to be. For example, if your goal is to combine red and blonde hair colors to become strawberry blonde, your primary color would be blonde. [6] X Research source Pick two colors from the same brand. Different brands have different formulas and developer ratios, so mixing two box dyes from the same brand is the way to go. Mix two semi-permanent or two permanent dyes. While you could use a permanent and a semi-permanent dye together, it’s harder to predict how it will look when mixed and as it fades. Stick to dyes that are as similar as possible."

      "title": "Pick a secondary color based on the effect you want to achieve.",
      "content": "Pick a secondary color based on the effect you want to achieve. If you’re trying to darken the base color, choose a secondary color that’s darker than it, and vice versa if you’re looking to lighten. If you want a cool look, use an ash shade for your secondary color. For warmth, go for a golden or coppery shade. [7] X Research source Don’t mix warm and cool colors together. They can muddy one another, resulting in a dull look. Complementary colors work well together, such as a red shade and a brown shade. Avoid mixing contrasting or opposite shades , such as blonde and black. Simply want to neutralize the primary color? Choose a natural secondary color that has a balance of warm and cool tones, usually denoted with an N or NN on the dye box."

      "content": "Take note of the hair color numbers of both dyes. The first number is the dye’s base color, which is based on a natural color, explains master stylist and colorist Christine George. [8] X Expert Source Christine George Master Hair Stylist & Colorist Expert Interview. 10 Jan 2020. The higher the number, the lighter the color. The second number (or letter) after the period refers to the tone—either cool, warm, or ash. [9] X Research source For the first number, usually 1 is black, 2 is darkest brown, 3 is dark brown, 4 is medium brown, 5 is light brown, 6 is dark blonde, 7 is blonde, 8 is light blonde, 9 is very light blonde, and 10 is lightest blonde. Consult the brand’s hair color chart if you’re unsure. For the second number, usually .0 is no tone, .1 is blue, .2 is violet, .3 is gold, .4 is copper, .5 is mahogany, .6 is red, .7 is green, and .8 and .9 are ash tones. [10] X Research source Try to keep the two hair dye colors within the same two to three shades. For example, your primary color may be a 6.7, so choose a secondary color that’s a 5.7 or 4.7."

      "title": "Combine a 1:1 ratio of the two hair dyes together.",
      "content": "Combine a 1:1 ratio of the two hair dyes together. Use the exact same amount of each shade. This will ensure that the color is uniform throughout your hair. Always wear plastic or latex gloves and protect the area under your mixing bowl with an old towel. Mix in a plastic or glass bowl with a plastic fork or a rubber whisk—avoid metal bowls or utensils. [11] X Research source Using a 1:1 ratio of the 2 colors also means that you can easily replicate the color later if needed, such as if you want to dye your roots at a later stage. Use a small set of scales to weigh out the amounts if you aren't using a full unit of product. If you want to mix your dyes in a different ratio, write down the formula you create so that it's easy to replicate. This will be especially helpful when you want to touch up your roots!"

      "content": "Follow the boxes’ dye and developer mixing ratio. Combining two hair colors together doubles the amount of hair dye that you have if you’re using full individual units of each dye. Calculate the right amount of developer to mix with this amount. Check each dye’s box for the ratio of developer to dye and add them together. For example, if the ratio of hair dye to developer on each box is 1:1, and you used two units of dye, you need to use double the developer to make it 1:1. If you bought boxed hair dye, then your developer is likely already included in the box. You shouldn't need to purchase it separately. Check the product label to see if it's included in your kit. If you’re using semi-permanent dye, you don’t need developer, says professional hair stylist Courtney Foster. She suggests that it’s ideal for boosting your natural hair color and shine.

      "content": "Write down the color combination after you have dyed your hair. Include the brand, color name, and color number that’s written on both dye boxes. Also, write down the developer you used and the quantities you used for each product. This way, you can easily replicate the mixture in the future if you want to dye your hair the same color, or if you need to touch up the roots. Even if you weren't happy with the final look of your mixed hair dye, writing it down will ensure that you don't accidentally repeat the combination in the future."
