      "content": "Split 4 players into teams of 2. Spades is traditionally played with 4 players. Gather a few friends and split into teams of 2, with teammates on opposite sides of the table. If you have extra players, play a tournament and have the winning team meet new opponents for each new game. [1] X Research source If you’re playing with 2 people, go 1-on-1 instead of forming teams."

      "content": "Agree to play to either 200 or 500 points. Before starting the game, decide whether you want to play a full-length game or a shorter game. A full-length game of Spades has teams competing to be the first to reach 500 points. A shorter game only goes to 200 points. [2] X Research source Optionally, extend or shorten a game by adding or subtracting the total needed points in increments of 100."

      "content": "Remove the jokers from your deck and deal 13 cards to each player. Spades is played with a standard playing deck of 52 cards, with the jokers set aside. Shuffle the deck and deal all the cards face down, starting with the player on the dealer’s left, and distributing the entire deck clockwise among the players. [3] X Research source It doesn’t matter who begins as the dealer, so choose at random or play rock, paper, scissors to determine the first dealer. Wait until all the cards have been dealt to pick your cards off the table. To play with only 2 players, place the deck face down on the table and take turns drawing a card off the top, until both players have 13 cards. You may discard a card you draw, but must place the next card into your hand. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Give everyone a few moments to organize their cards. After all the cards are dealt, allow for a few moments for players to look over their hands. Take the opportunity to assess how good your cards are and organize them as you wish. During this time, players double-check how many cards they have to ensure they have 13 cards each. [5] X Research source Arrange your cards by suit and rank in ascending order to help you assess your hand. In spades, the cards are ranked from highest to lowest in this order: A, K, Q, J, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2. Keep your cards a secret, even from your teammate."

      "title": "Examine your hand for high cards or spades, which can win tricks.",
      "content": "Examine your hand for high cards or spades, which can win tricks. A “trick” is the pot of cards players add to the center of the table, which each player wants to obtain for themselves by playing the highest card. As a general rule, a hand with higher cards has the potential to win the most tricks. Examine your hand and form a rough guess about how it might stack up against the other players’ hands [6] X Research source Cards in the spades suit “trump” or are worth more than cards of other suits, so a hand with many spades is generally a good hand. You have a very good hand if you have high cards (A, K, Q, J) that are spades."

      "title": "Make a contract bid with your teammate without revealing your hand.",
      "content": "Make a contract bid with your teammate without revealing your hand. Starting with the player to the dealer’s left, each player makes a “bid,” or a prediction of how many tricks they’ll win that round. Every round has 13 tricks, so bid between 0 and 13—if you have many high cards, bid higher, like 8 or more; if you have mostly low cards, bid low, like 2-6. Teammates then add their individual bids together to find the minimum number of tricks they need to win that round. [7] X Research source Don’t reveal your specific cards or their suits to anyone at the table (which is against the rules), only your confidence in them! Bidding “nil” means you don’t expect to win any tricks. If you succeed, your team earns an additional 100 points. If you’re playing with 2 players, simply make your own individual bid—this will be your target for the round."

Other players must play a card of the same suit in ascending order. If you do not have a card of the same suit to play, discard any card from a different suit—the next player must still play a card of the starting suit, if they can. [8] X Research source If you don’t have a card matching the played suit when it’s your turn, you may “break spades” and play a spade, instead. After spades have been broken for the first time in a round, other players may start the next tricks with a spade. A player can start the trick with a spade if they have no other suits in their hand. For example, if player 1 leads with the 7 of clubs, each other player, if possible, must put down a club higher than 7 this round."

When you win a trick, take all 4 cards from that round and set them aside to score after the round. [9] X Research source Each time you win the trick, set those 4 cards next to you in their own stack so that yourself and the other players can keep track of how many tricks you’ve won. If a spade was played, then the highest spade on the table wins, regardless of the starting suit. Note that you must play a card of the starting suit if possible, and may only play a spade if you don’t have a card of that suit in your hand. Discarding a card from a different suit will not win the trick."

If you’re team didn’t meet its bid, you simply win 0 points this round. [11] X Research source For example, if you and your partner bid 6 tricks and successfully won 8 total tricks, your score is 6 x 10 (for each trick in your bid), then +2 for the additional tricks, for a score of 62 points that round. Announce every player’s score after tallying so that everyone knows the current ranking."
