If you give your child a dose of acetaminophen or ibuprofen, do not also give them cough medicine or any other type of other medicine without consulting your doctor first. Certain medicines interact with each other in ways that can harm your child's health. [8] X Research source For infants over 6 months, children, and adults, alternating between acetaminophen and ibuprofen is safe. Usual dosages are acetaminophen every 4-6 hours and ibuprofen every 6-8 hours, depending on the dose."

Keeping your body hydrated is important during a fever, since the increased body temperature can cause dehydration. [12] X Research source Drinking water and other fluids helps your body expel the virus or bacteria that's causing the fever. However, you should avoid caffeine and alcohol because these can lead to further dehydration. Green tea may help reduce a fever and boost your immune system. If you are experiencing nausea or vomiting along with the fever, avoid fruit juices, milk, very sugary beverages and carbonated beverages. These drinks can make you feel sick or cause vomiting. [13] X Research source Try replacing solid food with soup or broth to help rehydrate your body (but watch the salt content). Popsicles are also a great way to consume fluids that will also help cool your body down. If you have been vomiting, you may have an electrolyte imbalance. Drink an oral rehydration solution or a sports drink with electrolytes. [14] X Research source [15] X Research source Children under age one who do not regularly consume breast milk or who are on a nursing strike during an illness should take a rehydration solution containing electrolytes, such as Pedialyte, to make sure they're getting the nutrients they need.

Take the day off of work, or if your child is sick, have him or her stay home from school. The extra sleep your child will get is a sure way to a quicker recovery, and the source of the fever might be contagious, so it’s best to keep her home.

Andrographis paniculata is widely used in traditional Chinese Medicine to treat colds, sore throats, and fevers. Use 6 g a day for 7 days. Do not use andrographis if you have gallbladder or an autoimmune disease, are pregnant or trying to become pregnant, or take blood pressure or blood thinning medications such as warfarin. Yarrow may help reduce fevers by encouraging sweating. If you have ragweed or daisy allergies, you may experience an allergic reaction to yarrow. Do not take yarrow if you also take blood thinning or blood pressure medications, lithium, stomach acid reducers, or anticonvulsants. Children and pregnant women should not use yarrow. You may find that adding yarrow tincture to a warm (not hot) bath helps reduce fever. [23] X Research source Despite its name, feverfew doesn’t actually work very well to reduce fevers."

If you do want to have a bath, the only appropriate temperature is lukewarm, or just above room temperature. [25] X Research source If your child has a fever, you can bathe him or her with a sponge dipped in lukewarm water. Gently wash your child's body, pat him or her dry with a soft towel, and dress your child quickly so he or she doesn't get too chilled, which can lead to shivering, which heats up the body."

      "content": "Select a thermometer. There are several different types of thermometers, including digital and glass (mercury) models. [29] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source The most common way to take a temperature for an older child or an adult is to place a digital or glass thermometer underneath your tongue to measure your body’s heat, but there are several other thermometers that use alternate methods for temperature taking. Digital thermometers can be used orally or rectally (see below) or under the armpit (though this reduces the accuracy of the reading). The thermometer will beep when the reading is complete, and the temperature displays on a screen. Tympanic thermometers are used inside the ear canal, and they measure temperature with an infrared light. The downside to this style of thermometer is that a buildup of earwax or the shape of an ear canal can skew the accuracy of the reading. Temporal thermometers use an infrared light to measure the temperature. These thermometers are great because they are quick and least invasive. To use this type of thermometer, you slide the thermometer from the forehead to the temporal artery, right above the top of the cheekbone. It can be difficult to master proper placement, but taking several readings can improve the accuracy of the reading. Pacifier thermometers can be used for babies. These are similar to oral digital thermometers, but perfect for babies who use pacifiers. The peak reading is displayed when the temperature is measured."

The most accurate way to take a child’s temperature is through her rectum, but you should use extreme caution so that you do not perforate the child’s bowel. The best thermometer for rectal temperatures is a digital thermometer. Place a small amount of petroleum jelly or ky jelly on the thermometer probe. Lay your child on her stomach. Get another person to help if necessary. Carefully insert the probe one-half inch to one inch into the anus. Hold the thermometer and child still for about one minute, until you hear a beep. Do not let go of your child or the thermometer to avoid injury. Remove the thermometer and interpret the reading on the screen."

Fevers are produced by the body as a sign that there's another issue going on, so making it go away can mask a deeper problem. Aggressively treating a fever can also interfere with your body's natural method of getting rid of a virus or infection. A lower body temperature might produce a more habitable environment for foreign bodies, so it can be better to let the fever run its course.
