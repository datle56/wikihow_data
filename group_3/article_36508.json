      "title": "Fill a container with 1 cup of sugar.",
      "content": "Fill a container with 1 cup of sugar. Utilize a container that has a capacity of at least 1.5 cups. Use regular, white granulated table sugar rather than other types of sugar, such as brown sugar or pure cane sugar. Regular, white granulated table sugar is a bit more abrasive and will make for a better scrub. Salt can be substituted for sugar, as some people prefer to use 1 cup of salt rather than sugar when making this scrub. If you prefer to use salt, use Epsom salt or kosher salt."

      "title": "Add avocado oil to the sugar in your container.",
      "content": "Add avocado oil to the sugar in your container. Keep adding avocado oil until you attain the consistency of the scrub that you desire. 1/2 cup of avocado oil is a good starting point, and the more avocado oil you add, the thinner your scrub will become. If you do not have avocado oil, you can use dish soap as a substitute. You can use your favorite dish soap, and it does not have to be any particular brand. Less dish soap will make the scrub a thicker consistency. More dish soap will make the scrub a thinner consistency."

      "title": "Add lemon juice to the mixture.",
      "content": "Add lemon juice to the mixture. You can add either 1.5 tablespoons (22.2 ml) of lemon juice or the juice from 1/2 a lemon. Lemon is not only an effective cleaner and exfoliator, but it's also a good deodorizer. Optionally, you can also add lemon essential oil to the mixture. Use 4 or 5 drops of lemon essential oil. The lemon essential oil adds extra grease cutting and antiseptic properties, while also softening the skin."
