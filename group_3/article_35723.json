Insert a push pin into the hole, flip the lighter so the pin is resting against your work surface, and press down on the lighter firmly. [1] X Research source You should feel and hear a small \"pop\" as the pin pushes a metal beebee out of place. This beebee seals the release valve and must be pushed out of the way. To ensure the beebee seal has been removed, shake the lighter with the push pin still inserted. You should be able to hear the beebee rattle around."

You should hear a puff of air when the pin pulls free. Attempting to purge a lighter that has fuel remaining inside will cause fuel to be sprayed out of the refill valve. To prevent fuel from getting on your work surface, lay down a cover, like newspaper or a drop cloth. Wipe down any areas exposed to fuel with a water-dampened rag. Also, your hands may have gotten fuel on them. Wash them with soapy water."

Your butane applicator may not fit perfectly into the lighter’s refill valve, which can cause gas to leak. To prevent leaks, slip three rubber grommets that fit snugly onto the applicator. [2] X Research source The rubber of the final grommet should extend just slightly beyond the tip of the butane spray applicator. Circular rubber grommets can be purchased at your local hardware store in variety packs in the hardware section. [3] X Research source"

Insert the grommet-covered tip of the applicator into the refill valve. Press down on the bottle to disengage the refill bottle's release valve. [4] X Research source Because of the seal formed by the rubber grommets, you shouldn't hear any noise as the lighter refills. The lighter should be full in about five seconds.

[6] X Research source You may hear some hissing when your thumb is plugging the refill valve. Hold your thumb firmly to reduce the escape of fuel. This part of refilling a disposable lighter can be difficult at first. Move quickly to prevent freshly replenished fuel from escaping. [7] X Research source"

Look for bottles that come with metal tips instead of plastic ones. Metal tips are better for inserting the butane into the lighter. Verify the butane works with your lighter by reading its label instructions. Always follow the safety directions on the canister to achieve the best results.

Good ventilation will prevent the buildup of harmful fumes. Your kitchen or an outside area are good places to refill your butane lighter because both are open spaces. Open a window or turn on a vent in the room if it is available. If airflow is still poor even with a window open, use a stationary fan to improve circulation. Remaining fluid or gas may spray onto your work surface while refilling. Protect your work surface with a layer of newspaper or a drop cloth. [16] X Research source"

[17] X Research source The air will be fully released when you no longer hear a hissing sound. [18] X Research source The refill lever is also known as the nipple. It is located on the bottom of most butane lighters and usually looks like a small hole with a tiny, circular valve inside. If you don't have a screwdriver, use a pen, paperclip, or similar tool to push down the valve and release the remaining air in the lighter. If lighter fluid sprays onto your hands or tools, rinse these thoroughly in soap and water. If you forget to do so, the fuel may ignite and burn you when you test the lighter."

Use a small flathead screwdriver and turn the screw clockwise to lower the flame.

By shaking the can, you'll prime it for refilling. While shaking the can, you'll also be able to feel fluid swish around inside it. This will give you a chance to gauge how much is in the bottle. Nearly empty bottles may not have enough fluid to fully refill your lighter and should be swapped out for a new can of replacement fuel. [21] X Research source"

In some cases, the bottle tip may not form a secure fit with the lighter's valve. In this situation, use a tip adapter. [22] X Research source Most butane refill bottles come with an adapter, so before you try to refill, make sure the standard tip fits over the valve. Don’t fill the lighter at an angle. This will let air into the lighter tank. Air in the lighter will cause the lighter to not work properly. It will have to be drained and refilled. [23] X Research source"

Press down on the lighter firmly for about five seconds to refill the lighter. After refilling, let your lighter sit for about five minutes to reach room temperature before using it. [24] X Research source After filling, if you feel like your lighter isn’t full, repeat this procedure for another five seconds. Refill cans low on fuel may take more time to refuel lighters. Some lighters have a fuel level that you can check. Check the butane level viewer if you have one to gauge the lighter's fullness. Lighters that are filled up too much will overflow. This can be dangerous, as butane can leak and catch fire when lighting."

Before attempting to test the lighter, let the butane settle for a few minutes. [25] X Research source Once you’ve refilled and set your flame height, give your lighter a minute or so to absorb the butane. As you wait for butane to be absorbed, check your lighter for leaks. Wipe up leaked fuel with a dampened rag. Rinse the rag frequently. If your lighter leaks, you may have to purge the fuel and refill it again. Check for obvious culprits first, like loose fasteners, before purging and refilling. [26] X Research source"

In most butane lighters, butane won't dissolve over time. Always test your lighter before refilling it to make sure that it is empty."

Other brands of lighter fluid intended for similar lighters will work most of the time, but the Zippo fluid is recommended by the manufacturer for maintaining its condition and operation. [27] X Research source If you use a different brand of lighter fluid, make sure it is a premium brand. Sub-par fuel may fail to ignite in your lighter. Never use charcoal lighter fluid.
