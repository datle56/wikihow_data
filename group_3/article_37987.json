They don’t have brains and instead use a “nerve ring” to regulate their body functions. They’re protected by an exoskeleton, and internally, have a jaw that contains five teeth-like sections, 50 calcified skeletal elements, and 60 muscles. [7] X Research source Sand dollars are an important part of the ocean’s ecosystem, as they help control the population of smaller invertebrates and are a source of food for some larger organisms. Sand dollars also have a star-shaped pattern on their bodies, which is one of the reasons people like to collect them. When sand dollars reproduce, fertilization occurs externally, leading to the development of free-swimming larvae. The larvae eventually settle on the ocean floor, undergo metamorphosis, and transform into young sand dollars."
