      "content": "Put on white or black robes and prepare your altar. An altar isn’t necessary, but if you have one, place it in the center of the room. If you have one, light a white candle on the altar to represent purity and energy. Also place on the altar a cup of water, a small pile of salt, an unlit match, and a feather, which represent the four elements of water, earth, fire, and air, respectively. [1] X Research source Traditionally, these objects are actually a wand, a cup, a dagger, and a pentacle, but these aren’t always easy to obtain."
