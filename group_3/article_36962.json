      "content": "Clip away the bottom stop from the end of the zipper. Look for a thin, metal bar along the very bottom of the zipper. Grab a pair of nippers or pliers and cut off this stop—you need to remove it completely so you can separate both sides of the zipper. [1] X Research source You’ll need to separate the zipper to make the repair. Nippers are a chunky, plier-like tool that help you make small adjustments."

      "content": "Slip the slider off the zipper completely. Grab the zipper tab and guide the slider down off the teeth. Don’t worry—since you’ve already removed the bottom stop, you can pull off the slider completely. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Feed the zipper tape through the right side of the slider. Take the top right portion of the zipper tape and thread it through the right side of the zipper slider. It may take a few tries before the material goes through the zipper, so don’t be discouraged! [3] X Research source Zipper tape is the material that the zipper teeth are attached to."

      "content": "Thread the other zipper tape through the left side. Repeat the same process with the left portion of the zipper, feeding the tape through the left part of the slider. At this point, your slider should be at the very top of the zipper teeth. [4] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Tug both sections of zipper tape apart.",
      "content": "Tug both sections of zipper tape apart. This next part can be a little tricky—in order to thread the slider back on the zipper tape, you’ll need to create some opposing force. That’s where the ends of the zipper tape come in! Pull apart both ends of the tape, creating a “V” shape. [5] X Research source You’ll need a free hand to pull on the actual zipper slider. If you can, try to pull apart both sides of the zipper tape with 1 hand."

      "title": "Pull the slider toward you as you continue pulling the zipper tape in opposite directions.",
      "content": "Pull the slider toward you as you continue pulling the zipper tape in opposite directions. Hold the end sections of zipper tape apart with 1 hand while gripping the zipper tab with your free hand. Give the tab a good tug to force the slider back onto the zipper. [6] X Research source Pull the zipper tape in opposite directions and pull on the zipper again if it doesn’t feed back onto the teeth. It may take several tries before this works!"

      "content": "Create a new bottom stop by melting the bottom-most zipper teeth with a soldering iron. Zip up your zipper so both rows are touching one another. Then, grab your soldering iron and melt a small section along the bottom of your zipper, which will act as the new bottom stop. You’re now able to use your zipper as normal again!

      "content": "Clip off the top stop and nearby teeth from your zipper. Search along the top of your zipper for a thin, metal bar—this is known as a top stop, and it helps keep your slider from slipping off completely. Grab a set of nippers or pliers and remove this top stop, along with a couple of teeth on each side of the zipper. This will make it easier for you to reattach and repair your invisible zipper.

At this point, the zipper should thread back onto the teeth. [12] X Research source Pull both sections of tape apart and tug on the zipper tab a few more times if the slider doesn’t reattach at first. Invisible zippers can be finicky, so don’t give up!"

This will replace the metal stop that you clipped off in the very beginning. Now, you’re ready to use your invisible zipper again! [13] X Research source It’s okay if the soldered section doesn’t look great. Since it’s an invisible zipper, no one will be able to see it!"
