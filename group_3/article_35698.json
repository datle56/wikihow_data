Corporations that allow industrial waste to seep into waterways are the biggest culprits of water pollution. There are regulations to prevent this from occurring, but it's still a common occurrence. Find out if there's a certain factory or energy plant in your area responsible for polluting local waterways, and speak up about the problem.

Look into the policies at your workplace or school and find out if there are changes you could help create a pollution-free environment. Kellogg emphasizes that involving classmates, teachers, and coworkers is a great way to educate others and make a difference.

For example, you could recommend that your office or school switch to eco-friendly cleaning supplies and make suggestions as to which ones work well. You could also put up signs reminding people to conserve water in the bathroom and kitchen areas, like reminders to never leave the sink running."

So, switch to natural cleaners and cleaning methods to lessen the amount of toxins and pollutants you use. [5] X Trustworthy Source United States Environmental Protection Agency Independent U.S. government agency responsible for promoting safe environmental practices Go to source Common household supplies like white vinegar and baking soda can be used for everything (from washing windows to scrubbing bathroom tiles), and they’re completely non-toxic. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) provides a list of cleaning products (as well as a variety of other products) that are considered “green,” meaning they won't pollute the water supply. So, use it as your guide to environmentally friendly cleaning!"

Treating water so it's clean enough to drink and use around the house requires a lot of energy, so it's important to conserve as much as possible, especially in areas where droughts are occurring. Adopt the following habits to conserve more water around your home: [10] X Research source Take showers instead of baths, as showers use less water. Replace shower heads with water-efficient shower heads designed to use less water. [11] X Expert Source Kathryn Kellogg Sustainability Specialist Expert Interview. 15 November 2019. Turn off your faucets when you’re not using water, such as when brushing your teeth. Avoid overwatering your lawn to save water. Use a broom instead of water to clean your driveway. Water your garden before the sun comes up or after it sets, as you’ll have to use more water during the hottest times of the day.

The Great Pacific Garbage Patch, for example, is a huge vortex of trash, mainly plastic, that has collected in the ocean. [13] X Research source This trash endangers marine life and contaminates human drinking water. Whenever possible, use glass or cloth containers instead of plastic. Using a reusable glass container to store your leftovers, investing in cloth napkins , or shopping with a reusable bag are small changes that can make a big difference.

Contaminated groundwater can have a negative effect on the environment as well as the people who depend on it. Groundwater makes up 51% of the US’s drinking water and 64% of the irrigated water used to water crops. [15] X Research source So, if the groundwater is contaminated, the drinking water and crops will likely be too. Switch to natural methods for getting rid of pests and weeds to help protect groundwater reserves. [16] X Research source Look into organic gardening practices to find creative ways to deal with garden pests. For example, many pests can be dealt with using a simple dish soap and water solution. Planting native species can also help, as native species have developed a resistance to the pests and weeds in the area. Species native to other lands are more susceptible to disease as well."

When soil gets eroded and ends up in streams, rivers, and other waterways, chemicals that exist in the soil mix with the water and create problems for plant and animal life. For example, when phosphorus levels get too high in a body of water, they lead to algae blooms that can kill fish populations. The plants' roots hold the soil in place and keep it from falling into the water, so preventing erosion helps protect wildlife.

Even if the waste doesn't contain chemicals such as herbicides and pesticides, large quantities of sticks, leaves, and grass clippings can overwhelm waterways with unhealthy quantities of nutrients. [22] X Research source Contain your compost in a bin or barrel to prevent the materials from being washed away. Use a mulching mower instead of bagging grass clippings. Mulching mowers add a natural layer of compost to your lawn without needing to dispose of grass clippings.

Without a clean source, some organisms essential to the ecosystem cannot thrive. Polluted water disrupts the food chain and limits local biodiversity. [27] X Trustworthy Source National Resources Defence Council Multinational environmental advocacy group focused on grassroots activism and legislative action Go to source For instance, say a lake is polluted. The contaminant may cause the lake’s ecosystem to produce more algae and phytoplankton, which then reduces water quality. Because of the changing water quality, fish can die, and if the fish die, the birds that eat the fish will either die or try to travel somewhere else for food (which will then disrupt the flow of another established ecosystem)."
