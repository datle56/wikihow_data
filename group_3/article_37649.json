      "content": "Create a playlist of everything you want to rip in Spotify. Because it's not possible to rip from Spotify short of manually recording as songs play, the easiest way to rip songs is to convert your Spotify playlist into a YouTube playlist and then download the music from there. Open the Spotify website and log in with your account. Create a new playlist and label it something like \"YouTube\" or \"Convert\" (so you can easily recognize it). Add all of the music that you want to rip to the playlist. You may have difficulty matching obscure tracks if the song is not on YouTube, but most songs should match without issue."
