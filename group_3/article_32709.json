A great line can help give you confidence because you don’t have to worry about what you’re going to say, Keegan explains. Confidence can sell even the cheesiest pick-up line.

      "content": "Wait for the perfect moment to deliver your line. Timing is everything when it comes to using pick-up lines. Follow the flow of the conversation and wait for a lull before dropping your line. The best way to use a line is to break the ice and start a conversation with someone new. But if they’re already talking, pay attention to what they’re saying and wait for a break in conversation. Interrupting them is rude and shows you don’t care what they have to say. [8] X Research source Demonstrate you’re a good listener by giving them your full attention. Listening intently also shows you’re interested in who they are as a person and not just their looks. Open with a complimentary pick-up line to start flirting with someone . Saying something nice makes your line that much more effective."

      "content": "Make your lines personal to get a better response. Keegan recommends making comments that relate to the person or situation. Try to connect your line to what they’re doing, how they're acting, or the way they look, so it's not really about them. Making your pick-up line more targeted to the person makes it feel more personal and less like a generic line you could use on just anyone."

      "content": "Use their name and ask open-ended questions to keep their attention. Using a person’s name causes their brain to perk up and pay attention no matter what they're thinking about. [9] X Research source It also helps show you’re interested in them personally. Once you have their attention, ask them thoughtful, open-ended questions like, “What’s the best piece of advice you’ve ever gotten?” or “If you could go to any concert, what would it be?” Make sure you don’t use a person’s name with every sentence, or it might get awkward. Once you get them talking about something, ask follow-up questions to keep the conversation interesting."

Just remember, if all else fails, be yourself! You probably have more rizz that you realize."
