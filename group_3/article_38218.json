If you want your humor to actually diffuse tension between you and the other person, it’s important to know what they find funny. Any joke or other funny comment has to be right for the audience. [5] X Research source If there’s a mismatch, you won’t get a laugh. Or worse, you might hurt the other person even worse. Trying to be funny when you apologize can backfire and make it seem like you aren’t taking the other person’s hurt feelings seriously. Only use a funny apology if you often share jokes with the other person. Keep your funny apologies for one-on-one situations. They can seem more mocking in a group or for larger offenses."

It also shows you have some self-awareness of your negative traits. An example of self-deprecating humor in an apology is, “I’m so sorry. Clearly, my brain was operating at its usual 2% capacity when I did that.” Just remember, using too much self-deprecating humor can affect your confidence levels. Too much self-deprecating humor can also give others a negative view of you."

For example, “I’m sorry. Really sorry. Like, sorrier than a cat that fell into a bathtub.
