      "content": "Pour 5-6 drops of water in each ear canal to reduce earwax buildup. Dripping a little distilled water into your ear canals is a great way to help your body expel extra earwax. Use a plastic water dropper, and deposit 5-6 drops into 1 ear canal. Lean your head to the side so the water stays in the ear canal. Then use a clean tissue to swab the water—and loosened wax—out of your ear. Then repeat the process with your other ear.

      "content": "Drip 2-3 drops of olive oil into each ear twice a day. If your ears are still blocked after you’ve used water, try olive oil instead. Ideally, put drops in your ear canals once in the morning and once in the evening. Use a plastic liquid dropper to make sure you don’t put in too much oil, and to deposit the drops accurately inside the ear canal. Keep this up for 5-6 days, or until your ears feel less congested. [3] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source Over the following 2 weeks, you’ll notice small chunks of earwax coming out of your ears when you’re sleeping. If you don’t happen to have olive oil around your home, you can use almond oil instead. Both can be purchased in a cooking or baking aisle of your local grocery store."

[4] X Expert Source Payam Daneshrad, MD Board Certified Otolaryngologist Expert Interview. 30 September 2020. It’s only when the inner ear fails to do this that you’ll need to step in and take steps to prevent excess wax from building up. But, in nearly all cases—and especially after the wax has been adequately softened up—your ears are able to regulate themselves and expel wax as needed.

People often force small, rounded earbuds deep into their ear canals to listen to music, or sleep with earplugs in for 6-8 hours at a time. Both of these types of objects can prevent your body from expelling earwax and can force wax deeper into your ear canal. So, try to sleep without the earplugs, and take the earbuds out after 20 or 30 minutes of usage. [7] X Research source People who use hearing aids also often experience excessive amounts of built-up earwax. Talk to your doctor about ways to reduce earwax buildup if you use hearing aids."

They’re almost entirely ineffective at removing earwax from the ear canal, or loosening earwax so it can be removed by other means.

Symptoms like ear pain, a feeling of fullness in your inner ear, or temporary hearing loss can indicate a buildup of wax against your ear drum.

If your ears are prone to building up excessive amounts of wax, your doctor may advise you to loosen the wax up with over-the-counter eardrops. Drip 5-6 droplets into each ear, and tilt your head to 1 side so that the drops stay in for about 5 minutes on each side.
