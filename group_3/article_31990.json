If you experienced one of the following when you were younger, it may be the reason for your current fear of dogs. [1] X Research source You may have had a bad personal experience with one or more dogs in the past. You may have been scared, cornered or even bitten by a dog, and now that’s the only memory of dogs you have. Encountering a dog now may bring about the same feelings you had during that bad experience, making you scared of dogs in all circumstances. You may have been inadvertently taught to be afraid of dogs by someone else, such as your parents. Maybe when growing up your mom always talked negatively about dogs, or told you stories about people she knew who had been attacked by dogs. The fears she had, essentially, transferred to you. You wouldn’t have known any differently and grew up assuming dogs were terrible and you should therefore be afraid of them. It might even be possible that this anxiety is related to a disorder that you inherited genetically from your family. You may have witnessed something bad happen to someone because of a dog. You might have seen someone attacked and injured, or you might even seen a movie about dogs at an impressionable age. This event, whether fictional or real, may have caused you to develop a fear of dogs even though nothing ever happened to you personally. [2] X Research source"

[3] X Research source In addition to looking at which symptoms you may experience, think about when you experience them. Do you need to be in the presence of a dog, or can a photo or story of a dog trigger your symptoms? And, is it the dog itself that causes the fear, or something the dog is doing? For example, some people are fearful of barking, but are okay if a dog is silent. Feeling an imminent sense of danger. Feeling the need to escape or flee. Heart racing, sweating, trembling or shaking, shortness of breath, chest pain, nausea, dizziness, or chills. Feeling like what is happening is unreal.

While a fear of flying, for example, may be quite easy to avoid by simply never flying, dogs are another story. There are over 60 million dogs in the United States alone, so the chances of being able to avoid them completely is almost impossible. Ask yourself if you do the following things in order to avoid being around dogs. If you do, there’s a good chance you have cynophobia. [4] X Research source Do you avoid hanging out with specific people because they have a dog? Do you change your route specifically to avoid a house or neighborhood that has a dog?

Consider writing about your fear in a journal. Write down specific past memories that you have about dogs, and how you felt during those experiences. Learn relaxation and meditation techniques to help keep your calm and help control your anxiety.

Therapists have a very high success rate treating people with phobias. Therapists will use something called Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) which can help you alter the way you think and they can teach you skills that will help you overcome your fear. They can also use exposure therapy to help you regain control of your emotions when in the presence of dogs.

      "content": "Understand what cognitive restructuring is. Many phobias, including cynophobia, are based on how your brain comprehends a specific situation, rather than the actual situation itself. For example, you’re not likely afraid of the actual dog in front of you, but rather, you’re brain is interpreting the dog as being a threat which is then causing you to be fearful. Cognitive restructuring helps you to identify these thoughts, understand that they are irrational, and slowly help you to rethink (or reframe) your thoughts about a specific situation (i.e. dogs). It is important to go into cognitive restructuring with an open and willing mind. You need to accept the fact that your fear is probably not based on rational thought, and as such, means that you can train yourself to think differently. If you go into this type of treatment pessimistically or with the belief that you’re being completely reasonable in your fears, you will make the process much harder to overcome.

This may include thinking and talking about your past experiences with dogs, and trying to figure out what may have started the phobia in the first place. It may also include narrowing down the exact trigger that causes your fear. Is it dogs in general that cause you to be fearful, or do you become fearful when a dog does something specific (i.e. growls, barks, jumps up, runs, etc.). [8] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source This is also a chance for you and your therapist to determine if there is an underlying medical or mental condition that may be exacerbating your phobia. Underlying causes may be an anxiety disorder, depression, or maybe even a specific, yet unrelated, event that started the phobia. This is a great place to start a journal where you can record all the information about your fear of dogs that may be helpful for future therapy and analysis. Use your journal to record each event you can remember, and anything you can remember happening leading up to that event."

Once you have a solid understanding of the specific events that trigger your phobia, you need to evaluate what you are thinking when this fear occurs. What are you telling yourself? How are you interpreting the trigger event in your thoughts? What are your specific beliefs about that event the moment it is happening? [9] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Continue writing your memories and thoughts in your journal. At this point start recording the reasons why you think the events triggered your fear. Write down as many of your beliefs as you can remember. Analyze your beliefs and thoughts to determine if they include any of the following: [10] X Research source All or Nothing — do you view ALL dogs as bad, no matter what? Or do you categorize dogs differently depending on some type of feature? E.g. ”I can’t be friends with anyone who has a dog.” Should, Must, Ought — do you see a dog and automatically assume you have to be afraid of it? Do you feel like you have no other choice in the matter? E.g. ”My mom said I should never trust a dog.” Overgeneralizing — have you tried to overcome your fear before and weren’t able to, and now you assume you’ll never be able to overcome your fear of dogs? E.g. ”I tried to be near dogs before and it didn’t work. I have no choice but to be afraid of dogs.” Mental Filter — do you automatically draw conclusions about dogs based only on one or two previous experiences with dogs? E.g. “That dog attacked me when I was 3, all dogs are bad and will attack people if they get the chance.” Discounting the Positive — do you ignore something good that happened because you can’t believe it’ll happen again? E.g. ”Sure, I was able to sit beside that one dog, but he was old and sick and didn’t look like he could walk, let alone attack me.” Jumping to Conclusions — do you see or hear a dog and automatically draw a conclusion about what’s going to happen? E.g. ”That’s a pit bull, they’re awful and nasty dogs that can’t be trained properly.”"

At this point you should have a better understanding of what triggers your fear of dogs, and the thoughts and beliefs you have about dogs when that trigger happens. Now it’s time to analyze how these thoughts and beliefs actually make you feel and behave. In other words, what are the consequences of your fear? What is the fear ‘making’ you do? Continue writing in your journal. At this stage you’ll want to include your reactions (both internally and externally) to the events that triggered your fear, and the beliefs that contributed to that fear. Examples of reactions might be: You were walking down your street and encountered a dog in the yard of a specific home. Afterwards you never walked down that street again. Your neighbour has a dog that they let into the backyard to play, so you never go in your own backyard in case your neighbour’s dog is outside. You refuse to go to a friend’s house because they got a dog, and you can’t hang out with them if they bring the dog along."

Now it’s time to analyze if there’s any actual proof to back-up the reasons why you’re fearful of dogs. Think of this part of the process as you needing to be able to prove to your therapist (or yourself) that your fears are perfectly rational. [11] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Use your journal to write down each of your beliefs and the associated evidence you have as to why that belief is reasonable and rational. If you’re a really logical person, can you find any scientific proof to back up your beliefs? For example, you have the belief that all dogs are going to attack you no matter what. Why do you think this is true? Have you been attacked by every single dog you’ve ever encountered? Does everyone else get attacked by every dog they encounter?

These rational explanations will start to make sense, and make you realize that your resulting fear doesn’t make sense. [12] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source While this may sound easy, this is going to be the hardest step in your process to overcome your fear of dogs. Our beliefs can be entrenched in our minds so deeply that it can take some time (and convincing) that they make no sense. After all, your irrational beliefs may have helped you avoid bad situations, so what’s wrong with them? For example, you have a belief that all dogs attack. You weren’t able to find any evidence to back up that belief, so why do you have it? Maybe your belief is based on the fact that you saw a movie when you were 7 (that you shouldn’t have watched) that had dogs attacking and killing people. After you watched that movie you started to fear dogs based on the assumption that the movie was 100% accurate. In reality, it was just a movie, and there was no truth to it and if you think about it, you’ve never actually seen a dog attack anyone."

At this stage you need to practice being around dogs. First, you need to learn how to relax when your fear or anxiety occurs so you don’t set yourself back.

Allow your body to go as loose as you can and take 5 deep breaths. Select a specific muscle group to begin with (i.e. your left foot) and focus on those muscles.

Take one slow, deep breath while tensing the muscles you’ve selected for 5 seconds. Make sure you can feel the tension in your muscles before you move on.

[21] X Research source It is not a good idea to use a puppy, even if you think they’re cuter and not as violent. Puppies are not well-trained and can be quite unpredictable. This can cause them to do something unexpected in your presence which may only exacerbate your fear.
