      "title": "Wait until Summer.",
      "content": "Wait until Summer. Octopus can only be caught in Summer, so if you're in any other season you'll need to wait until Summer comes back around. There are four exceptions, however, though they are not viable if you haven't progressed very far in the game yet: [1] X Research source One exception is if you've got Ginger Island unlocked. You can catch Octopus on Ginger Island West during any season. Another exception is the Night Market during Winter 15 through Winter 17. You have a 2.2% chance to get an Octopus during the deep-sea submarine ride. If you have access to Qi's Walnut Room, you can buy Magic Bait that allows you to catch any fish regardless of the weather, time, or season. You can purchase Magic Bait for 5 Qi Gems, as well as the recipe for Magic Bait for 20 Qi Gems. [2] X Research source You can also rarely find Octopus for sale in the Traveling Cart for 450 to 1,000 gold."

      "content": "Go to the Beach between 6am and 1pm. You can only catch Octopi between the hours of 6 in the morning and 1 in the afternoon. If you're hunting an Octopus, it's best to go directly to the Beach once you wake up. If you have a Beach Farm, you can also catch an Octopus on your farm."

      "title": "Go fishing.",
      "content": "Go fishing. The Octopus is one of the rarest fish in the game besides the Legendary fish. You have a 4 to 11% chance to hook an Octopus at the Beach. If you've opted to try and catch an Octopus on Ginger Island, you've got a 5 to 18% chance of hooking one."

      "content": "Level up Fishing to level 10. Each Fishing level makes it a little bit easier to complete the Fishing minigame, and if you're trying to catch an Octopus you may need all the help you can get due to its difficulty.

      "content": "Use a Trap Bobber. Trap Bobbers make fish less likely to escape by making the Fishing progress bar decrease more slowly when the fish isn't within the Fishing bar. [5] X Research source After getting to Fishing level 6, you can purchase a Trap Bobber from Willy's Fish Shop for 500 gold, or you can craft one. You can also sometimes find it in the Traveling Cart for 600 to 1,000 gold. You can also use a Cork Bobber (which increases the Fishing bar size) but the Trap Bobber is more helpful when catching the Octopus. [6] X Research source"

Below are the best dishes to make as well as what buff(s) they provide and where to obtain the recipe: [7] X Research source Dish O' The Sea: Fishing +3 for 5 minutes and 35 seconds. Obtained by reaching Fishing level 3. Fish Stew: Fishing +3 for 16 minutes and 47 seconds. Obtained via mail after getting Willy's relationship to 7+ hearts. Lobster Bisque: Fishing +3 and Max Energy +50 for 16 minutes and 47 seconds. Obtained via the Queen of Sauce on Year 2 Winter 14, or via mail after getting Willy's relationship to 9+ hearts.

[8] X Research source This will simply get you to the Beach faster, allowing you more chances to catch an Octopus. It's an optional but time-saving step. You learn how to craft Warp Totems once you reach Foraging level 6. Beach Warp Totems are single-use and are crafted with 1 Hardwood, 2 Coral, and 10 Fiber. [9] X Research source After finishing the Goblin Problem quest, you can purchase the Water Obelisk farm building from the Wizard. It costs 500,000 gold to build and requires 5 Iridium Bars, 10 Clams, and 10 Coral. [10] X Research source Unlike the Warp Totem, you can use the Obelisk to teleport over and over."

You have a 4-11% chance of catching an Octopus on the Beach, and a 5-18% chance to catch an Octopus on Ginger Island. If you take a Submarine during the Night Market, you have a 2.2% chance to catch an Octopus. If you're using a Curiosity Lure, that chance lowers to 1.6%."
