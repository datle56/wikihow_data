      "title": "Say dia duit (dee-ah gwit) to greet people in any setting.",
      "content": "Say dia duit (dee-ah gwit) to greet people in any setting. This phrase literally means \"God to you,\" also interpreted as \"May God be with you.\" Amongst Irish speakers, this is the common way to say \"hello\" to anyone you meet . [2] X Research source This phrase is used as a traditional greeting regardless of your religious beliefs or the religious beliefs of the person you're greeting. However, it's also a Christian blessing. [3] X Research source If you're greeting several people at once, the duit becomes daoibh . You would say dia daoibh (dee-ah deev), which literally means \"God to you all.\""

      "title": "Respond to dia duit with dia is Muire duit.",
      "content": "Respond to dia duit with dia is Muire duit . Rather than simply saying dia duit in return when someone says it to you, the more common response is dia is Muire duit (dee-ah iss Mwir-eh gwit). This phrase literally means \"God and Mary to you.\" [4] X Research source You typically wouldn't need a plural version of this phrase, because even if there were a group of people, your response would only be to the person who spoke. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Try mora duit if you want to avoid a greeting with religious implications.",
      "content": "Try mora duit if you want to avoid a greeting with religious implications. If you're not Christian, you may not feel comfortable greeting people with what is essentially a Catholic blessing. Mora duit is an alternative that simply means \"morrow to you.\" [6] X Research source The word mora comes from Mór , the name of a Celtic goddess. However, this phrase has largely lost any religious or spiritual significance in modern times."

      "title": "Use aon scéal (ay-uhn shkail) with people you know reasonably well.",
      "content": "Use aon scéal (ay-uhn shkail) with people you know reasonably well. This phrase literally means \"any story?\" It's similar to saying \"what's up?\" in English, so it's appropriate with friends and acquaintances around your age. You might also use it with children or people significantly younger than you, even if you don't know them very well. [7] X Research source This is considered a very informal, casual phrase. Even though Irish speakers don't tend to be as formal as many European cultures, it's still a good idea to avoid this phrase in serious or professional contexts."

    {
      "title": "Ask conas atá tú after your initial greeting.",
      "content": "Ask conas atá tú after your initial greeting. In English, you typically would say \"how are you\" after greeting someone, and Irish is no different. To ask after someone's well-being in Irish, say conas atá tú . [8] X Research source In the Western or Connaught Gaelic dialect, you would say cén chaoi a bhfuil tú . Although the pronunciation is different, it means the same thing as conas atá tú . The response to conas atá tú is tá me go maith (taw may guh maw), which means \"I am well.\""

      "title": "Use \"well\" as a greeting in the Irish midlands.",
      "content": "Use \"well\" as a greeting in the Irish midlands. This greeting is more common with people you know but can be used with anyone. However, you'd generally want to avoid using it with elders or people in a position of authority. It's usually drawn out long and slow, like \"weeeeeelllll,\" and might be followed by the name of the person you're greeting. [9] X Research source In Gaelic, this greeting is spelled \"bhuel,\" but pronounced roughly the same as the English word \"well.\" [10] X Research source"

The origin of this phrase is unknown, but it is understood as a greeting. [11] X Research source You may also hear \"hup ye boy ye\" or \"hup ye girl ye.\""

      "title": "Say \"'bout ye\" in Belfast.",
      "content": "Say \"'bout ye\" in Belfast. \"'Bout ye\" is a shortened version of \"how's about ye?\" This question is typically used to ask how someone's doing, but it's also used as a greeting on its own. This greeting is most common in Belfast and Northern Ireland. [12] X Research source From Dublin to Dursey Island, you'll likely hear \"how ya,\" a phrase similar to \"'bout ye.\" It has the same meaning, in that you're asking how someone's doing, but you're also greeting them at the same time."

      "content": "Include polite phrases to show respect and mind your manners. As in any language, respect and politeness are important when speaking Irish , especially if you're talking to someone older than you or in a position of authority. Some polite words and phrases to learn include: [13] X Research source Más é do thoil é (maws aye duh hull aye): \"please\" (literally \"if it is your will\") Go raibh maith agat (guh rev mah ah-gut): \"thanks\" (literally \"that there may good at you\") Tá fáilte romhat (taw fall-che row-at): \"you're welcome\" (in response to thanks; literally \"there is a welcome before you\"). Tá fáilte romhat is also used as a greeting, particularly if you are welcoming someone into your home."

(pronounced Cod iss anim gwit? ), they are asking you what your name is. A literal translation of the question would be \"What is the name to you?\" [14] X Research source To respond to this question, say your name followed by the phrase is ainm dom (iss anim dum). This means, literally, that your name \"is the name to you,\" but a more accurate translation would be \"My name is.\""

(pronounced On will Gail-geh ah-gut? ), which means \"Do you speak Gaelic/Irish?\" If you've only learned a few words in phrases, saying beagáinín lets them know you only speak \"a little bit\" of Irish. [15] X Research source You can also say tá cúpla focal agam (taw koop-la fuk-al a-gum). A literal translation of this phrase would be \"There is a couple of words at me,\" but like '' beagáinín , it means that you only speak a little Irish."

This phrase literally means \"health (or safety) till later,\" but it is used in the same sense as you would say \"see you later\" in English."
