Rinse your hands thoroughly to get rid of any soap residue. Pat your hands dry on a clean microfiber towel to avoid lint. [1] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Opthamologists Professional medical organization focused on advocating for public health and supporting sight-related research Go to source Always use a clean, dry towel to dry your hands. Microfiber towels are your best option because they’re less likely to leave lint or fuzz on your hands, which might get on your contacts. If you don’t have a microfiber towel, you might consider letting your hands air-dry if your eyes are sensitive."

Only open 1 side of your contact case at a time to help you avoid mixing up your contacts or accidentally damaging one. Get into the habit of always doing the same side first.

Once the lens is on your finger tip, slowly pull your finger out of the container and transfer the lens to the palm of your hand. [3] X Research source Don’t use your nails to get the contact, as this may damage it. Be very careful with your contacts because it’s easy to damage them."

      "content": "Rinse the contact lens with your contact solution. Position the contact in the center of your palm, then spray a stream of contact solution over it. Do a visual inspection to make sure your contact is free of debris. You don’t need to rub the contact unless you see some debris on it. [4] X Trustworthy Source American Optometric Association Professional medical organization dedicated to supporting optometrists and improving public eye and vision health Go to source If you see any debris on the contact, apply more contact solution to it and lightly rub it with your fingertip to remove the debris.

      "content": "Place the contact concave side up on your index finger. Put the contact on the skin of your finger, not your nail. Make sure that the contact is sitting hollow-side up on your fingertip with none of the side walls sticking to your finger. It should look like a tiny bowl. If the edges are flaring out, then it is inside out. Put it back on your palm and use your fingertip to gently flip it right side out."

      "title": "Hold your eye open with your middle finger and opposite hand, if necessary.",
      "content": "Hold your eye open with your middle finger and opposite hand, if necessary. Look in the mirror. Then, gently pull your eyelid down using the middle finger of the hand that’s holding your contact. If your eyes are very sensitive to touch, you may also need to hold your upper eyelid open. Use your opposite hand to gently lift and hold the upper eyelid to keep it from blinking. This will expose more of your eye, allowing you to more easily place the contact onto it. [5] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source You only need to hold your top eyelid open if it keeps blinking or your eye is very small. This is normal when you first start wearing contacts, as you’re not used to putting things in your eye. Over time, you may not need to hold your upper eyelid open anymore."

Additionally, do your best not to focus on the eye you’re putting the contact into, which will make it easier to not blink. [6] X Research source"

The contact should easily go onto your eye, as it will be attracted to the moisture. Then, remove your finger from your eye. [7] X Research source The contact needs to be over your iris, which is the colored part of your eye. Try to put it directly over this area, if you can."

The drops will wet your contact so that it comes off more easily. Squeeze 2-3 of drops of lubricating and rewetting solution into your eyes to wet them. [11] X Research source Check the label to make sure your rewetting drops are approved for use with contacts. If they aren’t, don’t use those drops, as they’ll damage your contacts. If you don't have rewetting drops, you can use saline solution to wet your eyes. However, you shouldn't use contact lens cleaning solution, which can dry or irritate your eyes."

      "content": "Replace your contacts according to your doctor’s instructions. Most contacts are disposable, meaning you change them frequently. Depending on the type and brand of contact you’re wearing, your doctor will likely tell you to change them daily, weekly, biweekly, or monthly. Always stick to this schedule and change your contacts as directed. This will help you keep your eyes healthy. [18] X Research source Soft contacts are typically changed either every day, weekly, biweekly, or monthly. Extended wear contacts can be worn overnight, and they're typically changed weekly, biweekly, or monthly, depending on the brand and your individual needs. Rigid gas permeable lenses last much longer and may be worn for up to a year. However, your doctor will give you additional cleaning instructions for maintaining these lenses, which aren't prescribed often. Don’t try to save money by wearing your contacts for too long. Your contacts were formulated to last for a certain period of time. After that point, they start to deteriorate, making them less comfortable and more likely to collect germs, bacteria, or debris that can harm your eyes."

Always remove your contacts at night unless your doctor tells you it’s safe to sleep in them. [19] X Research source If you have dry eyes, you may not be able to sleep in contacts even if they’re approved for sleeping. Talk to your doctor if you think you have dry eyes."

Next, put the contact lens case into the boiling water and wait at least 3 minutes. Remove the water from the heat, then use tongs or a slotted spoon to remove the contact lens case from the water. Let the case cool before handling it. Finally, rinse it with saline solution before using it again.

      "content": "Avoid using saliva or tap water to clean your lenses. Don’t ever put your contacts in your mouth to clean them, as this will make them very dirty. Your saliva isn’t sterile, and it will introduce germs and bacteria to your lenses. Similarly, tap water is also not sterile, and any bacteria or chemicals in the water will stick to your contacts. Additionally, both saliva and water will dry out your lenses. Always clean your lenses with a contact solution.

Although you might wear your contacts most of the time, you need to have a pair of backup glasses for times you aren’t wearing them. Wear your glasses at night to give your eyes a break from your contacts. Additionally, wear your glasses if you’re experiencing any eye irritation or think you may have an infection. [25] X Research source Visit your eye doctor if you think you may have an infection. If you’re worried about the cost of your backup glasses, look for a budget option. For instance, you can buy glasses online for as low as $6.95. Just ask your doctor to give you a copy of your prescription and to write your pupillary distance (PD) on it, which is a measurement you’ll need to buy your glasses."
