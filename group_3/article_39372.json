      "title": "Decide on the purpose of your bow.",
      "content": "Decide on the purpose of your bow. Recurve bows are used for one of two purposes: for target archery or for hunting. These bows are essentially the same, with one fundamental difference: the draw weight. This is the amount of power you’ll need to draw the bow. Decide if you’ll use your bow primarily for target archery or for hunting. [1] X Research source Your bow will need a higher draw weight for hunting."

    {
      "title": "Choose a suitable draw weight",
      "content": "Choose a suitable draw weight . Draw weight on a bow correlates to how hard you have to pull in order to draw back the string on the bow. To select your ideal draw weight an adult beginner should start between 18 and 24lbs of draw weight. Children should start even lower. [2] X Research source Choosing a low draw weight will result in less speed and power in your shooting but will allow you to get proper form and technique. If you're a beginner, shoot with a lighter bow with regard to the draw weight. Don't choose a bow that's too hard to pull back. If it seems too easy, move up a weight. Younger people should also choose a lower draw weight."

      "content": "Opt for a bow length that, when placed on the ground sits with the end of the top limb between your nose and forehead. Bows come in different lengths. The average teenager and adult should use a 66 or 68 inch bow. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Decide if you want a take-down bow.",
      "content": "Decide if you want a take-down bow. A take-down bow is one that dismantles for easy portability. The bow’s two limbs can be separated from the rest of the bow. This also allows for easier servicing of the bow. A take-down bow also makes the draw weight flexible. You don’t need to buy a whole new bow if you decide to raise your draw weight; rather, you’d just need to purchase new limbs for the bow. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Try out a few different bows.",
      "content": "Try out a few different bows. It is a good idea to see how well you can hold and shoot a bow before you settle on purchasing it. Try out some different options at a local archery shop. This place will likely have several sample brands and styles."

      "title": "Measure your draw length.",
      "content": "Measure your draw length. Your draw length is the length that your arm can draw the bowstring back in order to shoot the arrow. Spread your arms out to either side of your body and hold them parallel to the ground. Have someone measure the exact number of inches from one middle fingertip on one arm to the middle fingertip on your other arm. Divide this number by 2.5. This gives you your approximate draw length, it should be checked by a professional before you purchase anything. [5] X Research source Your arrow length will be 1-2 inches more than your draw length."

    {
      "title": "Choose the arrow",
      "content": "Choose the arrow material and weight. Most arrows are made of either aluminum, wood, or carbon, which keeps them relatively lightweight. Fiberglass arrows are an option for youth bows and bowfishing. The arrow weight can vary in the shaft. The heavier the arrow shaft, the deeper it will sink into a target. If you are using an arrow for target practice, you don’t need the arrow to sink in very far. If you are using it for hunting, however, you do need the arrow to sink in through skin and bone. Carbon arrows may explode, so if it hits something hard, flex it listening for cracking sounds. If you hear them, don't shoot the arrow. Many people have had arrows through their hands because of this. Aluminum and wood arrows will bend if they hit something hard, although they can be straightened."

      "title": "Consider whether to get vanes or fletchings.",
      "content": "Consider whether to get vanes or fletchings. Vanes are plastic rudders that steer an arrow. You can shoot them using a whisker biscuit rest or fur rests. Fletchings are feathers. They are used when shooting off the shelf to avoid deflection of the arrow. If you are shooting outdoors, opt for vanes, as they are rain-proof."

      "content": "Make sure that hunting arrows for large game (deer, elk, etc.. ) have broadheads. If you are planning to get arrows for hunting, make sure they have suitable heads made of strong materials with good piercing power. For small game, use judo, field, or blunt tips. Broadheads will rip apart your game and ruin it."

      "title": "Get a target.",
      "content": "Get a target. Shooting a recurve bow is not as simple as picking up the bow and some arrows alone. If you plan on practicing someplace like your backyard as opposed to a range, then you will need to purchase a suitable target that won’t ruin your arrows. Targets are available online or at sporting goods stores. Alternately, make your own target with 2 firm hay bales. Wrap them in shade cloth to tighten them up."

      "title": "Buy a finger tab.",
      "content": "Buy a finger tab. A finger tab is a strap of leather that protects your fingers from the tension of the string as you pull it back. Your finger tab goes on the fingers that will be drawing back your bowstring with your pointer finger above the arrow and middle and fourth below. You can also touch your thumb to your pinkie behind the string to keep them out of the way. [6] X Research source You can also choose a glove for the same purpose, although they are more expensive and not used by Olympic archers since they may make extra contact with the string, throwing off the accuracy."

      "content": "Hold the bow with a firm yet comfortable grip. If you are right-handed, hold the bow with your left hand on the hand grip. Most recurve bows have handles, so you will know where to hold the bow. Note that your life line should be perpendicular to the ground when you hold your bow. The knuckles on your hand should be at an approximately 45-degree angle. Don’t hold your bow with a death grip. This will cause inaccuracy in your shooting. [10] X Research source Stay relaxed so that every movement will be smooth."

      "title": "Lift the bow to shoulder height.",
      "content": "Lift the bow to shoulder height. As you lift, ensure that the arm holding the bow is straight and locked at the elbow. [11] X Research source If your elbow is bent at all, it will be much more difficult to draw the bow. Put the one odd color vane between your riser and the arm holding your bow. If the nock isn't positioned where you can do this, the arrows aren't meant for recurve. You can still shoot it, but your accuracy may suffer slightly. Keeping the elbow of your bow arm straight additionally helps to keep your arm away from the bowstring as you release. [12] X Research source"

      "title": "Pull the bowstring back.",
      "content": "Pull the bowstring back. You should pull back far enough that your hand rests right under your jawbone. Your bowstring should touch your face around the corner of your mouth. This is called an anchor point. [13] X Research source Check again as you draw back that you are not twisting your torso to face the target. Don't be afraid of the string and touch it to your face. Unless you wrap it behind your ear, it will not hurt you in any way. Try to practice letting the stronger muscles in your back do most of the work as you draw the bow as opposed to your arm muscles. Have a person push your elbow forward while you try to resist to experience this. [14] X Research source Don't chicken wing by placing your elbow below the arrow. Keep it up and aligned with the arrow."

      "content": "Take aim. You want to aim with your dominant eye while keeping your other eye closed. [15] X Research source Your dominant eye is much more reliable for your aim to the target. If your bow has a sight, use the notches in the sight to help you line up your target. Also check your aim with your eyes, so you don't get tunnel vision."

      "title": "Relax your fingers off the string to loose.",
      "content": "Relax your fingers off the string to loose. Don’t jerk the string back, or the arrow won't fly straight. Keep your release as smooth and gentle as possible, thinking of the action more like relaxing your fingers off the string as opposed to letting it go. [16] X Research source Don't move your hand or arm while you shoot. \"Helping\" the arrow doesn't actually help at all."

      "content": "Stay in position until the arrow hits the target. Once you release the string, the arrow still must accelerate off the bow, and any movement during the fraction of a second can disrupt the intended flight path of the arrow. Train yourself not to jerk or flinch by holding your position until you hear the arrow hit the target. [17] X Research source"
