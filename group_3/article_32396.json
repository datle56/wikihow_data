      "content": "Take a practice test if your teacher provides one. Some math teachers will give their students a practice test that they can use to study. If your teacher provides a practice test, take it and read through it several times and make sure you understand everything on it. Some of the same problems may show up on the actual math test, so making sure you fully understand the test will increase your chances of passing. [2] X Research source You can also make your own practice test using problems from class and your book. Another option is to look up relevant practice tests online. Advocate for answer keys with your practice test and homework materials. This way, you can get instant feedback on whether or not you completed the problem correctly.

If you are still struggling to understand a concept, check to see if there are any YouTube video explanations of them. These may be easier to follow than material in a textbook or your notes.

      "content": "Do the assigned homework for your class. Your math teacher will likely assign homework on a regular basis that is meant to help prepare you for tests. Make sure that you always do the homework, even if it is optional or not worth many points. Doing this extra work will help to prepare you for the tests, which will help you pass the class. [7] X Research source Complete extra problems if you are having trouble with a concept. For example, if your teacher assigns all of the even problems at the end of the chapter, do the evens and the odds. Your textbook may have a section in the back where you can check your answers. If it does, use it to see how you are doing. Write out the required formula for each problem as you do the homework. This will make it easier for you to remember it when you take a test."

Although you may not enjoy reading your math textbook, it is a great way to ensure that you understand the concepts and terms your teacher covers in class. Take time to carefully read the chapters your teacher assigns and ask questions if something is unclear.

You can use flashcards to help you memorize math formulas, key terms, and concepts. Write the formula, term, or concept on 1 side of the card, and then write an explanation and an example on the other side. [10] X Research source For example, if you want to memorize the math formula for a quadratic equation, then you could write the formula on 1 side of the card, and then write an explanation of how to use the formula along with an example on the opposite side."

      "content": "Read through word problems and extrapolate the numbers. Word problems can be very confusing, especially when they contain lots of extra information that does not contribute to the math of the problem. Take a minute to read through each of the word problems on a test first, and identify the relevant numbers to solving the equation. Then, plug the numbers into a formula that will help you to find a solution. [14] X Research source For example, if the problem reads: “Albert has 27 cars that he wants to park on his lawn, and each car requires a 10 by 10 ft (3.0 by 3.0 m) space. Albert's lawn is 100 by 180 ft (30 by 55 m). How many of the cars can he park on his lawn?” The relevant numbers for this problem are the number of cars, the amount of space per car: 10 by 10 ft (3.0 by 3.0 m), and the total size of Albert's lawn: 100 by 180 ft (30 by 55 m)."

Even if you get an answer wrong, some teachers will award extra points if you show your work and include extra information that demonstrates your knowledge. Make sure to write out as much detail as you can for each problem, especially if you are unsure about the answer. [15] X Research source For example, if you need to complete an equation using a specific formula, write the formula out first. Then, complete the equation using the formula and show any additional calculations you need to do to complete the problem."

To increase your chances of getting points for a question you are unsure about, you can eliminate any responses that you think are wrong. Try to solve the problem, and then eliminate any answers that are clearly wrong. [16] X Research source For example,say you complete the problem and get 72 as your answer, but the options available are a) 56, b) 71, c) 77, and d) 112. You could eliminate a and d since they are far off from your answer. Your best option would likely be b since it is the closest to the answer you got."

Go with the option that seems like the right response if you have an idea of what that might be. Some additional ways of guessing the answer include: [17] X Research source Avoiding choices that are very different from the other responses. Opting for an “all” or “none” answer if these are options. Going with the longest answer option for a word problem."
