      "title": "Monitor ghosting is when moving objects on your screen leave a trail behind them.",
      "content": "Monitor ghosting is when moving objects on your screen leave a trail behind them. Ghosting can make these images look blurry or like they're smearing across the screen, but it can also be a little difficult to detect. When watching a movie or playing a game, ghosting might just look like motion blur. [1] X Research source However, it tends to be easier to see in darker scenes. You can test ghosting on your monitors by going to the BLUR BUSTERS Motion Test online. If the moving image looks like it's blurry or smearing across the screen as it moves, you're likely experiencing some monitor ghosting."

      "title": "Ghosting is caused by low-refresh rate monitors.",
      "content": "Ghosting is caused by low-refresh rate monitors. It occurs most often with low-refresh rate LCD screen monitors, especially those that use VA (vertical alignment) LCD panels. [2] X Research source If your monitor uses a VA panel and doesn't have G-Sync or FreeSync, you can try to reduce ghosting but it will likely always be there to some degree. Rarely, GPUs and display cables (like HDMI and DisplayPort) can also cause ghosting. However, it's more likely that your monitor is the culprit."

      "title": "Change the response time on your monitor.",
      "content": "Change the response time on your monitor. While it might seem like you want to make the response time as fast as possible, that may not work for your specific monitor. Test out each response time to see if any of the options fixes or minimizes your ghosting issue. Open your monitor's OSD (on-screen display). You can do this by pressing the menu button on your monitor, which may be located on the back or bottom. You may have a dedicated button, or you may have a singular joystick-like button on the bottom of your monitor. Each monitor will be slightly different. Search for the Response Time option. This may be in a menu called \"Game Adjust,\" \"Gaming,\" \"Game,\" \"Display,\" or \"Other.\" The menu option may also be called something like Pixel Response , Overdrive , or something similar. Change the response time. Test out different response times to see which one works best for you."

    {
      "title": "Change your monitor's refresh rate.",
      "content": "Change your monitor's refresh rate. If your monitor's refresh rate is set too low, you may notice more ghosting. However, if your monitor is using a VA panel and/or your monitor has a low refresh rate, you likely will still notice some ghosting even after adjusting the refresh rate. In the taskbar search bar, type display settings and click Display settings in the menu. Scroll down and click Advanced display . Choose the monitor you want to adjust in the dropdown in the top-right of the window, if you have more than one monitor. Change the refresh rate in the dropdown next to \"Choose a refresh rate.\" For best results, try 144Hz or 120Hz. If your monitor doesn't have an option for 120Hz or 144Hz, your monitor may not have a high enough refresh rate to avoid ghosting. If you try a higher refresh rate and you're still experiencing ghosting, you will likely need to replace your monitor to get rid of the ghosting."

      "title": "Enable G-SYNC/FreeSync.",
      "content": "Enable G-SYNC/FreeSync. G-SYNC and FreeSync are display technologies that synchronize your monitor's refresh rate with your GPU's frame rate, which can help reduce or eliminate ghosting. G-SYNC works with NVIDIA's GPUs, and FreeSync works with AMD's GPUs. Not all monitors have G-SYNC/FreeSync support, but if yours does, try enabling it to see if it fixes the problem. G-SYNC : [3] X Research source Open the NVIDIA Control Panel. Click Set up G-SYNC under the \"Display\" heading. Click Enable G-SYNC, G-SYNC Compatible . Choose whether to enable for full-screen mode only or windowed- and full-screen mode. Choose the monitor you want to change (if you have more than one). Check the box next to Enable settings for the selected display model . If you do not see this option, your monitor is not G-SYNC compatible. FreeSync : [4] X Research source Open the AMD Radeon Settings app. Click Display at the top. Choose the monitor at the top of the screen (if you have more than one). Ensure that FreeSync is enabled for your display."

      "title": "Change your monitor's display settings.",
      "content": "Change your monitor's display settings. You can adjust your monitor's settings to cover up the effect of ghosting. This won't fix the ghosting issue, but it can make the ghosting less annoying to see. These settings can be adjusted in your monitor's OSD (on-screen display). Brightness and contrast : Since ghosting typically appears in darker scenes, adjusting the brightness and contrast of your monitor can reduce how bothersome ghosting is when it occurs. Motion blur reduction : If your monitor has a motion blur reduction setting, try enabling it. It may help reduce ghosting."

      "title": "Change your game's display settings.",
      "content": "Change your game's display settings. If you're only noticing ghosting in one game, you may want to adjust the settings within that game to fix or reduce it. Try disabling or enabling motion blur, if your game has the option, to see if it affects ghosting. Try disabling frame generation, which can sometimes cause ghosting artifacts. This might be called Frame Generation, Multi Frame Generation, Fluid Motion Frames, or AMD Fluid Motion Frames 1. Increase the maximum frame rate. Try to match the frame rate to whatever your refresh rate is (144 or 120 are best)."

      "title": "Update your GPU drivers.",
      "content": "Update your GPU drivers. While it's rare that your GPU will be the cause of ghosting, it is possible. To eliminate that possibility, ensure your GPU's drivers are completely up to date, especially if you're noticing ghosting in a brand new game. NVIDIA and AMD will sometimes release driver updates the same day a new game comes out if updates are needed to play that new game."

      "title": "Switch out old display cables.",
      "content": "Switch out old display cables. It's also rare for display cables to be the cause of ghosting, but you can easily eliminate them as a possibility by changing out your cables, especially if they're old or worn out. You might also want to try a different HDMI or DisplayPort port on your computer, or switch from HDMI to DisplayPort all together."

      "title": "Get a new monitor.",
      "content": "Get a new monitor. Unfortunately, the only way to get rid of ghosting if you have a low-refresh rate and/or VA panel LCD monitor is to get a new monitor entirely. IPS monitors can still experience ghosting, but it's much less noticeable than a VA monitor. Look for a monitor that has at least 144Hz refresh rate and supports G-SYNC/FreeSync. To nearly eliminate ghosting, you can get an OLED monitor . However, this comes at a cost: OLED monitors are much more expensive than LCD monitors. Once again, look for a monitor that has at least 144Hz refresh rate and supports G-SYNC/FreeSync for the best visual experience possible."

      "title": "Is monitor ghosting permanent?",
      "content": "Is monitor ghosting permanent? Ghosting may or may not be permanent, and it can be fixed or reduced in a variety of ways. It depends on a few factors, such as your monitor's refresh rate, response time, and display technology. If your monitor has a low refresh rate or uses a VA LCD panel, the ghosting will likely never go away fully, even if you adjust your monitor settings."

      "content": "Will monitor ghosting damage my computer? In and of itself, ghosting is not considered damage and will not damage your computer. However, if you experience a lot of ghosting, it could strain your GPU or monitor and cause their lifespan to degrade slightly. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "What's the difference between ghosting and burn-in?",
      "content": "What's the difference between ghosting and burn-in? Ghosting is when you see a trail or smear behind an object when it moves across your screen. Burn-in (also called image retention or a ghost image) is when you can see an after-image of an element on your screen after you move or close it. Burn-in is considered damage to the screen, whereas ghosting is a result of certain monitor hardware or settings."
