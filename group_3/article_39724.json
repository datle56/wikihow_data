For example, in the fraction 10 4 {\\displaystyle {\\frac {10}{4}}} , 4 is the denominator, and it tells you that a whole is divided into four equal parts, or quarters."

      "content": "Count how many whole circles you shaded in. To simplify an improper fraction, you must turn it into a mixed number, which includes a whole number and a fraction together. The number of whole circles you shaded in represents the whole number of your mixed fraction. Write this number down. For example, for the fraction 10 4 {\\displaystyle {\\frac {10}{4}}} , you should have shaded in 2 whole circles, so the whole number of your mixed number will be 2."

      "content": "Count how many parts of a whole you shaded in. The leftover shaded parts will represent the fraction in your mixed number. Write this fraction next to your whole number, and you have your mixed number. For the fraction 10 4 {\\displaystyle {\\frac {10}{4}}} , you should have shaded in 2 4 {\\displaystyle {\\frac {2}{4}}} of a circle, so the fraction part of your mixed number will be 2 4 {\\displaystyle {\\frac {2}{4}}} . So 10 4 {\\displaystyle {\\frac {10}{4}}} is equal to 2 2 4 {\\displaystyle 2{\\frac {2}{4}}} ."

[5] X Research source To simplify an improper fraction, you must turn it into a mixed number, which includes a whole number and a fraction together. The number of times you can divide the numerator evenly by the denominator will be the whole number of your mixed number. Write this number down, and note the remainder. The denominator will not divide evenly into the numerator. The remainder will be interpreted as the fraction part of your mixed number. For example, for the fraction 10 4 {\\displaystyle {\\frac {10}{4}}} complete the calculation 10 รท 4 = 2 R 2 {\\displaystyle 10\\div 4=2R2} .

Combine this new fraction with the whole number, and you have your mixed number. For example, 10 รท 4 = 2 R 2 {\\displaystyle 10\\div 4=2R2} , so the fraction would be 2 4 {\\displaystyle {\\frac {2}{4}}} .
