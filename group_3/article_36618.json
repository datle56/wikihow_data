      "content": "Soak plastic in hydrogen peroxide for 3-4 hours to fix discoloration. Hydrogen peroxide works well on plastics that have turned entirely yellow instead of in just one spot. Fill a plastic bag or container with enough hydrogen peroxide to cover the plastic. Stick the plastic item in the hydrogen peroxide and set it out in direct sunlight. Wait 3-4 hours before rinsing it off with clean water. [1] X Research source This method works particularly well on yellowed phone cases and other small items. If you’re cleaning an electronic device or appliance, remove the plastic pieces and then soak them in the hydrogen peroxide. Remove any non-plastic parts from the item you’re treating before putting it into the hydrogen peroxide. Optional tip : Use an old toothbrush to scrub the hydrogen peroxide onto the plastic."

Then, remove the plastic pieces from the device and set them in the container. Put on gloves and safety goggles and pour enough 12% hydrogen peroxide in the container to cover the plastic pieces. Line the outside of the container with aluminum foil and turn on the lights. Then, leave the parts to soak for 12 to 24 hours. [4] X Research source If the plastic pieces float, weigh them down with a stainless steel bolt or screw. If the plastic is still yellow after 24 hours, let it soak for longer. Retrobriting is a cleaning method that’s specifically used to remove yellowing from computers, game consoles, and other electronics."

      "content": "Scrub electronics, appliances, and containers with a baking soda paste. Pour some baking soda into a small cup or container. Add water slowly, mixing it with the baking soda until it forms a thick paste. Then, green cleaning expert Susan Stocker says to “rub [the paste] really well” into the plastic with a sponge or paper towel, “press[ing] hard so that you get the paste inside the little ‘pores’ of the plastic.” She recommends letting the paste sit for 1 day before rinsing it off. Stocker says to “apply a tiny bit more paste after you scrub so it doesn’t all dry out too quickly” which gives the paste “time to ‘eat’ the stains.”"
