      "content": "Dab the ends of synthetic braids with glue for extra-staying power. This is totally optional—some people love it while others prefer to skip it altogether and go straight to dipping their braids. If you want to, use nail glue or super glue. Just put a few drops on the end of each braid to help them last longer. [1] X Research source These types of glues dry incredibly fast. Even so, make sure your braids are completely set before moving on to dipping your braids. You really shouldn’t use glue on your natural hair. If you do, apply it at the ends and keep in mind that you might have to trim off that part once you’re ready to take your braids out."

      "content": "Boil a pot of water. Use a pot on the stove, a tea kettle, or a bowl in the microwave—the method doesn’t make a difference as long as the water heats up! Heat enough water to fill a big pitcher. [2] X Research source Dipping your braids in hot water (rather than cold or warm water) keeps the ends straight and frizz-free, and it helps keep them from coming undone. It’s an easy way to set newly-done braids or to refresh older ones."

      "content": "Pour the water into a big plastic pitcher. Be super careful and protect your hands with a towel or oven mitt if needed. Avoid using thin, plastic containers or glass ones, as they can get too hot to handle. [3] X Research source Squeeze 2-3 drops of baby oil into the pitcher to give your braids a nice, natural shine.

      "content": "Section your hair into parts if your pitcher can’t fit all the ends at once. Depending on how much hair you have and how thick your braids are, working in sections might be easier than trying to treat all your braids at once. The call is totally up to you, though. [5] X Research source Tie or clip up half of your hair to do the bottom section first. Or, do the left side first before switching to the right side."

      "title": "Dip the ends of your braids up and down in the pitcher.",
      "content": "Dip the ends of your braids up and down in the pitcher. Saturate the braids as high up as you can go—the deeper you dip, the smoother your braids get. Everyone has their own rhythm they like to follow, and there isn’t a set “right” way to do this. As an example, try dipping your braids up and down 4-5 times and holding them in the water for 5-10 seconds each time. [6] X Research source If the pitcher is too hot to handle with your bare hands, wear a pair of gloves. [7] X Research source If you’re doing this for someone else, put a towel across their back to keep them from getting wet."

      "content": "Squeeze and pull your braids with a dry towel to remove moisture. After you’ve dipped the ends of your braids, wrap them in a towel. Pull down on your braids and stretch them straight. Repeat until your braids are just slightly damp. [8] X Research source This is a super important part of the process. The pulling and stretching keep the ends of your braids from curling or getting matted. Dip and dry one section before moving on to the next."

If your braids are done to the end or if you used glue to seal them, this isn’t something you have to worry about. But, if the tips of your hair are unbraided, brushing them helps keep them straight and tangle-free. [9] X Research source Use a hard bristle brush or whatever your favorite detangling brush is."

      "content": "Sleep on a silk or satin pillowcase to reduce friction and frizz. It takes a long time to get your braids done, and you want them to look fresh for as long as possible! Silk or satin lets your hair slide across rather than rub against the pillowcase, which means your braids look nicer for longer. [10] X Research source A silk or satin scarf or bonnet works just as well as a pillowcase."

      "content": "Let a water-based mousse dissolve on your scalp to tame flyaways. Focus the mousse on your scalp, and don’t be afraid to really coat your braids. Once the mousse is in place, pull your hair back into a ponytail and cover it with a silk scarf. Wait for an hour, then undo your frizz-free locks. [11] X Research source If there is any mousse leftover, massage a few drops of grapeseed or jojoba oil into your braids. The oil gets rid of the mousse and leaves your hair with a beautiful shine."

      "content": "Combat frizz with a hot towel if you prefer a product-free option. Submerge a clean towel in a pot of boiling water, then remove it (carefully!) with a pair of tongs. Let it cool down enough to touch it without getting hurt, and lay it over your scalp and braids. Leave it until the towel cools off, then take it off and let your hair dry. Your braids should be less frizzy and look refreshed! [12] X Research source Since the towel is so wet and there’s no way to wring it out because of how hot it is, it’s best to do this in the bathroom or kitchen where it won’t matter if water drips on the floor."

To clean your scalp between washes, try using a baby wipe dipped in 3 parts water mixed with 1 part apple cider vinegar.

And remember, the better you care for your braids while you have them, the longer you can go between getting them done! [18] X Research source The type of braid you use will determine how long you can keep them in. For instance, cornrows aren't going to last as long as box braids.
