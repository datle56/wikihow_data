    {
      "title": "Fill out the required heading information.",
      "content": "Fill out the required heading information. A resignation letter is a formal written notification of your decision to leave your position, so it must be formatted as a traditional letter. When creating the heading, include your full name, job title, phone number, and email address, as well as the date. [1] X Research source This also helps ensure your employer can contact you if needed."
    },
    {
      "title": "Address your letter to the appropriate person.",
      "content": "Address your letter to the appropriate person. This will usually be the principal of your school, though you may also be instructed to address it to your superintendent or the school board. Check with your principal to find out for certain. Then, address the person(s) with their title (Mr., Ms., Dr., etc) and their last name. [2] X Research source For example, “Dear Mr. Jones” or “Dear Dr. Brown.”"

      "title": "State that you are resigning and when.",
      "content": "State that you are resigning and when. It’s important to keep your letter brief, so get right to the point. In the first line of your letter, state that you are resigning. If you already know when your last day will be, include it as well. [3] X Research source For example, “I am writing to inform you that I am resigning from my position at [school]. My final working day will be May 7.” Or, “It is with a heavy heart that I’m writing to formally resign from my position as a math teacher at [school], effective March 3.”"

      "title": "Explain why you are leaving (optional).",
      "content": "Explain why you are leaving (optional). Your employer doesn’t need to know all the details about why you’re resigning, but it can be helpful to give a brief explanation, especially if you’re leaving on good terms. If you’re leaving because of negative experiences, avoid speaking poorly about the school or your coworkers, as this will make the letter seem unprofessional. [4] X Research source For example, “While I have enjoyed my time here at [school], my family and I are moving out of state, so it will be impossible for me to continue my position.” Or, “I will be ending my position here to explore other career paths and opportunities.” If you really want to express specific concerns or frustrations, remember to keep your tone as courteous as possible. For example, say something like “One of my greatest concerns has been…” or “Recent policies such as [x] have left me deeply worried…”"

      "title": "Express gratitude for the opportunities you were given.",
      "content": "Express gratitude for the opportunities you were given. Think about your positive experiences at the school and briefly mention what you liked best or what the job taught you. Thank your employer for the opportunities, as this can help you maintain a positive, professional relationship even after you leave the position. [5] X Research source For example, “I have nothing but good things to say about my time here. Both the teachers and the students have always treated me with the greatest respect and professionalism.” Or, “I’ve learned so much during my time here, from both the students and the other teachers.

Assure them you will finish your duties and are willing to help however you can to support the transition to a new teacher. Include a formal sign-off and sign and print your full name. [6] X Research source For example, “I’ll do everything I can to wrap up my duties in the coming weeks and help any team members who will be taking over for me. Sincerely, [your name]” Or, “I wish the school and the team nothing but the best. Please let me know if I can be of assistance during this transition. Sincerely, [your name]”"

Read back over your letter and look for any instances that may sound harsh or provide too many details. Check for typos and grammatical errors while you’re at it.

      "content": "Avoid using an unprofessional tone. If you’re resigning due to frustrations at work, it’s understandable that you may be annoyed or angry. However, it’s important to remain professional. Keep your tone as courteous as possible. Avoid cursing, complaining, or ranting about the position, your coworkers, or your situation in general. Keeping things professional will help you if you need letters of recommendation in the future. [8] X Research source Similarly, don’t state that you’re resigning due to a conflict or general discontent. This is just a formality—your employer doesn’t need to know all the details. If you’re feeling really frustrated, draft an angry version of your resignation first to get it off your chest. Then, write a more professional version once you’ve calmed down. Just make sure you don’t actually send the angry version!"

Your employer may want to know why you’re leaving, but in general, it’s best to keep your letter of resignation short and sweet, as it’s a formal document. [9] X Research source Don’t dedicate paragraphs to every little detail that led to your choice. If you’d like to discuss your decision in more detail, consider setting up an exit interview with your principal or superintendent."

      "content": "Make sure you’re not breaking any clauses in your contract. Before turning in your resignation, take another look at your contract. Sometimes, teacher contracts may state a specific timeframe in which you should announce your resignation. Turning in your resignation within the required timeframe can help make sure you finish your job as smoothly as possible. [11] X Research source If it isn’t possible for you to turn your notice in within that time frame, try to at least aim for a standard two-week notice."

      "content": "Talk to your principal first. Having a face-to-face conversation about your resignation may feel awkward, but it’s usually the best way to go about it. By discussing your resignation with your principal before writing a letter, you’ll avoid having the administration find out about your decision secondhand. This way, the principal can provide more details about your resignation letter, what it should include, and when you should turn it in. [12] X Research source This also gives you an opportunity to professionally discuss any concerns or issues you’re facing."

Usually, you’ll be required to turn your resignation letter in to the principal of your school, but some districts may require you to give a copy to someone else. If you’re not sure, check your employee handbook or ask your principal. [14] X Research source Typically, you’ll just hand the letter to the principal directly and they’ll take care of it from there.

This is especially helpful if you decide to teach at another school, as it can help you secure future letters of recommendation.
