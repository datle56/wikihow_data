      "content": "Try a tethered GPS override. You'll need to tether your Android or iPhone to your computer using an app like 3uTools (iOS), iMyFone AnyTo (iOS & Android), or Tenorshare iAnyGo (iOS). Some of these GPS spoofers are free, but not all are. This hack fakes your location, allowing you to teleport anywhere in the world. But because location spoofing can get you banned, you must do this hack the right way. To lessen your risk of being banned, don't walk or joystick around in the game. When you want to teleport from point to point, for example, from Washington D.C, USA to Paris, France, close the game, change your location in the app on your computer, and then open the game again. Another tip is to account for real-world transportation times before teleporting again. You can't travel from London to Los Angeles in 2 hours, so wait longer than two hours before making that teleport. Location spoofing is not 100% risk-free or safe—you could get banned if you do this hack improperly. Using a third-party tool to spoof your location can yield great rewards, but ensure that you understand the risks. Avoid using apps like iPogo since they are solely on your phone (e.g., they work without a computer), which is more likely to earn a ban from Niantic. Restart your phone every time you finish using the GPS spoofer on your computer since it will also interfere with your other apps, like Google Maps."

      "content": "Defeat gyms quickly by creating more than one Pokémon Go account. Using more than one account to play Pokémon Go violates Niantic's terms of service, so you'll want to keep that in mind. [1] X Research source Still, using more than one account to dominate gyms and overpower your opponents is extremely common, which means you're unlikely to get caught if you do the hack safely. To use multiple accounts without getting caught, you'll need to have separate devices for your accounts, which is allowed. This is a super easy hack if you have multiple devices that can run Pokémon Go. You can also get more trades, add more bodies to raids, and farm XL quickly."

      "title": "Share an account with a trusted friend.",
      "content": "Share an account with a trusted friend. There are different Pokémon in different regions. Your friend across the world who lives in a climate unlike your own is likely to see different Pokémon than you. You could share your account with them to catch a rare Pokémon, but Niantic keeps track of things such as your location and the devices you use to log in. If this changes frequently, Niantic is more likely to ban the account, assuming it's hacked. If you want to share your Pokémon Go account, it's best if you account for real-world travel times. For example, a flight from Toronto, Canada to Hawaii takes 12 hours, so you'd need to wait 12 hours between your friend in Hawaii logging into your account and then you logging back in from Canada."

      "title": "With the AR camera enabled, you can tell which Pokémon are shiny.",
      "content": "With the AR camera enabled, you can tell which Pokémon are shiny. This is very useful if you want to skip catching non-shiny Pokémon or if you have a short amount of time to catch Pokémon. To do this, enable the AR toggle in your camera when you're viewing a Pokémon (the AR in \"Settings\" must be disabled). The normal camera takes a few seconds longer to show you the Poké Ball and the \"Run Away\" icon, while you'll immediately get to interact with the Pokémon if AR is enabled. Without the normal mode's animation, looking at the Pokémon is much faster! [2] X Research source When you have AR enabled in your camera, you'll be able to see the shiny effects that surround a shiny Pokémon faster than if you have to wait a few extra seconds for the normal camera to zoom out and zoom back in. [3] X Research source Android users can also install third-party \"shiny scanner\" apps that propose to change the appearance of Pokémon on the screen to reveal if they are shiny or Dittos in disguise. That way, Android users don't have to tap on every Pokémon to see if it's special or not."

      "title": "Catch Pokémon faster than normal using two hands.",
      "content": "Catch Pokémon faster than normal using two hands. Normally when you catch a Pokémon, you have to wait for the catching animation to see the message that you caught something. For this trick, you'll most likely want to use two hands instead of one. When you encounter a Pokémon, tap and drag the Poké Balls to the left (you can also do this in reverse and drag the Berries instead). Just tapping the icon will open the pouch, so you want to tap and drag it instead so you see the icon move a little to the left (if you chose to use the Poké Balls icon) or right (if you chose to use the Berries icon). At the same time, without letting go of the icon (Berries or Poké Balls), circle and toss your Poké Ball. It's the Poké Ball in the middle of the screen. If you miss, repeat the steps to drag the Poké Balls or Berries icon and throw your Poké Ball. [4] X Research source As soon as you catch the Pokémon, tap the \"Run Away\" icon in the top left corner of your screen. See if you caught the Pokémon by tapping the Poké Ball at the bottom of your screen, then selecting Pokémon and looking down the list to see if you have it."

      "content": "Most cheat codes online are wrong, but promo codes from Niantic work. Websites will bait you into clicking them with promises of \"GUARANTEED WORKING CODES,\" but they just want clicks and will offer you strings of letters and numbers that aren't working codes for Pokémon Go. Niantic instead offers 'promo codes' that act as a one-time code that you can claim. These codes come from companies that are partnered with Niantic or services like Prime Gaming. These are not random codes that you'll find online listed on a website."

This isn't really a hack, but more of a \"quality of life improvement.\" These wearables will automatically spin PokéStops and attempt to catch Pokémon but don't guarantee the catch rate. You can get the Pokémon Go Plus, Go-tcha, Go-tcha Ranger, Poké Ball Plus, Go-tcha Evolve, and the Brooke Auto Catch Lightning. [5] X Research source A wearable like this is a boon to anyone who wants to keep their phone in their pocket while playing Pokémon Go."
