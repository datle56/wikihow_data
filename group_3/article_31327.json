      "content": "The TikTok theory says no broken bones means you're divinely protected. The TikTok trend claiming to explain what it means if you have never broken a bone began gaining traction late in 2024, with a number of videos on the subject going viral. Some were from the perspective of self-proclaimed spiritual coaches, like user @ridethewav3ss , who referred to those who have never broken a bone as some of “the luckiest individuals alive.” Another trending clip was from user @becomingmemo , who claims in his video that never having broken a bone means that you were meant to face intense trauma and emotional burdens in this lifetime, which is why your body is being divinely protected. The topic has amassed millions of views, and there are countless reaction videos depicting people who have never broken a bone in states of shock and awe, seemingly realizing what it could possibly mean about their past lives."

      "title": "You are being divinely protected.",
      "content": "You are being divinely protected. The most popular spiritual explanation behind the “never broken a bone theory” is that you are being divinely protected by either an angel, another guardian figure, or a member of your family who has passed on to the other side. This belief asserts that someone—or something—is watching out for you from the spiritual realm, protecting you from physical bodily harm. [1] X Research source This protection can be as simple as giving you a gut feeling not to do something. It can also present itself in mysterious, inconvenient, and even frustrating ways, like heavy traffic on your commute to work, to keep you from getting into a car accident that would have happened otherwise. Note: There is zero scientific evidence backing this theory, so if you’ve broken a bone before, it has no bearing on your spiritual well-being."

      "content": "You’ve suffered enough in past lives. This interpretation of the “no broken bones” theory is not as sunny as the first, as this one suggests that your soul has been put through the wringer in past lives. If you’ve never broken a bone in this life, it may be because your body and spirit were both under attack in your previous incarnations, causing you immense suffering. Therefore, your karma in this life is to lead a more peaceful existence, free from pain in the physical sense, at least. [2] X Research source McVey offers a bit more insight into what karma means. She says, “Karma is yourself, living out the contracts you’ve made, bound by your actions and words.” Following McVey’s thought process, having no broken bones in this life could mean that you’ve ultimately honored your karmic contract, allowing you to finally be free of things that once plagued you. A similar explanation could be that you’ve racked up enough good karma points in past lives to keep you from getting hurt in this life."

      "title": "Your energies are very well aligned.",
      "content": "Your energies are very well aligned. This reasoning implies that you’ve never broken a bone due to an excellent energy field, which is keeping you safe and protected. Whether it’s perfectly aligned chakras , tapping into your auric powers , or some kind of divine energetic intervention working in your favor, your energy shields are certainly up and running. Lucky you! McVey details how you can tap into your aura and chakras to surround yourself in a golden, protective light. She instructs, “Focus on bringing light down through the top of your head so you can feel it in your entire body, and then let it beam outward from whichever chakra you're most comfortable, pushing out everything that’s icky and negative.” Once you’ve achieved this, you’ll find yourself surrounded in a golden light. “Gold is the color of the highest vibration,” she shares. “It's like the protective color of God's light. That's why we use it.”"

      "content": "You’re on your final earthly incarnation. Another karmic explanation for never breaking a bone is that you’re on your last life in this earthly realm. Buddhism revolves around the concept of karma, death, and rebirth, believing the goal to be an end to suffering, which can only happen once we’ve paid off all our karmic debt . If we do manage to do this, it means nirvana is near, resulting in final incarnations on earth that are more likely to be pleasant and peaceful. [3] X Research source McVey offers good advice on how not to acquire any karmic debt in the first place. She says, “Honestly, just don’t be a jerk. Don’t do anything out of malice, anger, or a need for revenge.” She warns that it really is the thought that counts, and that alone can lead to karmic debts: “It doesn’t matter if the bad thing you wanted to happen to someone happened or not— you still wanted that for them. So, try to keep your thoughts pure.”"

      "title": "Three main verses in the Bible discuss the meaning behind having unbroken bones.",
      "content": "Three main verses in the Bible discuss the meaning behind having unbroken bones. Although the “never broken a bone” theory has made its way into pop culture via TikTok, it may have roots in the Bible. Books in both the Old Testament and the New Testament can tell us a lot about God’s treatment of bones in the body, offering some support to the idea that a sound body is a result of divine protection. [4] X Research source Psalms 34:19: “The righteous person may have many troubles, but the Lord delivers him from them all; he protects all his bones, not one of them will be broken.” This verse conveys God’s mercy for all believers, detailing his intention to protect everyone who is righteous and faithful to him by keeping their bones, and by extension, their bodies, intact. Exodus 12:46: “It must be eaten inside the house; take none of the meat outside the house. Do not break any of the bones.” This verse instructed Jewish people how to properly slaughter the lamb at Passover, careful not to break its bones in the process. This could be interpreted as a means of keeping the lamb whole and perfect, possibly foreshadowing Jesus’ crucifixion later on. John 19:33-36: “But when they came to Jesus and found that he was already dead, they did not break his legs. Instead, one of the soldiers pierced Jesus’ side with a spear, bringing a sudden flow of blood and water. The man who saw it has given testimony, and his testimony is true[...] These things happened so that the scripture would be fulfilled: ‘Not one of his bones will be broken.’” While it was customary to break the legs of those being crucified, this verse states that Jesus’ legs remained unbroken. This extends the metaphor of the lamb by painting Jesus in the same unbroken light."

      "content": "There is no science behind the “no broken bones” theory. The “no broken bones” theory going viral on TikTok may have some spiritual support, but there’s no science to back a relationship between bone health, the likelihood of breaking a bone, and spiritual intervention. [5] X Research source The average adult human has about 206 bones, which are made up of collagen and calcium phosphate. Certain genetic factors that affect bone density can play a role in determining how likely you are to break a bone, but breaking a bone is still generally accidental and circumstantial. Bone injuries hurt and can take months to heal, depending on the bone and severity. Certain breaks may have to be “set” by the doctor, or otherwise treated with a splint, cast, or brace. To avoid broken bones, wear equipment like helmets and knee pads when participating in certain activities. Exercise is also important to bone health. Eating a healthy diet rich in calcium and vitamin D can also help strengthen your bones and prevent injury."

      "content": "The “never broke a bone” theory is fun, but it’s not rooted in evidence. There is no scientific basis for the “no broken bones” theory, and whether or not you’ve broken a bone is largely related to circumstance and genetics. So, although you may be lucky to have never broken a bone, it doesn’t necessarily mean you’re spiritually protected, “blessed,” or lead a more divinely favored life than those who have broken a bone."
