Consider taking turns selecting vacation spots. If you decide to go with your first choice this year, let another travel partner select the next vacation destination. Find a happy medium. If everyone’s first choice for a destination is widely different, find one that everyone would like, even if it is not on the top of their list. Pick a destination out of a hat. If there is no compromise on the horizon, let fate choose for you. Write down all of the destinations and put them in a jar or a hat. Then have someone (ideally, an unbiased third party) pull a name out. That’s where you’ll go!"

      "content": "Consider all transportation needs. Reaching your destination is only one transportation consideration. Once you have arrived in the area, you will need to figure out how to get from the airport, train station, or bus station to your hotel. You may also have plans to travel locally while on vacation. Call the concierge at the hotel you’re staying at and ask whether the hotel offers complimentary or reduced-fee shuttle service to and from the airport. If they don’t, ask for any advice on local ground transportation. Rent a vehicle if you will need to get around a lot once you have reached your destination. If you’ll be doing a lot of sight-seeing in areas that are spread out, a rental car will be a better option than taxi services. Be sure you know your hotel’s parking policies and fees. If you don’t plan to leave your destination once you get there (for example, if you’re staying at an all-inclusive resort), you may not need a rental car. Consider a taxi or shuttle from the airport instead. If you are going to an urban area, search online for the city’s public transportation options. Areas with subways, trains, or bus systems often offer daily or weekly passes that are much cheaper than rental car fees."

Friends or family may have a guest room that you can stay in. If you vacation somewhere that you have connections, ask around. You may be surprised at the hospitality of even somewhat distant acquaintances. Local bed and breakfasts often offer more charm and personalized service than traditional hotels. Many vacation spots have condos, houses, or cabins that individual owners rent out themselves or through property management services. Try searching online for “house rental” + your destination. Renting a recreational vehicle (RV) or motor home may be a good option for traveling. The RV functions as both your travel vehicle and your hotel room. Camping is a fun option for anyone who loves being outdoors. Some camping areas and state parks offer amenities such as bathrooms and showers, so it doesn’t have to be “roughing it” completely!"

Be sure to include or even pre-pack very important things, like medications. Be sure to fill any necessary medical prescriptions before leaving for vacation. Be sure you know about the weather of your vacation spot so that you can dress appropriately while you are there. You may want to pack a few layers to allow for unusual weather. Search online for vacation checklists. There are helpful resources that guide you in packing for different circumstances. If you are flying, be aware that many airlines charge customers per bag, so packing light will save you money. In addition to limits to the number of bags, most airlines limit the weight of each bag and will charge exorbitant fees for overweight bags. Regardless of your mode of travel, consider packing a first aid kit, snacks, and entertainment for the travel time. Car trips and air travel both involve long periods of potential boredom, so consider bringing along games or activities for the travelers, especially if you are traveling with children."

Some may charge a deposit or restrict dog breeds. Boarding your pet at a vet or a kennel may be an option. Be sure you know about the pickup and drop-off times so you can retrieve your pet appropriately upon your return. Hiring a pet sitter to come to your home may be the best option for animals who do not adapt well to new environments. If you have dogs, be sure that the pet sitter has been to your house (several times if possible) while you are home so that the dogs understand that the person is allowed to be in the house."
