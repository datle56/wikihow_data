If they do, try switching to a different multivitamin in order to reduce symptoms that may be caused by an excess amount of the vitamin in your body. [5] X Research source"

[15] X Expert Source Courtney Foster Licensed Cosmetologist Expert Interview. 9 December 2019. [16] X Research source Your hair may be much less oily while you are taking Accutane than it previously was, which may mean that you don't need to shampoo your hair as often. Shampooing your hair too often can worsen the dryness, so only shampoo it as often as necessary to keep it looking clean. While many alcohols are bad for dry hair, Cetearyl alcohol, Cetyl alcohol, and Stearyl alcohol will actually help it retain moisture. Look for a shampoo that will help lower the Ph of your hair, as this will also help it retain moisture. Fragrance-free shampoos are a good choice for dry hair. Sulfates are not necessarily bad for your hair, but they are known to strip the oil from your hair. If your hair is excessively dry while you are taking Accutane, you may want to look for sulfate-free options.
