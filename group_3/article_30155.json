      "title": "Choose and cut your flowers.",
      "content": "Choose and cut your flowers. Select a main flower, accent flowers, and greenery that match your desired color scheme. Use scissors or wire cutters to cut the stems down to about 1/2-1 inch (1.3-2.5 cm) and remove any excess foliage. Try to choose sturdy flowers that can withstand some wear—they’ll look better at the end of the night than delicate flowers. [1] X Research source Some popular flower options include roses, daisies, orchids, and lilies. Plan on getting 3 to 5 blooms, depending on their size. Some popular accent flowers include baby’s breath, fern leaves, and eucalyptus. Accent flowers add fullness to the corsage and highlight the color of the main flower. Use fresh or fake flowers for your corsage. If you use real flowers, pick flowers that are close to fully blooming and keep them in water before you make the corsage. Usually, the color scheme of a corsage matches that of your dress or suit. Alternatively, consider using your school colors if you’re making one for prom. Or, look at an interior design color wheel for inspiration."

      "content": "Wrap the stems with floral wire and floral tape. Arrange your primary flowers however you like, then tie the stems together by wrapping floral wire around them, starting from the top of the stem downward. Use wire cutters to cut off the excess wire, then wrap the stems with floral tape . The tape will hide the wire from view and protect the wearer’s wrist from sharp edges. Repeat the process with a bundle of your accent flowers. [2] X Research source For the best results, wrap the tape at a diagonal, like the stripes on a barber pole. It may take two rounds of tape to completely cover the stems."

      "content": "Arrange and secure your mini bouquet with ribbon. After both bundles have been wrapped, position them how you’d like them to sit on your wrist and wrap them together with more floral tape. Wrap a thin ribbon of your choosing around the stems so that it covers the tape and looks nice and neat. Make sure to leave enough excess ribbon on both ends so that you can attach it to the main ribbon that wraps around your wrist. [3] X Research source If you’re using fake flowers, another option is to hot glue the bouquet to the ribbon. Don’t use hot glue on real flowers, however, as it will damage them. If you want to add other embellishments, like pearls, lace, or charms, now is the time to do so. Attach them to real flowers using floral wire, or feel free to hot glue them if your corsage is made of fake flowers."

      "content": "Attach the mini bouquet to the corsage ribbon. Cut another piece of ribbon that’s long enough to wrap around your wrist and make a bow. Find the center of the ribbon and tie your mini bouquet to it. Place the corsage on your wrist and secure it with a bow on the same side as the floral arrangement. Alternatively, tie or glue your corsage to a wristband or corsage bracelet instead. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Make a fresh flower corsage a day before your event. If you’re making a corsage with real flowers, ensure they’re at their freshest by making the corsage no more than a day or two before your event. If you have time, it may be optimal to make the corsage the morning of the event instead. If you’re using fake flowers, it’s okay to make your corsage whenever you’d like. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Traditionally, a corsage is worn on the left wrist. Because most people are right-handed, the corsage is traditionally worn on the left wrist. Simply wrap the ribbon around your wrist and secure it with a bow. It’s also okay to wear a corsage on your right wrist, pinned to your dress, or attached to a hat. [6] X Research source Corsages are often worn to prom or homecoming, at weddings, or for other formal events."

      "title": "Why is it called a corsage?",
      "content": "Why is it called a corsage? The word corsage comes from the 15th-century French word “cors,” which means “body.” By the 1800s, the word had come to refer to the bodice of a dress, and flowers fashioned for a bodice were called “bouquet de corsage.” Later on, the placement of the corsage would move from the bodice to the wrist or shoulder so that a woman’s date could pin the flowers on her without being inappropriate.
