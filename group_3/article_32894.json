If you know the weather is going to dip into colder territory, plant your seeds in pots so you can bring it inside when you need to.

      "content": "Soak the seeds in water for 12 hours to soften the casings. Butterfly pea seeds need water to open up and get their shoots ready. Pour your seeds into a bowl, then cover them in water and let them sit overnight. [2] X Research source You can find seeds at most garden supply stores, or you can get them out of the pods that grow on butterfly pea vines. You can also use cuttings from an existing flower as long as they have roots attached."

Mix together equal parts of sand, compost, and potting soil to make a well-draining mixture, then fill your pot up all the way.

      "content": "Dig a small hole about 1 in (2.5 cm) deep in the soil. The hole doesn’t have to be very deep—about 1 in (2.5 cm) is fine. Poke 1 finger into the soil and make a little opening for the seed to nestle into. [4] X Research source Since butterfly pea vines grow several feet around the plant, use 1 seed per pot."

      "content": "Put 1 seed in the hole and cover it with soil. Gently smooth the potting soil over the hole to cover it up, but don’t tamp down super hard. You only need to plant 1 seed in each hole since butterfly pea flower seeds are usually very successful. [5] X Research source If you smash the dirt down on top of the seed, the soil won’t drain well."

Make sure the dirt is wet, and don’t stop watering until you can hear water running out of the drainage holes at the bottom of the pot. [6] X Research source The water will help to settle the dirt around the seed and get it ready for germination."

The more sun this plant gets, the better! [10] X Research source Try watching your yard throughout the day to see which area gets the most light. If you’re planting your flowers in a pot, you can put them next to a window or on your balcony."

If there’s still puddles of water after 1 to 2 hours, it’s probably not a good location for the pea flower. If the soil drains quickly and looks sandy, that’s a good spot to pick.

Butterfly pea flowers can’t flourish without a structure, so this is very important! [12] X Research source You could also plant it near a small shrub or tree to climb."

Grab your hose or watering can and soak the soil around the plant every day until it’s moist but not soaking wet. [17] X Research source This is why well-draining soil is so important! If any of the water pools up on top of the plant, it could drown. If you’re getting a heavy rainfall that day, don’t worry about watering."

      "content": "Prune the vine back when it gets heavy or too bushy. Most butterfly pea plants don’t need a ton of pruning, but their leaves can pull down on the vine if they grow too much. Use sharp pruners to cut the leaves back in the spring, leaving at least 7 to 10 centimetres (2.8 to 3.9 in) of the vine intact so it can keep growing. [18] X Research source Pruning isn’t strictly necessary, but it can be nice for aesthetic purposes. You can also prune the vines back if they’re starting to take over other plants in your garden. Butterfly pea plants tend to spread outwards, not up, so they do have the potential to kill any groundcover in the area."

Spread them out in the sun and wait a few weeks for the flowers to dry before you store them. [20] X Research source Butterfly pea flowers are perennials, so they’ll continue to bloom year after year even if you take the flowers off."
