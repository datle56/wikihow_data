      "content": "Remove any stains from the clothes. If you can easily get the stains out yourself with bleach or a Tide pen, remove the stains yourself. However, if the clothing is delicate or difficult to clean, take it to a dry-cleaner to have any stains removed. If the article of clothing has very minor staining, it may not be worth it to pay for dry-cleaning. Instead, you could reduce the price accordingly, be upfront about stains, photograph them well, and let the buyer handle removal. This is especially important with vintage or antique clothes, which can be fragile and easily damaged."

      "content": "Inspect the clothing closely for other flaws. Look over each piece for issues such as loose threads, missing buttons, rips, or broken zippers. You can fix most of these small problems yourself by trimming hanging threads or sewing matching buttons back on. However, issues like broken zippers or major rips are not as easily fixed. Document any un-fixable issues in your listing and be upfront with the buyer when you sell the garment."

      "content": "Hire a model if you have enough of a budget to do so. Seeing the clothes on the model gives the customer a better idea of what the clothes will look like in real life. A good model can also more clearly appeal to your target market. For example, if you’re selling your clothes with teenagers in mind, having a teen model will draw in teens and help them imagine how it would look on them. You could also ask a friend to help you out with the modeling. To save money, use a mannequin or dummy for the basic side, front, back, and close-up detail shots, and use the model to show what the article of clothing looks like when it’s paired with an outfit. [10] X Research source If you go with a model, remember that the focus of your shoot should be the clothes, not the model wearing them.

      "content": "Use flat lay photos to showcase the item in a simple, clean way. You can easily create a flat lay photo by laying out and arranging an article of clothing on a flat background, then shooting straight down at the garment. To add the illusion of depth to the clothes, use techniques such as tucking in fabric around the underarm area or adding tissue paper inside the clothes. The flat lay format works best with skirts, sweaters, shoes, scarves, handbags, towels, and kids wear. If you don’t have the budget for a model or a mannequin, this technique is a simple, affordable alternative."

You should also take clear photos of any imperfections in the clothing, such as stains, rips, or tears. Customers will trust you much more as a buyer when you provide clear, upfront information about the garments."

If you hire a model, have them try several different poses for each outfit, such as a hand behind their head or with their hands in their pockets. Make sure the poses you’re using don’t cover up too much of the product with accessories or hands. [15] X Research source For example, if you’re photographing a flowy dress, you could have the model hold out the sides of the dress to show off the fabric. If you’re photographing a men’s winter jacket, you could have the model turn slightly to the side and put his hands in the pockets. Avoid sitting, jump shots, or motion shots that might blur or distract from the garment itself."

Pick several of the best photos for each garment listing, including 1 shot from each of the front, back, and side angles, as well as a close-up shot that shows the garment’s texture. If you’re selling new clothes, you should also include a photo of a model wearing the piece as part of an outfit. If you’re selling used clothes, add several photos of tags, care instructions, or imperfections."
