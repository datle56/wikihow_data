      "content": "Put a little green and blue paint on your palette. Glop a small amount of blue (cyan, cerulean, phthalo, etc) paint on one side of your palette , and squeeze a bit of green paint on the other side. If you don't have green paint, you can make it by mixing equal parts blue and yellow paint. Hattas Wilson mentions that you can also add a bit of white or black to create a paler or more subdued green if you’d like. If you don't have a dedicated painting palette, feel free to mix your paints on any clean, dry surface, such as a paper plate or a strip of cardboard."

      "content": "Keep adding a little at a time to create a 2:1 ratio of blue to green paint. Turquoise contains more blue pigment than green, so try using twice as much blue paint as green paint to start. [1] X Research source Put one small paintbrush-scoop of green onto your palette, then mix that glob with two scoops of blue. Continue to mix the paints together until they're completely combined into one color. Assess the color, then feel free to experiment with different ratios to get the exact turquoise hue you want. For example, if you want a more deep sea-green type of turquoise, add in a bit more green after your first round of mixing. Mix again, then see if it’s the right shade for your project."

      "title": "Add small amounts of white, black, or yellow to tweak the color.",
      "content": "Add small amounts of white, black, or yellow to tweak the color. Once you're done mixing the blue and green together, look it over to make sure you're happy with the color. Try painting the sample onto a piece of scrap paper—it may look a little different when it’s spread. If you aren't satisfied, try adding small, intentional increments of yellow, white, or black paint until you have exactly the hue you need. To make the color lighter, brighter, and more vibrant, add some yellow. To make the color paler, more subtle, and more pastel-like, add some white. To make the color deeper and more muted, and some black. Start small and only add a bit of these paints at a time."

    {
      "title": "Use white as the base color.",
      "content": "Use white as the base color. If you want to mix an especially pale shade of turquoise, start with white or a very light blue. White paint will make up the bulk of the mixture, so use about as much white paint as you think you'll need."

      "title": "Mix the paint using a 2:1:4 ratio of blue:green:white.",
      "content": "Mix the paint using a 2:1:4 ratio of blue:green:white. There is no single correct way to mix a pale turquoise, so you will need to feel out the ratio for yourself. Start small, with just a few drops of blue and green in the midst of the white paint, and mix the parts together until you have a uniform hue. Gauge whether you want a brighter turquoise, or an even paler turquoise, and add more blue or white paint accordingly. Remember—until you start painting, you can always adjust the pigment ratio in your turquoise. Make sure that you're satisfied before you settle down to paint. Make sure to use at least as much paint as you'll need to complete your project. It can be a complex process to try to replicate paint-mixture ratios once you've already painted half of the piece. If you ever want to replicate this color, write down the precise ratio you used."

      "title": "Decide which shade of turquoise you want.",
      "content": "Decide which shade of turquoise you want. Turquoise falls between blue and green on the color wheel, so you can achieve this color by mixing blue and green paint together. [2] X Research source However, Morozin explains that a more muted turquoise would also have a little black in it, while a pale or light turquoise would include a little white, so you’ll need to decide what type of turquoise you’re going for before picking your paints."

      "title": "Buy blue and green paint.",
      "content": "Buy blue and green paint. Mixing blue and green will create turquoise in any medium (acrylic, oil, watercolor, etc.). However, if you’re new to painting you might want to start with acrylics , since they’re a forgiving and easy-to-mix medium, and you can buy them in small, cheap squeeze-bottles. If you buy your paint at an art supply store, the staff might be able to suggest specific green and blue hues to mix the shade you want, but here are some tips to consider as well: Blues: Use a blue that is more green-ish than purple-ish. Phthalo blue is likely the best choice if you can find it. In fact, Morozin says all you’d need to do is mix the phthalo with a bit of white, and “you’ll get beautiful turquoise immediately.” Other blue paints that work well include cyan , cobalt , cerulean , and ultramarine . [3] X Research source Premixed turquoise paint: You may be able to find a pre-mixed turquoise paint that serves your purposes, which would be the easiest option. If you start with a paint that’s already turquoise, you can also add tiny dollops of blue, green, white, or yellow to minutely tweak the pigment to get the color you need."

      "title": "Buy white, yellow, or black paint for different tints and hues.",
      "content": "Buy white, yellow, or black paint for different tints and hues. A tint is created when you add white to a color, and a shade is created when you add black. So, if you’re going for a lighter, almost pastel-like tint, you’ll want to buy some white paint , and if you’re going for a muted, more subdued turquoise, you’ll want to buy some black paint . [4] X Research source If you want vibrant and bright, turquoise you may want to buy a bit of yellow paint to mix in. Consider getting different hues of white depending on your vision. For example, you might choose a warm off-white as a base for turquoise when painting a tropical beach scene, but you might want a starker, more \"artificial\" white as the base if you’re painting a cold and distant turquoise planet."

      "title": "Is turquoise more blue or green?",
      "content": "Is turquoise more blue or green? Turquoise tends to lean more toward blue than green. A starting point to mix turquoise is 2 parts blue paint to 1 part green paint, meaning that there’s usually double the amount of blue to green in a basic turquoise color. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Is cyan the same thing as turquoise? Like turquoise, cyan sits between blue and green on the color wheel. [6] X Research source As a result, it could be considered a type of turquoise, but it’s not quite the same thing, since turquoise comes in various shades, hues, and tints."
