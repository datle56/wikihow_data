      "content": "Unscrew the threaded screw. Some anchors have threaded screws that need to be removed before you can reach the collar. In these cases, use a screwdriver to turn the screw counterclockwise until it is loose, and then remove it. [1] X Research source If the screw has a cross slot on top, remove it with a Phillips-head screwdriver. This is the most common type of screw used in drywall anchors."

[2] X Expert Source Ryaan Tuttle Home Improvement Specialist Expert Interview. 30 July 2021. Grab the edge of the collar, then pull out and snap it off. [3] X Research source The collar is a small circular piece of metal that holds the anchor in place, so that it cannot be pushed backward, out the other end of the wall. Be gentle when you attach the pliers. You don’t want to gouge the drywall. Try to avoid touching the drywall with the pliers. If the anchor is tight or stuck, place a flat-head screwdriver or pry bar under the head of the anchor to ease it out."

      "content": "Press the tip of a screwdriver into the hole where the wall anchor is lodged. Once the anchor has been removed, you can use a screwdriver to push the anchor out through the other end of the wall. The screwdriver shouldn’t be larger than the diameter of the wall anchor because you will want to be able to push it through the wall without making the hole bigger. [4] X Research source You can also use a 1 ⁄ 4 in (0.64 cm) drill bit to drill out the insert. [5] X Expert Source Ryaan Tuttle Home Improvement Specialist Expert Interview. 30 July 2021."

      "content": "Push the anchor through the wall with a screwdriver. The wall anchor should fall into the frame, behind the drywall. You will be left with a small hole to patch. Another option is to place a Phillips-head screwdriver in the anchor. Tap it gently with a hammer. Once it is pushed slightly into the wall, apply joint compound over it to smooth out the hole."

Do not push the blade toward the wall, or you could damage the surface of the drywall. [6] X Research source This method works well on plastic anchors, not metal ones."
