      "content": "Clean and cut 1 lb (450 g) of carrots into 0.25 in (6.4 mm) sticks or rounds. Wash whole carrots under running water, pat them dry, and use a vegetable peeler to remove the tough outer layer. Then, use a sharp knife to trim off the stem and tip of each carrot, and cut them into either thin sticks or sliced rounds. [1] X Research source You can also use bagged baby carrots. These come pre-washed, but you might choose to give them another rinse and pat them dry. You can cook them whole, or slice each into 2-3 pieces."

      "content": "Add the carrots and 2 US tbsp (30 mL) of water to a microwavable dish. Choose a large, microwave-safe dish (glass or ceramic is best) that provides plenty of extra room for the carrots and water. [2] X Research source Never use a metal bowl in the microwave. If you must use a plastic bowl, make sure it is labeled as microwave-safe."

      "title": "Cover the dish with its lid or plastic wrap.",
      "content": "Cover the dish with its lid or plastic wrap. Don’t tilt the lid or poke holes in the plastic wrap for venting. You want to trap the water inside the bowl in order to steam the carrots. [3] X Research source Plastic wrap might melt if it is touching the carrots. If necessary, use a larger bowl."

      "content": "Cook the carrots on high (100%) power for 3 ½ minutes. After the microwave stops running, remove the bowl with oven mitts—it will be hot! Remove the lid or plastic wrap carefully, keeping any escaping steam away from your arms and face. [4] X Research source The cooking times for this recipe assume a 1000 watt microwave. If you have a higher wattage microwave, reduce the time to 3 minutes; if it’s lower, increase the time to 4 minutes."

      "title": "Stir the carrots, re-cover them, and keep cooking them until tender.",
      "content": "Stir the carrots, re-cover them, and keep cooking them until tender. Once you’ve stirred the carrots and re-covered the bowl, cook them on high for another 2 minutes. Then, remove them again and check them for doneness with a fork—it should pierce the carrot pieces with little resistance. If they’re not done yet, microwave them for another minute and keep repeating the process as needed. [5] X Research source Thin slices will take about 6-9 minutes in total. Strips will take about 5-7 minutes in total. Whole baby carrots will take about 7-9 minutes in total."

[6] X Research source Steamed carrots can be added to many meals as a side dish or vegetable accompaniment. Try them with a grilled chicken breast or broiled fish, for example."

Keep an eye on it, because butter can burn quickly in a microwave. [8] X Research source Use a ceramic, glass, or other microwave-safe bowl that has more than enough room for adding the carrots after the butter melts."

Stir the orange zest and brown sugar into the butter until the sugar dissolves. [9] X Research source Alternatively, try replacing the brown sugar with 1 US tbsp (15 mL) of maple syrup or honey."
