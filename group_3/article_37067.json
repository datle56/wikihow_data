      "title": "Inspect your fridge’s door seal for damage or tears.",
      "content": "Inspect your fridge’s door seal for damage or tears. Open your fridge and look at the rubber seal around the perimeter of the door. If you notice there are any large cracks or holes in the rubber, it’s time for a replacement. [1] X Research source If you notice any mold on the gasket, it’s a good sign there’s damage that might not be visible. Fridge gaskets keep cold air in and heat out of the refrigerator. If your seal has cracks or damage, temperatures in the refrigerator could increase and cause food inside to spoil more quickly. It will also cost you more money in energy."

      "title": "Slide a dollar bill between the gasket and fridge to check for a loose seal.",
      "content": "Slide a dollar bill between the gasket and fridge to check for a loose seal. Put the dollar bill between the refrigerator door and refrigerator, and close the door on it. Then, try to pull the bill straight out from the seal. If you feel the dollar drag slightly, your gasket is still in good condition. If the bill slips out quickly or has moisture on it, then it’s time for a door seal replacement. [2] X Research source Alternatively, check for additional ice or moisture buildup inside your fridge and freezer. Moisture forms when warm air from outside leaks into your fridge through the seal and condenses into water droplets. Fixing the seal will help prevent ice build-up . If you don't see any problems but your fridge still isn't working properly, check other fridge components like the condenser to see if they're working properly."

      "content": "Try fixing minor cracks in an old gasket with silicone sealant . Apply a bead of silicone sealant along the edge of the crack. Slowly close the refrigerator door and leave it shut overnight. Check the door seal again in the morning to see if the sealant filled in the crack. [3] X Research source Silicone sealant only works for fixing minor cracks, and it’s not a permanent solution. More cracks and gaps will eventually form in the door seal, so you’ll need to replace it then."

      "title": "Buy a door seal that matches your fridge.",
      "content": "Buy a door seal that matches your fridge. Check your refrigerator’s manual or look for a sticker inside of your fridge to find the exact model number. Look for a new gasket at a hardware store or on the manufacturer’s website and ensure the one you get matches the size of your door. [4] X Expert Source Aaron Beth Appliance Technician Expert Interview. 14 July 2020. Fridge door seals usually range from $30–50 USD If you can’t find your owner’s manual, search your fridge’s make and model online to find the correct gasket."

      "title": "Tape the gasket down for 1–2 days if it has twists.",
      "content": "Tape the gasket down for 1–2 days if it has twists. Lay the gasket flat on the floor or a table. If any areas look twisted or raised, tape them down so they lie flat. Leave the gasket in place for at least 1 day so it has time to flatten out into the proper shape. [5] X Research source Alternatively, set lightweight objects on the gasket to hold it in place. Just make sure the objects aren’t so heavy that they squish the gasket down."

      "title": "Soak warped areas of the gasket in warm water.",
      "content": "Soak warped areas of the gasket in warm water. Heat up a bowl of water in your microwave so it’s warm but not boiling hot. Slowly dip the warped section of the door seal in the water and leave it submerged for a couple of minutes. Then, rub the gasket with your fingers to help straighten out the rubber. Dry the gasket off completely before you install it. [6] X Research source Warming the gasket makes it more malleable so it’s easier to reshape."

      "title": "Lift the edge of the door seal to check for a metal retainer.",
      "content": "Lift the edge of the door seal to check for a metal retainer. Unplug your fridge to save energy while you work, then open your fridge door and grab the bottom inside edge of the gasket. Pull the gasket back to see if there’s a metal retainer, which is a flat piece screwed into the fridge door. If there’s a retainer with screws, then have a hex-head screwdriver ready. [7] X Research source If there isn’t a metal retainer, then the gasket will come off of your fridge door easily."
    },
    {
      "title": "Loosen the screws on the metal retainer without removing them.",
      "content": "Loosen the screws on the metal retainer without removing them. Lift the edges of the seal to find the screws underneath. Turn the screws counter-clockwise to loosen them slightly. Just make sure not to completely take the screws out so you don’t lose them. Work your way around the entire door removing the screws. [8] X Research source The screws secure the gasket between a plastic door liner and the actual fridge door."

    {
      "title": "Pull the gasket out of the door.",
      "content": "Pull the gasket out of the door. Once all of the screws are loose, hold the door’s seal by one of the corners. Pull the corner up and away from the fridge door so it easily slides out from behind the plastic liner. Just be careful not to be too forceful since some plastic liners are quite brittle and could break if you’re too rough. [9] X Research source If the seal is stuck or glued onto your fridge door, slide a putty knife underneath to help loosen it. Toss the old gasket in the trash or contact your local waste collection service to see if you can recycle it."

      "title": "Push the new gasket into the groove on your fridge door.",
      "content": "Push the new gasket into the groove on your fridge door. Position one of the gasket’s corners on the top of the refrigerator door. If your fridge door has a metal retainer, push the lip of the new gasket behind the retainer. Otherwise, use your thumb to push the gasket into the recessed groove around the perimeter of the refrigerator door. [10] X Research source It’s okay if the gasket doesn’t sit perfectly flush right away since you’ll be able to make slight adjustments to fix any warps."

    {
      "title": "Push a stubborn seal behind the liner with a screwdriver.",
      "content": "Push a stubborn seal behind the liner with a screwdriver. If the lip doesn’t slide into the groove around your fridge door, push it in a flathead screwdriver. Slide the end of the screwdriver between the door and the liner. Hold the gasket down with your other hand before taking out the screwdriver so the seal doesn’t come out with it. [11] X Research source After you put the screwdriver in behind the liner, pry it forward slightly to help the gasket slip in."

    {
      "title": "Screw the metal retainer back in if your fridge has one.",
      "content": "Screw the metal retainer back in if your fridge has one. Turn the screws clockwise to tighten them until they feel snug. Go around the perimeter of your refrigerator door to secure all of the screws. [12] X Research source Avoid forcing or over-tightening the screws so you don’t damage the liner."

      "title": "Apply baby or talcum powder around the door seal.",
      "content": "Apply baby or talcum powder around the door seal. Shake a little bit of the powder into your hand and rub it around the sides and corners of the new gasket. The powder helps reduce friction and prevents the door seal from twisting when you open and close the door."

    {
      "title": "Rub petroleum jelly on the seal along the hinged side of the door.",
      "content": "Rub petroleum jelly on the seal along the hinged side of the door. Take a fingertip-sized amount and spread it over the gasket’s surface on the side with the hinges. Spread the petroleum jelly in a thin, even layer. [13] X Research source Petroleum jelly helps the door seal slide against your fridge when you open and close the door so it doesn’t twist or warp."

      "title": "Open and close your fridge door to check for gaps in the seal.",
      "content": "Open and close your fridge door to check for gaps in the seal. Slowly close your fridge and inspect the gasket for any warped areas. Run your finger around the edge of your fridge door to make sure the seal sits flush against your fridge. Then, open the door to ensure the seal doesn’t drag or twist against the fridge. [14] X Research source If you notice warps in the gasket, try heating the rubber with a hair dryer on low heat to make it fit against your fridge better."
