      "content": "Put soundproof paneling on the walls. You can also reduce noise in your cubicle by lining the walls inside the cubicle with soundproof foam or fabric. Look for acoustical foam, sound-reducing fabric, or mass-loaded vinyl (MLV) barriers that can be mounted directly on your walls. [2] X Research source For maximum noise reduction, cover as much of the inside surface of your cubicle walls as possible."

      "content": "Close any cracks or crevices with open-cell foam. Noise can enter your cubicle through the spaces between and under the wall panels. Get some foam wedges, weather strips, or a big block of foam you can cut to the desired size and shape. Use the foam to block any small spaces where noise might be coming in. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Get a privacy door, if your cubicle doesn’t have one.",
      "content": "Get a privacy door, if your cubicle doesn’t have one. The entrance to your cubicle can be a major entryway for unwanted noise. Many office supply retailers carry sliding doors or screens that can be attached to cubicle walls. These can help block out noise and send a signal to your coworkers that you don’t want to be disturbed. Do a search for “cubicle privacy screen” or “cubicle privacy door.”"

      "title": "Add insulation to any cubicle windows.",
      "content": "Add insulation to any cubicle windows. Cubicle windows are great for brightening up your workspace, but sound can travel through window glass. Covering any windows with a thin film of plastic can help block out some noise while still letting in light. [4] X Research source Look for window insulation film at your local hardware or home supply store."

      "title": "Install a white noise machine under your desk.",
      "content": "Install a white noise machine under your desk. White noise machines are a great way to drown out annoying background sounds. White noise is a neutral sound that your brain can easily tune out. Look for a small white noise unit that you can fit easily under your desk or in another out-of-the-way part of your workspace. [5] X Research source If you don’t want to buy a white noise machine, try searching for an online white noise generator and playing the sound over your computer speakers or headphones. This website creates subtle, adjustable white noise: https://mynoise.net/NoiseMachines/whiteNoiseGenerator.php"

      "title": "Listen to music over headphones or earbuds.",
      "content": "Listen to music over headphones or earbuds. If you’re allowed to use headphones or earbuds on the job, this can be a great way to tune out noise. For maximum benefits, invest in a set of noise-cancelling headphones. [6] X Research source Select low-key instrumental music without vocals. Music with lyrics or loud, upbeat tunes can be distracting when you are trying to work."

      "title": "Wear noise-cancelling earplugs or earmuffs.",
      "content": "Wear noise-cancelling earplugs or earmuffs. If the noises around you are really bothersome and other methods just aren’t cutting it, you can block out sounds with earplugs or earmuffs that are designed to reduce noise. Make sure you are still able to hear any sounds that you might need to pick up on, like your office phone ringing or your boss trying to get your attention."

      "title": "Have a conversation with your noisy coworker(s)",
      "content": "Have a conversation with your noisy coworker(s) . If the noise problem in your office is being caused by a coworker’s habits, it might be helpful to politely ask them to keep it down. Take them aside privately, and keep the conversation respectful and non-accusatory. For example, you might say, “Cassandra, I know you like listening to the radio in your cubicle, but I have a really hard time concentrating on my work when music is playing. Would you mind listening over headphones?”"

      "title": "Talk to your office manager about reducing noise.",
      "content": "Talk to your office manager about reducing noise. If your office is really noisy, it may be worthwhile to bring up the issue with HR or your boss. Consider suggesting solutions such as installing noise-reducing floor mats, moving noisy office equipment farther away from the cubicles, or putting new policies in place regarding playing music during working hours. [7] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Business Review Online and print journal covering topics related to business management practices Go to source If you’re not the only one bothered by noise in the office, approach your boss or HR as a group. The powers-that-be may be more likely to take action if multiple people talk to them about the problem."

      "title": "Develop a system for letting others know you need quiet.",
      "content": "Develop a system for letting others know you need quiet. A polite visual signal can help dissuade coworkers from popping in to say hello or having loud conversations right outside your door. If you have a cubicle door or screen, closing it may be enough to let others know you need peace and quiet. You could also put up a sign by your cubicle entrance that says “Please Do Not Disturb” or something similar. [8] X Research source A miniature whiteboard can be a great way to leave specific messages about your availability. For example, when you’re under a time crunch, write something like, “Trying to meet 2 PM deadline—leave a message, and I’ll get back to you!” Make sure to also let your coworkers know when you are available to chat. When you’re not busy, you could switch out your “Do Not Disturb” sign with a friendly “Come on in!”"
