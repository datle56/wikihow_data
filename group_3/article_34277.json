      "content": "Prime the pump at the beginning of each pool season. While the pool has been covered for the offseason, the water in the pump and lines may have evaporated or drained off. When you prime the pump, you add water to it and bleed off the air in the lines. [1] X Research source Prime your pump anytime your pool sits for 1-2 months."

      "content": "Turn the pump off. The pump should have an off switch somewhere on it. Flip the switch to turn it off. If it doesn't, find the cord that goes to the wall. At the wall, there should be a circuit breaker switch that you can flip to turn off the electricity to the pump. [2] X Research source That way, you're not working on an electrical item while current is flowing to it!"

      "title": "Flip the breaker to the pool system.",
      "content": "Flip the breaker to the pool system. Find your breaker box and look for the breaker that's labeled for the pool area. Flip the breaker so that the current is off running to your pool. [3] X Research source This extra precaution ensures you won't get electrocuted!"

      "title": "Take the lid off the pump.",
      "content": "Take the lid off the pump. The pump is covered with a lid to create a closed system. You will likely need to unscrew the cover to get to the pump. The cover must fit on tightly so that it doesn't allow air into the system when it's running."

      "title": "Turn the multi-port valve to \"recirculate.\"",
      "content": "Turn the multi-port valve to \"recirculate.\" The multi-port valve should be on the pipes next to your pump. If you're not sure which one it is, look in your owner's manual for your particular pump. Turn it to the place marked \"recirculate.\" [4] X Research source This allows the water to flow just into your pump and not through your filter."

    {
      "title": "Relieve air pressure in your filter by turning the air valve.",
      "content": "Relieve air pressure in your filter by turning the air valve. Find the valve on top of the pool filter. It's a little round knob. Twist it counterclockwise (anticlockwise) to open up the valve. The gauge should read 0 psi when you're done. [5] X Research source Leave this valve open."

The suction could knock the cover off as you turn the pump back on if the lid is not on tight. You need to screw the cover back into place.

The water pump may gurgle with air bubbles at first, but it should soon be running smoothly with just water. [9] X Research source You can also watch the air valve. It should leak air then start spraying a little water if the pump is running correctly. If you don't see these signs within a minute or so, turn the pump off again and repeat the steps from above."

That will close the valve and the pump system. Also, turn the valve for the water from \"recirculate\" back to \"filter.\" [10] X Research source Now, the water should be running back through the filter."

One issue that can cause your pump problems is if you're not getting a tight enough seal with the pump lid. Turn off the pump and take the lid off. Scrub the lid and the threads with dish soap and water and rinse it off thoroughly. Dry the lid and rub a lubricant into the O-ring under the lid. You can use petroleum jelly for this purpose. Put the lid back on tightly. [14] X Research source The purpose of this is to make the seal as tight as you can. Turn the pump on again and see if it works."
