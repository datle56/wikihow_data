The tens digit, the one just to the right of the hundreds digit, tells you which hundreds digit your number is closest to—that's why it's sometimes called the \"talking digit.\" [1] X Research source For example, in 478 {\\displaystyle 478} , the \"talking digit\" in the tens place is a 7 {\\displaystyle 7} . Using a number line can help you easily visualize which hundred your number is closest to."
