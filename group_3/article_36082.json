Then turn off the appliance and use your fingers, a plastic scraper , or a butter knife to peel the adhesive from the surface. Work slowly so as not to remove any paint. Turn your hair dryer back on as needed to heat up the adhesive and weaken its bond to the surface, so you can peel or scrape it off. [1] X Research source This method is safe for getting rid of the adhesive you used to hang pictures, shelving, hooks, or display objects on your painted wall. It's also safe to use on kitchen cabinets where you might attach baby locks with double-sided foam tape."

Go slowly so you don't lift any paint or splinters. [3] X Research source Isopropyl alcohol is food-safe and ideal for cleaning 3M adhesive from a cutting board, the surface or interior of an appliance, or your kitchen utensils. It's also perfect for removing 3M adhesive residue from glass, like after you take a detachable dash cam off your windshield."

Then, while working the razor blade in one direction and wiggling it back and forth, gently scrape the adhesive from the tile. The sharp blade won't harm regular, unpainted tile. [4] X Research source Don't use a razor blade on walls, wood, cars, or other types of metals. You're far more likely to scratch these surfaces than you are ceramic tile."

As the acetone soaks in, begin peeling the adhesive with your fingers or a small plastic scraper. Continue soaking cotton balls in nail polish remover and rubbing them on the adhesive until the bond is softened enough to remove it. [5] X Research source Avoid using nail polish remover on a painted or finished surface. Acetone is a strong solvent that will lift paint from walls, cars, and furniture. It's also not food-safe, so keep it away from anything you use to cook. [6] X Research source"

Let it sit for 10 minutes and then scrape up the residue with a plastic scraper. Finish up by cleaning the surface with soap and water. [9] X Research source Due to its oil content, peanut butter can also effectively remove 3M adhesive. Use the same method as above to apply it to the adhesive."

Then rub a dry microfiber cloth into the Goo Gone to lift the sticky residue. This is a strong cleaner, so wear gloves when using it and avoid cleaning items you use to cook or serve food.
