      "content": "Boiling water shrinks Crocs quickly without causing damage. Fill a large pot with water about 3/4 of the way full, then put it on high heat and wait until it boils. Place your Crocs into the water for 5 minutes, then use a pair of tongs to take them out. [1] X Research source Use your tongs to gently stir the Crocs in the water so that both shoes get even coverage. If your Crocs can’t both fit into the pot at the same time, boil them one at a time or place them on a sink with the boiling water."

      "content": "Place both of your Crocs on a flat table or countertop. Then, point the blow dryer at them and turn it on high heat. Slowly move the hair dryer back and forth over your Crocs for even coverage. [3] X Research source This is a great method to use if you need to shrink the strap on your Crocs, too. Direct the hair dryer directly at the strap to target it."

      "content": "Wait for a sunny day and place your Crocs in the direct sunlight. Check them out after about 20 minutes to see how much they’ve shrunk. Direct sunlight usually makes Crocs shrink super fast, so don't forget about them. [4] X Research source If you’re pressed for time or need your Crocs to shrink a lot, try leaving them in a hot car with the windows rolled up. Crocs shrink very quickly in a hot car, so be sure to check on them every 20 minutes or so."

      "content": "Wait for about 5 minutes to avoid hurting your feet. Once you feel like your Crocs have shrunk enough, let them cool down and then try them on. If you need to shrink them more, don’t worry—it's possible! You can: Place the Crocs in boiling water for another 5 minutes. Throw the Crocs back in the dryer for 5 minutes. Heat the Crocs with your blow dryer for another 10 minutes. Put the shoes in direct sunlight for another 20 minutes."
