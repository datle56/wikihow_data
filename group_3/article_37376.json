      "content": "Joke about your boredom to pave the way for an invitation. If you’re not busy and hoping your crush will ask you to do something or go somewhere, make it clear your schedule is wide open. Then, make a little joke to keep the conversation light and flirtatious. [1] X Research source “Not much, just keeping myself busy … lying down, looking out the window, the important stuff.” “Nothing much, kind of bored, hbu?” “Nothing right now, besides looking at my vacuum and hoping it will just clean my apartment for me” “Nothing. Might do something really fulfilling and make a PB&J soon. You?”"

      "content": "Mention the shows or music you like to see what you have in common. Keegan says that chances are, if someone asks you what you’re doing, they’re trying to start a conversation. Try telling them what you’re watching, even if you don’t have it on your screen at that exact moment. Then, ask if they’re familiar with it. If they are, you’ve got something to talk about. If not, you have something new and interesting to share with them! “Just started watching the new Marvel movie—are you a fan?” “I’m re-watching Gilmore Girls for the 800th time. It’s my comfort show.” “Listening to Chappell Roan on repeat! What music are you into right now?”"

      "content": "Show off your pets to share them with a crush and keep the chat going. Send a photo or short video of your dog, cat, lizard, or other animals (bonus points if you’re in the photo looking happy and cute, too). This is a great way to be open and friendly without directly flirting, in case you’re not sure how they feel about you (or vice versa). “Just giving Mittens some scritches. Look at how cute she is!” “Playing fetch with Roger! He goes nuts for nerf footballs.” “It’s bath time for Bella. Look at this spoiled pup 😍”"

      "content": "Bond over homework you both have if you need something to talk about. Use this if your friend or crush is in your class and you’re not sure how to keep the chat going . It gives you both an opportunity to bond by complaining or talking about something you have in common—plus, you might actually get some good help out of it! “I’m staring at my computer wondering why I signed up for AP European history 🤦” “I’m trying to find the motivation to read for class tomorrow. Have you done it yet?” “Trying to coordinate my group for this comparative politics project. How’s your group managing?” “Just finishing up tonight’s math homework, have you looked at it yet?”"

      "content": "See if they want to join you last-minute for a low-key activity. Ask if they want to grab a drink, get lunch, or even run some errands with you. Invite them to almost anything you like as long as it’s low-pressure or convenient (for example, asking them to be your plus one to a wedding at the last minute might be too much). “Hey! I’m starving and was just about to grab lunch. Wanna come?” “I was just about to buy tickets to see a movie tonight. Want me to get you one?” “Gotta run some errands downtown. Wanna come?”"

Keegan says, “If you want to flirt back a little, add a winking emoji to your response.” That might invite the person you’re texting to make the next move. Popular flirting emojis could include 😉 ( winky face ), 😘 ( blowing a kiss ), 😈 ( smiling devil ), or 🙈 (see no evil). The possibilities are endless! “Just relaxing at home 😈 how about you?” “I’m getting ready for bed 😉” “Hey there 😘 just winding down for the day. You?”"

Keep things vague and lighthearted to make them want to keep texting you and “crack the code.” Try a winky face emoji or an “lol” to make sure they know you’re being flirty or playing a little hard-to-get —otherwise, it might seem rude. “I could be doing a lot of things right now. Why do you want to know? 😉” “Maybe something, maybe nothing…who’s to say? Lol” “What do you think I’m doing? 3 guesses, go!”"

      "content": "Give your crush a little push to make a move if you know they like you. This is a bold move, so be sure about how they feel about you—maybe they’ve hinted at it before, or a mutual friend gave you the scoop. If all goes well, their next message will be an invitation to your first date. “Not much, just waiting for a text from you that says ‘Coffee?’ so I can say ‘I’d love to’ 😉” “Thinking about how great it would be if you finally asked me on a date lol” “Just wondering how much longer I have to wait before you ask me to dinner!”"

Say something about how you’re thinking up a funny, unique text to ask them out with. As an extra joke, mention you’ll let them know once you think of something. “Just trying to figure out the best way to ask you out for coffee this weekend 🤔” “I’m crafting the perfect text message to ask you to grab dinner with me tomorrow night. I’ll send it once I think of it!” “Thinking of the best ways to ask you out. I think I’ll go with this: Want to grab smoothies and go for a walk in the park later?”"

Save this for after you’ve been flirting with each other for a few days or weeks to avoid coming on too strong (it might be a bit much if you just met yesterday). Try adding a specific memory or thought about the person to make it more personal or touching. [2] X Research source “Just thinking about how fun our date was last night 😊” “Thinking about how gorgeous your smile is” “Just sitting here hoping you’d text me soon 🙂”"

Wait to use this reply until you’ve established your feelings for each other—it might be awkward if they just had a question about an assignment! Follow up with a question about when they’ll be back, or what you want to do once you’re reunited. “Just wishing you were here!” “Missing you. Are you sure you can’t cut your trip short? 😉” “Laying dramatically on the sofa, longing for your presence. I’m treating you to a nice dinner when you’re back!”"

Always test the waters or ask if your crush or partner is comfortable with these kinds of messages before getting too explicit. If they are, send something cheeky to invite them over or start a sexting session if getting together isn’t practical. “Not you, unfortunately. But that could change soon.” “Just lying alone in bed, thinking of what we could do if you were here…😈” “Just thinking about how hot you are 🤤”"

Try this when you’re not sure what the person wants or you don’t know them very well—or if you just don’t want to tell them what you’re doing. A lot of times, “What are you doing?” is just a conversation starter, Keegan says, so if they have more to say, leave it up to them to share it. “Hey! Nothing in particular.” “Not a lot, just getting ready for the day.” “Nothing much, just typical Monday stuff.”"

Answer with a neutral phrase like “Not much” or “Not a whole lot,” then thank them and ask how they are in return. Also try this for people you know, but you’re not sure what your relationship with them is (like if you’re unsure whether they have a crush on you or are mad at you, for example). [3] X Research source “Hi there, I’m not up to much. Thanks for asking! How are you?” “Oh not too much, thanks. You?” “Nothing much! How about you?” “It’s been busy but I’m finally catching up on texts. What’s up?”"

      "content": "Be real if you’re not living your best life and want to talk about it. Be prepared for a heavier or surprised response since most people expect a neutral or positive reply to “What are you doing?” If you don’t know the person well enough to be open and honest, a generic “Not much!” is more appropriate. “Ugh I’m lying in bed with the worst head cold ever today.” “It’s been a really hard week and I’m exhausted.” “I’m running late to work. The bus is so unreliable these days!” “Lol I’m bandaging up my finger. Turns out knives are really slippery when you’re washing them!”"

If you’re trying to shut down the conversation or aren’t interested in the person texting you, keep it short and sweet to get your point across. “I’m just about to start an important Zoom call. I’ll text you when I’m out!” “I’m really busy right now, sorry.” “Hey, I can’t talk. Long day today.”"
