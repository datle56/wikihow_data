      "content": "Remove or raise your clothing. Ideally, you’ll want to measure your waist against your bare skin, since bulky tops or undergarments might make your measurement inaccurate. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Find your true waist.",
      "content": "Find your true waist. Your true waist is between your rib cage and your hip. If you look in the mirror, it should be the part of your torso that thins slightly, generally right above your belly button. [2] X Research source If you’re still having trouble finding your waist, slightly bend your body to one side. The crease that forms where you bend is your natural waistline."

      "title": "Wrap a piece of string around your waist.",
      "content": "Wrap a piece of string around your waist. Once you have found your true waist, take a piece of string and wrap it around your body. Hold it straight and parallel to the floor, and make sure the string is snug but not too tight. [3] X Research source You can also use dental floss or yarn if you don’t have any string. Don’t suck in your stomach, since that won’t be your true waist measurement."
    },
    {
      "title": "Exhale, then note the length of the string.",
      "content": "Exhale, then note the length of the string. You can either mark the length with your finger or cut the string. However, make sure you take a measurement as you’re exhaling, not inhale, since your stomach expands slightly as you exhale. [4] X Research source If you don’t have a pair of scissors, you can use a dark permanent to mark the spot where the two ends of the string touch."

    {
      "title": "Use a yardstick or ruler to measure the string, if you have one.",
      "content": "Use a yardstick or ruler to measure the string, if you have one. Lay your string out flat, then use a ruler or yardstick to measure its length. If you’re using a ruler, you may have to use it more than once – simply keep track of where it ended with your finger, remove the ruler, then start over from that spot. [5] X Research source Make sure the string is completely straight when you line it up next to the ruler. If it's not, your measurement will be slightly smaller than your waist really is."

      "content": "Wrap dollar bills around your waist and multiply by 6.14 inches (15.6 cm). All U.S. dollar bills measure 6.14 inches (15.6 cm) long and 2.61 inches (6.6 cm) tall. You can tape a few dollar bills together, then wrap them around your waist. Multiply the number of dollar bills you needed by 6.14 inches (15.6 cm) to get an approximation of your waist measurement! [6] X Research source For example, if you used 4 dollar bills around your waist, multiply that by 6.14. You’ll get 24.36 inches (61.9 cm) for your waist circumference. If you’re taping the dollar bills around your waist and the last one is overlapping the first dollar, you may need to fold it in half or in thirds. As a reference, a dollar bill is 3.125 inches (7.94 cm) folded in half, and 1.25 inches (3.2 cm) folded in thirds. [7] X Research source"

      "title": "Find your waist circumference using printer paper.",
      "content": "Find your waist circumference using printer paper. Printer paper measures exactly 8.5 by 11 inches (22 by 28 cm). Tape the edges of the paper together to form a circle around your waist, then measure the number of papers you used by either 8.5 inches (22 cm) if you used the short side or 11 inches (28 cm) if you used the long side to get your approximate waist measurement. [8] X Research source Make sure you’re using standard printer paper. If you’re using the above measurements and the paper is too long or thin, your waist measurement will come out inaccurate. If you get around your waist and the last piece of paper is too long, fold it in half or in thirds lengthwise to finish the measurement. Printer paper divided in half is 4.25 inches (10.8 cm) and 2.83 inches (7.2 cm) divided into thirds. Add this number to your final calculation to get your waist measurement."

      "title": "Use your hand to approximate your waist circumference.",
      "content": "Use your hand to approximate your waist circumference. An outstretched hand, measured from the tip of the thumb to the tip of the pinky, is about 9 inches (23 cm) long. Additionally, the first joint on your index finger (from your top knuckle to the end of your fingertip) is about 1 inch (2.5 cm) long. Use the knowledge of these hand measurements to find the circumference of your waist. [9] X Research source If you used a piece of string to measure your waist and don’t have a ruler, you can use your hand measurements to measure the string. All you’ll need to do is mark increments on it while you move your hand down the length of the string. Keep in mind that these measurements are not exact, and can vary if you are particularly tall or short. You may need to check the measurements on your hands first before finding your waist circumference."
