      "content": "Pick latex, acrylic, or epoxy paint for ceramic tile or large pieces of pottery. For projects like painting a tile wall or a ceramic vase, use a liquid paint that you can apply by hand. Opt for epoxy paint to get a glossy, highly durable and long-lasting finish. Alternatively, acrylic and latex paint aren’t as durable for high-traffic areas as epoxy, but are easier to find and work with.

      "content": "Clean the ceramic thoroughly with water and cleaner. For ceramic tile, thoroughly scrub the area you plan to repaint with an abrasive cleaner, and wipe it down until it's clean and dry. For pieces of pottery and dishes, simply wipe down the surface of the item with a wet rag until it’s clean of dirt and debris. [3] X Research source Alternatively, you can also use a clean sponge to gently scrub off any caked-on dirt or stains."

      "title": "Sand the surface of the ceramic to remove any glossy coating.",
      "content": "Sand the surface of the ceramic to remove any glossy coating. For dishes and pottery, sand lightly by hand with a piece of steel wool. For ceramic tile, affix 180 or 220-grit sandpaper to an orbital sander and sand your tiles down carefully. Be sure to wipe up any dust with a wet rag after sanding. [4] X Research source The sandpaper creates microabrasions in the glaze of the dish or tile, allowing paint to stick more easily. You should also sand the ceramic if the surface is uneven, since that could affect the finish of the paint. [5] X Expert Source Natasha Dikareva, MFA Ceramics & Sculpting Instructor Expert Interview. 1 June 2021. Your goal is to remove any extra gloss remaining above the ceramic itself, without damaging the ceramic."

      "content": "Apply 2 light coats of primer to the ceramic. Use a spray or oil-based liquid bonding primer for the tile, and coat it with light, even layers. Let each layer dry in between painting coats to ensure that the paint will stick. If the primer looks gritty after 2 or 3 coats, lightly sand the surface with a piece of steel wool. Let the primer dry for 12-24 hours before continuing with the project. [6] X Research source [7] X Research source"

Move the brush or roller in diagonal lines in small sections to coat the ceramic. Once one section is coated, move to the area to paint diagonally until the surface of the ceramic is covered.

      "content": "Sand the ceramic lightly after the first coat is dry. Once the paint is dry, use a 220-grit sandpaper to lightly sand the paint. Hold the sandpaper in your hand, and focus on areas where you have ridges or drips from the paint. If you’re sanding a piece of pottery or a dish, opt for a piece of steel wool instead.
