Set the temperature of your room appropriately, not too warm or too cold. Typically this will be between 65 and 72 degrees Fahrenheit, but you should adjust the temperature so that you feel comfortable. Setting the temperature just slightly cooler than comfortable -- so that you're fine, but still need covers -- will help you sleep.

      "content": "Keep a fan running. In addition to providing extra airflow and controlling room temperature, a fan produces a low, consistent level of background noise. This can help eliminate auditory stimuli that keep you from falling and staying asleep. Keep in mind that for some, a fan might not be helpful. If it doesn’t work for you, then don’t use one."

This applies even to small lights, like those on your T.V., a digital clock or D.V.D. player. The absence of light eliminates the presence stimuli that can alter or affect your sleeping patterns. If there is some reason you cannot, or do not wish to, install blinds or curtains, you can invest in a sleep mask to help simulate darkness."

[3] X Expert Source Alex Dimitriu, MD Sleep Medicine & Psychiatry Professional Expert Interview. 16 October 2019. In the event that it is not possible to get to bed at your usual time, it is important to still get up at the normal time. You may feel a bit more tired, but you will mess up your routine even more if you sleep in. If you are very tired, you can take a power nap during the day.

To give your brain some wind-down time, listen to soothing music or read a book for about 10 minutes before going to bed. Try to keep this wind-down period to about 10 minutes, as any longer may risk further sensory stimulation and cut into your sleeping time. Avoid reading on back-lit screens, though, as these tend to disrupt your sleep patterns. [5] X Research source Don't try to have deep conversations right before bed, either. If you have a problem with your spouse, for example, don't wait until just before bedtime to bring it up. Resolve your concerns earlier in the day so they don't plague you at night."

Maybe you need to wake up earlier to make breakfast or a bag lunch for the day or you need the extra time to clean up and groom yourself. One way to sleep longer is to handle these types of issues in the evening before you go to sleep. Make your bag lunch and put it in the fridge. If you need coffee in the morning, set your pot to turn on automatically. If you need to bathe, do it before you go to bed.

      "content": "Choose a non-habit forming aid. For years, sleep aids were considered a dangerous solution to sleep pattern problems because the user would form a dependency, needing the sleep aid to sleep each night, regardless of the surrounding circumstances. However, recent advances in sleep aid medicine have yielded non-habit forming pills that can help you get to sleep faster and stay asleep for longer. Common over-the-counter sleep aids rely on the following active ingredients: Diphenhydramine, which is found in brands such as Benadryl and Unisom SleepGels, is an antihistamine with sedative effects. The side effects of diphenhydramine are dry mouth, drowsiness, blurred vision, urinary retention and constipation. Doxylamine succinate (found in Unisom SleepTabs) also contains a sedating antihistamine. Doxylamine succinate and diphenhydramine have similar side effects. Melatonin is a hormone that helps to regulate your natural sleep-wake cycle. Melatonin supplements have been shown to be potentially helpful in treating jet lag. It also has been shown to help people fall asleep quicker. Potential side effects to look for are headaches and daytime sleepiness. Valerian supplements have been used as sleep aids in some circumstances. While some research has shown potential therapeutic benefits, other studies have suggested it is ineffective as a sleep aid. Valerian does not seem to cause any side effects in users. [17] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Most over-the-counter sleep aids rely on the sedative effects of antihistamines to help users go to sleep. However, people can quickly build a tolerance to antihistamines, making this type of sleep aid a temporary solution at best.

These work much the same as over-the-counter melatonin and help alter your circadian rhythms. Orexin receptor antagonists. These block orexin, a brain chemical that may cause sleep difficulties. Some of these medications may not be safely used by pregnant people. Talk with your doctor about any medical conditions you have before taking any prescription medications."
