      "content": "Start your car and turn on your defrost setting. Fire up your car’s engine so it can start heating up. Turn on the heater and set it to the defrost setting so the warm air flows over your windshield to start warming it up and melting the ice. [1] X Research source It may take a few minutes for the air coming out to warm up. If your car has defrost vents on your side windows and side mirrors, turn them on as well."

      "content": "Set the temperature to full heat and the air to recirculate. Find your temperature button or slide and set it to the highest heat setting possible. Look for an airflow setting on your A/C panel and adjust it so the air inside the car is being recirculated. [2] X Research source Recirculating the air can help it heat up faster and warms up the air inside the car which can help defrost any other windows with ice on them."

      "title": "Turn on your headlights to melt any ice on them.",
      "content": "Turn on your headlights to melt any ice on them. Flick on your car’s headlights and taillights so the bulbs can start warming up, which will melt the ice and make it easier to remove. Leave the lights on while you remove the ice from your windows to give it some time to heat up. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Use a plastic scraper to scrape off the ice from your windows.",
      "content": "Use a plastic scraper to scrape off the ice from your windows. Take a plastic glass scraper and wedge it beneath the layer of ice on the outside of the glass. Drag the scraper over the surface of the glass to scrape off the ice. Work your way around your car and remove the ice from all of your windows so you’re able to see in every direction when you drive. [4] X Research source Avoid using anything but a scraper designed to remove ice from cars so you don’t scratch the glass. If there’s ice covering your headlights, scrape it off as well."

      "title": "Spray a rubbing alcohol and water mixture on stubborn ice.",
      "content": "Spray a rubbing alcohol and water mixture on stubborn ice. If the ice is too thick or difficult to scrape off with just your scraper, take a clean spray bottle and add 1 part rubbing alcohol and 2 parts water. Shake it up well to fully combine the mixture. Apply the solution liberally over your windshield and windows to start melting the ice and make it easier to scrape off. [5] X Research source If you plan to keep a spray bottle full of the mixture, keep it stored in your home so it stays at room temperature. If you store it in your car it could freeze. You can also add a few drops of dish soap to the mixture to act as a surfactant, which can help the solution coat the ice more evenly."

      "content": "Brush off any snow on your car with a broom or show brush. Snow likes to settle on the roof, hood, and trunk of your car and could become a hazard out on the road, so take a sturdy show brush or a broom and give your car a good sweeping. Knock off snow you find stuck on top of any ice on your car as well to make the ice easier to scrape off. [6] X Research source Whatever you do, don’t use a snow shovel to brush the snow off of your car. It’s way too easy to scratch up your paint job or crack a window."

      "content": "Smack your hood and trunk with a flattened hand. Break up any thin layers of ice that may have formed over the surface of your car so they’re easier to brush off. A good, open-handed smack on the hood as well as your trunk should do the trick. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Use lock de-icer if your car’s locks are frozen. If you can’t unlock your car because a layer of ice has them frozen, apply a commercial lock de-icer to get them working again. Spray the liquid into the keyhole and wait for it to melt the ice. Then, unlock your car door. [8] X Research source Lock for lock de-icer at your local auto supply store or department store. You can also order it online. You can also make your own de-icer by mixing together 1 cup (240 mL) of rubbing alcohol and 1 cup (240 mL) of water in a spray bottle. Spray the mixture onto your keyholes to melt the ice."

      "title": "Make sure all of the ice and snow is removed before you drive.",
      "content": "Make sure all of the ice and snow is removed before you drive. Walk around your car and inspect it for any ice or snow that may still be on it. If you find any, scrape or brush it off. Any ice or snow that you leave on could come loose and fly off while you’re driving, which could potentially cause an accident. [9] X Research source It can be tempting to try to get just enough ice off so you can see, especially if you’re late or in a hurry. But it could be really dangerous. Take an extra moment to remove all of the ice before you drive. In many places driving with snow and ice still on your car is also illegal and you could be faced with a hefty fine."

      "content": "Park your car in a garage if you can. If you have a covered garage, use it! Park your car there so it isn’t exposed to the elements and forms ice on the windshield and windows overnight. [10] X Research source Parking under a covered carport can also help prevent snow and ice from building up on your car."

      "content": "Spray a mixture of vinegar and water on your windshield at night. Combine 3 parts white vinegar with 1 part water in a spray bottle and shake it up to mix it well. Pretreat your windshield with the solution and then wipe up the excess to leave a thin layer on the glass that will help keep ice from forming overnight. [11] X Research source Don’t leave too much liquid on the glass or it could potentially freeze if it gets cold enough. FYI: according to AAA, some glass professionals believe that exposing your windshield to liquid vinegar too often could damage the glass."

      "title": "Cover your windshield at night as an alternative.",
      "content": "Cover your windshield at night as an alternative. Another option you can use if you want to keep ice from forming on your windshield overnight is to cover it with a windshield cover, tarp, towel, a folded sheet, or even bath mats. Cover the glass so none of it is exposed to prevent ice from being able to form on it. [12] X Research source You can find windshield covers that use magnets to stay attached to your windshield at your local auto supply shop. You can also order them online. You may have heard that soaking windshield covers in salt water can help prevent ice. While they can stop ice from forming, they can also damage your car’s wax and finish. You may just want to use a dry cover."
