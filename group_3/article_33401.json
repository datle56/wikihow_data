      "title": "Find a large, open area where you can play.",
      "content": "Find a large, open area where you can play. You don’t need a top-secret room in a top-secret facility on a top-secret private island to play squid game with your pals—but you do need a good chunk of space to get the most out of this activity. Squid game is often played on big, sandy fields, but you can realistically play it in any wide, open, indoor or outdoor space. [1] X Research source There aren’t any official dimensions or size recommendations out there for a squid game court. However, based on what we see in Squid Game , the squid-shaped play area looks to be about half the size of a traditional basketball court."

    {
      "title": "Mark out the large, house-shaped body of the squid (section D).",
      "content": "Mark out the large, house-shaped body of the squid (section D). A squid game court roughly looks like its namesake, with a wide “body” and tapered “head.” Start by outlining the triangular tip of the squid’s “head,” along with the square base of its body. This large, house-shaped “body” is also known as section D. [2] X Research source There isn’t an “official” way to draw out your squid game court. Just do whatever makes the most sense for your personal set-up, whether that’s drawing directly in the dirt, using spray paint, or taping out the parameters indoors."

    {
      "title": "Outline a small circle overlapping with the squid’s head (sections A and C).",
      "content": "Outline a small circle overlapping with the squid’s head (sections A and C). The large, rounded part is section A, while the triangular tip inside of the circle is section C. Try to make the circle big enough to fit multiple people, especially if you plan to play with a lot of friends. [3] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Draw another large circle at the base of the squid (section B).",
      "content": "Draw another large circle at the base of the squid (section B). Stand on the horizontal line along the bottom of your squid. At the very middle of this line, mark out a circle that’s large enough for multiple players to stand in. About half of this circle should overlap with section D, while the other half should stick outside of the court. [4] X Research source Section B should be the same size as section A."
    },
    {
      "title": "Sketch out 2 rectangles along the center of the squid (section F).",
      "content": "Sketch out 2 rectangles along the center of the squid (section F). Stand toward the middle of the squid’s body, where the 2 straight lines connect with the 2 angled lines. Mark out 2 long, horizontal rectangles at both of these points, leaving a short, 1 ft (30 cm) gap between them at the center of the court. [5] X Research source These rectangles almost look like “eyes” on the squid."

    {
      "title": "Attach a circle to the outer edge of each triangle (section E).",
      "content": "Attach a circle to the outer edge of each triangle (section E). Find the point on each side of the squid where the angled and straight lines connect—this should be around the end of each rectangle. Draw small, identical circles along each meeting point. [6] X Research source These circles should only be large enough to fit 1 player."

      "title": "Divide into 2 even teams:",
      "content": "Divide into 2 even teams: offense and defense. [7] X Research source There aren’t any “official” ways to choose sides, though you could always take a page out of Gi-hun and Sang-woo’s book by deciding with a simple coin toss. There’s no official dress code for this game, but it might help to have each team wear jerseys or matching colors so there isn’t any confusion. [8] X Research source If you really watch to capture the spirit of Squid Game ’s finale, you could always don a nice suit and jacket—but with all the rough-and-tumble gameplay, we don’t recommend this!"

The offensive team wins once any offensive player jumps with both feet into section C.

      "content": "Enter the squid court through section B and avoid crossing forbidden lines. Think of section B as the front door or entry gate to the squid game court. This is the case for both offense and defense; all players must enter the play area through this opening—if you cross any other lines, you’ll be kicked out of the game. [12] X Research source The only exception to this rule is the bridge, which you can enter through section E."

Instead, you have to hop out of section A and go to the opposite end of the court, where you can enter through section B. [14] X Research source Don’t be surprised if a lot of your game actually takes place outside the court! No one goes first and you don't take turns in this game. Someone calls out to start the game, and everything happens simultaneously after that! It's a little chaotic—which is part of the fun!"

Feel free to move around on both feet while you’re in sections A, B, and E—these are considered safe zones.

Outside of the court, defensive players have to hop on 1 foot just like the offensive players. [21] X Research source Defensive players must stand on 1 foot when they’re on the bridge (section F) unless they’re standing in the small, central gap that’s part of section D.

Do whatever you can to knock offensive players to the ground or force them over a forbidden line. The defensive team wins as soon as you eliminate every offensive player. [23] X Research source You can always try knocking the offensive players off-balance, too! If they put 2 feet on the ground before successfully crossing the bridge, they’ll be kicked out of the game."
