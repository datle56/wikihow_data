Check the guidelines for the specific test you're prepping for and follow those. For example, for the SAT, you'll have 65 minutes to answer 52 multiple-choice questions. If you find yourself struggling to finish, try skimming the passages so that you can get done sooner. [3] X Research source Practice doesn't make perfect, but it does make you better.

Many private companies offer intensive courses that help you prepare for standardized tests, including the reading comprehension portion. They can be pricey, but if you have the funds available, they can also be really helpful. Search online to see if there are test prep courses in your area and contact them with questions.

But if you're concerned that you won't have time to read the entire passage, definitely practice your skimming skills. When you skim, read the first line and the last line of each paragraph carefully. Let your eyes go quickly over the other sentences. This will ensure that you get the main points, but don't spend too much time focusing on the details.

Next, cross out the answer that is probably wrong. You'll be left with the answer that is most likely right. That might sound overly simple, but that's really because multiple-choice tests are largely about practicing and strategy. You've got this! [14] X Research source A sample question might be: \"In the passage, Nick expressed his jealousy of Gatsby. Was he jealous because Gatsby: A: Was divorced B: Was ill C: Was wealthy D: Fought in the war You can go ahead and cross out A and B because it's pretty likely that no one is jealous of someone for being sick or divorced. While it is possible that Nick would be jealous if Gatsby was a war hero, there are plenty of context clues in the passage that talk about money. You can confidently choose C."

That’s way too stressful! Instead, just refer back to the reading as you write your answer. That way you can make sure to get your facts straight. Try looking for keywords that seem significant. You can also look for a theme that is emphasized more than once. That's a good indicator that it is important! [16] X Research source If you’re trying to add some specific examples to your answer, the text is the best place to find them.
