      "content": "Get the resolution you need. High Definition (HD) has been the standard for most televisions for the past decade. This is a resolution of 1920 x 1080 pixels. The standard for most newer TVs is 4K Ultra High Definition (UHD) with a resolution of 3840 x 2160 pixels. 8K TVs are just around the corner. But how much resolution do you need? While 4K provides four times the resolution of standard HD, the human eye can only see so much detail. Most people have to look very closely to see the difference between 4K and standard HD. Don't get too hung up on the screen resolution of your TV. Standard HD is adequate for most games. 4K is just icing on the cake. The only game consoles on the market that support 4K gaming are PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, PlayStation 4 Pro, and Xbox One X."

      "content": "Check that the TV has at least a 60 Hz refresh rate or higher. The refresh rate of your TV determines how many frames-per-second (FPS) your TV can display. A higher refresh rate provides smoother motion and less input lag. Many gamers prefer higher refresh rates over higher resolution. 30 frames-per-second can provide an adequate cinematic quality experience. 60 frames-per-second provides a much smoother experience for gaming. The PlayStation 4 and Xbox One support up to 60 frames-per-second or 60 Hz. The PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X can support up to 120 frames-per-second or 120 Hz. You'll need a TV with a 120 Hz refresh rate to get 120 frames-per-second on your TV. Be aware of deceptive refresh rate claims when purchasing a TV. Many TVs (especially budget TVs) claim to have an \"effective refresh rate\" or \"motion rate\" or 120 or 240 frames-per-second, but don't actually support true 120 or 240 Hz refresh rates. These televisions may insert blank frames or use processing tricks to create artificial frames in a 60 Hz refresh rate. While these tricks may create improved motion, they are not a true 120 or 240 refresh rate. [1] X Research source"

Most modern TVs support HDMI, but not all TVs support HDMI 2.1. While you don't need HDMI 2.1 to game on your TV, you do need it to enjoy 4K resolution beyond 60 frame-per-second"

      "content": "Make sure your TV supports HDR (optional). HDR stands for High Dynamic Range. This provides enhanced color on your TV. It allows for more contrast between the light and dark colors displayed on-screen. Using HDR is up to you. It may result in better-looking images, but it may also create more input lag during your gaming experience. This isn't too much of a problem with newer TVs, but some older TVs may experience lag when HDR is enabled. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Check the screen-lighting technique for the TV.",
      "content": "Check the screen-lighting technique for the TV. All TVs require a light source to display an image on the screen. The way they light the screen can greatly affect your image quality. The following are some common screen-lighting techniques: [3] X Research source Edge-lit: This is one of the most common screen-lighting techniques. This uses a string of LED lights placed on 1 or more edges of the TV. This allows for ultra-thin TVs. The downside to this technique is that they can only dim large sections of the screen at a time. Direct-lit: This technique uses a LED lights placed behind the screen to illuminate the screen. These LEDs cannot be dimmed. Therefore, they cannot display the same rich dark tones that other TVs can display. Direct-lit TVs also tend to be thicker than edge-lit TVs. Full-Array: Full-array is similar to direct-lit displays, except these LEDs can be dimmed. This allows the TV to dim different areas of the screen to produce more dark rich tones. The more dimming zones a full-array TV has, the more control the TV has over the different areas of the screen that can dim and light up. OLED: OLED TVs are generally high-end TVs that produce the best quality image available. These TVs don't require any backlighting. Instead, each pixel is lit using an organic light-emitting diode, allowing each pixel to act as it's own light source. This allows for the widest color display and highest contrast between light and dark colors across the entire screen. QLED: QLED is a technology found in Samsung TVs. It is similar to OLED, except QLED displays are back-lit using nano-particles that emit light. These TVs are similar to full-array TVs, but with nearly every pixel acting as a dimming zone. Still, the contrast between lights and darks may not be as good as OLED TVs. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Don't neglect your sound system. Most modern game consoles support surround sound. The PlayStation 5 in particular features a new 3D audio engine called Tempest, which creates spatial audio that makes you feel like you are in the middle of the action. To enjoy this, you will need a decent surround sound system or a decent headset that supports surround sound."

      "content": "Use an HDMI 2.1 cable. If you want to get the highest resolution and the highest framerate, you'll need to use an HDMI 2.1 cable to transfer the bandwidth needed. An HDMI 1.4 cable can support 4K at 30 frames-per-second. An HDMI 2.0 cable can support 4K at 60 frames-per-second at 60 frames-per-second. You'll need an HDMI 2.1 if you want to go beyond 60 frames-per-second at 4K. Be aware that many HDMI cables say they're HDMI 2.1 when they're not. True HDMI 2.1 cables are usually pretty thick. If it's not very thick, it's probably not an HDMI 2.1 cable."

If you are using a game console, set your TV to \"Game mode\". If you are using a PC, set your TV to \"PC mode.\" If the TV uses 'labeling' for video inputs, this may need to be changed before Game Mode becomes available.
