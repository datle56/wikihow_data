      "content": "Wash your hair regularly and gently. Clean your hair and scalp regularly and in a gentle manner with shampoo and conditioner. This can help you not only regrow your hair, but prevent damage that may cause further hair loss. Wash your hair every other day or as little as necessary. Frequent washing can damage your strands. Massage shampoo into your scalp and into the length of your hair. Rinse by allowing water to flow from your scalp down the ends of your hair. Don’t rub your hair as it rinses, which may cause damage or hair loss."

      "content": "Dry your hair cautiously. Drying your hair with towels and hair dryers can cause damage and impede hair growth. Dry your hair with caution to help prevent breakage and promote regrowth. After you’ve washed your hair, use a towel to rub or pat your strands dry.

      "title": "Avoid vigorous or frequent brushing and combing.",
      "content": "Avoid vigorous or frequent brushing and combing. If you brush or comb your hair, try and do this as infrequently and gently as possible. Reducing how often you brush or comb and changing the way in which you do it can help promote hair growth and prevent damage. Only brush your hair to style it. It’s a myth that you should brush your hair 100 strokes a day. Allow your hair to air dry a bit before brushing or combing after washing. Use a wide toothed comb to untangle wet hair. This will cause less damage than a brush. If your hair is tangled , remove tangles gently and use a conditioner to help you if necessary."

      "title": "Style hair wisely.",
      "content": "Style hair wisely. Many people style their hair or use styling products such as curling irons, which are often hotter than a dryer. If you have to style your hair, choose loose styles, avoid heavy products, and use lower heat tools. Pulling hair back tightly in ponytails or styles such as cornrows not only can break or damage hair, but also may cause hair loss. Wear your hair pulled back loosely and try different hairstyles every day to allow your hair and scalp to relax. Use covered elastic bands to pull back your hair. Rubber can pull and break hair. Avoid styling products that are labeled “long lasting hold”. These can damage hair and cause breakage. If you use styling tools such as curling irons, flat irons, or hot combs, keep them at the lowest setting. If you wear a weave or hair extensions, make sure they are light so that they don’t pull at your hair and scalp."

If you are having multiple services, wait two weeks in between them."
