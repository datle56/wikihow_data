While all the icons are available directly on the bar for Windows 10, the newer versions of Windows 11 have the types of snips hidden inside the drop-down menu, which is the third icon. Set them up first to make sure you're capturing what you want. The third button on the control bar represents a different type of screenshot. Hover your mouse over each icon to see which type of screenshot each represents. Here's a little cheat sheet for the icons: Rectangular Snip , the first icon in the drop-down, lets you click and drag a box around the part of the screen you want to capture. When you finish drawing your box, a screenshot of the selected area will appear as a preview. Window Snip , the second icon in the drop-down, lets you capture the contents of a single open window. After clicking this option, click a window to snap a screenshot and display a preview. Fullscreen Snip , the third icon in the drop-down, takes a full screenshot of the entire desktop and displays a preview. Freeform Snip , the fourth icon in the drop-down, lets you draw any shape (freehand) around the part of the screen you want to capture. When you finish drawing your shape, a screenshot of the selected area will appear as a preview. You can also toggle between the camera and recorder icons to switch between taking a screenshot and recording your screen. Delay Snip , or the fourth icon on the menu, looks like a timer and lets you choose if you want a countdown before the screenshot."
