      "content": "Scrub lightly with soap and water to remove big chunks of paint. Simply wash off as much as you can, working lightly. Don't worry if some of it doesn't come off at first -- this is just to help you use less oil later on. Always start with soap and water -- many water and latex paints will come completely free with simple hand washing. [1] X Research source The earlier you can get to the paint, the better. Once it has dried it will be a little trickier to remove."

      "title": "Cover the painted area in a light layer of mineral or baby oil.",
      "content": "Cover the painted area in a light layer of mineral or baby oil. Mineral oil is the best cleaner since it works effectively on both oil, water, and latex-based paints. Pour just enough on your skin to cover the entire painted area. Lightly rub it on, then leave it for 2-3 minutes to soak in. [2] X Research source Any vegetable oil will work here, in a pinch, including coconut, flax seed, olive, etc."

      "content": "Scrub in small circles to lift the paint off your skin. Using your fingertips, rub the baby oil into the painted part of your skin, and gently scratch off as much of the paint as you can. You can just use your hands, working in small circles to massage the oil into the paint and remove it."

      "content": "Use cotton balls to dipped in oil to get tricky areas. If you have an old washcloth, you could use this as well, though it may get stained. You just want something a little rougher to scrub your skin. Scrub lightly in circles to remove tricky bits of paint."

      "title": "Try rubbing alcohol or nail polish remover if you're still struggling.",
      "content": "Try rubbing alcohol or nail polish remover if you're still struggling. Saturate the cotton ball with rubbing alcohol and use it to get at any stains that don't respond well to the mineral oil. Some people have had success with make-up remover as well.

      "content": "Rinse off your hands with soap and water. Once you've got everything off, use soap and water to remove the oil and smell of alcohol. If you still can't get the paint off, you're likely using a stronger oil-based paint. You can attack it directly using other oils and cleansers."

      "title": "Wash the area with warm water and liquid soap.",
      "content": "Wash the area with warm water and liquid soap. Create a thick lather on the skin, then rinse the lather away. This will remove some of the paint from your skin and make it easier for the oil to get in and lift the paint away."

      "content": "Use a cooking or essential oil to pull away the paint. Simply coat the affected area in the oil and let it sit before scrubbing. You can use a variety of oils as they all have the same cleaning properties. More likely than not, you'll want to use what you have around the house, including: Vegetable Coconut Olive Essential oils, such as lavender or rosemary"

      "content": "Rub the skin with oil and water until the primer comes off. Use a washcloth or your hands to rub the skin with oil. Rinse the skin to see if all the paint is removed, then add more oil if the skin is still stained."

      "content": "Make a salt scrub for an exfoliating, more powerful cleaner. Mix equal parts salt and oil, then scrub the mixture onto the paint to remove it. Any oil will do. However, it is best to use the biggest grain of salt you can get, usually \"coarse\" or kosher salt will do, since that provides a better scrub. [5] X Research source"
