      "content": "Make niyyah (intention) to perform wudu , and say \"Bismillah\" (in the name of Allah) before starting wudu . Niyyah is the Islamic concept of performing an act for the sake of Allah. To truly perform wudu , you should center yourself and quiet your thoughts, focusing seriously on what you are doing (intending to perform wudu (ablution)). Niyyah is not said out loud and should be made in the heart; focusing on the phrase \"Bismillah\" (in the name of Allah) is a good way to accomplish the necessary centering. Say it out loud or silently to yourself, whichever makes you comfortable."

      "content": "Inhale water into your nose. Use your right hand to cup water and inhale it into your nose and blow out three times. Snort sharply and abruptly without taking too much water into your nose and choking yourself. If you cannot inhale water into your nose, you can wet your fingers and put water on the lower part of your nostrils. Make sure to use safe water to perform this ritual; in some warmer areas of the world, water may contain naegleria fowleri , an amoeba that, if inhaled into the nostrils, can cause a rare but usually fatal type of brain infection. Even tap water (usually in third world and developing countries) may be contaminated; to avoid this illness, boil water for one minute (three minutes at higher elevations) and leave it to cool before rinsing your nose with the water."
