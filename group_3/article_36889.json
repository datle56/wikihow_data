[2] X Research source This is best utilized when you have enchantments or improvements on your tools that you don't want to lose. You'll need either 2 of the same tool or netherite ingots. Since netherite ingots are a challenge to get , the best time to do this is right before your tool breaks. You can use a pristine and undamaged item to repair your almost broken tool or you can use 4 ingots."
