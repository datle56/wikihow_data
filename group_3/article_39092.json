      "content": "Cut off a section of thread that’s twice as long as your forearm. Grab some thread that’s a pretty close color match to your hair extension. Hold the thread next to your forearm and pull out a long section. Keep pulling on the thread until it’s twice as long as your lower arm. [1] X Research source For instance, if you’re working with a blonde hair extension, you’d want to use tan thread instead of black. It’s always better to have more thread than not enough."

      "content": "Slip your thread through the hole in the needle and make a knot at the end. Loop the thread through the eye of the needle, then pull it through. Pull on both ends of the thread so they’re about the same length. To secure your thread in place, knot both ends together. [2] X Research source Essentially, you’ll have a large loop tied to your needle. You can use a regular sewing needle for this, or you can use a curved needle designed for hair extensions and wigs. Curved weaving needles make it easier to thread the wefts, but they don’t always fit through the openings on the wig clips. Sewing needles are a bit more versatile, and are a little more common.

      "content": "Pull the needle through the looped thread to create a knot on the weft. Find the left or right edge of your extension and thread your needle through the top of the weft. Pull the needle through the looped thread to create a knot, then tug the thread tight. [4] X Research source The weft is the top section of the extension where the hair is sewn in place. This helps better secure your wig clip to the extension."

      "content": "Place your wig clip face-up along the edge of the weft. Check that the rounded portion of the clip is facing upwards so you can attach the extension easily to your natural hair. If your clip is facing the wrong way and forming a “U” shape, you won’t be able to attach your hair extension properly. [5] X Research source Wig clips look like a small, curved wide-toothed comb. They’re made of metal and usually have several openings along the top, which help you sew the clip to your hair extension. It’s best to use wig clips for this, since these are designed to be sewn onto wefts."

Loop the thread through the first wig clip hole, then guide the thread through the loop that’s attached to your needle. Tighten the thread to form a knot along the wig clip, which helps hold it in place. Create 2 more knots just like this one to attach the clip securely to the hair extension. [6] X Research source For extra support, you can wrap the thread around your needle 3 times to create an extra secure knot. [7] X Research source"

Position the needle beneath the second hole or opening along the top of the wig clip. [8] X Research source This provides extra support to your hair extension and clip before you start knotting the thread again. If your wig clip doesn’t have many holes along the top, position your thread about 5 to 10 mm (0.20 to 0.39 in) from the corner opening. [9] X Research source"

Repeat this process 2 more times, looping the needle through the weft and clip, then forming a knot with the thread.

Once you’ve done this, loop your thread through the next wig clip hole and form a knot. Create 3 total knots to secure your wig clip in place. [11] X Research source Some wig clips may have more openings than others. If your clip doesn’t have any holes going across, sew and knot your thread beneath the top portion of the wig clip.
