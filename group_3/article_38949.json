Your AVID teacher will request to see your binder frequently to make sure it has everything in it and is properly organized and neat. Some AVID teachers will hand out a checklist for you to use."

      "content": "Add in your pencil pouch. Your pencil pouch should be in the way front of your binder (unless your AVID teacher says otherwise). Remember to catalog your supplies every week or so to make sure you have everything you may need. Another idea is keep any extra supplies (such as pencils, pens, crayons, markers, etc.) in you locker. That way, if you are at school and realize you don’t have any pencils in your pencil pouch, you can simply grab a few and not have to worry about not having anything to write with. It’s also good to have a few extra in case another student forgot their pen or pencil."

AVID agreements are important, so, be careful with them and read through them every so often so you don't forget them. It’s also a good idea to keep your schedule in your AVID binder (whether in a page protector, folder, or binder pocket) so if you forget your schedule, you have it right there for you."
