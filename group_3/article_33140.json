      "title": "Listen",
      "content": "Listen to the phone guy. The phone guy was a previous security guard at Freddy Fazbear's Pizza. He will give you useful and important information. Some of the information he gives is to check security cameras often, as well as to close doors and turn on lights only if necessary. However, you should only be checking Cam 4C on Nights 1 and 2. On Nights 3 onward, you should be checking whatever camera Freddy is on to stall him, which also works well because any and all camera activity stalls Foxy, regardless of camera. Phone Guy also give some background information on the restaurant itself, so if you're very into the lore, listen closely on the last bit of his message. As the nights go on, the Phone Guy's messages will be shorter and will mostly apply to the day's events pertaining to the animatronics, and what you should do on that night. Many of his instructions are meant to throw the player off, such as the \"play dead\" instruction. \"Playing dead\" while an animatronic is near the Office is a surefire way to get yourself killed. The movement patterns of the animatronics will be much faster than the first night. On the fourth night, the Phone Guy has recorded his last message. In the recording, you can hear animatronic noises, then Freddy's jingle, the Toreador March. An animatronic jumpscare scream is heard, and the call is cut short. Many have used this phone call to connect FNAF 1 and FNAF 2, since Phone Guy is alive in FNAF 2, therefore making FNAF 2 a prequel."

      "title": "Use power sparingly.",
      "content": "Use power sparingly. You have a limited power supply for each night. If you run out of power, Freddy will catch you, unless you make it to 6 AM before his jingle ends. Your shifts last for six hours, from 12 AM to 6 AM, so keep this in mind while rationing power. The transition from 5 AM to 6 AM can interrupt Freddy's attack if you run out of power, so try to survive until 5 AM and 1 minute at the least. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Be very careful from the third night on. While the game will still be tough the first two days, especially for more inexperienced or rusty players, the animatronics will become more active on the third night. Be sure to have most of your power saved, at least 50% by 3 AM. You'll need it much more on nights three, four, five and six."

      "title": "Understand the animatronics behavior.",
      "content": "Understand the animatronics behavior. There are five animatronics in the game: Bonnie the Bunny, Chica the Chicken, Foxy the Pirate Fox, Freddy Fazbear, and Golden Freddy. Bonnie and Chica come from the left and right doors, having a random path. [2] X Research source Foxy has a rare chance to appear on Night 1. To deal with him, you simply need to check the cameras. It was once believed that you could only stall Foxy by checking on his camera specifically, 4C, but it has been proved that any general camera activity will stall him. Freddy comes to the right in a single path. To stall him, you must watch the camera he is currently on, unlike Foxy. Golden Freddy is summoned through a poster that has a literal one-in-a-million chance of appearing on Cam 2B."

      "title": "Be prepared for the fifth night.",
      "content": "Be prepared for the fifth night. The Phone Guy will not have a message for you that night, so you will be on your own. The animatronics will be as active as ever as this is the last main night, and this is the one that you'll need your power the most. On night five you get a strange, garbled phone call that is speculated to come from Freddy. It's quite possible that after Phone Guy's death, the animatronics had access to the phone, which is why you receive this. This call has been confirmed to come from the book \"Autobiography of a Yogi.\" Don't let it distract you though! [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Do your best. If this is your first time playing, be prepared. Five Nights at Freddy's is somewhat weird, and very scary. Be prepared for not just the fifth night, but things like jumpscares, animatronics traveling, and much more! [4] X Research source If you have succeeded in surviving the fifth night, you can play night six and seven. Upon beating Night 6 you can unlock night 7. Here you can set the animatronic's AI difficulty. Setting Freddy to 1, Bonnie to 9, Chica to 8, and Foxy to 7, when you press \"Go!\", instantly, Golden Freddy's jumpscare appears, indicating that the child haunting Golden Freddy was killed in 1987. There is a lot of speculation and theories about this."
