[1] X Research source There are multiple depilatory creams on the market, so ensure you choose one that’s safe for intimate or private areas. Depilatories designed for the pubic area contain gentler chemicals that can cause less irritation. Depilatory creams are usually painless and effective but have a strong and unpleasant odor. They also don’t permanently remove hair. [2] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Dermatology Professional organization made of over 20,000 certified dermatologists Go to source"

Dab a quarter-sized amount of cream somewhere on your skin and leave it on for the amount of time listed on the package. Rinse the cream off once the time runs out or if you feel any burning or stinging. Keep an eye on your skin to see if you develop any irritation (redness, itchiness, etc.) over the next day.

If you don’t notice any skin reactions, then the cream is safe for you to use. If you develop redness or a rash, find a different product or try a different method."
