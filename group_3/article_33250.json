Beware of tools, they will mine certain blocks quicker. If you collect 8 emeralds, you can add obsidian to the bed as well! Don't build a cube around your bed. Instead, put one block on each side of the bed, not including the corners, then sneak to put 2 blocks on top of the bed. Add from this first layer by putting blocks on the side and on top of any visible blocks on the previous layer. Add water to the top of the bed defense to prevent TNT explosions.

[18] X Research source Rushers quickly bridge to left and right diamond generators and then build up above the enemy beds that are in those directions. The defenders save up to 36 iron. One defender will buy TNT, 12 endstone, and 4 glass, and the other will buy TNT and 12 glass. Then, construct the butterfly defenses quickly, rush and follow behind their rusher with TNT. After the defenders TNT the enemy beds, they and the rushers drop down, break the bed, and fight. If they die before finishing off the adjacent enemy teams, keep trying to eliminate them. Once the adjacent enemy teams are eliminated, the whole team attacks the last team.

Once the second player has acquired 4 gold, they buy TNT and spend the iron buying as much wool as possible to create a 1-layer wool defense. Then, they quickly follow behind the bridger with their TNT. They TNT the enemy team, break their bed, and eliminate them.

Use an extra layer of wool and wood for added protection. [19] X Research source Butterfly defense is usually only used in the 3v3v3v3 or 4v4v4v4, but it can be used in all modes. [20] X Research source The extra layer of wool and wood requires 32 blocks, which cost 8 iron (wool) or 8 gold (wood). With the butterfly defense, the enemy team cannot easily break the blocks with TNT. If they do, it is still extremely difficult for them to break the bed. Additionally, you can block off the opening with wool. Using endstone makes it hard for the defense to be broken without a pickaxe."
