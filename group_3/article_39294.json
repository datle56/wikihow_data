Work it in to ensure your roots absorb as much as the rest of your hair. Give your hair a minute or two to absorb it. Do your research. Conditioner serves as an adequate substitute for shaving products in a pinch. However, since it was not designed for this specific use, it may not have been tested for it. [1] X Research source For long-term use, do some comparison-shopping. Check labels for any warnings, recommendations, or red-flag ingredients like sodium lauryl sulfate, which dehydrates the skin and removes natural oils. For best peace of mind, use a toxin-free product made with natural herbal ingredients."
