      "content": "Your massage gun may need a refresh. To reset your massage gun, make sure the device is completely off, then take a paperclip (or a similarly thin, long object) and insert it into the massage gun’s reset button while you press the gun’s power button. Hold the button for 10 seconds or so and release. [1] X Research source If you don't have a paperclip handy, get creative: try a safety pin, an earring, or even a piece of mechanical pencil lead (just be sure not to break it!)."

      "content": "If your massage gun didn't reset, make sure it has been turned on. Most massage guns have a light to indicate when they’re on and ready to go, so before you resort to contacting the manufacturer or shelling out hundreds of dollars for a new massage gun, double-check that you’ve done everything you can to turn it on. Some massage guns require you to hold the power button down for as many as 10 seconds, and it can be easy to misjudge how long you’ve held that button for. [2] X Research source Other massage guns have a switch you must flip to turn it on, in addition to pressing the ON button. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Your massage gun might just be in need of a jolt. If your massage gun isn’t charged, let it charge for 20 or 30 minutes or so, and then try resetting it. Your gun should have an LED light to indicate when the battery is low as well as a light to indicate that it is charging properly. Even if your gun is not completely dead, a low battery (around 10% to 15% battery) can affect its performance. [4] X Research source Some massage guns automatically turn off while they are charging for safety purposes. If you are trying to charge your massage gun and use it at the same time, this may be why it won’t turn on. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Only charge your massage gun when it needs it. It sounds counterproductive, but charging constantly can actually weaken your massage gun. Yes, you want your massage gun to be fully charged—but if you leave your gun on the charger all the time, its performance could become affected. [6] X Research source Resist the urge to charge your massage gun until the battery is low. Consistently charging when the battery is high may weaken your gun over time. Remove your massage gun from the charger once it has finished fully charging."

If you try to charge your massage gun with a charger that wasn’t designed for it, your massage gun may not charge, or it may become permanently damaged. If you no longer have your original charger, contact the manufacturer for a replacement charger. Make sure your charger is not broken. If your charging cable or charging port are damaged, or if the charger is simply old and worn out, you may need to replace them. [7] X Research source"

If you have reached your massage gun’s stall force, it will shut down, but you should be able to turn it back on after letting it rest for 10 or 20 minutes. [9] X Research source Some massage guns have a stall force of 30 or so pounds, while others have a stall force of 80 pounds. Refer to your massage gun’s information booklet to see what the stall force is. [10] X Research source To prevent your massage gun from reaching its stall force in the future, avoid applying more than the designated amount of pressure to your gun."

      "content": "If your massage gun overheats, the only thing to do is wait. When the electric motor in your massage gun gets too hot, it can cause your massage gun to turn off, and the best thing to do is wait for it to cool off again. Allow your massage gun to cool down for 20 or 30 minutes, and then try restarting it. [11] X Research source Don’t worry if your massage gun shuts off now and again when it gets too hot; occasional overheating is almost inevitable. But if your massage gun is overheating all the time, or if your gun doesn’t turn on again after cooling down, this may be a sign your gun is malfunctioning. [12] X Research source Some massage guns automatically shut down when the motor gets too hot for safety purposes. So if your gun shuts down after overheating, this is a sign it is working correctly, not incorrectly. [13] X Research source"

By limiting the amount of time you have your massage gun on, you may be able to prevent its shutting down as often.

If you’re still having trouble resetting your massage gun, it is worth it to see if the manufacturer will honor your warranty. Some massage guns come with a year warranty; others come with a lifetime warranty. If your warranty is still intact, you may be able to receive a refund or a replacement gun from the manufacturer. [17] X Research source Make sure you check your warranty prior to fiddling with your device yourself. If you try to fix your device yourself, you run the risk of damaging it further, which can void or affect your warranty. [18] X Research source"
