      "content": "Figure out how wide to open your mouth. There are all types of smiles - wide, toothy grins that show all of your teeth, more subtle smiles that put just the top row of teeth on display, mostly closed-mouth smiles that reveal just a glimmer of white, and completely closed smiles that show no teeth at all. By choosing how wide to open your mouth, you can control how the world sees your teeth. Practice different degrees of openness to see which smile looks best on you. It's your smile, and there are no rules about how it should look! That said, try to get comfortable revealing at least a glimpse of your teeth when you smile, because it's very hard to keep your mouth closed when you smile out of happiness. Aim to smile in a way that helps you look your best while also creating a natural-looking expression of cheer. Keep in mind that a smile is often the first impression we have of other people. Think about meeting someone for the first time: what would impression would you get if they seemed to be making an effort to keep their mouth closed instead of breaking into a full smile? It's better to reveal some teeth and have your smile look natural than to close your mouth and look as though you are hiding something. Projecting confidence is more important than projecting perfection, so open up!"

See how it balances out your mouth and enables you to close your mouth more and still achieve a happy smile. A Duchenne smile is very difficult to fake.
