      "content": "Write the note. Keep your note as small as possible. Close it into a square as small as it will go, and keep your handwriting tiny. Remember, you are trying to be inconspicuous."

      "title": "Stretch your hand over the edge of the receiver's desk and let the note drift down.",
      "content": "Stretch your hand over the edge of the receiver's desk and let the note drift down. A simpler way to pass the note is to place your hand on the receiver's desk as if steadying yourself and letting the note slide out. Or if your neighbor has a purse or bag that is slightly open, you can drop the note in there."
    },
    {
      "title": "Watch the teacher.",
      "content": "Watch the teacher. If your eyes are focused on them, it will be much easier to tell when to hide."
    },
    {
      "title": "Plan ahead.",
      "content": "Plan ahead. If you know you'll have a class together with the receiver try to sit in front of, or behind them, instead of next to each other or rows apart. It's less obvious to pass notes over your shoulder than across rows."
    },
    {
      "title": "Write your notes in a notebook.",
      "content": "Write your notes in a notebook. If you have notebooks for the class (the study for a test type), write your note with the paper inside the notebook. It will look like you're writing down and sharing notes about what the teacher was going on about - not what a cute guy just said to you."
    },
    {
      "title": "Get a friend to ask you to borrow a pen.",
      "content": "Get a friend to ask you to borrow a pen. Write the note on a piece of paper small enough to fit inside the cap of a pen. Roll the paper and place it inside of the pen. Pass it to the receiver. After that, just wait for them to pass the pen back! They can replace your note with another note and pass it back. Just remember to watch the teacher!"
    },
    {
      "title": "Put your note on a certain page in a textbook.",
      "content": "Put your note on a certain page in a textbook. Take tiny Post-it notes and stick them inside the textbook. Write different notes to direct the receiver like, turn to page 3, and turn to page 66, until they find the note. It will look like you or the receiver is studying instead of reading the note."

      "content": "Keep a spare note handy. Just in case your teacher sees you and asks you to bring the note up, have an extra note handy that is about something relating to class but not cheating.

      "content": "Toss the note. It can be in a pocket, purse, or the back of a book with a fake note pretending that it was impulsive so no one will know. If you've already been called up, you should have both notes handy to make the hiding obvious."

      "content": "Use a one-subject spiral notebook to write your notes. Instead of using individual pages, just pass the notebook. Some advantages include: A spiral notebook can look like you are sharing notes about the class. It doesn't tempt others to read or intercept it. It's bigger so passing it long distances isn't wise. It's easy to pass to someone sitting close. It doesn't scream \"note\"."

If you have a mechanical pencil, take off the top part (where you usually put in the lead) and put your note in there. Then put the top back on and pass it to your friend. It will seem like you were just lending them a pencil. Alternatively, this also works with pens with caps and removable grips. Just follow the same steps as for mechanical pencils, but keep hold of the removed grip, and pass the pen holding the cap to cover the note."
