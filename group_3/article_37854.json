Interval training that transitions between fast sprints and recovery jogs helps to build speed over time.

Some people can increase their running distance by not being restricted by the length or tempo of their playlist.

[2] X Expert Source Francisco Gomez Fitness Coach Expert Interview. 24 October 2019. You can injure your feet by wearing improper footwear, so make sure to get your feet fitted by a specialist. Road running shoes should be worn on concrete and other hard, man-made surfaces. Trail running shoes should be worn for off-road running on dirt trails, sandy beaches, and rocky or muddy paths. Know if you have a high-arch, a normal arch, or a flat foot. The arch of your foot will determine how your foot moves as you run. If your foot hits the ground equally, choose a neutral shoe. If you over-pronate your foot by rolling inward too much, choose a shoe for stability or motion control. If you supinate your foot by rolling outward too much, choose a shoe with a lot of cushioning and flexibility. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Warm up and stretch. Slowly jog half of a mile before stretching. Doing so allows you to warm up your joints and muscles before you stretch them, thus preventing injury. Be sure to perform dynamic stretches that include motion such as: Leg lifts. Swing one leg out to the side as far as you can swing it, and then swing it back across your body in front of your standing leg, as far as possible. Repeat this stretch ten times on each leg. Cheerleader Kicks. Keep your back and knees straight, and walking forward, lift your legs straight out in front in an exaggerated march, and flex your toes towards you. Butt kicks. Perform an exaggerated running-in-place motion while standing to loosen up your knees, hamstrings, and quads. Walking lunges. Squat into a wide lunge with one foot dramatically out in front of the other, and continue to switch between legs as you slowly progress forward. Shoulder stretches. Don't forget to stretch your torso and shoulders to prevent cramping during your run. You use your arms to propel you forward when you sprint, so you'll need to be loose and limber. Pull one arm straight across your chest and hug it in with the forearm of your other arm. Switch sides and stretch the other arm."

Salmon is one of the best sources of Omega-3 beneficial fats, which promote a healthy inflammation response. An increase in Omega-3's in your diet may also help reduce the symptoms of asthma. One egg a day will give you 30% your daily value of Vitamin K, which promotes healthy bones. In addition, eggs contain all of the essential amino acids that aid in muscle recovery. After a long run, your body will thank you for replenishing your store of amino acids. Avoid a diet high in red meat or processed meat. Both are thought to increase the risk of colorectal cancer, heighten bad cholesterol levels, and contribute to clogged arteries and a higher risk of heart attack."
