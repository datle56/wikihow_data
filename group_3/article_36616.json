      "content": "Floss. You might accumulate yellow matter between your teeth if you are not flossing regularly. Flossing can instantly remove a lot of the build-up between your teeth that causes discoloration. Make sure to make flossing part of your daily routine. Use a good amount of floss — it should be about 18 inches in length. Grip the floss tightly in each hand, and move the floss up and down between each tooth. Curve the floss into a \"C\" shape, so that you are covering the entire surface. Use fresh sections of floss as you move around your mouth. Do at least six up and down movements on each tooth surface. Be gentle — don't damage your gums."
