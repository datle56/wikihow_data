      "content": "Get the recipient's carrier. Each carrier (Verizon, AT&T, etc) has a specific email gateway that you will have to go through in order to email a text message. If you don't know the person's carrier off the top of your head, you can enter their 10 digit phone number into a carrier lookup system such as CarrierLookup or FoneFinder. Some cell phones cannot receive MMSs, even when sent from email. If you are using the correct gateway and still have having trouble getting a message through, it's possible that the phone you're trying to contact does not accept MMS messages."

Here is a list of some of the most common carrier gateways: [1] X Research source AT&T: number@txt.att.net [2] X Research source for a normal text message (SMS), or number@mms.att.net for a multimedia message (MMS) Verizon: number@vtext.com [3] X Research source for both SMS and MMS messages Sprint PCS: number@messaging.sprintpcs.com for both SMS and MMS messages T-Mobile: number@tmomail.net for both SMS and MMS messages Virgin Mobile: number@vmobl.com for both SMS and MMS messages These gateways change periodically and are not always published for non-subscribers.

      "content": "Enter your text in the body of the email. Although you can technically include a subject, doing so will take away from the body of your text, as most text messages have a 160-character limit. [5] X Research source Texts that exceed the character limit will be broken up into multiple messages. While your emails will be free, the recipient will be charged per message (unless they have unlimited texting). Images and videos will automatically be sent as an MMS message."
