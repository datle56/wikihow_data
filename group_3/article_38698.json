      "title": "Go to the Gumtree website.",
      "content": "Go to the Gumtree website. Use your browser to search for “Gumtree.” The homepage for Gumtree should be the first result in the search list.

      "title": "Create a username and password.",
      "content": "Create a username and password. To make an account on Gumtree, you will need to create a username for the site. Choose a username that does not give out too much personal information yourself. Use a nickname or a variation on your name. You may need to add numbers to the end of the username if it has already been taken by another user on Gumtree. For example, you may have a username like “ThrifyOne555.” Use a password that you can remember easily. Try to have a combination of letters and numbers so the password is strong and hard to guess."

    {
      "title": "Add a profile picture.",
      "content": "Add a profile picture. You can use a picture of yourself or a photo of something appealing, such as your dog or cat.

Try to include sub-categories like “Furniture” in “Home & Garden” or “Electronics” in “Computers & Software.” This will make it easier for buyers to search for your item. You can also use the “Tell us what you are posting” option on Gumtree. You can then type in the item and the site will categorize it for you."

    {
      "title": "Note your selling location.",
      "content": "Note your selling location. Type in your postal code to mark your selling location so buyers can search for your item that way. Gumtree will then show your item to buyers in your local area. Your postal code will not appear in the ad. Gumtree will use your postal code to classify your ad based on location."
    },
    {
      "title": "Describe the item in detail.",
      "content": "Describe the item in detail. Include the type of item you are selling, the material it is made of, and the condition of the item. Note the measurements or dimensions of the item and include a reason why you are selling it. [1] X Research source For example, you may have a description like, “Beautiful walnut dining chair with blue upholstered seat. In good condition with no marks or scratches. It is 34” (84 cm) long x 20” (50 cm) wide. Changed decor so no space for it.” Be honest in your description and do not oversell the item.

[2] X Research source Include pictures of the item from several angles. Take a wide shot of the item as well as a close-up shot. If the item has a unique design on the bottom or side, take a photo of this detail and include it in your ad. Put at least one to two good photos of the item on the ad. The more good photos you have of the item on your ad, the better your chances of selling it."

      "title": "Arrange payment for the item with the buyer.",
      "content": "Arrange payment for the item with the buyer. You should always be paid in cash for the item in person. Arrange a pick up place that is convenient for you, such as your office or a nearby parking lot. If you offer delivery, set up a drop off spot with the buyer. Always get the cash for the item first in person before handing over the item. If you are worried about meeting the buyer in person on your own due to safety, bring a friend with you. Meet the buyer in a public place. In rare cases, you may offer to mail the item to the buyer. If so, discuss adding extra money to the sale amount with the buyer for postage and packaging."
