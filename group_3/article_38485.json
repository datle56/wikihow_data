You may find you fit the description of your astrological sign, or you may not (just like your Gemini may or may not have the characteristics of his sign). Geminis are most compatible with the following signs:] Libra, September 23 – October 22 : Geminis and Libras are compatible because of their ability to communicate and socialize well. They also share a love of art, culture, and adventure. Scorpio, October 23 – November 21 : Scorpios tend to enjoy privacy. This can clash with a Gemini’s need to be social and outgoing with others. Geminis also have a light-hearted approach to life, which can be counter to Scorpio’s intense and private nature. However, for highly intelligent Gemini, Scorpio may be the perfect partner as the Scorpio can engage in enriching, deep discussions, talk openly about sex without judgement, engage in playful sex as the expert sex sign and most loyal sign of the Zodiac, and is an expert at flirting with the mysterious play and openness Gemini craves. Scorpio and Gemini share the arts, sexual adventure, strong needs for loyalty, and intelligence. The twin nature of Gemini -- the social, public side and the private, intimate side, is just the mystery Scorpio adores and respects. Aquarius, January 20 – February 18. : Aquarius is a good match with Gemini because both signs thrive on variety and change. Both signs are also good at socializing and communication. Many Aquarians and Gemini signs end up becoming close friends and romantic partners. Aries, March 21 – April 19 : This is a good match because both signs are full of drive and energy. Aries have a flare for leadership that will complement Gemini’s resourcefulness. Both signs also have a passion for knowledge and learning. Leo, July 23 – August 22 : Leos tend to be outgoing, dramatic, and bold. They are a good complement to the creativity and intelligence of a Gemini. Both signs tend to feed off of each other’s energy and enjoy making others, and themselves, laugh. [22] X Research source"
