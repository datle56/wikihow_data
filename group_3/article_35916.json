      "title": "Pick something active that still allows for conversation.",
      "content": "Pick something active that still allows for conversation. Do something totally different than what you did on the first date. Hiking, walking through a park, swimming, or even lightly jogging are great second date activities. You can fill any awkward pauses by focusing on the activity at-hand, and if you want to end the date early, you can say that you’re too tired out to continue. [1] X Research source You could also try mini golfing, bowling, having a picnic, walking along the beach, or visiting a rooftop bar. Just avoid anything that would prevent you two from chatting, like a crowded bar or a movie theater."

      "title": "The second date is when you can let your hair down a bit.",
      "content": "The second date is when you can let your hair down a bit. If you dressed up for your first date, you can keep things a little more casual on the second one. [2] X Research source Pick an outfit that fits you well, and make sure you feel your best before you head out the door. [3] X Expert Source Laura Bilotta Dating Coach & Matchmaker Expert Interview. 4 March 2020. Think about what you’re doing on your date, too. For an afternoon stroll through the park, jeans and sneakers are probably your best bet. For a night out at a bar, your best slacks or a flowy dress might be more fitting."

      "title": "By now, you know your date enough to hug them and say hello.",
      "content": "By now, you know your date enough to hug them and say hello. When you both show up to the date, give them a quick hug, and a peck on the cheek if you’re feeling it. This shows that you’re willing to break the touch barrier with them, and that you don’t mind a small amount of PDA. [4] X Research source If your date flinches or pulls back from your hug, they might not be comfortable with you just yet. That’s okay—just give them time."

      "title": "Move past the small talk into genuine topics of conversation.",
      "content": "Move past the small talk into genuine topics of conversation. On your first date together, you probably learned all about your date’s job and education. On the second date, it’s time to ask your date some deeper questions—try talking about their goals, their childhood, and their family. [5] X Research source “Did you grow up around here?” “Where do you see yourself in 5 years?” “Are you close with your family?” “What do you get up to on the weekends?” “What’s your favorite way to relax?”"

[6] X Expert Source Laura Bilotta Dating Coach & Matchmaker Expert Interview. 4 March 2020. Try to get a good back-and-forth going—you ask your date a question, then your date asks you a question. Avoid dominating the conversation, since that can make your date feel overwhelmed. [7] X Research source You can also ask your date follow-up questions, like, “Interesting, can you tell me more?” and, “What do you mean?”"

      "content": "There might be some lulls in the conversation, and that’s okay. A little bit of awkwardness is all part of getting to know someone—your date will understand! Don’t feel like you have to fill the silence 100% of the time. Sometimes, riding it out is the best way to get through it. [8] X Research source You could even make a joke about it. “Wow, that sure was awkward, wasn’t it?”"

      "title": "Let your date know that you’re definitely interested in them.",
      "content": "Let your date know that you’re definitely interested in them. A second date means that there was initial attraction on both sides. When you’re with your date, let them know that you’re still into them by giving them cheeky compliments throughout your time together. [11] X Research source “I really like your smile. It lights up a room.” “When we met up for our first date, I thought, ‘Wow, I can’t wait to learn more about this person.’”"

      "title": "Show your date that you’re comfortable by lightly touching their hand or arm.",
      "content": "Show your date that you’re comfortable by lightly touching their hand or arm. Throughout your date, you might have the opportunity to grab your date’s hand or pat them on the shoulder. Doing this will show that you’re interested in them, and it will bring you two closer together as well. [12] X Research source You might pat them on the shoulder as you laugh at their joke, or grab their hand as you walk through a park."

      "content": "By the second date, most people are ready for some physical contact. If you and your date have had a blast together, they’re probably okay with a light smooch. [13] X Expert Source Laura Bilotta Dating Coach & Matchmaker Expert Interview. 4 March 2020. When you say goodbye, lean in slightly and give your date a kiss on the lips, but keep it short. Tell them you had a great time. “This was so much fun. Thanks for taking me out tonight. I’d love to do it again soon.” “I had a great time with you! Let’s set something up for next week.” For most people on a second date, a kiss is as far as they’ll want to go in terms of intimacy. There aren’t any rules about when you two should have sex, but don’t worry about doing anything you don’t want to do."

Don’t worry about any “rules” for how long you should wait—if you want to see your date again, tell them that! [14] X Research source “Hope you got home safe! I had such an amazing time. Are you free at all this weekend?” “Thanks for walking me home tonight. Want to get together next week for drinks? I’m free on Tuesday.”"
