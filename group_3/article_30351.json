      "content": "Trick your brain into enjoyment. Even when a class is just plain boring, you can surprisingly convince your brain at least to some degree that you’re having fun. It sounds too good to be true, but try it. Simply think to yourself, \"Hey, I’m actually kind of into this stuff. I’m starting to really enjoy this class.” [1] X Research source Believe it or not, the old adage that time flies when you’re having fun is actually supported by how your brain works. Accordingly, tell yourself you’re having fun even if you admittedly aren’t having a blast to make if feel like time is passing more quickly."

      "content": "Sit somewhere new. As simple as it sounds, changing your visual perspective of the world will help make time pass more quickly because your mind will be occupied by all the new information. Even the same classroom will look entirely different from a new angle. Your brain will be monitoring new information without you even thinking about it, making time pass more quickly. [2] X Research source Novelty can be a powerful tool to help you find joy in what you're doing, and enjoyment can help time fly by. It's easy to get stuck in a rut during the school year, but finding even small new stimuli can help get you out of those ruts. [3] X Research source"

Educational Leadership Consultant Expert Interview. 11 November 2020. Try keeping notes in bullet points, short paragraphs, or even with small, relevant drawings every so often, and stick with what you enjoy.

      "title": "Challenge yourself to follow the material more closely.",
      "content": "Challenge yourself to follow the material more closely. Challenging ourselves with specific tasks increases the energy and excitement with which we approach that task. It works even better when the challenge has a bit of drama built in. To heighten your own level of focus, imagine a quick scenario in which you must complete the trying task of complete concentration, or else! [6] X Research source For instance, pretend the teacher is a werewolf, but only morphs into a frothing-mouthed beast when she sees students eyes fully glaze over. There have been mysterious disappearances in her class every year. Can your class be the one that escapes unscathed, with full knowledge of the teacher’s lessons? Challenge yourself to accomplish specific tasks. If you’re usually quiet, make a point of speaking up next class. If you usually finish your in-class work quickly, see if you can work through something with another student who hasn’t finished."

      "content": "Get physical during breaks or recess. In between classes or at recess, do something physical. Your breaks will be especially beneficial if you switch from your brain to your body at various points throughout the day. This will help get rid of the ants in your pants and rejuvenate your mind for consistent learning. Even if only for five minutes, find a corner where you can stretch or do a few yoga poses. Get the heart pumping by doing 10 pushups and 20 jumping jacks."

Though you may need to catch up on some homework, don’t let school responsibilities dominate your weekend or the weeks will only continue to drag on and on.

One way to ensure you’re always busy and socially engaged is by taking advantage of the extracurricular opportunities offered by your school. Join a sports team for an especially fun way to meet friends, stay healthy, and occupy your time constructively. Another great option is joining the school band. The ability to play an instrument is likely one that you’ll enjoy the rest of your life, and there’s something especially fun about band people. Another option, if available, is a drama club. Acting can prepare you for public speaking or presentations and can be a great way to try something new. Challenge yourself to find an activity outside of your comfort zone. When you are comfortable with something, it can get predictable or boring. Look for new opportunities for growth or seek out new people to help keep the year fun and interesting."

Take a moment to ask yourself, \"What can I learn from this class?\" [13] X Research source Find out if a teacher who may be a bit dry during lecture is more interesting to talk to one on one.
