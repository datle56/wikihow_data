You’re about to begin a new and thrilling chapter, perhaps in the form of a new job or a romantic relationship , and your guardian angels are giving you a heads-up.

      "content": "Ringing in the right ear could be a sign to stay on your toes. Though the right ear is usually associated with positive tidings, it’s possible your guardian angels are trying to warn you that there are people around you who may not have your spiritual interests in mind. If you hear a ringing in your right ear, it could be a sign that the energies around you are not positive. You may have heard that when your ear rings, it’s a sign that someone is thinking badly of you—well, that may be the case here! Evaluate your current relationships to see if there are any connections that could be improved. [3] X Research source But don’t dwell too much on connecting with negative energies : at some point, it’s best to just distance yourself to protect your spiritual well-being."

      "content": "It could indicate someone is speaking positively of you. While ringing in the ear could be a sign someone's negative energy is affecting you, it could also mean just the opposite: that people see your worth and love and admire you, and they're thinking kindly of you! Whether you've done a favor for someone lately, or you just try to live a selfless, friendly life , someone is taking notice. Go you! Old wives' tales also indicate that when your ear rings, it means someone is talking about you or thinking of you. Some old wives' tales say your ear will also burn when this happens! [4] X Research source Pliny the Elder, the Ancient Roman scholar, held to the superstition that ringing in the ears is a sign angels are discussing you. He also advocated for boiling earthworms in goose grease and sticking them in your ear if your ear ringing, or any other ear malady, is bothering you. (We don't recommend that!)

      "content": "The ear may be used to hear messages from God. Multiple times in the book of Revelations, God says, \"Whoever has ears, let them hear what the Spirit says to the churches.\" The \"hearing\" He speaks of is not literal sounds, but spiritual ones: the Holy Spirit speaks to you in messages nobody else can hear, and the messages may come in the form of words, or they may come in the form of ringing. [7] X Research source This interpretation is backed up by Job 13:17, in which God says, “Listen carefully to what I say; let my words ring in your ears.\" If your ears are ringing, it's a sign from God to pay attention to His messages!

      "content": "You may have tinnitus. Tinnitus is the medical term for ear-ringing, and it’s very common, especially among older people who may suffer from age-related hearing loss.

Tinnitus may present as ringing, buzzing, or humming, and it may persist for a period of time, or it may come and go. Unless it interrupts your daily life, there’s usually no need to see a doctor about it.
