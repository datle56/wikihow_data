This will help prevent any splatters from dirtying your microwave. [4] X Research source You can also use microwave-safe plastic wrap, but just make sure to pull back a corner of it for venting.

      "content": "Cook the egg in the microwave. Place the bowl in the microwave and cook on the highest setting for 45 seconds. When it's done, remove the paper towel and inspect the egg. The white should be set, but the yolk should be runny. [6] X Research source If the white is still liquid, put it back in the microwave and cook for an additional 10-15 seconds. When the white is no longer runny, your egg is done cooking. For a hard-cooked egg (a firmer yolk, similar to a hard-boiled egg) cook on the highest power setting for 60 seconds to start, then continue in 10-second increments until done. Microwave wattages will vary, so adjust these cooking times as needed based on your microwave's power. If your microwave is a higher wattage (900-1000 watts), your egg may need a bit less time. If your microwave is a lower wattage (600-800 watts), it may need more time. [7] X Research source"
