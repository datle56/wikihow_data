      "content": "Energetic You’re practically overflowing with energy and enthusiasm if you have a Mars in Sagittarius placement! You likely have several projects in progress at any given time because you have so many ideas (and the boundless energy to explore them all).

    {
      "title": "Curious",
      "content": "Curious Knowledge is power when you have a Mars in Sagittarius placement. You’re curious and determined to absorb every scrap of information you come across! You’re always working to expand your knowledge of the world around you, extremely open-minded, and eager to explore all perspectives. In your mind, closed-minded thinking limits your ability to learn new things. Sagittarius is a mutable sign; mutable signs are known for being flexible, adaptable, and comfortable with change. Thus, when you have a Mars in Sagittarius placement, your open-mindedness and flexibility often come from Sagittarius’ mutable modality. Your curiosity and desire to explore new perspectives also means you love a friendly debate! You love philosophizing and explaining your thought processes—though you may take it personally when others don’t agree with you."

    {
      "title": "Honest",
      "content": "Honest When you have a Mars in Sagittarius placement, truth and honesty are incredibly important to you. You won’t stand for any dishonesty from friends or partners, and you’re always unafraid to say exactly what’s on your mind. You’ve got a reputation for integrity and straightforwardness—though you may also be blunt and a bit insensitive at times. When you say exactly what you’re thinking, you may not think it through beforehand! If you have Mars in Sagittarius on your chart, try considering your words before saying them and being a little more sensitive to everyone else’s feelings. However, if your Mercury placement (which influences your communication style) is more tactful, you may naturally be less blunt than the average Mars in Sagittarius. For example, Cancer and Pisces are both insightful and sensitive signs, so having a Mercury in Cancer or Pisces placement may temper the blunt honesty of Mars in Sagittarius."
