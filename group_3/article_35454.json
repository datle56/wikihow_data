Select your microphone from the \"Choose your input device\" menu on the right panel. Locate the pulsating bar below \"Test your microphone\" in the right panel. Speak into your microphone. If the bar moves as you speak, it is detecting audio through your microphone. If the bar doesn't move, click Device properties right above the bar, and try raising the volume. If you're still having issues, see How to Connect a Microphone to a Computer . Windows Voice Recorder comes pre-installed on most Windows 11 computers and laptops.
