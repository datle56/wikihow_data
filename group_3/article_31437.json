[8] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Professionals consider a body mass index (BMI) of 25 or higher overweight (with 30 meaning obese). Even the moderate loss of some excess weight can lead to dramatic improvement with symptoms. A great exercise routine for shedding extra pounds includes thirty minutes of moderate aerobic activity (such as brisk walking or cycling) five times a week. If you prefer high-intensity workouts (such as playing sports), then aim for seventy-five minutes a week. [9] X Trustworthy Source American Heart Association Leading nonprofit that funds medical research and public education Go to source Note that weight training is not as effective at burning calories as aerobic exercise. In fact, chronic heavy lifting can increase stress incontinence by reducing the strength of your pelvic floor. Learn more about calculating your BMI at How to Calculate Your Body Mass Index (BMI) . Some doctors suggest that you wear a tampon if you are having stress incontinence symptoms when you do exercise like running, as this increases support in the vagina.

Up to 75 percent of women with the condition have success with Kegel exercises to strengthen these muscles (though both men and women can do them). Have patience because it can take weeks or even months to show results. [10] X Research source To perform Kegel exercises, isolate the muscles by intentionally stopping the flow of urine next time you go. [11] X Research source Once you know what using those muscles feels like, hold them tight for an eight count before relaxing them while counting to ten. Do ten repetitions three times daily. [12] X Research source You can also start with a lower count and increase it over time. You can also try vaginal weights, which are cone-shaped weights that you insert into your vagina like a tampon and help to strengthen the pelvic floor muscles. You will start with a low weight, holding it for one minute twice a day. Once you can hold that weight for 15 minutes, you move up to the next heaviest weight. Yoga has also been shown to strengthen the pelvic floor muscles. Postures like fish, pike, or crow work in the very same way as Kegel exercises."
