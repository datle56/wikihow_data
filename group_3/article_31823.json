If one decimal in the list has a higher whole number than the others, it’s automatically the greatest number. If a decimal in the list has a smaller whole number than the others on the list, it’s automatically the smallest number. Let’s say your homework asks you to order the decimals 12.45 , 12.457 , and 11.47 . The whole number 11 is smaller than 12 , so 11.47 is automatically going to be the smallest (least) number."

Going from left to right, label the columns as tens, ones, decimal, tenths, hundredths, and thousandths. [1] X Research source Let’s go back to our old example. Since we already figured out that 11.47 is the smallest decimal, we’re left with 12.45 and 12.457 to sort. Draw a table with 6 columns and 2 rows to fit both numbers. If you were asked to order a list of decimals like 0.3 , 0.4 , 0.01 , 0.02 , and 0.5 , your chart would need to have 5 rows and 4 columns (including one column for the decimal point)."

The number 12.45 only has 4 digits, so you’d add a 0 to the thousandths place (making it 12.450 ). This makes it a lot easier to compare with 12.457 , right?"

[3] X Research source In our chart, both 12.45 and 12.457 have a 4 in the tenths column. So, we’d move onto the hundredths column and make a new comparison. Let’s say you’re asked to compare 0.1 and 0.01 . The decimal 0.1 has a 1 in the tenths column while 0.01 only has a 0 . Therefore, 0.1 is the bigger number."

[4] X Research source Let’s take another glance at our table—both 12.45 and 12.457 have a 5 in the hundredths place, so you’d shift over to the thousandths column for another comparison. Pretend you were asked to compare the decimals 4.04 and 4.02 . The number 4.04 has a 4 in the hundredths place while 4.02 only has a 2 , which makes 4.04 the bigger decimal."

From right to left, the place values of whole numbers are ones, tens, hundreds, thousands, ten-thousands, hundred-thousands, and millions. [12] X Research source In the number 51 the 5 digit is in the tens place. It has a value of 5 tens. In the number 50,001 , the digit 5 is in the ten-thousands place—this gives it a value 5 ten-thousands, or 50,000 . The smallest place value for whole numbers is the ones place. Ten sets of 1 move the 1 into the tens place, while 10 sets of 10 move the number into the hundreds place. See the pattern? This pattern continues for the higher place values."

Starting at the decimal point, the place values are tenths, hundredths, thousandths, ten-thousandths, hundred-thousandths, and millionths. [13] X Research source For example, in the number 1.5 , the digit 5 is in the tenths place. It has the value of 5 tenths, or 5 10 {\\displaystyle {\\frac {5}{10}}} . In the number 1.0005 , however, the digit 5 has a value of 5 ten-thousandths, or 5 10 , 000 {\\displaystyle {\\frac {5}{10,000}}} . The tenths place is the largest place value for fractional numbers. Ten hundredths make one-tenth, 10 thousandths make 1 hundredth, and 10 ten-thousandths create 1 thousandth. When comparing fractional numbers, it helps to convert decimals into fractions : 1 10 > 1 100 {\\displaystyle {\\frac {1}{10}}>{\\frac {1}{100}}} . To convert a fraction into a decimal , simply divide the numerator by the denominator. [14] X Research source"
