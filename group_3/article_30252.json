In order to make a vertical antenna from a coaxial cable, you will need the following materials: [1] X Research source 50 ohm (or 75 ohm) coaxial wire with copper shielding FM receiver with a coaxial connector 3/8-inch copper tubing Wire cutters Hacksaw Soldering equipment"

      "content": "Calculate the length of your antenna. This will determine both how much of the coaxial cable you have to strip and how long your copper tubing should be: Divide 468 by the frequency to which you want to connect (e.g., 468/108MHz would become 4.3). Divide the resulting number by 2 (e.g., 4.3/2 would become 2.15). Multiply the resulting number by 12 inches (30.5 cm) to find the antenna length (e.g., 2.15*12 inches would become 25.8 inches).

      "content": "Cut off one end of the coaxial cable. While you'll want to leave one end of the coaxial cable intact in order for it to serve as the connector, the other end will need to be removed. You can use your wire cutters or a hacksaw to do this."

      "title": "Strip half of the antenna's overall length from the end of the coaxial cable.",
      "content": "Strip half of the antenna's overall length from the end of the coaxial cable. You'll need to remove each layer of shielding until you arrive at the white layer surrounding the coaxial cable itself. For example, if your antenna is supposed to be six inches per your calculations, you'll remove three inches of shielding. [3] X Research source You'll need to remove the copper shielding during this process. The easiest way to do so is by making a shallow incision with the hacksaw all the way around the shielding and then attempting to strip it off from there."

      "content": "Cut the copper tubing to half of the antenna's overall length. The copper tubing will comprise the other half of your antenna's receiver, so it should be the same length as the section that you just stripped. Again, if you're using a six-inch antenna, the copper tubing will be three inches."

You can do this by removing the PVC (black) shielding from around an inch of the coaxial cable directly below the unshielded part, peeling it back with a pair of pliers to form a lip, and then using your soldering pen to connect the lip to the copper tubing."

      "content": "Place the antenna. Once the antenna is plugged in, angle it toward the nearest station and secure it in place if necessary. The fewer obstructions between your antenna and the nearest FM station, the stronger your signal will be. Your coaxial cable may be stiff enough to stand on its own without needing support, but you can use stables or any adhesive to prop up your antenna as needed."

If your connection to an FM station is mostly fine but requires some fine-tuning from time to time, you can use speaker wire as a quick range-extender to improve the quality of your connection. Speaker wire is not an ideal solution to long-range issues. If you're having trouble receiving a signal at all, you should try using coaxial cable instead. [5] X Research source"

These two connections will normally be marked \"FM EXT\" or \"ANT EXT\", but you'll almost always see \"FM\" somewhere near the connection; you should also see the word \"Balanced\" or \"BAL\" near the appropriate connections. FM receivers can have either clamp-and-hold connectors or post connectors. Clamp-and-hold connectors resemble literal clamps, while post connectors resemble knobs with exposed metal between them and the receiver itself. [8] X Research source"
