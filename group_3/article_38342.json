      "title": "Mysterious.",
      "content": "Mysterious. Scorpios are complex, secretive, and alluring. People find it very difficult to read this water sign—try as they might, Scorpio’s walls are too tall to climb. Just when you feel that you’ve scratched the surface, Scorpio throws a curveball, sending you off course. This is, in part, unintentional; Scorpio is complicated and deep, which makes them difficult to truly know. But on the other hand, Scorpio is untrusting, so their mysterious air can also be a way to guard their deepest secrets."

    {
      "title": "Loyal.",
      "content": "Loyal. More than any other sign, Scorpio is a ride-or-die. They have high standards for friends, family, and partners, but in return, they offer intense dedication and protection. They don’t back down in a fight, and don’t lose faith in the face of controversy. They believe that the true sign of a meaningful relationship is devotion, and they take relationships very seriously."

    {
      "title": "Intense.",
      "content": "Intense. Scorpio is known for their passion and depth. To the people closest to Scorpio, this is a gift—relationships feel more fulfilling and life, more exciting. Scorpio makes everyday moments feel rich. They inject life with meaning and emotion, and they know how to create magic in others’ lives too. On the other hand, this intensity can be too much for some, which might leave Scorpio feeling like a liability."
    },
    {
      "title": "Strategic.",
      "content": "Strategic. Scorpio believes that life is a game—one that they’re clever enough to win. This sign is sharp, detail-oriented, and very intuitive. Scorpio notices all of the subtle cues and little signs that the rest of us miss. Scorpio has so much knowledge at their fingertips, and they always have a careful game plan in place. Whether they’re attracting crushes, making friends, or excelling at work, their plan usually wins."

      "title": "Determined.",
      "content": "Determined. Scorpio is one of the hardest-working signs in the zodiac. They bring loyalty and intensity to everything they do, and won’t give up when the going gets tough. This is a sign that believes in digging their heels in—if Scorpio loses, it’ll never be because they didn’t want it enough. In fact, Scorpio is more likely to hold onto things longer than they should."

    {
      "title": "Creative.",
      "content": "Creative. Scorpio is intuitive, insightful, and intelligent. This is what makes them talented in the arts, whether it’s music, poetry, or fashion. Scorpio has a rich inner life, which is great fuel for creative expression. Some Scorpios may not have found time or reason to explore this part of themselves, but when they do, they’ll find that art feels natural, like speaking a language they learned in another life."

    {
      "title": "Enticing.",
      "content": "Enticing. It might be their air of mystery that does it—Scorpios are known for their darkly enchanting ways. They have this powerful, natural sensuality to them, and it draws others in with a magnetic force. This is a sign that’s got a reputation for being…er, lively between the sheets. So, Scorpios are likely to rack up more than a few suitors when they make rounds at a party. Though they may not always seem obviously flirty or romantic, their movements carry an electric charge that’s hard to ignore."

      "title": "Controlling, unforgiving, jealous.",
      "content": "Controlling, unforgiving, jealous. Is it all positive with the moody Scorpion? Every sign has its weaknesses, and Scorpio’s no exception. Combine some of Scorpio’s strengths—intensity, passion, strategic thinking—and together, they might start to look more like manipulation. This sign sometimes gets a rep for being too much in love, because they also have an envious, unforgiving streak. Scorpio would do well to remember that their romances and friendship will be most rewarding when they love others for free (meaning, without strings attached or strict expectations). Loosen the reins a bit, and Scorpio will find that they’ll become an even better partner and friend."

      "title": "Attracting a Scorpio",
      "content": "Attracting a Scorpio So, you’re crushing on a Scorpio—we feel for you. These signs are as intimidating as they are intoxicating, but never fear! Capturing this water sign’s interest is easier than you’d think: Keep an air of mystery. Don’t reveal too much early on. Offer vague answers and continue to turn the spotlight back on Scorpio—they’ll be hooked on you. Have intelligent conversation. Scorpio wants to know that you’re sharp. Bring up a topic that you’re well versed in, and don’t be afraid to share a controversial opinion. Have eyes only for Scorpio. This water sign is territorial. If they spot you making eyes at someone else, they’ll lose interest immediately. Make intense eye contact. Scorpio prefers subtle flirting. Hold their gaze, then break it after a second or two. This’ll drive any Scorpio wild. Say hello, then walk away. Keep building on your mysterious energy. Offer a warm greeting so that you make an impression, then disappear for the night."

      "content": "Signs a Scorpio likes you Scorpio prefers to keep their cards close to the chest, but when they’re crushing on you, they’ll still drop subtle cues. If you want a roadmap to Scorpio’s heart, look out for these telltale signals: They don’t flirt with anyone else. If Scorpio likes you, they’ll focus on that entirely. Scorpio will be sure not to chat up other love interests around you. They stand up for you. Scorpio believes in loyalty. If they’re trying to make an impression, they’ll defend you, in private and in public. They show up wherever you are. Scorpio is subtle, but intentional. Casually showing up at the same party as their crush is a go-to Scorpio move. They say that you’re interesting or seem trustworthy. To Scorpio, these are huge compliments. If Scorpio tells you this, they’re probably into you. They tell you a secret. Phew—this is like a love confession from Scorpio. If they trust you with classified intel, they’re likely seriously interested."

      "title": "What’s it like to date a Scorpio?",
      "content": "What’s it like to date a Scorpio? Scorpio will make you feel like the only person on the planet. Their attention is intense, and if they have feelings for you, it’ll be an otherworldly experience. They create deep, passionate relationships that can feel life-changing. While they’ll have extremely high standards for their partners, especially in terms of trust, they’ll offer the same devotion in return. Date night: Horror movie night. Stargazing at midnight. Listening to old albums in the dark. Swapping secrets over a candlelit dinner. Downside: Scorpios sometimes play mind games in love. Remind Scorpio that that’s no way to build genuine trust, and they’ll cool off."

      "content": "Pisces & Scorpio. This is a fairytale romance fit for film. Feelings will run deep between these two, with Pisces drawing unexpected affection from Scorpio, and Scorpio rousing Pisces in new, exciting ways. They’ll be ultra-romantic together, and challenge each other, too—Scorpio will push Pisces to stand up for themself, and Pisces will convince Scorpio to soften their rougher edges. In love, they’ll each feel adored, understood, and inspired to grow. There’s just one minor issue: Scorpio is known for their sharp words, and Pisces doesn’t always have the thickest skin. During arguments, these two will have to work hard to stay civil."

      "title": "Capricorn & Scorpio.",
      "content": "Capricorn & Scorpio. Talk about a power couple. These two are clever, ambitious, and powerful signs, and together, nothing can get in their way. From the boardroom to the bedroom, Cap and Scorpio will always bring it. In one another, they’ll find the devoted, empowering partner they’ve always desired. Capricorn and Scorpio have big dreams, and in each other’s arms, they’re sure to achieve them. Compatibility is extremely high here. Emotionally though, they’ll have to meet in the middle. Scorpio dreams of love sonnets and serenades, whereas Capricorn prefers a mush-free relationship. Both signs should get comfortable with compromise to keep their partner satisfied."

      "title": "Taurus & Scorpio.",
      "content": "Taurus & Scorpio. These two are dedicated romantic partners, and because of this, their relationship will flourish. Scorpio and Taurus are happy to lie in each other’s arms all weekend, exchanging sweet nothings and promising each other the world. The key here is that both Scorpio and Taurus take love very seriously—so they’ll both feel relieved to finally find a partner who matches their energy and makes concrete commitments. Communication, though, could be a problem area. Scorpio always holds their ground…but so does Taurus. Without a lot of effort, these two could end up in constant spats and stalemates, which is no fun for anyone."

      "title": "Cancer & Scorpio.",
      "content": "Cancer & Scorpio. Intuitive, emotional, and passionate, Scorpio and Cancer have all the ingredients for a lovely romance. Cancer just wants someone to nurture and, whether or not they’ll admit it, Scorpio just wants to be nurtured. Eye contact, face caresses, and secret sharing are sure to follow, and these saps will cherish every second of it. Physical intimacy might be a slight barrier here. Cancer is more into emotional, heartfelt exchanges. Scorpio likes that too, but generally, they’ll ache to mix things up between the sheets. Communication will be helpful here."

    {
      "title": "Scorpio & Scorpio.",
      "content": "Scorpio & Scorpio. Given that Scorpio feels constantly misread and misunderstood, a double-Scorpio relationship seems like it’d be the dream. And in a way, it is: intense romance, steamy intimacy, and deep conversation will happily follow, creating room for an everlasting connection. Imagine the two deepest people you know exploring each other’s psyche in a quiet, calm room—that’s what this romance looks like. But still, Scorpios prefer to wear the crown. In a double-Scorpio relationship, who gets to take the lead? This is a question these two will have to grapple with, and compromise is the only answer. If they can’t manage that, it could lead to a clash of titans."

    {
      "title": "Leo & Scorpio.",
      "content": "Leo & Scorpio. This relationship could easily detonate, but if it doesn’t, it’ll be a dream. In a way, Scorpio is Leo’s perfect partner: they’re beautiful, romantic, and capable of charming a crowd. Scorpio will appreciate Leo’s fierce loyalty and generosity, because these are things they absolutely need in love. Leo and Scorpio also share the same long-term goal, which is to create an intense, devoted partnership with someone worthy of their love. It’s not all smiles here, though. Leo and Scorpio are fixed signs, meaning that they’re tough opponents in a conflict. When fights break out, someone will have to give in (and chances are, they’ll be unhappy about it). Scorpio and Leo’s schedules might clash, too. Scorpio is introverted, a homebody; Leo is under the spotlight at every party. They’ll have to come to an agreement to make things work."

    {
      "title": "Aquarius & Scorpio.",
      "content": "Aquarius & Scorpio. At their best, these two will complement each other effortlessly, and inspire each other endlessly. Aquarius can empower Scorpio to be more open, which ultimately serves Scorpio’s self-growth. Scorpio can help Aquarius express their feelings, which will help them enjoy a richer emotional life. Plus, Aquarius and Scorpio will respect one another’s intellect, and that will take them a long way in romance. That said, this will only work if they bridge the gap. If Scorpio and Aquarius can’t focus on their partner’s strengths, they may feel overwhelmed by differences. Aquarius might see Scorpio as over-emotional and possessive. Scorpio might believe Aquarius is repressed and flaky (ouch!). If it works, it’ll be great—but if not, it could spell trouble."

    {
      "title": "Virgo & Scorpio.",
      "content": "Virgo & Scorpio. Nothing bothers a Virgo like carelessness and flippancy, and Scorpio is the same way. These two signs know what it means to be accountable, and they always do what it takes to please the person they love. Healthy communication will be effortless—Virgo and Scorpio just seem to get one another. This relationship, for the most part, will feel easy, breezy, beautiful. But in love, “easy” isn’t always the goal. For better or worse, Scorpio craves intensity, and they might put that on Virgo’s plate. Virgo, though, doesn’t want romantic highs and lows, so over time, they could come to resent Scorpio for this. Someone may have to settle and adjust."
    },
    {
      "title": "Libra & Scorpio.",
      "content": "Libra & Scorpio. This is an ultra-romantic matchup, magnified by mystery and curiosity. Libra and Scorpio are different; in a way, Libra is light, whereas Scorpio is dark. Libra is easy, but Scorpio is complex. But this divide will only light a fire in their hearts—they’ll intoxicate each other, drawing their partner in naturally and powerfully. The spark is definitely here. But it’s not quite that simple, either. Opposites-attract relationships can be tricky, and if an imbalance occurs, someone could end up hurt, bored, or confused. For best relationship results, these two will need to focus on finding a deeper connection."
    },
    {
      "title": "Aries & Scorpio.",
      "content": "Aries & Scorpio. There’s no shortage of fire between these two. Sexually, they’re likely to have a great time, but romantically, they’ll struggle to keep their spark from metamorphosing into full-fledged flames. Aries and Scorpio are intense and at times, volatile people—in fights, they won’t hold punches. But at the same time, these two signs are deeply passionate, which will please both partners. And on top of that, they both dream of a serious partnership. Shared goals and admiration still create a pretty strong foundation, and that could be enough to fuel a romance. If both partners have more diplomatic placements in their chart, that could solve all of their issues. So ultimately, this couple could still work well."
    },
    {
      "title": "Gemini & Scorpio.",
      "content": "Gemini & Scorpio. Intellectuals at heart, Gemini and Scorpio’s conversation will never run dry…but is that enough to keep a relationship alive? It depends. Scorpio is unlikely to find the passion and emotional intensity they desire from Gemini (much less the commitment). Gemini, on the other hand, might feel smothered by Scorpio. However, their intellectual compatibility is strong, and that’s important to both signs. If the rest of their charts (Venus especially) are compatible, then this could still be a fun, meaningful relationship."
    },
    {
      "title": "Sagittarius & Scorpio.",
      "content": "Sagittarius & Scorpio. This is a tough matchup. Scorpio wants love poems, longing glances, and emotional intensity, 24/7. In love, Sag would prefer a best friend with benefits—and that is not Scorpio’s idea of grand romance. Plus, neither sign is likely to budge in a conflict, so maintaining healthy communication could also be a struggle. But still, they shouldn’t give up hope just yet. Miraculously enough, there’s definitely a spark here. Scorpio’s mystery and Sag’s effortless charm will be enough to draw them together, and that’s huge. Though this relationship is full of challenges, if Sag has some romantic placements and Scorpio has some more relaxed ones, this relationship could work well."
