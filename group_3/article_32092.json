      "title": "Measure your print to determine the right packaging size.",
      "content": "Measure your print to determine the right packaging size. To package your prints properly, you’ll need to buy appropriately sized packing material. If you don’t already know the size of the print, measure it before you obtain any sleeves or envelopes. For example, if your print is 8.5 by 11 inches (22 by 28 cm), a 9.75 by 12.25 in (24.8 by 31.1 cm) rigid mailing envelope will work well."

      "title": "Slide a cardboard backing sheet into a sealable plastic sleeve.",
      "content": "Slide a cardboard backing sheet into a sealable plastic sleeve. Get a sheet of stiff cardboard or chipboard that is the same size as your print or slightly larger. Slip it into a clear plastic art sleeve with an adhesive top. [1] X Research source You can purchase plastic art sleeves online, from shipping supply stores, or from arts and crafts stores. Look for bags that are labeled “Acid Free” and “Archival Safe.” Purchase chipboard sheets from a packing supply or craft store, or cut your own backing sheets from old cardboard boxes with a precision knife. The backing sheet will help ensure that your print doesn’t get bent."
    },
    {
      "title": "Insert the print into the plastic sleeve face up.",
      "content": "Insert the print into the plastic sleeve face up. Carefully slide your print into the plastic sleeve on top of the cardboard or chipboard backing sheet. Make sure the design on the print is facing out so that it will be visible when the recipient takes it out of the package. [2] X Research source To ensure the best visibility, put your print in the bag so the adhesive seal is on the opposite side from the front of the print when you close the bag."
    },
    {
      "title": "Seal the sleeve with the print and cardboard inside.",
      "content": "Seal the sleeve with the print and cardboard inside. Peel the protective strip off of the adhesive on the plastic sleeve. Carefully fold the top of the sleeve over and press it down to seal it. [3] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Place the print inside a rigid mailing envelope.",
      "content": "Place the print inside a rigid mailing envelope. Slip the plastic sleeve containing the print into a mailer that’s stiff enough not to bend easily. Seal the top of the envelope with the adhesive strip. [6] X Research source For extra security, put a little packaging tape across the back flap of the envelope."
    },
    {
      "title": "Label the envelope “Do Not Bend”.",
      "content": "Label the envelope “Do Not Bend”. To help ensure that mail handlers take extra care with your packaged print, put a “Do Not Bend” sticker or stamp on the outside of the envelope. [7] X Research source You can also purchase envelopes that already have “Do Not Bend” printed on them."

    {
      "title": "Use tubes for large prints and posters.",
      "content": "Use tubes for large prints and posters. While flat envelopes work well for smaller prints, tubes are ideal for extra large or poster-sized prints. Look for a mailing tube that’s slightly longer than the shortest edge of your print. [8] X Research source For example, if you have a 16 by 20 in (41 by 51 cm) print, shipping in a tube will be safer and cheaper than shipping it flat. You can purchase sturdy cardboard shipping tubes from most shipping supply stores. If you’re really concerned about your print getting damaged in the mail, you can also ship it in a length of PVC pipe. [9] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Place the print on a piece of kraft paper slightly larger than the print.",
      "content": "Place the print on a piece of kraft paper slightly larger than the print. Cut out a large piece of craft paper that’s slightly longer and wider than your print. Carefully lay the print out on top of it. [10] X Research source Rolling the print up in craft paper will provide an extra layer of protection against dirt, smudges, and scratches. Alternatively, you can use an archival paper such as Tyvek or Glassine. [11] X Research source These papers are specially designed to protect delicate art and prints, but they are more expensive than basic kraft paper."

    {
      "title": "Fold the ends of the paper over the top and bottom of the print.",
      "content": "Fold the ends of the paper over the top and bottom of the print. Before you start rolling the print, fold the kraft paper up and over the 2 shorter edges of the print. This will provide some extra protection along the edges, which can easily get bent or torn during the packaging and shipping process. [12] X Research source If you’re shipping multiple prints in one tube, protect them from damaging each other by layering sheets of craft or archival paper between each print. [13] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Roll the print up carefully inside the kraft paper.",
      "content": "Roll the print up carefully inside the kraft paper. Very carefully begin to roll your print, starting from one of the short edges. Begin the roll with a gentle curve so that you don’t accidentally bend or wrinkle your print. Roll it up tightly enough so that it can slide easily into the tube, but not so tightly that you risk damaging the print. [14] X Research source If you notice any sharp folds or bends starting to form, unroll the print and start again, this time rolling more loosely. [15] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Secure the rolled-up print with stickers, tape, or twine.",
      "content": "Secure the rolled-up print with stickers, tape, or twine. Once you’re satisfied with the way you’ve rolled your print, you’ll need to secure it so it won’t start to unroll before you can get it into the tube. Place 1 or 2 stickers along the edge of the roll, use some pieces of plain or decorative tape, or tie a bit of twine around the middle of the tube. [16] X Research source You can also slip the print into a rolled poster bag if you prefer. You can purchase these bags from shipping supply stores."
    },
    {
      "title": "Tuck in the edges of the kraft paper at the ends of the roll.",
      "content": "Tuck in the edges of the kraft paper at the ends of the roll. When the print is rolled up, there should still be a small amount of kraft or archival paper sticking out at each end. Carefully tuck in the ends to help protect the edges of your print from crumpling or getting ripped. [18] X Research source Be careful not to fold or bend the edges of your print when you’re tucking in the paper."

    {
      "title": "Slide the print into a mailing tube with a cap on one end.",
      "content": "Slide the print into a mailing tube with a cap on one end. Insert a fitted plastic cap onto one end of the mailing tube, then carefully slip your print inside. Take care not to damage the end of your print when you’re sliding it in. [19] X Research source Don’t try to force the print into the tube if it doesn’t slip in easily. You’ll risk damaging the print, and it will also be harder to safely remove it from the tube if the fit is too tight. [20] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Put some wadded-up paper or other filler in the end of the tube.",
      "content": "Put some wadded-up paper or other filler in the end of the tube. Your print can become damaged if it shifts around inside the tube during shipping. To prevent this, wad up a little kraft paper, tissue paper, or bubble wrap and insert it into the end of the tube to fill up any empty space. [21] X Research source Pack the end of the tube loosely so you don’t crush the top edge of your print when you close the tube."
    },
    {
      "title": "Cap the other end of the tube and tape the caps on.",
      "content": "Cap the other end of the tube and tape the caps on. Insert the cap into the top end of the tube, then use packaging tape to secure both ends. For extra security, place several strips of tape over each end in a “star” or “asterisk” shape, then wrap a circle of tape around the end of the tube to secure the first layer of tape in place. [22] X Research source Most mailing tubes come with fitted end caps, or you can purchase caps that match your mailing tubes separately from a shipping supply store. You can also cut caps to size out of thick cardboard or chipboard. Don’t simply put tape across the open ends of the tube. Your print could stick to the tape and get damaged."
