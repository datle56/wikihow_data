      "content": "Pose 28 can be (and is often) replicated in real life. To strike the pose, stand with your legs shoulder-width apart or wider. Hold your arms behind your back so your shoulders are pulled back and your hands are close together (like you’re making the letter “V” behind your back). Finally, lean backward at an angle at the waist. The more you lean back, the more ridiculous (and funny) the pose."

The unfair practice has become a relatable meme, especially as TikTokers poke fun at how seriously they take winning the game."
