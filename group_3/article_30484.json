This will make it easier for your dog to relax under your touch. [6] X Research source Don't massage your dog when he's worked up for some reason or another; it's better to wait until he's already pretty calm. Don't massage right after an exercise session; give him a half hour or so to rest first.

As long as your dog enjoys it, there's no limit to how long you can massage him, but five or ten will give you enough time to massage his whole body thoroughly."

If you notice something alarming, take your dog to the vet to have it checked out.
