      "content": "Get a wig or style your hair. If you have long hair already, then you can just style it. If your hair is short, then you may want to get a wig to enhance your feminine look. When you are choosing a wig, make sure that you purchase one that is high quality if you want your look to be more convincing. A poor quality wig may not look as good. If you are dressing up for a drag show or play, then you can go with an over the top wig, such as something that is ultra-long, styled like a bee hive, or dyed an unnatural color. If you just want to see what it feels like to dress as a girl, then try curling your hair, using a flat iron for a pin-straight look, or braiding your hair. Long hair will help you to look feminine and it can also provide some coverage from masculine features such as a square jaw, but having long hair is not absolutely necessary if you are just dressing up to see how it feels. If you have short hair, then you can also try styling it in a feminine way. For example, you can use mousse and curl the longer pieces, or wear an accessory, such as a headband or barrette."

      "content": "Wear women’s clothing. Wearing women’s clothing is an essential part of looking like a girl. Lots of girls wear unisex clothing, such as pants, jeans, and t-shirts. However, dresses are your best bet for drag shows because they are flashier. If you just want to get a feel for what it is like to dress as a girl, then wearing a dress or a skirt with a girl’s top will give you a better idea. Choose a style that flatters you and shows off your best features. For example, you can choose a short skirt if you want to show off your legs, or a sleeveless top if you want to show off your arms. If you are going for an exaggerated look, such as for a drag show or theater production, then you might want to choose something flashy, ultra-feminine, or elaborate. For example, you could go with a sequined dress, a fluffy tulle skirt, or a hot pink evening gown. If you are interested in dressing as a girl to pass as a girl, then try to choose clothing that is in style. Wearing current trends may help make it easier for you to pass as a woman."

High heels are ultra-feminine, but they can be difficult to walk in. You will probably need to practice walking in them before you go out in public. If you are dressing up for drag or a play, then high heels may provide the most dramatic effect. Just make sure that you can walk in them without falling! If you are experimenting with women’s clothing because you want to see how it feels or possible pass as a woman in public, then try starting out with some ballet flats, some low heel dress shoes, or a fashionable pair of sandals. Make sure that your toenails are painted if you will be baring your toes."

Having visible facial hair can be a dead giveaway, so make sure that you give yourself a close shave before you start making the transformation. If you don’t want to shave your armpits, then just make sure that you are wearing something that covers them completely, such as a long-sleeve or ¾ length sleeve top. If you don’t want to shave your legs, then you can also go with some opaque tights. Wear two pairs for extra coverage. [1] X Research source"

Then, put on two pairs of form-fitting panties to help keep it in place. [2] X Research source Another option is to use a gaff. You can buy or make a gaff. To make a gaff, cut the elastic waistband off of a pair of pantyhose and then cut the top off of a sock. Thread the waistband through the sock so that the sock is centered. To use a gaff, slip your legs through the two openings in the elastic and pull it up like a pair of underwear. As you do so, tuck your penis back. Then, adjust the gaff as needed and put on your panties. The gaff will help to keep your penis tucked back."

Measure your chest around the widest part to see what size bra you will need. For example, if your chest is 38 inches around, then purchase a bra that is a size 38. The cup sizes are lettered, such as A, B, C, D, etc. A is on the smaller end while a D cup is on the larger end. You can choose any cup size you like, but keep in mind that choosing a large cup size may make it hard to fit into some clothing. To play it safe, go for a B or C cup. [3] X Research source However, if you are dressing up for a drag show or as part of a play, then you may want to go for a larger bra size. You will also need to stuff the cups . You can stuff the bra with socks, tissues, balloons filled with a few ounces of water, or special silicone bra pads."

      "content": "Practice your walk. While there is no one way to walk like a girl, you may want to practice walking in a more feminine way. Instead of taking straight, hard strides, try to walk with a bit of a sway to your hips and lightness in your step. [6] X Research source If you are just trying to experiment with what walking like a girl is like, then just aim for some slight movement in your hips as you take each step. Unless you are going for an over-the-top walk, such as for a drag show, don't place your feet directly in front of each other as this can make your walk look too exaggerated."

This seated position will help to give you a more feminine appearance. You can also fold your hands on your lap or place them gently on the table in front of you. Try not to slouch while sitting.

If you have a deep voice, then you may want to practice speaking at a higher octave. However, keep in mind that some women have deeper voices, so try not to feel self-conscious if your voice is a little deeper than some other women’s voices. If you are dressing as a woman for a drag show or play, then you can either use your normal voice or go with an over-the-top girl voice."

Unless it is part of your drag show or character, you don’t need to wear a big grin constantly or laugh all of the time. [8] X Research source If you are just trying to get a feel for more feminine mannerisms, then try to smile and laugh a little more than you usually would. If you are having trouble doing a feminine laugh, try a soft giggle instead. Make your voice a little higher, but don't make it sound like Minnie Mouse."
