      "title": "Dig around the roots.",
      "content": "Dig around the roots. Use a shovel to dig next to the stump, exposing the roots underneath the surrounding dirt. Move around the circumference of the stump and continue digging until you've exposed all of the largest roots around the tree. Dig deep on either side of the roots to expose them as much as possible. If the roots seem very large and deep, and it's difficult to completely uncover them, you might want to consider a different root removal method. The digging method works best when you're able to uncover the roots almost to their tips."

    {
      "title": "Cut up the roots.",
      "content": "Cut up the roots. Depending on the size of the roots, use loppers or a root saw to cut them into pieces. Cut them into manageable pieces and pull what you can out of the ground. Toss them into a pile as you go, clearing away as much of the root system as possible. Using an axe to cut the roots is possible, but not recommended because it can shatter dangerously if it strikes a rock, and it will usually end up stuck between roots if they are not completely exposed."

    {
      "title": "Pull out the roots.",
      "content": "Pull out the roots. Use a grub hoe to wrench the remaining embedded roots out of the ground to their very tips. If you need to make more cuts as you go, do so â€” it will make pulling them out of the ground easier. Keep going until you've removed all of the major roots, then go back and pull out anything that's left."

      "title": "Remove the stump.",
      "content": "Remove the stump. After all or most of the roots have been processed, you should be able to easily dislodge the stump. You may need to use the shovel to dig underneath the stump and cut a few more roots under it before you can get it out. Now that all the wood has been removed, you can chop it up and add it to your compost pile ."

      "title": "Fill in the hole.",
      "content": "Fill in the hole. The final step is to fill up the hole with loam or sawdust. If you fail to do so, the ground around the hole will collapse and you'll have a large dent at that spot in your yard. As the loam or sawdust settles, the ground will sink in a bit, so you may need to keep adding material to the area every few months before the ground will stay flat."

      "title": "Locate a stump grinder.",
      "content": "Locate a stump grinder. This machine grinds up stumps and their root systems to a depth of about a foot beneath the ground. Stump grinders can be rented from machine rental houses by the day. If you'd prefer not to operate the machine yourself, you can hire someone to come to your property with a stump grinder and do the job for you. You should wear gloves, goggles and ear protectors if you plan on operating the machine yourself."

      "content": "Position it over the stump and start grinding. Following the manufacturer's instructions, position the stump grinder and turn it on. It will grind the stump's surface and work its way down into the ground to grind up the roots. You'll need to move the stump grinder around the circumference of the stump in order to take care of the aerial roots as well."
