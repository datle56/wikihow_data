When these things build up in damaging levels in the liver, the body may react with reactive inflammation that leads to hepatitis, fibrosis, and cirrhosis. However, excessive alcohol use is not sufficient to promote alcoholic liver disease. Only 1 in 5 heavy drinkers develop alcoholic hepatitis, and 1 in 4 develops cirrhosis. [3] X Research source Grant BF, Dufour MC, Harford TC: Epidemiology of alcoholic liver disease. Semin Liver Dis 1988;8(1):12-25.

The chronic liver inflammation and injury from either virus can, over several decades, develop into cirrhosis. Risk factors for hepatitis B include unprotected sex, blood transfusions, and injection drug use with contaminated needles. This is a lot less prevalent in the US and other developed countries due to vaccinations. Risk factors for hepatitis C include infections from injection drug use, blood transfusions, and body piercing and tattoos.

Pressing on these nails will make the bands blanche and disappear before quickly returning. With Terry's nails, the two-thirds of the nail plate closest to the knuckle appears white. The one-third closer to the tip of the finger appears red. This is also due to inadequate albumin. Clubbing is a rounding and/or enlargement of the nailbed and the tip of the finger. When severe, the fingers may appear like drumstick, thus the term \"drumstick fingers.\" This is more commonly seen with biliary cirrhosis."

Most primary care doctors will not check for this. This is a hum in the veins that can be heard through a stethoscope in the epigastric (upper central) region of the abdomen.
