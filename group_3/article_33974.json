      "title": "Choose a path that matches your interests.",
      "content": "Choose a path that matches your interests. You'll be most likely to succeed in college if you choose a major that you find really interesting. Try taking interest assessments and skills assessments to get matched with careers that will be a good fit for you, then look at degree programs that will help you get a job in that field. You could also talk to people you know well—like your parents, mentor, or guidance counselor—about what they can see you doing. [1] X Research source Asking people for advice can be a great way to get career ideas, but don't let anyone else make the decision for you—it's your life, and it's important you choose a path that you'll be happy with. If you know that you want to go to college but you're not sure what you want to study, it's okay to enroll without declaring a major. In that case, you may want to start out at a local community or junior college to get some of your core classes out of the way while you narrow down what degree you want to pursue."

      "title": "Plan whether to live on- or off-campus.",
      "content": "Plan whether to live on- or off-campus. Living on campus will raise your tuition, so you may be able to save money by attending school close to home or by taking online classes. However, some financial aid requires you to live on-campus, and it can be cheaper to live in a dorm than to rent an apartment near the school. You'll also have access to on-campus meals if you live in a dorm, and you won't have to factor in transportation to school each day. [2] X Research source Weigh all of these factors as you're making your decision—only you'll know what's right for you."

      "title": "Practice taking care of your own needs before you leave home.",
      "content": "Practice taking care of your own needs before you leave home. If you've always lived with your parents, going away to college can be a little bit of culture shock. To help you feel more independent and prepared, get in the habit of taking care of things like your laundry, grocery shopping, and transportation on your own. [3] X Research source Other helpful skills might include cooking, checking the oil in your car, changing a flat tire, and managing your own budget. Take charge of your own schedule, too—in college, you'll be responsible for getting to class on time, and there won't be anyone there to make sure you get enough sleep at night.

      "title": "Before school starts, list everything you'll need to live comfortably.",
      "content": "Before school starts, list everything you'll need to live comfortably. Many schools will provide you with a checklist of basics to bring. In general, you'll typically need to bring bedding and pillows, towels and washcloths, a laundry basket, shower and hygiene items, clothing, and school supplies. You may also want to bring some items to help you stay organized, like shelves or under-the-bed bins, as long as they're allowed and you have space for them. In addition, consider bringing a few personal items to decorate your room, like photos of your family and friends from back home. [5] X Research source Your school will also give you a list of things that are prohibited on campus—be sure you don't bring anything that isn't allowed!"

      "title": "Apply for any aid, scholarships, or loans you'll need.",
      "content": "Apply for any aid, scholarships, or loans you'll need. If you live in the US, fill out the FAFSA (Free Application for Federal Student Aid) before you apply to college. This will let you know if you're entitled to any federal aid to help you pay for college. Also, most schools offer merit-based and need-based scholarships, so apply for those, as well. If you still need more help, look for private scholarships and grants, which you won't have to pay back. [6] X Research source Remember to include things like tuition, room and board, books, and living expenses when you're planning your budget. If you're planning to be a full-time student, you may also be able to help pay for college by working part-time. If you're only taking a few classes at a time, you might still be able to work full-time. As a last resort, consider taking out student loans to help you pay for any remaining balance—but keep in mind that you'll have to pay these back after you finish school, and student loan debt can be a heavy burden to carry with you through your adult life."

      "title": "Sign up for the basics when registration opens.",
      "content": "Sign up for the basics when registration opens. Most colleges have the same entry-level courses for freshmen, regardless of what your major is. Sign in to the school's registration website as soon as it opens to make sure you get the classes you want, then use the course catalog to choose the pre-requisites and electives that you want to take that semester. [7] X Research source For example, you might take US History, English Lit, Algebra, Art History, and Spanish your first semester. Keep in mind that college classes usually take place either Monday, Wednesday, and Friday or Tuesday and Thursday. Night classes typically only meet once a week. Try to balance your schedule so you have a few classes each day. Generally, you'll take 4-6 classes each semester if you're a full-time student. If you're a part-time student, you might take 1-3 classes, instead."

      "content": "Visit the campus bookstore to get the books you'll need. Now that you're registered for classes, it's probably starting to feel pretty real! Once you have your course list, check out which books are needed for every class. Then, head to the college bookstore to get everything you'll need. Be prepared, though—college textbooks can be kind of pricy. [8] X Research source Get to the bookstore as early as possible so you'll have the best chance of scoring used books for a big discount. To help save money, you may be able to purchase or rent used books online. If you buy online, though, make sure you get the exact edition of the textbook that your professor requires for the class. Also, order them as early as possible to ensure they'll come in before your class starts."

      "title": "Map out where each of your classes will be.",
      "content": "Map out where each of your classes will be. College campuses are usually pretty sprawled out—different departments are often housed in different buildings, not to mention dorms, administration buildings, the bookstore, and the food court. To avoid getting lost, get a map of the campus and sketch out the route you'll need to take to get to each class. [9] X Research source Also, remember that you'll probably have different classes on different days, so you'll probably need to have one map for Monday, Wednesday, and Friday and another for Tuesday and Thursday. Some schools are so big that they even have on-campus bus systems to help you get around!"

      "title": "Gather all the supplies you'll need before class starts.",
      "content": "Gather all the supplies you'll need before class starts. When you register for classes, you'll be given a syllabus, which covers everything you'll learn in the course, as well as all of the supplies you'll need. Professors expect you to come to class prepared every day, so study your syllabus carefully to be sure you have everything ready on the first day of class. [Image:Prepare for College_University Step 9 Version 3.jpg|center]] You can also find helpful information in the syllabus, like your professor's office location and hours, supplemental study materials, and grading policies. Also, use your syllabus to keep track of things like project due dates and exams."

      "title": "Start preparing for college as early as you can.",
      "content": "Start preparing for college as early as you can. If you think you'll want to go to college after you graduate, sign up for the toughest classes you think you'll be able to pass. That way, you'll be more competitive with other college applicants when the time comes. Don't take on more than you can handle—if you're great at English, you might take the most advanced English courses your school offers, but if you really struggle with math, you might only take the basics, for instance. Also, keep in touch with your guidance counselor to make sure you're taking all the classes you'll need to graduate. [10] X Research source Pay close attention in class, take careful notes , and study hard so you'll get good grades. Get involved in extracurricular activities like academic clubs, sports teams, and volunteer groups—in addition to being a lot of fun, these activities will make your college application look more impressive. To make your application really stand out, look for opportunities to earn college credit while you're still in high school. For instance, you might take Advanced Placement (AP) courses and exams, participate in an internship, or enroll in a program that allows you to take college courses part-time. [11] X Research source"

      "content": "Find out whether your top schools require the ACT or SAT. Some schools have moved away from college entrance exams, but many colleges still do require you to take one of these tests. In addition, some schools only accept scores from one test or the other. Talk to your guidance counselor about which test you should take, and when—if you're not sure where you want to go to school, you might even take both tests to be on the safe side. [12] X Research source It's usually a good idea to take both the ACT and the SAT in the Spring semester of your junior year. Then, if you want to improve your score, you'll have time to retake them in the Fall semester of your senior year. [13] X Research source These exams usually test you on information you're already learning in school, but taking a test prep class or hiring a tutor may help you improve your score. [14] X Research source If you didn't graduate from high school, you'll need to take and pass the GED (General Educational Development) test in order to be considered for college.

      "content": "Select schools that offer the program you want to study. Make a list of all of the schools you'd like to attend. Look at their entrance requirements and the programs that they offer. Also, request university brochures and visit the schools' websites to get a feel for their campus and the type of students they usually attract. From there, choose a few schools that you want to apply to. [16] X Research source Use a spreadsheet to keep all of your college info organized, like their acceptance rates, GPA requirements, and application deadlines. Plan visits to a few different schools to really get a feel for them! Try doing this the summer between your junior and senior year of high school so you'll know where you want to apply by the time senior year starts."

      "content": "Send in your transcript, application, and college essay. Talk to your school's guidance counselor about having your high school transcript sent to the colleges you're applying to—many colleges won't accept them if you just send them in yourself. Also, fill out your application and send in any supplemental information, like a college entrance essay and any required letters of recommendation. If you're going to a fine arts college, you may need to prepare a portfolio of your work, as well. [17] X Research source College applications take a lot of time to fill out, and you have to submit an application fee with each one, so think carefully as you're choosing how many schools you want to apply to. [18] X Research source Some people recommend applying to a minimum of 5 schools—3 target schools, or the schools you most want to attend, and 2 safety schools, or schools you're relatively sure you can get into. [19] X Research source Your college essay allows you to give the admissions panel a deeper glimpse into your life. Talk about struggles you've overcome or accomplishments you're especially proud of—anything that makes you stand out from the crowd. [20] X Research source"
