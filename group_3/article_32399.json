  "steps": [
    {
      "title": "Taper your nicotine use for at least 2 weeks before the test.",
      "content": "Taper your nicotine use for at least 2 weeks before the test. To pass the test, you need to get the nicotine out of your system. Because quitting cold turkey can be challenging, reduce your nicotine usage at least 2 weeks in advance. The sooner you begin tapering, the less nicotine you’ll need to worry about purging. [1] X Research source For example, if you smoke a pack a day, gradually cut back by having 1 less cigarette every day. Replacement products like gum and patches can help. Quitting is always the best option, but it’s not an easy one. Tapering at least makes withdrawal less painful."

      "title": "Stop using menthol cigarettes.",
      "content": "Stop using menthol cigarettes. Menthol affects how your body breaks down nicotine, causing it to stay in your system longer. Switch to regular cigarettes or other nicotine treatments, such as gum and patches. Try doing this while tapering in preparation for the test. [2] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Quit",
      "content": "Quit using nicotine at least 3 days before the test. Cotinine, the chemical detected by the test, stays in your system for days. Unfortunately, you can’t use any nicotine products, including patches and other replacement therapies. The sooner you quit, the better your chances on the test will be. Most nicotine can be flushed out for a urine test within 3 days. In regular and heavy smokers, cotinine may be detectable for weeks, so stop using nicotine as soon as possible."

    {
      "title": "Drink water to stay hydrated.",
      "content": "Drink water to stay hydrated. Proper hydration ensures that your body flushes out nicotine as efficiently as possible. Carry around a water bottle and use it as a replacement for other drinks, like soda or coffee. [3] X Research source Avoid overhydration. Too much water can lead to nausea, headaches, muscle cramps, and disorientation."

    {
      "title": "Sip herbal tea and cranberry juice.",
      "content": "Sip herbal tea and cranberry juice. These are both diuretics, and they’re well-known as nicotine flushers. Have some in place of anything you would normally drink. When buying a drink, read the labels to make sure these products are included. Buying a sugary drink low in actual cranberry juice won’t help you. [4] X Research source Drink ginger, dandelion, juniper, or green tea to detox for the test."
    },
    {
      "title": "Maintain a healthy and balanced diet.",
      "content": "Maintain a healthy and balanced diet. Focus your meals around small portions of lean meats and fish. Cook them in olive oil, which contains healthy fats. Pair them with food heavy in antioxidants and fiber, such as fruits, vegetables, and rice, to break down the nicotine. Foods such as eggs, onions, and garlic may stimulate your liver, leading to faster nicotine removal."

    {
      "title": "Eat plenty of green vegetables.",
      "content": "Eat plenty of green vegetables. Green vegetables are better for your body, helping it function and clear nicotine more efficiently. Broccoli and spinach, for instance, are positive options that speed up nicotine removal. You’re not restricted to eating only greens, but include a portion in your meals. [5] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Eat fruits filled with vitamin C.",
      "content": "Eat fruits filled with vitamin C. Include citrus fruits such as oranges, lemons, limes, and mangos in your diet. Vitamin C, which is also found in broccoli, is known to speed up nicotine processing. They’re also healthy foods, so they’ll help you get through the days leading up to the test. Vitamin C supplements are also very useful. Use them daily while also eating foods rich in vitamin C."

      "title": "Avoid specialty detox drinks and medicines.",
      "content": "Avoid specialty detox drinks and medicines. These are sales pitches in a bottle. They claim to help you pass the test, but there isn’t evidence that they work. Instead, rely on cheaper detox ideas like water, tea, and cranberry juice. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Exercise to increase your metabolism.",
      "content": "Exercise to increase your metabolism. It’s a healthy activity that keeps you busy when nicotine cravings hit. Even a brisk walk speeds up nicotine breakdown. Small amounts of nicotine chemicals are released every time you sweat. [7] X Research source Try playing sports, doing yoga, or finding cardio workouts online. Stay hydrated while exercising by drinking water. Signs of dehydration include a dry mouth, feeling tired, decreased urine output, headaches, and dizziness."

    {
      "title": "Avoid places where people are smoking.",
      "content": "Avoid places where people are smoking. Secondhand smoke shows up on any nicotine test. Being around smoke means more chemicals in your body, even if you are comfortable resisting the urge to smoke. Spend your time exercising and doing other relaxing activities. [8] X Research source Although secondhand smoke shows up on tests, it isn’t enough to cause a nonsmoker to fail it. You won’t be able to blame a failed test on secondhand smoke."

      "title": "Stay happy by keeping yourself busy and entertained.",
      "content": "Stay happy by keeping yourself busy and entertained. Exercise, eat healthy, and relax by rewarding yourself with activities that you love, such as getting ice cream or watching a favorite TV show. Detoxing is stressful, especially when you’re facing withdrawal. Keep your spirits up to ensure you don’t slip back into smoking before the test. [9] X Research source"

      "title": "Take a home test to monitor your nicotine levels.",
      "content": "Take a home test to monitor your nicotine levels. Home tests can be ordered online or found by walking into any drug store. They work like the real test, are government-approved, and are highly accurate. All you have to do is dip the testing strip into your urine to see whether you would pass or fail. Seeing the results can give you an example of how long nicotine hangs around in your system. Use the results to adjust your detox plans accordingly."
