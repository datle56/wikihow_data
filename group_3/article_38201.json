[1] X Research source There are multiple ways to say “I love you” in Tagalog (the Filipino language), but “Mahal kita” is the simplest, most common phrase in use today. [2] X Research source Use this phrase when speaking to partners, friends, or family (however, keep in mind that many Tagalog speakers don’t use “I love you” as casually or jokingly as many English speakers). “Mahal” is pronounced as “mah-hall” and “kita” is pronounced as “kee-tah.” Variations of “Mahal kita” include: “Mahal na mahal kita” (“I love you very much”) [3] X Research source “Mahal kita talaga” (“I really love you”) “Mahal kita magpakailanman” (“I love you forever”) “Lab kita!” (Taglish for “Luv ya!”) [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Use “Iniibig kita” for a more poetic way to say “I love you” romantically. [5] X Research source “Iniibig” comes from the verb “ibigin,” which means “to love someone romantically.” Therefore, use “iniibig kita” when speaking to your spouse or partner, and not to express friendly or familial love. [6] X Research source “Iniibig” is a 4-syllable word pronounced as “ee-nee-ee-beeg.” This phrase is considered more dramatic than “Mahal kita” and is used sparingly.<ref. https://www.tagaloglang.com/i-love-you-in-tagalog/ </ref> You may see or hear it in romantic novels, movies, or TV shows more than in casual conversation."

      "title": "Practice Tagalog vowel pronunciation to sound out words phonetically.",
      "content": "Practice Tagalog vowel pronunciation to sound out words phonetically. Unlike in English, there’s only one way to pronounce each vowel in Tagalog. This makes it much easier to sound out and pronounce new words syllable-by-syllable. Keep in mind that when two vowels occur next to each other (like in the word “iniibig”), each vowel is pronounced separately rather than combining to form a new sound (so “iniibig” would sound like “ee-nee-ee-beeg”). [12] X Research source Here’s a breakdown of vowel pronunciation: A is pronounced as a straight “ah” sound (like in “father” or “mall”). E is pronounced as soft “eh” sound (like in “dress” or “echo”). I is pronounced as hard “ee” sound (like in the “e” in “evil” or the “y” in “happy”). O is pronounced as a straight and soft “oh” sound (like in “hello” or “rose”). U is pronounced as hard “oo” sound (like in “spoon” or “goose”)."
