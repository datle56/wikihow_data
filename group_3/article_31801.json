    {
      "title": "They’re naturally curious and insightful.",
      "content": "They’re naturally curious and insightful. Ophiuchans are seekers of knowledge. [1] X Research source Like the Roman hero Asclepius, who discovered the secret of immortality and who is associated with the constellation, people ruled by Ophiuchus tend to be insatiably curious. They’ve always got another question, and they’re always ready to get their hands dirty to find an answer. Because they’re so inquisitive, Ophiuchans are also pretty insightful! They don’t just gather information; they think on it and spend a lot of time trying to figure out what it means."
    },
    {
      "title": "They seek out change and avoid routine.",
      "content": "They seek out change and avoid routine. Ophiuchans are prone to boredom and have a hard time keeping still for too long. But luckily, they’re also skilled at finding their next adventure, so boredom never overstays its welcome. Also, any sort of routine quickly starts to grate—Ophiuchans feel the urge to constantly switch things up, just to keep their lives interesting. This means that many other signs tend to have a hard time keeping up with Ophiuchans."
    },
    {
      "title": "Ophiuchans are extremely honest.",
      "content": "Ophiuchans are extremely honest. They’ve got no time for mincing words or dancing around a tricky subject. When an Ophiuchan has something to say, they say it. [2] X Trustworthy Source Science Direct Online archive of peer-reviewed research on scientific, technical and medical topics Go to source They wear their emotions on their sleeves, and have little patience for people who try too hard to be overly polite, or who let themselves get emotionally stepped on. This trait probably comes from their astrological neighbors, Scorpios and Sagittarians, whose star signs overlap with Ophiuchus. Ophiuchans can sometimes be a little too blunt or straightforward. Their tendency to speak their minds sometimes leads to hurt feelings."

    {
      "title": "They’re great at smoothing over arguments or hurt feelings.",
      "content": "They’re great at smoothing over arguments or hurt feelings. The constellation is often associated with doctors or healers. [3] X Trustworthy Source HelpGuide Nonprofit organization dedicated to providing free, evidence-based mental health and wellness resources. Go to source That’s probably why Ophiuchans are known to be adept healers themselves—not necessarily physicians, but rather healers of the emotional sort. They’ll always lend an ear or a shoulder to cry on, and know how to handle conflict , with themselves or with others. Since Ophiuchans are also naturally insightful, they also have a knack for avoiding conflict themselves—they usually know how to read people, and which buttons not to push."
    },
    {
      "title": "Ophiuchans are naturally seductive.",
      "content": "Ophiuchans are naturally seductive. Snakes are often seen as tempters—think the classic episode in the Garden of Eden. Ophiuchans are basically defined by snakes, and so they tend to be effortlessly flirty and alluring. [4] X Research source Their ability to read people makes navigating the dating pool somewhat easier for them, and if they want a relationship, they know how to get one. Ophiuchans might struggle with monogamy, since they’re such natural flirts, and also crave adventure. Often, they thrive in polyamorous relationships , where they can experiment and explore."
    },
    {
      "title": "They’re incredibly passionate about life and love.",
      "content": "They’re incredibly passionate about life and love. When an Ophiuchan sets their mind to something, they go at it with their entire being. They have an unmatched zest for life. [5] X Research source That might be thanks to the Roman hero associated with the sign, Asclepius, who pursued immortality. Like him, an Ophiuchan wants to take full advantage of their life and make a name for themself while they can. This passion also translates to platonic and romantic relationships. Ophiuchans want to make the most of their time spent with others."
    },
    {
      "title": "They have a great sense of spirituality and philosophy.",
      "content": "They have a great sense of spirituality and philosophy. Like their sister sign, Sagittarius, Ophiuchans think with their hearts and their instincts. [6] X Research source This means they tend to be more spiritual and philosophical than others, as they’re constantly looking inside themselves to figure out what they feel and what they think about the world around them. This also makes Ophiuchans skilled artists, since they’re always trying to express what they find within themselves."
    },
    {
      "title": "They can sometimes be jealous or judgemental.",
      "content": "They can sometimes be jealous or judgemental. Ophiuchans think with their hearts, and sometimes that means they have trouble empathizing with other people, and can be a little judgmental as a result. [7] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source That said, it’s only a matter of time before their honesty and insight kick in, and they’re quick to revise that judgment if they’re proven wrong. Since Ophiuchans are also so passionate, they can be petty or vengeful when someone wrongs them."
    },
    {
      "title": "Ophiuchans are socially magnetic.",
      "content": "Ophiuchans are socially magnetic. Their zodiac neighbors are Scorpios, who are cool and aloof, and Sagittarians , the friendliest people at the party. Ophiuchans sit right in the middle: enigmatic while also being charismatic. [8] X Research source These 2 traits together are a recipe for being the center of attention. Ophiuchans are often the life of the party, wherever they go. Sometimes, being the center of attention can be a bit overwhelming for an Ophiuchan, though, and they’ll probably need some time alone every now and then to recharge."

      "title": "They tend to be lighthearted and fun.",
      "content": "They tend to be lighthearted and fun. More than anything, Ophiuchans are just plain fun to be around. [9] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Medical School Harvard Medical School's Educational Site for the Public Go to source Their natural curiosity, craving for adventure, honesty, ability to smooth over arguments, and passionate nature all combine to make them buoyant and uplifting people. Everyone wants an Ophiuchan in their corner."

      "title": "Ophiuchus is compatible with Pisces, Aries, Cancer, Scorpio, and Sagittarius.",
      "content": "Ophiuchus is compatible with Pisces, Aries, Cancer, Scorpio, and Sagittarius. A Pisces has the energy and stamina to keep up best with an Ophiuchus. Aries and Cancers, too, tend to be able to match Ophiuchans’ sense of adventure, as well as their ability to smooth over conflicts. Then, Scorpios and Sagittariuses, Ophiuchans’ zodiac neighbors, naturally make companions to the 13th star sign."

      "title": "Ophiuchus has neutral compatibility with Gemini and Libra.",
      "content": "Ophiuchus has neutral compatibility with Gemini and Libra. These signs can go either way when paired with the 13th zodiac. Like Ophiuchans, Geminis are charismatic and good talkers. [10] X Research source When they meet up, the two will either hit it off or just play it cool, but probably won’t swing too hard in either direction. Libras are creative like Ophiuchans, and so they’ll either be great collaborators, or butt heads over artistic decisions."

    {
      "title": "Ophiuchus is incompatible with Taurus, Virgo, Aquarius, and Leo.",
      "content": "Ophiuchus is incompatible with Taurus, Virgo, Aquarius, and Leo. Ophiuchans’ free spirits don’t match well with stubborn temperaments, which makes Tauruses a hard sell for the serpent bearers. Virgos are a coin toss, since they’re similarly creative. [11] X Research source But a Virgo’s type-A personality tends not to mesh with an Ophiuchan’s need to constantly mix things up. Then both Aquarius and Leo are often a bit too similar to Ophiuchus—big personalities that feel very deeply—and there’s often only room for one of the three in a group. Reader Poll: We asked 654 wikiHow readers if they think Taureans are generally controlling and stubborn, and 70% of them said yes . [Take Poll]"

      "content": "Ophiuchus (oaf-ee-YOU-kus) is the 13th astrological sign. The Ophiuchus constellation isn’t anything new, but some astrologers began to acknowledge it around 2011. [12] X Research source When the zodiac was first conceived by the Babylonians about 3,000 years ago, the Earth’s axis had a slightly different tilt, and so Ophiuchus was obscured in the night sky. Nowadays, though, the Earth’s tilt has shifted, and Ophiuchus is a more obvious presence, hence the new astrological development. [13] X Research source Zodiac signs are determined by observing the constellation that currently backdrops the sun if you were to observe it in the sky. Nowadays, we look up and see a slightly different set of constellations behind the sun than people 3,000 years ago. Many astrologers still stick to the 12 established zodiac signs, saying that ancient astrologers knew of Ophiuchus, but it just wasn’t selected as 1 of the 12—after all, there are many constellations, but not all of them are zodiac signs!"

      "content": "Ophiuchus rules people born from November 29–December 17. Thanks to the “new” zodiac sign, some say that your rising, or primary, zodiac sign may have shifted. For those who accept Ophiuchus as a new fixture in the astrological chart, the 12 “sections” of the zodiac are now divided up into 13, with Ophiuchus ruling anyone born from November 29 to December 17. [14] X Research source Take a moment to double-check your own chart ; you might have a new rising! Sagittarius: Dec 17 – Jan 20 Capricorn: Jan 20 - Feb 16 Aquarius: Feb 16 – March 11 Pisces: March 11 – April 18 Aries: April 18 – May 13 Taurus: May 13 – June 21 Gemini: June 21 – July 20 Cancer: July 20 – Aug 10 Leo: Aug 10 – Sept 16 Virgo: Sept 16 – Oct 30 Libra: Oct 30 – Nov 23 Scorpio: Nov 23 – Nov 29 Ophiuchus: Nov 29 – Dec 17"

      "content": "Ophiuchus is known as the “serpent bearer.” The constellation depicts a man holding a snake, which coils around his waist. [15] X Research source It was first recorded by the Greek astronomer Ptolemy in the 2nd century. To the Romans, the constellation was associated with the figure Asclepius, who discovered the secret of immortality by watching one serpent heal another, after which Asclepius was killed by Zeus for knowing too much. The Babylonians, who conceived the zodiac, associated the constellation with Nirah, a god with the torso of a human and the body of a snake. [16] X Research source"
