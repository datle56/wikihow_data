      "content": "Select lining fabric that matches the style and purpose of your bag. For example, if you're lining a market bag or tote, pick a sturdy cotton fabric or blend that can withstand a lot of use. To line a small clutch or purse, you might use a rayon or polyester blend fabric, since these are soft and shiny. [1] X Research source Decide if you'd like the liner color to really stand out against your bag or if you'd like a liner that blends into the fabric of your bag. Cotton and synthetic acrylic are both good options. [2] X Expert Source Alessio Iadicicco Apparel Manufacturing Specialist Expert Interview. 16 June 2021. You can also use a light eco-leather.

      "content": "Stack the pieces and pin around the edges. Arrange the pieces so the edges line up perfectly. If you're making a large liner, pin every 3 inches (7.6 cm) along the edges to hold them in place. To make a small liner, just pin the corners. [5] X Research source If you're using a patterned fabric, stack the pieces so the right sides are facing in and sew the wrong side of the fabric."

Use your sewing machine to straight stitch down each of the sides and along the bottom, leaving a 1 ⁄ 8 inch (0.32 cm) seam allowance. [6] X Research source If you used pins along the sides, remove them as you stitch so you don't sew over them."

      "content": "Leave a 3 to 4 in (7.6 to 10.2 cm) gap if you're doing the turned-out method. If you'll be sewing the liner onto the bag and pulling the bag out, it's important to leave a space for getting your hand down into the bag. To do this, leave a gap in the center of the bottom edge of your liner. [7] X Research source Feel free to make a larger gap if you have large hands."

      "content": "Choose the drop-in liner method if you have a bag made of stiff material. If you'd like to line a bag that holds its shape, plan on pushing the liner in and sewing the edges. Although you can use drop-in liners on many bags, they're especially great for rigid bags made of fabric that doesn't bend easily. [8] X Research source For example, use the drop-in liner for woven tote bags or clutch bags made from stiff material."

      "content": "Fold the top of your bag over by 3 ⁄ 8 inch (0.95 cm) and iron it. Keep the bag that you are lining right side out and fold the top edge in towards the middle of the bag. Make the fold 3 ⁄ 8 inch (0.95 cm) wide to give you a seam allowance. Then, iron across the folded line so the fabric stays in place. [9] X Research source The right side of the bag is the patterned side. Turn your iron to the setting that's recommended for the type of fabric you're working with. For example, if you're ironing a cotton bag, use a hot iron."

Then, fold the top of the liner in towards the wrong side by 3 ⁄ 8 inch (0.95 cm). Iron along the folded fabric so the crease holds its shape. [10] X Research source If you're using a liner that has a pattern, the pattern should face the inside once you've turned the liner wrong side out."

      "content": "Pin the liner and bag to keep the fabrics in place. Once you've arranged the fabrics so the seams match, push a sewing pin horizontally through them to keep the materials from sliding around. If you don't want to use pins, use small fabric clips to hold the liner and bag in place. [12] X Research source If you're sewing the handles between the liner and bag, push them into place and pin them as well. To sew a large bag, you can also pin every 4 inches (10 cm) around the sides of the bag to keep the liner from slipping down."

      "content": "Use a turned-out liner for a flexible bag. Since turned-out liners don't need to be as exact as drop-in liners, they're great for beginner sewers. The turned-out lining method works best for bags that don't have to hold their shape perfectly. This allows you to bend, scrunch, and adjust the bag and lining fabric. [14] X Research source For example, use a turned-out liner for market bags, soft totes, or flexible purses."
