      "content": "Manifestation is the act of making your desires appear in real life. It’s sometimes called the Law of Attraction—you get very clear and specific on what you want, and then you clear away any negative, self-limiting thoughts and take action to “attract” it. You can manifest anything from love to good grades to money to a new job. All you need is optimism and a clear plan to manifest your goals! [1] X Research source Manifestation requires deep introspection, often through meditation or journaling, to figure out what you really want in life. It frequently involves visualization—the practice of seeing and feeling what you want in the future to inspire you to work towards it today. Taking tangible action towards your goal is crucial. Without a plan and some effort, it’s unlikely that your desire will manifest itself to you."

      "title": "Get clear and specific about what type of work you really want to do.",
      "content": "Get clear and specific about what type of work you really want to do. Consider the industry you want to work in, what roles you enjoy, who your coworkers will be, how long your commute is—everything! Focus on what you definitely do want, not just what might be fun or what you don’t want. Choose what makes you excited to get out of bed (not just what makes you the most money). A clear goal could be “I want to run my own hot dog cart in Times Square by next summer” or “I'll be a VP at a major retail company by my 35th birthday.” Make sure to pick the job you truly want and that you’ve chosen it because it fits your interests, talents, or passions. Look for signs that you’re focused on the right work. For example, you may keep seeing ads seeking bartenders once you’ve decided to be a mixologist. When your goal is super clear and specific, you’ll have an easier time figuring out what you can do to make it happen. Brainstorm answers to questions like: [2] X Research source What are my talents? What do I want to share with the world? Do I want to be employed, or do I want to employ myself? How important is money? What would I do if money wasn’t a factor?"

      "content": "Let go of the self-limiting beliefs holding you back. Negative thoughts caused by fear become real if you dwell on them. For example, you’re less likely to apply for a job if you truly believe you’re unqualified or too lazy to do it. Address these thoughts when they come up to build your confidence and inspire action. Reverse limiting thoughts as they come up. Instead of “I don’t deserve a new job,” tell yourself that you do deserve a new job that makes you happy! Reframe intrusive thoughts. Instead of “I hate job searching, this is the worst,” think “I had no idea there were so many jobs, I’m bound to find one!” Say positive affirmations daily. Try things like “I deserve a fulfilling career,” “I’m qualified for the work I want,” or “I have opportunities for change.” [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Visualize yourself working your dream job in great detail. Repeatedly imagine what the job looks like, where it’s located, who your coworkers are, and what your daily routine looks like. Let yourself feel what it’s like to get that offer letter and imagine yourself living in that reality. [4] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Business Review Online and print journal covering topics related to business management practices Go to source The more specific your manifestation is, the better! Try writing all of the details of your dream job down in a journal, or creating a vision board to look at and center yourself with everyday. Take time to meditate on the image of yourself at your new job. It’s also a great way to reflect on how far you’ve come toward reaching your goal. Try scripting . Write a letter to yourself from the future and describe how you got your new job, what you’ve learned, and how you feel.

      "content": "Make a plan for your job search. Plans keep you accountable and give you a roadmap to follow. Set aside time to work on your plan (don’t just think about it!)—think backward from your future job and figure out what you need to do to get there. [6] X Research source Write your plans and ideas on paper—by creating something physical, you’re already taking action towards success. [7] X Research source Brainstorm every possible thing you might need to do. These things can range from simply polishing your resume to moving to a new city. Create mini-goals to act as stepping stones. These could be things like “Send out 10 applications per month” or “Attend one networking event per week.” Make if-then backup plans. For example, \"If there are no jobs I love in my town, then I'll seek remote work instead.\""

      "content": "Stick to your plan and be proactive. You know what you want and how to get it, so make it happen! Maybe you need to take classes or get training for new skills, or expand your social and professional network . Most importantly, look at those job listings and fire off resumes! Remember, you’re ultimately responsible for your outcomes (even if the universe helps). The effort you put into your search directly impacts your result. Do everything with the intent of fulfilling your goal. Surround yourself with the resources and inspiration you need to find what you’re looking for. Try new things to stay open to new possibilities. Job opportunities can appear in ads, through friends and contacts, on social media, or in shop windows."

      "content": "Have gratitude for what you have now—even if it’s a job you don’t love. Challenge yourself to be thankful for having employment and learning skills to take to the next job. As you search, be grateful for each interview, connection, piece of knowledge, or new possibility you discover. Focus on what you have and what you’re gaining instead of what you don’t have to achieve an abundance mindset. [8] X Research source Keep a gratitude journal. Jot down one thing you’re grateful for each day, especially if it’s job-related. Even if you’re currently unemployed, thank the universe for the many possible job opportunities that lay in front of you. Expand your gratitude to non-work aspects of your life too. Acknowledging the good in your life keeps you positive, which brings your new job even closer."

      "title": "Stay positive and trust the process.",
      "content": "Stay positive and trust the process. Positivity is key to attracting what you want—a positive mindset makes you a productive, creative problem solver who makes inspired choices. When you feel positive, you make others feel good too (helpful for acing an interview!). You’ll attract the people and opportunities that will help you find your next job—just be patient. When you're caught up in timing, you cut yourself off from new possibilities. Let go of lingering doubts about manifestation. The process works when you believe that the universe is on your side and good things are coming to you. Just think of this way—you have already manifested everything that you currently have in your life. Don’t worry about what others think. Many people never act on great career ideas because they’re self-conscious. Focus on what you want for your life. Write a letter of resignation for your current job and save it for when you leave. It’ll keep you upbeat and inspired (and save you time once you get an offer)."
