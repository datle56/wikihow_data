Continue blotting the carpet with a fresh paper towel until you no longer see any juice transferring to the paper. [1] X Research source You can use a cloth or rag to blot the juice, but make sure that it's white. Dyes from colored fabric can transfer to the carpet. If a large amount of juice has spilled, you may want to soak up the excess with a wet vacuum before blotting the stain."

      "content": "Spray the area with water. After you've blotted the juice from the surface of the carpet, it's important to remove any liquid that may have seeped into the fibers. Fill a spray bottle with water, and lightly mist the stained area to moisten it again. [2] X Research source Use bottled or distilled water to spray the area to avoid any additional staining."

Continue wetting the sponge, applying it to the stain, and blotting away the excess liquid until the spot is removed. [6] X Research source Depending on the type of juice and how long the stain has set, it may take three or more applications of the detergent solution to remove it completely."

      "content": "Mix ammonia with water. If the stain doesn't lift when you use the detergent, you may need to use a stronger solution. Combine 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of ammonia with 2 cups (473 ml) of warm water and mix to ensure that they're fully incorporated. [9] X Research source As an alternative, mix 1 ⁄ 2 cup (120 mL) of white vinegar into 2 ⁄ 3 cup (160 mL) of water. Put the solution into a clean spray bottle, then spritz it onto your stain. Do not use an ammonia mixture on your carpet if it is wool or a wool-blend. If you're not sure what type of fiber your carpet is, check with the manufacturer. Mixing ammonia and chlorine bleach will create hazardous fumes, so make sure that the detergent you used on the carpet did not contain bleach before applying the ammonia."
