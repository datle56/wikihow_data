      "content": "The Romantic body type is an hourglass shape with petite and rounded features. The Romantic is one of the 13 body types defined by David Kibbe. According to Kibbe body types, each person’s shape falls on a spectrum from yin (softer and more delicate) to yang (sharper and more angular). [1] X Research source The Romantic type is the most yin of all the body types and is largely seen as the most stereotypically feminine or “bombshell” shape. Romantics have a small bone structure with full breasts, defined waists, and rounded shoulders and hips—this hourglass-like proportion stays consistent regardless of weight changes. Celebrity examples of pure Romantics include Beyoncé, Marilyn Monroe, Elizabeth Taylor, Madonna, Drew Barrymore, Helena Bonham Carter, Emilia Clarke, Christina Ricci, Elvis Presley, Leonardo DiCaprio, and Zac Efron. [2] X Research source Theatrical Romantics are a subset of Romantics, but they have a slight yang undercurrent and sharper features in some areas where Romantics have only softness. [3] X Research source Romantics are also sometimes confused with Soft Naturals, who have broader, thicker, and more angular bone structures than Romantics."

      "title": "Overall Shape & Dressing Lines",
      "content": "Overall Shape & Dressing Lines When putting together an outfit, choose soft and round lines throughout your look. [8] X Research source Opt for clothing items that are both fitted and flowy—like a drapey dress with a well-defined waist. Round necklines are best, and ornate details like ruffles or ruching can add a touch of softness to your look. In general, you want to highlight your hourglass shape as a Romantic (which is why waist definition is so important). Keep that goal in mind whenever you’re picking out clothing options and putting together outfits. To enhance the hourglass shape, Hewlett recommends wearing “lots of form-fitting styles and accentuating the shoulders and waist…to give yourself a more exaggerated curve.” However, you may feel more comfortable choosing one part of your body to accentuate, adds Santelli. Ask yourself, “'What curves do you want to highlight?' Then highlight that and be conservative everywhere else.” “Every woman has a part of their body, curves-wise, that they love,” continues Santelli. “Whether you have…a great butt or you have a nice chest, stick with whatever you feel comfortable or confident in” and highlight that.”"

      "content": "Wear your hair in soft and timeless styles. One of the go-to hair looks for Romantics is a waterfall of soft, large curls throughout the hair. However, any look that’s sophisticated and classic will look good with your Romantic type, including a low-bun updo with wispy face-framing layers. Keep your hair color natural or blend soft highlights into your natural hue. [18] X Research source Medium-length hair is often recommended for Romantics, but you can really wear your hair at whatever length that you like best. Keep in mind that not all of these hairstyles will look good on every Romantic person. Faces have a lot of variety, and each suits its own style."

      "content": "Accentuate your lips and wear soft, smokey face makeup. Wear a shiny lipstick, lip gloss, or bold lip stain to show off your full lips (Hewlett recommends a glamorous red lip). Wear soft and blurry eyeshadow in light colors like champagne, pink, and warm brown—for a more glam look, do a smokey eye with soft and shimmery colors. Like hairstyles, a lot of other factors go into the makeup looks that work for your face. Some people feel comfortable in bolder styles, while others may feel their best in softer looks.
