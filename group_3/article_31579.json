You’ll need your key to open your garage door from the outside. [1] X Research source The emergency release lock typically sits flush with your garage door, as it’s meant to blend in. It will almost always be dead-center and near the top of your garage door. If you don’t have your key, you can still open your garage door from the inside. However, you do need your emergency release key to open your garage door from the outside."

Grab the same key you just used and find the lock in the center of your garage door above the handle. Turn the key in the lock and twist the handle counter-clockwise at the same time so that it’s vertical. [3] X Research source You can either pull the key out now and store it for safe-keeping, or you can leave it in the manual lock to use once you’re safely inside the garage."

Your automatic door opener is the only thing up there with a power cable attached to it. Reach up and unplug the garage door opener before you start to open the garage door without power. [6] X Research source Even though the power is out now, it could come back on later. Unplugging the door opener saves you from damaging the assembly and having to do a tough re-installation later on."
