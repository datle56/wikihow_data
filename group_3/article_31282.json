For an instant boost to your bust line, simply straighten up! Stand up straight, hold your head high, and draw your shoulders back. Keep your neck straight up-and-down; don't let it slide forward. Push your chest out gently as you stand and walk. Now, take a look in the mirror. You may be surprised what a difference this simple trick has made!"

      "content": "Wear tops with embellishments over the chest. One often-ignored way to make your breasts appear bigger is simply by wearing clothing that accentuates your natural curves. For instance, any sort of shirt with puffy, frilly, or ruffled material in the chest area can give the illusion that your breasts are larger than they actually are. The same effect can be achieved with well-worn scarves. Another good bet is to wear shirts with horizontal-striped patterns on the chest. For the same reason that people worried about their weight like to avoid wearing these types of clothing, people looking to enhance the size of their chest may want to use these volume-adding patterns."

Make sure you don't wear a big bra just to make your breast bigger, but wear a bra that gives you support and comfort.

Ideally, bras should support and lift the breasts, not flatten them or allow them to hang loosely. If you think that you may be wearing the wrong bra size, ask for a fitting the next time you go lingerie shopping. Some people who spend years using one size of bra find that after a re-fitting they look (and feel) measurably better."

      "content": "Use a padded or push-up bra. A good padded bra can add noticeable volume to your bust while also making your breasts look perkier. Push-up bras, on the other hand, can add lots of \"lift\" to your breasts, giving the appearance of a larger, fuller bust. Using these types of bras is a great quick-fix for outfits that go from looking good to great with a slightly larger chest. Though some sources may recommend it, in general, it's a bad idea to wear multiple bras, regardless of the type of bras being used. Though this can make your breasts look a little bigger if it's applied to correctly, it can be awfully uncomfortable and will probably have you spending lots of time adjusting yourself throughout the day.

These bras may look tremendous on lingerie store mannequins, but on real people, they can prove unflattering. Because they can provide little in the way of padding or lift, these types of bras can leave your bust size lacking. Instead, opt for a padded bra or a push-up bra to make the most of your natural size. If your bra is constantly riding up in the back or the straps are falling off the shoulder, you likely need to size down on the band, while at the same time staying at the same cup size or going up one cup size. [3] X Expert Source Katie Quinn Image Consultant Expert Interview. 14 April 2020. You'll also want to avoid extra-tight bras like sports bras (unless of course, you're exercising), as they tend to flatten your chest rather than accentuating it. This is great if you're looking to have a hassle-free work out, but not so good if you're trying to maximize your curves."

Using tissue or cloth to artificially add size to your breasts can be quite uncomfortable, especially if this extra material causes you to sweat or irritates your skin. If your extra padding shifts, it can even give your breasts an uneven or lumpy appearance. Also, there's always the chance that, despite your best preparations, your padding falls out or slides up your chest and becomes visible. Because of this, you'll want to avoid stuffing your bra unless you feel that you positively have to."

Before attempting to use any of these methods, contact a doctor to discuss more effective, verifiable ways to achieve your breast enlargement goals.

Sometimes, these sources recommend the use of special oils, creams, or gadgets to encourage growth. Though this may feel good and lead to relaxation, which can cause an improvement in mood and posture, there is no scientific evidence that breasts can be stimulated to grow via massage. However, because this method is relatively safe and inexpensive (unless you buy a massage aid available for sale from naturopathic healing stores), feel free to attempt it at will.

In general, when strength training, you'll want to ensure that you exercise all of your major muscle groups each week to ensure maximum total-body strength and prevent injury. In addition, toning muscle groups besides those in your chest can also have positive effects on your bust size. For instance, strengthening your shoulder and back muscles can give your upper body a toned, firm appearance and make it easier to maintain pert, erect posture. Both of these can make your breasts appear bigger and more shapely. Get started working your back and shoulders with the sample exercises below: Y Raise: Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart. Hold one dumbbell with each hand in front of each thigh. In a smooth, controlled movement, raise the dumbbells out in front of you and over your head into a \"Y\" shape. Keep your core firm and maintain an erect posture as you do this. Complete the exercise by lowering the weights back into their starting position slowly. Do 3 sets of 15-20 reps 3-5 times per week. Renegade Row: Grab two dumbbells and get into push-up position with straight arms. Keeping your hips stationary, pull one dumbbell from the floor up to your chest, keeping your elbow tucked against your body. Lower the dumbbell back to the ground and repeat with the opposite arm.

In fact, it's almost impossible for women to get big, burly muscles without becoming professional body builders or using steroids. Females don't naturally produce as much of the hormone testosterone as males, making it much more difficult for them to naturally put on big muscles. While women are perfectly capable of becoming stronger and more toned, they generally have to have the schedules of professional athletes (or use steroids) to even begin to appear muscly in a masculine way."

However, you'll want to avoid an all-out weight-gaining binge, as the negative effects of rapid weight gain and obesity are numerous. [11] X Research source Your best bet is to increase your calorie intake moderately for a week or two, then judge your results. If you don't like any changes you see, return to your previous diet. However, it's important to note that all women carry their weight differently. Some women gain weight in their thighs, belly, or elsewhere before gaining weight in their chest. It is important to follow a healthy diet even if you are trying to gain weight. Increase your intake of lean proteins, healthy fats, and complex carbohydrates, rather than foods rich in unhealthy fats and sugars. In addition, always remember to stay active — the Centers for Disease Control recommend about 2 hours and 30 minutes of aerobic exercise per week along with at least two sessions of strength-training.

[13] X Research source This concept has been repeatedly debunked by scientific research. So, if you're trying to get bigger breasts, don't waste time trying to spot-reduce in other areas of your body. It just won't work! While you can't selectively gain or lose fat by targeting certain areas of the body, you can selectively build muscle by targeting certain areas with strength training exercises.

For women who want to prevent an unplanned pregnancy and, coincidentally, also desire larger breasts, birth control pills can be an effective solution for both problems, as breast growth is a common side-effect of many hormone-based birth control pills. Most birth control pills contain the female sex hormone estrogen, which, as discussed below, can cause slight breast growth. However, you should never take birth control just to get bigger breasts, as it's a powerful medication that can have serious side effects (though these are rare). Because not all birth control pills contain estrogen and because birth controls that do contain this hormone can have a variety of other effects on the body, it's important to talk with your doctor before beginning to take birth control. The side effects of birth control can include: Mood swings Nausea Headaches Decreased libido Weight gain Unexpected bleeding (or spotting). Note that not all women get bigger breasts while taking birth control and that any growth that does occur may be minor."
