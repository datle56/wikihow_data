These flush bolt floor keepers are typically located on the bottom of the door in the center and prevent them from swinging at 15- to 30-degree angles. If your closet door has one, you need to remove it before you can put your door back on the track. Floor keepers are typically fastened to sliding doors by two screws."

Dirt buildup can make it difficult to put your door back on the track, and make it easier to become unhinged.

Dab the towel with 2 to 3 drops of your choice of lubricant and gently rub the tracks until its shiny. You can also use a grease gun for even easier application.

      "content": "Adjust the roller height if the door is rubbing against the floor. If you just had new flooring installed, it's possible that your door came unhinged from the track due to friction. If this is the case, adjust the knobs or screws on the door's roller by turning them to the right to move the roller height upwards. Turning to the left moves the roller height downwards, but if the door is hitting the floor, you will likely need to move it up. [4] X Research source Keep adjusting the door's roller height until there's enough space between the door and track that it can glide across it uninterrupted."

If you notice the track is uneven with the floor, place a block of wood into the left or right side of the track parallel to the its direction. Afterwards, place another block of wood onto the track perpendicular to the first block, and use a hammer to hit the top of the second piece of wood. Continue hammering until the track is straight. [5] X Research source A standard hammer or rubber mallet works best."

If it's set to raised and still getting stuck, you need to replace the roller. Rollers can be purchased for $5 to $10 each at hardware stores."

Angle the door at 15 to 30 degrees as you push it upwards. At this point, the rollers should be directly above the top track, but not hooked onto it properly. Straighten the door by pushing the bottom part forward until it's no longer at an angle to your body, and pull the door downward. Make sure that the top roller properly hinges itself onto the top track, and the bottom fits into the bottom track. [10] X Research source Pushing the door upward into the top track gives the door enough space to fit into the bottom track. Remember to make sure that the top rollers are directly above the top track's hinge when pulling the door downward. Successfully attaching your door requires you to do this while at the same time angling the door so that the bottom of the door fits into the bottom track.

Afterwards, lift the door slightly, and then drop the lower pin into the lower bracket slot. Verify that there is at least 1 ⁄ 4 inch (0.64 cm) clearance between the pivot door and the jam (the vertical part of the door frame that the door attaches to). [12] X Research source For horizontal adjustment on the top track, begin by loosening the screw in the top pivot bracket. Then, move the door toward or away from the jam until there is 1 ⁄ 4 inch (0.64 cm) clearance, and then retighten the screw. For horizontal adjustment on the bottom track, lift the door from the bottom and move the adjusting wheel toward or away from the jam until the doors are plumb with the jam. Lower the door back into the bracket when you're done. For vertical adjustment, lift the door slightly until the adjustment wheel clears the slot in the lower bracket. Rotate the adjustment wheel to the left to raise the door, and to the right to lower it. When you're done, gently lower the teeth of the adjustment wheel into the bracket and be sure to lock it firmly in place."
