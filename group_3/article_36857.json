There should be a triangle icon or a red dot next to Pin 1 (it's usually the one on the bottom right). Pins 1, 2, 3, and 4 are all on the same side. Pin 5 is directly across from Pin 4 and Pin 6 is right next to Pin 5. Place a paperclip or short piece of wire on Pins 1 and 6 and hold it steady (be sure to touch something metal before touching the inside of a motherboard.) Have another person power the computer on. Remove the paperclip or wire when you hear it beep. This should force your computer to boot into the backup BIOS."
