      "content": "Decide what type of grout you will be using. This is dependent on the size of your grout's joint (the space between the tiles where the grout lies). There are two types of grout for regrouting tile: sanded and unsanded. [1] X Research source If your grout joints are larger than 1/8 inch (.3175 cm) use sanded grout to fill in the space; if your joints are going to be less than 1/8 inch (.3175 cm) use non sanded grout to fill in your joints as it is more compact. A good rule of thumb is to use unsanded grout if your grout lines are 1 ⁄ 8 in (0.32 cm) or less, because it's better for getting into smaller spaces. Use sanded grout for grout lines wider than 1 ⁄ 8 in (0.32 cm), because the sand will provide some reinforcement. [2] X Expert Source Art Fricke Home Renovation & Repair Specialist Expert Interview. 1 July 2020. If you're only replacing some of your grout, try to color-match your existing grout as closely as possible. However, keep in mind that there may still be some variation, even if you buy the exact same brand and color of grout that was used before. That's because grout will change color over time as it oxidizes and absorbs dirt and grime. [3] X Expert Source Art Fricke Home Renovation & Repair Specialist Expert Interview. 1 July 2020."

Do an initial mix and then let it sit for a couple of minutes, and then mix the grout again. You may not want to mix it all at once. Just mix up a few cups at a time. [4] X Research source"

Be sure to distribute extra grout into the grout joints in order to fill them completely. Grout all areas of your tile floor except the expansion joints; these are the areas between the floor tile and bathtub, wall, door, and cabinet or sink area. The rubber grout float is a rectangular, flat tool with a steel handle and rubber surface used to distribute grout. Hold the rubber grout float at a 30 degree angle and distribute grout across the surface of the tile floor. Keep in mind that it is important to work quickly because the grout will harden in a short amount of time. [5] X Research source"

Do this by going over the tile with the rubber grout float, only this time use it at a sharp angle and move it diagonally across the tile floor in order to scrap the excess grouting material off.
