      "content": "Choose an appropriate needle. Do not use a sewing needle or pin -- piercing needles are cheap online and are made for piercings. There are a surprising number of suitable needles, but there are only a couple of considerations for piercing your tragus. Your needle should be: Hollow One size, or gauge, bigger than your earring (ex. an 11 gauge needle for a 12 gauge earring) Curved (Optional).

      "content": "Sterilize everything. The importance of this step cannot be stressed enough. Use antibacterial wipes on every surface and sterilize the needle, earring and cork. Be sure to wash everything first with soap and water to remove any dirt or grime. There are two accepted ways to sterilize equipment: Sterile a needle by holding it over an open flame for 10-15 seconds. Do no touch the needle to the flame. Sterilize equipment by mixing equal parts water and bleach in shallow bowl. Submerge your equipment and leave it there for at least one minute. Rinse with clean water. Anytime that your hands or equipment becomes dirty or contaminated, repeat this process completely."

      "title": "Put a thick piece of cork behind your tragus.",
      "content": "Put a thick piece of cork behind your tragus. This allows you to hold your tragus steady and stops the needle from continuing after it has pierced your tragus. Plug the cork in your ear so that it rests comfortably against the back of your tragus. You may need to cut the cork in half to fit it in your ear, but make sure it is at least 1/2 inch thick."

      "title": "Line up the needle with a mirror.",
      "content": "Line up the needle with a mirror. Make sure the needle rests in the middle of the tragus and is not crooked or angled. You can buy piercing markers as well to make a note where you want the earring if it helps. Never use regular markers, however, as the ink can enter your wound."

      "title": "Firmly press the needle straight through your tragus.",
      "content": "Firmly press the needle straight through your tragus. Use quick, even force to push the needle through your ear and into the cork. Do not push at an angle or try to jerk the needle in. Keep calm and push the needle through with a fast but methodical motion. To relax your body before piercing, inhale deeply and then push as you begin to exhale. Do not stop halfway, as this will only prolong the pain."

Gently twist and pull the needle to partially remove it. Leave a small amount of the needle in your ear -- this will help you put in the new earring easily."
