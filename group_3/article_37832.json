      "content": "This helps avoid any misunderstandings down the road. For example, if you’re looking for a serious relationship rather than something casual, don’t be afraid to mention this to your date. It might be nerve-wracking to be vulnerable in this way, but it’s definitely worth it in the end. As relationship psychologist Dr. Sarah Schewitz, PsyD explains, “A lot of people are kind of shy about saying what they really want. They don’t want to scare somebody off, but the logic behind that is flawed. You want to scare somebody off who’s not on the same page as you and doesn’t want the same things as you, to clear space for the person who is on the same page and does want the same thing.”"

Go to source This will show them that you’re genuinely interested in connecting. To avoid making the conversation feel like an interview, dating coach Lisa Shield recommends not jumping from topic to topic too fast. When you ask your date a question, really listen to their answer and ask follow-ups to go deeper on that topic. “Really great conversation happens when you take one topic, and then you go deeper with it,” Shield explains. “You might say, ‘Where did you grow up?’ And they may say, ‘I grew up in Detroit.’ And you might say, ‘Wow, tell me about Detroit. What was it like growing up there?’” While your date is talking, practice active listening skills , like paraphrasing what they’ve said and repeating it back, and asking thoughtful follow-up questions.

Clarifying this before the date can be helpful to avoid any awkward exchanges when the check arrives.

Don’t be afraid to tell them that you’d like to get to know them better, and be proactive about getting another date on the books!"
