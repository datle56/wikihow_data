      "content": "You’re likely on their mind if you have sweet dreams about them. While many psychologists theorize that dreams are connected to memory, many new age experts argue that dreams are bridges between the real and spiritual worlds. If they show up in your dreams more than once, it may be because their spirit is calling out to yours or you’ve both had the same dream. Call them up and see if they remember last night’s dream. If they don’t recall their dream, oh well! Use this as an opportunity to strike up a conversation."

If you listen closely enough, you may be able to hear what they’re thinking. Spiritually, when you experience ringing in your right ear , your guardian angels are sending you a positive message.

      "content": "A random eye twitch may happen because you’re on someone’s mind. A common superstition is that you've crossed someone's mind if your eye twitches without cause or reason. Some believe that when your right eye twitches, you’re being thought of positively, while a left eye twitch is from negative thoughts. Keep in mind if eye twitches are normal for you. For instance, if you experience frequent allergies or muscle spasms, this psychic sign may just be a superstition."

      "content": "Sudden hiccups are often a sign that someone’s thinking of you. While hiccups can naturally occur because you’ve eaten or spoken too fast, they can also be a spiritual sign that you’re being thought of. So, if you get the hiccups out of the blue, chances are you’re on someone’s mind. Consider what you’re doing when you get the hiccups. Were you eating, drinking, or talking? If you were doing nothing that could naturally cause hiccups, you might have caught them spiritually. Get rid of your hiccups by breathing into a paper bag, pulling your knees close to your chest, sipping cold water, or holding your breath.

For instance, are you prone to sneezing when you step into the sun? Is the pollen count high today? Does someone have a strong perfume on? Cancel out any possibilities before going to the spiritual."
