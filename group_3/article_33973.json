Chemotherapy is a method of treating cancer (and in some cases other similar diseases) which utilizes drugs that target and destroy fast-multiplying cells like cancerous ones. [1] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source As cancerous cells are defunct mutated versions of your own that grow at incredibly fast rates, chemo can be used to shrink and eliminate tumors throughout the body. In order to be informed about your situation and to make decisions, make sure to do research into your treatment plan and consult your oncologists accordingly. Many different drugs can be used during chemotherapy. Ask your oncologist which ones you will be receiving and research specific factors connected to each drug. Different chemo drugs will have different side effects depending on their intensity. Chemo is often used in adjuvant therapy by pairing it with radiation therapy or by first allowing chemo drugs to shrink the tumor and then turning to other methods to eliminate the cancer. [2] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source In other cases, depending on the progression of the tumor(s), it is used directly to eliminate the cancer."

Chemo is usually done over many months to allow for the drugs to kill more cancerous cells while allowing your body to rest and recover from any side effects. [3] X Trustworthy Source Cancer Research UK U.K.-based cancer research and advocacy charity Go to source In those months, (usually around 3-6), you will receive infusions based on your chemo plan in cycles. [4] X Trustworthy Source Cancer Research UK U.K.-based cancer research and advocacy charity Go to source Each infusion of chemo is done at a designated infusion center or hospital. Make sure to confirm your treatment schedule, procedure, and location with your oncologist. The pattern of your infusions is not spaced out evenly throughout the months. Instead, chemo takes place in a cyclical format, with the specifics varying from person to person. With each cycle, you will receive a varying number of sessions (infusions), though these sessions are usually not the same time apart from each other. [5] X Trustworthy Source Cancer Research UK U.K.-based cancer research and advocacy charity Go to source Familiarize yourself with this format so you can adequately prepare yourself for treatment. For example, you may have treatment for the first 3 days of your cycle, then rest for a few weeks. You may also have an infusion on the first day of a 3-week cycle and then the 8th day with no other infusions for the rest of the cycle. [6] X Trustworthy Source Cancer Research UK U.K.-based cancer research and advocacy charity Go to source In most cases while receiving an infusion, you will be hooked intravenously to an IV drip that delivers the drugs. [7] X Trustworthy Source Cancer Research UK U.K.-based cancer research and advocacy charity Go to source In this way, a chemo session can last from a couple of minutes to several hours. [8] X Research source Make sure to plan your schedule and your packing list according to the length of the session and the conditions at your infusion center/hospital. There are also chemo drugs that are ingested orally or applied as creams. [9] X Research source These are often paired with an IV drip."

Having a standard sleeping schedule makes it a lot easier to get more quality sleep as your body comes to expect sleep at a fixed time each night. [18] X Research source Remove any distractions from your sleeping environment. Keep your room quiet and dark and adjust the temperature to your comfort level. Put aside electronic devices. Try not to take naps during the day. While it's natural to feel tired, napping can make it harder for you to sleep at night.

      "content": "Try to get a friend or family member to accompany you. Cancer patients report that having someone you know accompany you to treatment can greatly help with your spirits and alleviate stress. Having someone to talk to during treatment can be a great support. Additionally, they can help with communicating with your doctor and can act as an informant to your medical team on your behalf in case you don’t feel well or there is an emergency. Inform your friend or family member about your treatment experience beforehand so they can better communicate it to a doctor when you are unable. Tell them about your side effects, medications, or just how you feel in general and other aspects of your chemo experience. If your friend or family member knows how to drive, have them bring you to and from treatment. That way, you’ll be able to secure transport for yourself as well."
