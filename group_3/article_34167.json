      "content": "Use conditioner to keep color dyes from bleeding onto lighter hair. During the dyeing process, coat lighter hair in conditioner to protect it. The conditioner will act as a shield when you rinse the dye itself out, lessening the unwanted contact that the dye has with your hair. Another option is to cover the dyed sections with foil or plastic. Then, rinse the darkest sections of your hair first to prevent them from bleeding onto the lighter sections."

      "content": "Wash and then wait 48 hours before shampooing your hair again after getting it dyed. You will need to shampoo and condition your hair right after dyeing it to get the dye residue out of your hair, but then wait 48 hours to wash it again. Washing it too much too early can dislodge the coloring agents. Though it wouldn’t affect the vividness of your dyed hair too much, those colors can easily find their way into the parts of your hair where you don’t want them. You can use warm water to wash your hair, just make sure it is not hot. Hot water opens up the cuticles in your hair and lets some of the dye out; run-off here will be particularly noticeable when you’re trying to keep the colors in your hair separate from one another.

Wear a shower cap or pin your hair up out the way to protect it on days you don’t want to wash your hair."

You’ll want to use shampoo that’s designed for color-treated hair, to better keep all your colors from bleeding. If your hair’s getting too dirty with fewer shampoos from fewer showers, try out a dry shampoo to keep your hair clean in those interim periods. Or, you can also try rinsing and conditioning your hair to get rid of excess oils and dirt between shampoos."

      "title": "Shower less.",
      "content": "Shower less. Water is the primary culprit in color’s bleeding and fading. While you need not swear off showers altogether (please don’t, actually), regular washing causes the dye to fade. If you usually shower every day, try transitioning to every other day. Or: wear a shower cap to protect your color on the days you’re only washing your body. To supplement this strategy, you can try adding a shower filter specially designed to cut down on mineral content in your water. Minerals like iron and lime are particularly harsh on dyes. This advice will be especially relevant if you’re looking to stretch out the timeline on your semi-permanent and demi-permanent hair dyes, as they’re intended to wash out around 12 and 24 shampoos, but keep in mind that this is just an estimate."

      "content": "Use hair sunscreen. Spritz some hair sunscreen onto your damp hair to better protect your color when you’re out at the beach, or going to be in the sun for extended periods of time. UV rays continue to penetrate and bleach hair, whether it’s dyed or not. Focus on the crown of your head with the sunscreen, as it receives the most sunlight. You could also look for a shampoo and/or conditioner that contains sunscreen, which is common in color-safe products."

      "content": "Go for a touch-up every 4 to 6 weeks. Waiting for your color to go away completely before dyeing it again will mean that you are starting over every time you dye it. Instead, get your hair touched up regularly to keep it vibrant. A visit to the salon once every 4 to 6 weeks should be sufficient."
