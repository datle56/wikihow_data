[1] X Research source You will need: A wire hanger. It cannot be a partially metal hanger made substantially of wood or plastic. A large, flat piece of cardboard. The tape of your choosing. Marking tape may be the easiest to work with; duct tape would certainly make the hoop durable. Markers or paint. Scissors. String (optional)."

      "content": "Bend the wire hanger into a circle. You do not even have to dismantle the hanger, but just reshape it into a hoop."

      "content": "Bend the hook of the hanger so that it is at a 90-degree angle with the hoop. Do not cut away the hook, as it still can be of some use."

    {
      "title": "Cut the cardboard to the size and shape of your liking.",
      "content": "Cut the cardboard to the size and shape of your liking. Standard high school, college, and NBA backboards are rectangular, if you are looking to replicate that appearance. Try to make sure the relative scare of the hoop and backboard seems reasonable. For comparative purposes, an NBA backboard is 6 feet wide, while the basket opening is 18 inches (1.5 feet). That means the basket width is 1/4 (or 25%) as wide."

      "title": "Decorate the hoop and backboard to your liking.",
      "content": "Decorate the hoop and backboard to your liking. Traditional hoops are painted red, but you can certainly customize it to fit whatever you desire. The backboards of most high schools, colleges, and all NBA franchises are now made of transparent glass; as there is no transparent cardboard, you can really be as creative as you want."
    },
    {
      "title": "Tape the hoop to the backboard.",
      "content": "Tape the hoop to the backboard. You can attach the hook (which you bent up earlier) to lower back side of the backboard. Make sure the rim is as close to the backboard as possible."

      "title": "Hang the completed basket to a wall or door.",
      "content": "Hang the completed basket to a wall or door. Masking tape will work well for this purpose, as it will not leave a sticky mess behind like duct tape would. There are two different taping methods you can employ. You can tape along the front perimeter of the backboard and extend the tape onto the wall to secure it. Alternatively, you can make tape hoops (by attaching a single piece of tape to itself, end-to-end with the sticky side out) and use these to attach the backboard to the selected surface."

      "title": "Fold the paper in half top-to-bottom, and then unfold it.",

      "content": "Then fold and unfold the paper again, this time left to right. Make sure that you make all of your folds in the same direction; in other words, do not make one fold toward you and the other fold away from you. All of the creases (including those in the next step) must leave an imprint on the paper point the same direction."

    {
      "title": "Fold and unfold the paper along both diagonals.",
      "content": "Fold and unfold the paper along both diagonals. Make sure that each corner and the sides match up perfectly as you fold. The paper should now have four creases in it, and will almost take a pyramid shape if left to sit on its own. It will only come together correctly if all four of the creases meet at a single central point."
    },
    {
      "title": "Fold all four of the mid-side crease points together at once.",
      "content": "Fold all four of the mid-side crease points together at once. Do not bend against the creases you created earlier. As you bend the four together, the diagonal creases will flow outward. The paper should appear to be a triangle if looked at from the side and a four-pointed star if viewed from above."

    {
      "title": "Curt two adjacent tips of the paper toward each other to make a hoop.",
      "content": "Curt two adjacent tips of the paper toward each other to make a hoop. You may be able to get the hoop to maintain its shape just by flexing the paper (especially if the paper is rigid). If the paper will not maintain the hoop shape on its own, you can tape the tips together. The tip of the triangle or pyramid from earlier is now usually considered the top. As you fold the tips together you may note how easily they form a basket that opens wider toward the top."
