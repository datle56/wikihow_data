      "title": "Each player gets 3-10 minutes to take their turns.",
      "content": "Each player gets 3-10 minutes to take their turns. In a typical game of chess, players get a total allotted amount of time to take their turns—time starts at the end of the opponent’s turn, and pauses at the end of your own. In Blitz Chess, that time is drastically shorter. Tournament rules often give either player a total of just 3-5 minutes to take all their turns. [1] X Research source This makes for an exciting, breakneck game that often involves many unconventional moves, as players are pressured to take their turns quickly. Some games also use “increment” timing, which is a brief buffer of only a few seconds that you may use to move pieces even after your base time expires."

      "title": "Players must move pieces and press the clock with the same hand.",
      "content": "Players must move pieces and press the clock with the same hand. During a game of Blitz Chess, players can only use one hand to both move pawns and hit the clock when their turn is finished. [2] X Research source This helps keep fair timing, and prevents mishaps on the board. During in-person games, players may only touch the clock to end their turn, or to straighten it when it’s been shifted. Also, players typically are not allowed to speak to each other, since both time and concentration are in short supply!"

      "content": "Win Blitz Chess by mating a king, or if your opponent runs out of time. Just like in standard Chess, the aim is to trap your opponent’s king. In Blitz Chess, though, the clock is more of a threat than ever, and you don’t want to be caught with no time left. If your time runs out and it’s possible for your opponent to mate with the pieces they have left, they win! [3] X Research source Also, many tournaments have stricter rules for illegal moves than in normal chess games. Some tourneys disqualify a player if they make a single illegal move, then hit the clock, so play carefully! It is possible for a game of Blitz Chess to end in a draw, like with a stalemate, or if one or both players run out of time without “mating material,” or conditions needed to checkmate (like which pieces are present on the board."

      "content": "Visit a chess club, or play online. Blitz chess, or similar versions of speed chess, are common ways to play the game, and you’ll likely find an opponent just about anywhere chess is played. Hit up a chess club, public chess location (like a public park), or a scheduled event to find other players. Blitz chess is also popular on online chess sites like Lichess or Chess.com . There are a number of chess clock apps available for both iOS and Android, or, bring your own Blitz Chess clock."

      "content": "Stretch your arms and fingers before the game. Players sometimes lose because of finger fatigue. Stretching your fingers and arms will help you stay limber and precise as you play. For a quick stretching exercise, flex your fingers 10 times, make a fist 10 times, then touch your thumb to each of your other fingertips 10 times each. [4] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Place your palm flat on a table. Straighten your fingers as flat as you can against the surface of the table, and hold for 30 seconds. Release and repeat 4 times. Stretch your arms all the way out on either side of your body, then up over your head. Then slowly swing your arms in large circles for 30 seconds. Breathe in for 10 seconds, then out for 10 seconds to settle your nerves before a game."

      "content": "Take note of your time, and the table layout, before you begin. Once the game starts, you may only use one hand to both move pieces and hit the clock, and you’re not allowed to reorganize the table, so take it all in and note where things are. Also take note of how much time you and your opponent are playing with, which is decided beforehand. [5] X Research source Black usually decides which side of the board to place the clock. They also often choose on which side of the table both players sit."

      "content": "Take the first move as White, and punch the clock after each turn. Just like standard chess, White takes the first move. [6] X Research source Start the clock, make your opening move, then reach over and hit the clock to pause your time as soon as your turn is over. As in standard chess, aim to checkmate your opponent. Unlike standard chess, though, a simple mate, or even just the possibility of a mate, is often enough to win the game, so long as your opponent runs out of time. Remember that the point of Blitz chess is playing a fun, fast chess game. If you take too long to agonize over your moves, you'll lose! Budget your time well."

      "content": "Play standard games of chess to learn more moves. A great way to improve at Blitz Chess is to play standard or even longer games, to familiarize yourself with common moves, gambits, and game situations in an environment where you can think through them. Grandmaster and world champion Sahaj Grover recommends even playing alone against yourself to puzzle out different situations. Then, those skills and knowledge will carry over to Blitz Chess, and you’ll find yourself making more advanced moves with less thought. Unfortunately, many Blitz Chess skills don’t transfer back to standard Chess, and may even encourage sloppy play. If your aim is to improve at Chess overall, focus on playing standard Chess games."

      "content": "Practice with players of all skill levels. One of the best ways to improve at both standard and Blitz Chess is to play with more advanced players that challenge you to better your game. Think about the moves they make and why to discover more about your own game. Also, play with less skilled players to learn which mistakes to avoid. Grandmaster Sahaj Grover says to record and play back your games, to analyze them later. Playing online is a great way to find players of all skill levels from the comfort of your home."

      "content": "Study game tactics to learn more about the game. Chess is a lot like learning a language. There’s a whole world of moves, strategies, and theories, and the more you’re familiar with them, the quicker you’ll be able to think and move with confidence. Grandmaster Sahaj Grover suggests reading books or using online tools or articles on the game to expand your game knowledge and hone your strategy."

      "content": "Avoid overly familiar openings. If you’re making the first move, keep in mind that some openings are better suited to Blitz Chess than others that might be better suited to standard Chess. In general, avoid familiar openings which your opponent might be able to play out with a simple variation. Instead, focus on openings that rely more on flexibility and adaptive thinking. [7] X Research source For example, some veterans recommend openings like the French , Scandinavian , or Caro Kann ."

      "content": "Play more complex or unexpected moves to stump your opponent. Time is of the essence in Blitz Chess, so the more you make your opponent think, the better. Whenever possible, go for a complex or opaque move to unbalance your opponent and make them fumble, costing them precious time.

The best Blitz players know their stuff, sure, but they also don’t agonize too much over any single move. [9] X Research source Keep your head clear, do what feels right, and keep the game moving. You’re not going to win every game you play, but every game is an opportunity to learn! If you make a mistake, analyze it, then go onto the next game."

      "content": "Play to keep your pieces to increase your odds of mate material. In many Blitz Chess games, players may claim a win if they have the pieces to mate their opponent when their opponent runs out of time. That’s why one strategy is to simply play to retain your pieces, making your opponent waste time so that when they run down the clock, even if you haven’t checkmated them, you win by default. [10] X Research source If you must, sacrifice a pawn over any other piece. Pawns are often disposable, but other pieces make for better mate material. On the other hand, an unexpected and risky attack may throw your opponent off their game, opening an advantage for you."

[11] X Research source In Blitz Chess, it’s especially easy to waste time thinking through a single move. If you need to buy time, make a quick, safe move, like moving your king back and forth, to stall and help you think through your strategy. Just be aware of what your opponent is doing. While you idle, your opponent may go on the offensive!"
