This is especially appropriate if you've already wished the person a happy birthday once. [4] X Research source For example, if you were attending a friend's birthday party, you might say \"feliz cumpleaños\" when you arrived, then say \"felicidades\" as you were leaving. You can also say \"felicidades en tu día,\" which means \"congratulations on your day.\""

[6] X Research source The lyrics for the basic Latin American birthday song are: \"¡Feliz cumpleaños a ti! ¡Feliz cumpleaños a ti! Feliz cumpleaños querido/a (name), feliz cumpleaños a ti. Ya queremos pastel, Ya queremos pastel, aunque sea un pedacito, pero queremos pastel.\" In Spain, on the other hand, you would sing \"Cumpleaños feliz, cumpleaños feliz, te deseamos todos, cumpleaños feliz.\""

Partygoers take turns trying to hit the piñata with a stick until it bursts, spraying goodies everywhere for all the partygoers to have. [10] X Research source The donkey-shaped piñata typically sold in the US and Europe is rarely seen in Latin American countries. The piñata may have a shape that reflects the theme of the \"tres leches\" cake. While partygoers attempt to hit the piñata, the others sing the traditional piñata song, which starts \"Dale, dale, dale.\" The song encourages the person to have good aim and hit the piñata so it bursts for everyone's enjoyment, raining down the sweets they crave."
