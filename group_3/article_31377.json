      "content": "Nope, you can choose whichever side you’d like! There are no right or wrong sides to nose piercings; it's all about how you’d like to look and which side of your face you want to show off more. If you’re not sure, you can use a glue-on gem or a clip-on piercing to see if you like having a nose ring on that side. When deciding which side would be best for you to pierce, think about what you do on a day-to-day basis. If you’re right-handed, it may be easier for you to take out and clean a piercing on the right side of your nose. Also, think about your normal sleeping position—sleeping on your right side when you have a right-side nose piercing might be uncomfortable and disrupt the healing process. [11] X Research source If you have a beauty mark, freckles, tattoos, scars, or other piercings, consider balancing them out by adding the piercing to the opposite side of your face. Your hairstyle can be another important factor. If your hair covers or flows towards one side of your face, consider balancing out your look by putting the piercing on the other side. You can also choose the side of your face you angle toward the camera when you take selfies."
