      "content": "Ensure you can send the item. Check with your carrier first about fragile, potentially hazardous, and international shipments. The destination country you’re shipping to may have restrictions you should know about so that your package is accepted. Check the Individual Country Listings of the International Mail Manual for rules regarding the country you’re sending to. Things that can decompose easily or can’t be reasonably expected to arrive at their destination without spoiling can’t be mailed internationally. For example, fresh vegetables, fruit, meat and other items. [3] X Research source Dry ice cannot be sent via international mail.

      "content": "Be informed about homemade canned or jarred foods. If you are sending homemade canned or jarred foods, you should check with the National Center for Home Food Preservation for information on which foods are considered unsafe for canning and are not recommended as gifts. Home-processed cheese and meat shouldn’t be mailed, as the moisture and acidity are unknown and can cause harmful bacteria. Examples of foods that are considered unsafe for canned gifts include herbs or vegetables in oil, breads or cakes, homemade chocolate or fudge sauce, and pumpkin butter. [5] X Research source Use only jars and lids that are recommended for canning, and only recipes tested for processing by reliable sources."

It is a lot less hassle and will require less packaging and handling considerations. For example, seasoning packets, hardy candy, dried fruits, and canned nuts don't require refrigeration. Homemade sweets like praline, toffee and sugar cookies don't need refrigerated packaging because their sugar content wards off bacteria."
