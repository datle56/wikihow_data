      "content": "Acquaint yourself with India and its culture. Before you register your company in India, it's a good idea to acquaint yourself with some basic facts about the country, its population and business practices if you aren't familiar with the country or haven't visited. If you're not familiar with the general landscape in India, from information on its society and customs to business practices, getting to know the landscape will smooth the process of registering and conducting your business in the country. Companies in the United States, for example, often conduct business on the basis of transactions, while Indian business is still largely relationship-based. Knowing the right network of people is likely to further your business more than focusing on specific transactions. [1] X Research source Knowing cultural differences is important, too. For example, cows are considered holy animals in India. Thus, if you're interested in selling beef in India, you would want to know if and where this type of business is possible."

For instance, you may not use a name that implies any connection to government or international organizations.
