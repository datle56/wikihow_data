      "content": "Use a dab of coconut oil. Coconut oil quickly removes regular and waterproof mascara, plus it moisturizes and smooths your skin . Because it is a solid at room temperature, rub a pea-sized scoop between your (clean!) fingertips until it becomes soft and spreadable. [1] X Research source You don't need a special coconut oil for your face--use the same coconut oil used as a cooking ingredient. [2] X Research source Be aware that if you get any in your eye it can temporarily blur your vision. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Try avocado oil . It is one of the most moisturizing oils [8] X Research source and, like other oils, easily dissolves and cuts through makeup. Look for dark avocado oil in a tinted container, which will preserve the quality of the product. Next time you make guacamole you can even try using avocado oil straight from the fruit! Cut the avocado in half and use a cotton swab to lift the oils from the inside (don't gouge it--you don't want any green stuff on your swab). [9] X Research source"

      "content": "Buy an eye-makeup remover formulated for your skin type . There are tons of options for makeup removers, so try narrowing down the choices by what works best for your skin. If you have oily skin or break out often, look for something oil-free. If you have very sensitive skin, you'll want a gentle, fragrance-free remover. [10] X Research source Oil is a necessary ingredient when you're trying to remove waterproof mascara , because it dissolves the oils in the makeup (instead of being repelled, like water). Oil-free makeup remover does exist, but it's not as effective for removing mascara as oil-based makeup removers. Dual-phase cleansers are good for everyday use. These cleansers contain a water-based and oil-based mixture. Simply shake the bottle, saturate a cotton pad, and apply to your face for a gentle, effective cleanser removal. [11] X Research source Cleansing water works well on sensitive skin and regular, non-waterproof mascara. [12] X Research source"

      "content": "Try baby oil if you run out of your usual cleanser. It's best to stick to an actual eye make up remover, since it's specifically made to be used around your eyes, but baby shampoo is an effective replacement if you run out. [13] X Research source Use a chemical and fragrance-free baby shampoo if you can. Many \"no tears\" formulas actually have a numbing agent, which will only mask the irritating effects.

      "content": "Avoid petroleum jelly (also known as mineral oil), or use very sparingly. Petroleum jelly is a byproduct of gasoline, and unless you know the brand you're using has been thoroughly refined and purified (Vaseline is one such brand), it's not something you want near your eyes. [16] X Research source Petroleum jelly does not actively hydrate your skin. If your skin is clean and moisturized it can seal the moisture in and keep it from evaporating, but it is not a replacement for moisturizer itself. [17] X Research source"

Apply enough makeup remover so that the pad is just saturated. [18] X Research source Don't use a cotton ball, as the fibers can detach and get in your eyes. If you're not sure how your skin will react to your makeup remover (whether it's coconut oil or from the drugstore), test some on your inner wrist. If you have a reaction it's better to have an inflamed wrist than an inflamed eye."

Don't scrub or tug on your skin, just press the pad against your lashes so the remover can begin to break down the makeup.

Once all of the mascara is removed from the top of the lash, place the pad slightly below the lower lash line and close the upper lash firmly on top of it. [20] X Research source You can wiggle the pad a little by your lash line to help break up more stubborn mascara.

Getting all the makeup off your face allows the your cleanser to get into your pores, instead of mixing with makeup and clogging them.

[24] X Research source Washing your face also removes any remnants of your makeup remover which, if it remains on your skin, can cause dryness or even an allergic reaction. [25] X Research source"
