      "content": "Clean the wound. Wash the wound for five minutes under cold water using antibacterial soap to remove obvious dirt from the area and to help avoid infection. You could also use mild dish detergent soap such as Ivory or Joy. [1] X Research source Avoid using hydrogen peroxide, rubbing alcohol, or iodide as these can actually slow healing.

      "content": "Check the wound for the staple. Look to see if the staple is still intact and that no parts of the staple, including any of the adhesive that holds the stick of staples together, have broken off in the wound."

    {
      "title": "Pull the staple straight out.",
      "content": "Pull the staple straight out. Try to pull the staple out in the same angle as it appears to be lodged into the wound. It should come out fairly easily; however, if it does not pull directly out or appears to be stuck or bent, seek medical attention, as you can cause more damage to the surrounding tissues as you pull it out. For a light staple, use tweezers. Heavier staples (such as those used on wood, or for bigger stacks of paper) may require the use of needle-nose pliers. Whatever you use, dip the tweezers or needle-nose pliers in a rubbing alcohol solution before bringing it anywhere near your wound. If you find the tweezers or pliers pinching the skin because the staple is flush against the skin, wedge out the staple a little bit with a flat, firm item like a nail file. Again, make sure to dip the nail file or other flat, firm item you selected in rubbing alcohol first."

      "title": "Use an antibiotic.",
      "content": "Use an antibiotic. Apply a thin layer of antibiotic ointment or cream, such as Neosporin, to the wound. If you develop a rash, stop using the ointment. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Consider the use of a bandage.",
      "content": "Consider the use of a bandage. Most puncture wounds will heal nicely without the use of a bandage; however, use a bandage if your wound is still bleeding or has a visible opening. The bandage will protect the wound from becoming dirty and irritated. Be sure to wash the wound with soap and water before applying the bandage. Change the bandage at least once a day or whenever it becomes wet or dirty. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Keep it elevated. If you experience pain, use a pillow to keep the injury elevated above at or above the level of your heart anytime you are standing or sitting down. This will help reduce swelling."

    {
      "title": "Use pain medicine if necessary.",
      "content": "Use pain medicine if necessary. Take an over-the-counter pain medication such as acetaminophen, ibuprofen and aspirin to also relieve the pain. Do not take more than the recommended dosage. For ibuprofen the dosage is 400 to 800 mg three to four times daily (max 3,200 mg/day). For acetaminophen the dosage is 650 mg every four to six hours (max daily dose: 3,250 mg daily). Do not give aspirin to anyone under the age of 19 unless you have permission from a doctor, as it may cause a serious condition known as Reye's syndrome. One side effect of chronic use of pain medications is that it can lead to gastric ulcers. Make sure that you do not take them for a prolonged time period."

      "content": "Examine the wound and the surrounding area. You need to first determine if the staple is still embedded in the wound and if any blood vessels, nerves or tendons were damaged by the staple. This will help you determine if you will need a tetanus shot. A tetanus shot might be needed if you received your last tetanus shot over 10 years ago, or if the staple was dirty or possibly dirty and you received your last tetanus shot over five years ago.

If the bleeding is severe, you will notice any of the following: blood is pumping from the wound, or the bleeding does not stop or slow down when applying pressure. You may also be bleeding so profusely that the blood is soaking through one bandage after another. [7] X Research source If this is the case, call emergency services for assistance."
