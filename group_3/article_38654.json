      "title": "Record a demo",
      "content": "Record a demo of your song. If you only write lyrics , get some help from a composer to set your words to music. Then, make a recording of the song. Once you have a demo, you can begin marketing yourself. [1] X Research source You don't need a perfect recording, but it should be professional. The more polished your sample is, the more likely it is to get passed on to an artist or agent. To record at home, use a high quality microphone attached to your computer. Record any instruments first, then vocals. Use recording software (free or paid) to put the instruments and vocals together. Clean up the sound by adjusting the volume so that it is consistent across the whole track and aligning any inconsistencies in rhythm."

      "content": "Make sure your song fits with an artist's sound. Before pitching a song to an artist, be able to picture that artist singing the song. It should fit in with their style and sound. For example, if you are interested in working with an artist with a retro sound, don't pitch them a song that you see as a club hit. [2] X Research source Making sure a song fits with the artist's style is more important than trying to pitch an artist a song you think will be a hit. Find up-and-coming artists by attending music festivals, conferences and expos, or by looking into publishers who work with new artists. Listen to the artist's work as much as you can to make sure your song fits with their sound."

[3] X Research source Contact artists through their manager or agent, if possible. Their contact information is usually easier to find, and they can help pitch you to the artist. For new artists, you can also try contacting them directly through email or social media. This approach works best for independent artists who don't have a record label."
