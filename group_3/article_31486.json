You can upgrade to one of these accounts. A business account is held by business owners. [1] X Research source Switch to business from your personal account by selecting the link “Upgrade to Business account” in the lower left hand corner of your home screen after logging into your personal account, and then follow the prompts. You can either “upgrade” your current account to keep the same profile name and email address, or you can “create new account” to have a separate account with a different email address. You can also find the “upgrade to business account” link by clicking the cog in the upper right hand corner after logging into PayPal, next to the “log out” button, and scrolling down. You will find the link under “Account options.”"

      "content": "Switch to a Premier account. Although you can switch to a Premier account to use the debit card, this is not widely advertised. A Premier PayPal account is for users who want to have a high transaction volume or accept personal credit card payments. It is basically a business account, but is useful if you don't officially own a business; it has all the features of a business account. [2] X Research source The only way to get a Premier account is to upgrade to it from within your personal PayPal account. You cannot open a Premier account from the PayPal homepage. Follow the same steps to upgrade to Premier as for upgrading to Business."

Once on the PayPal website, select the “Sign Up” button in the upper right hand corner."

      "content": "Select the button next to “Business Account.” After you elect to sign up, a screen will pop up giving you two options. You can select the bubble next to “Personal Account” or next to “Business Account.” Click the radio button next to \"Business Account.\" A business account should be opened by a business owner. There is no verification process for this, so technically you can open this type of account even if you don't own a business, but that is what this type of account is for. There are many extra features within the Business account that are useful for businesses, such as invoicing services and the ability to accept credit card payments. It is useful to use your EIN number instead of social security number for the Business PayPal account so that you can keep this income separate from your personal income for tax purposes."

Choose between “Standard” or “Pro” accounts. The Standard is free, and the Pro is $30 a month. The Pro offers customization for the checkout page on your business website.

To keep your account especially secure, it is wise to use a combination of all functions (lower case, upper case, numbers, and special characters) and then copy and paste the password into a document saved to your hard drive or phone so that you never lose it or need to memorize it. After you create a password, you will be prompted to enter personal information so that PayPal can keep track of your identity in future transactions."

However, you can’t pay for anything until you link a card or bank account, so it is smart to go ahead and choose either your debit card or bank account, or credit card, to attach to this PayPal account. This is in case your PayPal balance is ever too low."

If you’ve linked your bank account to PayPal, PayPal will give you three options for confirming the account. Your card may or may not need to be verified. Sometimes a card can be confirmed instantly. If you choose only one method of confirmation for your bank account, you will have a monthly cap on how much you can move to your checking account. If you use two forms of verification, the cap will be removed and you can transfer as much money as you want per month to your checking account from PayPal."

If you still don’t like having to enter your social security number, then read PayPal’s explanation.

The PayPal card is useful for people who conduct a lot of business over the internet and want to have instant access to their money without having to wait for it to transfer to their bank accounts. This is especially useful at an ATM, where you can literally get cash from your PayPal account while you’re out and about. You can use the PayPal Business Debit MasterCard at any ATM run by MasterCard, Maestro, or Cirrus. [7] X Research source"

Since you link your checking account to your PayPal account via bank account or debit card—or use a credit card—you will never have to stop using the PayPal debit card or worry that there’s not enough money in your PayPal account. When your funds are too low, the money is withdrawn from your bank account or credit card."

This means that if there is ever an unauthorized payment using your card, PayPal will reimburse the full amount as long as you follow their guidelines for reporting theft. [9] X Research source PayPal allows you 60 days to report the incident or error. You must call PayPal (or write to them) to report the unauthorized use of your debit card. You must include the following information: name, debit card number, explanation of the error, approximate date of error. A written summary of this information may be required within 10 days of reporting. It takes 10 to 45 business days to approve the error and refund the money, if the PayPal investigation confirms your report."

[10] X Research source It takes up to 48 hours after signing up to start seeing cash back accrue. [11] X Research source The cash back is calculated as a net percentage of your monthly purchases, meaning returns do not qualify, and is applied to your account at the end of each month. You also get cash back for catalog or phone purchases. You will be removed from the cash back program if your card is not used in 12 months."
