      "content": "Write down what is bothering you to clear your mind. You might just be feeling irritable or cranky in general. Or maybe you’re arguing with someone but you’re not exactly sure what started it. Take a minute to think about exactly why you are mad and write it down. This will help you figure out how to process your anger and move on. [2] X Research source For example, maybe you’re arguing with your partner about who forgot to take out the trash. Ask yourself if you’re really angry about that or if you’re still mad about something else that happened earlier in the day. Identifying the actual cause of your anger makes it easier to handle and can help you feel calmer. If you can, get in the habit of doing this earlier in the day so you have time to process these emotions. But if you get angry right before bed, it's good to do it then, too."
