      "content": "Submerge the sand dollars in fresh water to clean them. Place the sand dollars in a container filled with fresh water. As the sand dollar sits, the water should start to get brown. When the water gets to be a murky brown, replace it with fresh water and submerge the sand dollars again. Keep swapping out the water and submerging the dollars in fresh water until it stops turning brown. Fully cleaning the sand dollars could take anywhere from 1-3 hours. Sand dollars can be found in shallow water, in the sand on a beach, or under seaweed."

      "content": "Soak the sand dollars in a bleach and water solution for 5-10 minutes. Pour 1 part bleach and 3 parts cold water into a bucket or container to create your solution. This process will whiten off-white or brownish sand dollars. Wear a pair of rubber gloves and carefully place the sand dollars into the solution to bleach them. [1] X Research source Do not soak the sand dollars in the bleach solution for too long or they can crumble."

      "content": "Rinse off the sand dollars and let them dry. Run the sand dollars under cold water from your faucet to remove the bleach and water solution. Leave the sand dollars in a sunny place for 1-2 hours to dry them. Let the sand dollars completely dry before moving onto the next step. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Create a 1:1 mixture of water and PVA glue. Pour the PVA, or white glue, into a container and add an equal amount of water. Mix the solution together with a wooden stick or a brush until the glue and water are mixed thoroughly. Applying this solution will harden the sand dollar and make it easier to paint on. Elmer’s Glue-All is a popular type of PVA glue."

      "title": "Lay the sand dollars on 2 chopsticks and let them dry.",
      "content": "Lay the sand dollars on 2 chopsticks and let them dry. Lay 2 chopsticks or toothpicks on a table so that they are parallel to each other. Then, lay the sand dollar over the sticks so that the chopsticks or toothpicks prop the sand dollar off the surface of the table. This will serve as a makeshift stand and will prevent the solution from coming off the bottom of the sand dollar."

      "title": "Decide whether to use watercolor or acrylic paint.",
      "content": "Decide whether to use watercolor or acrylic paint. Watercolors will give your design a muted, cloudy image, while acrylic paint will produce richer, more vibrant colors. If you want a more precise design that’s easier to control, use acrylic paint. If you like more abstract and blended designs, use watercolors. [3] X Research source The way that these paints act on canvas or paper is similar to how they will react on your sand dollar. If you’ve painted with these mediums before, use your past experience to determine what kind of paint to use."

You’ll also need to use water to mix and apply watercolor paint. When the water starts to get a murky brown or gray, empty the cup in your sink and refill it with fresh water. [4] X Research source"

Unscrew the cap from the paint and slowly squeeze the bottom of the tube over your palette. Squeeze 1-2 drops of paint for every color that you want to use.

Follow along with the outline that you drew or follow the natural contours of the sand dollar. If you’re using watercolor, you’ll have less control over how the paint will react once it makes contact with the sand dollar. [8] X Research source Clean your brush in the cup of water before you switch colors or it could make your design look murky and brown. If you want to paint the top and bottom surface of the sand dollar, make sure you let it dry before flipping it over. If you're using acrylic paint, let the paint dry before applying a second coat so that the colors don't blend together."

Let it dry overnight before handling it. [13] X Research source Some polymer varnishes need to be mixed with water before they are used. Polymer varnishes can either be sprayed onto the sand dollar or applied with a paint brush."
