      "title": "Clean the rocks with soap and water.",
      "content": "Clean the rocks with soap and water. Fill a small bucket with hot, soapy water and soak the rocks. Scrub off any dirt and debris with a sponge or a toothbrush, making sure to get in all the cracks and crevices. When the rocks are clean, toss out the soapy water and rinse them with fresh water. Refill the bucket with clean water to use throughout the polishing process. [1] X Research source In addition to removing dirt, dampening the rocks makes it easier to grind them down."

      "title": "Smooth the corners of the rocks with 220-grit sandpaper.",
      "content": "Smooth the corners of the rocks with 220-grit sandpaper. Use coarser-grained sandpaper, like 220-grit, to round out the edges and do some rough shaping. Moisten the sandpaper and place it grit-side up on a flat surface. Wet the rock again and rub it along the sandpaper to remove the hard edges. Rewet the rock as needed and repeat the process until you achieve the desired shape. [2] X Research source Depending on how hard your rocks are, it could take 10-15 minutes of sanding to create a smooth surface. If your rocks are very hard, an even coarser sandpaper, like 80-grit, may work better. However, sandpaper this coarse should not be used on softer stones, as it may add more scratches than it removes."

      "title": "Remove heavy scratches with 500-grit sandpaper.",
      "content": "Remove heavy scratches with 500-grit sandpaper. Once you’ve buffed out the rough exterior of the rocks with coarse sandpaper, switch to a finer grain (400-grit could also work) and focus on any deep scratches on the surface of the rocks. Use softer, circular motions over the deeper scratches to buff them out evenly. [3] X Research source Again, rewet the rock as necessary and keep sanding until you achieve your desired results. The smoother the rock is, the better the polish will adhere and the greater the shine it will have."

      "title": "Remove light scratches and start polishing with 1200-grit sandpaper.",
      "content": "Remove light scratches and start polishing with 1200-grit sandpaper. Using extra-fine sandpaper buffs out any light, tiny scratches that remain on the surface. As you sand the rock, the shine will start to form. Keep the rock wet so you can spot any scratches or abrasions that have been missed. [4] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Rub toothpaste on the rocks.",
      "content": "Rub toothpaste on the rocks. Dampen a square of thick cloth, like denim, as heavy fabrics are better for polishing. [5] X Research source Then, squeeze some toothpaste onto it. Work the toothpaste and the fabric over the rock to create a shiny luster. Add more toothpaste as necessary until you achieve your desired shine. [6] X Research source It’s also possible to polish rocks with a clear gloss like Rustoleum , car wax , or to rub them in tumbling grit by hand. If you prefer, use an actual rock polishing compound according to its instructions. Most people agree that toothpaste works just as well, however, and it’s a much cheaper option."

      "title": "Rinse the rocks and coat them with mineral oil.",
      "content": "Rinse the rocks and coat them with mineral oil. Run the rocks under fresh water to remove any remaining toothpaste. Then, rub the rocks with a bit of mineral oil or a commercial rock polish to bring out the shine. Let the rocks dry completely, and then they’re ready to show off. [7] X Research source If you handle the rocks before they’re completely dry, you could smudge the polish or get small particles of dust in the coating. Additionally, the oil from your fingertips could leave blemishes on the polish. Test that the rocks are dry by touching them with the denim fabric. If none of the polish comes off on the fabric, they’re dry!"

      "title": "Put on gloves and safety glasses.",
      "content": "Put on gloves and safety glasses. Using a Dremel (rotary tool) is another efficient way to polish rocks without a rock tumbler, but it can cause small particles of grit and rock to fly off in the process. Dust and rock particles can irritate or injure your eyes, so be sure to wear safety glasses. Wearing gloves will improve your grip and keep your hands protected if the drill happens to slip. [8] X Research source Use a thick and sturdy type of glove like leather, puncture-resistant, or heavy fabric gloves. Thin rubber gloves will improve your grip but won’t protect your hands."

      "title": "Attach a sanding attachment to the rotary tool.",
      "content": "Attach a sanding attachment to the rotary tool. Dremels have many attachments you can use for various projects. [9] X Research source For grinding and smoothing rocks, use an attachment designed for sanding. Insert the attachment into the opening at the end of the rotary tool and make sure it’s secure. Don’t use a drill bit or other type of attachment to polish or grind rocks because it could break the rock or cause a large fragment to fly off and possibly injure somebody. Sanding rocks with a Dremel is a quicker option than using sandpaper."

      "title": "Place the rock in a spring or C clamp.",
      "content": "Place the rock in a spring or C clamp. To protect your hands and prevent the rock from slipping when you grind it with the rotary tool, use a clamp to secure it. A spring clamp or a C clamp will grip the rock without crushing it. Put the rock in the clamp and make sure it’s tight and secure. [10] X Research source Make sure the clamp isn’t so tight, however, that it could crack or break the rock."

      "title": "Grind the rock with the top half of the sanding bit.",
      "content": "Grind the rock with the top half of the sanding bit. To prevent scratches in the rock, use the top half of the sanding bit to grind the entire surface of the rock. When you’ve sanded the surface, adjust and move the rock in the clamp so you can cover any areas that you missed. Continue grinding the rock until you achieve your desired results. [11] X Research source Once you’re done grinding the rock, go on to polish it with your preferred polish, like toothpaste or a commercial rock polish."

      "content": "Hand polishing is cost-effective. High-quality rock tumblers can be expensive, and they may not be worth buying if you don’t plan on polishing a lot of rocks at one time. Hand polishing, on the other hand, is more affordable, as you only really need sandpaper and a type of rock polish. Even household items like toothpaste, mineral oil, or car wax work.

      "content": "Hand polishing is faster than using a tumbler. Many people think using a rock tumbler is a quick way to polish rocks, but it usually takes several days to several weeks depending on the stones. [13] X Research source If you’re only polishing a few at a time, hand polishing is much faster, as it can be completed within a few hours."

    {
      "title": "It works better on softer stones.",
      "content": "It works better on softer stones. Depending on the type of rocks you’re polishing, using a tumbler may be too rough. Stones that are on the softer end of the Mohs hardness scale (like turquoise and amber) tend to do better with hand polishing. [14] X Research source It’s also possible to hand polish harder stones, as well."

      "title": "It can be relaxing.",
      "content": "It can be relaxing. Many people enjoy hand polishing rocks because it’s calming and allows them to be more hands-on with their hobby. If you use a rock tumbler, the machine does most of the work for you, so it may not feel as rewarding."

    {
      "title": "Hand polishing requires you to do all the work yourself.",
      "content": "Hand polishing requires you to do all the work yourself. When you hand polish rocks, you first have to wash them, sand them down with sandpaper or a rotary tool, then apply the polish yourself. This may sound complicated, but many people enjoy the process, and it’s much faster than using a rock tumbler. [15] X Research source"

      "title": "Tumbling rocks is less labor-intensive.",
      "content": "Tumbling rocks is less labor-intensive. A rock tumbler is a machine that shapes and polishes stones by spinning them around in a mixture of water and tumbling grit. Tumbling is a good option if you aren’t able or don’t want to polish each rock by hand, though it often takes several days or several weeks to achieve your desired results. [16] X Research source"

      "content": "Consider buying polishing tools if you polish a lot of rocks. If you only want to polish a couple of rocks, it’s probably cheaper and quicker to just polish them by hand. However, if you polish a lot of rocks regularly, hand polishing would take up a lot of time and it might be better to invest in a rock tumbler."
