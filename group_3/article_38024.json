      "content": "Search the internet for a PNG you want to download. Perhaps you want sparkles for an edited image, a completely blank PNG, or a border PNG for your favorite photograph. If you're using Google Chrome, simply type what you want to download as a PNG and select the \"Image\" tab. If you're using Yahoo, type what you want to download as a PNG and select the \"Image\" tab, just like Google. Same goes for Bing. On Imgur, just type something in and images will show up right away. Note that if you add \"images\" after a search on Google, Yahoo, or Bing, images will automatically show up. Be sure to add \"PNG\" at the end of your search, so only PNG files will show."

      "content": "Look for and click on the PNG you want. If it shows a white and gray checker-board before you click on an image, then it's not an actual PNG file and on other platforms will show up as the image with white and gray squares behind it, which is not what you want. Instead, look for PNGs with a solid white background. You'll be able to see the size of the image by hovering over it with your mouse cursor on Google."
    },
    {
      "title": "Wait for the image to process.",
      "content": "Wait for the image to process. When you first click the PNG you want, you'll have to wait about 5 seconds for it to remove the solid white background. Note that it's okay for there to be a white and gray background when you actually click on the PNG. This has to happen for it to show it's a transparent background and not just an image with a solid white background. The image will be in the lowest quality possible when processing. Once it's finished loading, it'll be in the highest quality your search engine can do."

If the PNG you're downloading is of a red tree in fall, don't name it \"Winter tree\". This will only confuse you more. Sometimes, less is more. You may just want to name your PNG file \"PNG1\", if that helps you."
