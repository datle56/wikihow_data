      "content": "Set the kiwis you want to ripen on the counter at room temperature. Kiwi fruit continues to ripen after it’s picked—if you bought some firm, unripe fruits, they’ll soften and sweeten up at home. Just place the kiwis in a bowl on your countertop and keep them away from direct sunlight and heat, as this can cause them to rot quickly or get discolored. [1] X Research source How long does it take the kiwis to ripen? Most firm kiwi fruits will ripen on the counter in 3 to 5 days if stored at room temperature. Most kiwi fruits that you find in the grocery store, like the green and golden flesh varieties, ripen perfectly fine off the vine. If you're growing your own kiwi fruit plant , check the variety you have to determine whether you should leave your fruit on the vine until it's ripe or harvest it while it's hard."

      "content": "To speed up ripening, place the kiwis in a paper bag with a banana or apple. The quickest way to ripen a firm kiwi fruit is to store it near fruits that produce ethylene gas, like bananas, apples, and pears. This exposes the kiwis to more ethylene, which tells them to ripen faster. Simply place the kiwis in a paper bag with the other fruits and keep them on your counter at room temperature. [2] X Research source How long does it take the kiwis to ripen? Most firm kiwi fruits will ripen in 1 to 2 days when kept in a paper bag with a banana or other fruit that produces ethylene gas. [3] X Research source Keep the bag out of direct sunlight and away from heat sources, as this can cause the fruits to rot quickly. Do not place the kiwi in a plastic bag. This can reduce air flow and trap moisture, causing the fruits to rot and grow mold."

      "content": "Press the kiwi fruit lightly to see if it has a little give. According to Dulaney, the best way to tell if a kiwi fruit is ripe is to give it a gentle squeeze with your thumb. If the kiwi is mostly firm with a little give and softness, it’s perfectly ripe. Avoid kiwi fruits that are very soft or mushy, advises Marrow Private Chefs, as this is a sign that they’re overripe and will go bad quickly. Remember, if you pick a kiwi that’s very firm and unripe, it’ll soften and sweeten up if you leave it on your counter at room temperature."

      "content": "Smell the kiwi for a sweet, fruity scent. When kiwi fruits ripen, they have a noticeable and pleasant fruity smell. If the scent is very faint or nonexistent, the fruit is probably unripe. And if the kiwis smell fermented, sickly sweet, or slightly sour, they’re most likely overripe and starting to rot.

However, there are some varieties that have red or green skin."
