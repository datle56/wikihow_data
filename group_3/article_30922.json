      "content": "Wash your vegetables. Wash your own hands in warm, soapy water for about 20 seconds. Then, rinse your vegetables under the faucet, gently rubbing as needed to remove any stuck on dirt. [1] X Research source You may need to use a vegetable brush on tougher vegetables, like squash, to get out stuck on dirt and debris."

      "title": "Remove any skins.",
      "content": "Remove any skins. Things like onions, potatoes, and garlic should usually be peeled prior to cooking. You can simply peel off the skin of onion or garlic, but things like potatoes and squash require a vegetable peeler. When peeling an onion, you may accidentally peel off the top layer when removing the skin. You can still use an onion after peeling off the top layer, so do not worry if this happens. Not all vegetables require peeling prior to cooking. Consult your recipe to see if you need to peel your vegetables first."

      "title": "Cut the vegetables in half.",
      "content": "Cut the vegetables in half. Cut off any ends with leaves or stems. Then, cut the vegetables in half length-wise. This will make it easier to dice them prior to mincing."

      "content": "Chop the vegetables in perpendicular slices. Hold the vegetables with bent fingers as you cut, keeping your fingers just behind the knife. [2] X Expert Source Dorrenda Smith Personal Chef Expert Interview. 26 October 2021. This allows for greater control while cutting. Cut the vegetables length-wise, keeping the slices about half an inch to a quarter of an inch apart. When you're done, you should have several thin slices of vegetables."

      "title": "Line up your vegetable slices.",
      "content": "Line up your vegetable slices. Take the perpendicular slices you just made and place the vegetables on a cutting board. Keep them close together when lining them up, but be sure to avoid any overlap. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Dice the slices.",
      "content": "Dice the slices. Take your knife and cut along the vegetable slices cross-wise. Make a series of cuts, each one about a quarter of an inch apart, running down the lines of vegetables. When you're done, you will be left with small blocks of diced veggies. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Push your diced vegetables into a small pile.",
      "content": "Push your diced vegetables into a small pile. Some overlap here is okay, as mincing is a less precise process than dicing. Your pile should be small and compact. You can either use your knife or hands to push the vegetables together. [5] X Research source If you use your hands to push your veggies together, wash your hands first."

      "title": "Rock your knife over your vegetables.",
      "content": "Rock your knife over your vegetables. Start at one end of your pile. Place the palm of your hand on the dull side of the knife. Use your palm and the hand holding the knife to rock the knife back and forth, following the natural curl of the blade. Move the knife across the pile of veggies gradually, continuing this gentle, rocking motion as you go. [6] X Expert Source Dorrenda Smith Personal Chef Expert Interview. 26 October 2021."

      "title": "Stop rocking just before the vegetables form a paste.",
      "content": "Stop rocking just before the vegetables form a paste. Continue with the same basic motions, moving the knife back and forth across your vegetables. The goal is to get the vegetable pieces as small as possible. Once you notice some of the veggies forming a paste-like liquid, stop. This is a sign that the vegetables are adequately minced as they're starting to lose form. Minced vegetables should be mostly solid. [7] X Research source Times vary depending on the type of vegetable you're mincing. Softer vegetables, like garlic, will mince faster than sturdier vegetables like potatoes."

They should break apart in tiny, delicate pieces [9] X Research source A grater is not the best choice for delicate vegetables, like garlic, as will cause them to form a paste."

[10] X Expert Source Dorrenda Smith Personal Chef Expert Interview. 26 October 2021. You can do so after dicing the vegetables into small, bite-sized chunks.
