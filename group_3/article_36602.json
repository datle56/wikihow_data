      "content": "Roll your vehicle window down 1 ⁄ 4 inch (0.64 cm). Open your vehicle door so you can access the inside of the tinted window. Crack your window just a little so that you are able to reach the very top and see the edge of the tint. [1] X Research source Do the windows in the doors first and save the rear window for last, especially if it has defrost capabilities. This will give you a chance to practice your technique so you can remove the tint more easily while making sure not to mess up the defrost lines. If you’re doing windows in your home, you can skip this step."

      "title": "Steam",
      "content": "Steam both the outside and the inside of the windows. Any handheld clothing or upholstery steamer will work for this project. Hold the steamer 1–2 inches (2.5–5.1 cm) away from the window and steam the entire outside of the window first. Then, apply steam to the inside of the window. Work in long, sweeping motions from the top to the bottom and try to heat the pane of glass evenly. [2] X Research source Steaming the outside helps heat up the window enough for the adhesive to dissolve. You don’t need to do this for the rear window of your vehicle or if the windows in your home are on the second level and you can’t access them easily, though."

      "title": "Use a straight razor to lift up the edge of the tint.",
      "content": "Use a straight razor to lift up the edge of the tint. Carefully place a straight razor underneath the tint at one corner of the inside of the top of the window. Using a razor to loosen the edge of the tint will make it easier to peel off. [3] X Research source If you can’t get the corner of the tint to come up, apply more steam and try again."

      "title": "Peel the tint off slowly while continuing to apply steam.",
      "content": "Peel the tint off slowly while continuing to apply steam. Work slowly and pull the tint down from the top of the window toward the bottom of the window. Keep applying steam, paying special attention to any particularly stubborn spots. [4] X Research source If you try to pull the tint too quickly, it will tear and make the job that much harder. If that happens, use the razor to lift the edge of the tint again and continue peeling it off."

      "content": "Remove any remaining adhesive with a commercial cleaner. Mix 1 part commercial cleaner, like 409, and 1 part water in a spray bottle so you can easily apply it to the window. [5] X Research source Spray it on and scrub the glue spots with a non-scratch pad, then dry the glass with a paper towel. Wipe the door panels or window frame with a clean microfiber cloth to remove any water from the steaming process. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Repeat the process on each tinted window. You can use the same technique to remove the tint from each of the windows in your vehicle or home. Go slow and take your time so that you can remove all of the tint from each window in a single piece."

      "title": "Steam the back window of your vehicle for 7 minutes before peeling the tint away.",
      "content": "Steam the back window of your vehicle for 7 minutes before peeling the tint away. If you’re working on a vehicle, position the steamer right up against the interior glass of the back window. Tie something around the trigger to keep it going and prop up the steamer so it stays in place. Close the doors to your vehicle and let the steamer run for 7 or more minutes.

      "content": "Mask the door panels of your vehicle or the window frame in your home. To protect them from the ammonia, cover the interior door panels or window frame with tarps or plastic sheeting and tape it in place. Don’t use newspaper or another absorbent material as the ammonia will soak through it. Be sure to cover all of the electrical components in your vehicle well, such as switches and speakers."

      "content": "Cut black garbage bags to the size of your windows. Place a black garbage bag over one of the windows and use a metallic marker to trace the outline. Cut it out and separate the bag so you have 2 pieces: 1 for the inside of the window and 1 for the outside. Repeat for each window. You only need to cover the inside of the windows with garbage bags if you’re working on windows in your home and can’t easily reach the exterior."

Shake up the bottle and spray the outside of each window. Then, place a garbage bag to the glass so it covers it completely. The soapy water helps the garbage bag stick to the window. Skip this step if you can’t access the outside of the windows in your home."

Spritz the inside of a window so it’s fully saturated then press the garbage bag into place so it covers the glass. The liquid should hold the plastic in place all on its own, but you could use masking tape to secure the bags if necessary. Repeat for each window. If you don’t want to use ammonia or don’t have any on hand, you can use a mixture of water and soap or baby shampoo on the inside of the windows, instead. [10] X Research source"

Slowly and carefully pull the tint away from the glass from one edge of the window to the other. Work slowly so the tint doesn’t rip! If it does, slide the razor underneath the edge of the tint so you can lift it up and continue removing it."

Scrub any stuck-on adhesive with fine steel wool. Then, wipe away the debris and liquid with newspaper. If the adhesive doesn’t come off easily, use a razor to scrape it away, being careful not to damage the window.
