      "content": "Use a pry bar to remove the countertops. Most countertops are bracketed to the base cabinets. If the counter is attached to the base cabinet with nails or an adhesive, use a pry bar to remove it. Put the claw of the pry bar under the rim of the counter, and press down on the free end until the countertop begins to lift up. Work slowly around the counter and use only the minimum amount of force needed to remove the adhesive in order to avoid damaging the base cabinets. Laminate backsplashes can be removed at this time as well. Use your chisel and a hammer to remove the laminate coating from the backsplash. Underneath, there should be a board screwed into the wall. Use a drill or screwdriver to remove the board.

      "title": "Remove each tile from a tile countertop.",
      "content": "Remove each tile from a tile countertop. Remove the tile from the surface of the countertop with a flat chisel. This frees the countertop and also reduces its weight, making it much easier to lift out. First, carefully pry the tile running up the backsplash away from the wall. Remove the rounded, bullnose tile along the front of the countertop. Repeat the process on the tile glued to the countertop, slicing between the mortar and wood underlayment. When the tile is removed, go under the counter and use a screwdriver to take off the brackets holding the countertop to the base cabinets. Lift the countertop off. Some tile countertops have an underlying layer of wood. After removing the top layer, check to see if there is any wood. If so, use a pry bar to remove the remaining wood."
