      "title": "Turn off the car’s engine using the ignition key.",
      "content": "Turn off the car’s engine using the ignition key. As long as you have your key out of the ignition, you are fine. Don’t try touching the lighter wires or the fuses while the car is running. Make sure the radio isn’t running since the cigarette lighter socket often shares a fuse with the other components in the middle of your car. [1] X Research source Stay safe by turning off the vehicle before handling any wires or connected components. If you don’t take the proper precautions, you could end up sticking metal inside the socket while it is still active."

      "title": "Locate the fuse box in the vehicle.",
      "content": "Locate the fuse box in the vehicle. The fuse box typically is underneath the hood or the dashboard. Check inside the glove box on the passenger’s side if you don’t see it anywhere else. It looks like a covered black box with a bunch of colored plugs inside of it and is sometimes labeled. [2] X Research source If you can’t find the fuse box, consult your owner’s manual for more information. Some vehicles even have multiple fuse boxes controlling different parts."

      "title": "Remove the cigarette lighter fuse with a pair of pliers.",
      "content": "Remove the cigarette lighter fuse with a pair of pliers. Look for letter labels near the fuses or on the fuse box cover. You can usually remove a fuse box cover by hand, but you may also need a Phillips head screwdriver for yours. Once you locate the fuse responsible for the cigarette lighter, use needle-nose pliers to pull it out of the box. Set the small fuse aside in a safe location until you’re ready to put it back. [3] X Research source If you don’t see a fuse box diagram inside your vehicle, check for one in the owner’s manual."

      "title": "Use a multimeter to make sure you deactivated the lighter.",
      "content": "Use a multimeter to make sure you deactivated the lighter. A multimeter is a handheld device that detects electrical currents. To test the lighter, you have to first find an exposed piece of metal in your vehicle, such as a bolt on the door. Hold the black probe to the piece of metal, then touch the red probe to the cigarette lighter socket. If the meter moves, the socket still has an active current and isn’t safe to touch. [4] X Research source You can get multimeters at most hardware or auto parts stores. If the meter picks up electrical activity, check the fuses again. You may have removed the wrong one by accident."

      "title": "Use a hook to reach the slots in the cigarette lighter.",
      "content": "Use a hook to reach the slots in the cigarette lighter. Look inside the cigarette lighter socket to find the small openings around its sides. These slots allow you to grip the socket, but you need a strong piece of metal to remove it. The easiest tool to use is a lighter socket removal tool, which looks like a small metal bar with a pair of prongs on the end. Fit the prongs into the slots to begin removing the socket. [5] X Research source You can find socket removal tools online. Also, ask at your local auto parts stores for alternatives. If you don’t have a socket removal tool, find something similar that fits inside the lighter socket. For instance, you could use a metal hook or bend a metal coat hanger to latch onto the socket slots."

      "title": "Turn the lighter socket clockwise to loosen it.",
      "content": "Turn the lighter socket clockwise to loosen it. The socket rests inside a second metal tube on your vehicle. Unlike most other connectors in the vehicle, you have to spin the socket clockwise to disconnect it from the tube. Use the removal tool to loosen the socket by spinning it in place. When the socket is loose, it turns freely and may even pop out of the dashboard. [6] X Research source The socket is often a little stubborn at first, so put some force into turning it. You may need to get a pair of pliers to turn the socket by hand."

      "title": "Pop off the dashboard panel if you can’t remove the socket.",
      "content": "Pop off the dashboard panel if you can’t remove the socket. If the socket loosens but doesn’t pop out, pry off the panel around it. Check the panel first by trying to remove it with your hands. If you can’t remove it by hand, get a plastic pry tool and slide it underneath the panel. Work around the edges of the panel, gently prying it away from the rest of the car until you are able to lift it and look behind it. [7] X Research source Shop online or visit your local hardware and auto parts stores for pry tools. Make sure you get plastic ones instead of metal to avoid damaging the car panel. The cigarette lighter socket may still be attached to the rest of the car, so don’t rip the panel off as soon as you detach it. This is especially true if the socket is near the radio, since the radio and climate control wires most likely also attach to the panel."

      "title": "Unplug the wire connector if it is still attached to the socket.",
      "content": "Unplug the wire connector if it is still attached to the socket. Lay the panel flat so you are able see any wires behind it. Find the back end of the socket and check it for a wire attachment. If the lighter socket has a wire in it, squeeze the plastic connector, then pull it away from the socket. The connector is typically a round piece of plastic with a bright coloring like blue. [8] X Research source The connector is usually easy to remove by hand. You may need to pull it with a little bit of force to pop it off of the socket. You can remove other connectors on the panel. If you removed the plate around the radio, for instance, the radio controls also have plastic connectors. You don’t need to remove those connectors, but unplugging them gives you a little more room to maneuver."

      "title": "Pull and turn the socket as needed to finish removing it.",
      "content": "Pull and turn the socket as needed to finish removing it. Reach behind the panel to push the lighter socket toward you. Most sockets pop out of the dashboard panel without much difficulty. You may also need to spin the socket to loosen it a little more before it pops out. Grab the front end of the socket to turn it by hand until it slides out of the panel. [9] X Research source Try to avoid forcing the socket out. It is pretty easy to remove, so if it feels stuck, chances are it is still attached to the car. Check for a wire connector and rotate the socket clockwise until it loosens. If you can’t remove the socket and know that you cleared away any wires, use pliers to turn it until it loosens."

      "title": "Remove the side panel to access the back end of the lighter.",
      "content": "Remove the side panel to access the back end of the lighter. If the lighter is near the gear stick in your vehicle, reach into the chamber underneath the stick to get to the socket. Move the seats back as far as possible, then pull off one of the plastic panels in the center part of your car. If you can’t get the panel off by hand, use a plastic pry tool to wedge the panel off of its mount. Work slowly around the edge of the panel until you are able to slide it off. [10] X Research source Get pry tools by shopping online or visiting hardware or auto parts stores. The panels you need to remove are underneath the gear stick and very noticeable. As long as you remove one panel on the chamber housing the gear controls, you can reach the lighter."

      "title": "Turn the wire connector counterclockwise to pop it off the socket.",
      "content": "Turn the wire connector counterclockwise to pop it off the socket. Look for a plastic wire connector on the back end of the lighter socket. It has a green and a black wire coming out of it, connecting the socket to the rest of the car. To remove it, grip it lightly between your fingers and rotate it counterclockwise. It comes free after about a quarter of a turn, so turn it slowly to avoid pulling the wires. [11] X Research source The wire connector looks like a round plug. It is often gray, but it might be a different color in your car. The plug always has a pair of wires, green and black, that make it recognizable. Some cigarette lighter sockets have 2 different plugs. One plug on the side holds the green ground wire while the other plug in the center holds the black power wire. Remove both plugs if your vehicle has them."

      "content": "Take the clips off the electrical connector to remove it. The next component on the lighter socket looks like a round, gray cap with an opening holding another wire. It has a pair of wing-like clips on the side. Grab both of the clips and gently pull them away from the cigarette lighter to slide the connector off of it. [12] X Research source The electrical connector has a red wire supplying power to lighter. Set the connector aside to avoid damaging the wire."

      "content": "Use a socket wrench to remove the nut holding the lighter in place. Removing the connectors exposes the back end of the lighter socket. The nut is a metal ring with an opening in the center and it fits over the back end of the socket. The easiest way to remove it is by fitting a 1 ⁄ 16 in (0.16 cm) socket wrench over it. Twist it counterclockwise a few times until it is loose enough to twist off by hand. [13] X Research source Finish removing the nut by continuing to turn it counterclockwise by hand. Slide it off of the socket and set it aside."
