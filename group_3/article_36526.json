      "content": "Make a turmeric mask. Mix 2-3 tablespoons of gram flour and ¼ teaspoon of turmeric powder in a bowl. Add lemon or cucumber juice and approximately ½ teaspoon of milk to the powder mixture. Mix these four ingredients together until it forms a smooth paste. Apply the mask to the dark patches on your skin for 10 minutes. The mask will dry as you wait. Use warm water to gently remove the mask after the 10 minutes is finished. Use the mask on your dark patches twice a week until the patches have lightened to where you're comfortable. The milk measurement is approximate. You'll want to add enough to turn the mixture into a paste. If you have sensitive skin, use cucumber juice rather than lemon juice. Note that turmeric powder can easily stain fabrics, so be careful with your clothes and towels. Gram flour is flour made from ground-up chickpeas."

A family doctor is not likely to perform such a procedure. A chemical peel is exactly what it sounds like. A dermatologist will apply a gel or cream-like substance to your skin which contains one of the above mentioned acids. They will then leave it on your skin for a specific period of time before peeling it off. It is likely that you will need more than one chemical peel in order to see a significant change in the colour of your dark patches."
