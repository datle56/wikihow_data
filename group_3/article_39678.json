    {
      "title": "The attraction feels too good to be true.",
      "content": "The attraction feels too good to be true. You and your karmic partner hit it off right away. Or sometimes, even before you meet—you just get the feeling that someone meant for you will arrive soon. And things seem great at the start. Too great. Truth is, you were meant for each other, but not for forever. [2] X Research source Karmic relationships tend to be short, which is why this sign, which comes early in a relationship, can also be a sign that the relationship won’t pan out (not the way you want it to, at least)."
    },
    {
      "title": "You ignore the red flags.",
      "content": "You ignore the red flags. You trust your intuition, and in the past you’ve bailed on potential partners that didn’t seem to fit the bill. For some reason, though, you’re overlooking this person’s red flags; you’ve decided that this person’s faults are worth your strong connection. [3] X Research source It’s not necessarily your fault for overlooking the signs—there are greater forces bringing the two of you together, after all."
    },
    {
      "title": "Your partner starts to have boundary issues.",
      "content": "Your partner starts to have boundary issues. Bit by bit, your partner starts to control your daily life. They don’t want you to spend time without them or they object to your friends. They also dictate more significant decisions, like financial choices. You start to feel less like an individual and more like a child or a dependent. [4] X Research source In addition, your partner often prioritizes their own wants and needs over yours. You feel like you have little say in how the two of you spend your time."

    {
      "title": "You can’t communicate clearly.",
      "content": "You can’t communicate clearly. At the start, you were always on the same page, and even seemed to read each other's thoughts. Now, you and your partner tend to talk past each other, or you say one thing and mean another. Somewhere along the line, your words stopped mattering as much as they used to. [5] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "You fight more often than not.",
      "content": "You fight more often than not. At some point, your go-to pastime became bickering. Relationship quarrels are easy when the two of you are so alike; you know how to press the right buttons and get a rise out of each other. Sometimes, these fights feel more obligatory, like you’re not sure what else you’d be doing if you weren’t bickering. [6] X Research source Some people think you fight with your karmic partner because you feel wrongs from your past life come to the surface, creating reasons to bicker that you feel you can’t explain, since those reasons didn’t originate in your current life."
    },
    {
      "title": "You repeatedly break up and get back together.",
      "content": "You repeatedly break up and get back together. Karmic relationships present many sorts of patterns, and one such pattern is a cycle of splitting and reuniting. The relationship ends when one of you can’t take it anymore, but you also feel like you can’t live without them, so you make up and try to make it work. [7] X Research source It may be that your relationship hasn’t yet fulfilled its karmic purpose, or you haven’t learned the lesson it was sent to teach you. That doesn’t mean you shouldn’t try to exit the relationship anyway."
    },
    {
      "title": "You drop everything to help your partner.",
      "content": "You drop everything to help your partner. It’s classic codependence. You rush to your partner’s aid, even when helping them comes at your own detriment. [8] X Research source You feel a strange compulsion to sort out their problems for them, and they feel the same for you. But this codependence isn’t sustainable, and sooner or later it’ll come to a breaking point, where you feel you can’t keep coming to their rescue. If you feel your codependence is overwhelming, take steps to end the relationship . Express your worries clearly, and stand firm in your decision to leave."

      "title": "There’s addiction in the relationship.",
      "content": "There’s addiction in the relationship. Alcohol, drugs, sex. Whatever it is, you enable each other’s worst behaviors, making self-destruction easier than it’d be if you weren’t together. [9] X Research source In many ways, you feel as though you’re also addicted to each other—it’s not a healthy relationship, but you just can’t quit. If you or your partner have a damaging addiction, make steps to overcome it by visiting a counselor or an addiction support group."

      "title": "You don’t feel safe around your partner.",
      "content": "You don’t feel safe around your partner. Abuse comes in many forms, verbal or physical. And when you’re as close as you are to your karmic partner, it becomes all too easy to overlook or ignore. But lately, you feel uncomfortable or even unsafe in your partner’s presence. If you feel this way, talk to a trusted friend or family member, and make moves to exit the relationship as soon as possible. [10] X Research source While your karmic contract may be with this person, it doesn’t mean allowing yourself to be abused. Learn to recognize the signs of an abusive relationship . These include physical, verbal, or sexual assaults, but may also be more subtle, such as emotional manipulation."

      "title": "You start to notice the worst parts of yourself.",
      "content": "You start to notice the worst parts of yourself. Your partner is your karmic mirror, after all. Even as they bring out the best in you, they also bring out the worst, to the point where you can’t overlook your own bad behavior. [11] X Research source This is often the start of your own introspection; the relationship has begun to reveal the karmic issues you need to resolve. Take note of these issues by writing them down. Externalizing and embracing your flaws can help you make sense of your own negative behavioral patterns and start planning ways to break the cycle."

      "title": "You’re afraid of exiting the relationship.",
      "content": "You’re afraid of exiting the relationship. As hard as the relationship has become, you find the thought of calling things off as hard as the thought of keeping things going.

      "title": "You get the feeling you’re about to meet someone important.",
      "content": "You get the feeling you’re about to meet someone important. Either just before or just after meeting your karmic partner, your intuition will tell you that there’s about to be a significant shift. It comes as a gut feeling, or a sudden elevated mood.

      "title": "You have an immediate connection to your partner.",
      "content": "You have an immediate connection to your partner. Once you do connect with your karmic partner, it feels like the universe dropped them right in front of you like a gift.

      "content": "The relationship becomes unbalanced or one-sided. At the start, things are peachy. You understand each other, and seem to always be on the same wavelength.

Avoid toxic arguments by asking yourself if the cause matters, in the grand scheme of things, or if it’s over something you don’t actually feel strongly about. Also pay attention to these arguments.

      "content": "The patterns of negative behavior start to repeat. You seem to have the same argument over and over. Or your partner refuses to change their ways. In addition, you keep making the same mistakes, even when you know which mistakes to avoid.
