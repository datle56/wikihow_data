      "content": "Abnormally high temps are the classic sign a radiator is failing. If your temperature gauge on your dashboard is touching the yellow or red portion of the dial, your vehicle is too hot. On newer cars, you’ll see a little thermostat light pop on. Your radiator is the only thing keeping your vehicle from overheating, so if it isn’t doing its job that’s a big sign something is wrong. [1] X Research source If your dashboard displays exact temps, your vehicle should normally operate at 195–220 °F (91–104 °C). An overheating vehicle will often smoke, but that’s not always the case. Do not drive if your radiator is failing so badly that your car is overheating. Excessive heat can melt electrical components or permanently damage your engine."

      "title": "If the temperature dial randomly moves, it’s a bad sign.",
      "content": "If the temperature dial randomly moves, it’s a bad sign. The temperature dial in your vehicle rarely fails on its own, so it’s concerning if the dial moves up and down erratically. Look at it while you’re driving. If it moves back and forth rapidly, it might mean the fans attached to your radiator are starting to fail. [2] X Research source When it’s working correctly, your radiator should expel heat evenly and smoothly. As a result, that temperature dial should only ever move very slowly."

      "title": "A cracked radiator or hose will leak coolant.",
      "content": "A cracked radiator or hose will leak coolant. Look underneath your vehicle when it’s idling. If you see drips of any kind, something is leaking. The radiator expels heat, but running through the fins are hoses containing coolant, which absorb the heat from the engine. If coolant isn’t making its way to the radiator due to a cracked hose or damaged radiator, you’ll usually see it dripping. You should only need to add coolant every 2-5 years. If you find yourself refilling the coolant reservoir more often than that, it’s likely you have a leak."

      "title": "If you see bubbles when you take the radiator cap off, there’s a leak.",
      "content": "If you see bubbles when you take the radiator cap off, there’s a leak. Your radiator system is a closed loop, so nothing should be getting in or out. Take the radiator cap off and look at and inspect the fluid. If you see bubbles coming up, it means air is getting into your radiator system. This is a sign your radiator or one of the hoses is damaged. [3] X Research source You may even notice thin, empty bubbles appearing around the edge of the radiator cap when it’s on."

    {
      "title": "Your coolant tank’s level should remain constant.",
      "content": "Your coolant tank’s level should remain constant. Look on your coolant tank for the hash mark that indicates the proper level. If your coolant is low, fill it up to that hash mark. The next few days, check the tank again. If the levels are dropping (even a little bit!) there’s something going on with your radiator system. [4] X Research source The type of coolant you need depends on your engine and model—the specific coolant mixture is listed on the radiator cap."

    {
      "title": "If coolant spills out from the radiator cap, the cap is bad.",
      "content": "If coolant spills out from the radiator cap, the cap is bad. Your radiator cap should be 100% airtight. Coolant expands when it gets hot, so if the cap is damaged, the coolant will boil over the reservoir. You may notice weird antifreeze smells after you drive, and you’ll find yourself refilling the reservoir more often than you normally would. [5] X Research source If you ever see white smoke coming from your hood on a hot day while you’re driving, it’s the coolant spilling over and coming into contact with a hot component in your engine bay."

    {
      "title": "Brown coolant is a sign that it’s time to change your fluids.",
      "content": "Brown coolant is a sign that it’s time to change your fluids. Coolant should be some bright, fluorescent color—not brown. If your coolant is contaminated, the hoses are dirty, or the transmissions heat exchanger is damaged, your coolant will turn a sludgy brown color. Your entire system will need to be flushed so that a mechanic can identify the problem and re-seal the system. [6] X Research source Most of the time, coolant is bright green. However, it may be yellow, pink, red, or blue depending on the type of antifreeze used in the mixture."

      "title": "A sticky gear shift is a key sign the radiator is damaged.",
      "content": "A sticky gear shift is a key sign the radiator is damaged. In most modern vehicles, the transmission is integrated with your vehicle’s radiator system. So, if the radiator is messed up, the transmission—which is responsible for shifting gears—will also start to fail. In an automatic car, your vehicle may jump when the gears change, or you’ll notice engine stuttering when changing gears. [7] X Research source You’re probably going to notice your vehicle overheating before you notice any gear shifting issues if it’s hot outside."

      "title": "If your radiator is filthy it’s a signal the coolant might be leaking.",
      "content": "If your radiator is filthy it’s a signal the coolant might be leaking. This can be a sign of a failing radiator if the hose is leaking coolant fluid on the fins, but it might just be a buildup of dirt and mud. Try hosing down your radiator to see if the temperature issues resolve themselves. The radiator is always just behind the grill on your car, so just keep the hood down and hose the front of your vehicle."

    {
      "title": "Take a look at the radiator and inspect it for imperfections.",
      "content": "Take a look at the radiator and inspect it for imperfections. Grab a flashlight and look at the radiator behind your grill (you can see it between the seams). If you see any bent fins or there are gouges missing from your radiator, it needs to be replaced. Once a radiator is damaged enough to the point that it impacts your vehicle performance, you can’t physically repair it. The entire set of fins needs to be swapped out. This can be caused by rocks kicking up into your grill, accidents, or general wear and tear over the years."
