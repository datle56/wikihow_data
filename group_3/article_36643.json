      "content": "Pull the key out with pliers if you can see part of it. If the key didn’t break off deep within the ignition and you can see the edge of the key, Fago recommends using pliers. He says, “If the break was really shallow and there is a part of the key that can be grasped on to, use needle nose pliers. The thinner, the better. You can also use surgical tools to grab onto the key and pull it out if you have them.” Fago points out that you may need to turn the key to move the ignition to the “off” position first if the key broke while you were turning it. If you can’t turn the key in the ignition, see a professional to have them disassemble the cover and turn the pins."

      "content": "Use a thin, stiff wire to pull the key out if you can’t see the edge. Fago says that if you can’t grab the edge of the broken key, use a wire to wedge the key out. Try sliding a paper clip or length of wire hanger in between the bottom of the key and the ignition cylinder. Jiggle the wire gently while trying to tug on the key to see if you can work it out far enough to grab it with some pliers. If you aren’t in a rush, buy a key-extracting tool . These devices slide in the ignition and grip the key safely to remove it. Struggling to get any leverage? Fago explains that this isn’t always doable for a DIY-er. “Pros use micro tools to grab onto broken keys and pull them out safely. It’s a pretty specialized job. If you can’t get the key out on your own, see a mechanic."

There’s a popular hack for broken keys where you take the broken portion that’s free, put a bit of glue on the edge, and stick it in your ignition to grab the broken part.
