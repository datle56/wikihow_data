If you're greeting someone you don't already know, start with a formal greeting – especially if they're older than you, or in a position of authority. [1] X Research source If you don't know how to roll your \"R\"s , you may want to practice. Place your tongue to the back of your upper teeth and vibrate it as you make the R sound. Zdravstvujtye is also used to greet a group of people, even if you're talking to a group of children, or to friends and family. Shorten your greeting to zdravstvuj (zdrah-stvooy) if you're greeting friends, family members, or children."

This word is equivalent to the English \"hi,\" but is only used in casual, informal situations where you know the person you're greeting fairly well. You can use it with friends and family, but it isn't appropriate with strangers, especially if they are older than you or in a position of authority. [2] X Research source Privetik (pree-vyet-ick) is an even less formal, almost cutesy way of saying \"hi,\" more typically used by young women."

Apart from saying \"hello,\" you may find it more appropriate to say \"good morning\" or \"good evening.\" These phrases do not have formal and informal versions. If you're not sure whether to address someone formally or informally, these phrases come in handy. [3] X Research source Dobroye utro! (dohb-ruh-ee oo-truh) means \"good morning!\" Use it until around noon. After noon, switch to dobryj dyen’! (dohb-rihy dyen’) This means \"good afternoon,\" but can be used most of the day, except early in the morning or late at night. Later in the evening, use dobryj vyechyer! (dohb–rihy vye-cheer) to say \"good evening.\""

It's typically used in more informal settings, but you probably won't offend anyone by using it. [4] X Research source In a more formal setting, ask Kak vy pozhivayetye? (kahk vih puh-zhih-vah-ee-tee). This is appropriate when talking to someone you just met, especially if they are older than you or in a position of authority."

More common responses are khorosho (khuh-rah-shoh), which means \"good,\" or nyeplokho (nee-ploh-khuh), which means \"not bad.\" [5] X Research source If the other person asks you how you're doing first, follow your answer with A u vas? (ah oo vahs; formal) or A u tyebya? (ah oo tee-bya; informal), both of which mean \"And you?\""

Don't worry about trying to translate the name of your country or city into Russian – native speakers likely will recognize it. To ask where the other person is from, use the question otkuda vy if speaking formally, or otkuda ty if speaking informally."

This phrase doesn't necessarily mean you're going to bed. Use it later in the evening. Spokojnoj nochi (spah-kohy-nuhy noh-chee) also means \"good night.\" This phrase is appropriate if you are turning in for the evening, or going to bed.
