      "content": "Source garlic from a local nursery or grower. You'll have the best chance at a successful crop if you buy garlic cloves from a plant nursery that stocks varieties that grow well in your area. Or, if you know someone in your area who grows garlic, ask them if they’ll share a head of garlic so you can grow the cloves. [1] X Research source Garlic sold in grocery stores has usually been treated with chemicals to keep it from sprouting, which helps it last longer on the shelf. It's harder to grow treated garlic than untreated garlic. The garlic stocked in grocery stores may not be a strain that works with your climate and soil type. You can also order garlic bulbs online—just choose a variety that’s suited for your climate and USDA hardiness zone. Check out our section on the different types of garlic if you’re not sure what kind to plant in your area."

      "content": "Plant in the fall for the best harvest. If you live somewhere that gets frosts in the winter, your garlic will grow best if you plant it in the fall—you’ll get bigger bulbs and a hardier harvest. Garlic needs to be kept below 40 °F (4 °C) for 6–8 weeks in order to thrive in the spring. This process is called vernalization. Try to plant the garlic about 1–2 weeks after your first frost. [2] X Research source Plant garlic in the spring if: Your area doesn’t get frosts (Zone 10+), your ground stays really wet and muddy through the winter, or you missed your window to plant in the fall. If you’re planting in the spring: Buy bulbs labeled for spring planting or put your garlic bulbs in the fridge for 6–8 weeks to overwinter them. Plant the garlic once temperatures warm up and the soil is workable, usually around February or March."

      "content": "Choose a spot with full sun and well-draining soil. Garlic likes loose soil, so before you plant, work the soil down about 4 in (10 cm) with a garden rake or hoe. Enrich the soil with compost to add nutrients that will help the garlic grow strong and healthy. [3] X Research source If your yard tends to stay soggy through the winter : Consider planting the garlic in a raised bed instead of directly in the ground. Raised beds will provide better drainage and improve your garlic harvest. If you’d like, you can mix in bone meal , fish meal , or a 5-10-10 NPK fertilizer to enrich the soil. [4] X Research source Garlic prefers soil between 6.0 and 7.0 pH. Test the pH of your soil. If you need to lower the pH—or acidify the soil —mix in compost, manure, or an ammonia-based fertilizer . If you need to raise the pH , mix in wood ash or a lime product like dolomite lime or hydrated lime ."

      "content": "Grow the garlic in a container if you don’t have a good outdoor space. If you don’t have a garden or raised bed, growing garlic in pots can be a fun project. Choose a pot that’s around 6 in (15 cm) across. Fill the container with rich potting soil . Plant the garlic clove with the flat side down and the pointed end up about 2 in (5.1 cm) deep. Be sure to choose a pot with drainage holes—if the water doesn’t drain out, the garlic will rot."

Be sure to place each clove with the flat end down and the pointed end up—the roots will emerge from the flat end and the shoots will come from the pointed end. [7] X Research source There are two methods for planting: Dig a trench 2–3 in (5.1–7.6 cm) deep, place the cloves into the trench, and loosely fill in the trench with soil. Place each clove in a hole that’s 2–3 in (5.1–7.6 cm) deep, then loosely fill in the hole."

This will help the garden bed warm up faster, which will allow the garlic to start putting out shoots. [10] X Research source Some people prefer to leave the mulch in place to help prevent weeds. Alternatively, you can remove the mulch in spring, lightly stir up the top of the soil, then reapply the mulch to help control weeds."

When the top 1 in (2.5 cm) of soil has dried out, water again. [11] X Research source You may need to water more often if your garden has particularly sandy soil, as it won’t hold water well. Only water the garlic if the soil has dried out. If your area gets a lot of rain in spring and summer, you may not need to water the garlic much. [12] X Trustworthy Source University of Georgia Cooperative Extension Division of the University of Georgia focused on research and community education Go to source Try to water in the morning so the soil can drain thoroughly by night.

Cut off any scapes you see—if they're left on the plant, they’ll flower. This will take energy away from the bulb formation and result in smaller bulbs. Garlic scapes are considered a delicacy—try adding them to a dish in place of green onions or chives."

At the end of the growing season, in late June or early July, the tops of the garlic plants will start looking yellow and begin to fall over and die. Once the top 1/3 to 1/2 of the plant has died, it's time to harvest the garlic. [16] X Research source If you’re not sure whether the garlic is ready, dig up one bulb and cut it in half. If the garlic cloves fill up the outer skin, it’s time to harvest the crop. Don't harvest the garlic too late in the season—the bulbs will shrivel and the garlic won't be good to eat.

During this time, the skin will dry and the bulb will become firm. [18] X Research source You can cut off the stems and cure the garlic bulbs individually in a storage bin. Make sure they get plenty of air circulation. Another common way to cure and store garlic is to leave the stems attached and braid them, then hang the garlic in a cool, dry place. You can also cure your garlic by hanging the cloves upside down in a warm, shaded area with the leaves attached. Use the garlic when the skin is dry and papery. The cloves should be firm to the touch and easy to pull apart."
