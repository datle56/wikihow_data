      "title": "Search for the Milky Way between June and August.",
      "content": "Search for the Milky Way between June and August. This will be summer in the northern hemisphere and winter in the southern hemisphere. These months are the best to view the Milky Way because it is not as close to the sun. [1] X Research source You may be able to see parts of the Milky Way as early as March or as late as August. Between November and February, however, it is not visible. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Start stargazing two hours after sunset and before dawn.",
      "content": "Start stargazing two hours after sunset and before dawn. The hours just after sunset and before sunrise are still very bright. Wait at least two hours after the sun has set before you go out stargazing. [3] X Research source You can use an almanac or a weather website to learn when sunset and sunrise will happen on any particular day. Use this to plan your trip."

      "title": "Find a location that has no light pollution.",
      "content": "Find a location that has no light pollution. Light from buildings, streets, and cars can block your view. Try to find a rural site that is far away from any towns, houses, or major roads. [4] X Research source Since the Milky Way appears in the southern sky, you should travel south of any major cities. If you do this, the light from the city will not interfere with your viewing of the Milky Way. Nature reserves, mountains, deserts, and other unsettled areas are great places to view the Milky Way. To find dark areas, you can use a light pollution map, such as this one: http://www.youcanseethemilkyway.com/light-pollution/ ."

      "title": "Pick a moonless and cloudless night.",
      "content": "Pick a moonless and cloudless night. You may not be able to see the Milky Way if the moon is too bright or if clouds are blocking the sky. Before going out to see the Milky Way, pick a clear night with either a new moon or a crescent moon. [5] X Research source Most weather services will tell you both how many clouds there will be as well as what phase the moon is in. Several apps, such as Luna Solaria or Moon Phase Plus, will tell you what phase the moon is in."

      "title": "Let your eyes adapt for 20 minutes.",
      "content": "Let your eyes adapt for 20 minutes. During this time, do not use a flashlight, phone, or another source of light. Your eyes need time to adjust to the darkness before you can see stars. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Avoid going too far north.",
      "content": "Avoid going too far north. Above a latitude of 50° north, it will be difficult to see the Milky Way. This latitude includes anything north of Normandy, France; Vancouver, Canada; and Inner Mongolia, China. Travel south for the best view. [7] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Look to the south.",
      "content": "Look to the south. Use a compass or an app on your phone to point you to the south. If you are viewing the Milky Way in summer, you should see the first bands rising from the south. It will look like a white cloud of stars or a dense, misty cluster across the sky. [8] X Research source If you’re viewing the Milky Way in spring, turn slightly to the west. If it’s autumn, look slightly to the east. [9] X Research source Keep in mind that the Milky Way will not look like any pictures you may have seen of it. Cameras are able to pick up more light and colors than a human eye."

      "content": "Focus near the horizon to see the core of the galaxy. Look for the densest cluster of stars; this will be the core. If you are very far north, the core may be partially covered by the horizon. If you are closer to the equator, it may be up above the horizon. [10] X Research source"

      "content": "Pick out the Great Rift by searching for dark patches. In the core of the Milky Way, you may see some dark patches. These may only be visible in the darkest skies. This is called the Great Rift. It is a series of thick clouds covering part of the Milky Way. [11] X Research source"

      "title": "Visit an area that is around -30° latitude.",
      "content": "Visit an area that is around -30° latitude. You will have a better view of the Milky Way in the southern parts of the southern hemisphere. This includes places like North Cape, South Africa; Coquimbo Region, Chile; and New South Wales, Australia. You can still see the Milky Way in other parts of the southern hemisphere, but this will give you the largest view of the galaxy."

      "title": "Face southwest to see the bands.",
      "content": "Face southwest to see the bands. The bands of the Milky Way will start in the southwestern sky and will sweep along the horizon to the northeast. You can use a compass to help you find the southwestern horizon. [12] X Research source"

      "title": "Look straight up above you to see the core.",
      "content": "Look straight up above you to see the core. The center of the Milky Way will be just above your head. Lean back your head to see it. It will look like a foggy, white cloud of stars. [13] X Research source Consider taking a blanket with you so that you can lie down and gaze at the Milky Way."

      "title": "Search for dark spaces to find the Great Rift.",
      "content": "Search for dark spaces to find the Great Rift. The Great Rift is more apparent in the southern hemisphere, since the Milky Way is brighter. It will look like dark streaks cutting through the stars. [14] X Research source"

      "content": "Bring a star chart to find constellations. Which constellations you can see depends on your latitude and season. A star chart can tell you what you can find. Look for one that is designed for your location and time of year. [15] X Research source Some common constellations found near the Milky Way include Sagittarius, Alpha Centauri, Cygnus, and the Magellanic Clouds. You can buy a star chart at a planetarium, science museum, or online. You can also get apps, like Stellarium or SkyGuide, that will download star charts to your phone automatically."

      "title": "Use binoculars or a telescope for a closer view.",
      "content": "Use binoculars or a telescope for a closer view. Find the Milky Way with your naked eye first and point the lens towards it. Then look through the viewer to see individual stars and galaxies up close. [16] X Research source Any size of binoculars or telescope will work. With a higher magnification or aperture, you will be able to see more detail, but you can still pick out individual stars with a low magnification."

      "title": "Take a long-exposure photograph",
      "content": "Take a long-exposure photograph with a digital camera. A photograph will capture the galaxy's magnificent colors and stars. To get a good picture, change the settings in your camera to a long exposure. Attach the widest lens you have. For the best results, place the camera on a tripod. Point the lens so that you have the widest view of the sky as possible before taking the picture. [17] X Research source If you can, adjust the shutter speed based on the size of your lens. Divide 500 by the diameter of your lens. Use the result to set the shutter speed. For example, if your lens is 25mm, then you should set your shutter speed to 20 seconds. You may need to adjust the contrast later to get the best results."
