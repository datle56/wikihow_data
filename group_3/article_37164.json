      "content": "If you suspect the car doesn't have a valid MOT, you can check online. Go to https://www.gov.uk/check-mot-status and click the green button to get started. You must have the registration number (number plate) for the vehicle. There's not really any outward sign that a car doesn't have an MOT, but if you see someone driving a car that appears to be unsafe, it's possible that it doesn't have an MOT."

Technically, a car without an MOT can only be driven to the testing station to get an MOT if the driver has an appointment there. If it's parked in a garage and you have no evidence that it's being driven on the roads, though, there's no cause to report it. [2] X Trustworthy Source Official UK government website Official website for the public sector of the UK government Go to source Cars without an MOT can't be parked on the road either. If you see a car without an MOT and it's not in a private driveway or garage, you can report it."

Go to https://www.police.uk/pu/contact-the-police/ to find the local police force that's responsible for the area where the car is located. It's typically easiest to report the vehicle online, but you can also call the police non-emergency number. [3] X Trustworthy Source Official UK government website Official website for the public sector of the UK government Go to source The police don't handle abandoned vehicles. If you feel the vehicle is abandoned (for example, if it doesn't have any number plates or doesn't appear drivable), report it to the local council. In England and Wales, you can do this online at https://www.gov.uk/report-abandoned-vehicle . If the car is on private property, notify the owner of the property and let them deal with it. For example, if a car without an MOT is parked in the designated lot for your apartment building, you'd notify your landlord rather than the police. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Yes, most police forces allow you to report anonymously. You might need to call 101 (police non-emergency) to report the car. While you can also report the car online, some police forces don't allow anonymous reports online. For example, if you want to file an online report for a car without an MOT in Dorset, you're required to provide your full name, birth date, address, and contact information (phone number and email address)."

If they find that the car is being operated illegally, they'll cite the owner with a fine. The maximum fine for operating a car with no MOT is £1,000. The vehicle might also be towed away if it's blocking the road, parked in a restricted area, or inoperable.
