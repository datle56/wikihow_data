      "content": "Gather at least nine slime blocks. In Minecraft, slime blocks have a slight \"bouncy\" effect when you jump on them. On top of this, you don't receive any falling damage from landing on them — no matter how high you fall from. [1] X Research source This makes them perfect for making a trampoline! Since you'll want to make a trampoline that's big enough to hit when you're falling from a great height, you'll probably want at least nine before you get started. Slime blocks are crafted from nine slimeballs at the crafting table. [2] X Research source You can get slimeballs by killing slime mobs, which tend to appear underground and in swamps.

      "title": "Arrange the slime blocks in a wide, flat pad.",
      "content": "Arrange the slime blocks in a wide, flat pad. Make a square or circle with the slime blocks. Keep it one layer thick — multiple layers won't change the properties of the trampoline. This will be the \"bouncy\" surface of the trampoline that you'll jump on to. If you wish, you can just put this pad on the floor. However, if you're going for a realistic-looking trampoline, you may want to make a frame of wood, stone, or metal a few blocks off of the floor. Putting a ladder on one side is a nice touch."

      "title": "Build a tower next to your trampoline to jump off.",
      "content": "Build a tower next to your trampoline to jump off. Use whatever spare blocks you have to build your skinny tower — stone and wood work fine. There's no \"right\" height, but the higher you jump from, the more you'll bounce. Unless you want to build a system of stairs, a ladder will be a huge help for getting to the top again once you jump. Craft ladders by arranging seven wood sticks in an \"H\" shape at a crafting table. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Make a sticky piston. For this method, which makes a trampoline that automatically shoots you up, you'll need a sticky piston block. You can make this from a slime ball and a normal piston. [5] X Research source To make a normal piston, craft it from the following at a crafting table: [6] X Research source Top row: Three wood planks Middle row: Cobblestone, iron ingot, cobblestone Bottom row: Cobblestone, redstone, cobblestone"

      "title": "Position the sticky piston under a pad of slime blocks.",
      "content": "Position the sticky piston under a pad of slime blocks. Place the sticky piston facing up. On top of it, build a flat layer of slime blocks. You'll probably want at least a 3x3 square so that you can land on the trampoline easily. Note: If you're giving your trampoline a frame, be sure to make it out of obsidian. Most other building materials will stick to the slime when the piston moves it up."

Make a two-block high wall on opposite sides of the trampoline. Put a row of tripwire hooks on the inside of each wall facing each other. You can craft a tripwire hook by arranging an iron ingot above a wooden stick above a wooden plank at a crafting table. [7] X Research source"

You should now have a set of tripwires that completely cover the trampoline. To get to the trampoline, you should be forced to touch the tripwire. You can get string from killing spiders or by mining it from tripwire traps in the game. [8] X Research source"

      "title": "Link the switches to the sticky piston with a redstone circuit.",
      "content": "Link the switches to the sticky piston with a redstone circuit. This is the tricky part. You need to connect the piston to the tripwire trap so that when you touch the strings, the piston will shoot you upwards. First, wire the string traps to the ground with redstone. Redstone can move up and down one block at a time, so you may need to make \"stairs\" to get it to ground level."

      "content": "Make a side circuit with a repeater. This circuit should start in front of the comparator (on the same side as the piston) and connect to the comparator from the side. Put a redstone repeater in the middle of this circuit. The front of the repeater should face toward the piston. See this helpful video for a good visual guide. This article on comparators and this article on repeaters may also be of assistance. [9] X Research source [10] X Research source"

      "title": "Step onto the trampoline.",
      "content": "Step onto the trampoline. Now, if everything is wired correctly, when you move onto the trampoline, you'll trigger the tripwire, which will activate the piston. The piston will push the slime blocks up, shooting you into the air. The repeater in the circuit will cause the piston to keep firing, sending you up again and again. Congratulations! You've built an automatic trampoline. Try putting a small pool of water (or some slime blocks without a sticky piston) just to the side of the trampoline. You can fall into this when you want to get off."
