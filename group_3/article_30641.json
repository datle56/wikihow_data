      "title": "Place the sample in between 2 plates of metal.",
      "content": "Place the sample in between 2 plates of metal. The best way to measure a steady-state sample is with the hot plate method. If your sample is flat and mostly rectangular, place it between 2 metal plates in the lab. Make sure you have enough space to cool and heat each plate. [2] X Research source Steady-state material does not change even when it goes through a transformation or change. If you add a change-agent to a chemical mix but it retains its properties, it is a steady-state material."

      "content": "Heat the top plate and cool the bottom plate until the temperatures are steady. Use a heating apparatus to heat the top plate and a cooling apparatus to cool the bottom plate. You can set a certain temperature for each plate or just monitor them to see what temperature they arrive at. It could take up to 10 minutes for your temperatures to become steady.

      "content": "Monitor the amount of heat passing through the sample. Thermal conductivity is the amount of heat that is lost over time. Use a thermometer to measure the amount of heat passing through the sample from the warm side to the cool side to get your thermal conductivity constant. Plug this into your thermal conductivity equation. [4] X Research source Put your thermometer in an unobtrusive area of your sample."

      "content": "Apply Searle’s bar method for a steady-state sample in tube form. Use a Searle’s bar apparatus to test the rate of thermal conductivity if your sample is in a pipe, like copper. Put your sample into the center of the apparatus. Place the steam end of the apparatus into a sink. Adjust the head of the apparatus to ensure a steady flow of water over your sample. Measure the temperature of the water as it exits the apparatus."

      "content": "Test a small, thin sample with a parallel thermal conductance. Thin samples can’t handle as much pressure as thick, cylindrical samples can. Place your sample on a stage in between a heat source and a heat sink. Measure the heat lost over time. Then, measure the stage to test its thermal conductivity. Subtract the stage’s conductivity from the sample’s conductivity. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Insert a hot wire into the middle of your sample. Nonsteady-state samples are much more likely to be foams or gels that can have a wire inserted into them. Heat a wire and note the temperature that it starts at. Insert the wire into the middle of your sample where it is the thickest. [6] X Research source The wire is fairly intrusive, so it can’t be used on solid samples. Nonsteady-state materials do change when they go through a transformation or change."

In order to measure thermal conductivity, you need to account for all variables that could affect heat loss or gain. Time, thickness of the sample, thermal conduction constant, and temperature of the test are all taken into account when solving for thermal conductivity. [10] X Research source In the equation, “Q” stands for the amount of heat transferred over time, or the thermal conductivity. “t” denotes the change in time. ”k” denotes the thermal conductivity constant. ”A” denotes the cross section of the sample that is conducting heat. ”T” is the difference in temperature from the cold side of the sample to the hot side of the sample. ”d” denotes the thickness of the sample."

If your time is in minutes, multiply the minutes by 60 to get seconds. If your time is in hours, multiply the time by 3600 to get seconds. Plug your seconds into the “T” of the equation. [12] X Research source For example, if you have 30 minutes, take 30 x 60 = 1800 seconds. If you have 1 hour, multiply 1 x 3600 = 3600 seconds. Your equation should read: Q = (3600 s)kAT / d"
