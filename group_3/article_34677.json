      "title": "Soften the skin with hot water.",
      "content": "Soften the skin with hot water. Most wart removal methods require you to soften the skin around the wart before applying any other treatment. This makes the calloused area easier to remove. Start by soaking the wart and surrounding areas in a hot water bath for ten to fifteen minutes prior to removal. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Buff the wart.",
      "content": "Buff the wart. While the calloused skin surrounding the wart is still soft from soaking, use a pumice stone or another abrasive surface like an emery board to file down the dead skin. [3] X Expert Source Diana Yerkes Skincare Professional Expert Interview. 16 April 2019. Use a gentle scrubbing or back-and-forth motion to take off the top, whitish layer of skin. [4] X Research source Do not pumice too hard or too much. The pumice should not hurt, and you should stop once you buff away the dead skin. Stop if you feel any pain, irritation, or discomfort. Do not share a pumice stone with others, as this could lead to infection."

      "title": "Apply an acid treatment.",
      "content": "Apply an acid treatment. Pumicing, alone, will not get rid of a wart. After pumicing, apply a salicylic acid treatment formulated especially for wart removal. These are available over the counter in both liquid and patch form from most pharmacies and drug stores. [5] X Research source If you use a liquid treatment, you may opt to apply a bandage after you apply the treatment to keep the area covered and the acid contained."

      "title": "Repeat treatment until the wart is gone.",
      "content": "Repeat treatment until the wart is gone. Treating a wart by pumicing and applying acid can take time. Repeat the treatment daily until the wart has disappeared. If the wart is not gone after 12 weeks, contact your doctor to see if continuing treatment is advised. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Soak your skin for ten to fifteen minutes.",
      "content": "Soak your skin for ten to fifteen minutes. Just as with any other wart treatment, you will want to soak the thick, hardened skin around the wart in hot water for up to fifteen minutes. Allow the tissue to soften so that it is more readily removed with the pumice stone. Towel dry the wart before using the stone.

[8] X Expert Source Diana Yerkes Skincare Professional Expert Interview. 16 April 2019. Do not press too hard, as this could cause cracking and infection.

      "content": "Cover the wart with duct tape. There is no medical proof that duct tape is an effective treatment for warts, but many claim to have great success with this home remedy. After pumicing the wart, cover it with a small piece of duct tape. Change out the tape every six or so days to peel away the wart a few layers at a time. [11] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Dermatology Professional organization made of over 20,000 certified dermatologists Go to source Repeat the soaking and pumicing process every time you change out the duct tape. Continue this process for no more than two months. If the treatment is not working, try another over the counter treatment, or contact your doctor for further care instructions."
