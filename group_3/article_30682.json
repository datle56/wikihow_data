      "content": "Get a friend and a flexible measuring tape to measure your sleeve length. You will need someone to measure your arm length for you while you stand still. Use a vinyl tailor’s measuring tape that will follow the contours of your arm, not one of the metal tape measures that are typically used for construction or household projects. You can buy a vinyl measuring tape at a sewing store or order one online. If you don’t have a flexible tape measure, you can use a piece of string and then measure the length of it with a regular metal tape measure or ruler.

[3] X Expert Source Mia Danilowicz Master Tailor Expert Interview. 8 January 2021. If you measure your arm without slightly bending it you may end up with a sleeve that is too short and uncomfortable.

      "content": "Measure from the middle of the back of your neck to your wrist. Have your friend hold the measuring tape at the back of your neck, and lay it along the top of your shoulder and down the outside of your bent arm down to your wrist where you want your shirt cuff to hang. Read the tape measure to determine your sleeve length. Make sure the tape measure lays flat on the outside of your arm and goes straight down to your wrist to get the correct sleeve length measurement. If you're measuring the length for a sleeve that you're sewing, start measuring at the top of the shoulder, then go down around the elbow to the wrist bone.

      "content": "Record the measurement you got to the nearest 1/4 inch (0.6 cm). Round down or up as you normally would. Take this measurement with you when you shop for new dress shirts. [6] X Research source For suit jacket sleeves, subtract an additional 1/2 inch (1.3 cm) so the sleeve will be the correct length and allow your shirt cuff to pop out from underneath. Always try on shirts when you go shopping, even though you have your measurements, as different brands and types of shirts can fit differently."

Smooth the sleeve out to the side as flat as you can. [7] X Research source If you are right-handed, measure the right sleeve. If you are left-handed, measure the left sleeve. Make sure to measure a shirt that fits you well so that you get proper measurements that you can use to buy dress shirts."
