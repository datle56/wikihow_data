      "title": "Mars in Aries can be volatile and easily angered.",
      "content": "Mars in Aries can be volatile and easily angered. Every zodiac sign and Mars placement has its weaknesses, and the same is true for Mars in Aries. For all their energy and inner fire, Mars in Aries can sometimes be a little too forceful or reckless, which can affect their work and personal relationships. Weaknesses include being: Impulsive. As one of the zodiac’s cardinal signs, Aries is a “doer.” That’s why Mars in Aries is so quick to act—but sometimes they act without considering the negative consequences of their actions. Aggressive. Mars represents aggression (among other things) and it’s the ruler of Aries. That means a Mars in Aries can be argumentative when they feel they’re right and may insult others without meaning to. Self-centered. Mars in Aries is all about self-fulfillment, which isn’t always a bad thing, but it can cause them to neglect their loved ones and relationships at times."

      "content": "Open yourself up to other people’s perspectives. As the first sign in the zodiac, Aries has a very “me-first” mentality. So, if you’re a Mars in Aries, you likely know what you want and are determined to get it—but by focusing solely on yourself, you might be limiting your growth. Instead, listen to other people’s suggestions and input, and consider their ideas, too. [4] X Research source Remember, you don’t have to do everything yourself. Someone else might have great advice for you, but only if you’re open to hearing it. Other people’s ideas can benefit you, too, so don’t always let your ego take the reins. Let others help and guide you sometimes."

      "content": "Mars in Aries transits often feel like a compelling call to action. Mars crosses through a new zodiac sign every 45 days during its orbit around the sun, and a Mars in Aries transit occurs when Mars moves through the sign of Aries. Because Mars rules Aries, the two work together perfectly. During transits, you’ll likely feel motivated, confident, and ready to face any challenge (regardless of your Sun sign or Mars placement). Mars in Aries transits are the time to take action and achieve your goals , so don’t wait around for things to happen. Seize the day and keep moving forward. During these transits, you may feel like a fire has been lit under you, giving you a powerful surge of energy (and impulsivity). However, you may also be a bit more temperamental and quick to anger; Aries is a fire sign, after all! Remember that it’s still important to cooperate with others and compromise , even with all that forceful Aries energy driving you."
