      "title": "Download your game",
      "content": "Download your game . The very first thing you need to do if you want to play Minecraft on the PC is obviously to buy and download it. Minecraft comes down to about twenty five U.S dollars and can be downloaded from the official Minecraft site Minecraft.net with no additional payments once bought. To buy Minecraft, click the yellow Get Minecraft button on the home page and create a Mojang account. Minecraft free trials are available to PC users. You can also download a demo version by registering for an account and downloading the launcher before buying the game. You can then play a demo version of the game for 100 minutes over a maximum period of 5 days."

      "title": "Familiarize yourself with the controls.",
      "content": "Familiarize yourself with the controls. One of the most aggravating things to have to figure out about Minecraft are the controls- not to mention the fact that they have the potential to change with each update. These controls can be changed from the settings menu, but the default controls that you'll want to know on the PC version of Minecraft are as follows: WASD keys: The WASD keys are used for movement in Minecraft and double tapping W is used for sprinting. W goes forward, S goes backwards, A goes left and D goes right. These controls can take some getting used to if you've only ever used your arrow keys, but are easier to use then arrow keys once you get used to them. E : opens your inventory. Double tapping W : makes your player sprint. This makes you go faster then pressing W once. Note that this will use a lot more energy and your hunger bar (yes, you have a hunger bar) will go down quicker. LM button: The LM button or 'left mouse button' is used to click and drag objects around your inventory, attack creatures and, perhaps the most important thing of all, to break blocks. RM button: he RM Button or 'right mouse button' is used to place blocks and can be used in some shortcuts when dragging blocks around your inventory. It is also used to activate blocks such as TNT, furnaces, doors, crafting tables and more as well as being used to eat when you are holding a food item. If you use the RM button while holding a sword, you can use it to block. Numbers/Mouse Scroller: The numbers and mouse scroller are used to select items in your hotbar. Shift : Shift is used to crouch. If you use it near an edge, you will not fall off. This will also hide your nametag that is above your head from other players. Space Bar: pace bar is used for jumping. In water, it is also used for swimming to the top. Esc : This pulls up the main menu. If you accidentally pressed esc , then click on the Back to Game option on the bottom. Also, if you pressed this button and you are the only player on the world, it pauses everything. This is not true if you are playing on a server or on a LAN server. Q : This button is for dropping any items you don't want, or giving it to other players."

      "content": "Start with wood. To gather wood, you hold down your left mouse button on the trunk of any tree and wait for it to break. You then collect the block. If you have an axe, you can use your number keys or mouse scroller to scroll to that tool and harvest the wood a little faster. (or a lot faster, depending on what axe you have)."

Click on this single box until you have as many planks as you want, and then arrange four of these planks in a square in the same box of four and collect the crafting table you make."
