Massage the product down to your tips. [2] X Research source For a natural deep conditioner, use an emollient—softening—base, like one with shea butter, honey, or avocado."

Sub-divide that section into 3 pieces. Fold the piece on the right over the center piece. Then fold the piece on the left over the center piece. Fold the piece on the right (which was the original center piece) over the new piece in the center. Keep repeating this method until you reach the tips of your hair, and secure this braid with the clip. [5] X Research source If you prefer, you can do two-strand twists instead of traditional 3-part braids, but that will require you to divide your hair into more sections than for braiding."

[11] X Research source You want to make sure that the wrap will not fall off during the night. You also want to be comfortable for sleeping. Try to place the knot in a location where it won’t bother you while you sleep (e.g., tie it at the front if you sleep on your back or in the back if you sleep on your stomach)."
