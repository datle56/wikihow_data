The way the coins land will determine whether or not Sara Sarita allows you to continue the game. [2] X Research source If both coins land on heads , the answer is “yes.” Continue with the game. If both coins land on tails , the answer is “no.” Apologize and end the game immediately. If one coin lands on heads and the other lands on tails , the answer is “maybe.” Try asking again until you receive a clear answer."

As usual, toss the coins over your shoulder to get your answer. Only end the game if you get a yes. If you get a no or a maybe, keep asking until Sara Sarita agrees to let you leave. [4] X Research source It may take a while to end the game properly, but it is important to do so. Some players have reported scary experiences if they quit before getting a yes. One legend even says that several children in Mexico were put into mental asylums because they didn’t end the game properly. Some sources advise you to hold onto the coins and be careful not to lose or spend them after you finish the game. Some players report feeling a presence behind them even when they’ve successfully left the game. Others notice the sudden presence of a black dog in their life."

      "content": "Sara Sarita comes from a Mexican legend about two murdered girls. According to the main legend of Sara Sarita, Sara and Sarita were two sisters who went to school in Mexico. They both wore matching coins on a chain around their necks. One day, the girls stayed behind after school. One of the girls went into the bathroom and was followed by a creepy janitor. He killed the girl, and when her sister went to check on her, he killed her as well. The janitor fled, and when the police arrived, they assumed the girls had gotten into an argument and ruled their deaths a murder-suicide. The janitor was never caught. The girls’ broken chains were found on the floor, with one coin on heads and the other tails."
