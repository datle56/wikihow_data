      "content": "Check the weather before you start packing. Even if you won't be traveling for a few weeks or months, you can check the average highs and lows to help you anticipate your wardrobe needs as you prepare. [1] X Research source If you live somewhere warm and will be traveling somewhere cooler, do you need to invest in a jacket? Or vice versaâ€”do you live somewhere cool but will be traveling to a hot destination? You may need to purchase shorts or sandals so you will be comfortable while you travel."

      "title": "Establish your planned activities.",
      "content": "Establish your planned activities. Will you be sightseeing, lounging at the beach, going out on the town, or visiting museums? Having an idea in mind of what each day is going to look like while you are on vacation will help you plan what you are going to pack. [2] X Research source For example, if you are planning on staying at a remote cabin for a week, you probably don't need to bring a dressy outfit for a night out. Make a list of all planned activities and write down what kind of outfit you will need. If you are packing for a family, it's helpful to make a list for each person you're packing for so you don't forget anything."

      "title": "Coordinate your wardrobe to avoid overpacking.",
      "content": "Coordinate your wardrobe to avoid overpacking. Only pack clothes that can be worn with the rest of your wardrobe. It helps to lay out outfits on your bed to make sure things go together. If you want to pack your favorite skirt but aren't bringing a top or shoes you could pair it with, you won't end up wearing the skirt, so leave it behind. Similarly, if you bring ties or dress shoes, make sure they coordinate with your shirts and pants. [3] X Research source If you pack a jacket or blazer, make sure it coordinates with all the shirts you are bringing. Be mindful when packing accessories, too. Pick colors and designs that will work all your outfits. Don't forget to think about the kind of footwear you will need. For hiking you will need a pair of sturdy boots. For the beach, you'll want flip-flops. If you need dress shoes for fancier events, take those into account, too."

      "title": "Bring the necessary toiletries on your trip.",
      "content": "Bring the necessary toiletries on your trip. Items to remember include: deodorant, toothbrush/toothpaste, shampoo/conditioner, body wash, face lotion, face wash, hairbrush, styling products, contact lens case/solution, hand sanitizer, razor/shaving cream, period products, and lip balm. [4] X Research source Try to get as many items as you can in travel-sized containers. Local drugstores offer mini versions of commonly used toiletries, or you can buy your own travel-sized containers and fill them yourself. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Pack enough clothes to last you the week.",
      "content": "Pack enough clothes to last you the week. For a 5 day vacation, you will want to bring 2-3 pairs of shorts or pants, 3-4 tops, a light jacket (or a heavy jacket, depending on where you are traveling), and 1 formal outfit if you are planning on attending a nice restaurant or event. If you are going to the beach, pack 2-3 swimsuits/trunks. [6] X Research source Try to coordinate all clothing items so they can be worn with each other in any combination."

      "title": "Remember to bring clothes to sleep in!",
      "content": "Remember to bring clothes to sleep in! Bring 1-2 sleep outfits for the week. If you tend to get cold at night, you may also want to bring a light sweater to put on in the evenings. If you are trying to save space, you could plan on wearing the same shirt you wear during the day to bed at night. [7] X Research source"

      "title": "Plan your footwear carefully.",
      "content": "Plan your footwear carefully. Bring 1 pair of comfortable shoes for walking. If you are planning on going out, bring 1 pair of dress shoes or flats that go with your outfit. For the beach, bring 1 pair of sandals. The fewer pairs of shoes you bring, the lighter your bag will be. [8] X Research source Don't forget to pack shoes for any special activities you will be doing, like mountain climbing or white water rafting. Wear your bulkiest pair of shoes when you are traveling to your destination to save room in your luggage."

      "title": "Pack your undergarments.",
      "content": "Pack your undergarments. Bring 4-5 pairs of underwear, 4-5 pairs of socks, 2-3 undershirts/bras, and any slips or specialty items you might need (for example, if you need a backless bra for a dress). If you have limited packing space, bring fewer pairs of undergarments and plan on washing dirty clothes in the sink where you are staying. [9] X Research source Some accommodations offer washing and drying machines that you can use while you are traveling."

      "title": "Choose your accessories carefully and coordinate with your outfits.",
      "content": "Choose your accessories carefully and coordinate with your outfits. Some things you may like to have with you are sunglasses, scarves, hats, jewelry, ties, and belts. If packing jewelry, be careful to not bring anything extremely valuable in case it gets lost or stolen. [10] X Research source It can also be fun to buy new accessories as souvenirs when you travel, like scarves or hats. If you think you may like to do this, leave those items at home to save space."

      "content": "Pack travel-sized toiletries for essential items. For the most part, you should be able to get toiletries at your destination, either from the hotel or from a local drugstore. But if you have things from home you want to bring (or just to save money by not having to buy anything when you arrive) transfer your lotions and shampoos and liquids into travel-sized containers. [13] X Research source If you are flying and bringing a carry on bag, make sure to check the TSA regulations for liquids."

      "content": "Gather your luggage and everything you want to pack in one place. For a 5 day vacation, you should easily be able to pack all your clothes and necessities in 1 bag or suitcase. Getting everything into the same space will help you stay organized as you put things into your bag. If you are packing for multiple people, try keeping luggage and piles of clothing/toiletries separated so you don't get confused and misplace something."

      "title": "Roll your clothes to save space.",
      "content": "Roll your clothes to save space. Tightly rolling clothes helps prevent wrinkles and saves space in your luggage! Follow this technique: lay the item of clothing flat, then fold the bottom 2 inches (5.1 cm) of the item inside out (this will create an envelope/pocket). From the opposite end of the fold, roll the item tightly until you get to the pocket. Then, fold one side of the pocket over the roll to secure it. [14] X Research source You can also pack socks and underclothes inside of shoes to save space. Pack shoes, toiletries, and other heavy items at the bottom of your bag. This will keep them from wrinkling or damaging your clothes."

      "title": "Download electronic versions of books and magazines to save space.",
      "content": "Download electronic versions of books and magazines to save space. If you have an iPad, Kindle, or something similar, you can download books and magazines to read without taking up essential room in your luggage. A lot of magazine subscriptions offer free electronic access, too, so check into that option if you already subscribe to a magazine! If you are going to bring a physical book with you, consider taking one you wouldn't mind leaving behind. This will at least save you some room on the way back (or give you space for a souvenir or 2)."

      "title": "Keep a small bag of essential items at hand if you are flying.",
      "content": "Keep a small bag of essential items at hand if you are flying. This will save you time and energy when you get on the plane. Keep a small bag inside your carry on that contains what you want for your flight (a book, magazine, pen, paper, headphones, cough drops, earplugs). This way when you get on the plane, you can pull out this smaller bag and stow the carry on without much hassle. [15] X Research source Even if you are driving, it can be nice to have a small bag nearby with snacks, your phone, a book, and other essential items, like your phone charger. If you are traveling with kids, it's helpful to have some activities planned to keep them entertained. Sticker books are thin and light, and you can often find travel-sized versions of board games, too."
