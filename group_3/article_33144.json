Although flashlight tag is typically played outside, you can also play inside with the lights off! Just be sure to clear away anything that someone could trip on during the game. [1] X Research source When playing outside, you don't have to play when it is completely dark. If you need to be home by a certain time or if you get scared at night, you can play at dusk or in a better lit area (such as a park). You can also play with silly string during the day instead of a flashlight."

Ask some of your neighborhood friends to play on a weekend. This game is also fun to play when you have a party or sleepover. Flashlight tag can also be played with your family. If you have brothers or sisters, ask them if they would like to play. If you are an only child, ask your parents or grandparents. If your parents hesitate to let you play outside when it's dark, ask if one of them would play or at least come with you. Your friends' parents might also feel better knowing an adult is there. Bring some extra batteries with you, in case the batteries in your flashlight quit working in the middle of the game. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Hide! Have the person who is 'it' count to a set number (such as 100), while everyone else hides. The person who is 'it' should close their eyes or wear a blindfold during this time. Good hiding places can be found through nature. You could, for example, hide behind a tree or a bush. You could also crouch below a large rock or hill. If you're playing in someone's backyard, make use of the structures. Hide underneath a slide. Hide under the table in the playhouse."

      "content": "Seek! After counting to the specified number, the person who is 'it' can then start to look for people. As with regular tag, once you are tagged, you are out. However, to tag someone in flashlight tag, the person who is 'it' must tag people with the beam of the flashlight and call their names. In regular tag, if you can run faster than the 'it' person, you can evade them for a while. But with flashlight tag, the 'it' person can tag you with the light from a distance. Thus, while you are hiding, scope out your location and look for other places you could dart behind. To avoid being tagged with the beam from the flashlight, you'll need to put something between yourself and the 'it' person."

[3] X Research source Once you are 'out,' you can no longer participate in the game, but watching and cheering from the sidelines is also fun! Alternately, instead of playing until everyone has been tagged, you can also play with a rotating 'it' person. In this case, once someone is tagged, they become the new 'it' person and the person who tagged them hands over the flashlight. [4] X Research source With a rotating 'it' person, you will need to hide not only from the current 'it' person but from everyone playing the game.

If a friend has a large backyard, you could play flashlight tag in an area away from street lights or porch lights. If you know a playground will be open after dark, consider playing there. You can also play indoors with the lights off. This works best in a big, open room, like a furnished basement without too much furniture. Be careful playing around heavy furniture or household items that could break."

If you have ten or more people who want to play, team flashlight might be more fun than playing with only one 'it' person. With team flashlight, half of the people playing are 'it' at the same time, so be sure to have enough flashlights for half of your friends. Be sure to have extra batteries handy so that if someone's flashlight stops working mid-game, they can replace their batteries quickly. You may also want to set a rule to employ if batteries do run out. For instance, if someone's batteries do run out, they would have 30 seconds or one minute to “pause” and replace their batteries before rejoining the game. During this “pause,” they could not be tagged 'out.'"
