      "title": "Pick flowers that are fully blossomed but aren't shedding petals.",
      "content": "Pick flowers that are fully blossomed but aren't shedding petals. Petals look their best when the flower is blooming but before it starts to wilt. Look for flowers that have opened all of the way. Check that the flowers you choose have clean, unblemished petals. [1] X Research source Preserving petals is a great way to save or recycle a bouquet of flowers. However, you can also harvest your own flowers from outside."

      "title": "Choose chemical-free petals for beauty treatments, cooking, or tea.",
      "content": "Choose chemical-free petals for beauty treatments, cooking, or tea. You may want to use your preserved flowers to make lotion, cleanser, body oil, bath salt, or tea. If so, use flowers that haven't been treated with pesticides or herbicides. Otherwise, you may accidentally absorb or ingest unwanted chemicals. [3] X Research source For instance, you might look for organic flowers. If you want to use dried flowers in recipes often, consider growing your own flowers."

      "title": "Pluck the petals from the blossoms using your fingers.",
      "content": "Pluck the petals from the blossoms using your fingers. Gently pull all of the petals from the blossom. Be careful so that you don't tear or damage the petals. Place the plucked petals in a clean dish or on a fresh paper towel. Discard the stem, leaves, and center of the blossom. [4] X Research source Throw out any petals that look damaged or bruised."

      "title": "Dry the petals in the sun for 2 weeks for an easy option.",
      "content": "Dry the petals in the sun for 2 weeks for an easy option. Cover a shallow baking pan with paper towels, then spread a thin layer of petals over the towels. Place the pan near a window where the petals get direct sunlight. Leave the petals to dry for 2 weeks, turning them daily to ensure they dry evenly. [5] X Research source Pick a window that isn't near an air conditioning vent or fan, as moving air could blow the petals away. The petals will shrink and curl up as they dry."

      "title": "Press the petals in a heavy book for 1 month for prettier petals.",
      "content": "Press the petals in a heavy book for 1 month for prettier petals. Arrange the flower petals in a single layer on a sheet of wax paper. Cover the petals with a second sheet of wax paper. Open the book at the approximate center and carefully lay the wax sheets containing the petals over one side of the book. Close the book over the wax paper and stack 2-3 more books on top. Wait 1 month for your petals to dry out. [6] X Research source You can also use plain paper if you don’t have wax paper. However, sometimes the moisture from the petals soaks through plain paper and may stain your book pages. Pressing your petals creates prettier petals because they'll have flat edges and won't look shriveled."

      "content": "Spray dried flowers with hairspray to make them last longer. Hairspray works best with dried flowers or a dried bouquet. [7] X Expert Source Jeanne Walker Florist Expert Interview. 15 April 2020. Hold the flower or bouquet upside down in a well-ventilated area. Position the hairspray about 6 in (15 cm) away from the flowers and spray a light, even coat of hairspray onto the petals. Let the hairspray dry for 10 minutes, then display or store your flowers. [8] X Research source Aerosol hairspray works best for preserving flower petals because the bottle makes it easier to apply an even layer of hairspray."

      "content": "Put the flower petals in silica gel to dry them quickly. Put a .5 to 1 in (1.3 to 2.5 cm) layer of silica gel in a clean air-tight container. Place a single layer of flower petals over the silica gel, then add another .5 to 1 in (1.3 to 2.5 cm) of silica gel. Secure the lid on the container and let it sit for 2-3 days. Check them to see if they're dry. [9] X Research source If they're not dry after 2-3 days, let them sit for another 2 days, then check them again. They will dry out within 2 weeks, usually sooner. Silica gel is a porous form of silicon dioxide that absorbs moisture. It looks like tiny blue or clear beads. You can purchase it at a craft supply store, big box store, or online. You can reuse silica gel until it turns pink, which means it's lost all moisture."

      "content": "Cover the petals in sand to dehydrate the petals slowly. Spread about 1 in (2.5 cm) of sand across the bottom of a container. Place a layer of flower petals over the surface of the sand. Then, cover the petals with 1 in (2.5 cm) of sand. Let them sit for 2 weeks, then slowly pour off the sand to reveal preserved petals. [10] X Research source You can reuse the sand if you like."

      "title": "Use a food dehydrator to dry out the petals fast.",
      "content": "Use a food dehydrator to dry out the petals fast. Spread the flower petals in a single layer across a dehydrating tray. Put the dehydrating tray into the food dehydrator and set it at 90 to 95 °F (32 to 35 °C). Allow your petals to dry for 4 hours, then check to see if they are done. Rotate the trays every hour to help the petals dry evenly. [11] X Research source If the petals aren't fully dehydrated after 4 hours, leave them in the dehydrator for another hour before checking them again. Continue to check the petals every hour until they are fully dry. It will likely take 6-8 hours for the petals to dry out."

      "content": "Microwave the petals in 30- to 60-second increments for a quick option. Cover a plate with a paper towel and layer your flower petals across the towel. Drape a second paper towel over the petals and place a glass tile or plate over the top paper towel. Microwave the petals for 1 minute, then check to see if the petals are dry. [12] X Research source If the petals aren’t dry, replace the paper towels and nuke the petals for 30 seconds. Continue to microwave the petals in 30-second intervals until they are dry. Change the paper towels each time you nuke the petals."

      "content": "Store dried petals in an air-tight container in a cool, dry place. Your dried petals should last for several months to a year. To prevent them from molding or decaying, place them in an air-tight container. Then, store them in a cabinet or pantry away from heat sources. [14] X Research source For instance, you might choose a large, sterile mason jar for petals you plan to use for beauty treatments or cooking. On the other hand, you might choose something decorative if you want to display the petals. For a simple option, use a plastic bag that has a seal."

Then, add a carrier oil to the jar, covering the flower petals with at least 2 in (5.1 cm) of oil. Put a lid on the jar and place it in a clean, dry place for 4-6 weeks. Shake the jar once every 2-3 days to agitate the petals. [15] X Research source Great options for carrier oils include sweet almond oil, jojoba oil, and grapeseed oil. Your infused oil will keep for up to 1 year if you store it in an air-tight container in a clean, dry place."
