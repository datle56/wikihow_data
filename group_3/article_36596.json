      "content": "Ice the wax. Once the wax is dry, chill it using ice. Add a few ice cubes in a plastic sandwich bag and apply it to the surface of the wax. Chilling the wax will cause it to become brittle and easier to chip away. [2] X Research source If the wax is on a pillow or removable fabric, consider putting the fabric in the freezer for better results."

      "title": "Scrape off the wax.",
      "content": "Scrape off the wax. Using a butter knife, gently scrape the excess wax off of the fabric. Be careful to not use too much force as you could damage the fabric. You probably will not be able to remove all of the wax from the upholstery at this time."

      "title": "Warm up an iron.",
      "content": "Warm up an iron. Plug in a clothes iron and let it warm up to a medium heat setting. Read the fabricâ€™s label to ensure that the fabric is iron safe. If the fabric does not have a label, test the iron on a small, inconspicuous spot before applying the heat to a larger area. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Place a brown paper bag over the wax.",
      "content": "Place a brown paper bag over the wax. Iron the brown paper bag. The iron will begin to melt the wax and transfer it from the fabric to the paper bag. [4] X Research source A clean rag can be used in place of a paper bag; however, the wax is likely to remain on the cloth after washing. Be careful to use a paper bag without any writing. The ink from the print will transfer and stain the upholstery. If you use a paper bag from a store with a label, cut the label off of the bag before use."

      "content": "Heat the stain with a hairdryer. If you do not have an iron available, a hairdryer can have the same effect. Use the hairdryer to melt the wax and then carefully lay the brown paper bag on top of the wax. The paper bag will begin to absorb the warm wax. Repeat the process until all of the wax has been transferred. Use a blank paper bag or clean rag for this method as well."

Use warm water to clean the solution from the fabric once all of the wax is removed. Test the WD-40 on an inconspicuous portion of the fabric before using it on a more noticeable section."
