      "content": "Understand how the associative method works. The human mind is very good at associating things. This talent runs so deep, in fact, that it's possible to use that ability to memorize things. For this memory, you'll create an imaginary journey or walk-through that you'll associate with what you have to remember. Going on your imaginary journey or walk-through will bring up your memories. Associating a concept with a certain image, person, or picture can help boost your recall. [2] X Expert Source Ted Coopersmith, MBA Academic Tutor Expert Interview. 10 July 2020."

Throughout history, people have used some variation on the associative method (like imagining walking through mental houses, looking around an imaginary room or flipping through a pretend book) to organize memories. [3] X Research source Memories that are easy to split up and spatially organize are best suited for the associative method - things like the stanzas of a poem, components of a machine or the procedure for cooking eggs. Memories that can't be divided up are less well-suited - like the basic idea of Abstract Expressionist painting, the history of the War of the Roses or remembering how to ask someone out."

      "content": "Imagine a set of second memories and associate them with what you have to remember. You'll use your second set of memories as a \"key\" for what you have to remember. For this reason, if you have a list of discrete items that don't fit together in any way, it'll be harder to shape your second \"key\" memories. For our example, we'll simply imagine being a tiny little man walking around inside a 1911 slide."

This can be as cool and interesting or simple and easy to remember as you want to make it. For our example, a tiny man walking through a 1911 slide might say: \" First we'll encounter the barrel bushing, and inside it, I can see the barrel poking out. Behind the barrel and the breech face as we walk further back I'll see a tiny hole through which I can see the firing pin, and to its left will be the extractor against the side of the slide; when I make it to the very back, I'll reach the hammer stop. \""

Memorizing through repetition encourages your brain to form the necessary connections to say or do what you've memorized. [4] X Research source Rote memorization is very good for manual tasks and short lists of items like a shopping list, starting a car, or ironing a shirt. Rote memorization is not very good for memorizing a large number of separate items or single complex ideas like the elements of the periodic table from left to right, the idea of dialectical materialism, or the components of a car engine.

      "title": "Know what chunking is good for.",
      "content": "Know what chunking is good for. Chunking works well when you're memorizing things that are composed of smaller things in a sensible order. Our example could subdivide by continent; the elements of the periodic table could be broken down by type; or if you have to memorize the components of an engine, you could divide it up into sub-assemblies (intake, engine, exhaust, electrical). [7] X Research source If you've ever memorized a phone number, you might have noticed the way we write them - they're set up to be chunk-memorized. For instance, the White House phone number, (202) 456-1111 is easier to remember as three numbers - 202, 456 and 1111 - than it is to remember as a single complex number, 2,024,561,111. Chunking isn't a great strategy for big, complex things and concepts that don't break down into parts easily. For example, it's not easy to figure out what \"memorizable\" chunks would be for memorizing the concept of civil rights, the definition of nationhood or a list of similar phone numbers.
