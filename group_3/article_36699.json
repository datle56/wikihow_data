If there are individual buttons for the numbers, press the buttons in order. [1] X Research source If you screw up on the order of the code for the button-style lockboxes, just re-enter it."

      "content": "Pull down on the tab on the front of the lockbox to open it. On most lockboxes, like the common Master lockbox, there is a small black tab on the front. Once the code is entered, pull it down to open the box. Some lockboxes have an unlabeled button or a small panel that says “press,” instead. If that’s your box, press the button or the panel to open it. [2] X Research source"

Then, lift the lockbox off of the door knob. [4] X Research source If the lockbox won’t open while you’re pressing the tab down, try jiggling the box while you pull on it. If it has been locked a long time, rain and moisture can get into the lock and cause it to rust."

To start, open the door and go inside. Use a Phillips head screw driver to remove the two screws holding the rose plate to the door. [5] X Research source The rose plate is the bracket that covers up the spindle where it feeds into the door. The spindle is the bar that connects the round part of the knob to the knob on the other side of the door. When you turn the door knob, this is the part that rotates to open the lock."

Pull it off of the door and leave the lock mechanism where it is in the door.

Line the two holes up and slide a pin or micro screwdriver into the two holes. This will unlock the spindle and the knob will pop off of the rose plate. [8] X Research source Anything that fits into the holes will work. A thumbtack, unraveled paper clip, or sewing needle will work. You must push the pin or screwdriver all the way into both holes."

Close the handles together to see if the shackle snaps under the pressure. It may take 2-3 attempts to fully cut through the lock and remove it.

Buy, rent, or borrow an angle grinder and attach a metal-cutting blade to it by pressing the spindle rotation lock and unscrewing the nut on the blade. Put on gloves and protective eyewear. Then, turn the grinder on and slowly hold the blade against the shackle with both hands on the grinder. Continue to work the grinder against the shackle until the lock breaks. [11] X Research source This is going to send sparks flying, so take your time, go slow, and take breaks to give the blade time to cool down. You can buy an angle grinder online or from any home improvement store."

Turn the saw on to the lowest speed setting available and slowly begin grinding away at the shackle. Take your time and do your best to avoid accidentally cutting your door. After a few minutes of cutting, the lock should fall off. [12] X Research source Work very slowly here and do your best to keep the blade from nicking your door."
