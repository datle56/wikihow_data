      "content": "Place 2 benches on either side of the gym or courtyard. Make sure the benches are sturdy enough so that multiple people can stand on them at the same time. Place these benches close enough to the middle of the gym or court so that a person can throw a dodgeball from the middle to the person on the bench. [1] X Research source If you don’t have physical benches to use, you can also use chalk or tape to draw long rectangular squares for people to stand in instead of an actual bench."

      "content": "Divide the players into 2 teams and have each team choose a goalie. The goalie will be the person who stands on the bench at the start of the game and tries to catch the dodgeball. There’s no particular qualities that a good goalie ought to have, although anybody who can’t throw very well may benefit from being the first person on their team’s bench. [2] X Research source If you have different colored jerseys, give them to the members of each team so that they feel more a part of their respective teams."

      "title": "Position the dodgeballs either in the middle of or across the court.",
      "content": "Position the dodgeballs either in the middle of or across the court. You can place them on the dividing line in the middle of the gym and have both teams run to them at the start of the game. You could also just distribute the balls evenly to both teams to avoid having people run at each other. [3] X Research source Aim to provide around 4 or 5 dodgeballs for each team. Be sure to use soft dodgeballs that won’t hurt any players if they’re accidentally hit by one."

      "content": "Start the game by having players run to pick up the dodgeballs. If you’re in a gym, you can have the players on each side keep 1 hand on the walls until you say “go.” If you distributed the dodgeballs to both teams ahead of time, you can start the game by simply saying “go.” [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Have the players attempt to toss the balls to the goalie one at a time.",
      "content": "Have the players attempt to toss the balls to the goalie one at a time. The goal of the game is to successfully throw the balls without the other team catching or intercepting them. You can also add different rules to this aspect of the game to make it more interesting. [5] X Research source For example, you can also require the players on each team to pass the ball a certain number of times before throwing it to the goalie. This will require the players to think strategically about where they want the ball to land on the fifth pass. Note that players are not allowed to cross the middle line in trying to throw the ball to the goalie."

      "content": "Have players who successfully throw to the goalie go to the bench. When the goalie catches a ball, the player who threw the ball goes to the bench and becomes the new goalie. Now, their teammates still on the court must try to throw their balls to the new goalie. [6] X Research source The original goalie must hold the ball they caught until the game is over."

They then go back to their side of the court and have to try to get back on the bench again by throwing the ball to the original goalie. In this case, the original goalie puts down the ball they’re holding to try to catch the new ball. [7] X Research source"
