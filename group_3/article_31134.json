      "content": "Slide small furniture on the carpet with pieces of cardboard. Small tables and chairs are good options since they likely won't be too heavy. Find an empty cardboard box, and cut it into pieces big enough to slide under the legs of your furniture. [1] X Research source To keep furniture from sliding off the cardboard, bend the tips upward to create a barrier. You may have to connect the barrier with strong tape or glue to keep them bent. Try duct tape or crazy clue. Just make sure it doesn’t stick to the furniture. To make cardboard more durable, attach multiple pieces together (2 or 3) before placing them under the legs. Use tape or glue. Alternatively, use entire cardboard boxes, such as empty tissue boxes, to slide furniture across the carpet. Just slip the legs in the openings."

      "content": "Use pieces of aluminum foil to slide small furniture. Tear enough pieces of aluminum foil to slide under your furniture legs. You can mold the aluminum foil against the furniture legs, which will keep it in place. It doesn't matter which side of the foil you use against the carpet. [2] X Research source To make the foil thick enough, you may have to evenly fold it 1 or 2 times before placing it underneath. This will ensure it doesn't shred as you are sliding your furniture."

      "content": "Try sliding that furniture with plastic lids or containers. Choose ones that will fit your furniture. Turn lids upside down so the areas that secure around containers are facing upward. Place your lids or containers under the furniture legs, and slide them to your desired location.

      "content": "Use frisbees to slide furniture longer distances. Their durable plastic design makes them easy to slide across the carpet. Make sure they're not too big to use. Turn the frisbees upside down, and place the furniture legs on the bottom side. The legs will be secured by the frisbees’ upward-facing curves. [4] X Research source Don't use frisbees with holes in the middle."

      "content": "Move heavier furniture with carpet sliders. They can work effectively on the carpet thanks to their smooth design. They come in different shapes and sizes. This equipment is usually made of hard plastic and durable rubber foam. Slightly lift your furniture, and center the sliders underneath the legs. Push or pull as needed. Find furniture sliders at hardware or home goods stores, such as Lowe's. Make sure the foam is directly under the leg, and the plastic is against the carpet."

      "title": "Strap on a shoulder dolly to lift heavier furniture across the carpet.",
      "content": "Strap on a shoulder dolly to lift heavier furniture across the carpet. A shoulder dolly uses your legs and shoulders to lift items. The load feels lighter since it frees your hands. Bending over isn’t necessary, allowing for proper upright posture. This equipment includes straps and harnesses for 2 people, so make sure you have a partner. It’s one-size-fits-all and adjustable to different heights. A shoulder dolly can lift up to 1000 pounds. It moves furniture seamlessly across the carpet and other surfaces. Fit the webbing through the buckles and attach it together. Place the webbing directly under the furniture, and carefully lift to move it to your desired location. Use your hands to stabilize the furniture so it doesn't fall over."

      "content": "Attach forklift straps to your forearms to ease the travel. These straps work similarly to a shoulder dolly. The only differences are where you place the straps on your body as well as the design of them. This method forces you and your partner to place hands on the furniture to stabilize it as you move across carpet. [5] X Research source Adjust the straps for differences in height between you and your partner."

      "content": "Roll furniture on a moving dolly over your carpet. A moving dolly generally consists of wheels attached to a flat surface. You can place your furniture on the flat surface and push it to your desired location. Some moving dollies have handles you can grip for tilting and stabilizing furniture as you roll it. [6] X Research source Although carpet dollies are designed to transport long and heavy carpet rolls, you can use them to move furniture across your carpet. Choose the type that allows you to completely place furniture on a flat surface."
