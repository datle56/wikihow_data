      "content": "Study the Gospel yourself. Before you can share the Gospel, it’s important that you understand the Gospel yourself. Even if you think you know it well, take a moment to try to explain it. If there’s anything you’re uncertain about, read the Bible and/or ask a religious leader to explain it. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Practice what you’re going to say.",
      "content": "Practice what you’re going to say. While sharing the Gospel should feel natural, it doesn’t hurt to prepare what you want to say ahead of time so you don’t miss anything important. Plus, people will be more likely to listen to what you have to say if you’re calm and collected rather than stuttering over your words. After delivering your message a few times, it’ll be a breeze. Remember, you want to leave enough room in the conversation for the other person to ask questions. Try to keep your message to less than 3 minutes to avoid turning the conversation into a speech. If it helps, practice with friends, family, or members of your church to get advice."

      "title": "Pray for opportunities to share the Gospel.",
      "content": "Pray for opportunities to share the Gospel. Before you start sharing the Gospel, pray for God to give you guidance. Ask God to give you the words to say and the wisdom to know when and how to share your faith. Pray that the person you’re sharing with will be open to receiving the message, and trust that God will guide you where you need to be. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Build a relationship with the person you want to share with.",
      "content": "Build a relationship with the person you want to share with. While you can share the Gospel with strangers or people you don’t know very well, it is generally recommended to build a relationship with someone before sharing the Gospel. Get to know them as a person so you can develop trust and respect. This way, they’re more likely to be open to hearing your message. [3] X Research source Whether you’re sharing the Gospel with a friend or a stranger, be bold but not pushy. If the person is clearly uncomfortable or uninterested, shut the conversation down."
    },
    {
      "title": "Share your testimony.",
      "content": "Share your testimony. Sometimes, people are more willing to open up if you share a personal story with them. Talk about how and why you became a Christian and how your religion has impacted your life. Be open and vulnerable about your struggles and how God helped you overcome them. This way, the person you’re talking to can understand the power of the Gospel. [4] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Explain the Gospel simply.",
      "content": "Explain the Gospel simply. The more complex your explanation is, the more likely people will shut down. When sharing the Gospel, think of it as a conversation rather than a presentation. Talk to them about how and why God created humanity, how everyone has sinned, why Jesus died on the cross, and why people should accept Christ into their lives. [5] X Research source If it helps, remember that the Gospel has 4 key movements: Creation, the Fall, Redemption, and Restoration. Briefly summarize each of these parts to explain the Gospel in a way that people can easily understand."

      "title": "Answer any questions they may have.",
      "content": "Answer any questions they may have. After you’ve shared your message, it’s likely the other person will have questions about the Gospel or other elements of Christianity. If you’re confident in your understanding of their question, go ahead and answer to the best of your ability. If you’re not sure, be honest with them and let them know you’d be happy to find the answer for them. This is also a great opportunity to invite them to pray and/or join you at church if they seem open to the idea. [6] X Research source While many people may not be saved from one conversation, this can open up further communication between you two. It’s okay if you don’t have all the answers. It doesn’t mean that you’re a bad Christian or that you’ve failed at sharing the Gospel. Everyone is constantly learning new things. Think of this as an opportunity to study the Bible and build a deeper connection with God."

      "title": "The Gospel is the good news of what Jesus has done.",
      "content": "The Gospel is the good news of what Jesus has done. The word “Gospel” literally translates to “good news,” and in Christianity, the Gospel is the message of everything God has done through Christ to secure humanity’s salvation. It describes the journey of humanity through Creation, the fall of Adam and Eve and the introduction of sin, Jesus’s sacrifice, and how people can be saved by accepting Christ into their lives. [7] X Research source Christians share the Gospel in an attempt to get non-Christians to understand what Christ has done and to get them to accept Him into their hearts."

      "content": "Share the Gospel when you feel equipped to do so. The time frame is different for everyone; some Christians share the Gospel soon after accepting Christ into their life, while for others, it takes a bit more time. Pray to God and trust that He will let you know when it’s time. [8] X Research source Until then, continue studying the Gospel so you’re prepared when you’re called to do so."

      "title": "Share when you think the other person is open to listening.",
      "content": "Share when you think the other person is open to listening. As a Christian, it’s understandable that you want to share your love for God with everyone. However, not everyone will be open to hearing your message as soon as you meet them. This is why it’s important to get to know others before sharing the Gospel. This way, you can see where they are in their faith journey and share your message when you think it would be most beneficial."

      "title": "Start a conversation in an appropriate setting.",
      "content": "Start a conversation in an appropriate setting. While Christians are encouraged to share the Gospel whenever there’s an opportunity, some situations might not be appropriate. For example, it isn’t the best idea to share the Gospel if the other person is unable to remove themselves from the conversation, like if you’re a customer and they’re a cashier. Share the Gospel with those who are truly open and ready to learn—not a captive audience. However, if you’re already having a conversation with someone at the grocery store, on the bus, or even online, feel free to bring up the topic. If they seem interested, share the Gospel with them. If there isn’t time for a conversation, offer them a pamphlet or note that explains the Gospel. If someone has already started asking you questions about Christianity or your experience with the religion, it might be a good opportunity to share the Gospel with them. Be sensitive to the setting and context of the conversation. If someone is already upset, angry, or distracted, they probably won’t be open to hearing what you have to say."

      "title": "Respect people’s boundaries and religion.",
      "content": "Respect people’s boundaries and religion. While you may wish otherwise, not everyone is going to be open to hearing about the Gospel, and it’s important to respect their wishes. Someone may be of another religion, they could’ve had negative experiences with someone trying to share the Gospel in the past, or they may simply be uninterested or busy. If they decline when you offer to share, take them for their word. Trust that God will lead you to someone who is ready to hear what you have to say. [9] X Research source If someone isn’t open to hearing the Gospel at a certain point in time, it doesn’t mean they’ll always feel that way. Continue developing your relationship and see if things change down the line. Just be respectful of their opinions and don’t try to force your beliefs upon them. If you come across as too pushy, even if it’s by accident, people may shut down and be unwilling to hear you out. Instead, lead by example and listen to what they have to say. If they see that you’re a kind person and you’re not trying to push your beliefs onto them, they may be more willing to have a conversation. It’s also important to respect people’s boundaries for your own safety, as well. If someone becomes argumentative or otherwise reacts negatively, it’s best to thank them for their time and remove yourself from the situation. This is another reason it’s often better to get to know someone rather than trying to share the Gospel with strangers."
