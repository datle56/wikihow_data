      "content": "Learn why you should register your dog. Regardless of which dog registry you are considering, it is important for you to understand the benefits of dog registration. For example, registering your dog provides valid proof that you are his owner. [1] X Research source Obtaining this proof is one of the first steps towards becoming a responsible pet owner. [2] X Research source If your dog is purebred, registering him helps ensure that his pedigree remains intact from one generation to the next. [3] X Research source Purebred dog registries provide other benefits, such as maintenance of birth records. [4] X Research source You can still enjoy the benefits of dog registration even if your dog is not purebred. Registries such as the Dog Registry of America and the National Hybrid Registry accept non-purebred dogs. [5] X Research source Remember that registration is not proof of breed quality. [6] X Research source This is more applicable if you are looking to purchase a purebred dog, rather than registering your own. If you are only interested in registering your dog for proof of ownership, then getting an Identichip/microchip implanted in your dog is best. If your dog gets lost and is picked up by a rescue, the shelter will scan the chip, pick up the unique number, and be able to reunite the two of you.

      "content": "Determine where you want to register your dog. The three most reputable and well-known all-breed registries in North America are the AKC, the United Kennel Club, and the Canadian Kennel Club. [8] X Research source It may be helpful to start your search with these registries to determine if your dog is eligible for registration. The website http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/dogregistry/dogclubsregistries.htm provides a comprehensive list of dog registries for both purebred and non-purebred dogs. If you have a service dog, consider registering him with a service dog registry, such as the United States Service Dog Registry. [9] X Research source Some dog breeds are so rare that they are not listed on the more common dog registries. The American Rare Breed Association has a registry for rare dog breeds (e.g., wirehaired Vizsla, miniature American shepherd). There are also breed-specific registries, such as the registry associated with the Australian Shepherd Club of America. [10] X Research source"

      "content": "Avoid suspicious or non-reputable dog registries. Not all dog registries are created equal. Dog registries that primarily cater to puppy mills are not reputable and should be avoided. Also, be suspicious of dog registries that do not require a valid proof of pedigree. Do not use dog registries that require only a photo of your dog as proof of his pedigree. Reputable dog registries are non-profit organizations. Be wary of dog registries that are for-profit companies. Avoid dog registries that do not have a code of ethics or set of standards that registrants must follow. Some online registries may be especially unscrupulous by charging unreasonably high fees or disappearing after receiving your payment. [11] X Research source Consider speaking with your veterinarian, other dog owners, or a reputable breeder for recommendations on respectable registries."
