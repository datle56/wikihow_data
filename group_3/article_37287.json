Many newer keyboards have a key dedicated to resetting your keyboard back to factory settings, which can be useful if you created some macros or personalizations with your keyboard that you no longer use or want. For example, to reset a wireless Corsair keyboard, turn it off, press and hold the ESC key, and turn the keyboard back on. The keyboard lights will flash if the reset is successful. If you have a K95 RGB Platinum or any MK2 keyboard from Corsair, unplug it from your computer, press and hold the ESC key, and plug it back in. It'll flash, then you can unplug it and plug it back in again. However, if you have an K55 keyboard from Corsair, unplug the keyboard and press FN + F4 . Plug the keyboard back into your computer while holding these keys, then open the iCUE software and update the keyboard's firmware. [1] X Research source Alternatively, for an ASUS Claymore II keyboard, press and hold FN + F3 while plugged into the computer, and the lights should be red, flashing or strobing to indicate that you've reset the keyboard. Note that you should look up your specific keyboard for the reset procedure since every manufacturer has different instructions."
