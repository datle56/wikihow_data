      "title": "Usage.",
      "content": "Usage. Phoenix skills are more designed to support your allies. It has 1 large AOE skill for damage, so it isn't the most effective offensive Fruit (see this wikiHow article for more on rankings of Fruits in Blox Fruits). When transformed, you can be a decent support in raids for your healing skills. Some Blox Fruit players [1] X Research source prefer Light over Phoenix Fruit. So is Phoenix Fruit a good Fruit? Depends on your play style. If you want to raid with others, Phoenix Fruit is a great Fruit for support and healing roles. However, if you're mostly a solo player, a Fruit with higher damage will be better for you."

If you don't have 400+ mastery in the Phoenix Fruit, you can join a Phoenix raid someone else is hosting. That way, you can Awaken your Phoenix Fruit without needing 400+ mastery in it. Check out our article on leveling Fruits to quickly get 400+ mastery in Phoenix Fruit."
