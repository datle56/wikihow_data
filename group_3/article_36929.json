      "title": "Reset the dryer if the motor isn't running.",
      "content": "Reset the dryer if the motor isn't running. Let the dryer cool for about 10 minutes, then press the \"reset\" button. If this doesn't work, try some of the steps below."

      "title": "Unplug the dryer and disconnect the grounding wire before starting any work.",
      "content": "Unplug the dryer and disconnect the grounding wire before starting any work. Close the gas-supply valve if it is a gas-fueled dryer."

    {
      "title": "Clean the dryer's exhaust vent.",
      "content": "Clean the dryer's exhaust vent. Disconnect the vent from its collar and remove lint from the screen inside. The vent is located behind the dryer. Use a vent-cleaning brush to remove lint from inside the vent itself. Use a garden hose or auger to remove clogs if the vent pipe or tubing is badly clogged. Disassemble the joint near the end of the hose or auger and remove the clog."

    {
      "title": "Check the door gasket.",
      "content": "Check the door gasket. Hold a piece of tissue near the crack of the door while the dryer is running. If it flutters, the door is not properly sealing hot air inside it, and the gasket needs to be replaced with an identical model. Adjust and clean the door latch if the dryer is not running. If it still will not run, check the door switch."
    },
    {
      "title": "Check the start switch.",
      "content": "Check the start switch. Remove the control panel and use a volt-ohm-millimmeter to test the switch. Set the VOM to the RX1 scale. Connect the probes of the VOM to the 2 switch leads after disconnecting them and press the switch closed. If the VOM reads 0, the switch is not the problem. If the VOM's needle jumps up, the switch needs to be replaced."
    },
    {
      "title": "Check the thermostats.",
      "content": "Check the thermostats. You can remove the back panel of the dryer to get to the control panel or operating thermostat. Clip the probes of a volt-ohm-millimmeter (set to RX1) to each terminal on a thermostat. If the VOM reads 0, the thermostat is not the problem. If the VOM's needle jumps up, the thermostat needs to be replaced."
    },
    {
      "title": "Replace the motor belt.",
      "content": "Replace the motor belt. Take off the front panel and remove the drum from the cabinet. Suck out any lint with a vacuum. Make sure the tensioner spins. If it doesn't, replace it. Wrap a new belt around the motor pulley if the motor runs but the drum doesn't rotate."

    {
      "title": "Adjust the shutter on a gas dryer.",
      "content": "Adjust the shutter on a gas dryer. Unscrew and remove the panel that covers the gas flame. Turn the dryer on and observe the flame. A deep blue flame and a whistling sound means it is receiving too much air. An all-yellow flame means it is not getting enough air. Adjust the shutter accordingly with the thumbscrew."
