This mixture will release most of the grime, and then you can rub it down with a cloth or sponge to help remove the rest of the grime. [1] X Research source Rinse off the soap when you're done."

For instance, you can find cleaners specifically for convertible car tops and dashboards, or alternatively, for things like vinyl siding and vinyl floors.

      "content": "Rub the cleaner in with a soft cloth. Use gentle, small circles to massage the cleaner into the vinyl. Don't scrub too hard, as that could damage the vinyl. However, you do want to go over it several times to make sure you're getting up the dirt and grime. [3] X Research source Always read the directions for your specific cleaner, as it may have different suggestions for how to use the cleaner."

      "title": "Remove the cleaner.",
      "content": "Remove the cleaner. With some vinyl cleaners, you'll simply need to wipe up the excess cleaner after it sits for a minute or 2. With other cleaners, you'll need to use water to wash it away. [4] X Research source Use a hose or bucket to pour water over the object if possible. If not, rinse your cloth and apply clean water over and over until the surface is clean."

      "content": "Pull out the vinyl piece to make cracks easily accessible. Whether the crack is in something like the dashboard or something else like a seat or even a restaurant booth, you need to be able to access the whole crack. You may need to take the dashboard or seat out of the car, for instance, so you can repair it. If you're not sure how to remove the item, look in your manual or check online for a tutorial."

Apply it to the cracked area, making sure to get down into the crack well. Start with a light layer. You don't need to fill in the whole crack at once. [6] X Research source Pick a compound that matches the rest of the vinyl color. Filling the crack in with layers increases the strength of the repairs."

Run the heat gun over the whole thing, moving back and forth so you don't stay in one spot too long. Basically, you want to gently melt the top layer of the vinyl, which in turn will give it a glossy shine. [8] X Research source You can find heat guns in auto repair shops. Basically, they're like blow dryers, except they get much hotter, so they allow you to heat things that require higher temperatures. If you leave a heat gun over one spot for too long, the vinyl may come off."

Keep going over the area so that the plastic begins to melt. It should look glossy before you move on to the next step.

Hold it in place with your gloved hand over the area for 10-15 seconds, pressing down as you do. Peel the paper back and check on the repair. [10] X Research source If it leaves bits of vinyl on the grain paper, make sure to scrap it off before doing the process again. Repeat if it didn't take the grain pattern the first time."

[11] X Research source Keep in mind that most resurfacing products won't fill in cracks and scratches. You should fill those in ahead of time as needed. Let it dry when you're done."

      "content": "Paint over old shutters to restore them. If your vinyl shutters are looking worn down, a coat of paint can do wonders. Pick an exterior acrylic latex paint designed for plastic. Take the shutters down to make the painting process easier. Lay them out on a tarp, and paint them with a paint brush. [12] X Research source Start with clean shutters. If yours are dirty, spray them down with a mixture of 1 part bleach to 4 parts water. Rinse them off. Mix a bit of dishwashing soap with warm water, and use a scrubbing brush to remove dirt. Rinse the shutters, and let them dry. A primer may help the paint stick better. Pick a color that's the same shade or lighter as the original shutters. Darker colors may cause the shutters to bend due to extra heat."
