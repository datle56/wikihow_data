      "title": "Plan your design, then string beads on a thread to make your Kandi.",
      "content": "Plan your design, then string beads on a thread to make your Kandi. Wrap an elastic plastic string around your wrist and add an extra 2 inches. Decide on a pattern or phrase for your bracelet, then fold the string in half so the beads don’t slip off as you're stringing them. String beads on the elastic so it’s completely full, and tie off the end of your Kandi bracelet with a knot. To tie a knot , cross one end of the bracelet's string over the other, then pull it behind the first end of the string, sort of like how you would begin tying your shoes. Pull both ends of the string until the bracelet is taut. Repeat this step two more times for a secure triple knot, then use scissors to cut off any excess string. If you want to make a Kandi cuff , follow the steps above to make the base ring, then take another piece of string and pass it through every other bead in the base ring, adding a spacer bead between each. Continue until you’ve completed the whole circle, and thread back through the first spacer bead. Follow this process of making new rows until you like the thicknesses of the cuff."

      "title": "Perform the PLUR handshake to trade Kandi.",
      "content": "Perform the PLUR handshake to trade Kandi. Approach someone respectfully and ask them if they’d be open to trading. If they agree, make a peace sign with your index and middle fingers, and touch the pads of your fingers with the other person. Make a half heart by joining your middle, index, ring, and pinkie fingers together, then curl your thumb underneath and touch it to the other person's thumb to form the bottom of the heart. Lock your fingers with the other person and then trade Kandi with your fingers interlocked. Pound fists, hug, and/or introduce yourself to finish the trade! The PLUR handshake also goes by the PLUR kiss, the Kandi kiss, the raver’s kiss, and the raver’s shake. Kandi bracelets are exchanged as symbols of friendship at raves. They’re a great way to remember someone you met and keep them with you at all times."

      "content": "“PLUR” stands for “peace,” “love,” “unity,” and “respect.” These four core values form the backbone of rave culture, guiding how ravers should act when they’re dancing and socializing. PLUR brings everyone together and promotes a sense of harmony, positivity, and inclusivity, which is what makes going to an EDM festival such a powerful and moving experience. [1] X Research source"
