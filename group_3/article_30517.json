      "content": "Run a speed test. Before you get down and dirty with your hardware and computer settings, check to see what kind of speeds you are getting and compare that to the advertised speeds for your service. There are a variety of speed test sites on the net, just search for \"speed test\" in Google and pick the top few results. Different tests will give you different results. Even the same test may give you different results between tests. This is due to the location of test servers and the number of people sharing your connection. Take multiple tests and find the average speed you are getting. You may need to have Flash installed to run the test. If given the option, pick the test server closest to your physical location. This will help get you the most accurate results (on speedtest.net, this is chosen automatically based on ping)"

      "content": "Compare your results against what you're paying for. Check with your service provider to see what speeds you should be getting. Keep in mind that speeds advertised by your provider are \"best case\" speeds, and you may not be able to actually get that number on a regular basis, especially if using WiFi. If you haven't upgraded your internet in a long time, you may be able to get better speeds for less money. Companies aren't usually keen to inform you of better deals, so check to see if new services are available that weren't when you signed up. Check with all the providers in your area. Be aware of the megabyte/megabit difference. Some Internet Service Providers (ISPs) advertise in megabits, not megabytes. There are 8 megabits (Mb) in a megabyte (MB), so if you are paying for 25 megabits per second (Mbps), then that's just over 3 megabytes per second (MBps) of actual maximum transfer speed. If your test result was measured in Kbps, then you divide that number by 1000 to attain your measurement in Mbps."

      "content": "Check for sources of interference. If you are using a wireless router, some devices can affect your connection due to interference. Wireless routers come in multiple varieties; 802.11 b, g, and n (2.4 GHz) or 802.11 a (5.8 GHz). Common devices that can interfere with your wireless connection are microwaves and cell phones, many of which operate in the 2.4 GHz range. In order to minimize interference, turn off data on your phone and move your microwave oven away from wireless devices and your router when you're using the connection. Your Internet signal will get weaker when you have multiple walls in between your device and the router.

      "content": "Check to see if you've reached a data cap. Some internet providers enforce a data cap on their customers' internet usage. A data cap limits the amount of information you can download and upload over the internet in the course of a month. Occasionally, they may call this a \"data usage plan\". Log in to your account page, or contact the customer service department to see if you have gone over your monthly allowance. Often, the penalty for going over the cap is decreased speed for the rest of the billing period or extra charges on your bill."

They can usually tell if your connection is substandard without having a technician come to your home by reading signal levels off of your modem. If necessary, they will send a line technician out to your house or neighborhood to check their infrastructure. If the problem is on your end, you might be charged a fee for the visit, so it's important to try troubleshooting over the phone or internet first."

If someone else on your network is downloading a lot of media from the internet, such as watching streaming videos or downloading large files, it is probably using a significant percentage of your bandwidth. If you're familiar with your router's web interface, you may be able to find QoS (Quality of Service) settings to prioritize traffic from certain IPs or service and limit the throughput for others. Otherwise, ask them to keep their downloading habits to a minimum."

Old wireless routers will also have weak antennae, which can leave your devices without a solid connection to the network. All of this combined can lead to sub-optimal speeds when browsing the web. Look for routers from trusted companies such as Netgear, D-Link, Cisco, and Belkin. Make sure that the included antennae are strong enough to reach everywhere that you need. If you are covering a large area with your wireless network, you may need to install a repeater. This will rebroadcast your wireless signal in another area of your home or office, and greatly increases the range of your wireless network."

Your broadband modem will have a harder and harder time 'concentrating' on maintaining a good connection as it gets older (signal to noise ratio will go down, and the number of resend requests for the same packet will go up). An after-market cable modem as opposed to a cable-company modem will frequently offer a better connection. Make sure that any third-party cable modem you purchase will work with your current service provider."
