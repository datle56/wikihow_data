      "title": "Dry your hair before you go to sleep.",
      "content": "Dry your hair before you go to sleep. Going to bed with wet hair can cause your luscious locks to tangle and snarl as you sleep. If you shower at night, use a hairdryer to dry your hair before you lay down. If you like to let your hair air dry, take a shower a few hours before you go to sleep to avoid bed head. [1] X Research source Going to bed with wet hair can also make your bedding moldy and gross. It’s best just to sleep with already dry hair."

    {
      "title": "Brush your hair well before you hop into bed.",
      "content": "Brush your hair well before you hop into bed. If you go to sleep with tangles, you’ll probably wake up with them, too. Run a brush through your hair (unless you have naturally curly hair) to get the snarls out before you head off to dreamland. [2] X Research source If you have naturally curly hair and you don’t brush it, you don’t need to start now. Always brush your hair from the ends up to the roots to avoid ripping or tearing any tangles along the way."

      "title": "Scrunch in a leave-in conditioner to tame frizz.",
      "content": "Scrunch in a leave-in conditioner to tame frizz. If your hair is frizzy when you wake up, it might be crying out for some moisture. Before you go to bed, scrunch a leave-in conditioner into the ends of your hair (not the roots). The extra moisture should help to tame the frizz and keep your hair looking silky and smooth. [3] X Research source Putting conditioner near your scalp can make your hair look greasy, so keep it down on the ends of your hair."

      "title": "Hold short hair in place with a bandana.",
      "content": "Hold short hair in place with a bandana. If you have shorter hair, this one’s for you. Fold a bandana in half to make a triangle shape, then tie it over your hair and behind your ears. The bandana should hold your hair in place overnight to prevent clumps from sticking up in the morning. [4] X Research source Plus, this can prevent frizziness from your hair rubbing against your pillowcase."

      "title": "Pull long hair into a top knot to keep it from tangling.",
      "content": "Pull long hair into a top knot to keep it from tangling. For a simple solution, pull your hair into a loose bun on the top of your head and tie it up with a hair tie or a scrunchy. Leave it slightly loose so you don’t make a mark in the center of your hair, then take it down in the morning. [5] X Research source This is also a great way to protect your curls overnight if you’d like to wear your hair curly in the morning."

      "title": "Braid your hair to create loose waves.",
      "content": "Braid your hair to create loose waves. Split your hair down the center and pull each half into a classic braid. Secure your style with hair ties, then go to sleep. When you wake up, you can undo your braids to reveal your beachy waves. [6] X Research source To amp up your waves even more, spray a little bit of sea salt spray on your hair before you head out."

      "title": "Wrap curly hair in a shirt or a silk scarf.",
      "content": "Wrap curly hair in a shirt or a silk scarf. Flip your hair upside down and wrap a cotton T-shirt or a silk scarf around it. Stand upright and make sure your hair is tucked underneath, then tie the shirt or scarf in the back of your head to keep your hair contained while you sleep. Bonus points if you can keep it on all night! [7] X Research source Keeping your hair in a silk scarf is great for keeping your curls moisturized, and it can help keep them springy and bouncy the next morning. If you tend to toss and turn, you might have a tough time keeping something on your head all night. Give it a try to see how it goes."

      "title": "Sleep on a silk or satin pillowcase.",
      "content": "Sleep on a silk or satin pillowcase. It might seem like a luxury, but using a satin or silk pillowcase really can help you wake up with better hair. That's because they don't create as much friction as cotton pillowcases, so your hair won't frizz as much in your sleep. [8] X Expert Source Christine George Master Hair Stylist & Colorist Expert Interview. 10 January 2020. If you have a silk robe, you can put that over your pillow instead. Using a silk pillowcase is great for naturally curly hair, since it won’t dry out your curls like a cotton pillowcase. If you want to go all out, you can even buy silk sheets—but that really is a luxury!"

      "title": "Use a neck pillow while you sleep.",
      "content": "Use a neck pillow while you sleep. To take the pillow totally out of the equation, try sleeping on a neck pillow instead. Since the pillow only touches your neck and shoulders, there’s less chance that it will mess up your hair as you sleep. Plus, it can give you some relief if you’re having neck pain. [9] X Research source If you find sleeping on a neck pillow uncomfortable, don’t do it. It can be an adjustment, though, so give it a try before you knock it!"

      "content": "Run a humidifier in your bedroom. The extra moisture in the air can help moisturize your hair and leave it looking smooth when you wake up. As a bonus, using a humidifier can be beneficial for your skin and sinuses, too. [10] X Research source This is especially great for curly hair, as it can add a little bit of moisture and hydration to your locks."

      "content": "Tamp down your hair with a little bit of water. Fill up a spray bottle with water from the tap and lightly spritz your hair all over, focusing on the areas that look messy or crumpled. Use your hands or a brush to smooth out your hair and give it a little bit of a polished look before you go. [11] X Research source Try not to make your hair dripping wet, or you’ll have to deal with letting it dry throughout the morning. Use warm or lukewarm water if you take a shower—hot water will create more humidity, which will make your hair frizz.

      "content": "Curl or straighten your hair if you have time. If you wake up and your hair isn’t cooperating, giving it a bit of a style might help. Use your straightener or curling iron to put the oomph back into your locks before you head out the door. You can even give your roots a quick dry with a hair dryer to add some volume back into your hair, too. [14] X Research source You can also use your heat styling tools to refresh your curls or straight hair from the day before if you need to."

      "content": "Throw on a hat or a bandana to cover it up. If you just can’t be bothered with fixing your hair, a surefire way to get going is just to cover it all up. A beanie, a baseball cap, or a bandana can add a funky accessory to your outfit and complete your look. [15] X Research source If you have longer hair, you can pull it into a bun or a high ponytail instead."

The messy look is always in, so you can just say you’re going for that “just woke up and rolled out of bed” look. Be warned, though: this isn’t a great one for a professional setting. [16] X Research source The bed head style is one often sought after by people with short hair. If you already have bed head, you’ve achieved the look all on your own!"
