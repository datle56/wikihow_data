      "title": "Limit your fluid intake.",
      "content": "Limit your fluid intake. The simplest solution to reducing incontinence is to reduce or limit how much you drink. While you should always drink enough water throughout the day to stay healthy, you can consolidate your fluid intake and time it so that your bladder is not as full at night. [1] X Research source Try to consume most of your fluids in the morning and early afternoon so that your bladder will be less full when you go to sleep at night. Never restrict your fluid intake to the point of dehydration. If you feel thirsty or if your urine is dark in color, drink water."

      "title": "Reduce or eliminate caffeine and alcohol.",
      "content": "Reduce or eliminate caffeine and alcohol. Caffeine and alcohol both act as diuretics, which increase your need to urinate. [2] X Research source Caffeine and alcohol can both lead to dehydration as well, which can increase your need to drink water after consuming these chemicals. If you must consume caffeine, try to limit your consumption to the morning and early afternoon. Do not eat or drink anything containing caffeine beginning at dinner time so that any caffeine in your system has passed by bed time. Avoid all caffeine consumption in the evening, as this can increase the chances of bedwetting and also affect your ability to sleep at night."

      "title": "Try to urinate throughout the day.",
      "content": "Try to urinate throughout the day. Some people avoid using the restroom during the day, either because it's inconvenient or because they don't realize they have to go. By forcing yourself to urinate at regular intervals, though, you may be able to reduce your need to urinate at night. [3] X Research source Most people urinate an average of six to seven times within a 24 hour period. [4] X Research source Training your body to urinate every two to three hours throughout the day can help get your body more used to passing urine during waking hours."

      "title": "Urinate twice before you go to sleep.",
      "content": "Urinate twice before you go to sleep. In addition to urinating more during the day, some experts recommend what's called a double voiding before you go to bed. This entails urinating once when you start your bedtime routine (brushing your teeth, putting on your pajamas, etc.) and again just before you fall asleep. [5] X Research source Double voiding may be particularly effective when combined with a restricted fluid intake and more frequent daytime urinations."

      "title": "Wear a bedwetting alarm.",
      "content": "Wear a bedwetting alarm. Bedwetting alarms are equipped with a sensor that detects moisture in your underwear. When the sensor activates it sets off an alarm or a silent vibrational signal to wake you up. You can purchase bedwetting alarms online or through a medical distribution store in your community. While a bedwetting alarm may not be much help at preventing accidents early on, they will help train your bladder over time. With continued use, your body will be able to recognize the signs of a full bladder and wake you up before you have an accident. If you use a bedwetting alarm that makes an audible sound, you may have to explain to your roommate (if you have one) what the sound is. It may be easier to remain discreet if you use the vibrating alarm, as this will not produce an audible sound."

For many adults this problem simply requires some behavioral modification, but many people suffer from underlying medical conditions that can cause incontinence.

      "content": "Take medications. Though there is no simple \"cure\" for bedwetting, there are a number of medications your doctor may prescribe to help reduce urine production and/or control overactive bladder. Some medications may cause side effects, including dry mouth, dizziness, and blurred vision.

      "title": "Consider surgical options.",
      "content": "Consider surgical options. Surgical options are usually considered when other methods have failed. These procedures involve implanting artificial devices or surgically altering your bladder to provide you with better bladder control. [10] X Research source Some surgical options for incontinence include: Sacral nerve stimulation: in this procedure, your doctor will implant a device that stimulates the nerves in your body to help reduce muscle contraction that would otherwise cause incontinence. Clam cystoplasty: during this procedure, a piece of your intestine is surgically implanted in your bladder to increase the size of your bladder and reduce overall bladder activity. Detrusor myectomy: in this surgical procedure, your doctor will remove some or all of the exterior muscle that surrounds your bladder. This can help give you increased control over your bladder functions."

      "content": "Invest in a mattress cover or sheet protector. A mattress or sheet cover will not reduce or prevent nocturnal incontinence, but these items can help make cleanup easier. You can purchase a mattress cover or sheet protector online or at many houseware retailers. [11] X Research source Mattress covers may be made of waterproof materials, like vinyl, or they may be made of absorbing materials. Sheet protectors can be put down over your sheets to help simplify the cleaning process."

      "content": "Try wearing absorbent undergarments. Absorbent underwear can help reduce the risk of urine soaking your clothing and bedding at night. [12] X Research source You can purchase absorbent underwear at your local pharmacy or grocery store, or through an online retailer. Absorbent underwear come in both disposable and reusable forms."

      "title": "Do your laundry regularly.",
      "content": "Do your laundry regularly. The most noticeable consequences of nocturnal incontinence are soiled clothing and bedding. These embarrassing markers of bedwetting can alert others to your problem if they're noticed. The best way to avoid others noticing your soiled linens is by doing laundry frequently and keeping clean clothes and bedding on hand near your bed at all times. If you have one or more roommates, try to do your laundry when they aren't around whenever possible. Don't put off washing soiled linens. Launder your wet clothing and bedding early the next morning before class so that they do not start to smell. Be sure to change out of wet clothing right away to prevent rashes and other skin irritations from developing."

      "title": "Talk to your roommate.",
      "content": "Talk to your roommate. The decision to tell someone about your bedwetting problem is a difficult one. You may feel embarrassed and want to hide your problem, but if you live with a roommate they may realize that you've been wetting the bed. If you decide to talk to your roommate, do so when you're both alone and can have a serious conversation. Remind your roommate that your problem is a medical one. It's not something to be laughed at or joked about. Establish your boundaries with your roommate. If you don't want anyone else to know about your problem, make this clear and ask your roommate to be respectful of your wishes. If your roommate does find out (or if you decide to tell them), reiterate that you're taking precautions and trying to correct the problem. Let your roommate know that they'll never have to directly deal with your problem and that you'll be responsible for handling it."

      "title": "Consider living alone.",
      "content": "Consider living alone. It may not always be feasible, but living alone may make it easier to cope with your bedwetting problem while you get it under control. Ask someone from student housing if it's possible to pay more for your own dorm room, or look into off-campus housing options."
