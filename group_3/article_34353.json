      "content": "Profit Margin refers to the amount of Gold you can make by selling items. In Stardew Valley, most of your Gold comes from growing and selling crops. By lowering the Profit Margin, you are lowering the amount you receive with each of your sales. This includes the creatures you capture via fishing in Stardew . Stardew Valley offers set Profit Margins of 100% (Normal), 75%, 50%, and 25%. If you have your Profit Margins set to 50%, an item worth 60 Gold will now be worth 30 Gold when sold. If you have your Profit Margins set to 25%, an item worth 60 Gold will now be worth 15 Gold, and so on. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Change the Profit Margin if you want a greater challenge. If you're a veteran player or even a new player who enjoys a harder difficulty, you can adjust your Profit Margin at the beginning of a new save file. This will essentially double the amount of time needed to reach any monetary goals. While lowering the Profit Margin will also lower the expenses of seeds, other unlockable items such as the Stable and Inventory expansions will remain the same. It will take you longer to obtain these features as opposed to a normal 100% Profit Margin game. In most cases, save files with normal Profit Margins see growth in Year 2, but lower Profit Margins may take longer. You can only change your Profit Margin when you start a new save file. You'll be unable to officially change it with an existing save file. [3] X Research source"
