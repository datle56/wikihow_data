      "content": "Microbangs are basically extra short bangs. Any bangs that are cut to mid-forehead level or slightly higher can be considered “microbangs.” The general idea is that they sit a few inches above your eyebrows, rather than right at eyebrow level like regular bangs do. Microbangs can be cut and styled in many different ways. Blunt, choppy, texturized, wavy, curly, soft, wispy—the options are endless! [1] X Research source In recent years, you may have seen celebrities like Zendaya, Kristen Stewart, and Zoë Kravitz rocking microbangs, but the style has actually been around for a long time. Microbangs were the signature look of movie star Audrey Hepburn, for example. [2] X Research source What to ask for at the salon: Simply ask your hairstylist for “microbangs” or \"baby bangs,\" and they should know what you mean. They’ll also be able to help you come up with a variation that suits your face shape and personal style, but you can bring photos for inspiration, too. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Blunt, straight-across microbangs This is a classic variation of the look. Just ask your hairstylist to cut your microbangs straight across your forehead at your desired length, and let them know you want them cut in a blunt way (rather than texturized or wispy). According to master hair stylist Nick Arrojo, a straight and blunt bang is the perfect choice if you want to “create the most drama.” Styling tip: For this sleek, polished look, you’ll usually want to blow dry or flat iron your bangs to make sure they sit the right way. [4] X Research source To blow dry your bangs, use your fingers or a hairbrush to push your bangs from side to side while holding the hair dryer above, pointing downward to your face. This will help your bangs dry downward, rather than sticking up! [5] X Research source This type of microbang looks great with long or mid-length hair, and it also works well with shorter styles like bobs."

      "title": "Choppy, texturized microbangs",
      "content": "Choppy, texturized microbangs If you’re looking for something a little more edgy, a jagged and choppy microbang look could be perfect for you. This style looks great with shaggier haircuts, like a wolf cut, mullet, shaggy bob, or even a shaggy pixie cut. Styling tip: To accentuate the choppy look, you can simply add some texturizing spray and let your bangs air dry, or you can use a curling wand to add some volume and a slight wave."

      "title": "Curly microbangs",
      "content": "Curly microbangs If you have curly hair, microbangs could be a super fun style to try out. Curly microbangs tend to have a softer and wispier look than the blunt or jagged variations, so they’re a great option if you want a more feminine or delicate-looking hairstyle. Styling tip: To style curly microbangs and tame frizz, try using some curl-defining cream or mousse . Whatever products you use on the rest of your curls should work just fine! Scrunch the product into your bangs to define your curls, then you can either let your bangs air dry or use a diffuser to amp up the volume. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Super short microbangs Whereas regular microbangs tend to fall an inch or two above your eyebrows, you can ask your hairstylist to go slightly shorter than this. This is a super daring and eye-catching option, so it’s a great choice if you like to take risks and do unique things with your hair. [7] X Research source Just keep in mind that bangs take some time to grow out, so you should make sure you’re totally certain before taking the plunge with this extra-short look! Styling tip: Super short microbangs are a little bit less high maintenance than longer lengths. You can usually let them dry naturally for a more windswept look. However, if you have a tendency toward frizziness, you might want to apply some frizz spray to keep things looking smooth. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Color block microbangs Another eye-catching option would be color block microbangs, which basically means dying the bang section of your hair a bold color, while leaving the rest of your hair your natural shade. This fun look is an awesome way to express your unique style and show off your daring side! Styling tip: Try to pick a color that goes well with the type of clothing you wear. For example, if you wear a lot of pink, a sweet pink shade or soft lilac will probably look amazing with your wardrobe, but if you tend to go for edgier, more gothic ensembles, a bold green, royal blue, or bright red might be best."

Headbands , embellished barrettes or bobby pins , and hats all look great when paired with a microbang hairstyle. Styling tip: If you’re wearing a headband, place it behind your microbangs—they’ll be too short to push back with the rest of your hair, and you’ll likely want to show them off anyway!"

      "title": "Microbangs work well on oval, round, and inverted triangle face shapes.",
      "content": "Microbangs work well on oval, round, and inverted triangle face shapes. This hairstyle tends to look especially good on these softer face shapes, rather than sharper or more angular ones. However, with the right cut and styling, microbangs can work on anyone. For example, a texturized or wispy microbang with some face-framing layers can soften up the look for angular face shapes, like square or diamond. Not sure what your face shape is? No worries! Here’s a short guide to help you figure it out : Round: You have a rounded hairline and jawline, and the width and length of your face are pretty much equal. Inverted triangle: Your forehead and cheekbones are equal width, and they’re wider than your jawline. Your chin also comes to a point (either rounded or more rigid). Oval: Your forehead width is smaller than your cheekbone width, your face is longer than it is wide, and your jaw and chin are more rounded than angular. A combination of the square and round face shapes. Heart: Your forehead is wider than your jawline, and your cheekbones are wider than your forehead. Your chin is narrow with a point, and you have a widow’s peak hairline. Diamond: Your cheekbones are high and pronounced, and they’re slightly wider than the length of your forehead. Your chin is on the narrow side and it comes to a point. Essentially a more angular version of the oval face shape. Square: Your forehead, cheekbones, and jawline are all the same width, and your forehead and jawline both look wide and pronounced. A square face shape is kind of similar to a round face in terms of measurements, but the angles are sharper and less curved. [9] X Research source"

      "content": "Microbangs do require regular upkeep. Since your hair is always growing, you’ll need to see your hairstylist on a regular basis for trims to keep your microbangs and at your desired length. Depending on how fast your hair grows, you’ll likely need to get your bangs trimmed every 4-6 weeks. [10] X Research source They may also require maintenance on a day-to-day basis in terms of styling. Some people find that their microbangs air dry perfectly, but others need to add product and blow dry, straighten, or curl their bangs to achieve the look they want. [11] X Research source All of these factors are important to keep in mind if you’re considering going for this look."

On the one hand, this bold and unique look is a great way to show off your individual style and grab people’s attention.

      "content": "The bottom line? If you're usually not very adventurous with your hair, you may want to start with something less intense, like regular bangs instead of microbangs. However, if you’re comfortable experimenting with your hair and you don't mind a bit of maintenance, go ahead and try them out! Eventually, they will grow, so you’re not stuck with them forever if you don’t like them. That’s the great thing about haircuts—they aren’t permanent!"

If you’re ready to move onto a new hairstyle, here are a few tips to promote hair growth and style your bangs as they grow out: Eating a balanced diet filled with protein and nutrients, avoiding heat styling, and washing your hair less frequently may encourage your hair to grow faster . It may also be helpful to take supplements like biotin and other B vitamins, iron, omega-3 fatty acids, Vitamin D, and Zinc. [12] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Master cosmetologist Shun Pittman recommends trying out sleek updos as your microbangs grow out. “You could use styling products, like gels, pomades, or mousses, to sculpt the hair back,” she says. Pittman also suggests “taking advantage of hair ornaments, like decorative bobby pins or headbands,” to hold your bangs back from your face as they grow."
