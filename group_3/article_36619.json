      "title": "Use a stain-removing laundry detergent to remove stains in the wash.",
      "content": "Use a stain-removing laundry detergent to remove stains in the wash. This is typically one of the easiest ways to get rid of yellow stains. Wash your clothes in the laundry as you normally would, using a stain-removing detergent according to its instructions. It will also help if you pre-treat the stain with a stain remover before laundering. [1] X Research source There are a lot of detergents on the market that will not only remove your stains, but also leave your clothes smelling terrific! Find laundry detergent designed to remove stains at most grocery stores and mass retailers where detergent is sold."

      "content": "Make a baking soda paste for a gentler stain remover. Baking soda is a gentle abrasive that can help remove stains without damaging your clothing. In a small bowl, mix equal parts baking soda and water until it forms a paste-like texture. [2] X Research source Apply it directly to the stain and let it sit for 20-30 minutes. Then, rinse the mixture away with cold water and repeat the process as needed. When the stain has successfully been removed, wash the garment as usual. If you need something a bit stronger, mix equal parts baking soda and hydrogen peroxide instead. Apply the mixture to the stain, scrub it in circular motions with an old toothbrush, and let it sit for 15-30 minutes before rinsing with cold water."

      "title": "Apply white toothpaste to small stains.",
      "content": "Apply white toothpaste to small stains. Grab some white, non-gel toothpaste and apply it to an old toothbrush. Scrub the toothpaste into the yellow spot so it’s fully saturated and evenly coated. Let it sit for about 30 minutes so it sets into the garment, then rinse it with cold water. If the stain remains, reapply the toothpaste and let it sit for a longer period of time. [3] X Research source If you’re in a rush, scrub the area vigorously for 30-60 seconds then rinse with cold water. This may remove most of the stain until you have time to treat it further. Toothpaste often contains hydrogen peroxide or baking soda, which are known to remove stains. Toothpaste with hydrogen peroxide or whitening properties typically works better than natural toothpastes. Avoid using colored toothpaste, since this may actually stain your white clothes even worse! This method typically works well on cotton clothes, but it may not work as well on other fabrics."

      "title": "Use distilled white vinegar for a natural solution.",
      "content": "Use distilled white vinegar for a natural solution. If you’re looking for an eco-friendly cleaning method, the acetic acid in vinegar often helps break down stains. [4] X Research source Combine 1 part vinegar and 4 parts water in a bowl or spray bottle. Apply the solution to the yellow stains and let it sit for about an hour. Then, rinse the garment in cold water and launder as usual. Additionally, add 0.25 cups (59 mL) vinegar to your laundry to both remove stains and soften fabric. Do not add vinegar if you’re using chlorine bleach, however, as this will produce harmful fumes. Note that using vinegar may harm clothes made of silk, acetate, or rayon."

      "title": "Use a hydrogen peroxide solution on stubborn stains.",
      "content": "Use a hydrogen peroxide solution on stubborn stains. If the stains are tough and set-in, mix 3 tbsp (44 ml) of dish soap, 3 tbsp (51 g) of baking soda, and 1/2 cup (118 ml) of hydrogen peroxide (or equal parts of each for really tough stains) in a bowl or spray bottle. Saturate the stain completely and let it sit for about an hour. Then, wash the garment in cold water and let it dry. [5] X Research source Note that there is a small chance that the coloring of the dish soap may discolor your clothes, so use clear, colorless dish soap for best results. If the stain doesn’t come off the first time, a second application will often do the trick. Alternatively, mix equal parts of hydrogen peroxide and water or hydrogen peroxide and baking soda. Use an old toothbrush to apply the mixture to the stain, let it sit for about 30 minutes, then rinse it with cold water and wash as usual."

      "content": "Try lemon juice for a natural bleaching agent. Squeeze some lemon juice (bottled or fresh) directly onto the stained area. Sprinkle a generous amount of salt on top and use an old toothbrush to work it into the fabric in circular motions. Then, lay the garment in the sun to air-dry for a few hours. Rinse the juice and salt away with cold water, then launder as usual. [6] X Research source The sun’s UV rays have natural stain-removing properties that can help the process along. Additionally, try adding 1 cup (240 mL) of lemon juice to your laundry along with your detergent and wash as you normally would. This will not only get rid of stains but will also give your clothes a nice, lemony smell. Don’t use lemon juice with colored clothing, as it could accidentally bleach them."

      "title": "Wash non-delicate clothes with 1 capful of bleach.",
      "content": "Wash non-delicate clothes with 1 capful of bleach. Add a capful of bleach to a load of white clothes along with your detergent. However, bleach can be harsh on fabrics, so make sure your clothes can be safely bleached before washing them. Avoid bleached colored clothes or delicates, and wear gloves when handling the chemical. [7] X Research source Be careful when working with bleach, as the fumes can be harmful. Do not mix bleach with other cleaning products unless you’re 100% certain it is safe to do so. Check your clothes’ tags to see if they can be bleached. A hollow white triangle symbol means they can be bleached and a triangle with diagonal stripes in the middle indicates they can only be treated with non-chlorine bleach. If the triangle has an X, they cannot be bleached at all."

      "content": "Treat stains with crushed aspirin and water if that’s all you have. In a pinch, the salicylic acid in aspirin can remove stains as effectively as vinegar or lemon juice. Crush 3-4 aspirin tablets into a powder, then mix it with 0.5 cups (120 mL) of hot water to form a paste. Rub the paste onto the stain and allow it to sit for 2 hours. Then, wash the stained clothing as normal on a hot water cycle. [8] X Research source Note that the crushed aspirin should only be used on white clothing, as it may discolor your colored fabrics."

      "title": "Use rust remover to remove yellow rust stains.",
      "content": "Use rust remover to remove yellow rust stains. If the stains on your clothes were caused by rust, they can likely be removed by a commercial rust-removing product . Simply add the rust remover to your washing machine as it’s filling with water and let the clothes soak in it for 5 minutes. Then, add your detergent and wash the clothes as normal. [9] X Research source Be sure to follow the usage instructions on the bottle very closely, as rust remover fumes can be dangerous when inhaled. To best protect yourself, wear rubber safety gloves when handling rust remover."

      "content": "Add bluing agent to the laundry to neutralize yellow stains. Bluing agent adds the slightest hint of blue to your clothes, which combines with the yellow hue of the stains to make them white. Mix the agent with cold water per the instructions on the bottle, then toss it into your washing machine with the detergent and wash your stained clothes as normal. [10] X Research source Buy bluing agent at any department store or grocery store that sells laundry detergent. Note that bluing agent isn’t actually a cleaning agent, so while it will offset the yellow hue of your stains, it won’t do anything to make them cleaner."

Add 0.5 cups (120 mL) of borax to your laundry along with detergent at the beginning of the wash cycle to remove odorous stains. [11] X Research source Borax is also a great multipurpose cleaner you can use to clean the inside of your car, your pet’s bedding, and even the washing machine itself!"

[12] X Research source Use a stain remover of your choice and apply it according to its instructions. Pay special attention to areas on your white shirts like the collar, under the arms, and the wrists. Then, wash the garment as usual. If there are stains, it’s best to treat them as soon as possible to increase your chances of removing them."

      "content": "Try an aluminum-free deodorant. Your sweat alone isn’t what causes yellow “sweat” stains on your clothing. These stains often occur when the chemicals in sweat react with the aluminum in deodorant. This reaction then sticks to the fibers of your shirt and the stains get set in when the garment goes through the dryer. If you get sweat stains frequently, consider switching to an aluminum-free deodorant. [13] X Research source"
