      "content": "Give yourself rules about how much you can do. Your impulse might be to say “yes” to everything. This can result in you becoming exhausted, overbooked, and stressed out. Instead of defaulting to “yes,” be prepared to say “no.” You can do this by creating a structure for how you spend your time. [1] X Trustworthy Source Greater Good Magazine Journal published by UC Berkeley's Greater Good Science Center, which uses scientific research to promote happier living Go to source Maybe you are cranky if you go out more than two evenings in one week. If this is the case, create a rule for yourself that two nights is your limit. If someone asks you to do something after your limit is reached, you'll feel justified saying no. You can also apply this to other situations. For example, agree to only participating in one fundraiser a semester at your child's school. Set a limit of meeting someone for lunch only one day during the workweek. Try to balance your schedule. On days when you have a lot of work responsibilities, schedule some time for self-care when you come home."

      "content": "Schedule your time carefully. Account for all of your activities. For example, if you plan to grocery shop on Saturday morning, mark it on your calendar. That way, if someone asks you to fill in as soccer coach on Saturday morning you can legitimately say that you already have something on your calendar. [2] X Trustworthy Source Greater Good Magazine Journal published by UC Berkeley's Greater Good Science Center, which uses scientific research to promote happier living Go to source You can even schedule things like alone time for yourself. This method can help you make sure that you get everything done that you need (or want) to do. Of course, if something important comes up, you can always be flexible and make an exception. For example, if you need to visit the dentist, you might have to cancel your relaxing Saturday morning."

      "content": "Stick to your priorities. You can't do everything, so it is important to be able to give a respectful “no.” Write down your priorities each day, and commit to getting them done. If someone asks you to do something not in line with those goals, you can say no. [3] X Research source For example, maybe your list says, “finish presentation for Monday, write objectives for next week's department meeting, leave on time for Aunt Ruth's birthday dinner.” If a coworker asks you to stay late to help them with their own project, it is okay to say, “I'm sorry, I have a family commitment this evening.”"

You can ask them if they'd like to join you in your class! You don't have to say yes every time someone asks you on a date. Even if you're in a relationship, you still need some alone time. You can say, \"Thanks for asking, but I really just feel like staying home alone.\" If your partner pressures you, you may want to reassess your relationship. Of course, you will sometimes have to do things that you don't feel like doing. But don't feel like you have to attend every work happy hour just to be polite. Give yourself some time before you answer. It can sometimes take a few hours or even a day to think about an invitation. Take some time so you can determine if it fits your schedule and priorities."
