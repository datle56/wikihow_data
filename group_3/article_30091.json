      "content": "Moisten a clean washcloth and place it in a plastic bag. Soak a washcloth in water so that it’s dripping wet. Then, place the cloth in a resealable plastic bag, like a Ziploc bag. Fold the cloth neatly to ensure it will heat up evenly when you put it in the microwave. Do not seal the bag at this point. [1] X Trustworthy Source Arthritis Foundation Main organization devoted to arthritis support and education Go to source If you don’t have a Ziplock bag, try the bundle method. Gather two or three washcloths and soak them in water. Wring out the excess and wrap or fold the cloths together to form a multilayered bundle. Place the bundle in a bowl covered in plastic wrap."

      "content": "Microwave the bagged washcloth for 30-60 seconds. With the bag open, place the bag and the towel in the center of the microwave. Heat on high for 30-60 seconds, adding time in 10-second increments until it reaches your desired temperature. [2] X Trustworthy Source Arthritis Foundation Main organization devoted to arthritis support and education Go to source If you’re using the bundle method, heat the bowl for about 2 minutes."

    {
      "title": "Carefully remove and seal the bag.",
      "content": "Carefully remove and seal the bag. Because the washcloth was saturated with water, there may be scalding hot steam coming from the bag. Carefully remove it, using a pair of tongs if it’s too hot to touch, and seal the bag to keep the steam and heat inside. This prevents the warm compress from cooling too rapidly. Again, be careful not to burn yourself—cover your fingertips with another washcloth or a pair of oven mitts when sealing the bag. [3] X Research source Hot steam can seriously burn the skin even if you don’t directly touch the hot object. If you’re using the bundle method, exercise the same caution when removing the compress from the bowl."

      "title": "Wrap the compress and place it against your skin.",
      "content": "Wrap the compress and place it against your skin. Your compress will be too hot to place it directly against your skin, so wrap it in a clean towel to form a barrier. Allow the compress to cool if it feels uncomfortably warm, then place it against your injury for no more than 20 minutes at a time. Check on your skin every few minutes to make sure it doesn’t get burned. [4] X Research source Place the plastic bag in the center of the towel, then fold the towel around the heated material. Do so in a way that prevents the bag from sliding out of the towel and only leaves a single layer between the compress and your skin. If your skin starts to look dark red, purplish, spotty red and white, blistered, swollen or you develop hives, call your doctor. You may have skin damage from the heat. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Soak a towel in hot water as an alternative. If you don’t have a microwave or feel uncomfortable microwaving plastic, fill a bowl with hot—not boiling or scalding—water, then soak a clean towel in it. Wring out the excess water, fold the towel, then apply it for 10 minutes. This method has fewer steps, but it can lose heat more quickly than the microwave method. [6] X Trustworthy Source University of Rochester Medical Center Leading academic medical center in the U.S. focused on clinical care and research Go to source If you place the towel directly against your skin, be extremely careful that the compress is not too hot. This type of warm compress is helpful for sinus pain, but be aware of the risk of burns. Or, heat some water in a kettle, then place a washcloth in a bowl and carefully pour the water over it. Use tongs to insert it into a plastic bag to make a warm compress. If you use this method, be sure to wrap the compress with a barrier so it isn’t too hot against your skin."

All you need for the basic dry compress is a clean tube sock and some dry, uncooked rice, beans, or oats to go inside it. [7] X Research source However, if you want to give the compress a pleasant fragrance, you’ll also need a little bit of powdered peppermint, cinnamon, or whichever aroma you’d prefer. Use some herbs from your kitchen, the contents of an herbal tea bag, or essential oils. Try adding relaxing lavender, chamomile, sage, or mint to your compress for an even more soothing experience."

Add a few small pinches of your fragrant powder or herbs so there will be a pleasant aroma throughout the compress. Leave enough sock material on the end to tie a knot. [8] X Research source If you plan on sewing the end of the sock to make a permanent warm compress, you can fill it nearly to the top instead."

      "content": "Seal the open end of the tube sock. Depending on how long you want to keep your compress, you can seal the sock temporarily or permanently. Tying a firm knot into the sock will keep the contents in place for a short period of time and allows you to reuse the sock later. Or, sew the open end of the sock together to create a permanent compress. [9] X Research source Sealing the sock very close to its contents will make for a hard compress, while sealing it far away will leave its contents loose. Experiment with how hard or soft you want the compress before sealing it. If you leave the contents a little looser, you can easily drape the sock over your neck and shoulders to treat pain there."

      "content": "Moist compresses are more effective than dry compresses. While both moist and dry warm compresses can relieve issues such as sore muscles and cramps, studies have shown that moist compresses are more effective. The moisture helps retain heat so you don’t have to reheat as often, and it helps the heat penetrate the muscles to increase blood flow.

      "content": "Apply heat to sore muscles. Sore muscles are often the result of excessive lactic acid buildup in the muscle tissue. When you use a warm compress to treat a sore muscle , the heat draws more blood to that area. The increased circulation flushes away excessive lactic acid, making your muscles feel less sore. It also brings more oxygen to the area, spreading up the healing process for damaged tissue, and the warm sensation distracts the nervous system to decrease the amount of pain signals sent to the brain.

      "content": "Treat joint stiffness and arthritis pain with heat or cold. Both heat and cold can be effective in treating joint issues and arthritis pain , though some people prefer one over the other. Cold compresses numb soreness and reduce inflammation and swelling in your joints by constricting blood vessels. Warm compresses dilate the blood vessels, increasing blood flow to speed up the healing process. Heat also loosens the tissues and ligaments in the stiff area, increasing their range of movement. Consider alternating between heat and cold until you figure out which one works better for you. [17] X Research source You can also apply heat by soaking the affected area in warm water. This might mean swimming in a heated pool or simply soaking in a warm bath."

Do not use heat within the first 48 hours of an injury, whether it’s a sprained muscle or a cut. Instead, apply a cold pack to reduce pain and inflammation. [20] X Trustworthy Source University of Rochester Medical Center Leading academic medical center in the U.S. focused on clinical care and research Go to source Heat is best used to treat chronic issues, like ongoing muscle soreness, spasming, or chronic joint pain. If you pull a muscle or have another acute injury, apply a cold compress immediately to reduce the swelling within the first 48 hours. If the pain persists for several days, use heat to speed up the recovery process."
