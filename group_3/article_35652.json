      "content": "Ask about laser treatments. If your keratosis pilaris is very bothersome and doesn’t respond to other treatments, your doctor might suggest laser treatments or light therapy. These treatments can help reduce discoloration and improve your skin’s texture. They work best when combined with other treatments, such as microdermabrasion. [10] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Dermatology Professional organization made of over 20,000 certified dermatologists Go to source Another option is photodynamic therapy (PDT). Basically, this treatment uses light combined with a photosensitizer that you apply to your skin to work on the condition. However, using it for keratosis pilaris is an off-label use, so it may not be covered by your insurance. [11] X Research source While laser and light-based therapies may improve the appearance of your skin, they won’t actually cure keratosis pilaris or related conditions."

Your doctor may prescribe a retinoid, such as tazarotene, which you typically apply to your skin every night.

      "content": "Take baths and showers in lukewarm water. Do not use hot water when bathing or showering, as hot water dries out the skin and causes this particular skin condition to worsen. In addition, limit how long you are in the shower, as showering strips your body of its natural oils. But don't let this discourage you from showering. It's important to maintain good hygiene.

[15] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Avoid bar soaps, which can be drying.

When you get your body wet, you need to be applying a moisturizer. Washing skin can remove natural oils, and applying a moisturizer immediately can help trap the water near your skin, providing moisture. [18] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Dermatology Professional organization made of over 20,000 certified dermatologists Go to source Apply your moisturizer while the skin is still damp, just after showering. Many of the medications used to treat keratosis are drying. Always moisturize after applying an acid lotion, retinoid, or urea cream or ointment. If you're having trouble with dry skin, pick a moisturizer that includes an oil or fat to help moisturize your skin.
