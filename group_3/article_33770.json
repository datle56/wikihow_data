      "content": "Silence after a breakup means cutting all contact with your ex. When you go through a breakup, you might be tempted to text or call your ex in the aftermath, either to get closure or to try and reconcile. However, staying in contact while the breakup is still raw can make healing more difficult, whereas going radio silent and cutting all contact can help you and your ex come to terms with what happened. [1] X Research source Radio silence is a common tactic to use after breakups. You can use it to move on from your ex, or you can use it to get your ex to miss you so they eventually re-establish contact."

      "title": "Many people use the “no-contact rule” in the wake of a breakup.",
      "content": "Many people use the “no-contact rule” in the wake of a breakup. The no-contact rule is a popular post-breakup technique that relies on the power of silence. The goal of this rule is simply to distance yourself from your ex, not calling, texting, or initiating any kind of contact for a set amount of time after a breakup. After the allotted time passes (and if you want to), you can re-establish contact with your ex. [2] X Research source A typical no-contact period lasts between 30 and 60 days. Try going radio silent for 30 days if you want to get your ex back. Alternatively, consider going silent for 60 days if you just want to move on."

      "title": "Radio silence allows you to reflect on the breakup.",
      "content": "Radio silence allows you to reflect on the breakup. Continuing to talk to your ex post-breakup is a surefire source of heartache. Going silent gives you space to calm down, clear your head, and reflect more objectively on why things didn’t work out. Figure out what went wrong, what went right, and what lessons you can carry with you into your next relationship. [3] X Research source Objectivity is key! Look for mistakes you made, too, and not just mistakes on your ex’s part. The more you reflect, the better you’ll understand what really happened. When you understand the causes that led to your breakup, you may be able to do things differently in the future."

      "title": "You’ll have time to process your feelings and heal.",
      "content": "You’ll have time to process your feelings and heal. It’s hard to heal from the pain of a breakup when you’re still in contact with your ex—after all, you’re constantly reminded of them. Going radio silent can help you turn your focus away from your ex and onto the healing process. A no-contact period is a great opportunity to do things that make you feel happy and spend time with your support system! [4] X Research source There’s no concrete timeline for healing from a breakup, so be patient with yourself , take it one day at a time, and remind yourself that the pain is temporary. It won’t last forever. It’s also important to get in a better mindset before jumping back into dating. Starting a new relationship too soon can turn it into a rebound, whereas silence will help you start your next relationship with a clean slate."

      "title": "Silence can help you feel empowered and confident.",
      "content": "Silence can help you feel empowered and confident. Breakups can definitely impact your self-confidence, especially if your ex was a big source of encouragement. Silence is super important because it gives you a chance to build that confidence back up without having to worry that a random interaction with your ex will bring you back down. [5] X Research source When you go radio silent, you’re making the choice to cut contact with your ex. Realizing you’re strong enough to do that can really boost those feelings of empowerment! Remember that relationships do not determine your worth. Breakups happen when two people realize they aren’t compatible; it’s not about who you are as a person."

      "title": "Your ex is more likely to miss you after you go no-contact.",
      "content": "Your ex is more likely to miss you after you go no-contact. Remember the saying, “Absence makes the heart grow fonder”? Well, that’s often very true. Silence gives your ex a chance to notice your absence and really miss having you around. If you stay in touch with them during the aftermath of the breakup, they might not get the chance to miss you properly. [6] X Research source When you don’t call, text, or ask to see them, your ex is more likely to start wondering what you’re up to. Eventually, when their curiosity gets the better of them, your ex might even take the next step and contact you—rather than the other way around. From there, you can decide whether you want them back in your life.

      "content": "You can control when you talk to your ex again. Choosing to go silent after a breakup puts you in control of the situation because you have the power to re-establish contact with your ex or move on entirely. Breakups can make you feel helpless, especially if your ex was the one who ended things, so taking back control through silence can be a helpful way to cope. [7] X Research source"

By taking your time and opting for silence instead, you’re showing your ex that you aren’t desperate—and that you respect yourself enough not to rush the healing process after your breakup.

No matter how badly you want to move on, seeing and speaking to your ex regularly ensures that some part of you keeps hoping for a reunion.

      "content": "Decide how long you want to maintain radio silence. If you opt for silence, it’s a good idea to figure out how long you want to cut contact with your ex. You might decide to wait a month, a couple of months, a year, or drop all contact for good if the breakup was especially bad. The important thing is that you give the no-contact period enough time to work and don’t re-establish contact too early. [10] X Research source Wondering when is too early to contact your ex after a period of silence? There’s no hard and fast rule; check in with yourself and evaluate how you feel about the breakup every so often. Generally, if you feel like going radio silence hasn’t worked yet (and you’re still feeling bad about the breakup), that’s a good indication you might need to give it some more time."

Remove the temptation to call your ex after the breakup by erasing their number. Even if you know their number by heart, you’re still more likely to catch yourself before calling them if you must manually type in the number. [11] X Research source If you aren’t sure you want to lose their number completely, write it down on a piece of paper and give it to someone you trust for safekeeping. That way, you can’t use it, but it’s not gone forever."

Block them on all your accounts—Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and so on—so you can’t get messages from them or see their posts and photos. Stalking your ex’s social media profiles will only make the breakup feel worse and prolong the healing process.

      "content": "Steer clear of public places your ex often visits. You probably remember many of your ex’s favorite places to spend time, and your ex likely recalls yours as well. To avoid accidental encounters with them (and to resist the urge to look for them when you’re out and about), stay away from the places your ex most commonly frequents, if possible. [13] X Research source You don’t have to walk on eggshells or look over your shoulder constantly to avoid your ex; just play it cool and find alternative places to go if you know where your ex usually is at a particular time."

It can be tempting to reach out to your ex’s friends in the hopes that they’ll tell you about your ex and how they’re doing, but it’s best to keep your distance. Asking around your ex’s friend group can make you look a little desperate and probably won’t help you reconcile with your ex any faster. [14] X Research source If you and your ex have mutual friends, that’s a different story. You’re definitely not obligated to cut off a good friend just because they know your ex! Instead, you might set some boundaries with mutual friends and ask them to steer clear of mentioning your ex around you for a while."

Sharing them with your ex can lead to more turmoil, and bottling them up isn’t healthy, so try keeping a journal instead. Write down all of your feelings about the breakup, especially when you feel tempted to text your ex. [15] X Research source For example: Think about how you’ve been feeling lately and keep a record of your moods. Reflect on the problems and major issues from your relationship and write about them. Consider what you’ve learned from the relationship. What changes can you make in future relationships? Have your standards for a romantic partner changed at all?"

Breakups are jarring and painful, so sticking to a routine can maintain a sense of normalcy in your life.

When your ex abruptly disappears from your life after a breakup, it’s easy to feel lonely—but that’s just another reason to indulge in self-care and live life to the fullest. Do things that make you happy, including making time for your favorite hobbies, spending time with your best friends, and pampering yourself from time to time. [17] X Research source For example, you could set aside a couple of hours each day to play games if you’re a big video game fan or invite your friends for a night out if you’re feeling lonely. You could pamper yourself with a luxurious, spa-quality bubble bath or just curl up on the couch with a favorite snack and one of your comfort TV shows."

Then, take the time to honestly think about how you may want to move forward in the future and why. [19] X Research source Ensure you’re moving on—or reuniting with your ex—for the right reasons, and ask yourself questions like: “Do I really want my ex back, or am I feeling lonely?” “Will contacting my ex help either of us right now? Is it possible they might still need time to heal too?” “Why am I reaching out to my ex? Am I setting myself up for more pain?” After you’ve thoroughly analyzed your thoughts and feelings, you can make an informed decision about how to move forward."
