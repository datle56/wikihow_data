      "content": "Pour more water on the fire. After you've stirred the fire thoroughly, you'll want to add more water to it to extinguish any remaining embers that may have come off burning pieces of wood."

      "content": "Feel the logs and coals to make sure they aren't hot. Put your palms up next to logs and coals. If you don't feel any heat radiating off of them, you can touch them with your hands. Any warm or hot pieces of your fire must be doused down with more water."

      "content": "Repeat the steps until the fire is cool to the touch. Continue dousing the area and mixing the soot and embers to ensure that you've put out the fire fully. The fire is fully extinguished when it's completely cool to the touch. The rocks surrounding the fire should be cool to the touch when the fire is fully extinguished."

      "title": "Wait until the fire dies down.",
      "content": "Wait until the fire dies down. Plan on leaving the campsite when your fire completely dies down. Do not add logs to your fire if you know you are leaving soon so that the fire can stop burning. If you need to extinguish the fire quickly, this is not an ideal method. Instead, use water to put out your fire."

      "title": "Mix the ashes together with a stick or a shovel.",
      "content": "Mix the ashes together with a stick or a shovel. Use a shovel or a long stick to poke the embers left over in the fire. Uncover large unburnt logs or sticks to make sure that there are no embers remaining under the ashes."

      "title": "Stir dirt or sand into the embers.",
      "content": "Stir dirt or sand into the embers. You just want enough dirt or sand to smother the embers and to extinguish the fire fully. Do not cover or bury the fire, as this could create a fire under the surface of the dirt that could reignite later and will make the sand or dirt incredibly hot."
