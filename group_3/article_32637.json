      "content": "A personal year number is a prediction based on your birthday. This number is calculated using the digits of your birthday and the current year. Your own number changes every year, and that change is said to alter your upcoming year’s vibrations and energies. By calculating your personal year number, you can use that number to predict those energies and act accordingly. Think of it like a weather forecast for the whole year. [2] X Research source Some believe your personal year number changes on your birthday, while others believe it changes on January 1 of each year. Follow whichever system feels right for you—there’s no “wrong” method!"

      "content": "Add the digits of your birth date to the digits of the current year. To calculate your personal year number, take the digits of the day and month you were born, then add them to the sum of the digits of the current year. [3] X Research source For example, if you were born on August 24, you would add 8 + 2 + 3, which is 14. Then, if the year is currently 2023, those digits add to 7 (2 + 0 + 2 + 3). Finally, add 14 to 7 to get 21. Some numerologists also add the digits of your birth year. Again, do whatever feels the best to you, energy-wise."

      "content": "Simplify the number to a single digit by adding its digits together. Many numerologists believe that you progress along a 9-year cycle, with each year marking a different stage of growth. [4] X Research source To align your number to this cycle, take the number you found in the previous step and simplify it to a single digit by adding its digits together again. So if the number was 21, then 2 + 1 = 3, meaning that your personal year number for this year would be 3. That said, don’t reduce the number to single digits if it’s 11, 22, or 33. These are “master numbers” in numerology, and have special significance."
