      "content": "Ask yourself questions about who you are to spark self-reflection. Rogers suggests taking an “internal inventory” to identify all the wonderful traits you have that you could cultivate more, as well as any negative traits that may be holding you back from being the best version of yourself. You can also ask yourself about your values, hopes, fears, and past experiences. Here are some examples: What are my strengths? What positive traits come naturally to me? Do I have any negative traits I could work on? What would I change about myself if I could? How would the people closest to me describe me? Am I more of an introvert or extrovert? What are my moral and ethical values? Do I live my life according to my values? What acts of kindness have I done for others recently? What do I find inspiring? What am I most afraid of? What is my most cherished memory? What’s the hardest lesson I’ve learned so far? What worries me the most about the future? What would I do if I wasn’t afraid of failing? What in my life do I take for granted? What are the biggest challenges I face in life? Am I true to myself, or do I hide parts of myself from others? If today was the last day of my life, how would I spend it? Do I push myself out of my comfort zone enough? Do I care too much about what others think of me? Am I holding myself back in any way? What’s most important to me? What do I desire most out of life?"

Analyzing your connections with your loved ones is a hugely important part of personal growth, Rogers explains. It helps you understand how you express affection and handle conflict, and what matters to you in interpersonal relationships.

How do I show support to my friends? What’s a kind thing I’ve done for a friend recently? How would my closest friends describe me? Which of my friends could I actually trust with my life?

      "title": "Take a “fear Inventory.”",
      "content": "Take a “fear Inventory.” When Rogers has clients who are looking to engage in some self-reflection, she suggests an exercise called a fear inventory. “It’s an exercise where you keep track of anxieties, insecurities, or doubts that come up for you when you’re trying to make an important change in life,” she explains. You can keep track of these things on a piece of paper, in a journal, or even in your notes app on your phone. In doing this exercise, you’ll usually be able to pick out a common thread that’s held you back at different points in your life. “It’s a powerful moment when you understand, ‘Oh, this is my pattern,’ or ‘This is a fear that I continue to come back to.’ And when you can name it, it’s easy to change it,” Rogers says."

      "title": "Identify what’s in your control and out of your control.",
      "content": "Identify what’s in your control and out of your control. When you start a journey of self-reflection and personal growth, “It’s important to know what we have control over and what we don’t,” Rogers explains. “So if a client came to me and said, ‘I really need to make some changes, and I need to do some reflection on where I am and where I wish to be,’ I would ask the client to identify some things that they can change, and some things that they may have to surrender along the way.” For example, Rogers gives the example of a client who wants to lose weight. “I would say, ‘What are some things you can do for yourself to change your physical health? And what are some things that you need to surrender, that you don't have control over, and therefore shouldn't be too focused on?’” “And so their answer might be, ‘Well, I can go to the gym, I can create an exercise routine, those are things that I can change for myself. I can't change how quickly the weight falls off, and I can't control how much weight will fall off.’ That kind of exercise can really be helpful in a very realistic practical way,” says Rogers."

      "title": "Have an internal dialogue with yourself.",
      "content": "Have an internal dialogue with yourself. “One other exercise that's fun is called a voice dialogue,” Rogers says. “It's basically having a conversation with two different voices in your head that may be in conflict with each other. For example, say someone wants to make important changes when it comes to navigating family dynamics. On the one hand, they know that they need to put up better boundaries, but on the other hand, they feel really guilty about it. It'd be a conversation between these two voices,” Rogers explains. You can imagine this back-and-forth dialogue in your head or write it out in a journal. Rogers has even had clients who take more creative approaches to the exercise. “I've had clients pull out sock puppets. I've had clients create a screenplay. It's a really fun exercise, and it's just for the sake of understanding what it is that’s blocking you, where you feel conflicted,” Rogers says."

      "title": "Identify times when you were “in the flow.”",
      "content": "Identify times when you were “in the flow.” If you’re hoping to grow professionally , Klaphaak recommends looking back and identifying \"the moments when your innate strengths were coming through.\" According to Klaphaak, these are examples of being in the flow. \"They don't have to be big flashy achievements— they could be small things that went unrecognized, like supporting a friend through a challenge in their life,” he explains. “What's important is that you felt like you were in your element, at your best, doing something that came naturally to you.” Klaphaak suggests writing a reflection about each of the experiences you identify. “Ask yourself what strengths you used in these experiences, and notice which strengths show up repeatedly - those are likely to be your core strengths, the ones that you want to make sure to use in your career,” he says."
