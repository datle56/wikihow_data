If you plan on cooking in your first week, then you’ll need to unpack and arrange the kitchen as well.

Include kitchen utensils such as dishes, glassware, silverware, cookware, appliances such as a toaster or blender, a garbage can, and dishwashing products. [12] X Research source Ask family members if they have any of these items that they’re willing to give away to help you defray costs. You may also want to write down simple food items including spices, oils, vinegar, and noodles or canned goods to be sure you have these items as soon as you want to cook. You’ll need office and lighting supplies including paper, light bulbs, and lamps and basics such as toilet paper and light bulbs. [13] X Research source Make sure that you list bathroom products as well. Don’t forget basics such as toilet paper, body wash or soap, hand soap, a plunger for clogs, towels, a bath mat, and a shower curtain. Prioritize the list according to what you absolutely need and what you want. For example, do you need more picture frames or do you have enough until you can save some money?

      "content": "Furnish your apartment within your budget. Every apartment requires basic pieces of furniture for you to live comfortably. Buying furniture at a discount or getting it for free will help you stay within the budget you set. Shop at sales and look in thrift or second hand stores for cheap, good quality furniture or lamps. Remember to inspect furniture carefully for rips and insects, especially when buying secondhand. Try to spend a little bit more on furniture if you will use it every day. Getting a good or decent quality bed or sofa will save you money in the long run because you won’t have to replace shoddy merchandise. Ask family members or friends if they have any furniture they’d like to give away or which you can purchase inexpensively. You don’t have to buy every piece of furniture you need immediately. Think about what you will use most like a bed or sofa and purchase those pieces first. Add to your furniture as you can afford."

      "content": "Put up decorations as you have time and money. Give yourself plenty of time to decorate your new apartment. Moving is stressful and taking the time to make your place cozy and familiar will help relax you and make you feel settled. Create a timeline for yourself if you like. Tackling one room at a time is a good strategy and finishing two rooms per week should suffice. One of the easiest and least expensive ways to decorate a new apartment and add some atmosphere is to paint. Make sure you're allowed to paint inside your apartment, and then use color on one wall or a couple of walls to accent your home. Hang familiar paintings, photographs and decorations. These will make you feel more at home and are an inexpensive way to jazz up your space. Carpets and rugs can enlarge or make a space feel more cozy, and can also dampen noise. Add small touches such as plants or candles. For example, placing a row of candles across a table or buying a few inexpensive plants and plant pots can add a lot of atmosphere to your apartment. Remember that everything doesn’t have to match. It often looks much cooler and homier to have furniture and decorations that complement one another but don’t match exactly."
