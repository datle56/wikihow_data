      "content": "Take your mattress off your bed. Raising your bed frame will be much easier with the mattress off, because the frame will be lighter. Take your mattress off, with the help of your roommate if you want, and lean it against the wall out of the way.

      "content": "Unhook the frame by tapping underneath the corners with a rubber mallet. Tap upwards at the corner of the bed frame where the horizontal part of the frame slots into the bed legs. Do one corner at a time. Have a friend hold up the bed frame as you loosen it so that it doesn’t fall down. [2] X Research source You can usually borrow a rubber mallet from your housing office."

      "title": "Move the frame up to the position you want and slot all four corners in.",
      "content": "Move the frame up to the position you want and slot all four corners in. You will definitely need a friend to help you with moving the bed frame to the right position. Make sure that all four corners of the frame are fully slotted into the right position on your bed. You should hear a clicking noise as the hooks on the corners of the bed frame slot into the legs of the bed. [3] X Research source If you can’t get the corners of the bed frame completely slotted in with just your hands, hammer them down with the rubber mallet."

      "title": "Replace your mattress.",
      "content": "Replace your mattress. Put your mattress back up onto your bed frame and put on your sheets and blankets. Once your bed is raised, you can store more things underneath it, like a chest of drawers or a laundry hamper. If it turns out you don’t like the new height of your bed, you can always adjust it again."

      "content": "Get a lofting kit from the housing office. This kit should include 2 extra bed legs and 4 pegs. Sometimes lofting kits also come with a safety rail and a ladder to help you get into your bed once it’s lofted. [4] X Research source [5] X Research source Most schools don’t make you pay extra for this lofting kit, but you should ask to make sure."

With the help of a friend, tip the bed frame onto its side. [6] X Research source Make sure you have plenty of room to work on the bed frame. You may want to move the bed frame from its original position and out into the center of your dorm room to be able to work on it more easily. [7] X Research source"

The holes on the top of the new legs should fit perfectly onto the pegs. [8] X Research source It’s helpful to have a friend at one side of the bed while you work on the other so you can slot the legs in at the same time."

To keep yourself from falling out of your lofted bed, attach a safety rail on the side of the bed that won’t be protected by the wall. Usually, the safety rail just slots into the bed frame.

      "content": "Get pegs for bunking your bed from the housing office. You can’t just stack one bed on top of another and hope for the best––not only is it risky, but most schools don’t allow it. You need pegs to secure the top bed to the bottom bed, so that there’s no chance of the beds becoming separated. Get pegs from the housing office of your dorm. [9] X Research source If you’re not sure where the housing office is for your dorm, ask a residential assistant or someone else on your hall who has already bunked or lofted their bed."

Decide which bed will be the top bed, and take the mattress off of that one. You can leave the mattress on the bottom bunk, because you won’t have to move that frame. A convenient place to put the top mattress is on top of the bottom one."

Put one in each corner, so that you use all 4 pegs. Always use all 4 pegs, because if you use less, your bed will be unstable."

      "content": "Lift the top bed with a friend and slide the frame onto the pegs. Lift the top bunk above the bottom bunk. Be sure to lift with your legs, not your back, to avoid injuring yourself. Line up the top bunk exactly over the bottom bunk, and slide the frame down onto the pegs. You have to lower all four legs down at the same time to get them all onto the pegs."

To help keep whoever is in the top bunk from falling out, attach a safety rail to the edge of the top bunk that’s not against the wall. Usually, safety rails have little hooks on the bottom that you can slot over the metal edge of your bed frame. If you don’t have one in your room already, borrow it from the housing office."

      "content": "Buy risers in the height you want. Risers usually come in 3 or 5 inches (7.6 or 12.7 cm). If you want to raise your bed higher, get stackable bed risers, so that you can stack the 3 and 5 inches (7.6 and 12.7 cm) for 8 inches (20 cm). [10] X Research source When deciding what height you want to raise your bed to, balance the benefit of extra storage space with the extra difficulty of climbing onto a high bed. You can buy bed risers at a home supply store or online."

      "content": "Lift up one corner of the bed at a time while your friend slides a riser underneath. Continue until all four risers are underneath the bed. Make sure that all four risers are the same height, so that your bed is level. If your bed is too heavy to lift, take off your mattress and put it someplace out of the way. Replace it once you're done."

      "content": "Store more things under your bed once it’s raised. Having some extra room under your bed is very helpful in the tight space of a dorm room. Make full use of the extra space by storing dresser drawers, suitcases, a laundry basket, shoes, or whatever else you want. Stacking items underneath your bed or keeping them organized in bins will help you save space."
