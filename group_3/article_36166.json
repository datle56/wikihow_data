      "content": "Gather any required materials. The materials you may need are as follows: An anti-static wristband . Even if you're working on a non-carpeted floor, an anti-static wristband is still a good idea to avoid creating static electricity that could short out your computer. A new CMOS battery if you're replacing it. A flathead screwdriver to pry the CMOS battery out of your motherboard. A flashlight, especially if you're not in a well-lit area."

      "content": "Open your computer case. How you open your PC case may vary slightly depending on your case model, but in general, you remove the thumbscrews on one of the side panels and slide the panel off of the case. The side panel you want to remove is most likely the right panel. However, if your computer is set up differently, you'll want to remove whatever panel will get you access to the inside of the case."

      "title": "Press the metal lever next to the battery.",
      "content": "Press the metal lever next to the battery. Many motherboards have a small metal lever next to the CMOS battery that can be pressed to pop the battery out of the motherboard. However, if yours doesn't have that or it's not working, you can very gently use a flathead screwdriver to pry the battery out of the motherboard. If you're trying to reset the BIOS, wait a few minutes before reinserting the battery."

Whether you are placing the old CMOS battery back in the case or a new one, all you need to do to replace it is to set the battery over the battery slot and then press it into place. You may feel the battery click into place. Don't press too hard to avoid damaging the board. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "The CMOS battery allows your computer to retain some data between restarts. Most notably, the CMOS battery allows your computer to remember the date and time even when it's turned off. It also stores your BIOS/UEFI settings and helps your computer maintain a low-power state when it is asleep or hibernating. [2] X Research source"
