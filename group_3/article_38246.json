      "title": "“Shukran” (شكراً) translates to a simple “thank you.”",
      "content": "“Shukran” (شكراً) translates to a simple “thank you.” You can say this phrase in all Arabic-speaking countries , in both formal and informal settings, by speakers of any Arabic dialect. “Shukran” is derived from the root verb “shakara,” which means “to thank.” Say “shukran” as a brief, casual comment when someone helps you out. [1] X Research source Reply to \"shukran\" with \"al-’awfoo\" (العفو) or \"‘af-waan\" (عفواً)— these phrases typically mean \"you're welcome,\" \"no problem,\" or \"no need to thank.\" A more precise translation for \"afwaan\" might be either \"you're pardoned (from saying thanks)\" or, to convey the underlying humility, \"pardon me from (hearing) thanks.\" Interestingly, the specific nuance and feeling conveyed by these phrases often depends on the speaker's tone and context."

      "content": "“Ashkuraka” (أَشْكُرُك) lets you give someone a quick \"thanks.\" Even though it’s one quick comment, it’s used in a formal context. When you’re speaking to colleagues or your elders, say \"ashkuraka\" to build rapport and express respect. A response to \"ashkuraka\" that's just as short is \"ahlan wa sahlan\" (أهلًا و سهلًا), which simply means \"welcome.\" [2] X Research source Tanween ( ـً , ـٍ , ـٌ ) is the addition of one of three vowel diacritics (harakat) to the end of a noun or adjective. It's used to indicate the word ends in a nasal sound without adding the actual letter \"nun\" (ن). Notice how in the words ‘سهلًا’ (Sahlan), ‘أهلًا’ (Ahlan), and ‘مرحبًا’ (Marhaban), the nasal ‘n’ sound is present even though the letter (ن) is not included in the written word."
