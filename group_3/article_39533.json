      "title": "Fill a large plastic bin with warm water into your bathtub.",
      "content": "Fill a large plastic bin with warm water into your bathtub. The plastic container is necessary because the dye in many leather jackets will bleed when soaked in water and could ruin the finish on your tub. For the same reasons, you should wear rubber gloves to prevent dye from getting on your hands. [2] X Research source You can purchase the plastic bins online or at most major department and hardware stores. Purchase a tub that's at least 33 gallons (125 liters) or big enough so you can submerge your entire jacket. You should fill the container up half way, or enough so that you can fully submerge your jacket under water."

      "title": "Submerge your jacket in the water and rub out the dye.",
      "content": "Submerge your jacket in the water and rub out the dye. Keep the jacket submerged under water for five to ten minutes. Some of the dye should naturally leak out of your jacket. Rub a sleeve over the entire surface of your jacket and allow more of the dye to bleed out. This process will make your leather absorb more water and will promote shrinkage.

      "content": "Wring the water out of the jacket. Once your jacket is finished soaking, take it out of the plastic bin and wring it out. Make sure to do this over the plastic container or the jacket's dye could create a mess. Get as much water out if as you possibly can before moving onto the next step."

      "title": "Let your jacket dry on a towel for two days.",
      "content": "Let your jacket dry on a towel for two days. Lay out a fresh towel and drape your leather jacket over it. As the towels become soaked by the jacket, make sure to replace them and turn your jacket over so that the entire thing can dry. Keep your jacket in a dry area. If you put it in sunlight or another heat source, it will shrink your jacket faster but will also make it much smaller. You can also use a hairdryer to achieve faster results. Be aware that this may cause the jacket to shrink more. As long as your jacket isn't suede or nubuck, you can put it in the dryer on high heat for 30 minutes to shrink it. However, this will change the texture of your jacket, giving it a puckered look. [5] X Expert Source Mallika Sharma Certified Leather Care Technician Expert Interview. 14 December 2020."
