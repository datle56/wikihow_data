      "content": "It could mean that the person texting you is thinking about you. Maybe the person was trying to fall asleep, and you kept popping into their mind. If that’s the case, they’ll probably text you something innocent, and it can be a fun way to start some late night flirting with the person you like. If the text is innocent, like, “Hey, thinking about you ,” or, “Can’t sleep. What are you up to?” then it’s probably not a booty call."

      "title": "It could mean they want to hook up.",
      "content": "It could mean they want to hook up. People typically text others after dark when they’re looking to hook up. If you want a strictly sexual relationship with this person, go for it! But, if you’re looking for something more serious, a late night text might be a red flag.

      "content": "If you're down for some late-night chatting or flirting, go for it! If the person texting you really does just want to chat, go for it! You can text them back and talk about how you can’t sleep, either. Ask them what they’re doing up, how their day was, and what they hope to dream about. This is a fun way to grow closer together, and it can keep you occupied until you fall asleep. For instance, if they text you, “Hey, I can’t sleep.” You might say, “Weird, me neither. Maybe we’re both thinking about each other too much.” Or, if they say, “Hey, just thinking about you,” you might say, “Wow, you read my mind. Is that why you aren’t asleep yet?”"

      "content": "If you're not interested in hooking up and you think it's a booty call , don't respond. Accepting a booty call can make the other person think you don’t want a serious relationship. [2] X Research source By ignoring the message, you’re telling the person that you’re not down to do anything—and that’s totally fine. Simply ignore the message and continue on with your night. [3] X Research source Unfortunately, responding to a booty call can sometimes blur the lines between friendship and committed relationship. This often leads to a “situationship,” where you’re hooking up with someone, but you’re not really sure what your label is. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "“Hey, it’s really late.” Let this person know that they probably shouldn’t have texted you this late at night. By sending this message, you can signal to them that their message isn’t well-received, without being rude or causing offense."

      "title": "“Sorry, I’m sleeping.”",
      "content": "“Sorry, I’m sleeping.” If you get woken up, try this message. They’ll probably text back something like, “Oh, my bad.” Then, you can fall back asleep and not worry about replying. This is also kind of a cheeky way to let someone know that they shouldn’t text you so late at night."

It’s totally valid for you to want to get to know them more before doing anything sexual, so just let them know. Hopefully, they’ll be understanding.

Uber?) and also if it’s worth the trek (if they live an hour away… maybe not). Either way, getting their address is the first step toward accepting a booty call."
