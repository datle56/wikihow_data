Only 7% of our daily communication is verbal. 55% of our communication comes from body language . [1] X Research source Before initiating any kind of move, look for body language clues such as prolonged eye contact and positive facial expressions to help you work out whether you'll get a positive response. A woman may expose certain areas of her body like her neck or wrists, and may play with her hair.

These may include resting an arm on the back of your chair, engaging in strong eye contact, and sitting or leaning close to you."

You may notice that you are 'mirroring', which is the subconscious copying of the actions of the other person's body positions. When someone smiles at you, you tend to smile back. Flirting is a way of mirroring each other's actions. Try to see if you're on the same wavelength by doing an action. If the other person mirrors you, great. If she doesn’t, go back to mirroring her to create a bond. [5] X Research source"

This doesn't mean you have to spill all the personal details of your private life in one conversation, but being direct and straightforward about what you look for in a partner, your outlook on life, etc, illustrates self assurance and self knowledge.

Pay attention to your partner's reactions, and adjust your actions accordingly. You should both be giving your consent to the first move in either a verbal or physical way. It doesn't matter what the other person said or did earlier; consent is always about that exact moment.

Light touches and closer body contact will not only make your intentions clear, but can give you an idea of the other person's interest. Make sure to go slow enough to give the other person time to say no. You want to have a fun, consensual, and safe time with each other. This includes making the person feel comfortable. If the person isn't ready to take it as far as you are, then respect her wishes. Make sure you have protection. This one seems like a no brainer, but if you're preparing for a first move, always have condoms on hand (regardless of your gender, women should bring their own, too!). Part of having an enjoyable time together is ensuring you're both safe and comfortable, so always use protection.
