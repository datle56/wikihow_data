      "content": "Find an appropriate moisturizer. Once you know your skin type, there are a few basic categories into which your skin will likely fall. Most skin will range from ‘oily’ to ‘dry,’ with ‘normal’ between the two. The other two main categories are ‘sensitive’ and ‘mature.’ Moisturizers for dry skin are generally petroleum or oil-based. Oily skin calls for a water-based moisturizer. It should also be noncomedogenic to prevent your pores from clogging. [2] X Expert Source Adarsh Vijay Mudgil, MD Board Certified Dermatologist & Dermatopathologist Expert Interview. 8 October 2020. Normal skin also needs a water-based moisturizer, but one which contains some oils, though much less than dry skin needs. Sensitive skin needs a moisturizer with medicinal or soothing properties. Look for moisturizers with chamomile or aloe, but stay away from those with fragrances, dyes, or acids. Try out body butter for a natural, oil-based option."
