According to palmistry, those who have a simian line possess a strong blend of mental and emotional powers. They don’t separate logic from feeling—they fully embrace both. [1] X Research source As a result, this palm marking is thought to be a sign of a visionary personality. The simian line is a pretty rare palm feature—only about 1 out of 30 people have it! In medicine, a single palmar crease is sometimes linked to genetic conditions like Down syndrome and fetal alcohol syndrome. It is possible, however, to have a simian line without having one of these conditions. [2] X Research source"
