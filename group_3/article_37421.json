      "title": "Offer a brief apology.",
      "content": "Offer a brief apology. If the person’s response stemmed from an oversight on your behalf, then it might be a good idea to apologize. For example, you prepared cookies with gluten for someone who has celiac disease, or you hand-painted a wall art canvas saying \"Home is wherever I'm with you\" to someone who just announced a divorce. Don’t be too hard on yourself, and, certainly, refrain from over-apologizing. Say, “Gee, I didn’t realize…” or “I’m sorry, I forgot about your condition.” Keep it short and sweet and change the topic. [1] X Research source Or, you could turn it around and say something like, “Let me make a gluten-free dessert for you next week.”"

[2] X Trustworthy Source HelpGuide Nonprofit organization dedicated to providing free, evidence-based mental health and wellness resources. Go to source Let's say, you presented your gift to a friend only to have it tear up, break, or be completely useless. You gave it your best shot, but your skills just weren't up to par. Graciously laugh it off rather than making the receiver have to nurse your wounds. You may even be able to convince them it was a gag gift after all by following with a just-in-case present. You might say, \"Yikes! Well, when I knitted this, I imagined it actually fitting--not simply going over only one arm...Maybe I just started a trend!\" or you could follow with \"Just joking! Here's your real gift...you do like scented candles, right?\""

      "content": "Remind them of its usefulness. Sometimes, people aren’t receptive to gifts because they would have preferred something else. Maybe your daughter wanted the latest technology gadget for her birthday so she is underwhelmed by the carefully-knitted sweater you gave her. Or, perhaps a co-worker would have enjoyed a gift card, but you presented a more practical gift of handmade kitchenware. Simply because it’s not exactly what they wanted doesn’t mean that your gift is any less helpful. Try not to let their indifferent reaction make you forget that. You might say, “I know this may not be what you wanted, but I heard you say a while back how you needed these…” [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Check if any modifications would increase its appeal. In some cases, the slightest tweak could turn an unsatisfactory gift into a personal item that someone cherishes forever. Find out what the person dislikes, and see if you can make the desired alterations. For instance, if you made a dress for your mother that resembles a tent, take new measurements in order to bring in the seam. If it fits her better, she might be pleased after all.

      "content": "Recommend for them to see if anyone else wants it. If all else fails, don’t allow your hard work to go to waste. Politely suggest that the person re-gift the item to someone they think might enjoy it. That way your handmade gift finds an owner who will justly treasure it. ”Well, if you’re not a fan of this green scarf, feel free to re-gift it to someone else. Maybe Sarah? This green would really complement her eyes.”"

      "content": "Accept the gift back, if necessary. Don’t spend much too time trying to convince someone of the gift’s usefulness or appeal. If they refuse the gift, simply say, “Okay,” and accept it back. Move on from the situation and try not to let it bug you."

      "content": "Resist jumping to conclusions. So you presented a gift and the receiver didn't really respond how you expected them to. Before you overreact, consider that you are bound to attach more meaning to something you made yourself than to something you purchased from a store. It's possible the person could actually like the gift and simply not know how to express their gratitude. Or, maybe that jaw-drop symbolized them being amazed that you crafted something so perfectly \"them\"—not astonishment that you would give them something so horrific."

So, remember it’s the thought that counts. Being too frustrated with yourself places you in the category of bad gift-giver. [5] X Research source Getting caught up in whether someone actually likes your gift detracts from the point of giving. Don’t attach too much meaning to someone disliking the gift. Just be grateful that you were able to give. Besides, some people are just really hard to please."

      "content": "Reap the benefits of giving. Becoming distraught because the person didn’t like the gift takes away from the positive gains you get from giving. The act of gift giving is a way for humans to show appreciation and gratitude for another person. In fact, researchers have found that givers receive even more positive benefits than those who receive. Giving is typically a selfless act. In addition to boosting your connection with others, you feel grateful for having the ability to give and you can even start a chain of giving, in which others are inspired to follow your lead. What’s more, being generous even has a positive effect on health. Science shows us that giving can lower stress, increase immunity, and lead to a longer life.

That’s perfectly normal and human. Be kind to yourself in this moment and attend to your feelings. Take some time alone to lick your wounds and show compassion to yourself. If you have a desire to cry, do so. If you feel slightly embarrassed, acknowledge it. Give yourself a hug, and repeat, “You are a caring, compassionate person. Even though you didn’t get the reaction you hoped for, you still did a good thing.” [7] X Trustworthy Source Greater Good Magazine Journal published by UC Berkeley's Greater Good Science Center, which uses scientific research to promote happier living Go to source"

      "content": "Be mindful of the possible reasons why a gift may be returned. The reason a particular gift may be returned is unique to the person receiving the gift and the circumstances. Their rejection or return of your gift could be a message they are trying to send you, or they may be acting in your best interest. Some common reasons why people decline gifts could include: They just do not like it. It didn’t fit. They already have a gift exactly like the one you gave. They feel the gift was too intimate and inappropriate and don’t share the same feelings. They live minimally and don’t like to collect material things. They feel you are trying to change their views or reform them."

Why not suggest to your friends and family to host a \"Yankee Swap\" or \"White Elephant\" exchange next year? These gift-giving games are light-hearted ways to get rid of undesirable gifts in a fun and relaxed environment. These games involve regifting tacky or off-the-mark gifts or selecting a price range to purchase new gifts. All the gifts are placed in a pile and every attendee gets a number. The first person goes to the pile and selects a gift, and so on until everyone has a gift. The fun part is, at the end, you can choose to exchange with someone if you'd prefer their gift. This is an exciting way to go about gift-giving, without all the pressure."

      "content": "Consult with the person beforehand for guidance. Your gesture could have fallen flat because you were more intent on it being a surprise rather than seeking any involvement from the other person. When a gift requires a lot of time, energy, or money to make, get the intended receiver’s opinion to verify you’re headed in the right direction. For instance, you might ask the person’s favorite color, scent, or fabric to guide your designs without giving away what you’re making. Or, you might be straightforward like, “Hey, Randy, I wanted to demonstrate my pottery skills and design you a vase. Do you have any preferences on colors or shapes?” [9] X Research source"

While you may have put your best foot forward, the end result may have fallen short. If your handmade gift was one of few in the early stages of learning a craft, it may be best to hold off on gifting these items until you have increased your mastery."
