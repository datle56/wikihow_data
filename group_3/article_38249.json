Even though it's not very formal, you can still use it when talking to anyone in any context and it will be considered appropriate. [2] X Research source German culture is very polite and formal.

Some other ways to say \"thank you very much\" in German are: [3] X Research source \"Vielen Dank\" (FEE-lehn DAHNK): literally, \"many thanks\" \"Tausend Dank\" (TOW-zent DAHNK): literally, \"a thousand thanks,\" similar to saying \"thanks a million\" in English"

When you say \"Ich danke Ihnen\" (ick DAHNK-uh EEN-ehn) you're literally saying \"I give you my thanks\" while also indicating profound respect for the person you're thanking. [4] X Research source This phrase is one of the most formal ways to say \"thank you\" in German.

      "content": "Switch to \"Vielen Dank für alles\" to thank someone for multiple things. The phrase \"vielen Dank für alles\" (FEE-lehn DAHNK fewr AHL-lehs) literally means \"thanks for everything.\" If someone has helped you out in multiple ways, or over the course of a long period of time, this phrase is appropriate. [5] X Research source This phrase may also be appropriate in situations where, for example, you're checking out of a hotel, because the hotel likely performed many different services for you during your stay."

The phrase \"Danke für Ihre Gastfreundschaft\" (DAHNK-uh fewr EE-reh GAHST-froynd-shahft) essentially means \"thank you for your hospitality.\" Whether you were a guest a hotel or in someone's home, this phrase is useful if you want to specifically thank someone for being warm and welcoming during your visit. [7] X Research source The same phrase can also be translated to mean \"thanks for your help\" or \"thanks for your efforts.\" The use of \"Ihre\" is formal. If you want to speak more casually, you might say \"deine Gastfreundschaft\" (DIH-neh GAHST-froynd-shahft) to mean \"thank you for your hospitality,\" or \"deine Hilfe\" (DIH-neh HILL-feh) for \"thank you for your help.\""

This phrase means \"thank you for the lovely gift.\" [8] X Research source While in person, a simple \"danke\" might suffice, this phrase is most appropriate if you're sending someone a thank-you card, email, or letter.

In that situation, you can use the phrase \"Danke im Voraus\" (DAHNK-uh ihm FOHR-ows), which literally means \"thank you in advance.\" [9] X Research source As in English, it generally isn't considered appropriate to use this phrase if you have any doubts about the person fulfilling your request.

The phrase \"danke, gleichfalls\" (DAHNK-uh GLIHSH-fahltz) is actually a combination of thanks and a return of the same to the other person. If someone gives you a compliment, tells you to have a good day, or the like, this phrase is appropriate. [10] X Research source For example, as you are checking out of a hotel, the clerk might say \"Ich wünsche dir alles Gute,\" or \"I wish you all the best.\" You could then respond \"Danke, gleichfalls,\" or \"Thanks, same to you.\""

If someone says \"danke schön\" or \"danke sehr\" to you, feel free to use the corresponding response. You can also use them in response to a simple \"danke\" if you want to express more emphatically that whatever you did was not a problem for you. A server or retail clerk might also use these phrases when you say \"danke.\" In that context, they're essentially telling you that they were simply doing their job and there was no need for you to thank them. However, that doesn't mean you should actually forego a respectful \"danke\" to people in the service industry."

However, keep in mind that this is a very casual expression that should only be used when talking to people you know very well, or people who are your age or younger. Note that the word \"Problem\" is not pronounced the same as it is in English. The \"o\" and the \"e\" are pronounced longer, and the emphasis is on the second syllable (proh-BLEHM). The word \"kein\" is pronounced \"kine.\""
