    {
      "title": "Blot the stain.",
      "content": "Blot the stain. You may feel the need to panic and wipe up the stain, but resist that temptation! Wiping up the stain without the use of a cleaner can lead to an even bigger stain. If possible, blot up some of the ink with a paper towel. Just press the ink stain until you can’t remove any more of the ink with blotting alone."
    },
    {
      "title": "Apply the toothpaste to the stain.",
      "content": "Apply the toothpaste to the stain. The kind of toothpaste you use to brush your teeth should work just fine—unless you use gel toothpaste. In that case, get some basic toothpaste that can even be bought from the dollar store. Put the toothpaste directly on the ink stain. [1] X Research source Find a toothpaste that is labeled for whitening or has baking soda in it. This helps clear the stain."
    },
    {
      "title": "Rub the stain with a cloth.",
      "content": "Rub the stain with a cloth. Okay, now you can start wiping instead of blotting. First, dampen a clean, soft cloth. Rub the stain for a few minutes. You’re ready to stop rubbing when the cloth slides over the wood with ease. [2] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Rinse off the wood.",
      "content": "Rinse off the wood. Check the wood out to see if most or all of the stain is gone. Then, rinse off the rag you just used to clean the floor. Use that same cloth to rinse off the floor. Wipe off the wood until there isn’t any toothpaste left on the floor. Use a towel to pat off the wood until it is dry."
    },
    {
      "title": "Repeat the process if necessary.",
      "content": "Repeat the process if necessary. Look over the result of your hard work. At this point, the stain should be completely gone. If not, don’t stress! There are other things you can do. You can repeat the process until you get the result you want. Or, you can use a stronger chemical to get the job done. [3] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Pour isopropyl alcohol on a cloth.",
      "content": "Pour isopropyl alcohol on a cloth. You can begin with a milder method, or start with this one if you don’t want to take your chances on leaving the stain for too long. It’s also an option to use a clear alcohol, like vodka, if you don’t have isopropyl alcohol around. Just try not to drink any of it while you clean. Nail polish remover and hydrogen peroxide will work similarly to isopropyl alcohol."
    },
    {
      "title": "Test the surface of the wood.",
      "content": "Test the surface of the wood. Don’t start working on the stain just yet. Instead, find a hidden or small spot on the wood floor. Dab the cloth on a very small spot to make sure it doesn’t damage the wood. If it does, abandon this method now. It’s okay. There’s another way to remove the stain. [4] X Research source It is still an option to use the alcohol even if it does slightly discolor the wood. You could just sand it down and go over the floor with a wood stain to make it like new again."

    {
      "title": "Wipe off the stain with a cloth and isopropyl alcohol.",
      "content": "Wipe off the stain with a cloth and isopropyl alcohol. Use the cloth that has been dampened with isopropyl alcohol to begin scrubbing off the stain. You’ll know the alcohol is working if the stain begins to transfer to the cloth. Continue to scrub until the stain is gone and relief begins to wash over you. [5] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Rinse and dry the wood.",
      "content": "Rinse and dry the wood. Once the stain has been scrubbed off, rinse off the wood. You can pour some water on the wood and dry it off with a towel. Or, wet a fresh cloth and then let the wood air dry. You’re done! Sit back and relax. [6] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Choose laundry or swimming pool bleach.",
      "content": "Choose laundry or swimming pool bleach. Bleach is a strong chemical, but it’s definitely an effective method for stain removal. Keep in mind that this may lead to some discoloration, but that can be fixed. A basic laundry bleach can be used, but it may not be strong enough to remove a deep stain. A swimming pool bleach, like Shock Treatment, is stronger and more likely to work."
    },
    {
      "title": "Mix the bleach with hot water.",
      "content": "Mix the bleach with hot water. At this point, it’s a good idea to put on a pair of rubber gloves for protection. Take a cup, bucket, or something you won’t be drinking out of, and fill it with hot water. Pour the bleach crystals in the water until you have a saturated mixture."
    },
    {
      "title": "Apply the solution to the stain.",
      "content": "Apply the solution to the stain. Pour some of the bleach mixture directly on the ink stain. Apply the bleach with a soft cloth if you’re nervous about pouring too much bleach on the floor. Let it sit for about 10 minutes. It should work quickly. If not, try again. And if you still see the stain, let it sit overnight.

      "title": "Neutralize the bleach with vinegar.",
      "content": "Neutralize the bleach with vinegar. After you’ve applied the bleach, pour a little bit of distilled white vinegar on top of the (formally) stained area. This will neutralize the area where you applied the bleach. Basically, it will keep bleach droplets from rising to the surface after you’ve finished cleaning."

      "content": "Apply a light wood stain if necessary. This is one of the weaker wood bleaches, but you still might notice some discoloration. Again, don’t panic. Sand down the area and apply a light wood stain. Then, reapply the finish. Your floor should look like new again."
