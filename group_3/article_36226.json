If you live in a state with these requirements, make sure that the electrologist's license is on display when you visit the office. If your state doesn't require licensure, choose an electrologist who has obtained certification from an accredited electrology school.

      "content": "Ask about sanitary procedures. Since electrolysis leaves your skin vulnerable to infection, ask the electrologist what procedures the clinic practices to protect its patients. Do they wear gloves? Do they use proper sterilization procedures, such as wiping down all equipment with sanitizer or using individual needles for each client? [9] X Research source Look around while you're in the office. Ask yourself if the office and exam rooms seem neat and clean. Do the technicians and staff seem to be practicing sanitary methods? Check to see if the technician washes their hands before examining your skin. Most importantly, ask yourself if you feel comfortable. If the answer is no, keep looking. [10] X Research source"

      "content": "Be prepared for several sessions. Each individual treatment session may take only a few minutes or up to an hour, depending on how many individual follicles must be treated, but electrolysis often requires 10-12 treatments over a period of several months for desired results to be achieved. The appointments should be scheduled no closer than 1-2 weeks apart so that your skin has time to recover. [11] X Research source"

Dehydrated skin is more difficult to treat with electrolysis, so make sure you drink a full 8 glasses of water the day before your appointment. Hydration will help your skin to heal more quickly, as well, so keep hydrating after treatment. Avoid caffeinated drinks the day of your appointment as they can increase your skin's sensitivity."

      "content": "Wash your face with a gentle cleanser prior to treatment. Electrolysis can leave your skin vulnerable to infection as you recover, so it's important to make sure to thoroughly wash your face before treatment. Use a gentle cleanser and a light moisturizer. Avoid harsh skin care treatments prior to electrolysis. Chemical peels, waxes, and other facial treatments can leave your skin feeling sensitive. This can lead to an uncomfortable reaction to the electrolysis treatment, so avoid these treatments for about a week prior your first treatment. Since your followup appointments will probably only be 1-2 weeks apart, wait until you have finished electrolysis completely before resuming these treatments. [13] X Research source"

You can also bring headphones and listen to your favorite music. During the procedure, the electrologist will insert a very thin needle into the hair root, then remove the hair using tweezers. This process takes about 15 seconds per hair follicle. You may be given a topical numbing cream, or you can take an over-the-counter pain reliever prior to your appointment if you are concerned about discomfort."

Use a lightweight lotion to make sure your skin gets plenty of moisture. This will help it to heal faster, help prevent scabbing and will relieve discomfort."

      "title": "Do not touch or scratch your skin after treatment.",
      "content": "Do not touch or scratch your skin after treatment. Electrolysis leaves the hair follicle exposed for a short time after treatment. Touching or scratching your face can transfer bacteria to your vulnerable skin, leading to breakouts and infection. Try not to touch your face for the first 1-2 days after treatment. If you do need to touch your face, wash your hands first. If scabs form, allow them to fall off naturally. Picking at them can lead to scarring. If there are scars because hair is removed again and again from the area, you can use bleaching-type creams, such as hydroquinone.

Sun exposure on recently treated skin can lead to a form of discoloration known as hyperpigmentation. You should always wear sunscreen with an SPF of at least 15 when you will be out in the sun, but it's especially important for the first 1-2 days after electrolysis,"
