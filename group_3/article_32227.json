      "content": "Remove your old polish. The first thing to do is remove any polish that's already on your nails. Soak a cotton ball with nail polish remover and run it over your nails until all the polish is gone. A cotton swab can help with hard-to-reach edges. When choosing nail polish remover, be aware that those with acetone are more effective, but also more likely to damage your hands. Non-acetone nail polish removers are less strong, but also less harmful. [1] X Research source There are also alternate options for nail polish remover. Moisturize your hands to counteract the drying effects of the nail polish remover."

      "content": "File your nails. Get your nails to the desired shape. Be careful not to leave jagged edges, as they can uncomfortably scrape against shoes and socks. Make sure your nail file is in good condition and hasn’t become dull. The best filing technique is not to move your nail back and forth over the file, but to scrape the file in a single motion across the tip of your nail and repeat until you’ve finished.

      "content": "Buff the tops of the nails. The nails on your toes are usually rougher than those on your fingers since they're always rubbing against socks and shoes. Use a nail buffer to smooth down ridges and grooves. Buffing helps remove any residuals left by your old pedicure and primes the nail to soak up the base coat. [4] X Research source"
