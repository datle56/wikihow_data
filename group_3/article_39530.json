      "content": "Check the tag on your jacket to see if it is machine-safe. The tag can tell you if the jacket is safe to wash in a washing machine and whether or not it has been pre-shrunk. This could limit how much further it can be shrunk. [1] X Research source The tag will also tell you the blend of the jacket. If it is not 100% cotton, that could affect how much it can be shrunk as well."

      "content": "Turn the jacket inside-out to prevent fading. Jean jackets can fade after repeated washes. The easiest way to prevent fading is to simply turn the jacket inside-out. Button up or zip up the jacket so that it closes correctly after it has been shrunk."

      "title": "Place the jacket inside the washing machine by itself.",
      "content": "Place the jacket inside the washing machine by itself. Even if you plan to shrink more than one garment, wash your denim jacket by itself to achieve the best results. This will ensure an even soak and thorough wash cycle. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Set the washer to the highest water temperature.",
      "content": "Set the washer to the highest water temperature. Hot water contracts the cotton fibers and will cause the jacket to shrink. Set the dial on your washing machine to the highest possible temperature setting. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Add color-safe detergent to the washing machine. Detergent can help to ensure that the jacket doesn’t fade in the wash. Not to mention, it will make your jacket cleaner and softer! Use ¼ the recommended amount of detergent for a full wash since you are washing the jacket by itself."

      "content": "Wash the jean jacket on the longest wash cycle. The agitation and time spent in the hot water will start to shrink the denim. The longer the exposure to the hot water, the better the shrink. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Hang the jacket to dry. It may only take one hot wash cycle to shrink your jacket down to the size you want it to be. So allow the jacket to hang dry, then try it on to check the fit. Remember, it’s much easier to shrink something again than it is to unshrink it!"

If your jean jacket didn’t shrink quite enough after washing and hang-drying, you can dry it on high heat to shrink it further. [5] X Research source Keep it turned inside-out to prevent the color from fading. Run the dryer for one hour. Be careful, as the buttons or metal trim on the jacket will be hot after drying."

      "content": "Repeat the process as needed to shrink the jacket to the desired size. The more you wash and dry on high heat, the more your jacket will shrink. But be careful! The more you wash and dry denim, the more it will lose its shape, color, and elasticity. [6] X Research source You do not need to add detergent for repeat cycles. Pre-shrunk denim may take more than one cycle to shrink to the right size."

      "content": "Place the jacket in the pot, reduce the heat, and simmer for 30 minutes. Denim is a sturdy material that will take a little bit of time to shrink. It is important that the whole jacket is submerged in the boiling water to ensure even shrinking. [7] X Research source Use a wooden spoon or utensil to submerge the entire jacket."

You can wash the jacket, boil it, or apply hot water to prepare it to be shrunk. If you are trying to shrink a specific area, like the sleeves or shoulders, spray or apply hot water to that area."
