      "content": "Use search engine operators to get the right results. Search engine operators are special characters understood by search engines to help you be more specific about what you're looking for. Here are some examples: [1] X Research source If a set of words belongs together in a phrase, such as a quote or a certain type of object, put quotes (\") around them so Google knows to only search for exact matches. This is great for when you know a few lyrics to a song and want to search them to find the song's name. Type a minus sign (-) in front of a word that you want to omit from your search results. For example, if you want to search \"nano\" but don't want results for the iPod Nano, you would search for nano -iPod . Common words, such as \"how\" and \"the,\" are usually overlooked during a Google search. If these words are essential to your search, put a plus (+) symbol in front of them. To search social media sites like Twitter and Facebook, put an @ symbol before the search term. For example, @wikihow . If you'd only like to see results from a certain website, put site: in front of your search terms. For example, if you want to search for \"iOS 13\" on wikiHow, you would type: site:wikiHow.com \"iOS 13\" . To find an item in a certain price range, use this syntax: synthesizer $300..$700 . This example would display synthesizers that cost between $300 and $700."
