      "content": "You’ll earn the most points when you’re close to the kitchen line. The kitchen, or non-volley zone, is the area of the court that extends 7 feet back from the net on both sides. When you and your partner are at the kitchen line, it may force your opponents to play defense and allow you to set up offense opportunities. [1] X Research source The closer your toes are to the kitchen line, the more likely you are to score . Be careful not to step over the line into the non-volley zone, as you’ll lose the point on a fault. Since you’re closer to your opponents, the rallies will speed up. Keep your paddle up and stay vigilant to avoid taking a ball to the face! If you’re getting ready to serve, your partner will already be at the kitchen line. Immediately move forward as soon as you’ve returned the serve to put pressure on your opponents."

      "content": "Aim toward your opponent’s feet to throw them off balance. Most pickleball players favor their forehand and position themselves accordingly. [2] X Research source If you target their backhand, and specifically toward their feet, they’ll be forced to turn their bodies to get the ball, which could pull them out of position and allow you to put the return away. Hitting a shot in the middle toward one player’s backhand can cause confusion so that neither player hits the ball properly. This tip is especially useful for singles where there is more opportunity to hit the backhand."

      "title": "Keep your opponents away from the kitchen.",
      "content": "Keep your opponents away from the kitchen. Because most points are scored by the players at the kitchen line, you want to keep your opponents as far away from it as possible. Forcing them back to their baseline means they’ll have to hit shots that are more difficult and out of their comfort zone. Here are some tips for how to force the other team back: [3] X Research source Hit your serves as deep and close to the baseline as possible. Return serves with arc and as deep as possible so your opponent has to wait longer for the bounce to return it. This also gives you more time to get to the kitchen line and go on the offensive. Hit to the player who is farther back on the court, and aim at their feet. Mix it up with a fast-paced serve now and then. Consider adding spin to catch your opponent off guard. Be sure you’ve practiced these moves before the game, though, or it might not work in your favor."

      "title": "Hold your paddle up close to your chest.",
      "content": "Hold your paddle up close to your chest. By keeping your paddle up, you’ll have a quicker reaction time, which will increase your chances of hitting the ball. Don’t let it drop to your stomach or side between shots. Be prepared to hit any ball coming your way. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Hit a dink to slow down the game.",
      "content": "Hit a dink to slow down the game. A dink is a pickleball shot executed from the kitchen line that arcs low over the net into your opponents’ kitchen. When hit properly, the ball will bounce in the kitchen so that your opponents can’t hit it without letting it bounce first. Your opponents will have to work for their next shot since dink shots have very little power. [5] X Research source Try dinking cross-court/diagonally instead of directly to the opponent in front of you. This gives you more court to work with and will allow the ball to cross the net at its lowest point in the middle. Dinking like this can be difficult for beginners, but hitting diagonally will give you an additional 8 inches of height to work with and increase your chances of success. Start practicing!"

      "title": "Deliver your serve correctly to get the upperhand.",
      "content": "Deliver your serve correctly to get the upperhand. In pickleball, it’s important to get your serve in for 2 reasons: you only get one serve and you only score points when you serve. Practice different types of serves like average- and fast-paced, serves with high arcs, and serves to different targets. Find what works best for you to make sure you get your serve in. [6] X Research source If you want to try a risky serve, don’t do so if you’re your team’s second server. If you miss, it’ll be like handing your opponents the ball and allowing them to score."

      "title": "Try to hit the ball into the open court.",
      "content": "Try to hit the ball into the open court. Sideline shots have a low percentage of success. If you’ve forced your opponents to one side of the court, aim your shot away from them into the middle of the court, as you’re more likely to score. Be careful not to rush these shots, however, as you can over-hit them and cause them to go out. [7] X Research source"

      "title": "Focus on blocking until your opponent has a weak shot.",
      "content": "Focus on blocking until your opponent has a weak shot. You can be on offense or defense at any time during a rally. In fact, you’ll probably play both multiple times throughout a rally. Pay attention to what “mode” you’re in so you know which shots to take and how to make the most of your opportunities. Here are some tips for different positions: [8] X Research source If you’re on the kitchen line and your opponent is mid-court, you’re probably on offense. Your opponents are more focused on blocking your shots and defending themselves than trying to attack. When on offense, keep up the attack until you have an awkward shot. Then, be prepared to go on defense immediately as your opponents will likely take advantage. Watch for weak shots from your opponents and hit the ball where they’ll struggle to get it or try a surprise shot like a lob or an unexpected drive to throw them off their game."

      "title": "Use your partner to your advantage.",
      "content": "Use your partner to your advantage. When playing pickleball in teams, it is essential that you and your partner work well together. In addition to communicating throughout the game, move together and coordinate your attacks. If they hit the ball well, stay back and give them some space. If they struggle, try poaching a net shot to help them out. [9] X Research source Always pay attention to where your partner is so you don’t leave gaps for your opponent to hit the ball through."

      "title": "Use different angles, pace, and spin when taking your shots.",
      "content": "Use different angles, pace, and spin when taking your shots. To win a pickleball game, you need to be unpredictable. If you hit the same shot over and over, your opponent will catch on and block or return the shot easily. Try a bunch of different shots to keep your opponent guessing. Here are a few ways to mix up your game: [10] X Research source Change the height of your shots Use both hard and soft shots Alternate between a topspin and backspin Angle your shots, but remember the middle is safest Change up the pace of your serve Remember, it’s more important to keep the ball in play than to try fancy tricks or power shots. Practice new shots in your free time, but stick to what works when playing the game."

      "title": "Move with the ball and land on the balls of your feet.",
      "content": "Move with the ball and land on the balls of your feet. When you hit the ball, keep your feet parallel to create a solid center of balance. When you aren’t hitting the ball, keep your feet apart with one slightly in front of the other. This provides stability and balance for when you need to move quickly. Keep your feet moving and land on the balls of your feet rather than your heels. [11] X Research source Practice by yourself by hitting balls against a wall. Keep your feet moving while you do so to learn how to move with the direction of the ball. The balls of your feet are more flexible and aligned with your center of gravity, so landing on them instead of your heels allows you to move quickly in any direction. Don’t stand with your feet too far apart, as this will make it difficult to move properly."

      "title": "Be strategic and pay attention to where your opponents are.",
      "content": "Be strategic and pay attention to where your opponents are. Pickleball isn’t just a game of skill—it’s a game of strategy. If you strategize correctly, you can overcome a more advanced opponent. Choose your shots based on where your opponents are on the court and use their weaknesses to your advantage. Adapt your strategy when your opponents alter theirs. [12] X Research source For example, if your opponent is at the net, try hitting a soft drop instead of trying to drive through them. If you’ve forced them to the baseline, hit a drop shot in their kitchen. When playing against a banger (someone who only drives the ball), focus on blocking volleys and playing a soft game to get the advantage. Pay attention to whether your opponent is right- or left-handed. Avoid hitting to their stronger side."

      "title": "The third shot drop helps the serving team get to the kitchen line.",
      "content": "The third shot drop helps the serving team get to the kitchen line. The third shot is quite literal—it’s the third shot taken by the serving team. On this shot, players are encouraged to hit a drop shot, or a dink, into their opponents’ kitchen, giving the serving team time to reach the non-volley line. Here’s how to correctly execute the third shot drop: [13] X Research source The third shot drop follows the serve and the return. Get your paddle under the ball and lift with your knees. This propels the ball forward and upward so it will fall just over the net and into your opponents’ kitchen. Watch your angle and be careful not to hit the ball too deep, as this will set your opponents up for a smash. Pay attention to timing and hit the ball while it’s low. If you hit while it’s too high, you won’t get the arc or pace you need, which could allow your opponents to attack. Move to the kitchen line immediately after you hit the ball."

      "title": "Angle yourself toward the one hitting the ball instead of the net.",
      "content": "Angle yourself toward the one hitting the ball instead of the net. When you’re new to playing pickleball , you may turn your body straight toward the net rather than toward your opponent, especially if they’re diagonal to you. However, if you face the player who’s about to hit, you’ll have a better chance of hitting the ball. Track your opponents’ movements so you’re always ready to hit. [14] X Research source Do the same when you’re serving. Angle yourself toward your target."

      "title": "Think fast and always have a plan.",
      "content": "Think fast and always have a plan. While strategy is important to pickleball, it’s also fast-paced, so you need to be able to think on your feet and change up your plans at any moment. Pay attention to your opponents’ strengths and weaknesses and the current situation on the court. Stay in a ready position so you can move quickly and be ready for every ball. [15] X Research source Try to have the mindset that every ball is yours. This way, you’ll be ready for anything, even when your partner is the one currently hitting the shots. Be present and avoid daydreaming."

    {
      "title": "Talk to your partner before and throughout the game.",
      "content": "Talk to your partner before and throughout the game. Since pickleball is usually played in pairs, it’s essential for you and your teammate to be on the same page. Before the game, ask about their playing style and tell them about your own so you can strategize. During the game, shout things like “Mine!” when you’re going to hit the ball to avoid any mishaps. [16] X Research source For example, ask your partner if they prefer to start on the right or left, if they rush to the non-volley zone line (kitchen line), or if they have a strong backhand. Be sure to congratulate your partner when they score and encourage each other after every really to keep up the positivity."

      "title": "Adjust your shots and positioning to the direction of the wind.",
      "content": "Adjust your shots and positioning to the direction of the wind. Pickleballs are very light, so strong wind can easily affect your game when you’re playing outdoors. During warm-up, pay attention to the direction and strength of the wind so you can adjust your game play accordingly. Allow the wind to move you into position. [17] X Research source For example, if you feel the wind on your chest, move back. The ball will move toward you faster as it rides on the wind, so it will land deeper in the court or beyond the baseline. If you feel it on your back, move forward. Your opponent will be hitting into the wind, so the balls will drop shorter. If the wind blows across the court, keep your shots to the middle or to the side the wind is blowing from so the ball has room to move with the wind while staying in bounds."

      "title": "The continental grip gives you more control over the ball.",
      "content": "The continental grip gives you more control over the ball. The continental grip, or hammer grip, is a very common way to hold your pickleball paddle , and it’s typically the first grip taught to new players. Place the knuckle of your index finger to the right side of the flat bevel on the top of the handle. This forms a “V” between your thumb and index finger on top of the handle, which makes it easier to hit soft, angled shots. [18] X Research source For left handed players, place your knuckle to the left of the bevel instead. This grip is also called the hammer grip because you hold the paddle like you would hold a hammer to hit a nail."

      "title": "Take a deep breath if you feel yourself getting overwhelmed.",
      "content": "Take a deep breath if you feel yourself getting overwhelmed. Because pickleball is so fast-paced, it’s easy to get frustrated and overthink every little move you make. When you overthink, you’re more likely to make the wrong decisions and hit poor shots. Try to relax and trust your instincts. Remember your strategy and trust yourself to make the right moves. [19] X Research source Always fully commit to your shots. If you hesitate or change your mind mid-swing, you’re probably going to miss. Stay calm and be confident in your abilities. And remember, at the end of the day, it’s just a game. You’re supposed to have fun! Don’t worry if you mess up now and then. No one’s perfect!"

      "content": "Listen to helpful suggestions from other players. Criticism can be hard to hear, but don’t take it personally . If a more advanced player offers you advice or feedback, take it into consideration. Some strategies might not work for everyone, so keep practicing and see what works best for you. Always be kind and don’t get angry or upset if you don’t win right away. Everything takes practice! [20] X Research source If you need more advice, watch tutorial videos from pickleball players and coaches. You can learn a lot from watching pros, and you can practice their moves for your next game."
