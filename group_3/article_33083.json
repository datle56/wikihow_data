The object of Codenames is to identify all of your team’s secret agents without accidentally revealing enemy agents, innocent bystanders, or the deadly assassin. You need at least 4 players for a standard game of Codenames, and you can use the official deck of Codenames cards, or have all of the players access the Codenames app to set up a game.

      "content": "Try to create 2 teams of similar size and skill. Divide the players as evenly as you can into 2 teams that roughly match each other in size and skill. For instance, if you have 7 total players, divide them into teams of 4 and 3, and try to put players with a little more experience in the smaller group so it’s relatively balanced.

Seat both spymasters across from their teammates on the other side of the table or playing area.

You won’t need to use any of the remaining cards for that round, so go ahead and put them away. [4] X Research source If you’re using the Codenames app or playing online, they’ll automatically choose 25 codename cards for you."

If they’re red, then the red team goes first. Take 1 of the agent cards away from the opposing team, flip it over to the other team’s color, and add it to the starting team’s pile. [8] X Research source The double agent card balances out the advantage that the team who goes first has. The starting team will have 9 agents and the other team will have 8.

      "content": "Use only 1 word and a number to give your teammates a hint. The word gives a clue about which codenames correspond to a friendly agent and the number tells your team how many possible codename cards match the clue. The spymaster on the starting team goes first. Say only the 1-word clue and the number, and that is it. No other hints, facial expressions, or any other potential clues can be given. [10] X Research source For example, the spymaster could say, “Nature, 2.” Their teammates can then select the codenames they think match the clue to try to identify their agents, such as a codename card that says “Tree” and another that says, “Bear.” Don’t use any phrases like, “Okay so this is kind of related” or “Alright, this is kind of like” before you give your 1-word clue. Be careful which word you use! Sometimes a clue could potentially cause your own teammates to choose an enemy agent."

If you successfully guess the codename and identify an agent, you can then choose another codename. You’re allowed to guess as many times as the number that your spymaster gave you plus 1. If you guess incorrectly, you lose your turn. [11] X Research source For instance, if the spymaster says, “Water, 2” you could choose a codename card like “Boat” and “Fish.” If they’re both right, you have the chance to make 1 more guess. You could make a blind guess or try to use an older clue to choose another codename card. If you guess the opposing team’s codename, then they get to place an agent card on the codename. If you guess a bystander, then your turn is over and a bystander card is placed over the codename. If you guess the assassin card, then your team loses the game. Your team must make at least 1 guess, but you’re allowed to pass after your first guess if you like."

If it’s an opposing team’s agent or a bystander, then one of those cards are placed on top of the codename card. If they’ve chosen the assassin, then the assassin card is placed on to of the codename card and the game is over. [12] X Research source"
