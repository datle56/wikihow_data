In facing the death of a spouse or loved one, you may feel overwhelmed about what to do in caring for your spouse. If your spouse has been diagnosed with a terminal illness, and no further treatments are being done, talk with your doctor or healthcare providers about options through hospice and palliative care. Often the hospital's social work department is most helpful in this situation. Consider contacting hospice agencies directly about what they may offer. Hospice is a Medicare benefit that will generally pay 100% of medical expenses related to your spouse's primary diagnosis. Hospice benefits are often offered through private insurance too.

Create a peaceful atmosphere with soft lighting and soothing music. Reduce noise where possible. If appropriate, engage in prayer for your loved one in this time of need. Read a poem, book, or spiritual passage to your loved one. You might also gently massage their hands or feet, or simply hold hands."

See if your spouse has life insurance to help with bills in the short term. You may even be able to withdraw your spouse's life insurance policy earlier without penalty, when a terminal illness has been diagnosed. Life insurance policies may also have a cash value component, but this may be less than if used upon death.

Each person's experience with grief and loss is theirs alone, and cannot be determined by family or social pressures. Family and friends often want to help, but may not always know how. Be mindful that their hearts are often in the right place. Be open to accepting hope, love, and peace for the future. Family and friends may encourage you to \"move on\" before you are ready, so kindly ask them to support you and respect your time frame. They will often say these things out of their own discomfort because they don't know what to do when you are grieving. Remember that is about them, not you. Forgive yourself, and don't let regrets about what should have been, or what you could have done, stand in the way of remembering the good things that you and your spouse share. Your spouse will someday pass away, but you can still continue to honor their memories â€” past, present, and future. Remember that it is never too early to talk about the above-mentioned arrangements â€” even if all parties are healthy. Take action now to avoid having to deal with that stress while trying to grieve."
