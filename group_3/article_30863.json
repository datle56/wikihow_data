      "content": "Meditate. Meditation is a fantastic way to clear your mind and escape reality; it is traditionally used to make the mind calm and peaceful. [1] X Research source Proper meditation enables you to take your mind into a calm space and put reality on hold. [2] X Research source . The best part is that meditation can be done in the comfort of your own home (or even bed) and requires no prior training or monthly membership. Choose a peaceful environment, preferably one without distractions. The temperature should be comfortable, it should be as quiet as possible, and you should be able to be alone for 30 minutes. Find a comfortable position. Many people like to lay on the floor with their bodies relaxed, their feet pointed outwards, and their palms facing upwards. There is no “right” position in which to meditate, so find a position in which it is comfortable for you to lie still. You can also try the lotus position . Close your eyes. This allows you to tune out anything that is going on around you. If necessary cover your eyes with a mask or a towel. If you are in a noisy place, it may help to wear earplugs. Think of nothing. Relax completely, let your mind go free. Be aware of your breathing. Don’t necessarily try to control your breath, but simply breathe and be aware of it. [3] X Research source Expect good meditation to take practice. At first, it is almost inevitable that your mind will wander. However, with practice, you will be able to completely clear your mind during your period of meditation. When your mind does wander, bring your focus back to your breath. [4] X Research source Consider using downloadable meditation programs. Simply go to Google or YouTube and search for “meditation.” Even if you don't have time to meditate, take a few minutes to take a breath and reorient yourself before tackling your problems again.

      "content": "Listen to music. Listening to music is a fantastic way to clear your mind and make a mental escape from reality. Music has been scientifically shown to affect many different areas of the brain, and it can actually help you achieve self-awareness and regulate your mood. [6] X Research source [7] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source It is also a commonly used tool to engage in escapism. If you are unsure of what type or genre of music to listen to, you can try to listen to ambient music or binaural beats. For example, try Dr. Christopher Lloyd Clarke’s relaxation music or The Tranquil Harp: Improvisations for Relaxation, Meditation, Integration by Paul Baker. If you desire something different, try classical music, such as piano concertos, or listen to Gregorian chants. For something more lively, try listening to drum and bass music that has no lyrics."

      "content": "Practice yoga (or another calming physical activity). In addition to having physical benefits, yoga has mental and psychological benefits as well. It is an activity in which the participant focuses on breath and body instead of on the worries and stressors associated with reality. Yoga is a great way to have some personal time, clear your mind, temporarily escape your reality, and get a workout in as well. If you’ve never practiced yoga before, do a Google search to find a studio around you. Attend a class for beginners, and try to incorporate yoga into your routine. Many yoga studios will allow you to attend a trial class for free. Talk to the instructor of your first yoga class. He or she may be able to make some recommendations for types of yoga that will help you with your goal of mentally escaping reality. To make your own ‘yoga studio’ all you need is a yoga mat, water bottle, and a room that gives you space to lay out your mat. Pick up the necessary accessories from a local store, and [Do Yoga for Absolute Beginners|try yoga]] on your own in the comfort of your own home. Keep in mind that you may not feel the sensation of escaping reality the first time you try yoga. It will take consistent practice to make yoga an activity that helps with your mental state."

      "title": "Chant.",
      "content": "Chant. Chanting can be a powerful way to temporarily escape from reality. Performing chanting, or mantra meditation can allow you to mentally “remove” yourself from your mind, thereby mentally escaping reality. Chanting inspires a “relaxation” response. This means that your heart rate, brain waves, and respiration will become slower. [8] X Research source This physical response can actually make you feel like you are leaving reality behind. Chanting the mantra “Om” is said to be extremely calming to the mind, actually inciting the release of relaxing hormones. [9] X Research source This is because the “Om” sound sends vibrations through your lips and palate and into the back of your throat."

      "content": "Allow yourself to daydream. Daydreaming constitutes the ultimate mental escape from reality, but many of us don’t have the time to allow ourselves to drift into a daydream world. Daydreaming not only helps you mentally escape reality, but also plays an important role in allowing us to recognize our own potential, achieve a greater sense of identity and personal meaning, and enhance our self-control and creativity. [10] X Research source Allow yourself to daydream when the external environment is undemanding. [11] X Research source This can be while you’re running on a treadmill, sitting in a traffic jam, or ironing clothes. Let your mind truly wander. This means that you shouldn’t try to control your daydreams- there is no “right” or “wrong” daydream to have. Keep daydreaming. Studies show that we daydream less as we get older. However, this should not be so: daydreaming is the easiest way to mentally escape reality and requires nothing more than some time alone with your thoughts."

      "title": "Spend time alone.",
      "content": "Spend time alone. As your partner, colleagues, and children are potentially a part of your everyday life, escaping reality means leaving them behind temporarily and refocusing on yourself. Because the society that we live in is perceived by most to be hectic and filled with stressors, spending some dedicated time alone can help you to refresh your mind and be more ready to handle reality when you return. [12] X Research source Solitude allows your brain to “reboot.” [13] X Research source Turn off your phone and sign out of your social media. When you are no longer “connected” to everyone and everything, you will find yourself much more able to mentally escape reality. Wake up 30 minutes before anyone else and enjoy the peace and quiet of the morning. Use that time to reflect, meditate, and daydream. [14] X Research source Make alone time a priority. Many of us spend the majority of our day catering to others, whether colleagues, family, or friends. Make it a point to set aside a block of time each day to allow yourself some time to escape your otherwise hectic reality. [15] X Research source"

      "title": "Try a calming, repetitive activity.",
      "content": "Try a calming, repetitive activity. Instead of passively allowing your mind to wander, some people may find it helpful to actively engage in an activity that they can associate with a mental escape from reality. There are a wide range of activities that can facilitate an escape from reality. Try painting or knitting. The repetitive motion may help you find peace and solace and allow your mind to wander away from reality. If you’re looking to get exercise at the same time, go for a walk. Walking for 7,000-8,000 steps each day is great for your physical health and if you use your walking time to also meditate, daydream, or otherwise escape reality, you will be benefitting your mind as well as your body. If you want to enjoy the outdoors, try hiking, fishing, or gardening. Being in nature can be another avenue for your mental escape of reality. There is no “best” activity to help you mentally escape reality; however, you should always do something that you enjoy. Some people may find the best way to mentally escape reality is to go skydiving or snorkeling, while others may enjoy playing a computer game or putting together a puzzle. Reader Poll: We asked 2542 wikiHow readers what their go-to self-care activity is, and only 4% of them said Baking and cooking. [Take Poll] Baking or cooking isn't the first type of self-care that comes to mind for most people, possibly because cooking takes organization and work. But chopping vegetables or stirring batters and sauces can help you relax."

[16] X Research source Choose a book from your favorite author, a time-honored classic, or a best-seller. Find a book that takes you into a make-believe world. This could be a fictional world, such as that of Harry Potter or Lord of the Rings, or a book that takes place in another time or location, such as a work of historical fiction. Choose a series (something available in a trilogy or more) for an even longer escape from reality!"

Think about the good things in your life, and let go of the rest, even if only temporarily. Take a slow walk, look at the landscape, feel the breeze, hear the birds sing- do anything you don't normally take the time or have the patience to do!"
