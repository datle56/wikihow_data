      "content": "Shift down and hang the bike from a tree or work stand to work on it. Make sure that you shift down to the most outside gear before turning the bike upside down. If you have access to one, use a bike stand that holds the bicycle upright. If not, turn the bike upside down. Don’t turn the bike on its side since this will force you to work against gravity and make your job harder. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Disengage the brakes if they get in the way of removing the wheel. Different brake types have different brake release mechanisms, so refer to your instruction manual or the website of the bike or brake manufacturer. In many cases, you’ll simply have to unlatch a quick release located on either the brake calipers or the brake lever on the handlebars. Or, you may need to squeeze the brake calipers together in order to detach the brake cable from them. [2] X Research source You won’t need to disengage the brakes if they are disc brakes. If the bike has hydraulic disc brakes, do not squeeze the lever while the wheel is out."

      "title": "Loosen the nuts that attach the wheel axle to the bike.",
      "content": "Loosen the nuts that attach the wheel axle to the bike. You don’t need to remove the nuts completely, just loosen them enough that the wheel can (a few steps from now) be pulled free. If the nuts don’t want to budge when you use a wrench on them, apply a lubricant like silicone spray or even cooking spray. If you have a modern bike with quick-release wheel latches, taking the wheel off will be even easier — just open the latch and loosen the nut by turning it a few times so it can clear the frame. Don’t remove the wheel yet. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Pull the chain clear of the gear discs if you’re removing the rear wheel.",
      "content": "Pull the chain clear of the gear discs if you’re removing the rear wheel. With enough practice you won’t have to move the chain to do this, but you may need to at first. Shift gears so that the chain is on the outermost gear on the rear wheel and the innermost gear on the pedal spindle — this gives the chain more slack to work with. Pull back on the rear derailleur (the mechanism that guides the chain into place when shifting) so that the chain pulls clear of the cogs of the gear discs. [4] X Research source In a pinch, you can patch a punctured bike tube without removing the entire wheel — although it makes the actual patching job more difficult — but you have to remove the wheel to replace the tube.

      "content": "Pull the wheel clear of the bike frame. For the front wheel, you simply have to guide the wheel axle — now that the nuts or quick-release are loose — out of the fork that holds it to the bike frame. You do the same for the rear wheel, but you need to more carefully guide the wheel down and forward (if the bike is upright) past the chain and other obstructions. Keep pulling back on the rear derailleur to help move the chain out of the way. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Deflate the tire fully while it’s still on the removed wheel.",
      "content": "Deflate the tire fully while it’s still on the removed wheel. For a Schrader (American) style valve, use a small tool (like a thin Allen wrench) to depress the plunger inside the threaded cylinder. For a Presta valve, unscrew the top part of the stem to release the air. With a Dunlop valve, loosen the cap a few turns and then pull on the valve tip. [7] X Research source Schrader valves are the same type found on car tires. Presta valves are thinner and longer than Schraders, and have a locknut at the tip. Dunlop valves are thinner than Schraders and thicker than Prestas, and threaded only near the top. If your wheel has a lock ring that screws onto the valve stem to hold it to the bike rim, remove it after deflating the tube — but don’t lose it!"

Feed one lever between the outer tire and wheel rim, and pop out a section of tire — instead of sitting in a channel on the inside of the rim, it should now be off the rim in this spot. Leave this tire lever in place. [8] X Research source To reduce the risk of damage to your wheel frame, buy a set of inexpensive bike tire levers for the job — you can get them at any bike shop or online. A pair of spoon handles or flathead screwdrivers will work as levers, but you have to insert and pry with them carefully so you don’t scratch up or bend your wheel frame."

Adding too little will make it more likely to get pinched (and eventually punctured) by the outer tire when you reinstall it. [11] X Research source If you’re replacing the old tube due to a puncture, check the inside of the outer tire for sharp objects and holes larger than 0.25 in (0.64 cm), which will mean you need to replace the whole tire. Use a flashlight for a visual inspection, and/or run a thick cloth around the entire inside. Carefully remove anything you find. Do this before you move on to installing the new tube, or you may just end up with another flat tire!"
