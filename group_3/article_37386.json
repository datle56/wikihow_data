    {
      "title": "You don’t have to tolerate unwanted dick pics.",
      "content": "You don’t have to tolerate unwanted dick pics. Sending dick pics without the other person’s consent is a form of sexual harassment, and it’s perfectly acceptable to do whatever it takes to protect yourself from harassment. Block their number or profile, with or without a note letting them know you’re going to do it, and don’t look back. [1] X Research source Some senders of unsolicited dick pics might like getting blocked by you, since they’re just looking to provoke a reaction. You can also choose to mute them or hide their messages so that they don’t get a notification. If you’re getting dick pics over social media, you can also report the sender for harassment."
    },
    {
      "title": "Deny an unsolicited dick pic sender their ego boost.",
      "content": "Deny an unsolicited dick pic sender their ego boost. After all, if they’re sending you these pictures without your permission, why should you have to tip-toe around their feelings in your response? Let them know you’re not impressed by replying something like: “I’ve seen better.’ “2/10” “LOL” “This one’s not great.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "Sometimes harsher words are called for.",
      "content": "Sometimes harsher words are called for. If you’re really looking to bruise some egos, let them know that they’ve got an ugly looking member. People can be pretty sensitive about their dicks, so it’s a good opportunity to twist the knife a little as revenge for massively overstepping boundaries. “You should get a doctor to check that out.” [2] X Research source “What’s wrong with it?” “You sure that’s what it’s supposed to look like?” “That’s one ugly dick.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "If you don’t have a penis yourself, give the sender a surprise.",
      "content": "If you don’t have a penis yourself, give the sender a surprise. Grab a dick pic from the Internet (or your phone, if this isn’t the first time you’ve gotten one) and send it over without any context. Teach them a lesson that whatever game they’re playing isn’t going to work out for them. You can also get a little metaphorical. Instead of sending over a picture of a real penis, try a gif of a banana or sausage."
    },
    {
      "title": "The best response is sometimes no response.",
      "content": "The best response is sometimes no response. If you have read receipts, or are using Snapchat or another social media platform that lets the sender know when you’ve opened their message, leaving them on read is a great way to get a point across. [3] X Research source They’re looking for a reaction—don’t give them one."
    },
    {
      "title": "A weird emoji is a good way to confuse them.",
      "content": "A weird emoji is a good way to confuse them. Since getting an unsolicited dick pic is confusing, why not return the favor? You’ll have them trying to decipher your meaning, which gives you the upper hand in the interaction. Try one of these, or pick any other that catches your eye: [4] X Research source 😇: Are you too good for this interaction? Or too good for them? Let them figure it out! 👋: Is it a hello, or a goodbye? Who’s to say? Let them decide while you sit back. 💩: A classic emoji that makes absolutely no sense as a response to a dick pic. They’ll be puzzled over this one. You can also opt to send over a favorite meme—dig through your camera roll and see if you can find one that fits the situation."
    },
    {
      "title": "You have a right to confront them about their actions.",
      "content": "You have a right to confront them about their actions. No one should be sending dick pics without consent—in other words, without the person on the receiving end saying they want them. Asking them to justify their actions might stop them from doing this to other people in the future, and also can help you keep your relationship on the right track if you’re interested in this person. Message them something like: [5] X Research source “Why would you send me this?” [6] X Research source “I’m confused about why you would think this was a good idea.” “This isn’t appropriate for our relationship at all. Care to explain yourself?”"
    },
    {
      "title": "If you like what you see, let them know.",
      "content": "If you like what you see, let them know. If you’ve asked for dick pics and have had your request met, it’s good form to send them a compliment. People can feel self-conscious after sending such an intimate image of themselves, and they’re looking for affirmation. You can also say something like: “Looking good.” “That’s hot—I like it ;)” “10/10” “That’s a beautiful dick”"
    },
    {
      "title": "Emojis are simple and to the point in these situations.",
      "content": "Emojis are simple and to the point in these situations. If you don’t feel like turning this interaction into a whole conversation, but you still want to let the sender know that you appreciate the pic, try one of these: 😍 or ❤️: Let them know you like what you see with one of these. 😋: Try out this emoji for a naughtier response. 👰🏼: This one will let them know you’re really into it. Get ready for the altar!"
    },
    {
      "title": "One picture just might not be enough.",
      "content": "One picture just might not be enough. If you want to see more, just ask—whoever’s sending them to you will likely be more than happy to oblige. You can also make some requests if you know what you’re looking for. Try saying something like: “Got any other angles?” “Let’s see one with your shirt off too.” “Just one? You can do better than that ;)” “Find some better lighting. I want to see it in its full glory.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "You don’t have to respond to a nude with a nude, but you can.",
      "content": "You don’t have to respond to a nude with a nude, but you can. Although some people might pressure you into sending them nudes just because they sent you some, you don’t need to do anything you’re not comfortable with. But if you do want to send some sexy pics , this is another completely valid way to respond. Have fun with it! [7] X Research source Only send nudes if you feel comfortable with doing it and if you’re over the age of 18. Distributing child pornography is illegal, so for your own safety, don’t do this until you’re no longer a minor."
