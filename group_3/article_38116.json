      "content": "Always switch off the lights when you are not using them. Rooms that are lit with nobody in them are wasteful. In the era of solar, wind, and hydroelectric, nonrenewable options like fossil fuels are only used to offset demand for electricity. Since there are very few feasible ways for storing power for later use, electricity has to be generated, transmitted, and consumed all at the same time."

However, even when switched off and properly sealed, gas stoves still leak small amounts through the cooktop and pipes. While this amount is too small to start a fire, it does contribute to greenhouse emissions. [5] X Research source [6] X Research source Induction stoves are different from traditional electric stoves in the sense that the heating element is not located in the stove itself. In a traditional electric stove, the heating element switches on with varying amounts of power or switches on and off at various intervals to keep the pot warm. However, in an induction stove, the changing magnetic fields generated by the stove are used to induce eddy currents in the cookware, the result being that the cookware getting hot. They are considerably safer and greener than traditional gas and electric stoves."

While electric cars still have greenhouse emissions associated with their manufacture, some car manufacturers like Mercedes-Benz are offsetting the greenhouse gases caused by the production of electric cars. Electric cars are considerably greener than gasoline cars with similar range; just note it takes tens of thousands of miles driving before electric cars start becoming greener than gasoline cars. If you cannot find suitable electric or hybrid vehicles for your need, then switching to a compact sedan over an SUV may be another alternative. These use considerably less gasoline for the same range. If you're really serious about going all-out green, consider living without a car -- not only it's green, but could also save you a lot of money!"
