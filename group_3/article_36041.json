Then, switch to a cold compress and press it against your sinuses for 30 seconds. Continue to alternate the hot compress with the cold compress 2 more times. You can do the hot and cold therapy up to 6 times a day to soothe your sinuses. To make a hot compress, fill a clean sock with dry rice and seal the end shut. Microwave it for 1 minute or until it feels hot. To make a cold compress, wrap a bag of ice or frozen food in a kitchen towel."

      "title": "Breathe in steam for 10 to 15 minutes to open your nasal passages.",
      "content": "Breathe in steam for 10 to 15 minutes to open your nasal passages. Run a hot shower to create a steamy environment in your bathroom. Step into the shower and take deep breaths through your nose so the steam moisturizes your nasal passages. The steam can loosen mucus so your sinuses drain easier. This relieves pressure on the roots of your teeth. If you don't want to take a shower, bring a large pot of water to boil. Turn off the heat and drape a clean towel around your head. Then, carefully lower your head so it's 1 foot (30 cm) above the water and the towel traps the steam. Breathe in the steam for 10 minutes."

Repeat this with the other nostril. [6] X Research source If you use a neti pot, it's important to use distilled or boiled and cooled water to prevent infection.
