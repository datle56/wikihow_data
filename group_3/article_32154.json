      "title": "Check local laws in your area to make sure painting your helmet is legal.",
      "content": "Check local laws in your area to make sure painting your helmet is legal. In some jurisdictions, painting your motorcycle helmet may be a violation of road safety laws. This is because the petroleum-based solvents found in many paints may damage the helmet and reduce the protection it provides. Contact the transportation safety office in your local area for relevant information. [1] X Research source Laws regarding the modification of motorcycle helmets vary location to location and so do police officers’ interpretation of these laws. Wearing a helmet that doesn’t comply with local safety laws may result in a fine."

      "title": "Select a paint that is approved by the manufacturer of your helmet.",
      "content": "Select a paint that is approved by the manufacturer of your helmet. Because the solvents in some paints may weaken the plastic of some bicycle, motorcycle, and sports helmets, the manufacturer of your helmet may recommend against painting it. Check the tags and labels that came with your helmet when you purchased it, and look for any warnings about types of paint that should be avoided. [2] X Research source If you can’t find any helpful information in the material you received when you purchased your helmet, try contacting the helmet’s manufacturer, and ask if they have any recommendations about paints that would be safe to use on your helmet. [3] X Research source If the outside of your helmet is damaged, don’t paint it. The solvent in the paint may leak into outer shell and damage it."

      "title": "Avoid sanding the painted surface of your helmet.",
      "content": "Avoid sanding the painted surface of your helmet. If you try to sand existing paint off your helmet, you may inadvertently sand into the outer plastic or fiberglass shell. This can weaken the helmet’s outer shell, reducing its effectiveness in protecting the inner layer from everyday bumps and scrapes. This may diminish your helmet’s ability to protect your head in the event of an accident. If you’re going to buy a helmet to paint, go with a plain white or black matte helmet so that you don’t have to worry about removing any painted design or glossy finish."

      "title": "Clean your helmet with a mixture of dish detergent and water.",
      "content": "Clean your helmet with a mixture of dish detergent and water. Removing dirt and grease from your helmet is essential if you want the paint you apply to stick to its surface. Fill a small container with warm water and household dish soap, soak a rag in the mixture, and then thoroughly wipe down the outer surface of your helmet. [4] X Research source After washing your helmet, dry it off with a clean, lint-free cloth and let it sit for an hour so that it can dry thoroughly."

      "title": "Cover or remove any parts you don’t want to be painted or clear coated.",
      "content": "Cover or remove any parts you don’t want to be painted or clear coated. Remove any removable fittings that you don’t want to paint, such as a visor on a motorcycle helmet or a face mask on a football helmet. Simply pull off any pieces that are attached with hook-and-loop fastener or fasteners. Then use masking tape to cover any parts you shouldn’t remove, like the inner shell and vents. Make sure only the area you want to paint is exposed. [5] X Research source Use paper or plastic and masking tape to shield the inside of the helmet from the paint. Removing the inner shell, vents, or any other essential part of your helmet’s structure during the painting process may weaken it, so try to avoid doing this."

      "content": "Sketch your design on the helmet with a pencil. You can also use stencils, stickers, or tape to make your design. Take your time so that your helmet design will look just like what you imagined. [6] X Research source Use thin black lines to enhance the visibility of your design from a distance. To create complex geometric patterns, try cutting strips of masking tape and arranging them on your helmet. [7] X Research source"

      "title": "Paint your design with water-based acrylic paints and brushes.",
      "content": "Paint your design with water-based acrylic paints and brushes. These water-based paints are safe to use on helmets. Let each layer of paint dry before applying the next one so that every layer can properly bond to the surface of your helmet. This will help keep the paint from peeling off. [8] X Research source Apply your base layers first and then add shadowing, highlights, and any finishing touches. If you want to spray paint your helmet, opt to use an airbrush instead of an aerosol can. An airbrush will allow you to cover your helmet in a more even coat of paint. [9] X Research source Don’t paint over any safety stickers that may be on your helmet. [10] X Research source If you applied any masking tape to make your design, remove the tape slowly and gently only after the paint on your helmet has dried to avoid inadvertently damaging your design."

      "title": "Apply 3-4 layers of clear coat to protect the paint on your helmet.",
      "content": "Apply 3-4 layers of clear coat to protect the paint on your helmet. Shake the can of clear coat for 1 – 2 minutes before applying it to your helmet so that the solvent and clear coat become fully mixed together. Then position the nozzle a can’s length away from the helmet and spray. Move the can side to side and lightly coat the entire surface of the helmet. [11] X Research source Let the clear coat dry for 15-20 minutes, then repeat the process 2-3 times to ensure the helmet is evenly coated and the paint is protected. Use a clear coat that is intended for use on plastic. Check what your clear coat is made of before applying it to your helmet to make sure that it is safe to use on your helmet. Double check before spraying the clear coat that the inside of your helmet is completely covered. The clear coat may eat away at the foam inside the helmet. Allow the clear coat to sit overnight before reattaching any of the fittings you removed."
