      "content": "Remove distractions. Turn off or silence your phone and anything else that might make a noise. If there are other people around, tell them you plan to meditate and ask to be left alone for the next few minutes. If you have pets that may come looking for attention, put them in another room where they can’t distract you. Tell other people in the house “Please do not disturb me for the next 30 minutes unless it’s an emergency. I will be meditating and need to maintain absolute focus.”"

      "title": "Sit in a comfortable position.",
      "content": "Sit in a comfortable position. There are many different positions you can use for meditation. The key is to choose a position that is comfortable and won’t require you to consciously prop yourself up. [3] X Research source Some meditators purchase a zafu, a small floor pillow, or a zabuton, a small padded mat, to help prop them up. The most popular posture is the lotus position. Sit on the floor with your back straight. Place your left foot under your right thigh and right foot layered over the left ankle. If you are meditating for a long period of time, you may want to switch which foot goes under the thigh after a while. Some meditators sit in a chair. Make sure you keep your back straight and your feet flat on the ground."

      "title": "Time your breaths.",
      "content": "Time your breaths. The purpose of any meditative technique is to take your mind off potentially distracting thoughts that may pop up as you attempt to center yourself. Exhale and then slowly inhale until your lungs feel full. Count the seconds and then try to take the same amount of time to exhale. The length of time will depend on your lung capacity but you should generally try to breathe slowly. Continue breathing on this number of seconds to prevent other thoughts from entering your mind. [4] X Research source Try breathing in through your nose and out through your mouth. [5] X Research source For a slower, more relaxing meditation, try the 4-7-8 exercise. Exhale, then close your mouth and inhale for four seconds, hold your breath for 7 seven seconds, and exhale over the course of 8 seconds. [6] X Research source"

Try not to curve your breath too quickly. [7] X Research source It may help to add a 2 second waiting period between when your lungs are full and when they are empty to slow down your curve."

      "title": "Focus on your muscle reaction.",
      "content": "Focus on your muscle reaction. Focus your mind on how parts of your body react to your breathing. Feel your diaphragm, throat muscles, and shoulders shift as you inhale and exhale to occupy your mind. This should not be a painful strain but you should feel your muscles stretching in these areas. If may help to place your hand on your diaphragm so you can feel the muscle reaction. You can also focus on the relaxed parts of your body. Leave your hands and arms in a comfortable pose that doesn’t require you work any of their muscles and keep your mind focused there."
