Pull off the label with your fingers and give the bottle a good scrub to remove any glue residue. You can use any plastic bottle you have on hand. A water or soda bottle works great, but you could also use an empty hand sanitizer bottle, or whatever you have within easy reach. [1] X Research source"

Drill the other pair of holes 2–3 in (5.1–7.6 cm) up from the bottom of the bottle. Make sure each set of holes is parallel to each other. [2] X Research source If you're a kid, let an adult handle the drill so you don't hurt yourself. If you don't have a drill, use scissors or an ice pick."

      "content": "Spray paint the plastic bottle and 4 plastic bottle caps (if you want to). The plastic bottle will be the outside of the car (be sure to keep the original bottle cap on the bottle because you'll be using that soon). Then, grab an extra 4 bottle caps to make the wheels. Go with any paint color you'd like! A silver car with silver wheels would look cool. It’s easier to paint the bottle and bottle caps before assembling the car."

      "content": "Trim 2 plastic straws to be about 5 in (13 cm) long. Both straws need to be slightly longer than the width of your plastic bottle, so adjust the length accordingly to match whatever plastic bottle you're using.

Then, knot a piece of string or yarn and thread it through the hole in the lid, making sure the knot is on the inside of the lid. Screw the lid back on the plastic bottle. The string is optional, but it you want to use it, cut the piece to be 12–24 in (30–61 cm) long (you'll use the string to pull the car). Put the lid back on the bottle so the length of string hangs outside the lid in front of the car."
