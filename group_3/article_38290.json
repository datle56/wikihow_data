Common problems include not centering the code in the camera, too little light, or being too close or far from the code. Make sure the image is flattened and adjust the 3DS slowly until it scans in. If the code is meant for a specific game, you'll likely get a message or error message telling you so. [2] X Research source In this case, scan the code within the game instead."

If there is a logo around the code, or the code is otherwise labeled as \"for _______ only,\" this means you must have the appropriate game on to view the code. Any Mii game, for example, has a little \"mii\" in the center of the QR code's typical checkerboard pattern. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Find the in-game QR scanner. This is usually in the main menu or the settings page. However, some games hide these scanners to make the items you scan more valuable. Animal Crossing, for example, makes you talk to Sable once a day for 10 straight days to unlock the QR scanner. If you cannot find the QR code reader, look online or in the game's instruction manual."

Move it slightly if it doesn't read immediately. If you're scanning a QR code on a digital screen, it may take a bit of maneuvering to register due to the pixels."
