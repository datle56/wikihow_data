      "content": "Buy your paint. Use a high quality, oil-based paint. You can either spray, brush, or roll it on depending on what look you are trying to achieve. Buy the appropriate painting tools depending on which tool you want to use. Spraying the paint on will give it the smoothest look, rolling the paint on will add a little texture, and brushing the paint on will add a ton of texture."

      "title": "Get the right wax.",
      "content": "Get the right wax. You can find many high-quality waxes at a home improvement store that are specifically made for metalwork. Ask for that type of wax when you go to buy it. You will use the wax after the painting is finished for a final seal."

      "title": "Scruff up your stainless steel.",
      "content": "Scruff up your stainless steel. If your stainless steel is relatively new and hasn’t already had years of abuse, you may need to do some damage to it yourself. Stainless steel has such a smooth finish that the paint has a hard time sticking to it. [1] X Research source If your stainless steel has been scuffed up over years of use, the paint might stick. Otherwise you will need to use a sander to scuff up the paint. [2] X Expert Source Kevin Snow Commercial Painting Professional Expert Interview. 23 March 2022. You don’t need to destroy the stainless steel, just add some scuff marks to simulate normal usage. You can rent a sander from your local home improvement store. If you don’t want to rent a sander you can try doing manual abrasion. Grab a wire sponge and spend some time scraping at the stainless steel with the sponge. This may be able to simulate scuff marks too."

      "content": "Clean and prep your stainless steel. You need to rid the stainless steel of any grease, dirt, or other debris. [3] X Expert Source Kevin Snow Commercial Painting Professional Expert Interview. 23 March 2022. It’s a good idea to use a specialized steel cleaner or a degreaser, both of which can be found at a home improvement store. If you use a cleaner, note the drying time listed on the bottle. Wait that amount of time before continuing your project. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Buy primer.",
      "content": "Buy primer. Use any kind of primer that is rated for stainless steel. [5] X Expert Source Kevin Snow Commercial Painting Professional Expert Interview. 23 March 2022. Primer has a special bonding agent that allows it to hold to most substances, but you still need to get a high-quality stainless steel primer. This will give you the smoothest result. [6] X Research source White primer is recommended for most colors, but if you are painting your stainless steel a very dark color you might consider a darker primer."

    {
      "title": "Apply your primer.",
      "content": "Apply your primer. If you want a very smooth application, consider renting a spraying machine from a home improvement store. You can also use a paintbrush but you might leave ridges from the brush. Apply one coat of primer over the entire area you plan to paint. [7] X Research source If you are using a sprayer, hold the nozzle 12 to 18 inches (30.5 to 45.7 cm) away from the stainless steel. Try to use a wide mist. If you use a sprayer, make sure you paint in one direction. You may have ridges, but at least the grain of the paint will look consistent. [8] X Research source Let the primer dry before you start painting."

      "title": "Begin adding layers of paint.",
      "content": "Begin adding layers of paint. You’ve already completed the hard parts. Now all you need to do is add layers of paint to your stainless steel. Once your primer has dried you can start adding layers, but you should wait for each layer of paint to dry before you add a new one. Two or three layers should do the trick. Once again, you need to make the decision between a paintbrush and a sprayer. If you used the paintbrush to apply primer then you should use the paintbrush to apply the paint too. [9] X Research source If you like the ridges and texture that a paintbrush offers you can also consider using a rag to add additional textures."

      "content": "Wax the steel once it is completely dry. Apply a thin coat to the whole area that you painted and let the wax dry until it has a hazy look to it. Now take a clean dry cloth and buff the wax. This will add a final seal. [10] X Research source It's okay to use automotive wax."

      "content": "Visit a professional powder coater (look in the yellow pages). This is an electrostatic process where plastic/epoxy powder is deposited in a very thin layer all over the surface and then baked on. The advantages of powder coating are flexibility, a very wide range of colors and textures, and the ability of the powder to adhere to small voids and cracks on the surface without drips or runs."

Some are used hot, while others are applied cold, there are many to choose from and they also allow you to highlight your project while maintaining a natural finish. Often waxes are applied afterwards to provide a final seal."

      "title": "Varnish your metal.",
      "content": "Varnish your metal. Marine varnish is another way to put a final coat on your metalwork. Varnish has the advantage of being easy and forgiving to apply, however your work will have an obvious \"clear-coated\" look that is not always desirable. Varnish is very easy to touch up later and to redo as maintenance at a later date without changing the overall finish."
