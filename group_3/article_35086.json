Take the child and hold him or her facedown on your forearm. From there, use the heel of your other hand to thumb the child firmly on the middle back. With luck, the combination of gravity and pressure should dislodge the coin. If a child is choking, do not try this method. Instead, call 9-1-1 immediately."

Make sure to keep your child calm before and after an x-ray. If a child has never had a major medical problem, an x-ray may be frightening.

Avoid giving your toddler toys with small parts. Be especially careful about keeping batteries away from your child. These batteries are very dangerous to a child's digestive system and can cause serious problems if swallowed as the chemicals will cause the intestine to perforate. Magnets are also dangerous to swallow because they stick to each other and can cause necrosis of the intestines. They require surgical removal if swallowed."
