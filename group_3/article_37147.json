      "content": "Request the CFO's contact information. If the hospital billing department doesn't correct the billing error, request to contact the Chief Financial Officer. Explain your concern with the billing to the CFO, and ask them what they can do to rectify the situation. In some cases, the threat of contacting the CFO will be enough to make the billing department take your claim more seriously. If you're dealing with a small office or individual practice, there may not be a CFO. If this is the case, you can request the contact information of the head doctor."
