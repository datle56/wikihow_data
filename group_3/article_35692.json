The chiropractor might also manipulate the vertebrae of the neck in order to decrease the symptoms of tinnitus. Chiropractic adjustments are not painful, but they may cause some temporary discomfort.

You may hear ringing, buzzing, roaring, clicking or hissing sounds. [23] X Research source There are essentially two types of tinnitus: subjective and objective tinnitus. Subjective tinnitus is the most common form of tinnitus. It can be caused by structural ear problems (in the outer, middle and inner ear) or by problems with the auditory nerve pathways leading from the inner ear to the brain. In subjective tinnitus, you are the only person hearing the sound. Objective tinnitus is much rarer, but can be perceived by a physician during an examination. This can be caused by vascular problems, muscle contractions or conditions related to the inner ear bone."

Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is an approach that uses techniques such as cognitive restructuring and relaxation to change a person’s response to tinnitus. Tinnitus retraining therapy is a complementary practice that helps desensitize you to the noise in your ears. The therapist will teach you different ways to cope with the noise. This is a process in CBT known as habituation, where you can learn to ignore the tinnitus. The therapist will teach you about your tinnitus and will teach you a variety of relaxation techniques. This person will help you adopt a realistic, effective attitude in dealing with tinnitus.
