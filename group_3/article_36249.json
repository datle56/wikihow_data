Take your photo from an angle or above to avoid extra light entering the camera lens. Try to take photos in an area with diffused light. This could be outdoors on a partly cloudy day or in a photo studio with lightboxes. If possible, avoid taking photos in direct sunlight or with harsh, bright overhead lights. If your subject isn't wearing glasses, take a photo with your subject facing the sun. The sun will be behind you and won't cause any strong glare in the background of your image. However, make sure you aren't casting extra shadows on your subject if you do this. Turn off flash. Most times, you won't need to use the flash on your camera, as the built-in flash is almost never sufficient enough to illuminate a dark area and create a natural image. Flash can cause glare on glasses if it's left on."
