      "content": "Set the dye before washing black jeans for the first time. Fill a large bucket or a clean sink with cold water, then add 1 cup (236 mL) of distilled, white vinegar and 1 tablespoon (17 g) of salt. Soak the black jeans for about 15-30 minutes to lock in the dye before washing them for the first time (you only have to do this once, not before every wash). The acetic acid in the vinegar helps lock the dye into the denim fibers, making it less likely to seep out during a wash."

      "content": "Spot treat grease stains with household cleaners like Pine Sol . [1] X Research source Fortunately, most stains won’t show on black jeans because of the dark color of the denim. However, grease stains and other visible stains might show. Simply dab the stain with regular Pine Sol or Lestoil , then rinse the area with water and a few drops of detergent or dish soap. [2] X Research source This prevents the need to wash black jeans each time they get slightly dirty. Alternatively, hand wash the jeans as normal after dabbing with Pine Sol."

Then, fill a clean sink or bucket with cold water and add just a few drops of detergent for delicates or dark colored fabric and ½ cup (118 mL) of white vinegar. Agitate the jeans by hand for a few minutes, then let them soak for an hour. [4] X Research source Once they’re done soaking, press the excess water out of them with a clean towel and hang them up to dry, right side out. If you have to machine wash them, use the gentlest wash cycle possible and wash them with like colors in cool or cold water."

Instead, hang them right side out by a back belt loop to avoid wrinkles, or lay them on top of a clean towel on a flat surface to air dry. Make sure to keep them out of direct sunlight.

Make this a part of your routine each time you throw a pair of jeans in with the laundry, regardless of color. Turning the jeans inside out prevents the detergent from wearing as harshly on the dye, so they’ll maintain more of their color. [7] X Expert Source Rani Gorgis Laundry & Cleaning Specialist Expert Interview. 7 April 2021. Turning them inside out also prevents other clothes from rubbing against the outside of the denim, which can cause the color to fade and the fabric to wear out."

      "content": "Use color-preserving detergent (especially for dark jeans), or vinegar. If you notice your jeans seem to fade a bit with each wash, use a color protectant detergent like Woolite Dark Defense or Clorox for Colors . These detergents are available at most supermarkets or department stores. Alternatively, opt to use vinegar in place of detergent—just add ½ cup (118 mL) of white vinegar to the machine with no detergent and wash as normal. [8] X Research source Detergent is meant to eliminate stains but often does not differentiate between stains and dye. Vinegar is milder and will clean your jeans without removing the dye. [9] X Expert Source Rani Gorgis Laundry & Cleaning Specialist Expert Interview. 7 April 2021. Vinegar has a strong smell. However, it will eventually fade once the jeans are dried in fresh air (vinegar is a natural deodorizer, after all)."

      "content": "Wash jeans with other garments instead of by themselves. Wait until you have a lot of dark clothes that need washing before washing your jeans. Jeans tend to fade less when washed with other dark clothing. Dark dyes can fade in the wash and swirl around with other clothes, but if clothing is packed in together, less dye will fade out. Wash dark jeans with other dark clothing if you can. That way, if the dye does bleed a bit, it won’t stain or damage lighter colored jeans or clothes. Wash your jeans in medium loads of laundry to avoid overloading the washer (they may not get as clean, and the extra weight of wet denim could wear out your machine over time)."

[10] X Expert Source Rani Gorgis Laundry & Cleaning Specialist Expert Interview. 7 April 2021. Set your washer to the slowest spin cycle possible and the lowest temperature water. If there's an option for a gentle wash or a hand wash on your washing machine, use that. If you're up to it, wash your jeans by hand, especially if they’re coated or embellished. This is more gentle on them than machine washing, even though it’s more labor-intensive."

In fact, washing jeans too often can cause them to fade prematurely. If you notice any stains between washes, spot clean with household cleaners rather than throwing the jeans in the wash. [11] X Expert Source Rani Gorgis Laundry & Cleaning Specialist Expert Interview. 7 April 2021. To spot clean most light stains, lightly wipe away any moisture as soon as possible, then dab the spot from inside the jeans with a clean cloth doused in warm, soapy water. [12] X Research source"

Choose a spot away from windows, exterior doors, or other sources of direct sunlight, since sunlight can cause them to fade more quickly. [13] X Expert Source Rani Gorgis Laundry & Cleaning Specialist Expert Interview. 7 April 2021. To prevent wrinkling, hang jeans up by one of the back belt loops. Sunlight is great for drying and brightening white fabrics, so white jeans are OK to dry outdoors if you prefer. Keep all other colors of denim away from sunlight, though."

Instead, fill a spray bottle with vodka (the cheap stuff works—no need to waste good liquor!) or a half water-half vodka mix. Lightly mist the jeans without soaking them and wait for them to air dry. Once dry, the smell should be gone. [16] X Research source Some people suggest putting your jeans in the freezer overnight to kill odor-causing bacteria without washing. This might work temporarily, but isn’t a long-term solution (it can’t hurt to try, though!). [17] X Research source"
