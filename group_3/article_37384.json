    {
      "title": "Outline the issues raised in the complaint.",
      "content": "Outline the issues raised in the complaint. If you're looking at a written complaint, take a moment to note the specific issues the person has raised. It may also help to prioritize those issues. This will help you organize your written response and ensure you don't overlook something the person mentioned. If you don't have a written record, confirm the specific issues with the person directly. [1] X Research source For example, if you're speaking directly to the person making the complaint, you might say \"I hear you saying\" or \"I understand that\" followed by a restatement of their issue in your words. If they clarify, make another restatement until you can be sure that you're both on the same page. If the person has mentioned what they want, or how they want the issue resolved, determine whether you are able to give them what they want or would need to get someone else involved. For example, if the person is asking for a refund after a drink they ordered at your café made them sick, you might have the authority to take care of it on your own."

    {
      "title": "Evaluate the validity of the complaint.",
      "content": "Evaluate the validity of the complaint. Investigate the person's complaint as thoroughly as possible using the resources you have available. Depending on the nature of the complaint, you may also want to dig deeper to determine if anything else could be involved."
    },
    {
      "title": "",
      "content": "For example, if a customer in your café complained that a drink they ordered made them sick, and that drink was made with milk, you might check to make sure your milk hadn't gone bad. If the person is complaining about customer service, you might pull security camera footage of their transaction and examine the situation. Email or phone records might also help if the person communicated with anyone in those ways regarding the issue."
    },
    {
      "title": "Identify potential legal issues.",
      "content": "Identify potential legal issues. Some complaints may threaten legal action if the problem isn't resolved to the person's satisfaction. Those threats may be legitimate or they may be just bluster. However, if you see any potential legal problems, such as alleged violations of laws or regulations, you may want to talk to an attorney before you respond directly to the person's complaint — even if the person hasn't threatened legal action. For example, if a disabled customer complains that the aisles of your store are not accessible, that might be something you could fix. However, it's also something they could potentially sue you over. An attorney could help you respond to the complaint without putting yourself at greater legal risk."
    },
    {
      "title": "Discuss the matter with anyone directly involved.",
      "content": "Discuss the matter with anyone directly involved. If the person mentions anyone by name, meet with them and get their side of the story. Avoid taking sides. Take what everyone says at face value and try to get to the bottom of the situation. [2] X Research source You may have resources that can clear the situation up. For example, if a customer at your café complained that one of your employees was rude and threw a drink at them, you could potentially review security camera footage or talk to other employees who were working that day to find out what happened. If you interview more than one employee, talk to them separately in private. Avoid making a big deal about it and assure them that they're not in any trouble, that you're just trying to get to the bottom of the situation."
    },
    {
      "title": "Document the investigation if necessary.",
      "content": "Document the investigation if necessary. If the complaint alleges that you violated a law or regulation, you can use documentation of your investigation and the steps you took to address the complaint as evidence in any future legal proceeding. Even if there's no threat of legal action, thorough documentation can help you write a response to the complaint. Create a log of everything you do to address the complaint. Include the date and time that any action was taken along with specific details about the action taken and the people involved."
    },
    {
      "title": "Use a standard business letter format if possible.",
      "content": "Use a standard business letter format if possible. Provided you have the address of the person who complained, respond with a formal business letter . Even if you only have an email address, you can still use a modified business letter format. This format sends a message to the person that their complaint is being taken seriously. Most word processing apps have a template you can use for business letter format. If your organization has official letterhead, it's generally better to use that. Then the person will know the response is an official communication from your organization."

    {
      "title": "Introduce yourself and thank the person for their complaint.",
      "content": "Introduce yourself and thank the person for their complaint. Open your letter by telling the person who you are and your position in the organization. Thank them sincerely for bringing the matter to your attention and ensure them that you always welcome feedback. [3] X Research source If you have any particular responsibility for the subject of their complaint, you might include information about that as well. For example, you might write: \"I am Carla Christiansen, and I am the assistant manager in charge of quality control here at Cupcake Café.\" Include detail about the complaint and a summary of their issue. For example, you might write: \"I appreciate receiving your letter dated November 14, 2019, in which you told me about the drink you purchased here that made you sick. I appreciate that you brought this matter to my attention. Here at Cupcake Café, we pride ourselves on crafting the highest quality beverages for our customers.\""

    {
      "title": "Apologize and express empathy as appropriate.",
      "content": "Apologize and express empathy as appropriate. If there's something in their complaint that you can apologize for sincerely, it will likely make them feel better for you to do so. Take personal responsibility and let them know that if you were in their place, you would feel the same way. [4] X Expert Source Tami Claytor Etiquette Coach Expert Interview. 29 September 2020. For example, you might write: \"I'm so sorry for the trouble this issue has caused you. I know if this had happened to me, I would probably do the same thing you did. I appreciate you bringing this matter to my attention so I can make things right.\""

      "title": "Detail what you've done to address the complaint.",
      "content": "Detail what you've done to address the complaint. In the next paragraphs of your letter, let the person know what actions you've taken personally to deal with the issue they raised as well as any changes that have been made as a result. If you're offering the person anything specifically, let them know this at the end. [5] X Research source [6] X Expert Source Tami Claytor Etiquette Coach Expert Interview. 29 September 2020. For example, you might write: \"I checked all the products used in making your drink and confirmed that they were all of the highest quality and none had expired. However, I have enclosed a check for the purchase price of your drink along with a gift card in the hopes you'll give Cupcake Café another chance.\" Write active sentences in the first person. If anyone else was involved in handling the complaint, list them by name and explain their role and how they assisted. For example, you might write: \"I instructed Caroline Carter, the head barista at Cupcake Café, to double-check all the expiration dates on the dairy products and make sure the fridges were operating optimally.\""

      "title": "Offer an opportunity for further feedback or assistance.",
      "content": "Offer an opportunity for further feedback or assistance. Close your letter with a final paragraph letting the person know when and how they can reach you if they want to speak about the issue further. If you plan to follow up, you might also let them know when and how you intend to do that. [7] X Research source For example, you might write: \"I hope this resolves the issue to your satisfaction. If you have any other comments or questions, feel free to write me at the above address or call (111) 222-3333. I'm in my office every weekday between 10:00 a.m. and 2:00 p.m. I'll touch base in a week to make sure you've received this letter. Thanks again for reaching out to me.\""

      "content": "Attach any related documents. If there are any reports, receipts, photos, or other evidence related to your handling of the complaint that you want to share, make copies to include along with your letter. These documents provide proof that you did what you said you did and have made every effort to make the situation right for the person. [8] X Research source If you offered the person who complained a refund, gift card, or any other compensation, include that also along with your letter. Don't make them return to your organization to pick it up."

      "title": "Have someone else read your letter before sending it.",
      "content": "Have someone else read your letter before sending it. A co-worker or friend can not only spot any errors you might have overlooked in your letter, but they can also ensure that you've written your letter in the right tone. You want to make sure that you're sending the message that you want to send to the person who complained. If the complaint raises potential legal issues, you may also want to have a lawyer read it over to make sure you're not making any admissions that could come back to haunt you if the person decides to file a lawsuit."

      "content": "Mail your response to the person in a timely manner. You should try to get the response to the person as soon as possible after they submit their complaint. [9] X Expert Source Tami Claytor Etiquette Coach Expert Interview. 29 September 2020. While some complaints may take longer to investigate than others, generally, you should have a response out to them within a couple of weeks at the longest. [10] X Research source If the complaint is more complex and your investigation is taking longer, you may want to drop a briefer note and let them know that you're investigating the matter and will be in touch with them once the investigation has concluded."

    {
      "title": "Recall or remove dangerous products if necessary.",
      "content": "Recall or remove dangerous products if necessary. If the complaint was about a faulty or defective product, make sure there aren't any more that could cause the same problem. If you're a manufacturer, sometimes the only solution is to recall all products released before the complaint was made, just to be sure no one else has the same issue. For example, if someone complained of food poisoning after drinking a beverage made in your café, you might want to pour out the products used to make that drink in case they were contaminated. You would probably also want to put a sign up in your café alerting other customers to the issue."
    },
    {
      "title": "Follow up directly with the person who complained.",
      "content": "Follow up directly with the person who complained. Don't let your formal response be your last word to the person who complained. Even if you didn't mention it in your letter, plan on reaching out to them within a week or two after you send them the letter to find out how they're doing or if they have any other comments or complaints. [11] X Research source If you have the person's phone number, a phone call to follow up is typically all that is necessary, and the person will likely appreciate it. Simply tell them who you are and say that you're just calling to follow up and find out if they have any other comments or feedback to offer. If you don't have their phone number, a quick email or another brief letter is also fine. When you follow up, don't fish for compliments or imply that you believe you've made everything okay. That might not be the case. It's also possible that the person might find it awkward to hear from you again. Just be polite and thank them for their time."

      "title": "Implement new policies that respond to the feedback.",
      "content": "Implement new policies that respond to the feedback. If you've gotten one complaint, you can assume that other people experienced something similar and simply didn't speak up. Identify what originally went wrong and change your way of handling things, if necessary, so the problem won't happen again. [12] X Research source For example, suppose a customer complained that they got sick after consuming a drink they bought from your café. An investigation determined that some of your milk was expired. You might institute a new policy requiring every barista to check the milk dates at the beginning of their shift and rotate the milk in the fridge so that the cartons with the soonest expiration dates get used first."

      "title": "Train or retrain employees on how to respond to the issue raised.",
      "content": "Train or retrain employees on how to respond to the issue raised. For customer service issues or complaints about employees, you may need to host a refresher workshop for your employees. Emphasize that no one is in trouble but that you want to ensure the situation doesn't happen again. For example, if a customer complained that one of your employees made a racist comment to them, you might host a seminar for your employees on valuing diversity or hold racial sensitivity training."
