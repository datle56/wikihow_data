      "content": "Place your candles in a summoning formation. There are many different patterns that ghosts respond to, and you should feel free to follow your instincts while setting up your candles. However, for best results, you should place your candles: One in each of the cardinal directions at the edge of the magic circle: north, south, east, and west. This symbolizes the ends of the earth from which you are calling the spirits. The fifth candle should be placed in front of the person who summons the ghost, to boost his connection with the spirit world."

      "content": "Light your candles and sit in summoning position. If you are the summoner, you should sit as close to the center of the magic circle as possible, and you should have a clear, unblocked view of the candles surrounding you. If friends are joining you in your summoning, they should sit inside the magic circle and between the candles. Blocking the view between the summoner and the candles can weaken his connection with the spirit world and cause the summoning to fail. Always exercise caution when around an open flame. If you or one of your friends knocks a candle over and starts a fire, you spirit channeling game could turn into big trouble."

After you have shuffled and bridged the deck nine times, cut the deck five times. While doing this, keep your mind clear, and be sure there are no interruptions. In numerology, the number \"9\" represents patience, meditation, and the rewarding of tests. [3] X Research source By shuffling until you bridge nine times, you invoke the nature of this number. In numerology, the number \"5\" represents harmony, balance, and consciousness. [4] X Research source By cutting the deck five times, you establish a harmonious union with consciousnesses outside of your magic circle."

Have each person touch the palm of their right hand to the deck of cards, but do not let go of the deck at any point. If the summoner loses contact with the deck, his connection with the spirit world could be weakened. Each person touching the deck with their right hands symbolizes the right handed path of magic, sometimes called white magic. [5] X Research source Evans, Dave (2007).
