      "content": "Consider which Monopoly game you want to play. Just as there are a number of special editions of the Monopoly board game, there are a number of online versions of Monopoly. Here are some of the available versions: Monopoly Classic is the classic Monopoly game in which players start with $1500 cash, earn $200 for passing Go, and play for properties such as Boardwalk, Park Place, and others which are named for locations in Atlantic City, New Jersey, USA. Monopoly Here and Now uses dollar amounts more appropriate to the modern world and replaces the classic tokens with playing pieces more associated with the early 21st century. Monopoly Here and Now: World Edition uses modern world dollar amounts, but substitutes locations from around the world for those found in the classic game. Monopoly Hotels is a derivative game that focuses on building hotels, with amenities such as guest rooms (to attract famous toy guests), special attractions, and offsite entertainments such as museums, zoos, and aquariums. Monopoly: Millionaires plays much like the classic Monopoly game, except that each player has his or her own game board. Players can also build skyscrapers as well as the traditional houses and hotels. Monopoly City Streets is a joint venture with Google in which Google Maps is used to create the game board. Players can buy their home streets as well as locations around the world, and can not only erect houses and hotels, but also skyscrapers and football stadiums, and can also dump trash on other players' properties. There are also several online Monopoly games you can play for money as well as for fun. As some of these are on casino websites, they likely require a \"buy-in\" to play, and you could lose your money if you lose the game."
