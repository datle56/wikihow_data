In 2021, Olivia invited fans to call her Sour Heartbreak Hotline (323-622-7687) during a commercial break for Saturday Night Live . Fans were able to get a “free taste,” or snippets, of the 11 songs from her upcoming album Sour .

In June 2023, the hotline previewed the first 15 seconds of her new song “Vampire.” When you call the number today, Olivia answers with a short message to visit spillurguts.com.

      "content": "Be sincere and include a return envelope to get a response. Briefly introduce yourself and explain how Olivia has impacted you. Whether she helped you overcome a breakup or inspired you to start singing, get specific about what you love about her. Finish off with a polite request to return your letter, send an autograph , or answer one of your burning questions. [4] X Research source When writing fan mail , use conversational language to showcase your personality. To make your letter stand out (and increase the likelihood of it being read), put it in a brightly-colored envelope or decorate the outside with stamps, stickers, and gems. You could use the album artwork of her debut album, Sour , for inspiration. Be specific to make your letter more meaningful. For example, instead of saying “You're so talented,” you could say, “I admire how vulnerable you are when it comes to songwriting. I listened to “good 4 u” when I was going through a breakup, and it helped me get back on my feet.” If you’re requesting an autograph, send your photo in a properly stamped and self-addressed envelope. It typically takes 3+ months for a response, so try your best to be patient. [5] X Research source In the meantime, you can send fan mail to Billie Eilish , Kelly Clarkson , or another celebrity you admire!"
