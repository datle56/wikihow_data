      "content": "Collect dead insects that you find. If you found a dead insect at home, in your yard, or anywhere outside that you’d like to preserve, just pick it up and place it in a container. While insects that have died in the past few days work the best, it’s possible to pin older insects that have dried out after you rehydrate them . Entomologist Samuel Ramsey, Ph.D states “as [insects] die, their soft tissue begins to decompose, and it is a lot more difficult to move regions of the body.” Avoid insects that are really small, like aphids, or have soft bodies, like caterpillars or silverfish, because they can shrivel up and lose their original shape after you pin them. [1] X Research source Be careful handling dead insects that have stingers because you can still injure yourself. Use a pair of tweezers or wear thick gloves to transport them. To keep butterfly and moth wings safe, fold a piece of paper into a triangle and place the insect inside."

      "title": "Kill live insects in a jar using a tissue soaked with ethyl acetate.",
      "content": "Kill live insects in a jar using a tissue soaked with ethyl acetate . Place a few tissues at the bottom of a large jar, and pour in enough ethyl acetate (nail polish remover) to dampen the tissues. Seal the lid to trap the fumes. After you catch an insect , place it in the jar and close the lid so it’s airtight. Wait until the insect stops moving, which usually takes a couple of minutes for small insects or up to 30 minutes for larger ones. [2] X Research source Separate large and small insects into separate jars so none of them get eaten. Alternatively, collect bugs in a plastic bag or resealable container, and place them in your freezer for a couple of hours to kill the insects. [3] X Research source Look for insects to pin in your yard, near outdoor lights, under rocks, or on plant leaves. If you’re trying to catch a fast or flying insect, use a net to capture them."

      "title": "Store insects in your freezer until you’re ready to pin them.",
      "content": "Store insects in your freezer until you’re ready to pin them. If you don’t plan on pinning the insects immediately, keep them in an airtight container in your freezer to stop them from drying out. [4] X Research source Biologist Shweta Sharma says that insects can be kept for a longer period of time in the freezer than if you left them at room temperature. Insects will start to dry out and become stiff the longer you leave them in the freezer, but you can rehydrate frozen insects easily to soften them again."

      "title": "Let freshly frozen insects thaw for 10-20 minutes.",
      "content": "Let freshly frozen insects thaw for 10-20 minutes. If you’ve only had your insects in the freezer for a day or so, then take them out and let them sit at room temperature. Test moving the legs with a toothpick to see if they feel loose. If they’re still stiff, let the insects thaw for a few more minutes. [5] X Research source If your insect still isn’t pliable or flexible, avoid forcing it to move because you could damage it."

      "title": "Make a relaxing chamber with damp paper towels.",
      "content": "Make a relaxing chamber with damp paper towels. A relaxing chamber creates a moist, humid space that helps soften the insects again so you’re able to pin them. Take a few sheets of paper towels and dampen them with water. Wring out the excess water, and place them in the bottom of a resealable container or jar. [6] X Research source Too much moisture can cause mold to form on the insects, so be sure to dump out any excess water. To help prevent mold, you may also soak the paper towels in a 50/50 solution of water and rubbing alcohol."

      "content": "Place the insects in a plastic dish inside the relaxing chamber. Use a small plastic lid or a Petri dish on top of the damp paper towels. Leave the dried or frozen insects in the dish. Then, seal the container so it’s airtight. [7] X Research source If you’re relaxing multiple insects, stack them between layers of paper towels"

      "title": "Seal the container for 2-3 days until the legs easily move.",
      "content": "Seal the container for 2-3 days until the legs easily move. Place the container somewhere it won’t be disturbed to let the insects relax and rehydrate. After a few days, use a toothpick or pin and try moving the legs and antennae. If they easily move, then the insects are ready to pin. [8] X Research source Larger beetles and hard insects may take 5-6 days to relax. If the legs are still stiff, don’t try to force them to move. Place the insect back into the container and wait another day or so before you check them again."

      "title": "Place your insect on a foam board or pinning block.",
      "content": "Place your insect on a foam board or pinning block . A pinning block has multiple steps for pinning insects and labels at different heights, but styrofoam is a cheap alternative. Lay the insect flat on the foam where you want to pin it. Ramsay says “the foam allows you to easily remove the insect… by pulling on the pin so you can look at it from different angles.”"

      "title": "Push an entomological pin through the insect’s thorax.",
      "content": "Push an entomological pin through the insect’s thorax. Only use pins that are made for displaying insects because others could rust or damage the bugs. Leave about 1 ⁄ 2 inch (1.3 cm) of space between the top of the pin and the insect. Where you place the pin depends on the type of insect you’re working with: [9] X Research source Bees, wasps, and flies: Place the pin through the thorax (middle section) between the front wings and slightly right of the center True bugs (cicadas and shield bugs): Put the pin through the scutellum, or the triangular area between the wings Grasshoppers and crickets: Place the pin through the saddle-shaped prothorax to the right of the center Beetles: Pin through the front of the right wing cover just off center Other insects: Put the pin through the thorax just right of the center If you have an insect that’s too small to pin, cut out a small triangular piece of an index card. Stick it on the pin about 1 ⁄ 2 inch (1.3 cm) below the head. Put a tiny dot of glue on the outermost corner of the triangle, and carefully attach the bug to it."

When you’re happy with the placement, cross 2 pins in an X-shape over each section of the leg and antenna. [10] X Research source Try positioning the foot of each leg first before pinning the rest of the leg in place. If you want a professional-looking display, try to make the legs symmetrical on each side."

      "content": "Pin the insect through the thorax and onto a spreading board . When you’re working with butterflies, moths, dragonflies, or any other insect with larger wings, stick the entomological pin straight through the middle of its thorax. Pin the insect into the groove of your spreading board. [12] X Research source A spreading board has a groove running through the middle where the insect’s body fits so the wings can be spread flat on the sides. Leave about 1 ⁄ 2 inch (1.3 cm) of space between the insect and the top of the pin. That way, you can handle the pin without touching or damaging the bug."

      "content": "Cut 1 ⁄ 4 in × 8 in (0.64 cm × 20.32 cm) strips of paper. To avoid pinning the wings directly and damaging them, strips of paper help hold the wings in place. Use wax, tracing, or plain white printer paper. Take a pair of scissors and cut off 2 strips so you have one for each wing. [13] X Research source Make sure the paper isn’t sticky, or it could damage the wings. Avoid using newspaper or colored paper, which could potentially stain the wings."

Gently guide one of the wings down until it’s even with the spreading board. [14] X Research source Ramsay says to make sure the insect is fresh or relaxed. He says, “ if you try to move [an old butterfly’s] wings, you're going to break the wing off of the butterfly's body.” If the wing won’t move or open, try relaxing the insect again."
