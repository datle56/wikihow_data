Don’t worry about duplicates or confusing categories—you can always cut these later when you make your final lists. Each list must have 12 categories on it, but the lists don’t have to have a theme.

[4] X Research source If you’re doing a DIY game, hand out lined paper with the numbers one through 12 written down the left side. Typically, you play three rounds of the game before crowning a winner, so you’ll need three sheets of paper per player. Alternatively, use one sheet of paper that players can number and write on three times."

Roll a die if you’re playing the actual board game, or use an online random letter picker to generate a letter. This is known as the key letter. [5] X Research source In the Scattergories board game, the die only has 20 letters. It excludes the letters Q, U, V, X, Y, and Z because there aren’t many common words that start with these letters. Put these letters in play for a challenging twist on the game."

Once the countdown starts, everyone scans their list and thinks of a word to write that fits each category and starts with the chosen letter. For example, if the letter is “A” and the first category is food, you might write “apple.” If the second category is “Celebrities,” you might write “Amy Adams,” and so on. [6] X Research source Acceptable answers must begin with the key letter, not “A,” “An,” or “The.” You can’t use the same answer twice in one round. It’s unlikely you’ll use it twice in one game since you roll a new key letter every round. Proper names count whether you use the first or last name, or both if the name is alliterative. Alliterative answers are worth one point for every word that starts with the letter. For example, “Amy Adams” would be worth two points in the celebrity category if the key letter is “A.”"
