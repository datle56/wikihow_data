      "content": "Neutralise the aluminium. Make a water solution of calcium carbonate or baking soda. You can then spray or rub it on the surface using a spray gun or cloth. [2] X Research source This is especially important for surfaces which have previously been cleaned with an acid cleaner. This may react with the clear coating and cause black streaks."

      "content": "Coat the aluminium. Spray the solution in short bursts along the length of the object you want to protect. Keep spraying until the surface appears glossy and wet. [10] X Research source Don’t bring naked flames anywhere near the area you are spraying in. Make sure to not apply too much solution as this may run and dry in streaks."

      "content": "Hang two lead cathodes over the short edges of the inner tank. You can use pieces of lead flashing as cathodes (objects through which a negative current runs). The cathodes need to have a surface area at least twice the size of the aluminium objects that you want to anodise. [15] X Research source Lead flashing is commonly used to protect roofs and you can buy it online or at a hardware store. Hang the lead cathodes over the edges of the tank using anodising jigs (hooks for the edges of the tank). These can be bought at a hardware store or online or you can make them out of titanium wire."

      "content": "Prepare an electrolyte solution. Electrolyte is the liquid which will sit in the anodising tank and which will cover the object being protected. The amount you need depends on the size of your tank and the size of the object you want to protect. Use a solution of car battery acid diluted with water in a 1-1 ratio. Place the water in the inner plastic tank and slowly pour the acid into the water. [18] X Research source The electrolyte may heat up when the acid and water mix, so you should leave the electrolyte to cool for at least 18 hours."
