      "content": "The word dates back to the mid 1500’s. It comes from the Latin “ negāre ,” meaning to deny or refuse. In the Medieval period, “ renegāre meant to renounce a belief, but by the late 1700s, it had evolved to mean changing your mind or going back on a promise. [3] X Research source Some people mistakenly believe that “renege” is a slang abbreviation of the word “renegotiate,” but this isn’t the correct origin of the term—although the two do actually have similar meanings."

      "title": "The correct spelling of the word is “renege.”",
      "content": "The correct spelling of the word is “renege.” It is commonly misspelled, and many people write it as “reneg” without the final “e.” This is likely because the word ends with a hard “g” sound, rather than the “j” sound that “ge” typically makes. “Renege” is pronounced “ruh - neg” or “rih - neg.” [4] X Research source"

[6] X Research source “The night before her wedding, she got major cold feet. She actually decided to call the whole thing off because she wasn’t sure they were right for each other.” “They were about to make an offer on the house, but they got cold feet.
