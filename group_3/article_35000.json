Nowadays, having a gluten-free diet doesn't have to be inconvenient. Many restaurants easily accommodate those that need to eat gluten-free and gluten is also labeled on many products in grocery stores."

      "content": "Talk to your doctor about getting erythropoietin injections. Erythropoietin is a hormone manufactured by the kidneys to promote the development of red blood cells by the bone marrow. Once the kidney cells sense that the oxygen level in the blood is too low it produces and releases erythropoietin to stimulate the bone marrow to generate more red blood cells. The increase in red blood cell count can also enhance the capacity of blood to carry oxygen. [15] X Trustworthy Source FamilyDoctor.org Family-focused medical advice site run by the American Academy of Family Doctors Go to source In general, erythropoietin functions mainly to encourage the production of red blood cells and instigate the synthesis of hemoglobin (a component of the red blood cells that are in charge in transporting oxygen) . Erythropoietin is administered either through the veins or via subcutaneous (external, fatty portion of the legs and thighs) injection."

[16] X Research source Prior to transfusion, safety precautions are taken to ensure the quality and compatibility of blood. It is tested for signs of contamination which can cause adverse reactions to patients. Donated blood can contain infectious components for HIV/AIDS and hepatitis so proper screening is very important. After a thorough examination, the blood transfusion is given. It is administered through a central venous catheter or intravenous line in the arm over several hours. The patient is then watched carefully for any untoward signs of blood transfusion such as difficulty of breathing, itchiness or rashes and an increase in body temperature."
