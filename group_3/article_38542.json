      "title": "You can't see unsent messages on iOS 16 or newer.",
      "content": "You can't see unsent messages on iOS 16 or newer. However, you may be able to see old messages if you have an old iPhone or iPad running iOS 15 or older. This can also work for Macs running macOS 12 (Monterey) or older. Since it's very unlikely to have an older iOS device, you can try adjusting your notification settings to make sure you don't miss any notifications before they're unsent. To see Messages on other devices, you must have iCloud and iCloud Keychain enabled on both devices. Just open the Messages app on the old device to see unsent messages. Similar to unsent messages on iMessage, you cannot retrieve deleted messages from Facebook Messenger , but you can adjust your notification settings."
