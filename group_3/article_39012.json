There will be a knob that labeled \"gain.\" Turning down the gain means that the amplifier is not amplifying the signal coming in from the stereo head (the part mounted to your dash)."

      "content": "Turn the stereo up to 2/3 the max volume. This is the best range to use when setting gain because you avoid overworking the stereo head. If you overwork the stereo head you could end up sending distorted sounds to your amplifier. Digital displays make it easy to tell when you are at 2/3 volume, but if you do not have one you can turn the volume all the way up (counting the number of turns) and then turn it back 1/3 of the way. For example, if you turn the volume knob 3 times to get to max volume, you would turn it back down 1 full turn to get to 2/3 volume."

Turn it up (clockwise) until the sound (music, talking, test tone, etc.) is as loud as you might ever want to listen to it, so long as you do not hear any sound distortion or overload your speakers. If you do hear a distortion, turn the gain back down until the distortion is gone. Some amplifiers will have a knob that can be turned by hand, but others may require the use of a screwdriver to adjust the gain."

To see the math behind this you can look at an electrical engineering formula wheel . If you do not want to do the math, you can use an online converter to plug in the wattage of your amplifier and the resistance of your speakers to get your target output voltage.

      "title": "Recognize that the way you wire your speakers affects resistance.",
      "content": "Recognize that the way you wire your speakers affects resistance. This can dramatically change the voltage reading you get and is worth knowing. Speakers wired in series are all connected in a chain and increase the resistance of your system. This decreases the amount of power received by each speaker. Each speaker added will also raise the resistance of the system. The formula for finding total resistance for speakers wired in series is Z1 + Z2 + Z3 …. = Ztotal. Where Z is the resistance of a given speaker. For example, if you have three speakers with resistance values of 4 Ohms, 6 Ohms, and 8 Ohms your total resistance wired in series would be 18 Ohms (4+6+8=18). Speakers wired in parallel are all connected to the amp directly. This decreases the resistance of your system. This means more power will go to each speaker because adding speakers to the circuit will lower the resistance of the system. Do not decrease resistance too much or you will damage your amp. The formula for finding total resistance of speakers wired in parallel is a little trickier. It is (Z1 x Z2 x Z3… ) / (Z1 + Z2 + Z3…) =Ztotal. So say you have two speakers with resistances of 6 Ohms and 8 Ohms. This time it would look like this: 1) Multiply the values. 6 x 8 = 48 Ohms 2) Add the values. 6 + 8 = 14 Ohms 3) Divide the top by the bottom to find your total resistance. 48/14 = 3.43 Ohms (rounded)"
