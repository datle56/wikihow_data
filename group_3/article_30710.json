[1] X Research source While the individual measurements associated with the suit are also important to get the right fit, your height and weight can help you estimate your fit. This is especially important if you're going to have your suit tailored, because height and weight helps tailors determine your “drop” of the suit, which is the difference between the size of the pants and jacket."

      "content": "Measure shoulder-to-shoulder to get your over-arm measurement. The over-arm measurement will help to find the width of the entire jacket, from shoulder-to-shoulder. Start your tape measure at the joint of one shoulder. Then, run it across the top of your shoulders, behind your neck, and to the joint of your other shoulder. [3] X Research source When determining measurements, don't pull the tape measure tight. Instead, make sure it fits snugly around your body."

      "content": "Raise your arms and measure around the widest part of your chest. This measurement is essential to get the right body-fit and a flattering cut for your jacket. To take it, raise both arms and run the tape measure around the fullest part of your chest, underneath both your arms. Go all the way around your body. Then, lower your arms to secure the tape measure and record the measurement. [4] X Research source Your nipples are typically where the widest part of your chest is. Don't flex your chest muscles while taking this measurement, as this could make your suit fit too big."

To get it, place the end of the tape measure in your armpit, then pull it down to your wrist and record the measurement."

Position your tape measure at the lowest point of your crotch, then bring it up to the spot where you typically wear your belt. Make note of the measurement. Choosing the best rise for you will help your body look proportional. [13] X Research source Pants that are labeled as “normal rise” will have a rise between 9 to 12 in (23 to 30 cm). They’re a great option if you’re of average height. “Short rise” pants typically have a rise between 7 to 9 in (18 to 23 cm). This rise can look very flattering if you’re shorter than average height. “High rise” pants have a rise that’s over 10 in (25 cm), and they’re a great option if you’re taller than 6 ft (1.8 m) tall."
