      "content": "Open your umbrella and flip it over. To create a new umbrella, you’ll need to separate the umbrella mechanism from the canopy. Open the umbrella and place the top of the canopy on the floor so that you can easily access the fabric inside of the umbrella. [1] X Research source The metal parts that stretch out are called the ribs."

      "content": "Cut the fabric loops attaching the canopy to the umbrella. Use a pair of scissors to cut the fabric loops connecting the canopy to the ribs. Once you're done removing the connecting fabric, separate the canopy from the ribs. [3] X Research source You won't be able to use your old canopy after you cut the loops."

      "title": "Measure the old canopy so you know how much fabric to buy.",
      "content": "Measure the old canopy so you know how much fabric to buy. Use a tape measure and get the approximate length and width of your old canopy. Add 2–3 inches (5.1–7.6 cm) to your measurements for potential mistakes and seam allowance. Write down the measurements on a piece of paper and save it for later. Set the old canopy aside for later."

      "title": "Purchase new fabric for your new umbrella canopy.",
      "content": "Purchase new fabric for your new umbrella canopy. You can purchase the proper fabric online or at a fabric store. Fabric like 2.2-ounce nylon taffetas and 2.5-ounce Supplex with UV protection will protect you from rain and the sun’s rays. Some fabrics will just absorb rainwater, making them a poor material choice for an umbrella."

      "title": "Trace new triangles",
      "content": "Trace new triangles on your new fabric. Lay the triangle you cut out over your new fabric and use chalk to trace an outline for your new canopy triangles. Then, use a ruler or tape measure to draw parallel lines that are 3 ⁄ 8 inch (0.95 cm) from the lines that you originally drew to make up for the seam allowance. Trace the same amount of triangles that were in your old canopy."

      "content": "Cut the triangles the from the new fabric. Use fabric scissors, shears, or a rotary cutter to cut through the fabric along the lines that you traced. Cut out all of the triangles, making sure to keep the edges as straight as possible. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Sew",
      "content": "Sew the triangles with a 3 ⁄ 8 inch (0.95 cm) seam allowance. Use a sewing machine to straight stitch all of the triangle pieces together using a small stitch length. Sew the triangles together in pairs at first, then sew the triangles together in groups of 4. The final step is to sew the groups of 4 together to form your canopy. Use a polyester or weather-resistant thread so that umbrella doesn't fall apart when you use it. The 3 ⁄ 8 inch (0.95 cm) of fabric that overlaps should be on the underside of the umbrella."

Sew thread into the canopy and loop it around the rib several times. Continue to attach each rib to the new canopy until all of them have been securely attached. [8] X Research source Use 8-10 threads in each area to securely attach the new canopy."

To make sure that the new canopy is securely attached, open and close the umbrella several times. If the new canopy detaches from the umbrella mechanism, flip the umbrella over and sew more threads around the ribs."
