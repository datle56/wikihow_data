Meet your dog’s gaze now and then to show them you love them—just remember that hard stares can be perceived as threatening, so don’t stare at your dog too long or too often.

      "content": "Praise your dog when they do something right. A great way to bond with your dog is to praise good behavior. This not only teaches your dog what they’re doing well, but it makes them happy because you’re happy. Verbally praise them, give them some ear scratches or belly rubs, and give them a treat. [3] X Research source Amphlett recommends using clicker training : “The way the clicker works is every time you click, you give the dog a treat. So it’s a very effective tool in teaching the dog when they’ve done something good, and you can mark the precise moment they have performed the thing that you’ve asked them to do.\""

      "content": "Feed them healthy food at the same time each day. A great way to show your dog you love them is to let them know they can rely on you. Feed them a nutritious dog food, following the best care instructions for their size and breed so you don’t over- or underfeed them. Dogs do well with routine, so try to feed your pup at the same time each day. [5] X Trustworthy Source Best Friends Animal Society Nonprofit animal welfare organization dedicated to saving animal lives by operating and supporting no-kill animal shelters Go to source If you want to keep your dog stimulated while eating, Amphlett says, “Instead of feeding from a food bowl, I feed my dog his entire meals out of dog toys. If he wants to eat, he has to basically work for his food. This is great for keeping dogs mentally stimulated, and it slows down their eating. It gives them that feel-good factor when they’re foraging for food and are successful in locating it.”"

      "content": "Understand their body language. To create a strong bond with your dog, it’s important to let them know you respect them and their boundaries. Pay attention to their body language. If it seems like they want you to back off, give them some space. Don’t ignore warning signs like growling or moving away from you. This lets your dog know you can be trusted. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Never use physical punishment.",
      "content": "Never use physical punishment. If you physically punish your dog for bad behavior, they may become frightened, which can sometimes lead to aggressive behavior and distrust. Never hit your dog if they do something wrong, and instead be clear and consistent about which behaviors you want and don’t want. Use a firm voice to clearly tell your dog “no” when they do something you don’t want, and address the behavior as quickly as possible so your dog understands why you’re disciplining them. [7] X Trustworthy Source American Kennel Club The American Kennel Club (AKC) is a purebred dog pedigree registry in the United States. The AKC advocates for the responsible ownership of dogs and promotes purebred dog events, such as the Westminster Dog Show. Go to source Another way to discipline your dog without yelling or hitting is to put them in “time out” for minor issues. Have a designated time out area, and try to redirect your dog’s focus to something other than the bad behavior. It’s also important to focus on positive reinforcement when your dog does something right. Try to use the same responses each time to avoid confusing your dog."

      "content": "Pet your dog frequently. Most dogs love physical affection, so be sure to give them lots of belly rubs , pats, and head scratches. If your dog is constantly lying on or near you or wiggles their body when they see you, they probably want to be pet. [8] X Research source All dogs are different, though, and some may not enjoy physical affection. Remember to pay attention to their body language. If they move away from you or seem uncomfortable, it’s best to stop whatever you’re doing. It’s especially important to rub your dog’s ears. Dogs have a lot of feeling receptors in their ears, so gently scratching or playing with them can make your dog feel happy and comfortable. Pay attention to your dog’s body language so you don’t pet them too much. This can make them feel overstimulated and stressed."

Taking them on walks also allows you to spend quality time together. Aim to walk your dog every day, and try to make sure the walks occur around the same time each day, as dogs thrive on routine. [9] X Research source Other exercises are also a great way to bond with your dog. Try taking them swimming or doing agility training. Exercise outdoors when you can, as all the new sights and smells help stimulate your dog’s brain."

      "title": "Play with them so they’re mentally engaged.",
      "content": "Play with them so they’re mentally engaged. Every dog plays differently, so try a bunch of different games and interactions, like tug-of-war or fetch, to determine what they enjoy. Playing with your dog gives them the attention they desire, some exercise, and brain stimulation. It prevents them from feeling bored and even depressed. [10] X Trustworthy Source Best Friends Animal Society Nonprofit animal welfare organization dedicated to saving animal lives by operating and supporting no-kill animal shelters Go to source The way you play with your dog will also vary depending on their age. Puppies, for instance, may be more energetic while senior dogs may be more laid-back. Amphlett warns, “Lots of dog toys I wouldn’t leave out because puppies will chew them and destroy them and could potentially choke on the pieces. But I think most dog toys will tell you whether you should leave them out on the box.”"

Just make sure all the dogs know and like each other beforehand—inviting an unsocialized dog could lead to trouble. Make sure the dogs have access to all their favorite toys and treats.

Create a space that’s just for your dog, whether it’s a room, a corner, or a fenced-in area in your yard. This should be a comfortable space they can go to relax when they’re feeling stressed or anxious. Include food and water, a bed, and some of their favorite toys. [15] X Research source Amphlett says she likes puppy playpens, “Because dogs, if they’re bored, frustrated, or anxious, can do things like chew the walls or chew your cables. So if you’ve got a playpen set up surround the perimeter of the room, there is basically nothing for the dog to destroy. Within the playpen, you want to have lots of things for the dog to chew on.”"

Studies have shown that when dogs and their owners interact, both the person and the dog release oxytocin, a hormone associated with love and happiness. Oxytocin is released whenever you look at your dog, pet them , or play with them. [17] X Research source Oxytocin is the same hormone released when parents look at their baby. One study also found that a dog’s heart rate tends to go up after hearing the words “I love you.” So while your dog may not be able to say it back verbally, they likely understand what you mean!"
