Sit so the members of the other team are to your left and right and your teammate is across from you. [2] X Research source You could also deal out cards to determine teams. Shuffle the deck and give each player 1 card. The players with the highest-value cards form one team and the players with the lowest values form the second team."

This card determines the potential trump suit , which means the suit of the card would be stronger than any other suit for the current round.

If a player wants to accept the trump, they take the card and add it to their hand. Otherwise, they say “pass” and the next player to their right gets to accept or pass. [7] X Research source If you’re holding the jack or 9 of the trump suit, accept the trump since those cards are the strongest cards in the suit. Accepting the trump card means you think your team will earn more points than the other team at the end of the round."

Take all of the cards played during the trick and put them in a face-down pile in front of you. [14] X Research source Example: Trump is hearts. The lead card was a queen of spades. Players followed with a king of spades, ace of spades, and 9 of spades. Whoever played the ace of spades wins the trick since it’s the highest value in the lead suit. Example: Trump is spades.

If a team wins all 8 tricks, add 90 points to the total. When a team wins the last trick of the round, add 10 points to the total.
