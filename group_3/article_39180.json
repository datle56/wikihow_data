When spooning, one person (the “big spoon”) holds the other person (the “little spoon”) from behind as they both lie down. Spooning is a great type of hug to incorporate into sexual foreplay, but it's also a cozy way to fall asleep or just relax with your partner. Spooning is common among couples, but know that you and your partner aren’t limited to being either the big spoon or little spoon—feel free to mix it up sometimes!"

      "title": "Discuss the subject with your partner.",
      "content": "Discuss the subject with your partner. Communicate your expectations with your partner before incorporating sexual hugging into your relationship to make sure you’re both on the same page. Whether you’re hugging your partner or someone else, consent is always necessary. It’s important you know what your and your partner’s expectations and boundaries are before implementing sexual hugging. For instance, they may enjoy spooning but find bear hugs claustrophobic, or perhaps they’re uncomfortable with unexpected physical contact and will need you to ask permission before initiating a hug. You might say, “Hey Abdullah? I was thinking, if you’re comfortable with it, maybe we could try incorporating more sexual hugging into our relationship. How would you feel about that?”"

      "title": "Establish a safe and comfortable environment.",
      "content": "Establish a safe and comfortable environment. Any type of hugging , but especially sexual hugging, is best done in a place and context in which you and your partner are both comfortable and feel safe. Often, this may be in your own home—especially the bedroom, if you intend for the sexual hugging to lead to sex. Consider how the environment contributes (or not) to the activity of sexual hugging: would pillows and blankets make things more comfy? Maybe candles or music would set a romantic mood. Be sure nobody is going to come over unexpectedly or call you. Consider turning off your phones for uninterrupted cuddling or sexual activity."
