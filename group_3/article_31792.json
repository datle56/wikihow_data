      "content": "Understand CB technology. For many in today’s world of communication, CB radio seems like an outdated method of contact. CB radio still has many benefits depending on how you use the device. For desolate environments, like mountains or deserts, CB radio can be the most effective device to contact people. [1] X Research source The radio signal is short wave, so you can only contact those in a 40 to 100 mile radius, depending on the device/antenna you have. You should probably have a contact you are planning to communicate with using the CB radio. Another use for CB radio is for safety contacts. If you are going on a long road trip through desolate areas, CB radio can be a vital tool to connect with the police."

      "content": "Select and mount an antenna. You can get large antennas for a wider range in service, but will require more time to install. There are small profile antennas that are only 2 feet, like the Walcott, which can even be used on motorcycles. The best place to mount your antenna is on the center of your roof. Depending on what antenna you have, you might have to drill holes into your vehicle. Check the installation requirements of the antenna before purchasing it. If you want an easier installation process, you can invest in a magnetic antenna. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Issue a radio check. Listen to the channel for a few moments. If there are people talking, politely wait for a break. When you're sure it's clear, ask for a radio check. Wait for a response. If no one responds, re-issue a radio check, but wait patiently before doing so. When another operator responds, interpret their response. Many operators are truck drivers who aren't looking for conversation. Others are enthusiasts that can not wait to chat. Follow the tone of the other person/people. Be polite. Nobody wants to communicate with a rude operator. Also be sure not to take up too much air time while on a crowded station."
