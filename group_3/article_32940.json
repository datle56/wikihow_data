Artemisia Nursery says, “Sunflowers do best when they're grown directly in the soil.” Sunflower roots are sensitive to being moved, so transplanting them may kill them. They grow best at temperatures between 64 and 91ºF (18–33ºC). Only plant at slightly lower temperatures once the last frost has passed.

If the growing season is shorter than this in your area, plant the sunflowers two weeks before the last frost.

If you are trying to grow extra-tall sunflowers or growing them as a crop, dilute the fertilizer in water and pour it into a \"moat\" around the plant, well away from the base or at least 8 inches (20 cm). A balanced or nitrogen-rich fertilizer are the best options. [10] X Research source Another option is a one-time application of slow-release fertilizer worked into the soil."

Place a plate or tin pie pan under the container to catch run-off water. Most dwarf and medium-sized sunflower varieties require pots that are 12 to 16 in (30 to 41 cm) wide, while Mammoth sunflowers need at least a 5-gallon (19 l) container .

Plant them at the same depth they are in the pot, spaced 18-24 inches (46-61 cm) apart. Water daily until the plants are established. [19] X Research source If you start seeds indoors about 4-6 weeks before the last frost date in your area, they’re safe to move outside once the seeds are fully sprouted. Move the seedlings outside 1 week before planting them in the ground. Increase the amount of time they spend outside for 3-4 days.

Cover the ground with netting to make this more difficult without blocking sprouts. Place snail bait or snail repellent in a circle to form a barrier around your planting area. [23] X Research source If deer are in your area, encircle the plants with chicken wire once they start growing leaves. Use a 36-inch (91 cm) piece of chicken wire to surround the leaves. Get a few 6-foot (1.8 m) bamboo poles or wooden stakes to raise the chicken wire as the sunflowers grow. This protects them from deer. Watch for small, gray sunflower moths and use an insecticide as soon as you see moths when your flowers are blooming.

      "content": "Select a sunflower variety that fits your space. There are many sunflower varieties and hybrids, but most gardeners only look at a couple of characteristics, like height or color, usually listed on the seed packet or online listing. Sunflower height ranges from dwarf varieties under 1 foot (30 cm) to giant sunflowers 15 ft (4.6 m) or taller. If you're going to grow the sunflower in a container for its whole life, choose a dwarf variety or other smaller variety if possible, recommends Artemisia Nursery. Also, decide whether you want a traditional yellow sunflower or a more unusual color. Different sunflower varieties produce one stalk and flower or branch out into multiple stalks with several smaller blooms. A few popular varieties of sunflowers are: Mammoth: This large variety grows from 7-12 feet (2-3.5 m) tall with 12-inch (30.5 cm) flower heads that feature bright yellow petals. [26] X Research source Moulin Rouge: This sunflower has burgundy petals with an ebony center and grows up to 6 feet (1.8 m) tall.

[28] X Research source Lemon Queen: This variety features lemon-yellow petals around a deep-brown base. They grow up to 6 feet (1.8 m) wide with many stalks and 8 feet (2.5 m) tall.

Toward the end of this period, the green back of the flower head begins to turn brown. This is the best time to harvest the seeds . To gather seeds for roasting or for next year's planting, cover the flowers with paper bags to protect them from birds. Cut off the flowers once they’re fully dry. [30] X Research source Lay the flowers on a flat surface and rub your hand over the seeded area. Then, use your fingers or a fork to pull the seeds off the flower. Store seeds for planting in an airtight container in a cool, dry place until you are ready to plant. If left alone, the flowers will drop seeds for next year's crop. However, harvesting them yourself guarantees protection from pests."
