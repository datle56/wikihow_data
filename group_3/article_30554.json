Ask a friend or family member to help you take the measurement to make sure you get the right number, so you can buy a beret that you’ll love! [1] X Research source You can also get your head measured at a hat shop or a department store, if you don’t have anyone who can help you."

      "content": "Place a tailor’s measuring tape on your forehead 1 in (2.5 cm) above your brow. A tailor’s measuring tape is a flexible measuring tape that is used for taking all kinds of fashion measurements. Get your helper to start wrapping it around your head by placing the end on your forehead about where a hat would rest, which is usually about 1 in (2.5 cm) above your eyebrows. [2] X Research source Make it easier for your helper by sitting down to get measured, unless they are much taller than you."

      "content": "Wrap the measuring tape around your head 1 ⁄ 8 in (0.32 cm) above your ears. Have your helper wrap the tailor’s tape measure all the way around your head, so that it is parallel to the floor. Make sure it is about 1 ⁄ 8 in (0.32 cm) above your ear on each side, which is where a beret would typically rest when it’s on your head. [3] X Research source If the measuring tape feels really tight around your head, ask your helper to loosen it up a bit. The goal is for the measuring tape to feel snug, but not constrictive, just like you want your beret to fit."

      "content": "Read the measuring tape to find out the circumference of your head. Read the number on the tape where it meets the starting end on your forehead. Use this number when you’re shopping for berets to find one that fits you properly. [4] X Research source To get your US fitted hat size, you can divide your head’s circumference by 3.14. For example, if your head is 22 3 ⁄ 4 in (58 cm) around, your US fitted hat size is 7 1/4."

      "content": "Choose a small beret if your head circumference is 21–22 in (53–56 cm). This the approximate range that most small-sized berets fall in. Double-check a brand’s sizing chart, if they have one, to make sure that this is true for berets made by a particular manufacturer. [5] X Research source If you’re shopping for berets made by a US manufacturer, the sizes will probably be listed as US fitted hat sizes. Look at a beret brand’s website to find a sizing chart if you’re shopping for a beret online or ask for a sizing chart if you’re shopping in person. Some brands might have extra-small berets that are slightly smaller than this range."

Make sure to check the manufacturer’s sizing chart, if they have one, to be sure. [6] X Research source Some beret’s might be one-size-fits-most, in which case there won’t be sizes to compare your head size with. You might be able to find a size range for the beret on the manufacturer’s website. Higher end berets usually come in different sizes, so you can find the perfect fit."

Remember to read a brand’s sizing chart to make sure, if they have one available. [7] X Research source Some brands might also offer extra-large berets that are slightly bigger than this range."

Go for the next size up if you can’t find a beret that is exactly your size. [8] X Research source For example, if your head size is 23 in (58 cm) and a size S beret is 22 1 ⁄ 2 in (57 cm), while a size M beret is 23 1 ⁄ 2 in (60 cm), choose the size M beret."

      "content": "Select a beret with a plateau of 9–10 in (23–25 cm) if you have a slim face. The plateau is the outer diameter of the beret, similar to the brim on a hat. A beret with a smaller outer diameter will look better on you if you have a narrow face. It’ll look more fitted on your head and not big and floppy. [9] X Research source The outer diameter of a beret is sometimes measured in “col,” which is the diameter of the plateau in inches. In this case, a beret with a col of 9 or 10 could be good for you if you have a narrower face."

A beret with too small of a plateau will look out of place on your head, even if it is well-fitted around your head. [10] X Research source If the beret you are considering buying has a plateau measured in col, get one with a col of 10 or 11, if you have a rounder face."
