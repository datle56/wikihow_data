      "content": "Pull the old sole off with pliers. Even if the sole is starting to come loose, you will probably need pliers to pull it off the shoe entirely. Hold the shoe firmly and pull on the edge of the sole with pliers, moving the sole away from the bottom of the shoe. If the sole doesn’t come off easily, try wedging a paint scraper or butterknife between the sole and the shoe as you pull on the sole with pliers. [1] X Research source You can also use a heat gun or hair dryer to warm up the glue that attaches the sole, which will make it easier to remove."

Pour a little acetone or nail polish remover on a rag and scrub the bottom of your shoe with it. The glue should dissolve and scrub off. Clean any dirt or residual grime off the shoe as well.

      "content": "Apply shoe sole adhesive to the new sole with a brush or cotton ball. Follow the instructions on the adhesive for application. Some adhesives must sit for a few minutes, or “cure,” before the item can be put in place. Some adhesives require heat to be activated Shoe Goo is a common and effective shoe sole adhesive, and is available in many shoe shops, sports supply outlets, and department stores."

      "content": "Put the new sole in place and press it tightly against the shoe. If the adhesive needs to cure before it’s used, wait for as long as the instructions indicate before putting the sole on. Start at the front and lay the sole gradually on the shoe, making sure the edges line up properly. Once it’s in place, apply pressure to stick it firmly on the bottom of the shoe."

Secure the sole in place by wrapping rubber bands or duct tape around the shoe, or by placing it on the ground and setting weights on top of it to press the shoe into the sole. [4] X Research source It can be helpful to stuff the shoe with paper first so that it keeps its shape while being clamped."

Make the layer fairly thick, as it’s better to put in too much and have it overflow than to not have enough.
