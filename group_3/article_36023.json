      "content": "Let it out. If you're experiencing extreme gas pain, trying to hold the gas inside your body for the sake of social decorum is only going to make the pain worse. Remember that the average person passes gas 10 times per day, and there's nothing abnormal about needing to do so, even if the timing seems inconvenient. It might help to find a restroom and stay there until the bout of gas pain has subsided. If possible, stay at home and allow yourself to completely recover before going about your day. When you're in a comfortable place, relax your muscles and change your positioning so the gas can exit your body more easily."

If you experience gas problems regularly, consider avoiding or limiting these foods: [5] X Research source Legumes. Beans are difficult to digest because they contain a sugar called oligosaccharide that the body cannot break down because it doesn't produce the right enzyme to do so. The oligosaccharide molecules remain whole through most of the digestion process and produce gas in the small intestine. Foods high in fiber. Fiber has many health benefits, but eating a large amount of grains and fibrous fruits and vegetables can lead to gas. Don't stop eating these beneficial foods altogether, but you might want to avoid the ones that seem to give you the worst gas.

      "title": "Eat protein first.",
      "content": "Eat protein first. Changing the order in which you eat food can prevent the production of gas. Eating protein with or before fiber and carbohydrates allows your digestive system to work properly. When you begin eating a meal, your stomach produces hydrochloric acid in anticipation of digesting protein. If salad or bread hits your stomach first, the acid gets used up before you ingest meat, fish, or another protein. The protein then ferments, leading to gas and bloating. Health food stores sell hydrochloric acid supplements that you can take to help you digest protein. These should be taken after the meal, so your stomach has the chance to produce as much acid as it can first."
