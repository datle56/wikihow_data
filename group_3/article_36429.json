      "content": "Locate plaque using a stain. Plaque is practically invisible, so it can be very difficult to know how much is on your teeth. To overcome this, you can purchase \"disclosing tablets\" in the grocery or drugstore. Once chewed, these tablets will stain the plaque on your teeth bright red, making it easy for you to examine your teeth for plaque and identify the areas you need to target with a toothbrush. Green food coloring applied to your teeth with a cotton swab will have the same effect, staining your teeth green for easy plaque identification."

      "content": "Use the right kind of toothbrush and toothpaste. To effectively brush your teeth and ensure that you are getting rid of as much plaque as possible, it is important that you have the right tools. Although there are many fancy toothbrushes on the market, the American Dental Association states that any \"soft nylon brush with rounded-end, polished bristles\" will do the trick. [1] X Research source Hard bristled toothbrushes can be too abrasive and wear away tooth enamel and hurt your gums. Even if you are not using the correct brushing technique, soft bristles will still be better. You will also need a good fluoride toothpaste. Fluoride strengthens teeth and protects them from decay and from the formation of cavities. Electric toothbrushes are not any more effective at cleaning teeth than regular manually-operated ones. However, some people find that they are inclined to brush their teeth more regularly and for longer when they own an electric toothbrush, so investing in one may not be a bad idea. Dentists recommend that you should replace your toothbrush every 3 to 4 months, as they become less effective at cleaning over time."

      "title": "Use the correct brushing technique.",
      "content": "Use the correct brushing technique. When brushing your teeth, hold the toothbrush at a 45 degree angle against the gum line and sweep the brush away from the gums, in a short vertical, back-and-forth, or circular motions. Try not too scrub too hard, as this can actually damage the enamel on your teeth and cause high sensitivity to any type of stimulus."

      "title": "Focus on each tooth individually.",
      "content": "Focus on each tooth individually. Pay attention to each tooth as you brush, making sure that you don't miss any. Remember to brush the outer surfaces, the inner surfaces and the chewing surfaces, and pay some special attention to those hard to reach teeth at the back. Brushing your teeth properly should take about two minutes -- try using a stopwatch to get a feel it, and hum a song to yourself to pass the time."

      "title": "Remember to brush your tongue.",
      "content": "Remember to brush your tongue. Plaque can easily build up on the surface of the tongue due to food residues, so make sure to give it a little gentle scrub too. This will also help to freshen your breath. When you brush your tongue, go from the back to the front of your mouth and repeating the gentle brushing motion 4 or 5 times."

      "title": "Brush your teeth twice daily.",
      "content": "Brush your teeth twice daily. Brushing your teeth is by far the most effective way of removing plaque, and brushing properly and regularly will help to ensure that less plaque builds up over time. This is important as built-up plaque can calcify into tartar, which is a lot harder to remove. You should brush your teeth once a day at the very least, but dentists recommend brushing twice; once in the morning and once before bed. [2] X Expert Source Tu Anh Vu, DMD Board Certified Dentist Expert Interview. 20 May 2020. It is important to brush before bed because during night, bacterial flora becomes more active eliminating acids that are hard to neutralize because of the reduced flow of saliva."

      "title": "Floss between your teeth.",
      "content": "Floss between your teeth. Flossing is an essential component of effective oral hygiene, though unfortunately it is often neglected. Flossing removes bacteria and food particles from between the teeth, helping to prevent the formation of plaque. It should be done once a day, at bedtime, before brushing your teeth. Floss between teeth using a gentle sawing motion, and lifting the floss along the sides of the teeth. Avoid \"snapping\" the floss into place, as this can irritate the delicate gum tissue. [3] X Expert Source Tu Anh Vu, DMD Board Certified Dentist Expert Interview. 20 May 2020. Make sure to use a clean section of floss for between each tooth, otherwise you are just moving bacteria from one part of your mouth to another. If you find dental floss awkward to use, try using a dental pick instead. This is a small wooden or plastic stick which can be inserted between the teeth, achieving the same results as flossing."

      "title": "Use a mouthwash that targets plaque.",
      "content": "Use a mouthwash that targets plaque. Though plaque-busting mouthwashes are not effective enough to remove plaque all by themselves, when used as part of a teeth cleaning routine involving brushing and flossing, they can help to loosen plaque, while giving you minty-fresh breath in the process. Chlorhexidine digluconate is the most effective mouthwash against any type of oral bacteria, but it should not be used for more than two weeks in a row."

      "title": "Avoid sugary and starchy foods.",
      "content": "Avoid sugary and starchy foods. The bacteria found in plaque thrive on sugary and starchy foods. In fact, every time you eat these kinds of foods, the bacteria release an acid which leads to tooth decay and cavities. To avoid this, try to minimize your consumption of these types of processed foods and pay special attention to your brushing and flossing routine if you decide to indulge. [4] X Research source"

Only a dentist can give you the thorough, professional cleaning which will remove the most hard-to-reach plaque and stubborn tartar.

Simply shake a small amount of baking soda into a bowl, wet your toothbrush, then dip the bristles into the baking soda to coat. Brush your teeth as normal. If you like, you can also mix a pinch of salt into the baking powder. [6] X Research source Avoid brushing with pressure when you use baking soda as toothpaste. Also, do not use baking soda for more than five days in a row because it is abrasive and may damage your tooth enamel if you use it too often."

If you prefer to stay away from the array of chemicals found in most store-bought toothpastes, it is possible to make your own plaque-busting natural version, using just a few simple ingredients. Combine 1/2 cup of coconut oil with 2 to 3 tablespoons of baking soda, 2 little packets of stevia powder and 20 drops of your chosen essential oil, such as peppermint or cinnamon. Store your homemade toothpaste in a small glass jar and use just like regular toothpaste. [9] X Research source"
