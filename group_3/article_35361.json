If you have ongoing rectal bleeding that doesn't seem to be a result of hemorrhoids or a tear, it's a good idea to go to the doctor and get checked out. Even if you only notice a small amount on your toilet paper, it's important to get your doctor's input. [3] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Blood in the stool is a common symptom of colon cancer. Blood can make your stool look either bright red or darker than normal. Bleeding from high up in your digestive tract can make your stool look black. If you are not sure whether you see blood or not, be safe and contact your doctor anyway. Blood in your stool can also cause an unpleasant odor. If you notice a drastic change in the smell of your stool, talk to your doctor as soon as possible."
