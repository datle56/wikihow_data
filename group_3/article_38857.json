The Reminders app is geared toward reminders for things like To-Do lists, home projects, and other tasks that you don't need to add to the Calendar app. Reminders you create in the Reminders app do not appear on your Calendar, but you will be able to access them on all Apple devices (including your Mac) on which you're using the Reminders app. Read on to learn how to create a reminder in the Reminders app without Siri."
