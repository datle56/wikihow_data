      "content": "Measure the distance from one thread to the next. Hold a ruler up against the threads, lengthwise. Measure from one high point (one mountain) to the next in millimeters. You'll need a very detailed ruler for this, as the distance between threads could be as small as 0.4 millimeters. [1] X Research source This can be difficult for very fine screws, so you may want to use a pitch gauge for those if possible."

      "content": "Determine the diameter and the length of the threaded area. Measure from the bottom of the head to the end of the threaded area in millimeters. For instance, it might be 8 millimeters. Then, measure the diameter (width) of the threaded area in millimeters. This might be 4 millimeters across. [2] X Research source Always measure the major diameter, which is the distance across the threaded area from one high point of the thread to the other, instead of measuring low points that are across from each other.

Follow that with the length of the threaded area in millimeters with an M behind it. [4] X Research source Therefore, in this case, your measurement would be M4 X 0.4 X 8M."

      "content": "Measure an inch-long portion of the threaded area. Grab a ruler and lay it along the bolt or screw. Be sure to measure the threaded (or ridged) area only, starting from near the head. If your threaded area is less than an inch, measure out 1/2 an inch instead. [5] X Research source U.S. thread pitch is measured in threads per inch, so that's why you need to start by measuring out an inch of the threaded area."

      "title": "Count the number of threads in 1 inch.",
      "content": "Count the number of threads in 1 inch. When looking at the thread from the side, you'll see areas that are raised (\"mountains\") and areas that are lower (\"valleys\"). Only count the raised areas or the \"mountains,\" not the valleys. Start from one end and number each thread. When you get to 1 inch, write down your total. For instance, you might have 8 threads per inch (TPI). [6] X Research source If the threaded area is less than an inch, multiply to get an inch. For instance, if you can only measure out 1/2 an inch, multiply the number you count by 2 to get the amount that would be in a full inch. In this case, if you counted 10 threads in a half inch, you would multiply by 2 to get 20 threads per inch."

      "content": "Measure the diameter and the length of the threaded area. The diameter is the width across the screw or bolt. It's easiest to measure this with a caliper, but you can also measure it with a ruler. Measure what's known as the major diameter, which is from the top of a \"mountain\" on one side to the top of the opposite \"mountain\" directly across the screw. [7] X Research source The length is how far it is from the bottom of the head to the tip of the screw or bolt. [8] X Research source For instance, the diameter might be 1/4 of an inch and the length might be 1 inch. When using a caliper, put the arms flush against the middle part of the threads to measure the diameter. The number will pop up on the screen if it's digital; if it's not, you'll need to read the measurement on the instrument. [9] X Research source"

Line up the caliper on the outside of the threads at the bottom end, away from the head. It will tell you the width. Slide the point so it's up against the threads.The measurement should pop up on a screen if it is digital. Otherwise, you'll need to read the number on the sliding part. Do the same on the threaded area near the head. [11] X Research source If the number is larger near the head, then it's a tapered thread. If it's the same, then it's not tapered."

If it's not tapered, measure anywhere along the threads. [12] X Research source When using a caliper, you may notice there are a few places where the arms don't meet flush against each other, sometimes along the ruler edge. Do not put what you want to measure in those gaps. You should have the arms flush against the threads. [13] X Research source"

Try to fit the teeth into your threads until you find the one that matches. [14] X Research source The number for that pitch will be on the arm. It will be in TPI or in metric, depending on the type of pitch gauge you have."

Once you have the pitch, then you can measure the length of the bolt or screw from under the head and put all of your numbers into a standard measurement. A standard measurement will be the diameter, then the thread pitch or TPI, followed by the length. [15] X Research source If your measurement for a metric screw is a diameter of 4 millimeters, a thread pitch of 0.4 millimeters, and a length of 8 millimeters, your measurement would be M4 X 0.4 X 8M. For a U.S. screw, it might be 1/4 inch in diameter, 20 TPI, and 1 inch long, which you'd write like this: 1/4 inch x 20 x 1 inch. [16] X Research source"
