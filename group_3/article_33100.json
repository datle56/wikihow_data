Choose English from the language selection pop-up in the corner. Fill in the required fields and click through the confirmation screens to confirm your info and create your user ID. [1] X Research source As of August 2020, Konami’s browser version of Dance Dance Revolution is a limited version of DDR V. The company plans to release the full version with more songs at a later date. If you have a gaming console, you may be able to find a version of DDR for your system instead of downloading it on your computer. Run a search using \"your console type + dance dance revolution\" to find specific options that work for your system."

Pick English from the pop-up in the corner. Click the download link at the bottom middle of the page to download DDR using your new Konami ID. [2] X Research source The site prompts you to login before downloading if you aren’t currently logged in. The browser version of DDR works in Chrome, Edge, and Firefox. It doesn’t work in Internet Explorer. You must have at least 2GB of available memory on your computer to install the game. If you have DDR for a gaming console, you don’t have to download it. Just put the disc in your system."

[3] X Research source You don’t need any special equipment to play DDR in your browser. You can do everything right from your computer’s keyboard.

Then, choose a difficulty from beginner to expert and hit ENTER again. [4] X Research source You can listen to the music through speakers or headphones. Choose whatever makes you feel the beats the most and crank up the volume!"

      "content": "Press your arrow keys in the directions indicated by the on-screen arrows. Wait for the arrows moving up the screen from the bottom to line up with the outlines at the top of the screen. Try to press the up, down, left, or right arrow keys on your keyboard when the moving arrows are perfectly inside the matching outlines. [5] X Research source For example, if there are a left and right arrow adjacent to each other on the screen, wait until they reach the outlines of the left and right arrows at the top of the screen. Then, press the left and right arrow keys on your keyboard simultaneously. If the arrows are moving too fast for you, select the beginner difficulty option and try again. You’ll get better with practice! If you’re playing on a console, just press the arrow keys on your controller."

Go through each arrow and button and press the corresponding arrow or button on your controller to configure the controller. [6] X Research source Controllers are fun if you want to feel like you’re playing DDR on a video game console. There are tons of USB game controllers available online and some cost as little as $14 USD. Choose one similar to an Xbox controller for a more modern feel or keep it old school with one that looks like a Super Nintendo controller. If you’re playing DDR on a console, using a controller is the default way to play."

Configure the arrows on the pad in the game’s controller configuration menu by stepping on each arrow when you select the corresponding arrow in the menu. [7] X Research source Dance pads are a great way to get a work out while you play. Instead of pressing keys or buttons with your fingers, step on the arrows on the pad when the corresponding arrows reach the outlines at the top of the screen. This is similar to playing on an arcade machine. Dance Dance Revolution USB dance pads start at around $30 USD online. Keep in mind that some pads might not be as sensitive, so they won’t work perfectly. Spending a little more on a super sensitive pad might be a good idea."

There’s even a neat online tool that can help you locate DDR arcade machines near you in many different countries around the world. Check it out if you don’t know where to find one near you: https://zenius-i-vanisher.com/v5.2/arcades.php . Just choose your country and Dance Dance Revolution from the drop down menus to search."

Put in the corresponding number of coins to unlock the machine for gameplay. [9] X Research source For example, 4 credits usually means you have to put in 4 quarters. If you only have bills, you can find a change machine somewhere in the arcade to exchange your bills for coins. Typically you get to play 1 song per game play. You can add more than the minimum required credits to keep selecting additional songs after the first is over or just add more coins after each play. Either way, it’s a good idea to have some backup quarters!"

Use the arrow buttons or the arrows on the dance pad to scroll through songs until you find one you like, then press the green button to select it. Pick a difficulty on the next screen and press the green button again to start playing. [11] X Research source The harder the difficulty, the faster the arrows move (and the faster your feet have to move). If you’re new to DDR, start with an easy difficulty so you can get used to using the dance pad. You can move up in difficulty when you find your rhythm to increase the challenge, not to mention get even more of a workout!"

      "content": "Use both feet to hit the arrows accurately and get combos. Pay close attention to the arrows and timing and try to coordinate your feet to hit every note when the arrow is perfectly inside the outline. Hit multiple arrows accurately in a row to get combos and increase your score. [13] X Research source For example, if you see an up arrow followed by a down arrow and a right arrow in quick succession, use your right foot to hit the up arrow, your left foot to hit the down arrow, then your right foot to hit the right arrow. As you step on the arrows, the screen tells you how accurate you are. For example, if you see “perfect” or “marvelous,” you’re doing great! If you only see “OK” or “good,” try adjusting your timing to nail the arrows more accurately."
