      "content": "Learn the basic principles of League. There are several key aspects of gameplay that you'll need to know before jumping into a game: [4] X Research source Objective - The objective in most League maps is to destroy the enemy team's base (referred to as the \"Nexus\" in-game). Enemies - There are two main types of enemies in-game: minions, which are AI-controlled bots, and champions, which are player-controlled. There are also turrets, which auto-attack enemies, and monsters, which populate the map. Killing monsters grants your team bonuses for a small amount of time. Champions - Champions are purchased with in-game currency, but there are several free champions that new players can use each week. Lanes - Lanes are paths on maps. There are typically three lanes—top, middle, and bottom—as well as a Jungle section that fills in the space between the different lanes. Champions typically stick to one lane in the beginning of the game. XP - You earn experience (XP) from killing other champions, minions, turrets, monsters, and so on, as well as by completing in-game objectives. XP is used to level up your character's abilities; you can level up to as high as level 18 in a game. All levels are reset once a new game starts."

      "title": "Understand the different types of champions.",
      "content": "Understand the different types of champions. Different champions are suited to different roles. There are six main types of champion in the game: [5] X Research source Mage or APC - Ranged attacks. Low health, low defense, high damage. Marksman or ADC - Ranged, non-magic attacks. Low health, low defense, high damage. Tank - Melee attacks. High health, high defense, low damage. Fighter - Melee attacks. Balanced health, defense, and damage. Supporter - Varying attacks and stats. Focused on non-combat roles, such as supportive spell-casting. Assassin - Varying attacks. Low health, low defense, high mobility, and high damage."

      "title": "Know how to win.",
      "content": "Know how to win. You win by destroying the other team's Nexus. Winning in League of Legends isn't contingent on getting more kills than the other team; objective control and execution is the main strategy used to win LoL games, meaning that a successful player might only kill a few champions while controlling points on the map or focusing on farming the AI enemies for XP points, gold, and bonuses."
    },
    {
      "title": "Use minions to your advantage.",
      "content": "Use minions to your advantage. Killing a minion rewards you with gold, which can then be spent back at your team's Store (near the Nexus) to redeem weapons and consumable items. A vital component of League of Legends is resource denial, which entails killing minions while preventing champions from the other team from killing your team's minions. This will allow you to level up while they remain at a low level."
    },
    {
      "title": "Prioritize structure destruction over champion kills.",
      "content": "Prioritize structure destruction over champion kills. Destroying enemy turrets and inhibitors will weaken your enemies' defenses, making it easier for you to access and destroy their Nexus. It may seem like going after champions is helpful to your team—and in some cases, it is—but the main initial goal should be to eliminate as many structures as possible. Destroying an enemy inhibitor will also prompt your inhibitors to spawn super minions, which are high-health, high-damage AI units that can distract the enemy team for quite some time."

      "title": "Support your team with items and buffs.",
      "content": "Support your team with items and buffs. Things like Wards, which increase the distance that your team can see, help your team gain an advantage over the enemy. Similarly, if you have non-offensive abilities that buff your team, using these abilities to support teammates is key. [6] X Research source Killing any jungle monster will reward your whole team with a buff, though the buff will vary depending on the monster. For example, killing the giant toad monster will apply poison damage to all of your teammates' attacks for a limited time."

      "title": "Keep an eye on your health.",
      "content": "Keep an eye on your health. If you have healing items, you can heal yourself if your health gets too low during a fight, or if your health is almost depleted following a fight. If you don't have healing items, you may need to teleport back to the spawning area once you're safe. This is typically accomplished by pressing the B key."

      "title": "Communicate with your team.",
      "content": "Communicate with your team. There's a chatbar in-game that allows you to tell your team mates where an enemy champion is and what they're doing. While you don't need to update your team on every minor occurrence, make sure that you're paying attention to the normal aspects of the battle and reporting any irregular instances. Keep your communications positive and clean. Negativity and bad language are generally against the League of Legends code of conduct."

    {
      "title": "Play your role.",
      "content": "Play your role. Perhaps the most important aspect of any multiplayer game is playing your selected character's role. If you're a marksman champion, for example, it doesn't help your team for you to try taking on tank champions at point-blank range. Similarly, tank characters should stick to lanes or places on the map in which they can deny resources to the enemy team rather than trying to go on a rampage. [7] X Research source There are very few points in LoL gameplay in which you'll be the sole reason that your team won. Playing your role and sticking to your objective while everyone else does the same is the best way to ensure victory."
