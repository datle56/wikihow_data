      "content": "Classify the temperature. [1] X Research source If the baby has a temperature of 37-37.5℃ (98.6 - 99.5℉), then it isn't regarded as fever. Remove some layers of clothing and, if appropriate, bedding. This can cool your baby down, particularly in warm weather. If the temperature comes down just from altering baby's clothing or bedding, there's no need to do anything further. If the baby is still hot, strip them down to their singlet, vest or a short-sleeved baby grow with no leggings section and a nappy or diaper. Cover him or her with a light, preferably cotton, sheet. If the temperature is 37.5-38℃ (99.5 - 100.4℉), then he or she isn't experiencing a fever either. A bath or shower with lukewarm (not cool) water can lower body temperature. Keep bedding and clothing light. When the temperature is about 38-38.5℃ (100.4 - 101.3℉) then the baby is having a fever. Baby will need some medical attention in this case. Usually prescribed medicine can work. Go to doctor for a check up. If the temperature is about 38.5-39℃ (101.3 - 102.2℉) then they will definitely need medication (such as infant paracetamol) to reduce their temperature. You can strip your baby down, and possibly give them a tepid bath for some improvement however medical attention is needed. If your baby has 39-40℃ (102.2 - 104℉) then it needs immediate medical attention. The baby may be in danger of experiencing a 'fit' or a 'febrile convulsion'. Contact a doctor immediately! Infant febrile convulsions can be terrifying for a parent to witness. Try not to panic and remember that the fit is due to your baby being too warm and not any other more worrying illnesses or conditions."
