      "content": "Make a guest list. Include all the people you wish to invite to your party. The number of people you invite will depend on the size of the room and on how many guests you can have over. Since a pajama party can range in size from a few close friends to a larger number of people that you know, it’s important to have an idea of how many people you actually want and can have at the party before sending out invitations."

      "title": "Write the invitations.",
      "content": "Write the invitations. You can buy pre-made pajama party invitations at retailers like Zazzle or you can make your own. You can also create a Facebook event for the party. The invitation should include the following information: Date of the party. Consider hosting the party on a Friday or Saturday night. That way, you and your friends will be able to recover and catch up on sleep the next day. Time the party will start and end. Sleepover pajama parties usually start no earlier than 5 p.m. and go until 10 a.m. If your pajama party is not actually a sleepover and is instead just a party in your PJs, specify this and give an idea of when the party will end so guests can plan accordingly.

      "content": "Send timely invitations. If you invite people too close to the day of the party, you run the risk of there being overlapping events or conflicts. Avoid this by letting your friends know about the party at least 2 weeks ahead of time."

      "title": "Set the location.",
      "content": "Set the location. Traditional slumber parties take place indoors, usually in the living room or the bedroom of the hostess. However, if you want to take your party to the next level, consider hosting an outdoors pajama party using the backyard as the party area. You can also set up tents as your shelter."

      "title": "Pick out games to play.",
      "content": "Pick out games to play. From video games to board games to pajama party classics like truth or dare, the possibilities are endless. Set aside a few games that you know most of your friends like playing. During the party, let your friends vote on which ones they would like to play."

      "title": "Make a list of activities.",
      "content": "Make a list of activities. A pajama party can be a great time if you and your friends just talk the night away. However, having a few activities planned out can make the night even more fun. You and your guests could: Make homemade spa treatments. These can range from applying face masks - cucumbers for the eyes are a must - to doing mani/pedis or makeovers. Snap before and after pictures. Set up a selfie wall. Hang fabric on a wall and print out signs that you can use as props for an amazing photobooth-like experience. [2] X Research source Create a dance routine. Look up YouTube videos for choreography inspiration or try to mimic your favorite artist’s moves. Record yourselves for a fun memory to look back on. Do karaoke. If you have a karaoke machine, this would be the perfect time to use it. If you don’t have one, look up song instrumentals on YouTube to sing along with or simply sing loudly over the track. You can use hairbrushes or water bottles as your microphones. Make a pillow fort . If you have big couch cushions, you can use these as ‘walls.’ Thin sheets or blankets make the perfect roof."

      "content": "Buy snacks. The perfect snacks for pajama parties are fun finger-foods. Your best bets are popcorn, pretzels, and chips, plus some fruit for good measure. [3] X Research source These snacks are delicious and easy to clean up. If you can, purchase a variety of snacks so that your friends have a variety of options to choose from. Don’t forget to buy disposable cups, napkins, and plates. Only buy caffeinated drinks or sodas if you plan on you or your friends being awake all night. [4] X Research source Ask your friends to let you know if they're allergic to any food so that you can avoid serving it."

      "title": "Decorate the room.",
      "content": "Decorate the room. Balloons and streamers are great decorations regardless of the theme of the pajama party. Dim or turn off the main lights and add fairy lights instead to create a cozier atmosphere. Pick a theme for the party and decorate accordingly. For example, if you’re having a rockstar-themed pajama party, you could have decorations like CDs or cutouts of music notes taped to the walls. You might even lay down a red carpet for your friends to pose on. If your pajama party is outdoors, count on setting up tents and having flashlights ready."

      "title": "Prepare party favors.",
      "content": "Prepare party favors. This only applies if your pajama party doubles as a birthday party. Party favors could vary from store-bought trinkets, like mini-notebooks or key chains, to something you make with your guests at the party, like friendship bracelets or tye-dye shirts. If you plan to create party favors during the event, make sure to gather all the necessary items beforehand. For example, if you’re making keepsake collages, set aside glue, paper, scissors, and magazines the day before the party. You might also provide toothbrushes and toothpaste for your guests - these often go forgotten at pajama parties, but they are a thoughtful detail."
