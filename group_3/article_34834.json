      "title": "Spread the weighted blanket flat on your bed.",
      "content": "Spread the weighted blanket flat on your bed. Take your weighted blanket and lay it out so there aren't wrinkles or bumps on the surface. You can do this on your bed, floor, or any clean, flat surface. [1] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Turn your duvet cover inside out.",
      "content": "Turn your duvet cover inside out. Reach your hands inside the duvet cover and grab each of the bottom corners. Pull them up towards you so you flip the fabric inside out in the process. [2] X Research source You should see the duvet cover strings sticking out along the sides of the cover. You'll tie these to the loops on the weighted blanket."
    },
    {
      "title": "Tie the loops on the duvet to the weighted blanket.",
      "content": "Tie the loops on the duvet to the weighted blanket. Take the short loops at the bottom corner of the duvet and feed 1 through a corner loop of the blanket. Then, tie a simple tight knot. Do this for the other corner and for all the loops on the sides, too. [3] X Research source Tying the loops keeps the weighted blanket from sliding around inside the duvet cover."
    },
    {
      "title": "Reach inside the duvet cover and pull it over the weighted blanket.",
      "content": "Reach inside the duvet cover and pull it over the weighted blanket. Find the opening end of the duvet cover and slide your arms down into the corners at the end. Grab the corners of the cover and the corners of the weighted blanket. Then, pull your arms back out so the duvet fabric flips right side out with the blanket on the inside. [4] X Research source Hold the corners of the blanket and duvet and shake both a few times so the cover unrolls. Then, straighten out the cover as needed."
    },
    {
      "title": "Fasten the opening and shake out the weighted blanket.",
      "content": "Fasten the opening and shake out the weighted blanket. If your duvet cover has a zipper edge, zip it closed to keep the weighted blanket inside. Don't have a zipper? Your cover might have loops to tie, buttons, or snaps instead. Once you've closed up your duvet cover, shake out the blanket to smooth it out. [5] X Research source Shake out the weighted blanket occasionally to redistribute the plastic poly pellets or weighted filling."

    {
      "title": "Turn the cover inside out and lay it flat on your bed.",
      "content": "Turn the cover inside out and lay it flat on your bed. Take a duvet cover that matches the size of your blanket and flip it inside out so you can see the strings on the inside corners. Then, lay it flat on a bed or clean floor and smooth out any wrinkles. Position the cover so the opening is near the foot of your bed or closest to you. [6] X Research source You can put a duvet cover on any size weighted blanket, but it will be easier if you're working with a smaller blanket."

    {
      "title": "Lay the weighted blanket on the cover so the sides line up.",
      "content": "Lay the weighted blanket on the cover so the sides line up. If you toss the weighted blanket on the cover and try pulling it in place, it will probably shift the cover underneath it. Instead, fold the weighted blanket in half lengthwise. Then, fold it in half lengthwise again and set it on 1 corner of the cover. Then, unfold it so the blanket covers the duvet. [7] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Tie the duvet cover strings through the blanket loops on each side.",
      "content": "Tie the duvet cover strings through the blanket loops on each side. Match up the strings on the duvet cover with the loops on your weighted blanket. To tie them, stick one of the short strings through the loop on the blanket and pull it through. Then, tie it into a tight knot with the other string. Repeat this for each loop around the blanket. [8] X Research source Some weighted blankets and duvet covers use a zipper instead. If your blanket and cover have this, just zip them together along each side."

      "title": "Roll the duvet cover and blanket from the headboard to the footboard.",
      "content": "Roll the duvet cover and blanket from the headboard to the footboard. Curl the duvet cover over the blanket near the headboard. Keep rolling the fabric tightly until you reach the opposite end. [9] X Research source If you're working with a large weighted blanket, ask a friend to help you roll. This way, one of you can be on each side of the bed as you roll it down to the end."

      "title": "Pull the right side of the duvet cover around the rolled-up blanket.",
      "content": "Pull the right side of the duvet cover around the rolled-up blanket. Now that you've got the blanket and cover rolled up like a hot dog, find the opening along the edge. Reach in and pull the duvet cover over the entire rolled up piece so you can see the right side of the cover. [10] X Research source It can help to do 1 end at a time. Then, pull the duvet fabric over the length of the rolled-up piece. If your weighted blanket and cover use a zipper, you might have to zip along the rolled-up edge before you unroll it all."

    {
      "title": "Unroll the fabric toward the headboard so the blanket is covered.",
      "content": "Unroll the fabric toward the headboard so the blanket is covered. Pull the middle of your rolled-up blanket and duvet toward the headboard so it starts to unroll. You'll see as you're doing this that the weighted blanket is now inside the cover and all you have to do is smooth it out so it's flat. [11] X Research source Want to get the duvet cover off? Just reverse the process so the weighted blanket comes out on top. You can untie it and wash the cover whenever you need to."
