      "content": "Sprinting spikes take 8 or more spikes for speed and power. [2] X Research source The spikes are normally positioned towards the front since sprinters spend most of the race on their toes⁠; there is minimal cushioning in the heel area. Sprinting spikes are quite stiff, and also the lightest running shoe. [3] X Research source Sprinting spikes are best for 100, 200, and 400 meter events. 6mm spikes are best for track and field events and are the most versatile spike. Spikes come in many lengths, but spikes longer than 6mm are actually illegal on many tracks. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Middle distance spikes have 6-8 spike holes.",
      "content": "Middle distance spikes have 6-8 spike holes. They are less rigid and contain more cushioning to provide support for longer distances, but are still fairly light. [5] X Research source Middle distance spikes are ideal for 800, 1500, 1600, and mile distances⁠—but can also be used for 400 and 2 mile events. They’re the best option if you’re not sure about what events you’re competing in, or if you compete in a wide range of events."

      "title": "Long distance spikes usually have 4 spike holes.",
      "content": "Long distance spikes usually have 4 spike holes. They’re made from more durable but heavier materials to hold up against the long distances, and can take on more force. [6] X Research source Long distance spikes are recommended for distances of 1500 meters to 10000 meters."

      "title": "Cross country spikes use longer spike pins.",
      "content": "Cross country spikes use longer spike pins. They’re developed for running on uneven terrain, so they also provide more ankle support and a more secure fit. [7] X Research source 9mm spikes give a good grip for cross country running in muddy and wet conditions. You may want to go with 12-15mm spikes for very muddy conditions."

      "content": "Find the spike holes in the upper sole of the shoe. When you turn the shoe over, you should see various metal holes, which is what the spikes twist into. [8] X Research source Remember that the number of spike holes varies depending on what kind of track spikes you have."

      "content": "Unscrew any old spikes with your spike key or wrench. If you’re replacing worn down spikes, you’ll have to remove the old ones first. Align the spike key opening with the pointy end of the spike and twist to the left until the spike comes out of the hole. Repeat the unscrewing process for each remaining hole. [9] X Research source If your shoes are new, you won’t need to remove any old spikes. Make sure you unscrew every single old spike before you begin putting in the new ones."
