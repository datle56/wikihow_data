      "content": "Make your move. You can only make one move per turn. There are three different moves: Reload: Make the shape of a gun and point it up in the air. You must reload at least once before shooting. Reloads can be accumulated. A certain number of accumulated reloads grants a specific weapon. One reload gives a pistol, three gives a machine gun, and five a shotgun. Shoot: Pantomime the action of shooting your opponent. You may use any weapon that the number of reloads you have allows for. For example, if you only have one reload you can only fire your pistol once, but if you have three reloads you can either fire your pistol three times (that is, across three separate turns without needing to reload) or fire your machine gun once. Make sure that it is clear which weapon you are shooting your opponent with. You may only fire ONE shot per turn (one pistol shot, one machine gun shot, etc.) Block: Cross your arms over your chest. This will block all shots. In simple shotgun, your shield can never be compromised."

If both players shoot each other at the same time, whoever has the more powerful weapon wins (the machine gun overpowers the pistol, the shotgun overpowers the machine gun and pistol). If the weapons are of the same strength, the game is a draw."

You must reload at least once before shooting. Reloads can be accumulated. A certain number of accumulated reloads grants a specific weapon. One reload gives a pistol, three gives a machine gun, five a shotgun, and ten a bazooka. Shoot: Pantomime the action of shooting your opponent. You may use any weapon that the number of reloads you have allows for. For example, if you only have one reload you can only fire your pistol once, but if you have three reloads you can either fire your pistol three times (that is, across three separate turns without needing to reload) or fire your machine gun once. Make sure that it is clear which weapon you are shooting your opponent with. You may only fire ONE shot per turn (one pistol shot, one machine gun shot, etc.) Block: Cross your arms over your chest. This will block all shots. Your \"shield\" can now only take a limited amount of damage before you either die or can no longer block. It can take 9 damage, while the player can take 1 damage. The damage a weapon inflicts generally depends on how much reloads it requires to fire, with a few exceptions: the knife and the pistol cannot damage the shield (but will still do 1 damage to the player, killing them). The machine gun does 3 damage, the shotgun does 5 damage, and the bazooka does 10 damage (making it unblockable in practice). Take Out Knife: Pantomime the action of taking out some sort of bladed weapon. This only has to be done once. Once your knife has been taken out, you may now stab as one of your moves. Stab: Pantomime the motion of stabbing your opponent with a knife. You must have already taken out your knife on a previous turn. Stabbing does not require any reloading. Emergency reload: This is an optional rule. Players may be allowed to block and reload at the same time, once per game. Cross your arms over your chest, with one hand in the shape of a gun. You must also announce that you are using your emergency reload."
