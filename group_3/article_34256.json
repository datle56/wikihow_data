If the crate is large enough that your dog can comfortably poop in a corner he might choose to go in his crate rather than wait to be let out. Your dog's crate should be just big enough for him to stand up and turn around in and lie down with his legs straight. Anything bigger might make him tempted to use the crate as a bathroom.

Crates can get expensive and you do not want to have to keep replacing a crate, but you can block off the excess crate space with cardboard paper, styrofoam, or other puppy safe materials.

You do not need to close your dog in the crate at meal times, as the stress of being locked in may interfere with his ability to eat. Just set the food inside his crate and leave the door open.

If you leave the food out and go about your regular activities he should eventually eat. [4] X Research source"

Your dog will not want to defecate in an area if he enjoys cuddling and sleeping there.

      "content": "Crate train your dog before leaving him alone in a crate. If you're just starting to leave your dog alone in his crate and he's eliminating in it, the problem is probably that he's not used to the crate. A dog should be introduced to his crate gradually before he can be left alone in the crate safely. Allow your dog a few days to get used to the crate. Encourage him to enter the crate, but do not lock it. Make the crate a pleasant experience by providing your dog with treats and praise for entering the crate. [8] X Trustworthy Source The Humane Society of the United States National organization devoted to the promotion of animal welfare Go to source Once your dog is used to the crate, you can begin closing him in it for small periods at time. Start small, only leaving him in the crate for about 10 minutes at a time, and then gradually increase the duration. [9] X Trustworthy Source The Humane Society of the United States National organization devoted to the promotion of animal welfare Go to source Once your dog is able to spend 30 minutes in his crate without becoming anxious or afraid, you can begin leaving him for longer periods. Always be matter of fact when leaving. Dragging out a departure by saying a long goodbye to your canine can make his anxiety about being left alone worse. [10] X Trustworthy Source The Humane Society of the United States National organization devoted to the promotion of animal welfare Go to source You can gradually increase the amount of time you leave your dog alone in the crate, eventually working up to leaving him in the crate overnight and while you're at work.

      "content": "Keep a consistent walk schedule. If your dog is having problems with eliminating in his crate, his walk schedule might not be consistent enough. Make sure you walk your dog at regular intervals so he does not have to resort to going in his crate. Simply leaving your dog outside will not necessarily teach him he's supposed to toilet outdoors. When potty training stay outside with him and praise him when he goes to the toilet spot. If you don't do this the risk is he may just regard outdoors as a playground, and not take the opportunity to relieve himself. Depending on your dog's age, he'll need more or less time outside. If he's under 12 weeks, he should be let out once an hour during the day and every 3 to 4 hours during the night. [12] X Research source As he gets older, you can gradually increase the increments of time between walks. By the time he's 6 to 7 months old, you should be letting him out about every 4 hours during the day and every 8 hours at night. An adult dog should be let out at least three times a day, and preferably get at least one longer walk during that time. [13] X Research source Consistency is key. Try to let your dog out around the same time each day. Your dog's body will adapt to a regular schedule and that should result in less accidents. [14] X Research source"

Eating stimulates the bowel about 20 minutes later. Don't give the dog a meal and immediately crate him as he may then get caught short. Instead, give him a chance to toilet outside, around 20 to 30 minutes after eating. How much food your dog needs depends on his breed, size, and any medical conditions he might have. You can talk to your vet about how much food is appropriate for your dog and then decide how to best divide up feeding times throughout the day. [16] X Research source If you crate your dog overnight, do not give him food or water 3 hours before bed time. If you crate your dog during the day while you're at work, make sure to give him a longer walk in the morning so he has a chance to relieve himself after breakfast. [17] X Research source"

If you wake up in the morning and find he's gone in his crate, scolding him then is probably not helpful. He will not understand what he's being scolded over. You should also avoid overly aggressive or loud scolding, as this can lead to anxiety that could potentially make the problem worse. Never rub your dog's nose in his feces or urine, as this will only serve to upset and confuse your dog.
