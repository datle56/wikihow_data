      "content": "Learn how electricity works. The first step in preventing a dangerous situation is to understand the cause of electric shock. Read books, articles, websites and blogs about electricity and safety measures to take when working with electricity. In basic terms, electricity naturally tries to flow to the earth or ground through any and all materials that will conduct an electrical current. [1] X Research source Certain compounds, like wood and glass, are poor conductors of electricity. Other materials, like seawater and many metals, conduct very well. The human body is able to conduct a current largely due to the amount of sodium and water in the body, and an electric shock happens when electricity flows through parts of the body. [2] X Research source This happens most often when a direct source of electricity is exposed to human contact. It may also flow into a person through another conductor, like a pool of water or a metal pole. To learn more about electricity and the cause of electric shock, read about it here or ask a trusted electrician."

      "content": "Know your limits. There are some simple electrical problems around the house that you can handle yourself. However, any time you are having serious or major electrical issues, you should hire a professional electrician. It may be expensive, but it is cheaper than a stint in the hospital. [3] X Research source There are essentially two types of electricians you can hire, “master” electricians and “journeyman” electricians. Both types are usually licensed by the state - but not always. Master electricians generally own businesses and can employ other licensed electricians and helpers or apprentices, while journeyman electricians can work for a master electrician or be self-employed and hire a single helper or apprentice. The rules of what each type of electrician may do and may not do varies by state, county or locality."

Know the specific types of circuit breakers, fuses, and even lightbulbs that are required in your home. Make sure to replace them with the right parts when needed. Using incompatible parts could cause the equipment to function improperly, create an unsafe condition that may result in fire, injury or death."

      "title": "Turn the electricity off.",
      "content": "Turn the electricity off. The first step that you need to take before attempting to fix any electrical problems yourself is to turn the electricity off in your home. This helps to ensure that, even if you make a mistake, you won't be electrocuted. There will be a main electrical panel somewhere in your home (usually in a basement or garage). This panel has a simple on/off switch that allows you to cut the flow of electricity to your entire house. Make sure the switch on this panel is flipped to “off” before attempting any repairs."

      "title": "Install GFCI breakers and outlets.",
      "content": "Install GFCI breakers and outlets. GFCI, or Ground Fault Circuit Interrupter, devices are able to detect imbalances in the amount of electricity flowing through a circuit and will cut off power at the GFCI device. GFCI receptacles are required in most new construction homes in places where electric shock is most likely – near sinks, in the bathroom, over kitchen counters, in the garage, and outdoors – and can typically be installed in older homes for a low cost. [5] X Research source A GFCI breaker provides both overcurrent and ground fault combination; these are often referred to as \"residual current circuit breaker with overcurrent protection\" or RCBO outside of North America. Test GFCI outlets regularly. When you press the \"TEST\" button the breaker should trip. Confirm that the circuit is indeed dead by plugging a tester in. After resetting, current should return."

      "content": "Avoid common mistakes. There are a handful of common mistakes people make when attempting to make electrical fixes in their homes. You need to be aware of these mistakes and take all the necessary precautions to avoid. Some things to avoid are: Avoid touching a bare wire that may be conducting a current. Avoid overloading power strips and other receptacles with multiple plugs. Using only two plugs per outlet lessens the risk of shock and fire. [6] X Research source Ground your appliances. The ground prong provides a quick electrical return in the event that electricity flows where it is not supposed to. This will often trigger overcurrent protection and de-energize the source before a fire can start. The ground wire should be connected to any external casing and to the ground on the outlet. Inside, ground should have almost no electrical potential to neutral and should be connected to metal pipes, metal beams, to a grounding rod outside, etc. to redirect current away from people in the event of a fault. [7] X Research source Most safety equipment such as overcurrent breakers and GFCI breakers do not function correctly if there is no ground connection. Never assume that someone else turned off the power source. Always check for yourself!"

      "title": "Avoid water.",
      "content": "Avoid water. Store and use electric devices away from water. Water and electricity do not mix well and appliances should always be kept away from any moisture. This will prevent any accidental shocks from occurring. Never use an electrical appliance while in the bath or shower. [8] X Research source If your toaster or another electric appliance is near your kitchen sink, never use the running water and the appliance at the same time. Keep it unplugged when not in use. [9] X Research source Store outdoor electrical equipment in a place where it will be kept dry, like a garage shelf. [10] X Research source If a plugged-in appliance falls into water, do not attempt to retrieve it until you turn off power to the corresponding circuit. Once the power is off, you may retrieve the device. Once it is dry, it can be evaluated by an electrician to see if it is suitable for future use. [11] X Research source"

Once you have made the necessary repairs and are ready to test the appliance or outlet you have fixed, turn the power switch on your main panel back to the “on” position. You may need to reset your circuit breakers as well. To do this, flip the switch on each individual breaker to “off”, then flip it back to “on”."

      "content": "Be sure that the appliance is set at the appropriate settings for the outlet you are plugging in. In a country that uses a higher voltage, there is a higher wattage, which can damage your electronics and risk electrical shock. Make sure that the appliance is set to the appropriate voltage input, and use a 100-240V to 110V or 220V transformer to avoid mistakes caused by accidentally plugging in appliances into the wrong voltage. Understand that the key difference between an adapter and a transformer is that an adapter just allows the appliance to be plugged in, but a transformer steps the voltage to the correct voltage. For chargers, an adapter is fine, but for laundry machines, kitchen appliances, hairdryers, and other appliances without a built-in transformer, use a transformer."
