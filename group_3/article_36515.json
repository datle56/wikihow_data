Mix warm water and dish soap in a bucket or bowl, and dip a rag into it. Wash over the sticker and the surrounding area several times to soften the adhesive, then slowly peel the sticker up with the help of a credit card or another plastic or rubber straight edge. If any residue remains, continue scrubbing and scraping with the soapy water and credit card. Or, apply an adhesive remover like Goo Gone ."

      "title": "Hair dryer",
      "content": "Hair dryer One of the most common ways to remove stubborn bumper stickers is to blast them with heat. If you have an extension cord, grab a hair dryer and plug it in outside. Turn it onto a low setting and slowly run it back and forth across the sticker, about 6 inches (15 cm) away. After a few minutes, this will loosen the adhesive so you can start peeling up a corner of the sticker. Use a credit card or a rubber spatula to pull the sticker up. [1] X Research source It may help if you first rub the sticker with a damp cloth. You can also use a heat gun , but these are stronger than hair dryers, so be careful not to damage your car’s surface."

      "content": "Remove stickers from your windshield or windows with a razor blade. In general, it’s much easier to remove stickers from glass than the metal or plastic parts of your car. According to Zani, “One of the old tricks that hasn’t really changed much in the last 20 years is using a razor blade on glass.” Take a razor blade, being careful not to cut yourself, and slowly peel up a corner of the sticker. Then, continue peeling it away with your hand. Use the blade to remove any stubborn residue, as well. After scraping off the sticker or decal, Zani says, “If there’s glue residue, use a new razor and you should be able to remove the glue residue as well. Use a quick decal spray, or even glass cleaner, as a lubricant for the razor.” Do not use a metal razor blade anywhere other than your car’s glass, as it may scratch or damage the paint."
