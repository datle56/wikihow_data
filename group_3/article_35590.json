      "title": "Consider whether the stim is actually harmful.",
      "content": "Consider whether the stim is actually harmful. Just because a stim is a little odd or noticeable doesn't mean that it's a bad stim. A stim is bad if it fulfills one or more of these criteria: Does it cause physical harm? (biting, head-banging) Does it pose a health risk? (placing objects in the mouth, spinning until she falls down) Does it make a mess or destroy things? (ripping paper) Does it violate others' personal space? (playing with their hair without permission) Does the autistic child say they want to change the stim?"

      "content": "Let them be themselves, even if it's \"weird.\" You may be worried about whether the child will fit in and how they will be treated. But teaching them to suppress their natural instincts and hide their feelings isn't a good answer. It is the bullies who need the behavior change, not their victim. If you supervise a group of children, talk to them about differences and how to be a good friend. Teach that bullying is wrong and give advice on how to help if they witness bullying. Take reports of bullying very seriously. Cultivate an atmosphere of respect for individual differences. Children will model their behavior after yours."

      "content": "Consider whether it is worth the energy to redirect. Teaching takes time and effort. It can be even more effort for the autistic child, if the new stim doesn't work quite as well. Trying to redirect too many stims can harm their self-esteem and ability to focus. Save serious interventions for serious cases. Stimming can help kids stay calm and self-regulate.

      "content": "Rule out medical issues. Pain, illness, and discomfort can trigger dramatic stims. Notice if they seem to hit a specific body part. That may be a sign that something is wrong there. Take them to a doctor and ask for that place to be checked. Treating the health issue may make the dangerous stim disappear. [3] X Research source For example, a child who hits their head may be suffering from migraines, a toothache, a headache, or lice."

      "content": "Consider what need the child is trying to address. Stimming is a tool. Talk to the child about it if you can, or draw hypotheses based on your log.

Try reading blogs and reaching out through the #AskingAutistics hashtag. Read from autistic adults who had the same stims. What did they use as replacements? Did the replacements work? Try making an account under a fake name and posting about the problem in the #AskingAutistics hashtag. Autistic people tend to patrol this hashtag and will likely come to offer help."

      "title": "Take the child aside and explain your feelings about their harmful stim.",
      "content": "Take the child aside and explain your feelings about their harmful stim. Make it clear why this stim is not a good one, so that they recognize that there is a good reason for them to stop. Then propose your suggestions. For example, \"It worries me when I see you hitting your head like that. You could hurt yourself. I'm sure it's not fun for you either. Let's talk about what we can do to keep you safe.\""

      "title": "Have a dialogue about the stim.",
      "content": "Have a dialogue about the stim. Ask your child if they have any ideas for replacement stims, and what they think would help them use the harmful stim less. If their ideas are incorporated into the plan, it helps them feel ownership of the process. \"Do you think chewy jewelry would help?\" \"Would you like to help me pick out some jewelry from the website?\" \"This is the list of ideas I wrote. What do you think? What could we add or change?\" \"Let's go to the store this afternoon, and you can pick out the stim toys you want to try.\""

For example, if your son puts objects in his mouth, and the two of you decide that gum is better, he may not have gum on hand all the time. Make it clear that whenever he wants gum, all he needs to do is ask, and you'll give it to him."

For example, if your student hits herself when she's upset, talk to her about what makes her so upset, and what you can do to help. Maybe she can't handle noisy classrooms, or she's struggling with English, or she has an underlying condition that's giving her headaches. Address the underlying problem and the bad stim may disappear."

Does it belong in your mouth?\" \"What belongs in your mouth?\" \"What do we do when we want to play with hair?\" \"Remember, when we want to spin, we stop before we get dizzy.

Use a very patient tone of voice, and ask as little of them as possible to avoid further stressing them. If they are in danger of harming themselves, give a gentle reminder. Otherwise, choose to remind them once they're calm or just let it slide. \"Julie, I understand you're upset and hurting. Why don't we put a pillow between your hands and your head so you don't injure yourself?\" \"Please be gentle with your hands. You can bite this.\" \"Rosario, I saw that you were hitting yourself this morning. You seemed very upset, and I was worried about you.

Thank you for asking.\" \"Rosario, I'm glad that you told me that the classroom was too loud as soon as it started bothering you. You didn't hit yourself once! Feel free to come to me any time you're getting really upset.\" \"Julie, I just wanted to say how brave and strong you were, head-butting the couch cushions today instead of punching yourself. You did a wonderful job handling your frustration, and I'm proud of you.\" \"Alison, thank you for biting your chewy necklace instead of your hand.

While a meltdown can't be stopped once it has started, you may be able to prevent it (or at least reduce its severity) by helping calm the child. Preventative measures may stop or reduce self-injury and other harmful stims. If you see the child getting too stressed... Reduce demands and sensory input. Let them take a break somewhere quiet.

If it's on your phone, move it around (from one ear to the other or close and then far). Throwing objects or throwing themselves to the floor: Try a swing, trampoline, or bouncer. If they're small enough, you can pick them up and spin them around or toss them onto a safe place (like a bed or soft sofa).

Here is what you can try if the child is... Hitting themselves: Place a cushion to soften blows. Pounding on objects: Show them a couch cushion or bed and say \"Hit that.\" Throwing objects: Grab some durable and harmless objects, like pillows or stuffed toys, and put them in reach. Let the child throw these. Then fetch them so the child can throw again. Move fragile or dangerous objects out of reach. Keep bringing them back until the child calms down.

Only take your child to therapy that they enjoy (or at minimum, feel neutral towards). Make it clear to other adults that your child's differences are to be respected. ABA therapy can be dangerous , particularly if done by providers who aren't careful in their approach. Be cautious about compliance-based therapies, as they may harm more than they help. Steer your child away from negative or unkind people. If your child is mistreated, talk to them and explain that what happened wasn't okay and the child didn't deserve it. Autism cannot be cured or ethically suppressed. If someone is claiming that they can do this, beware."

Growing up is not only about improving one's weaknesses, but building upon one's strengths. The last thing you want is for the child to end up feeling over-corrected or dependent on adults for help. Give them praise and encouragement, and don't overdo the advice."

Paying attention to the child's communication encourages them to communicate more. Help them learn to recognize their needs and ask for help when they need it. If the child isn't communicating reliably or clearly yet, a good speech and language pathologist (SLP) may be able to teach them to speak and/or use another form of communication (like picture cards, sign language, or typing). Ask clarifying questions and slow down if the child is struggling to communicate or seems frustrated."

Treat them with compassion, and presume competence, and treat them like they want to behave well. Stay patient and kind even when the child acts out. This helps them know that they can count on you when they're upset. Make time for self-care, especially when you feel like you're at the end of your rope. A calm adult is a helpful adult, so do what helps you feel calm and balanced."
