      "content": "Decide on an email provider. There are countless different email providers—most of which are free to sign up for and use—but the three most popular ones are the following: Gmail — Google mail. Signing up for Gmail also creates a Google account, which is useful for YouTube and other large social media sites. Outlook — Microsoft-created mail. An Outlook account is required for some Microsoft services such as Microsoft Word (or Office 365), Windows 10, Skype, and Xbox LIVE. Yahoo — Yahoo is a simple email provider with features like news in your inbox and a terabyte of online storage. All three of the above email providers have mobile apps for your smartphone available for free. This will allow you to send and receive email from your smartphone via your favorite provider."
