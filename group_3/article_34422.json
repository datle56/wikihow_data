They will not experience any symptoms and will not feel sick. They also will not be infectious and cannot spread TB to others. A skin test will indicate TB infection. However, if the patient’s body stops being able to fight off the bacteria, they can become ill with TB disease. They may become ill shortly after being infected, or they might feel fine for years until their immune system is weakened by something else. TB disease occurs when a patient’s body cannot keep the TB bacteria from multiplying. They will feel sick and experience symptoms. People with TB disease are infectious and can spread the bacteria to others. A skin test will indicate TB infection."

The label should also specify a beyond-use date indicating how long after its initial opening a vial can still be used. If the beyond-use date has passed, don’t use the vial. Your local health department will be able to let you know the exact number of days after a multidose vial is opened before you must discard it.
