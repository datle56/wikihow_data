[1] X Expert Source Patrick Johns Home Improvement Specialist Expert Interview. 5 April 2022. Turn the valve clockwise to shut off the water to the faucet. After that, turn on your faucets to drain the excess water from the lines. [2] X Research source You may have a single water valve for the entire faucet, or you may have two separate valves for hot and cold water. Make sure you turn all of the valves off so no water is running through them. If you have trouble locating the shutoff valve for your bathroom faucet or if the faucet still runs, turn off the main water supply to your home."

      "content": "Disconnect the P-trap and sink drain (if you’re replacing the drain too). The P-trap is the curved section of pipe underneath your sink connecting the drain to the wall. Unscrew the pipe connections on your P-trap by turning them counterclockwise by hand or with a crescent wrench . Then, unscrew the metal nut on the bottom of your drain to loosen it from the sink. After that, just finish unscrewing the vertical drain pipe and pulling the stopper out from the top of the drain. [3] X Research source Some new faucet assemblies come with a new stopper and waste pipe, so it’s the perfect opportunity to replace the drain. Many faucets are compatible with your existing drain and stopper. If you don’t want to replace the drain, then you don’t need to disconnect the P-trap. Just find the horizontal metal rod coming out from the drain under your sink and disconnect the rod by sliding off the clip."

      "content": "Undo the water supply lines with a basin wrench . A basin wrench has a long handle so you can reach and unscrew the nuts under your bathroom faucet. To use your basin wrench , find the metal water supply lines connecting the valve to your faucet. Secure your basin wrench around the nuts on the bottom of the faucet and turn them counterclockwise until they’re loose. Then finish unscrewing them by hand. [4] X Expert Source Patrick Johns Home Improvement Specialist Expert Interview. 5 April 2022. If the area under your sink isn’t too cramped, then you can use a regular crescent wrench. You can leave the other ends of the supply lines connected to the valves on your wall. Water supply lines may drip water once you disconnect them, so be sure to hold them over the towel and bucket. Wipe up any water that drips onto the bottom of the vanity immediately to prevent damage or warping."

      "content": "Unscrew the lock nuts and washers on your faucet by hand. Your faucet is attached with plastic lock nuts underneath your sink. Since the lock nuts are usually only hand-tight, try turning them counterclockwise to loosen them. If they feel stuck, then just grip them with your wrench to get better leverage. Once they’re loose, pull them off along with the rubber washers underneath them. [5] X Research source If you can’t reach the lock nuts, you can easily unscrew them with a basin wrench too. If your faucet nut is stuck or if you have any trouble turning it, try spraying it penetrating oil to cut through the rust. If that still doesn’t work, cut through the nut with a hacksaw .

If you see a plastic or rubber gasket still stuck on your sink, remove it as well. [7] X Research source You can usually recycle an old sink faucet or take it to a metal scrapyard. Contact your area’s recycling service and ask if they’ll accept your faucet. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Clean the faucet and drain holes with soapy water and a sponge. There may be some old buildup or sealant underneath your old faucet or where the drain sat in your sink. Wet the area with some soap and water and scrub the holes with a sponge or gentle abrasive pad. Once the area is clean, rinse it well, pat it dry, and let it air-dry completely. [9] X Research source Use a plastic putty knife to scrape off any stubborn residue on your sink. Avoid using metal putty knives since they could scratch your sink’s finish. Your new faucet will create a better waterproof seal if you install it on a clean surface."

      "content": "Choose a new faucet based on the mounting holes on your sink. Before you go to the home or hardware store for a new faucet, look at your basin hole configuration. Your basin will either have 1 or 3 mounting holes. Measure the distance between the holes so that you get the right replacement faucet. [10] X Expert Source Patrick Johns Home Improvement Specialist Expert Interview. 5 April 2022. You can also use the old faucet as a guide to the new faucet you purchase. Single hole faucets have a spout with a single attached handle. They only require 1 hole in your basin, but you can install them in a 3-hole basin if they have a large decorative escutcheon plate. [11] X Research source Center-set faucets have separate hot and cold handles, but they’re still attached to the main spout. These faucets work great if you have 3 holes in your basin that are close together. Widespread faucets come in 3 separate pieces and work best if the mounting holes are spaced far apart on your sink. Try to get a faucet that matches the finishes and other fixtures that you already have in your bathroom so the styles don’t clash. [12] X Research source"

Then, screw on the plastic lock nuts until they’re hand-tight. Check to make sure that the faucet is straight before giving the nuts a final half-turn with a wrench to tighten them down.

Then, just screw your P-trap back onto the end of the drain pipe to finish your drain assembly.

[19] X Research source To fix a leaky faucet handle, try replacing the faucet cartridge. If you see leaks dripping from pipe connections, turn off your water and ensure any plumber’s tape or rubber washers are working properly. Then tighten all the pipe connections and test the water again."
