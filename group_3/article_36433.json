      "content": "Wet a piece of 800-grit sandpaper. Run a piece of 800-grit sandpaper underneath warm water to get it damp. Shake any excess water off of the piece and wring it out so it doesn't drip. Set up your work station near a sink if possible so you can re-wet the sandpaper whenever you need to. [1] X Research source If you have a deep scratch on your plexiglass, then start with 600-grit sandpaper instead."

      "title": "Sand over the scratch in small circles for 1 minute.",
      "content": "Sand over the scratch in small circles for 1 minute. Apply light pressure to the scratches with your wet piece of sandpaper. Work in small, circular movements to buff the surface evenly. Sand any areas that are scratched for 1 minute, and wet the sandpaper again when it feels dry. [2] X Research source Your piece of plexiglass may start to look cloudy or frosted over, but it will not stay that way when you finish."

      "title": "Alternate between a dry and wet piece of sandpaper for the next 2 minutes.",
      "content": "Alternate between a dry and wet piece of sandpaper for the next 2 minutes. Switch to a dry piece of 800-grit sandpaper and go over the same areas. Keep working in small circles so the scratch is buffed completely. After about 30 seconds, switch back to using wet sandpaper. Change the sandpaper you're using every 30 seconds for the next 2 minutes. [3] X Research source Alternating between wet and dry sandpaper creates more abrasion and helps work through the scratches faster."

      "content": "Switch to working with wet and dry 1,200-grit sandpaper. Once you've worked with 800-grit sandpaper, switch to 1200-grit, which will help smooth your plexiglass even more. Start with a wet piece of sandpaper for 30 seconds and then switch to a dry piece. Keep alternating between wet and dry sandpaper for 3 minutes to buff the plexiglass. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Apply a thin layer of plexiglass polish to the area. The area with the scratches will look cloudy when you're finished buffing it with the sandpaper. Apply a coin-sized amount of plexiglass polish onto a clean cloth and work it into the glass in small circular motions. Keep buffing the polish for 30 seconds or until it turns clear on your surface. Wipe the polish off with a clean, dry cloth to remove the scratches. [5] X Research source You can buy plexiglass polish from your local hardware store. Plexiglass polish may also be called acrylic polish in stores."

Wring the cloth out so it isn't dripping wet when you use it. [7] X Research source Don't use a cloth that has an abrasive side since it will only add more scratches to your plexiglass.

Acrylic scratch removers, such as Novus or Turtle Wax, help polish your plexiglass and buff out any light scratches on its surface. Squeeze a dime-sized amount onto the damp cloth, and rub it into the cloth to spread it. If you have multiple scratches you need to remove, use a quarter-sized amount instead. [9] X Research source You can buy scratch remover in hardware and big box stores. You may also apply the scratch remover directly on the plexiglass if you want."

Evenly coat the scratch as much as you can to fill and blend it in with the rest of the plexiglass. Keep buffing the remover for at least 30 seconds or until it turns clear. [10] X Research source"

As soon you're done applying the scratch remover to the plexiglass, use a lint-free cleaning cloth to wipe any excess off. Work in small circles over the surface of your plexiglass. Once the scratch remover is off of your piece, you won't be able to see the scratches anymore. [11] X Research source Hold your plexiglass up to a light to see if there are any visible scratches. If there still is, then buff on another coat of scratch remover."

Keep the heat gun's nozzle at least 2 inches (5.1 cm) from the plexiglass so you don't accidentally cause it to melt or bubble. When you're ready to start, press the power button to start the machine. [13] X Research source Make sure the plexiglass is sitting on a heat-safe surface since the heat gun will make it very warm."

Use small back and forth strokes over the entire scratch until it starts to disappear. Try adjusting the angle of the heat gun to hit the scratch from all sides. After about 20-30 seconds of heating, light scratches will start to go away. [14] X Research source Using a heat gun does not work on deep scratches."
