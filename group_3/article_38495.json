      "content": "Clean up the room and lay down a soft cotton sheet. A messy room that’s full of junk just isn’t sensual. Take the time to declutter the room where you intend to give the foot massage , so neither of you are distracted by any clutter. [1] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Also take the extra step of putting clean sheets on the bed so she’s uber relaxed. Soft cotton sheets will feel good on her skin, and they make cleaning up any spilled lotion or body oil much easier."

      "content": "Turn down the lights, and consider using aromatherapy candles. Dimming the lights creates a more soothing and sensual atmosphere. Adding candles, especially ones that use her favorite scents , can turn the sensuality up another notch. It’s called aromatherapy, and it’s scientifically proven! [2] X Trustworthy Source Johns Hopkins Medicine Official resource database of the world-leading Johns Hopkins Hospital Go to source For instance, light some vanilla, cinnamon, rose, or lavender scented candles. Set them up around the room to create mood lighting. Just make sure there’s enough light to see what you’re doing, and don’t use more than 1 scent, which can be disorienting."

      "content": "Put on some calming music. Music goes a long way toward setting a mood. [3] X Research source While you might think that romantic music is the way to go here, instead go with soothing instrumental music or even nature sounds. This’ll help her become as calm and relaxed as possible. There’s a chance that this might help her to drift off to sleep, but rely on your massage skills to keep her awake and interested in you!"

      "content": "Make sure your hands are warm before you touch her feet. Cold hands aren’t very relaxing when it comes to giving a massage. [4] X Research source Plus, she definitely won’t find the feel of cold hands on her feet seductive! Take 10-15 seconds to rub your hands together vigorously, hold them under warm water for 60 seconds, or breathe on them to warm them up before starting the massage. Even better, wrap your hands in a warm towel for 1-2 minutes before starting the massage."

      "title": "Grab some lotion or body oil to ramp up the sensuality.",
      "content": "Grab some lotion or body oil to ramp up the sensuality. Lotions and body oils reduce friction and enhance the sensation of the massage. Choose a lotion or oil intended for massages, and consider scented options. Squeeze a few drops into your hands and rub them together. [5] X Research source Consider warming the oil or lotion beforehand by holding the bottle in your hands for 2 or 3 minutes. Alternatively, buy a plug-in lotion warmer from a beauty supply store. Don’t use the microwave to heat up lotion or oil—you’ll end up with hot spots that can burn!"

      "title": "Ask her if she’d like a foot massage.",
      "content": "Ask her if she’d like a foot massage. Once you’ve set the scene, make your first move! When the mood is right and you find a good moment, ask her if you could massage her feet. Say something like, “I give a pretty amazing foot massage, you know,” or, “Can I massage your feet? I’d love to do something nice for you, if you’re comfortable with that.” If she does say yes, keep in mind that it’s not automatically a pass to get sexual, just to massage her. You need consent to move further! Most people will get the message, but it’s also important to go slow and get consent whenever you touch someone’s body."

      "content": "Massage one foot at a time for maximum relaxation. This lets you focus on one area with both hands, making for quite the experience. While focusing your attention on one of her feet, place the other on the soft cotton sheet, on a pillow, or in a warm water soak. [6] X Research source Once you’ve completed the full massage routine on one foot, repeat the exact same process on the other foot. Use the muscles in your hands, arms and shoulders to apply the massage, not just those in your thumbs. Otherwise, your thumbs will cramp up and ruin the mood! Ask her if one foot is particularly sore or tight, and start with that one."

Then, move back down the same foot, using firm pressure with your thumbs while cupping her foot in your hands. [7] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Medical School Harvard Medical School's Educational Site for the Public Go to source Work your way up and down her foot 2 or 3 times. Rub in small circles, and be careful not to use too much pressure. If she's reclining on a sofa or bed, sit in a chair at her feet. If you're using a massage table, stand up. Hold her foot so that it’s close to your chest—this helps control the amount of pressure you apply."

      "content": "Massage the arch of her foot with your thumbs. Apply light pressure to the arch, rotating one thumb clockwise and the other one counterclockwise. Continue doing this for 30 seconds or longer. The sole is an important component in foot reflexology, which is the practice of using pressure points to reduce stress and pain, so pay extra attention to it. [8] X Trustworthy Source Science Direct Online archive of peer-reviewed research on scientific, technical and medical topics Go to source Cup her foot with light pressure as you massage the arch with your thumbs. If you grab or rub too lightly, though, the massage is more likely to feel ticklish. Ask her if the pressure you're applying feels good, and check for other feedback (like \"oohs\" and \"ahhs\") that indicate you're doing it right."

      "content": "Rub her heel and Achilles tendon. With her foot still cupped in your hands, slide your thumbs up and down the Achilles tendon, which runs from the heel to the lower calf. Then, use your thumbs to rub her heel in opposing circular motions. Fuller says to also massage the calf, which helps relax the foot. If the skin on her heel is dry, apply additional lotion or oil to your hands to reduce friction and discomfort."

Slide your finger down the inside of the big toe to the base, then come back up the inside of the second toe. Repeat this move 2 or 3 more times, then move on to the second and third toes.

[11] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Medical School Harvard Medical School's Educational Site for the Public Go to source Fuller also recommends lightly digging your knuckles into the sole. Move on to massaging the other foot now that you’ve finished the first one. However, if she requests some additional work on the first foot, be sure to say “yes!”"

      "content": "Let her know you enjoy giving her a foot massage. Massages are a natural and positive way to connect to a partner, so let her know you enjoy it! [12] X Research source Make small murmurs (a deep, quietly whispered \"mmmm\" works beautifully) and widen your smile to a grin at intervals, to show her that you're fully appreciating every interaction with her body. Instead of acting like you’re in a rush to get to what you hope will happen after the massage, focus on enjoying what you’re doing now and build up anticipation for the next step."

[13] X Research source Assuming she says yes, try gently kissing her feet a few times. After 20-30 seconds or so, look up and ask, \"How are you enjoying it now?\" Remember that consent is key! Don’t kiss her at all without asking. It’s also super sexy to say something like, “Can I kiss your feet? I just can’t help myself.” If she isn’t into the foot kissing and seems ready for the massage to end, take the cue and stop trying to seduce her for now. But don’t worry, your efforts may pay dividends at another time!"

Simply saying, \"Can I massage the rest of you?\" might just work wonders on its own.

This is usually a strong signal that she wants to go further than just a massage, so you should definitely agree. Don't blurt out \"heck yeah!\" or mutter \"I guess,\" though. Instead, say \"sure\" or \"yes I would\" in your seductive voice! Sometimes a massage is just a massage, however, so don't assume too much. Just enjoy the massage and, if anything beyond that happens, think of it as the icing on the cake!"
