      "content": "Take oral decongestants. Talk to your doctor before taking over-the-counter products if you have existing medical conditions, such as hypertension, diabetes, and glaucoma. Products like these can be helpful, but they don’t work for everyone. Oral decongestants contain the active ingredients phenylephrine and pseudoephedrine. The more common side effects caused by these products include nervousness, dizziness, feeling that your heart rate is increased, slight elevations in blood pressure, and sleep problems. [4] X Trustworthy Source FamilyDoctor.org Family-focused medical advice site run by the American Academy of Family Doctors Go to source Oral decongestants work by narrowing blood vessels in the nasal passages, helping the swollen tissues to shrink. This improves the flow of mucus to reduce the pressure and the flow of air so you can breathe easier. [5] X Trustworthy Source FamilyDoctor.org Family-focused medical advice site run by the American Academy of Family Doctors Go to source Products that contain pseudoephedrine, originally marketed as Sudafed®, can be purchased without a prescription but are kept behind the pharmacy counter due to concerns about inappropriate use.

While these products can help to clear sinus passages and relieve the pressure quickly, using them for more than 3 days results in a rebound effect. [8] X Trustworthy Source FamilyDoctor.org Family-focused medical advice site run by the American Academy of Family Doctors Go to source A rebound effect means that your body adjusts to the medications being used, and the congestion and pressure returns, or is possibly worse than before, when you try to stop using them.

They may help relieve inflammation, swelling, and other symptoms of sinusitis. However, because they can interact with certain medications, you should always consult with your doctor before starting these or any other herbal treatment to ensure that they are safe for you. Bromelain may increase your risk of bleeding, so people who take blood-thinning drugs may not be able to use it. Bromelain can cause a larger drop in blood pressure when used with ACE inhibitors.
