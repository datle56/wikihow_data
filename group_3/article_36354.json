Because mold spores spread easily, protect yourself and the rest of your home by wearing PPE (personal protective equipment), such as an N95 mask , long rubber gloves, protective goggles, and if possible, a full body protective suit . Remove any furniture you want to protect and tape plastic sheeting to the floor. Open a window to ventilate the room, and seal any doors that lead to other parts of the house. [1] X Trustworthy Source United States Environmental Protection Agency Independent U.S. government agency responsible for promoting safe environmental practices Go to source Because you’ll likely need to work with strong chemicals to remove mold, it’s important to work in a well-ventilated area. Paint can act as a protective layer which keeps the mold from getting on the drywall itself. If you catch it early, it’s usually possible to remove it with cleaning solutions rather than having to replace the drywall itself."

      "content": "Spray the drywall with a mold-killing solution of your choice. There are several different cleaning agents that kill mold , though some are stronger than others. Pour your preferred solution into a spray bottle and lightly spray it on the mold. Be careful not to drench the area, as too much moisture can make the mold worse. Here are some effective mold-killing solutions you can try: [2] X Research source Bleach: Mix 1 part bleach with 3 parts water for an effective mold-killing solution. Do not mix bleach with any other chemicals, and work in a well-ventilated area so you don’t breathe in the strong fumes. Baking soda: Combine 1 part baking soda with 5 parts water for a mild cleaning solution. This is the safest mold cleaner, so it’s a good option if you have pets or children. Vinegar : Use straight vinegar or mix it with water in equal parts. This method is a bit stronger than baking soda but is still natural and safe to use around children and pets. It does have a strong scent, however. Commercial mold cleaners : Commercial mold and mildew cleaners, like Concrobium Mold Control , are designed to effectively eliminate mold and musty odors. They also help prevent regrowth by creating a protective barrier. Commercial mold cleaners are strong chemicals, however, and shouldn’t be used around children or pets. Unscented detergent: Combine unscented detergent with a small amount of water for a safer chemical option. Using an unscented detergent means you’ll still be able to detect the smell of mold without interference. Whatever solution you choose, Chiu says to “do a test spot treatment in an inconspicuous spot” to make sure it won’t damage the paint.

Point a fan at the wall and let it run for as long as necessary until the sheetrock is completely dry. While you wait, dispose of any materials used to clean the spot and disinfect reusable tools. Once the wall is dry, repaint it with a stain-blocking paint if any discoloration remains.

      "content": "Discoloration and stains Mold typically appears on drywall as discoloration and black, gray, green, yellow, or brown dots or clusters. Water stains also indicate moisture issues that can lead to mold growth. Here are a few common types of mold and where they’re likely to be found: [6] X Research source Black mold : Black mold is often found in houses and on surfaces with excessive moisture damage. It can potentially produce mycotoxins that can harm people and pets if left untreated for a long period of time. Blue mold: Blue mold has a bluish-green color and is often found in drywall, wallpaper, ceilings , and insulation that has been damaged by water. It requires little moisture to develop. White mold : White mold often grows in cool, damp environments, like basements . Green mold: Green mold is often found in dark, damp areas and is known to grow in bathrooms and dark corners. Kapur says, “There's different types of mold, but they come in a million different colors—black is just one that people are afraid of. It comes in white, gray, [and] beige. Usually, you can identify it on a cleaner piece of surface where you see little spots [of those colors].” [7] X Expert Source Mike Kapur Certified Mold Assessor & Home Inspector, Sonic Home Inspections Expert Interview. 19 August 2020."

Seal the room from the rest of the house and cover the floor and surrounding area with a plastic sheet. [10] X Research source Try to work in a well-ventilated area by opening windows and doors. Consider using a HEPA air filtration system to capture airborne mold spores. In most cases, if the mold is on the drywall itself, it won’t be enough just to clean the area. It’s better to replace the affected drywall altogether, as the mold has likely spread to the back of the drywall, as well."

      "content": "Find a stud and cut a square around the moldy area. Use a stud finder to locate the studs around the moldy area, then mark their location with a pencil so you know where to place the screws when you replace the drywall. Then, use a utility knife to cut out a square of the moldy drywall—this square should be 5-6 inches (12-15 cm) larger than the stain itself and should extend over at least two wooden wall beams behind the drywall. [11] X Research source Removing more drywall than necessary will increase your odds of removing unseen mold spores and will make it possible to replace the section of drywall. If it helps, outline the sections you plan to remove with a pencil, then saw along the lines with your knife. Point it out and away from you as you work. When the patch of drywall comes free, carefully remove it and set it down, mold-side up, on the plastic sheet. Do not use a saw to remove the drywall, as they can agitate the mold and can be dangerous if used near an outlet."

Then, clean the surrounding area with a mold-killing solution of your choice (bleach, vinegar, or a commercial mold remover) and treat the area with a mold and mildew primer like Kilz to prevent future growth. Let the area dry completely before moving on to the next step. [12] X Research source If you fit a new piece of drywall when the area is still damp, more mold may grow from the moisture. If the moldy area is by a door or window, have someone spray water on the door or window with a hose while the inner wall is open. This will help you locate leaks so you can seal them and prevent future mold growth. If there is a lot of hidden mold or the mold is growing on wood, it’s better to hire a professional to inspect the whole area."

[13] X Research source If the drywall you removed didn’t come off in one piece, use a tape measure to measure the hole in the wall and cut the new piece of drywall to those exact measurements.

Here are some other reasons to consider hiring a professional: [21] X Research source You suspect there’s mold hidden in wall cavities or HVAC systems The building has a history of flooding or extensive water damage You or your family experience mold-related health issues The mold keeps returning after DIY removal attempts Be aware that mold remediation can cost $5,000 on average depending on the extent of the damage.
