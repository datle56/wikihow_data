      "content": "Know the difference between shyness, social anxiety, and awkwardness. People often use these three terms interchangeably, but they are actually very different. Shyness and anxiety can both cause you to feel awkward, but you can also be socially awkward without being shy or suffering from social anxiety. [1] X Research source Shyness is simply an uneasiness around other people. People who are shy may feel uncomfortable in certain social situations, but this usually does not interfere with their daily lives much. If you are shy, you may be able to get past it simply by challenging yourself to partake in social situations that make you uncomfortable. Social anxiety may resemble extreme shyness. People who suffer from social anxiety typically have unreasonable fears of embarrassing themselves in social situations, which interfere with their ability to function in society. If you suffer from social anxiety, a professional mental health expert can help you overcome your condition. Awkwardness, or being self-conscious, is the feeling that everyone is watching you, sometimes leading to embarrassment. It can happen to anyone, but this feeling peaks during the teenage years.

      "content": "Practice self-acceptance to build confidence. When you're confident, that insidious feeling of self-consciousness tends to fade into the background. Instead of worrying about what other people are thinking, you're able to focus on enjoying the experience. Building confidence doesn't happen overnight, but you can gradually achieving it by learning how to accept yourself. When you have negative thoughts about yourself, try seeing them in a different way. For example, let's say you're feeling shy in a given situation. Instead of berating yourself, look at it from a different angle: you're feeling quiet today, and there's nothing wrong with that. There's room for quiet people in the world, just like there is room for outgoing people. Realize that you're great just as you are. You are a person worth knowing, even if you have imperfections - after all, everyone on earth has them. Sometimes things may be awkward, but it doesn't have to be the end of the world.

Anything that interests you and that will give you the opportunity to interact with new people (even just a few) will be good for you if you are trying to overcome shyness or social anxiety. [4] X Research source Consider taking some kind of small group class to learn a new skill, such as painting or kickboxing. You could also join a sports team or a social group that gets together to do activities."

      "content": "Give up your safety behaviors. A lot of people who are shy or socially anxious have certain behaviors that they use to shield them from the awkwardness of social interaction. This may be looking at your phone or avoiding eye contact with people at parties, or it may be drinking alcohol or doing drugs to feel less awkward. If you really want to get past your awkwardness, you need to identify these kinds of behaviors and give them up. The more you experience social interactions without your safety behaviors, they easier it will become. [5] X Research source"

If you find yourself obsessing about all of the bad or embarrassing things that might happen during your next social interaction, you need to start actively challenging these thoughts. The next time a thought like this enters your mind, ask yourself how likely it really is to happen. Then think of several reasons why the bad thing is unlikely to happen and keep repeating them to yourself. [6] X Research source For example, if you are worried that you will say something stupid if you try to talk to a girl you like, tell yourself that is not true because you are intelligent, you have lots of interesting things to talk about, and you have already made a plan for what you will talk to her about. Try to understand that even though you feel really awkward and uncomfortable, it doesn't mean that the person you're talking to is feeling the same way.

If this is the case for you, the best thing you can do is get as much practice as possible. The more experience you have talking with different people about different topics in different settings, the better you will get at picking up on social cues. [8] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source In order to really overcome your fears, you need to talk to people you don't know instead of gluing yourself to your friends' sides at a party. It may help you feel more confident if you know who will be at a particular event ahead of time. This is especially helpful for business networking. Find out as much as you can about these people before you meet them so you will know what to talk about."

It's always easier to have a good conversation when the topic genuinely interests you. Current events are always good conversation starters, so get to know what's going on in the world.

Try to remember that these pauses tend to feel much longer than they actually are, so don't let them completely kill your conversation. Don't overthink things and just keep talking. Even if you completely change the subject, at least the conversation will continue. If you can't think of anything else to say, start talking about something in your shared environment, such as the weather conditions or the food at the party you both happen to be at. Start with something simple like, \"What do you think about this weather we've been having?\" to get started. [17] X Research source Keep in mind the silences don't always need to be awkward. Try not to let it throw you off your game and ask a question, even if several seconds have passed. For example, if the person you were talking to was telling you about his vacation to Prague, consider jumping back into that conversation a moment later by saying something like, \"So you've been to Prague. Have you traveled anywhere else in Europe?\""
