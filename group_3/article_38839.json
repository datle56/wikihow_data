      "content": "Make your own well-being a priority. Many people fail to set personal boundaries because they feel guilty about it or think their needs don’t matter. However, your needs are just as important as anyone else’s, and you have to be in good mental and emotional health to be able to help others and fulfill your own responsibilities. Setting boundaries you’re comfortable with isn’t selfishness – it’s your right. [1] X Research source In the long run, healthy boundaries don’t only benefit you. They also benefit your loved one with BPD by creating a clear sense of structure and predictability in the relationship."

      "title": "Define your boundaries.",
      "content": "Define your boundaries. Determine ahead of time which limits you are going to establish with your loved one and why. One good way to define your boundaries is to think about your values. Good boundaries are a way of protecting the things that matter to you most and ensuring you aren’t pressured into activities or situations that go against the way you want to live. [2] X Research source For instance, if your friend wants to talk on the phone with you every night, but you value spending evenings with your family, you might decide not to take your friend’s calls after five o’clock."

      "content": "Decide on follow-up steps when your boundaries are crossed. It's important to think about what action you will take if your loved one does not respect your boundaries. If you don’t specify what your reactions will be and follow through with them, your loved one will probably not take your boundaries seriously. A good follow-up step should be something that follows naturally from the other person’s actions. [3] X Research source For instance, you might decide that if your partner shouts at you again, you will leave the house for a few hours until they can calm down."

      "content": "Prepare yourself for your loved one’s reactions to your boundaries. The other person may be angry, hurt, or embarrassed when you tell them you need them to behave differently. They may take the change personally, accuse you of not loving them, or act out against the boundaries. Decide how you will handle various reactions so you aren’t caught off guard when it happens.

      "content": "Choose a time when you and your loved one are calm. Talking about boundaries can be a touchy subject. Make the conversation a little easier by talking with the other person at a time when you’re both emotionally stable. Avoid introducing the topic of boundaries during or right after a fight.

      "content": "State your boundaries clearly and firmly. Be upfront when you tell your loved one about your new boundaries. Be kind, but don’t apologize or back down.

      "content": "Explain why you are setting these boundaries. For your loved one, hearing about the new limits you’re imposing on the relationship might sting. However, it’s important that they understand why you’re doing it. Be gentle but honest about your reasons. [6] X Trustworthy Source HelpGuide Nonprofit organization dedicated to providing free, evidence-based mental health and wellness resources.

For instance, if you find your spouse’s mood swings exhausting to deal with, you could say, “It’s really wearing me out trying to guess how you’ll be feeling from one day to the next. I need you to communicate your feelings to me more regularly.”"

      "content": "Reassure your loved one that you value them. Someone with BPD may feel insulted when others set boundaries with them. Make sure to give your loved one plenty of reassurance that you’re not rejecting them as a person and that your relationship with them is still important to you. [7] X Research source Emphasize the ways your boundary will benefit both of you. This will help your loved one understand that you’re not setting limits just to try to push them away. For instance, you could tell a friend, “I think spending more time on our own will be good for both of us in the long run. I have more energy for socializing when I spend enough time alone, so we’ll both have more fun when we do get together.”"

Knowing what’s normal and what’s not for a person with BPD can help you decide what boundaries are fair for both of you. For instance, it may upset you when your partner experiences stress-related paranoia, and you may be tempted to set a boundary like, “Don’t approach me with your concerns when they’re unfounded.” The problem with this might is that this paranoia is probably a symptom of BPD that your partner can’t help, and rejecting them when they need you will hurt both of you in the long run. Instead, try saying, “Let me know when you’re experiencing intense paranoia. We’ll talk it over for a few minutes, then I’ll sit close by in the next room while you calm down.” Other symptoms include a fear of abandonment, unstable relationships, changes in self-image, impulsive behavior, suicidal behavior, mood swings, and feelings of anger or emptiness.
