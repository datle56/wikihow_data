      "content": "Use this checklist as you pack your school bag. While the exact items you need may vary from day to day, always pack essentials like writing utensils and school supplies. Then, add extra items from the list like mints and hair ties. Even if you don’t need them every day, it’s good to have them just in case. If your school has lockers or you live in a college dorm, you can store some things there until you need them.

      "content": "Pack any books and binders you need to take to school first. Packing these heavy items first will keep them from squashing any lighter items. Arrange any books and binders vertically in your backpack against the part that touches your back, or horizontally if you have any other type of bag. [1] X Research source Pack your bag the night before each school day so you’re not scrambling in the morning, says academic counseling expert Alicia Oglesby. If you don't need a certain book or binder, leave it at home so your load is lighter—or take it to school and store it in your locker."

      "content": "Add your planner, notebooks, folders, and homework next. If you have loose papers, like homework or notes, it’s best to store them in a binder or folder so they don’t get wrinkled or ripped. Include your planner as well so that you can make notes on homework, upcoming exams, and other important dates. Stack these items next to your books, making sure to distribute the weight evenly throughout the backpack or bag. [2] X Research source ”Use a handwritten planner to record your assignments and any other commitments or after school activities you have,” advises professional school counselor Katie Styzek. This will help you stay organized, even when life gets busy."

      "content": "Put a reusable water bottle in an external pocket. It’s important to stay hydrated as you go through your day, and you might not always have access to a water fountain. Bring an empty reusable water bottle to school and fill it when you arrive. Store it in an external pocket of your backpack or carry it by the handle so it doesn’t leak on your things.

      "title": "Include your wallet, student ID, and keys.",
      "content": "Include your wallet, student ID, and keys. Pack essential personal items like your wallet, student ID, and car keys or house key (if you use them). Place these in the small, zippered pockets of your bag to help keep things organized. Double-check that your school ID is in your wallet before you pack it. Keep some emergency cash in your wallet in case you forget to bring lunch. You don’t need a large amount—someone could steal it. $10 to $20 should suffice."

      "title": "Bring electronics and chargers if allowed.",
      "content": "Bring electronics and chargers if allowed. Not every school lets you use electronics. Still, pack your phone so you can use it to text friends and parents during passing periods, lunch, and before and after school. If you’re allowed to take notes electronically or require a computer for certain classes, pack a laptop or tablet. Don’t forget to bring chargers for all your devices. If your school allows you to listen to music, pack your earbuds or headphones. Place them in their own pocket so they don’t get crushed by heavier items. Follow all rules regarding electronics for your school; keep them off or on silent mode and in your bag or locker during classes."

      "content": "Fill a small bag with health and beauty items you might need. Pack a small zippered toiletry bag with beauty and health items you may need throughout the day. Examples include chapstick, extra hair ties, Advil, and band-aids. Always pack period supplies like tampons or pads, personal wipes , and a spare pair of underwear.

      "content": "Add items for electives or extracurricular activities. Depending on your schedule, you may need gym clothes in addition to a sports uniform or equipment (like soccer cleats or football pads). If they fit, you can store these items in your backpack so you don’t have to carry two bags. [7] X Research source Though an instrument isn’t likely to fit in your school bag, set the case near your bag so you don’t forget it! The same goes for a helmet if you ride a bike, skateboard, or scooter to school."

      "content": "Add extra items like snacks and gum if desired. While not essential, some items are nice to have if you can fit them in your backpack. For example, you may want to add a few small snacks, like a granola bar or bag of cut veggies, in case you get hungry. Another fun extra is chewing gum or mints—just check your school’s policies to see if gum is allowed. If you get cold easily, pack a light jacket or hoodie. Alternatively, store an extra jacket in your locker. Your extras may change depending on the season. In summer and spring, you’ll likely need sunglasses and sunscreen. In the winter, a hat and gloves may be essential."
