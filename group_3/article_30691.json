      "title": "Dry ingredients",
      "content": "Dry ingredients Tilt the container of your dry ingredient and stick the tablespoon inside, lifting up enough of the ingredient so the spoon is overflowing. Then, use the blunt edge of a butter knife (or another flat item, like a chopstick), to level off the overflowing ingredient. [7] X Research source Use this process when measuring dry ingredients with any type of measuring cup. Alternative: Use a kitchen scale to get the most accurate measurements for your dry ingredients."

      "content": "Measuring your ingredients by weight allows you to be more accurate. Dry ingredients are measured in weight rather than volume—in other words, 1 tablespoon of flour doesn’t weigh the same as 1 tablespoon of sugar, which doesn’t weigh the same as 1 tablespoon of brown sugar, and so on and so forth. Using a kitchen scale to measure the precise weight of your ingredients helps you capture the ratio of ingredients needed for your recipes—and to help you out, we’ve created a cheat sheet with the weights (in grams) for common dry ingredients."
