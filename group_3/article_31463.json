      "content": "O7 is a visualization of a person saluting. The “O” is supposed to resemble a head. The “7” is meant to look like someone’s arm raised up with their elbow and hand bent toward their forehead. When combined, it looks like a little soldier standing at attention in a salute. [1] X Research source O7 is an example of an emoticon , a precursor to emojis where internet users combine typographical symbols to make pictures of faces or animals. The most infamous emoticon is probably the :) smiley face. People will often use a lowercase o instead of O for the head, but o7 and O7 mean the same thing. Alternative: O> is a less common variation that also looks like a person saluting. You won’t see this as often as O7, though."
