      "title": "Spray the interior of the measuring cup with a non-stick cooking spray.",
      "content": "Spray the interior of the measuring cup with a non-stick cooking spray. Use measuring cups that you would normally use for dry ingredients. Select a measuring cup that corresponds to the amount of peanut butter you need. Spraying the inside of the measuring cup will prevent the peanut butter from sticking to the inside of the cup. You can also use cooking oil or melted butter as an alternative to cooking spray. Peanut butter that gets stuck to your kitchen tools will reduce the amount of peanut butter you’re using in your dishes."

      "title": "Spray the spatula or spoon that you’re using to scoop the peanut butter.",
      "content": "Spray the spatula or spoon that you’re using to scoop the peanut butter. Similar to your measuring cup, peanut butter that gets stuck to your kitchen tools will throw off your recipes. Spraying the spatula or spoon will make it slippery and prevent peanut butter from getting stuck on it. You can also use oil or melted butter for your spoon or spatula."

      "content": "Fill the measuring cup with peanut butter. Level off the top of the peanut butter so that it runs flush with the edges of the measuring cup. You should now be able to easily incorporate it into your recipe without a lot of waste. [1] X Research source If you don’t level the top of the peanut butter, your measurement will be inaccurate."

The tare button will zero out the scale so that you can weigh the peanut butter minus the weight of the measuring cup. [3] X Research source If your scale doesn’t have a tare button, you’ll have to subtract the weight of your measuring cup from the overall weight to get the weight of the peanut butter."

If you fill up a container with water first, you can measure the amount of peanut butter without having to level it out. Fill up a measuring cup made for liquids with 2-cups (473.1 ml) of water.

Once the water rises to the 3-cups (709.7 ml) mark, you’ll have 1-cup (236.58 mg) of peanut butter. Continue to scoop the peanut butter into the measuring cup until you have the amount you need.
