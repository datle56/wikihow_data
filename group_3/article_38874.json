      "content": "Determine whether your motherboard supports dual monitors. Virtually all modern computers' motherboards support multiple monitors, but older machines may not. While some computers may support at least one additional monitor, they may limit how many monitors you can have connected at once. You can check your motherboard for dual monitor support by doing the following: Find your motherboard's name . Look up your motherboard's name in a search engine (e.g., Google). Select a search result that lists your motherboard's features. Look for a \"Multi-Display,\" \"Multi-Monitor,\" or \"Dual Display\" feature."

      "title": "Determine your computer's video connection type.",
      "content": "Determine your computer's video connection type. Most newer computer graphics cards have at least two video-out ports that allow you to connect multiple monitors . These are usually connected to the graphics card on the back of the computer case. Many laptops have an HDMI port or DisplayPort on them. These may be on the side or back of the laptop. If your computer does not have a dedicated video-out port for a second monitor, check if it has a USB-C/Thunderbolt or USB 3.0 port. The following is a description of the different video connection types. HDMI : HDMI ports are small and thin, rectangular-shaped ports with the bottom corners rounded inward. Some smaller laptops may use a mini-HDMI or micro-HDMI connection. These ports are about the same shape as a regular HDMI cable but much smaller. HDMI is the standard for most newer monitors. It is used on most computer monitors and televisions. HDMI supports up to 4K resolution and high dynamic range color (HDR). While HDMI is the standard, there are different kinds. HDMI 1.4 can support 4K at 30 frames-per-second (fps) or HD (1080p) at 120 frames-per-second. HDMI 2.0 can support 4K at 60 frames per second. HDMI 2.1 can support up to 10k and 4K at 120 frames-per-second and higher resolutions. [1] X Research source DisplayPort: DisplayPort output ports are thin and rectangular-shaped with the bottom-right corner cut. Some laptops may use a mini-DisplayPort connection, which is the same shape as a DisplayPort but smaller. DisplayPort is a newer display connection mostly used with computer monitors rather than televisions. DisplayPort supports AMD's FreeSync and Nvidia's G-Sync. DisplayPort 1.2 can support 4K at 60 frames per second. DisplayPort 1.3 can support 4K at 120 frames per second. DisplayPort 1.4 can support 8K at 60 frames-per-second and HDR. DisplayPort 2.0 supports up to 16K at 60 frames per second. A DisplayPort connection can support multiple monitors connected from a single DisplayPort connection. USB-C/Thunderbolt 3 : A USB-C port has a small, pill-shaped port. Thunderbolt 3 ports have the same shape as a USB-C port and support a USB-C connection, but they will generally have an icon that resembles a lightning bolt next to them. USB 3.0 ports generally have a USB Type-A port, which is rectangular-shaped. You can connect a USB 3.0 port to an HD monitor using a USB-to-HDMI adapter. USB-C outputs can connect to a monitor and display up to 4K at 60 frames per second. Thunderbolt 3 connections support even higher display resolutions. However, not all monitors have a USB-C connection. If the monitor does not have a USB-C connection, you can connect it to a computer using a USB-C-to-HDMI or USB-C-to-DisplayPort adapter. [2] X Research source VGA: VGA ports are usually blue and rectangular with 15 holes. They usually have screw holes on the side used to secure the VGA cable. VGA is used on old computers. Most newer monitors do not support a VGA connection. However, you can connect a VGA to a newer monitor using an HDMI-to-VGA adapter. DVI: DVI ports are usually white with 24 holes. They also have a slot with four additional holes to the right. Like VGA ports, they often have screw holes on the sides to secure the DVI cable. DVI is another legacy video connection mostly used on older computers and monitors. It supports a higher resolution than VGA, but it does not support modern HD or 4K displays. Like VGA, most newer monitors do not support DVI, but you can connect a DVI connection to a newer monitor using a DVI-to-HDMI adapter."

      "content": "Check the second monitor's connection type. Your second monitor should have at least one of the previously mentioned connection types. If the monitor's connection differs from your computer's, you may need to purchase an adapter to connect the cable to your monitor. For example, if your computer has a DVI connection and your monitor uses an HDMI connection, you will need to use a DVI-to-HDMI adapter. Likewise, if you need a USB-C cable to connect a monitor, but the monitor does not have a USB-C input, you will need to get a USB-C-to-HDMI or USB-C-to-DisplayPort adapter. Some monitors may have a different port type than what your computer has. Make sure the cable you purchase has connectors that match the ports on the computer and monitor. For example, if your computer has a mini-HDMI port and your monitor has a regular HDMI port, you will need to get a mini-HDMI-to-HDMI cable."

If you need an adapter to connect your cable, connect the adapter to your computer. Then, plug an HDMI or DisplayPort cable into the adapter and connect the other end of the cable to the monitor. On some computers that have a USB-C/Thunderbolt 3 port, you may be able to connect multiple monitors to a single port using a USB-C/Thunderbolt dock. Just be aware that some laptops (Macbooks with a single USB-C/Thunderbolt port) may not support multiple displays connected to a single port. [3] X Research source"
