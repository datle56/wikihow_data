      "title": "Shein's affiliate program allows you to post their products for commission.",
      "content": "Shein's affiliate program allows you to post their products for commission. The Shein affiliate program (also known as the publisher program) works the way most affiliate marketing does; the affiliate receives a referral link to post when they share Shein products on their social media and when a customer buys something via that link, the affiliate gets a commission. Shein affiliates can select which products and promotions they want to market. [1] X Research source In addition to receiving 10-20% commission on purchases, Shein affiliates also receive monthly cash bonuses and coupons. Shein affiliates promote a variety of products including women’s and men’s clothing, accessories, and even home decor. Shein has previously offered the SHEGLAM influencer program for makeup artists and beauty influencers, but they are no longer taking applications. Affiliate marketing is not the same as influencer marketing. Marketing expert Christine Carter says, “For every sale that can be attributed to the individual marketing the product or service (or the affiliate), the company agrees to compensate the affiliate at an agreed upon percentage of the sale. It is different from influencer marketing because the marketer earns a commission, which is not always certain for influencer marketing agreements.”"

      "content": "College students can join the Campus Ambassador affiliate program. Much of this program works the same way as the regular affiliate program; ambassadors receive a referral link to post with their social media content and get commission when customers use it.

To join the Campus Ambassador program, you must be a current United States college or university student."

      "title": "Have an established social media platform.",
      "content": "Have an established social media platform. Because you’ll be posting your affiliate link on social media, you want to have a good-sized following on at least one platform so more people are likely to click the link and get you a commission. Make sure you regularly post engaging content and that your content is at least somewhat related to the types of products Shein offers. [2] X Research source You don’t have to post fashion content all the time, but your affiliate links should be appropriately targeted to your audience. If you post lifestyle content, you’re good to go, but if you only post content about mechanics, for example, it wouldn’t make sense to post ads for a fashion site. You don’t have to have a certain number of followers to apply for the affiliate program, but the bigger the audience, the more people who will click your referral link. If you post content on a website or blog rather than a platform like Instagram or TikTok , make sure it’s easy to navigate and aesthetically pleasing."
