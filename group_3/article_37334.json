There are three buttons. One button looks like a line, which is the \"Minimize\" button. This minimizes the window. The button on the far right (on a Mac) or in the middle (other computers) is the \"Restore Down/Maximize\" button, which makes your window a smaller size. It also maximizes your window. The last button is the \"X\" button, which closes your window."

      "content": "Resize the window. If you're on a Mac, go to the bottom right of your window. There should be a square with 3 diagonal lines in it under the scroll bar. Click and hold on it. Then, drag your mouse (side to side to make horizontal changes, up and down to make vertical changes, diagonal to change both at once) until your window is the desired size. To resize vertically on other computers, go to the top of the window (you will more than likely have to go to the very top, as if youâ€™re going past the window). When you get to the top, your cursor should show two arrows going in opposite directions. Click on the top of the window. Hold and drag the window down. Drag in the opposite direction if you want to make the window bigger again. To resize horizontally on other computers, move your mouse to right or left side of the window. Make sure the cursor is at the edge of the window. The cursor should change. It should have two arrows pointing at opposite directions. Click, hold, and drag the window inward. This will make it shorter. Do the opposite to make it large again."
