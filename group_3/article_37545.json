      "content": "Dip the roller in paint if it isn’t wet. Once you finish painting, dip it into your remaining supply of paint. Make sure it’s completely coated. To prevent things from getting too messy, shake off any dripping paint before attempting to wrap up the roller. [1] X Research source This storage method works only if you’re planning on reusing the roller right away. It’s great if you happen to be in the middle of a project. You can save a dirty roller for the next day instead of getting a new one. If you’re not planning on using the roller soon, wash it off instead. Cover it and put it in the closet."

      "title": "Wrap the roller in plastic wrap to keep the air out.",
      "content": "Wrap the roller in plastic wrap to keep the air out. Air exposure causes paint to dry. Secure the roller completely in the wrap, making sure there aren’t any gaps or holes in it. If you don’t have plastic wrap, use aluminum foil or a plastic Ziploc bag."

      "title": "Leave the roller out or store it in the refrigerator.",
      "content": "Leave the roller out or store it in the refrigerator. If you’re going to paint again in the next 24-48 hours, just set the roller on the counter or on top of your paint can. If you want to extend the life of the roller by more than 48 hours, you can try setting the roller in a fridge. The cold should slow the paint down and increase the drying time. [2] X Research source A lot of professional painters aren’t fond of the refrigerator option—they think it’s unnecessary and just leaves the fridge smelling like paint. It also may not be safe to leave fresh paint around food. [3] X Research source If you do refrigerate the roller, leave it out at room temperature for 2-3 hours before unwrapping it and using it again."

      "title": "Scrape all of the excess paint off of the roller.",
      "content": "Scrape all of the excess paint off of the roller. Professional painter Patrick Coye explains, “Try to get out as much paint as you possibly can. Use your five-in-one to scrape as much paint out of the roller as you can. Do one side holding it vertical, then flip it around and do the other side.” [4] X Expert Source Patrick Coye Painting Specialist Expert Interview. 22 July 2020. If you don’t have a 5-in-1 tool, just squeeze the roller out by hand. Wrap your fingers around the roller and squeeze down the entire length of the roller over and over again. Scrape the excess into a bucket or canister containing the rest of the unused paint. If you were using oil-based paint, just throw the roller out. You can theoretically wash an oil-based roller in solvents but it’s almost positively more effort than it’s worth."

Patrick Coye explains, “Once you get as much paint out of the roller as you can, wash it in water if you want to preserve it.” [5] X Expert Source Patrick Coye Painting Specialist Expert Interview. 22 July 2020. Just keep washing the roller while squeezing it over and over until the water runs completely clear. This can take 5-10 minutes of work. Rollers are designed to retain paint, so be patient! If you can’t get the paint out or you want to increase the speed of the process, soak the roller in soapy water before rinsing it. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Let the roller air dry before storing it.",
      "content": "Let the roller air dry before storing it. If you store a moist roller, it’s going to get moldy before you have an opportunity to use it again. Just leave the roller in the sink or outside and let it air dry for a few hours. Once it’s dry, toss it in a plastic bag to keep the dust off and store it for future use. [7] X Research source Don’t let the roller air dry over any surface you care about. Those rollers can hold a lot of moisture."

      "title": "You can probably get 3-5 uses out of a paint roller.",
      "content": "You can probably get 3-5 uses out of a paint roller. Unlike paint brushes—which you can reuse for up to a decade if you take care of them—the nap in paint rollers deteriorates with each cleaning. Once you’ve cleaned a roller a few times, it’s safer for your paint job if you toss the old roller and replace it. [8] X Research source You can tell a paint roller is at the end of its life if tiny pieces of the nap end up in your paint job. Once the nap is falling out, it’s no longer usable. If you’re reusing the roller in the short term (i.e. wrapping it in plastic for next-day use), you can get a few weeks out of a roller before it starts falling apart."

      "title": "If it’s a cheaper roller, just toss it and replace it.",
      "content": "If it’s a cheaper roller, just toss it and replace it. If you have a really nice roller that cost you a pretty penny and you like the way it performs, it’s worth cleaning it out to keep it for future use. If it’s a general paint roller though, just wrap it in a plastic bag and throw it in the trash. You can buy a 5- or 10-pack of rollers for the price of a Happy Meal, and cleaning degrades the quality of the roller anyway. If you have oil-based paint, don’t bother saving the roller. It’s a bit of a nightmare getting oil-based paint off. Professional painters replace rollers quite liberally, but they do take a ton of pride in caring for their brushes! Professional painter Patrick Coye says, “I have seen painters clean their brushes with laundry detergent to help soften the bristle. A good brush is worth saving.” [9] X Expert Source Patrick Coye Painting Specialist Expert Interview. 22 July 2020."
