The smaller drum, positioned on the right, is called the daylan (or tabla) and the larger drum, positioned on the left, is called the baylan. [2] X Research source Each drum makes a different tone but together they make the distinctive sound we associate with the tabla, a sound that is central to classical Indian music."

The daylan is made of wood, usually from a Neem or Shisham tree. The baylan is made out of metal or clay. [3] X Research source The two drums are made of different materials so that each has a distinct sound all its own. Both drums are covered with a goatskin drum heads. The drum heads are attached to the drum with long leather strips that attach to a leather ring at the bottom of the drum. In order to tune the drum, tabla makers insert wooden blocks between the drum body and the leather strips. Moving the wooden blocks up and down along the drum adjusts the tightness of the drum head and tone of the drum. An element that is unique to the tabla is the application of the sinai, a patch of iron fillings mixed with rice paste applied to the surface of the drum, right on the goat hide, which allows for further tuning of the drums.

The larger drum, on your left, should sit flat, with the top of the drum facing straight up. The face of the smaller drum, on your right, should be facing away from you, at approximately 35 degrees.
