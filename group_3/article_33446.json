Look at the top card in the discard pile and check your hand to see if you have a card you can play. If you have a card with a matching number, color, or symbol, you can play it onto the discard pile for your turn. You can only play one card per turn. [4] X Research source On the Light Side, the colors are blue, green, red, and yellow. On the Dark Side, the colors are pink, teal, orange, and purple. The numbers on the cards range from 1 to 9 in each color. You can play a Wild card no matter what the top card of the discard pile is. Always try to play a card from your hand if you can since you earn points for playing all of your cards."
