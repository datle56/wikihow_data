      "content": "Do some tests to determine the cause of the problem. Is the mouse acting funny due to settings, firmware, drivers, etc., or is the issue stemming from a broken spring, a bad USB port, or old batteries? First, replace the batteries if your mouse has batteries. Mice will start to malfunction as they get lower in power. Whether your mouse is wired or wireless, it probably has a USB cable or dongle. Many Bluetooth-enabled mice use a USB dongle to connect to the computer. Move it to another port on your computer to see if the issue is your USB port, cable, or dongle. Avoid using a USB hub and plug it directly into your computer. If the port on your computer isn't good, then you'll notice that your mouse behavior has improved. Try the mouse with another computer if you can. If it's a hardware issue, you'll continue to experience the right-clicking issue no matter what computer you're using."

      "content": "Clean your mouse if you suspect a hardware issue. Use a small tool like a toothpick to remove gunk and debris from small crevices; if your mouse has a trackball, remove it and clean each of the sensors gently. You can use a can of air or blow under the area that you click – there might be a wad of dust or a chip remnant stuck there that's preventing your mouse from clicking properly. Some users [1] X Research source have reported success by turning their mouse upside down and lightly tapping on the bottom to dislodge debris that was causing the right-click button to stick. If you have used the same mouse for a long time, the spring might have worn out; you'll need to repair it, but it's most likely easier to buy a new one."

To fix the mouse not right-clicking problem: Turn off your PC and unplug everything from it, including your USB mouse. (If you're on a Windows PC and can't use the mouse at all currently, try using the temporary fix to get your mouse working for now, or press Ctrl + Alt + Del and press Tab until the Power button is highlighted, then press Enter .) On a Mac or PC, you can also force a shutdown by holding the power button until your computer turns off. Turn on your computer again. After the computer turns on, plug everything in."

However, not all mice come with a firmware suite that keeps you updated (like Logi Options+). Older mice with fewer features most likely don't have to worry about firmware updates, but users with fancy mice should check their mouse's software or the manufacturer's website for those. Everyone, regardless of how fancy or not fancy your mouse is, must keep their drivers up-to-date . There are a few different ways that you can do this: Automatically for Windows and Mac: Most operating systems will automatically update drivers with a security update. For Windows, go to Settings > Update & Security (Win 10 only) > Windows Update > Check for updates . For Mac, go to System Settings > General > Software Update .
