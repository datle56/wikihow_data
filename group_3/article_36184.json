Your ingrown hair is solved, and you don’t need to do anything else. If you can’t see the small loop of hair, just leave the ingrown hair alone. Over time, the hair may rise to the surface, and you can try to lift it out with a needle."

      "content": "Consider laser treatment as a last resort. If you’re prone to ingrown hairs, shaving, waxing, and tweezing might not be great options for you. Instead, consider laser hair removal, a process that uses lasers to penetrate deep into the hair follicle and inhibits regrowth. [13] X Expert Source Heather Richmond, MD Board Certified Dermatologist Expert Interview. 15 September 2020. Laser hair removal can last for months or even years, and the hair that grows back usually isn’t as thick as it was before. Keep in mind, though, that laser hair removal usually isn’t covered by insurance since it’s considered a cosmetic procedure. [14] X Research source Depending on the area you get done, laser hair removal can cause blisters or darkening of the skin. Usually, laser hair removal is $350 to $400 per session. If your hair is very thick or you’re lasering a large area, you may need multiple sessions. Bear in mind that laser hair removal only works on dark hair—with white, blonde, or gray hair, there's no target for the laser energy.
