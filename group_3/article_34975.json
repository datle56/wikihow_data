      "content": "Help them move on with quotes like, \"The only way out is through.\" Richer says the best way to comfort someone is \"to validate their experience, and then offer something positive with that.\" This means you don't try to tell the person that their situation isn't that bad. This is especially important for someone going through a divorce or breakup. They feel raw and emotional, so trying to sugarcoat their situation won't help them feel better. Instead, affirm their experience while also cheering them up post-breakup with the quotes below. \"I am a marvelous housekeeper. Every time I leave a man, I keep his house.\" Zsa Zsa Gabor \"Before you marry a person, you should first make them use a computer with slow Internet to see who they really are.\" Will Ferrell \"Hardships often prepare ordinary people for an extraordinary destiny.\" C.S.

      "content": "Bring joy with a quote like, \"Tough times never last, but tough people do.\" As hard as it is to cheer up someone who's experiencing loss is to cheer up a person in physical pain . If someone in your life is sick or injured, avoid sending them generic lines like \"Cheer up!\" or \"Everything will be okay!\" Saying these things may make you feel better, but it probably won't help the other person. [4] X Research source Instead, use quotes like the ones below, which use metaphors and humor to find the light in a tough scenario. \"The Sun himself is weak when he first rises, and gathers strength and courage as the day gets on.\" Charles Dickens \"Tough times never last, but tough people do.\" Robert H. Schuller \"The best of healers is good cheer.\" Pindar \"There is one consolation in being sick; and that is the possibility that you may recover to a better state than you were ever in before.\" Henry David Thoreau \"Although the world is full of suffering, it's full also of the overcoming it.\" Helen Keller \"Be careful when reading health books; you may die of a misprint.\" Mark Twain \"You're in pretty good shape for the shape you are in.\" Dr. Seuss \"It's not the strength of the body that counts, but the strength of the spirit.\" J.R.R.

That actually doesn't feel encouraging.\" You can still offer encouragement, but acknowledge the other person's real, raw emotions, too. \"That's a really tough situation. But you're tough, too.
