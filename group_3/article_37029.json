      "content": "Turn off the water supply and empty the lines. The shutoff valves are usually located in the cabinet under the sink. Turn both the hot and cold valves clockwise until they resist further turning. Then, turn on the hot and cold faucet taps to empty the faucet lines. [1] X Research source If the shutoff valves won’t stop the flow of water completely, you’ll have to replace them. Unless you have some plumbing experience, this may be a job best left to a professional."

      "content": "Disconnect the P-trap portion of the drain pipe. If the P-trap is made of PVC, loosen the slip nut that connects it to the underside of the sink drain by hand. If the P-trap is made of metal, loosen the connecting nut with channel locks. [2] X Research source You don’t need to remove the P-trap to replace the sink, but you may want to remove it temporarily so you can clear it of debris. To take it out, unscrew the nut (by hand or with channel locks) that connects the bottom of the P-trap to the drain line below. Place a bucket or heavy towel at the bottom of the cabinet to catch any dripping water."

      "content": "Unfasten the hot and cold water lines with a crescent wrench. These are flexible lines that run from the shutoff valves to the underside of the faucet. Disconnect them right above the shutoff valves. Some types may have nuts you can loosen by hand, but you’ll often have to use a crescent wrench. [3] X Research source You can reuse these water lines if you want—just disconnect them from the underside of the sink later, then reattach them during installation. But this is also a good time to replace them."

If you want to reuse your existing countertop, makes sure you get a new sink that will fit in the same spot as the old one. Write down the length, depth, and width of the sink, as well as the length and width of the countertop. [4] X Research source You’ll likely have to replace the countertop as well if you want a new sink that’s a different size."

      "content": "Buy your new sink at a home improvement store. Bring the measurements of the old sink and countertop with you. This helps to ensure you purchase the correct size before putting in a bathroom sink. Make sure the replacement sink is the same type (top-mount or undermount) as the old one!

Make sure the new sink's drain lines up with your old drain line, or else you'll have to rework the plumbing. [6] X Expert Source Allen Lee Home Improvement Specialist Expert Interview. 10 July 2020. Most bathroom sinks are still made of ceramic, but there are other options, and many colors to choose from beyond the traditional white."

      "content": "Remove the clips under the sink that hold it against the countertop. Many, but not all, sinks have clips underneath them that create a pressure connection against the underside of the counter. If your sink has them, loosen them either by hand or with a screwdriver. [7] X Research source If your new sink requires clips, it should come with them. However, you may want to keep these old ones for the time being, just in case they might come in handy."

If you are not experienced with this type of project, you may be better off with a new faucet and drain, since they will come with detailed installation instructions. Faucet and drain installations will vary quite a bit based on the particular brand and model you select. However, with a good set of instructions, it is a project most DIYers can handle.

Either tighten them by hand or with a screwdriver, as indicated by the instructions. Once secured, they’ll apply pressure to hold the sink tight to the underside of the counter. [14] X Research source Not all sinks require clips for installation. If your model does use clips, they should come in the package with your new sink. If you’re missing a clip or 2, it’s possible that the clips from your old sink may work."

Your goal here is to create a waterproof barrier between the rim of the sink and the countertop so that water can’t seep in under the sink rim. Once you’ve run the bead of caulk around the sink rim, wet your index finger and run it around the entire bead to smooth the caulk in place. Then use damp paper towels to wipe away any excess.

Although it will be a tight fit in the sink cabinet, this is safer and easier with a second set of hands helping you. While the second person holds the bottom of the sink, remove the several clips (often 4-6) that pin the sink rim against the underside of the counter. They will either be screwed or epoxied into place. [17] X Research source If they’re attached with screws, simply use a screwdriver to remove them. If they are stuck in place with epoxy, use a putty knife to scrape, pry, and wedge the clips apart from the underside of the counter. Once you remove the clips, the sink will be free to fall, so make sure it’s being held up by someone!"

Cut a section of 2 in × 4 in (5.1 cm × 10.2 cm) lumber so it’s at least a few inches/centimeters longer than the width of the opening for the sink in the countertop. Lay this piece of wood across the opening. Then, while a second person lifts the new sink up into place from beneath, feed the bar clamp up through the drain opening of the sink so that one of its clamps holds up the sink from below. Secure the other clamp to the piece of wood and tighten it. [21] X Research source Make sure the clamp is tight enough to make the some of the silicone caulk squeeze out between the rim of the sink and the underside of the counter.

Your new undermount sink will come with support clips to place around the underside of the sink where it meets the underside of the counter. In some cases, these clips may attach with screws. If so, drill pilot holes and use a screwdriver to secure the clips in place. Otherwise, use the brand or type of epoxy recommended by the sink manufacturer. [22] X Research source In most cases, the clips are adhered in place with a 2-part epoxy that hardens in about 10 minutes after being combined. Follow the product instructions carefully and apply the proper amount to each clip. Then press them into place as per the installation instructions for your sink."

Leave the piece of lumber and bar clamp in place for a day before removing them. After that, you can put the drain in place and continue with the installation. [23] X Research source Like faucets, drain installations vary by type and brand, but the process is DIY-friendly if you follow the instructions carefully. You could rely on the epoxy to hold everything in place after 10 minutes and not wait the full 24 hours before proceeding, but this is not recommended. Be patient!"

      "content": "Allow the caulk on a top-mount sink to cure for 24 hours. Instead of making the final connections right away, it’s better to give the silicone caulk time to set up. This will prevent the sink from shifting and breaking the solid bead of caulk that you made. [24] X Research source If you’re installing an undermount sink, you should already have waited 24 hours before putting in the sink drain. In this case, you can proceed with the last steps of the installation."

      "content": "Reconnect the water lines and the P-trap underneath the sink. You just need to do the reverse of the disconnecting process. Hand-tighten the water lines where they connect to the hot and cold shutoff valves or use a crescent wrench if needed. Similarly, use your hands to tighten the nut on a PVC P-trap or channel locks for a metal P-trap. [25] X Research source If your new sink drain is a little shorter than your old one, you can buy a P-trap pipe extension at your local hardware store. The extension can be cut to fit and will also connect in place with a nut that you’ll either hand-tighten or secure with channel locks. If your new sink drain is a little too long, you can cut off some of the pipe either at the top of the P-trap or the bottom of the drain. Use a hacksaw or pipe cutter to make the adjustment."

Then, open the hot and cold faucet taps fully and let the water run for at least 2-3 minutes. Watch under the cabinet for any leaks in the water lines, drain lines, or elsewhere. Tighten any loose connections as needed. [26] X Research source Keep the bucket or towel at the bottom of the sink cabinet while you test for leaks. If you have a leak at a pipe connection, try shutting off the water, undoing the connection, wrapping some plumber’s tape around the pipe threads, and then re-making the connection. If you can’t figure out where a leak is coming from and/or how to fix it, shut off the water supply lines and call a plumber."
