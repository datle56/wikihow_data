To make the single-pin pick, unbend a bobby pin so it's straight. Then, bend the flat end of the bobby pin slightly upward. Whether you use homemade tools or buy a lock picking kit, you will need a tension wrench and a pick (or a rake)."

Then, bend the flat end of the paper clip until it makes a 90-degree angle with the rest of the paper clip. To make the single-pin pick, unbend half of a second paper clip. Bend the flat end of the paper clip so it goes slightly upward. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Push the pin at the back of the lock up with your pick. Master padlocks have a series of pins that all need to be raised above the cylinder so the cylinder can rotate and unlock the lock. To find the pin at the back of the lock, gently push up on the top of the inside of the lock with the pin until you feel something push upward. Once you've found the pin, press down on the handle of the pick to lift the end of the pick and push the pin up above the cylinder. When you push up the pin, the cylinder will rotate slightly and catch the pin so it doesn't fall back down."

If you encounter a pin that feels stuck, you may need to wiggle the pick up and down a few times to get the pin to go up. The last pin you push up should be the pin closest to the keyhole on the lock. Once all of the pins are up, the cylinder should turn — as long as you're still applying pressure to the tension wrench — and the lock should pop open. [5] X Research source"
