      "content": "Papa Legba is a Haitian Vodou spirit associated with crossroads. In the Haitian Vodou religion and belief system, Papa Legba is a loa (Haitian spirit/god) who serves as the gatekeeper between the human and spirit worlds. He stands at a spiritual crossroads to grant or deny people’s permission to speak with the spirits. While he is mostly associated with Haitian Vodou, he originated as part of West African Vodun. [1] X Research source In Haiti, Papa Legba also serves as the great elocutioner and facilitates communication, speech, and understanding. He is believed to speak all languages of the world. Because many African practices blended with Catholicism, Papa Legba is also associated with saints like St. Peter, St. Anthony, and St. Lazarus."

While Papa Legba has made many appearances in modern pop culture, he is perhaps most well-known for appearing in “Coven,” the third season of American Horror Story . However, his depiction was very inaccurate, as he was given a frightening appearance and more closely resembled Bawon Samdi, another Vodou spirit who serves as master of the dead. [10] X Research source In American Horror Story , Papa Legba was depicted with glowing red eyes and a top hat decorated with skulls. In addition to AHS, Papa Legba has been featured or referenced in several 20th-century blues songs, like Robert Johnson’s “Me and the Devil Blues,” as well as books like Neil Gaiman’s American Gods and Terry Pratchett’s Witches Abroad. He is even included in an episode of Miami Vice ."
