[3] X Trustworthy Source HealthyChildren.org Health information from the American Academy of Pediatrics.

[4] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Go for a dark meat cut such as chicken thighs or leg quarters. Since most baby formulas are fortified with iron and other important micronutrients, it’s not as important for formula-fed babies to get the additional iron found in dark meat. Ask your pediatrician whether dark meat or white meat is a better choice for your baby. [5] X Trustworthy Source Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Main public health institute for the US, run by the Dept. of Health and Human Services Go to source Chicken thighs are also higher in fat compared to the breasts, which makes them more flavorful and easier to puree. [6] X Research source You will need 1-2 thighs to make about ½ cup (approximately 65 g) of cooked chicken. A single 6 oz (170 g) bone-in, skin-on thigh will yield about 3 ounces (85 g) of meat, but you’ll need more if you’re using small thighs. [7] X Research source"

If that’s not available, peel off the skin and cut the meat off the bones. [8] X Research source Chicken skin does not puree well. If you leave it on, you may end up with large pieces of skin in your puree, which could cause your baby to choke."

[9] X Research source Put the chicken on a cutting board and slice it into strips about 1 ⁄ 2 inch (1.3 cm) wide, then cut across the strips widthwise to make cubes. Putting the chicken in your freezer for 15 minutes before you slice it will make it easier to cut. [10] X Research source Always take care when using a sharp knife . Keep your fingertips curled under when holding the chicken in place so you don’t accidentally cut them."

[24] X Research source Use a small amount of any seasoning at first so that your baby can get used to the new flavor. Wait to try this until your baby has already tried pure chicken puree, and only experiment with 1 seasoning at a time.

Steaming your fruits or vegetables rather than boiling them will help them taste better and retain more of their nutrients. Add about 1/4 cup (approx. 45 g) of the cooked fruits vegetables to the blender or food processor along with the chicken. Try combining chicken with apples, pears, carrots, sweet potatoes, peas, or spinach. Only experiment with 1 new ingredient at a time so that you can easily identify any foods your baby is allergic to."
