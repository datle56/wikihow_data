[2] X Expert Source Ashley Pritchard, MA School Counselor Expert Interview. 4 November 2019. Focus on every word coming out of your teacher’s mouth and really try to comprehend what they’re getting at. If you listen and focus in class , you’ll get caught up in what you’re doing and forget you were ever bored in the first place! [3] X Research source You are more likely to be bored if you’re just passively waiting for class to be over than if you’re actively doing something.

While the research is mixed, there’s some evidence that the act of writing can cure boredom—even when you’re just writing random nonsense over and over.

      "content": "Raise your hand when you have a question and engage in class discussions. Class may feel like it’s taking forever if you just sit there twiddling your thumbs, but it’ll be over before you know it if you find ways to participate. By asking questions or engaging in educational conversations, you’re giving yourself something to actively do which will make time fly. [7] X Trustworthy Source Edutopia Educational nonprofit organization focused on encouraging and celebrating classroom innovation Go to source Asking and answering questions will also help you retain the information you’re learning. [8] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source If your goal is to do well in school , asking questions is a good place to start. Nobody said your questions have to be good. You can always ask, “When was this book written?” or, “How many cells are in the human body?” So long as your questions are related to the materials in class, your teacher won’t have a problem answering them."

      "content": "Drawing gives you something to focus on, which will help time pass. If class is moving at a snail's pace or you aren’t in the mood to write your notes out, try drawing them. Craft a portrait of the president you’re learning about, or make a diagram of that chemical compound. [10] X Research source Drawing your notes out still technically counts as note-taking, so your teacher won’t be too angry about it if they catch you sketching something educational. There’s evidence that drawing will actually help you process what you’re learning about, so this isn’t a particularly bad way to focus in class. Some people have an easier time comprehending information visually, so you may want to continue doing this when you aren’t bored if you find it easier to learn this way.

It’s never the best idea to stop paying attention in class, but if you really can’t handle it, maybe you can still do something productive. Your homework will need to get done at some point, so you might as well do it now while you’re waiting for class to end. [13] X Expert Source Ashley Pritchard, MA School Counselor Expert Interview. 4 November 2019. Keep your notes for the current class out and try to split your time between focusing on what you’re learning in class and what your homework is about. Try to only do this if you have some downtime during a group activity or if you already have a strong understanding of the topic you’re currently covering in class. If you’re really struggling in history, the first lesson on a new unit about World War 1 is not the best time to break out that Spanish homework."

Getting lost in a good book is one of the best ways to productively spend your time if you’ve totally opted out of the lesson.

Writing is a fun way to get caught up in something, which will distract you while you wait for class to end. This isn’t the world’s most productive way to pass your time at school, but at least it involves thinking about something! [23] X Research source The other upside here is that it will look like you’re just taking notes.

Daydreaming isn’t going to help you do well in school, but at least it will pass the time without getting you in trouble. It’s okay to daydream every now and then, but try to make an effort to tune back in whenever something really important is happening in class.

      "content": "Raise your hand and ask for a hall pass if you need a quick break. Everyone needs a brain break every once in a while, and a quick walk to the restroom is a great way to take a 5-minute trip outside of the class. Getting up and walking around will also help your brain refocus when you return to class, so this is a great option if you find your mind wandering and you’d like to stay focused on the lesson. [29] X Trustworthy Source Edutopia Educational nonprofit organization focused on encouraging and celebrating classroom innovation Go to source Just try to avoid relying on this option too often. Your teacher may get annoyed if you ask to use the bathroom every day in their class, and they may even revoke your hallway privileges if you go overboard."

You’re more likely to feel like things are moving along if you ignore the clock entirely.
