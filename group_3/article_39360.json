    {
      "title": "Stand inside the shooting semicircle.",
      "content": "Stand inside the shooting semicircle. According to netball rules, you can only shoot when you're inside this portion of the court, which includes the line that marks the circle. Align your body with the netball post, with your feet and hips shoulder distance apart and facing forward. [1] X Research source Proper balance is key to an accurate netball shot, so be sure that your weight is distributed evenly between both feet."

    {
      "title": "Hold the netball with your dominant hand.",
      "content": "Hold the netball with your dominant hand. Position it behind and under the ball, and use your fingertips to cradle it softly. [2] X Research source For better control, ensure that the gap between your palm and the ball is minimal. Make sure that your fingers are relaxed as they hold the ball. If they're grasping too tight or are too straight, your shot may be off."
    },
    {
      "title": "Steady the ball with your other hand.",
      "content": "Steady the ball with your other hand. Stabilizing it allows you to give the ball extra spin when you shoot. [3] X Research source However, make sure that your second hand doesn't put too much pressure on the ball because it can throw off your shot. New or young netball players may want to use both hands to hold the ball in order to generate enough power to shoot, but keep in mind that it can actually increase the chance of shooting errors. While it’s okay to start out shooting with two hands, practice using one hand. Using one hand to shoot and the other only to steady the ball ensures a more accurate shot."

    {
      "title": "Stretch your arms over your head.",
      "content": "Stretch your arms over your head. You want to hold the ball high for the most accurate shot, so your elbows are near your forehead and slightly flexed. Make sure that they're facing the netball post too. [4] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Have the goal net in your view.",
      "content": "Have the goal net in your view. Imagine a cone above the net, like a witch's hat, and focus on the highest, most center point -- that's where you want to aim the ball. The best shots fall through without actually touching the ring, so you want to keep the ball as centered as possible. All of your focus should be on the hoop, so do your best to ignore distractions. It may help to line the edge of the ball up with the edge of the hoop before you take your shot."
    },
    {
      "title": "Bend your knees and elbows at the same time.",
      "content": "Bend your knees and elbows at the same time. While your arms and hands will determine what direction the ball goes in, the real power for your shot comes from the lower body. That means you have to prepare to push up through your ankles and knees. [5] X Research source For the best form, keep your elbows at a right angle, while holding the ball steady. You should also keep your back straight and hold your head up high."
    },
    {
      "title": "Push up and release the ball.",
      "content": "Push up and release the ball. To generate the most power for your shot, your arms and knees should straighten at the same time, while your dominant hand flicks the ball upwards. That helps create a backward spin that allows for a high ball trajectory as it soars toward the net, so it drops through without touching the ring. [6] X Research source For the most accurate shot, you must release the ball when your arms are at full extension. Releasing early can throw your shot off. In game action, put your hand up as soon as the ball is out of your hands. That way, if you don't get it in, you can have another try."
    },
    {
      "title": "Keep practicing.",
      "content": "Keep practicing. It will take time to develop your skills, but shooting goals will get easier the more you try. Test how far you need to bend to create the most powerful shot, and then try to replicate the form each time that you take a shot."
    },
    {
      "title": "Take longer shots.",
      "content": "Take longer shots. While you must be inside the shooting semicircle, it is a fairly large area, which means there are a variety of distances that you can shoot from. If you’re new to netball, you’ll probably begin practicing your shooting closer to the goal. As you become more comfortable, though, start increasing the distance of your shot. That way, you’ll be able to shoot from all over the semicircle with accuracy. [7] X Research source"

      "title": "Shoot with a feeder in place.",
      "content": "Shoot with a feeder in place. During game action, you’ll have the ball passed to you before you take your shot. To become comfortable shooting in that situation, it helps to practice with another player feeding you the ball. You’ll learn to receive the ball and shoot it in one smooth motion. You should start outside the shooting semicircle, while the other player begins inside the semicircle with the ball. The other player should feed you the ball from in front of you, so you can run into it to receive it. Once you’ve received the ball, take the time to set up your shot properly. You don’t want to just rush through the shooting and possibly throw your shot off. Practice running into the semicircle to receive the ball from various spots outside and at various speeds. You’ll never know exactly what situation will come up in game action."
    },
    {
      "title": "Shoot with a defender in place.",
      "content": "Shoot with a defender in place. In a game, the other team’s defence will try to keep you from scoring a goal, which obviously makes it more difficult to shoot accurately. That’s why it helps to practice shooting with another player trying to defend you. You’ll get used to the distraction, and learn the best way to get around a defender. Start by standing opposite the hoop. The defending player should stand between you and it, with her arms raised over her head to effectively block your shot. Try to shoot the ball over the defender’s arms and through the hoop. Remember to practice the right form as you avoid the defender, or your shot may not be as accurate as you’d like."
