      "title": "Build a repertoire of music before you pitch.",
      "content": "Build a repertoire of music before you pitch. Ask yourself critical questions: how is your music's flow? What quality are your recordings? What could you do to strengthen your music collection? Your music is your first impression, so wait until you're ready to share with publishers. Play local concerts in your area before pitching to gain a small following. This will make your music look more reputable to publishers. Purchase home recording instruments or visit a professional recording studio. High-quality recordings are key to getting your foot in the door."

      "title": "Research publishers specializing in your genre.",
      "content": "Research publishers specializing in your genre. Look for musicians who play similar music to you and write down their publisher's information. Check official databases for publishing information. Broadcast Music Incorporated (BMI); the American Society of Composers, Authors, and Publishers (ASCAP); and the Society of European Stage Actors and Composers (SESAC) are all trusted resources.

      "title": "Research administration agreements if you want to retain song rights.",
      "content": "Research administration agreements if you want to retain song rights. Before you pitch, check what deals a publisher offers. Administration agreements grant full ownership to the songwriter and primarily focus on registering your songs. Administration agreements are usually short-term, though they can be renewed by the record label. [2] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Look for co-publishing deals if you want an up-front advance.",
      "content": "Look for co-publishing deals if you want an up-front advance. Co-publishing agreements require musicians to sacrifice 50% of their ownership in exchange for higher advances and royalties. Co-publishing deals are most popular within the music industry. Some publishers also offer work-for-hire agreements. You give up all ownership and administration rights in exchange for promotion. These are most common with film and advertising labels."

    {
      "title": "Network",
      "content": "Network within the music industry. Even if you live far from music hubs like Nashville or Los Angeles, you can build relationships in the publishing industry. Apply for an internship at a record label, staff the info booth at music festivals, or volunteer with local music organizations. Interact with music publishers on social media sites, and communicate with other hopeful musicians on message boards. [3] X Research source Stay humble when connecting with others. Remember: nobody owes you anything. [4] X Research source Follow up after you've met a music publisher with an email. Tell them it was nice to meet them and that you hope to collaborate with them later on. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Compile a music demo.",
      "content": "Compile a music demo. Choose 2-4 songs to feature on your demo, and arrange them on a CD, MP3 file, or music streaming website. The songs chosen should represent your sound. Include your contact information, like your (or your band's) name, your song titles, your email and home addresses, and your phone number. You can embed your contact information into the file via metadata to make sure the publisher has all needed information. [6] X Research source Before choosing songs, play several at a gig or open mike to gauge which are audience favorites."

      "title": "Make a list of the top five publishers in your genre.",
      "content": "Make a list of the top five publishers in your genre. Submitting your music to every major publisher won't increase your chances of publication. You'll want to personalize your pitch. Narrow your sights to four or five publishers you have the best chance with."

    {
      "title": "Call or email potential publishers to ask about pitching policies.",
      "content": "Call or email potential publishers to ask about pitching policies. Ask permission to email your pitch first. Some publishers accept submissions, but others personally contact potential clients. Once you've received a green light, you can send your demo."
    },
    {
      "title": "Send an email with your demo included as a link.",
      "content": "Send an email with your demo included as a link. Unless the publisher specifically asks for a CD demo, email your demo rather than mailing it. The best submission emails are short and efficient. Let them know why you submitted to them and how your music fits within their specialization. Remember to thank the publisher for their time and consideration. Keep the subject header professional. \"Demo Submission: [Your Name]\" is a safe choice. Check a publisher's policy before you attach an MP3 file. Most publishers prefer a demo link in the body of your submission. [7] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Follow up after you've sent your demo.",
      "content": "Follow up after you've sent your demo. Check your publisher's estimated response times, which will usually be on their website. If enough time has passed without a response, send a quick email thanking them consideration and reminding them of your pitch. Follow up again after several weeks, if you're met with more silence the publisher is clearly not interested. [8] X Research source Don't overdo your email. Two to three sentences will suffice. [9] X Research source After you've followed up twice with no response, move on! Don't waste you're time because other publishers may be interested."

    {
      "title": "Prepare for an in-person meeting, if invited.",
      "content": "Prepare for an in-person meeting, if invited. The music publisher will likely schedule a meeting if they like your music. Have a playlist ready of your best music to showcase during the meeting. You won't have time to spotlight all 20 of your songs, so have two songs you didn't feature on the demo ready. [10] X Research source Dress in formal but comfortable clothes. Business casual is the safest option. [11] X Research source Do research about the music publisher before the meeting for a positive first impression."

      "title": "Act respectfully during the meeting.",
      "content": "Act respectfully during the meeting. Music publishers want to work with professional musicians. Arrive on time (preferably early) to your meeting, and thank them for the opportunity. This music publisher took time out of their busy schedule to meet with you: show them they haven't wasted their time. [12] X Research source Don't defend your music if the publisher has criticism. Instead, listen and learn from their advice. They will be more likely to look at future work if you're open to their opinion."

      "title": "Find a music lawyer, if offered a publication deal.",
      "content": "Find a music lawyer, if offered a publication deal. Suppose the interview goes well and you're offered a publishing contract. Your next step is hiring a music lawyer. Your lawyer will help you understand the contract and protect your royalties. Law jargon is often hard to understand, so your lawyer will best negotiate your rights as the musician. If you're friends with other musicians, ask for attorney referrals. Make sure you and your potential lawyer have good chemistry and that they have your best interests in mind."

    {
      "title": "Don't sign the same song with multiple publishers.",
      "content": "Don't sign the same song with multiple publishers. Once a publisher has agreed to sign on your song, don't submit it to others. Doing so is unprofessional and disrespectful to your publisher. Instead, record a variety of songs so you have a large repertoire available for submission."

    {
      "title": "Produce high-quality music recordings.",
      "content": "Produce high-quality music recordings. Because self-published musicians publicize their own music, your recordings will need to be as professional as possible. If you can't afford recording equipment, visit a nearby studio. Practice your music extensively before you record it, and run a dress rehearsal several days before you record. Make sure your voice is rested and your instruments tuned before you begin recording."

      "content": "Copyright your music. You can copyright recordings, song lyrics, or both. Register for an account at your country's copyright office website and fill out an application.

      "content": "Interact with your fans on social media platforms. Social media is a great way to engage with and gain more listeners. Answer questions, respond to feedback, and post about upcoming events. Comment on other musicians' profiles to build friendly networks. Don't sign up for more social media sites than you can handle. Pick 2-3 to build a presence on so you can manage the upkeep."

      "content": "Distribute your music online. Uploading your music to sites like Spotify , iTunes, or RadioAirplay will give your fans an easy way to play or purchase it.
