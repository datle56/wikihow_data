If you're using Zelle in your banking app, it will have access to your bank account. If you're using the Zelle standalone app, you'll have to use a debit card. If you're using a bank account on one app and a debit card on the other, make sure the debit card is linked to that bank account. Zelle is built into many banking apps, but if your bank doesn't offer it, you can download the standalone Zelle app from the App Store or the Google Play Store . If you are using Zelle to send money to yourself, you will need separate Zelle accounts for each bank account. You will need either a phone number or email to create an account, and each phone number or email can only be used once. If you don't have a debit card or bank account added to PayPal, check out this wikiHow article on connecting one to your account ."
