      "title": "Make an appointment with a dermatologist.",
      "content": "Make an appointment with a dermatologist. Going about mole removal the safe way is a decision you won't regret. It's extremely important to have your mole examined by a professional rather than trying to remove it yourself, even if you just want it removed for cosmetic reasons. When you see a physician, he or she will be able to tell whether the mole is potentially cancerous. If it is, professional removal is the only safe method, since other methods won't adequately deal with the cancer cells. If you don't have a dermatologist, ask your primary care physician to refer you to one. If you don't have health insurance, see if there's a health clinic in your area that provides mole removal services or referrals. Keep in mind that some doctors have the ability to remove moles in their office."

      "content": "Determine whether a biopsy is needed. At your appointment, the doctor will examine your mole's shape, borders, size, color, and surface texture, to see whether it appears to be cancerous. [1] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Family Physicians Organization devoted to improving the health of patients, families, and communities Go to source If the mole exhibits common symptoms of melanoma or another type of skin cancer, the doctor will order a biopsy to test whether cancer cells are present. If it doesn't, the doctor will be able to go ahead and remove the mole. The sample will often be sent for analysis even if the mole does not appear to be cancerous. To perform a biopsy, a sample from the mole will be taken using either a shave or punch biopsy. This sample will then be sent to a lab and tested. If it comes back positive, further treatment will be needed. If it's negative, you can choose to keep the mole or have it removed."

      "title": "See if shaving is an option.",
      "content": "See if shaving is an option. Surgical shaving is a procedure in which the mole is shaved off the surface of the skin. Local anesthesia is administered near the mole, so you won't feel pain during the process (aside from a needle prick). No stitches are required to heal a surgical shave. The process may leave a small scar behind. [2] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source In some cases the area is also cauterized using a tool that burns away layers of skin to reduce the chances that the mole will grow back. This option may be available for moles that are noncancerous and relatively small. Moles that cover a larger surface area are too big to be shaved off and cauterized."

    {
      "title": "Have a surgical excision if necessary.",
      "content": "Have a surgical excision if necessary. If the mole is cancerous, or if it's large and covers a big surface area, it will probably need to be removed using surgical excision. After administering local anesthesia, the dermatologist will make a deeper cut to remove the mole and surrounding tissues, preventing it from growing back. The wound is then closed using sutures designed to leave minimal scarring. [3] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source While it may sound like a big deal, surgical excision is actually a quick, out-patient medical procedure. Removing the mole will likely take between 20 to 30 minutes, depending on the size of the mole. Since only local anesthesia is administered, you'll be fine to drive home and go about your day as normal. Be sure to care for the wound as directed. You may have to return to the doctor's office to get the sutures removed. Keep in mind that the incision for this procedure is very small. If there is hair growth, then the doctor will cut out the root of the hair."

      "content": "Look into cryotherapy. Cryotherapy is a common treatment for moles as well. This procedure freezes off the mole using liquid nitrogen on a cotton applicator. It is a common treatment with few adverse effects that are usually short-lived. [4] X Research source Your primary care doctor or a dermatologist can perform cryotherapy as an in-office procedure. Some offices even have nurses who are trained to perform cryotherapy. Keep in mind that with cryotherapy, there will be no tissue to send to the lab for testing because it will have been frozen off."

      "content": "Ask about electrosurgery. Another option that you might discuss with your doctor is electrosurgery. This type of mole removal can help to control any bleeding that may occur, which may reduce the risk of complications, promote rapid healing, and result in minimal scarring.

      "title": "Avoid using mole removal creams.",
      "content": "Avoid using mole removal creams. These creams are often sold online, marketed as a cheap, noninvasive alternative to surgical removal. In fact, mole removal creams can end up leaving deep pockets in your skin, since they go beyond the mole and dig into the skin underneath, causing irreparable damage. The small scar left behind by surgical removal is minimal in comparison. [6] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source In addition, mole removal creams don't address the issue of whether or not the mole is cancerous. Applying it to a cancerous mole can be very dangerous; cancerous cells could remain and end up growing out of control without your knowledge. Don't use any type of cream or other product without consulting a doctor first."

      "content": "Don't ignore a mole that's changing. If you don't like the prospect of having surgery, you might be tempted to let your mole be and forget about it. That's usually fine, unless you notice that the mole has changed over time. A changing mole can be a sign of the presence of cancer cells, so you should have any mole checked out by your doctor. Use the ABCDE guide to examine your mole. If you notice the following, be sure to make an appointment with a doctor: [7] X Trustworthy Source American Cancer Society Nonprofit devoted to promoting cancer research, education, and support Go to source A is for asymmetrical shape. If your mole has two very different looking halves, this could be a sign of cancer. B is for border; look for moles with irregular, rather than smooth, borders. C is for color. Moles that have changed in color, have more than one color, or have color gradations should be checked out. D is for diameter. If your mole is larger than 1 ‚ÅÑ 4 inch (0.6 cm) and still growing, have it checked. E is for evolving. Look for any changes to your mole that occur over weeks or months."

It also makes older moles more susceptible to changing and developing cancer. Be sure to protect yourself from UV rays so you don't develop new moles, and your existing ones stay healthy. Use sunscreen with SPF 30 or higher, even in the winter. Your sunscreen should also offer broad spectrum protection against UVA and UVB rays, and it should be water resistant.
