Allow the doctor to examine your heel, and provide as many details as you can about how the injury happened. Let them know if you have any other medical conditions (such as diabetes) that might affect the healing process. In addition to a physical exam, they will probably order imaging tests, such as: [2] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source X-rays, which can confirm or rule out a broken heel and show whether the bones in your foot have been displaced by the injury. A CT scan, from which your doctor can get a better idea of the type and severity of your fracture(s). They may order a CT scan if the X-ray confirms that you have a fracture in your heel."

      "content": "Talk to your doctor about nonsurgical treatment options. If the fracture is not too severe and the bones in and around your heel are not displaced, your doctor may recommend immobilizing your foot for several weeks while it heals. They will put a splint, cast, or brace on your foot to keep the bones in place and prevent further damage. Follow your doctor’s instructions for caring for your splint or cast, and follow up as recommended to make sure your foot is healing properly. [3] X Research source Your doctor will probably recommend the RICE treatment (rest, ice, compression, and elevation) to help your foot heal and reduce inflammation. This treatment involves keeping weight off the injured foot, applying ice packs, and using a bandage to gently compress the area. You’ll also need to keep your foot elevated as much as possible. [4] X Research source You will likely need to wear your splint or cast for at least 6 to 8 weeks. Don’t put any weight on your injured foot until your doctor says it is safe to do so. Your doctor may also give you additional home care instructions, such as keeping your foot elevated above your heart level and using ice packs on the injury to reduce swelling. [5] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source Some heel fractures are good candidates for a procedure called “closed reduction,” in which the doctor manipulates your foot to move displaced bone fragments into the correct position.

You may need surgery if your heel has multiple fractures, the pieces of bone have moved out of place, or there is damage to the muscle and other soft tissue in your heel. If your doctor recommends surgery, ask them about the risks and benefits of the procedure and discuss what the recovery process will be like. [7] X Research source If the tissues around the bone are injured and inflamed, your doctor may recommend waiting a few days for the swelling to go down before performing surgery. In other cases (e.g., if there is an open wound at the site of the break), it’s important to operate right away. The surgery may involve putting screws or plates in your heel to keep the bone fragments in place. You will need to wear a cast for several weeks after the surgery and may have to wear a special boot for a while after the cast is removed."

You may need to: [8] X Research source Use crutches, a walker, or another assistive device to keep weight off your injured foot while it’s healing.

      "content": "Ask your doctor about your recovery timeframe. It can take a long time to heal from a heel fracture. Your recovery time will depend on a lot of factors, including your overall health, the severity of the fracture, and the treatment you received. Work with your doctor to determine when you can safely begin rehabilitation, and ask for an estimate of how long it will be before you can go back to your regular activities. [12] X Research source Depending on your condition, you may be able to start working on physical therapy and other rehabilitation activities within the first week after treatment. [13] X Research source If your fracture was relatively minor, it will probably be around 3-4 months before you can return to your normal activities. For a more severe or complicated fracture, your recovery time may be 1 or 2 years. Unfortunately, many heel fractures never heal completely. You may experience some permanent loss of function in your foot and ankle. Talk to your doctor or a physical therapist about what to expect."

[14] X Research source You may need to wait until your pain allows movement or until any surgical wounds have healed. Early exercises may include: [15] X Research source Ankle pumps.
