If your visa petition was approved, you probably had to sign an affidavit of support, Form I-864, so your spouse could get a green card. This document is a legally binding contract between yourself and the U.S. government in which you agreed to financially support your immigrant spouse. If you don't withdraw this document, you will still be liable for your spouse's support, even if you get divorced and possibly even if you get the marriage annulled. [16] X Research source Your spouse would need your cooperation here to get his green card. So if you withdraw your affidavit and refuse any further support, your spouse's immigration process would be stalled if not halted. [17] X Research source However, keep in mind that if your spouse already has his green card, you likely cannot affect his immigration status simply by withdrawing support. Despite this, consider withdrawing your affidavit anyway to avoid further legal liability. [18] X Research source . The naturalization or any other petition your spouse will file will trigger required action by USCIS on addressing the fraud. You must withdraw all petitions or affidavits you've filed on behalf of your spouse or any of his family members to ensure that you no longer have continuing legal or financial responsibility for them. Simply ending the marriage will not terminate your responsibility for them. [19] X Research source Consider doing it on your own, without an attorney as attorneys could be part of fraud if you filed petition via an attorney."

If you were the victim of marriage fraud, you also could face criminal charges if you don't handle the matter quickly and carefully, so having legal representation is most important in that situation. The first step is withdrawing either i-130 or any other petition you or a lawyer have filed. Divorce simply ends the marriage, while if you get the marriage annulled it is treated as though it never happened - retroactively dissolved. Having the marriage annulled could have vastly different consequences for you than simply getting a divorce. Child(s) is protected thus annulment is your best bet. Family court will be reluctant on granting an annulment, however, you have to push to get it. You can further ask the same court to make corrections to the birth certificate(s) of the child to remove your spouse's name."

Otherwise, the reasoning goes, you can't argue that you never would've married your spouse had you known the truth, because after you knew the truth you continued to live as a married couple."

If your spouse has applied for a green card on the basis of his marriage to you (for i-360), an annulment of the marriage will cancel the application as USCIS follows the statutes during adjustment of the status.
