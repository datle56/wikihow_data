    {
      "title": "Her pics and bio have a lot of good conversation topics about her interests.",
      "content": "Her pics and bio have a lot of good conversation topics about her interests. Scour through your match’s photos and bio to find something interesting that you want to talk about. You could mention what you see in the background of her pics, answer a question she listed in her bio, or scroll through her interests to see what you have in common. “UGH is that the Eiffel Tower?? I’ve always wanted to go to France! What was your favorite part of your trip?” “Oh my gosh, I never thought I’d meet someone else who likes pineapple on pizza. I’m glad we’re in this together!” “It’s so cool that you’re studying film! Was there a movie that inspired you to do that?”"
    },
    {
      "title": "Questions make the girl open up so you can build your connection.",
      "content": "Questions make the girl open up so you can build your connection. Open-ended questions start with “what” or “how” and need a longer response to answer. You could ask something about her childhood, her favorite hobbies, or her life in general. When she responds, be sure to answer the question too so she can learn about you. “What was your favorite memory from growing up?” “How would you spend your perfect day off? “What was the best advice someone has ever given you?”"

    {
      "title": "Show off your sense of humor so she knows you’re fun to be around.",
      "content": "Show off your sense of humor so she knows you’re fun to be around. While they may sound a little cheesy, jokes will make her laugh and put her in a good mood. You could try a silly joke when there’s a lull in the conversation, or make light of something that you noticed in her profile as long as you aren’t mean about it. “Have I told you that your dog is so cute? You’re not too bad either though 😏” “Alright, I know it’s been a long day, but I’m here! What were your other two wishes?” “I don’t usually like dried fruit, but I’d try a date with you 😛”"
    },
    {
      "title": "You’ll let your match know that you’re really into her.",
      "content": "You’ll let your match know that you’re really into her. Find something impressive on your match’s profile or further back in your conversation. You can mention one of her talents, her interests, or a feature you find attractive. Be careful not to make any sexual remarks when you first start chatting since it could make her feel uncomfortable. “I love all the art on your profile! You’re such a talented painter!” “Wow, your eyes are so stunning, I couldn’t look away from your profile!” “You have an amazing taste in music. I can’t wait to ask for recommendations!”"

    {
      "title": "Your match will see your reaction as soon as they match with you.",
      "content": "Your match will see your reaction as soon as they match with you. Even though girls make the first move on Bumble, you can start off on a good note with an emoji reaction and comment. Press the react button on one of her pics or on her bio and choose the emoji you want to send. If she matches with you, she’ll see your reaction and comment right away. This is a great way to get the conversation going so she doesn’t have to break the ice."

    {
      "title": "Copying how your match talks makes her feel more comfortable.",
      "content": "Copying how your match talks makes her feel more comfortable. If your match sends you short and snappy messages, try to send her messages that have the same tone and length. She’ll see that you’re balancing out the conversation and feel like you’re really good at holding a conversation with her. Her: “Hey, how are you?” You: “I’m good, how about you?” Her: “OMG! I can’t believe we’re both fans of Maroon 5!!” You: “WOW you like them too?! I love them! What’s your fav song?”"

      "title": "Double-texting might make it seem like you’re always available.",
      "content": "Double-texting might make it seem like you’re always available. Rather than sending her a wall of texts, only send her one text at a time so she doesn’t feel overwhelmed. Once she replies, it’s okay to text her after the same amount of time so it doesn’t seem like you were waiting next to your phone for a reply. [1] X Research source If you’re feeling tempted to message her, start doing an activity you love to help take your mind off of her.

      "title": "Your match will appreciate that you’re putting effort into your messages.",
      "content": "Your match will appreciate that you’re putting effort into your messages. Using a lot of shorthand abbreviations and sending typos can be tough to read and could turn your match off of the convo. If you want her to stick around and chat, reread through your messages before you send them to check if they make sense or have any errors."

      "title": "You can build a stronger connection if you can see your match.",
      "content": "You can build a stronger connection if you can see your match. Bumble allows you to start a video call with your match before you meet. Find a quiet time when you’re both free to chat so you can hop on video. It’ll feel a lot more natural to talk with your match when you can hear her voice and see her face.

      "title": "It’s important to test the physical chemistry with your match.",
      "content": "It’s important to test the physical chemistry with your match. After you’ve gotten to know your match for a while, build up the courage to ask her out so you can meet face-to-face. Suggest a public place where you can easily meet up and talk. You could plan a casual get-together or plan a really romantic date depending on how much you’ve chatted already. “I’ve loved talking to you here. Would you want to grab a coffee this weekend?” “I feel like we’ve got something really good here. When can I take you out to dinner?” “Do you want to meet up this week? I know this great spot to get some drinks.”"

    {
      "title": "You deserve to have someone who’s excited to talk to you.",
      "content": "You deserve to have someone who’s excited to talk to you. Whether your match expires or doesn’t respond, it’s better to look for someone new rather than dwelling on one person. There are probably a ton of other girls on Bumble that are excited to talk to you—you just have to put yourself back out there and start matching again. If your match is about to expire because she hasn’t reached out, you can extend it once for 24 hours. She’ll know that you really want her to message you and she may start the chat."
