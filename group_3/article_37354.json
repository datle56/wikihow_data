This polite, emphatic, and slightly formal phrase is widely understood among English speakers, but it’s most common in British English. [6] X Research source Sample Conversation: Speaker A: “So sorry I’m late, thank you for waiting!” Speaker B: “ That’s quite all right , I didn’t mind!”"

      "title": "“Not at all.”",
      "content": "“Not at all.” “Not at all” is a polite and slightly formal alternative to “You’re welcome” or any other reply to “Thank you.” The phrase expresses that you were happy to help with the task or favor at hand, and that it didn’t bother you to offer assistance. “Not at all” is similar to more common phrases like “No problem” and “No worries,” but it’s slightly more distant and formal.

      "title": "“No problem” or “No worries.”",
      "content": "“No problem” or “No worries.” “No problem” and “No worries” are common, casual replies to “thank you” that essentially have the same meaning—they convey that what you did was no big deal. It’s acceptable to say “No problem” or “No worries” in really informal situations, says Claytor. [8] X Expert Source Tami Claytor Etiquette Coach Expert Interview. 29 September 2020. But, it should only be used if it’s true! If something took effort or time, then don’t be afraid to accept the other person’s gratitude. [9] X Research source These phrases can be acceptable in most situations, but they may also diminish the relationship-building opportunity of the interaction, depending on the individuals involved. For instance, younger people generally see “No problem” as a perfectly acceptable and humble reply to “Thank you.” Older people, however, may view the phrase as disrespectful or dismissive of the gratitude being offered. [10] X Research source Sample Conversation: Speaker A: “Oh, thanks for grabbing that for me!” Speaker B: “ No problem! ”"

      "title": "“Don’t mention it.”",
      "content": "“Don’t mention it.” “Don’t mention it” is a commonly accepted reply to “Thank you” in the English-speaking world, but it’s best suited to slightly informal or casual situations. It implies that the favor or help was not a big deal and doesn’t even merit thanks. For this reason, some people dislike the phrase as it can seem dismissive of the gratitude being expressed, but most people use it automatically and without consideration for its literal meaning. [11] X Research source Sample Conversation: Speaker A: “Thanks for your feedback in the meeting, it was valuable.” Speaker B: “ Don’t mention it, I was happy to provide some insight!”"

      "title": "“It’s nothing.”",
      "content": "“It’s nothing.” If someone says “Thank you” and you reply with “It’s nothing,” you’re essentially saying that the help or task was no big deal. It’s best to use this phrase for simple favors that are truly no bother—like picking up something that someone dropped or grabbing an extra fork for a friend. [12] X Research source Sample Conversation: Speaker A: “I didn’t realize my Zoom camera wasn’t on, thanks for telling me!” Speaker B: “Oh, it’s nothing !”"
    },

      "title": "“That’s okay!”",
      "content": "“That’s okay!” “That’s okay” is a very quick, easy, and casual reply to “Thank you” that’s commonly used by native English speakers—but it can be confusing to English learners since it’s not a grammatically natural reply. It’s often used in informal situations among friends, especially when you’re doing a simple favor for someone else that they might feel grateful for. Sample Conversation: Speaker A: “Thanks for letting me use your phone!” Speaker B: “ That’s okay! ”"

    {
      "title": "“That’s fine!”",

      "title": "“Sure!”",

The phrase is super short, easy to remember, and perfect for replies about simple tasks that don’t take a whole lot of effort. However, it is important to say “Sure” in an enthusiastic tone (visualize an exclamation point at the end). If said in a dull or flat tone, it could be perceived as sarcastic or even rude. [13] X Research source Sample Conversation: Speaker A: “Thanks for calling and checking in!” Speaker B: “ Sure ! I was thinking about you!”"

    {
      "title": "“Anytime.”",
      "content": "“Anytime.” This phrase is used to convey that you’re willing to do a favor or task at any time.

      "content": "“It’s the least I could do!” “It’s the least I could do” is a polite but enthusiastic way to respond to someone who’s thanked you. Essentially, this phrase means that helping this person out was a small thing for you to do, and that you believe you could have (or should have) done even more. “It’s the least I could do” is a great reply to “Thank you” because it’s kind and positive, and it’s appropriate for both casual and formal settings. [17] X Research source Sample Conversation: Speaker A: “Thanks so much for helping us set up the rehearsal dinner last night.” Speaker B: “ It’s the least I could do for your special day!”"

Thank you.”"

      "title": "“I know you’d do the same for me.”",
      "content": "“I know you’d do the same for me.” If someone offers you thanks and you reply that they’d do the same for you, you’re conveying that the pair of you have a reciprocal relationship where you do each other favors out of goodwill or affection. This response also communicates confidence in your ability to help and activates the reciprocity of your partner, friend, or family member. [21] X Research source Sample Conversation: Speaker A: “Thanks for helping me move into my new apartment this weekend. I don't know what I would have done without you!” Speaker B: “ I know you'd do the same for me. ”"

      "content": "Avoid phrases that downplay your help or support, like “It’s nothing.” While opinions on the common replies to “Thank you” may vary, some people believe that you should avoid responses like “No worries,” “Not at all,” “Don’t mention it,” and “It’s nothing.” According to certain schools of thought, these phrases dismiss the other person’s expression of gratitude, and may even indicate an inner feeling of unworthiness in yourself. [22] X Research source They may imply that you don’t feel deserving of the gratitude being given to you, or the other person may even think you’re being rude by deflecting their “Thank you.”"

      "content": "Offer sincere but warm replies in business settings. In business meetings and relationships, avoid casual replies and show your sincerity when responding to “Thank you.” For instance, try to avoid phrases like “No problem,” “Anytime,” and “It's alright” when replying to a client or customer, and stick to more traditional replies like “You’re welcome” or “My pleasure.” [23] X Research source For example, when a partner says “Thanks for writing the contract,” you can simply say, “You are very welcome.” However, you should still use a warm tone, especially when replying to customers and clients. When dealing with a customer or client, you want to convey your appreciation for their business, so you might use a phrase like “We appreciate your business” or “I’m happy to help.” These phrases show clients and customers that you’re grateful for your business and that you’re keen to help them."

When dealing with a client, for example, you might say, “That's part of the complete commitment to service that you can expect when you do business with me.” [24] X Research source If you know anything about the client, you can personalize the message. For example, you can say, \"It is always a pleasure working with you. I hope your big presentation goes well next week.\" Or, in more casual settings, you might reply to a friend or family member by saying something like “It’s the least I could do after everything you’ve done for me” or “I’m happy to help!”"

      "content": "Reply to “thank you” emails in a personal way that’s appropriate for the recipient. There is no standard for replying to “thank you” in an email . Your response should fit the expectations of your audience and your personality. For example, if you are a chatty or outgoing person, go ahead and say “You're welcome” or “It's my pleasure” in response to a “Thank you” email or text message. [26] X Research source Similarly, take into account the personality and demographic of the person (or people) you’re replying to. Younger audiences might not expect a reply to an email or text saying “Thank you.” Even if they do, they’d probably opt for a more casual reply like “No problem” or “Of course.” Older people often have different expectations for etiquette, and may very well appreciate a reply such as “you're welcome.” Responding to a “Thank you” email is considered discretionary. You may want to respond to the “Thank you” email if there is also a question requiring a response in the email, or a specific comment that you wanted to address. In most cases, however, you can probably get away without responding to a “thank you” text or email."
