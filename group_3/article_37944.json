Dogs can become anxious for a variety of reasons, like being around new people, being left alone, or hearing loud noises. If you’ve noticed that your dog has been anxious recently, or if it has been an ongoing problem, make an appointment with your veterinarian to have your dog evaluated and find ways to address the anxiety at home.

      "content": "Ask about acepromazine for a fast-acting sedative. [2] X Expert Source Jamie Freyer, DVM Licensed Veterinarian Expert Interview. 8 October 2021. This is a strong, fast-acting sedative that your dog’s veterinarian may prescribe if you need to sedate your dog in a hurry since it works within 20-30 minutes of administration. The medicine typically comes in the form of tablets or a liquid that you can squirt in between your dog’s gums and cheek. Your dog’s veterinarian will likely prescribe a dose of 1-2 mg per 1 kg (2.2 lb) of body weight. However, follow your veterinarian’s specific dosing instructions for your dog. [3] X Research source There’s also an injectable form of this medication, but this is not something you’d use at home. Your dog’s veterinarian might use it if they needed to sedate your dog for an examination or procedure. Only use ACP prescribed by a vet after they perform a thorough assessment of your dog. [4] X Expert Source Jamie Freyer, DVM Licensed Veterinarian Expert Interview. 8 October 2021. ACP may not be suitable for all dogs since it can lower blood pressure and some breeds may have an intolerance that could make them aggressive. If you have a flat-faced dog breed, they may have an exaggerated reaction to ACP, which may include collapse. If your dog is already agitated, anxious, or distressed, ACP may increase their symptoms rather than relieving them. Test using ACP beforehand if you plan on sedating your dog during travel to see if it works properly or causes hyper-excitement. Avoid using ACP on dogs during fear-inducing events, like thunderstorms or fireworks, since it doesn’t prevent them from feeling fear. The dogs will not be able to move, but they will still get distressed. [5] X Expert Source Jamie Freyer, DVM Licensed Veterinarian Expert Interview. 8 October 2021."
