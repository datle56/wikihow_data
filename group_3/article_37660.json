      "title": "Place the plums in a clean paper bag.",
      "content": "Place the plums in a clean paper bag. Any paper bag will do, just ensure it is empty of all contents except plums. When plums (and other fruit) ripen, they emit ethylene gas. Placing the plums in a paper bag with the top folded over keeps the gas close to the plums, speeding up the ripening process. [1] X Research source An even quicker method is to put a ripe banana in the bag with the plums. The extra ethylene produced by the banana will cause the plums to ripen faster. Don't place the plums in a plastic bag. Using a nonporous bag prevents fresh air from getting to the plums, which can cause them to taste funny or rot. If you prefer, you can ripen the plums by placing them in a fruit bowl, rather than in a bag. The plums will still ripen, they just won't be ready quite as quickly."

      "title": "Store the bag at room temperature.",
      "content": "Store the bag at room temperature. Plums ripen the best when you keep them at a temperature between 68 and 77 degrees Fahrenheit (20-25° C). Just keep them at this temperature until they are fully ripe. [2] X Research source Don't store the bag in a sunny window, as this can cause the plums to overheat. If the plums get too hot, they will begin to rot. Similarly, storing plums in the refrigerator or at a cold temperature before they are ripe can cause chill damage. A chill-damaged plum is unlikely to become juicy and sweet; instead, you may end up with a mealy, tasteless plum."

      "content": "Touch and smell the plums for ripeness every day. The easiest way to tell when your plums are ripe is to lightly press the skin with your finger. If the plum feels soft and your finger makes a slight indentation, the plum is probably ripe. Ripe plums also give off a noticeably sweet and fruity scent. [3] X Research source Here are a few other ways to test for ripeness : Observe the texture of the skin. Plums take on a dusty appearance as they ripen. [4] X Research source Touch a plum near the tip end. When it's ready, that area will be a bit softer than the rest of the plum. [5] X Research source If the plum is still hard to the touch, leave it in the bag for a bit longer. If your finger punctures the plum's skin at the merest touch, the plum may be overripe."

      "content": "Enjoy the ripe plums as soon as possible. Eat the plums raw as soon as they're ripe to prevent them from growing overripe or spoiling. Or, cook the plums by roasting or poaching them, or baking them into desserts. [6] X Research source To halt the ripening process and preserve the plums for a bit longer, store them in your refrigerator's crisper. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "It can take 2 days to 2 weeks for plums to ripen. Depending on how hard the plums were when you bought or harvested them, it can take several days to weeks for them to soften and ripen. Just place the plums in a paper bag, keep them at room temperature, and check on them each day to get them nice and ripe. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Yes, plums continue to ripen after you pick them. Whether you’re harvesting plums from a tree or choosing some to buy at the store, simply leave them on your counter to ripen. Like pears and peaches, plums soften and finish the ripening process after they’re harvested. [9] X Research source Plums are ready to harvest from the tree when they’re mature. This means they’ve turned purple, red, or yellow (depending on the variety) and have a slight give when you press into them. [10] X Research source If you’re buying plums at the store, choose ones that feel heavy, have a slight give when pressed, and are blemish and wrinkle-free."

Wash the plums, slice them into wedges, and remove the pits. Then, lay the plums on a baking sheet and freeze them for 1 to 2 hours. Simply transfer the frozen plums to a plastic freezer bag or container and store them in your freezer. [14] X Research source Frozen plums keep well for around 6 to 8 months. Add frozen plums to smoothies, bake them into desserts, or put them in drinks and cocktails."

For instance: Pickle the plums. [15] X Research source Roast and caramelize the plums. Personal chef Markeicha Dulaney says this helps bring out their sweetness and flavor. Cook a savory plum sauce.
