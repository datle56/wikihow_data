      "content": "One-of-a-Kind Dolls For special events or promotional contests, Mattel (the company that creates Monster High dolls) made several one-of-a-kind Monster High dolls. These are the rarest dolls of the franchise, with only one of each in the world. They probably won’t ever hit the collector’s market—but they’re priceless for their owners. Catia Morais, Canela, & Dracugoona In 2011, Mattel held contests on the Portuguese, Spanish, and French Monster High websites where fans could submit original character designs. The contest winners received their designs as one-of-a-kind dolls. Irbis Snow & Storygi To promote the 2014 film Monster High: Freaky Fusion , Mattel held contests where international fans could submit their original fusions of two characters. The winners received a one-of-a-kind doll based on their fusion. Only the French and Spanish contest-winning dolls are known, as the winners posted photos online.

The Zomby Gaga doll resembles Lady Gaga in the music video for her song “Born This Way.” Not only is the doll itself a covetable collectible for Gaga’s fans (her “monsters”), but its unique prism-shaped box makes it stand out from other releases.

      "content": "Wave One Holt Hyde Like most collectibles, the earliest Monster High dolls tend to be rarer and more valuable than the newer ones. One of the most rare and sought-after among the fandom is Holt Hyde. The Wave One edition of Holt in 2010 is particularly popular—probably because the male characters didn’t sell as much in their original run. [13] X Research source"

      "content": "Skullector’s Edition IT Pennywise As Monster High became more popular, Mattel began releasing Skullector’s Edition dolls (their spin on “collector’s edition”).

    {
      "title": "Rarity",
      "content": "Rarity The number-one factor behind a doll’s value is its rarity. If Mattel produced a doll exclusively for an event like San Diego Comic Con—or as part of a limited-edition line like a Skullector’s Edition—it tends to be worth more on the resale market. That’s because demand for the dolls outweighs the supply. People looking to complete their collections may pay more for rare dolls than for mass-produced ones that are easy to find. Even if a series itself isn’t rare, a doll from the series may be rare because it wasn’t as popular and sold in small quantities before being taken off the market."

    {
      "title": "Age (Generation)",
      "content": "Age (Generation) The original Monster High dolls are known as the Wave One (or first wave) dolls. Because they’re older and debuted before the popular Monster High media franchise, there are less of the Wave One dolls in circulation today. Any doll that’s part of an early generation is likely worth more than its newer counterparts or re-issued versions."
    },
    {
      "title": "Condition",
      "content": "Condition A collectible item in mint (like-new) condition is almost always worth more than one in poor condition. If your Monster High doll is still in its box or at least has all its parts, it should fetch a better price than a played-with doll or one missing its pieces. Of course, if a doll is rare enough, being below mint condition may not bring down its price too much. [21] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Errors",
      "content": "Errors In some instances, an error makes a collectible more valuable because products with mistakes are usually discontinued and recalled. This means fewer of them are in circulation than if they didn’t have an error. This is the case with the factory error edition of Sloman “Slo Mo” Mortavitch. Not every error is valuable. Errors might be a sign that a doll is a knock-off or counterfeit of official Monster High merchandise."

    {
      "title": "Popularity",
      "content": "Popularity Some Monster High characters are more popular with the fanbase than others. These characters’ dolls usually sell for more money than dolls of unpopular or obscure characters because there’s more demand for them. Examples of popular characters include Frankie Stein, Lagoona Blue, Ghoulia Yelps, and Draculaura."

      "title": "Identify your dolls by comparing them to pictures online.",
      "content": "Identify your dolls by comparing them to pictures online. Before you even think about selling your Monster High collection, find out which dolls you have. You probably know the character just by looking at the doll. Visit a collector’s website like MHcollector to compare your doll with official images from Mattel and other collectors. Try to identify the character, the year it was made, what line it was from, and which accessories (if any) it came with. If your doll is in the box, this information should be printed on the packaging. If your doll is out of the box, carefully research to identify it to the best of your ability."

      "content": "Research the market value of your dolls. Once you know which dolls you have, search for them on virtual marketplaces like eBay, Poshmark, Mercari, and Depop and view other sellers’ listings. Some sites allow you to view past sales history as well. Even if you see listings in the thousands of dollars, those might not be fairly priced—try to get an idea of what multiple buyers are selling them for. Note the condition of the dolls in other sellers’ listings. If yours are in poor condition, they shouldn’t be priced the same as dolls that are still in their original box."

      "title": "Create a listing on an online marketplace.",
      "content": "Create a listing on an online marketplace. eBay is a popular site to sell Monster High dolls, but other options include Depop and Poshmark. Include clear, well-lit pictures of your dolls in the listing to attract buyers. Highlight any damage, stains, or other issues with them in your pictures and listing description. Finally, set a fair price based on the doll’s condition and market value—use your research as a guide."

    {
      "title": "Donate your collection if you’d rather not sell it.",
      "content": "Donate your collection if you’d rather not sell it. Maybe your dolls aren’t valuable enough to be worth selling. Or, perhaps you want a child to have a chance to enjoy playing with them instead of selling them to a collector. Whatever the reason, you can always donate your Monster High dolls to a local thrift store to quickly get them off your hands. If the dolls are damaged, missing parts, or otherwise in poor condition, you may not be able to donate them."
