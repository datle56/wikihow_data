      "title": "Determine the material of your shoes.",
      "content": "Determine the material of your shoes. Before you do any kind of cleaning, you’ll have to make sure that the product you use is safe for the shoe’s material. Leather, suede, canvas or synthetic fabrics will all require different treatment, especially when you’re using harsher cleaners. You’ll be able to tell easily between soft suede, leather and canvas, but if you’re not sure, look at the shoe box, search online for similar shoes or ask an attendant at a shoe store what the shoe is made of.

      "content": "Use toothpaste. To clean scuffs off of leather, patent leather, synthetic leather or rubber shoes, use toothpaste. Using a toothbrush and a dab of toothpaste, scrub the scuff marks. Apply a little water to help the toothpaste foam up, then continue scrubbing off the scuffs with circular movements. Rinse or wipe the toothpaste off, then dry the shoe. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Apply nail-polish remover.",
      "content": "Apply nail-polish remover. For real/synthetic/patent leather or rubber shoes, use a cotton ball and nail-polish remover. Make sure the nail-polish remover is non-acetone, as varieties with acetone can damage your shoes. Pour the polish remover into a small cup, then dip a cotton ball into it. Once the cotton ball is a bit damp, begin rubbing the remover over the scuff marks, rubbing until they’re gone. [3] X Research source"

Dip the toothbrush into the water and then into the baking soda, then scrub the scuffs. If it doesn’t lather enough, re-wet the brush and pour some baking soda directly onto the scuff, then scrub. Rinse or wipe away the baking soda when you’re finished. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Look for shoe-scuff products.",
      "content": "Look for shoe-scuff products. Shoe stores will often carry products specifically tailored to clean your shoes. They may work better than household items, as they are usually made for specific shoe fabrics. Make sure to use the correct one for your shoes, however, as using the wrong product could damage a different fabric. [7] X Research source Buy suede-specific products for suede. Suede can be difficult to take care of, and it scuffs very easily. Look for suede-specific cleaner, which comes in a spray bottle. Use it according to the directions and scrub out the scuffs. Buy a shoe brush. There are many types of shoe brushes for different shoe types. Suede and leather brushes are made to brush and protect scuffs off of suede and leather shoes, and will help give you a great finish. Suede brushes typically have a red, blue, or black handle. One side of the brush has small, finger-like sections of rubber, while the other side has brass bristles. [8] X Expert Source Penny Simmons Shoe Care Specialist Expert Interview. 19 November 2020."

Some scuffs and marks are easier to clean off if you catch them early and often, so shoe wipes can be a convenient way to get rid of them quickly. Make sure to buy the correct type for the material of your shoe."

Using a soft rag, buff a little bit of shoe polish over the entire surface of the shoe. Pay close attention to the locations of the scuffs and give them a little extra polish.

You’ll be less likely to scuff a pair of nice, leather shoes if you only wear them to work, not to a concert or sporting event. Keep a pair of older shoes handy and wear them when you know they might get dirty."
