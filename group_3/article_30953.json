A synchronicity is the occurrence of two or more events that seem related to each other, even though there is no causal connection between them. In other words, it’s like a noticeable or important coincidence. For example, you might be thinking about making a major change in your life when you see 08:08 on the clock, which symbolizes life changes. [27] X Research source These mirror numbers are placed in your path by your guardian angels to reassure you that you’re on the right path or to offer you guidance along your way.

      "title": "The message of mirror numbers comes from the energies of digits 0 to 9.",
      "content": "The message of mirror numbers comes from the energies of digits 0 to 9. For example, since number 2 represents duality and balance, mirror number 02:02 is a sign to balance your needs with someone else’s in a partnership. Since each digit in a mirror number is reflected and appears twice, the energy of those numbers is doubled. [30] X Research source Mirror numbers can also be reduced to a single digit which also contributes its vibrations to the overall message of the mirror number. For example, in 02:02, 0+2+0+2=4, so the number 4 (representing stability and solid foundations) is also important to interpreting 02:02’s meaning. If a mirror number reduces to a double digit number (for example, 17:17 reducing to 16), continue reducing until you get a single digit (1+6=7). The exception is when a mirror number reduces to a Master Number ( 11 , 22 , or 33 ). In that case, do not reduce any further."

In either case, the universe is asking you to adjust to stay on track. Maybe you’re close to your goal and just need to be more optimistic, or perhaps you have a draining relationship to cut off before you can make progress. Set aside some alone time to think about what you want in life and how you can get it. What’s standing in your way that you need to address? Stay open-minded about opportunities for growth and change. You never know what the route to success looks like until you’re on it! [31] X Research source Think about the bigger meaning behind the changes you’re making. For example, are you cutting back on drinking just to save calories and money, or is it so you have more time and energy to devote to your creative goals?"
