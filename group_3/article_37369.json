Whether it’s from a parent, a sibling, a partner, a friend, or a colleague, identify that any rude or hurtful comment is toxic. [1] X Expert Source Jay Reid, LPCC Licensed Professional Clinical Counselor Expert Interview. 7 August 2020. Triangulation mainly involves praising other people to put you down. Tell yourself that it says more about the person who said it and has nothing to do with you. [2] X Research source A parent with narcissistic tendencies might say, “Amber always gets straight A’s. I’m so amazed by her! I wish you tried a little harder.” A partner with narcissistic tendencies may say something like, “My ex was so gorgeous and intelligent. I really miss the energy he brought to my life.” A friend with narcissistic tendencies might claim, “I invited the whole crew to karaoke! It was a blast.” A colleague with narcissistic tendencies may make a remark like, “Can you believe they still don’t know how to turn on the projector?! It’s so simple!”"

      "content": "Play it cool to prove their words don’t have power over you. Even if you’re frustrated, keep a neutral expression and relaxed body language. Look at them and tell yourself, “This isn’t worth reacting to.” If they raise their voice or continue their disrespectful conversation, breathe in softly and exhale. The more grounded you are, the more they’ll realize that you won’t be their target. [3] X Research source If you feel you want to defend yourself, think of a friend you can confide in later. [4] X Expert Source Jay Reid, LPCC Licensed Professional Clinical Counselor Expert Interview. 7 August 2020.

      "content": "Being assertive may prevent them from manipulating you in the future. Pause, take a moment to consider what you want to say, then look them in the eyes. Keep your tone of voice respectful. Use simple, short phrases to point out that their style of communication isn’t healthy. As you express what you notice, they’ll sense that their strategies won’t work on you anymore. Here are some examples of graceful and assertive replies: [5] X Research source “It sounds like you want me to compete with Katie. My sister and I are different people, and I love that about us.” “I don’t think we should worry about who’s the favorite parent. Both of us should look out for the best interests of our kids.” “Fantasizing about other people doesn’t seem like it’d benefit our relationship. I want a partner who’s focused on me.”"

      "content": "Be clear about what you will and won't put up with. First, explain what you won't respond to, like name-calling or invasive questions. Then, bring up how there will be a consequence if they cross any boundary. Finally, check in with yourself and remind yourself that this person’s narcissistic traits are rooted in fear and insecurity, which is what causes them to lash out. This three-step process to protect yourself might look like: [6] X Research source \"I'm not comfortable with you asking about my salary or how I spend my money.\" \"If you continue to pry about my finances, I will need to distance myself from you.\" \"I recognize that they are so critical of me because it distracts them from their own insecurities.\""

Maybe you have common interests or you just know what they’re really into. Also feel free to throw in a random curveball, like a piece of trivia. Because they were focused on their own “game,” they won’t expect the sudden shift. They’ll probably even lose track of what they were saying if you make a comment like: [7] X Research source “Anyway, did you know they’re opening a new museum downtown?” “Hey, I’ve been wondering… how are your tennis lessons going?” “Speaking of finances… did you know money isn’t really made out of paper?”"

      "content": "They can't drain your energy if you make a quick exit. Look at your texts, tell them you have to step outside to take a phone call, or let them know that you already have something on your calendar. Make it sound urgent or time-sensitive so they can’t keep you up. Give a polite goodbye, then head out. [8] X Research source As soon as you’re feeling tired or uncomfortable, use this trick so you can leave. They’ll realize that you have other people, projects, or events in your life.

[13] X Research source Delete all of their contact info and block them on all platforms. Avoid any explanations—otherwise, they may try to talk you out of your choice.
