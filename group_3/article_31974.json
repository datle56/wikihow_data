      "content": "Always be prepared. When you find yourself in a group situation at school or work, be prepared to exchange pleasantries. For example, someone may ask if you're doing anything interesting over the weekend. This is a great opportunity to share something about yourself and, at the same time, extend the conversation and show interest in what she has to say. When you go into a new social situation, try to have an idea or two in your back pocket of something interesting you can bring up but not in a showy way. Don’t rehearse what you’re going to say. If you try to verbatim remember something you practiced, you might get flustered and embarrassed if you forget what you were going to say. When in doubt, ask her about herself. Girls love it when you show interest in them and really listen."

Try not to monopolize the conversation talking about yourself because she might not be interested in all the same topics as you. Ask her questions and show that you’re really listening by asking additional questions that build on what she just told you. For example, if she mentions going away with her parents for the weekend to their cottage, don’t start talking about the cottage you went to last weekend, but instead ask her more about the cottage or her parents. Respond appropriately. Don’t just make it 20 questions. If she asks about you, answer her."
