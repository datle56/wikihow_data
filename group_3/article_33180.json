      "content": "Choose one person to be the “host” and make the puzzle. One person will choose the word and draw the hangman. Other players will guess letters to try and identify the word the host picked. Every player can take turns being the host, or you can play multiple rounds with the same host. [1] X Research source The host must know how to spell the words they choose for each round."

      "title": "Pick the secret word if you’re the host.",
      "content": "Pick the secret word if you’re the host. The other players will need to guess your word letter by letter, so choose a word you think will be difficult to guess if you want to make things harder on them. Difficult words usually have uncommon letters, like “z,” or “j,” and only a few vowels. [2] X Research source For longer games, you can also choose phrases if everyone agrees it’s okay. If you’re playing with younger students, don’t choose a word they may not know. The host can give a hint or category like animal, vegetable, or movie star to make the game easier."

      "content": "Draw a blank line for each letter in the word. As the host, you’re the “executioner” in charge. So, let’s say you choose the word “zipper.” You’d draw 6 blanks with 1 spot for each letter ( _ _ _ _ _ _ ). Don’t tell anyone the secret word! [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Start guessing letters if you are the player.",
      "content": "Start guessing letters if you are the player. You can have each player take turns or have the players work together and choose letters as a group. Once the word has been chosen and the players know how many letters in the secret word, players begin guessing which letters are in the word. For example, you might begin by asking, “Is there an 'e' in your word?” [4] X Research source A lot of players like to start by guessing common letters, like vowels, or “s,” “t,” and “n.”"

      "title": "Fill the letter in the blanks if the players guess correctly.",
      "content": "Fill the letter in the blanks if the players guess correctly. Whenever a player guesses a letter that is in the secret word, the host fills in the relevant blank. For example, if the word is “zipper” and the players guess “e,” then the host will fill in the 5th blank with an “e:” (_ _ _ _ e _). [5] X Research source If the players guess a letter that repeats, fill in both letters. If they guess “p,” you would have to fill in both “p”s. ( _ _ p p e _ )."

      "title": "Draw part of the hangman when the players guess wrong.",
      "content": "Draw part of the hangman when the players guess wrong. Whenever a player guesses a letter that is not in the secret word, they get a strike that brings them closer to losing. To show this, the host draws a simple stick figure of a man being hung, adding a new part to the drawing with every wrong answer. This is also where you can adjust the difficulty of the game; the more marks you make, the more wrong guesses the players have. [6] X Research source The traditional order is: First wrong answer: Draw and upside-down \"L.\" This is the post the man hangs from. Second: Draw a circle for the “head” under the horizontal line of the “L.” Third: Draw a line down from the bottom of the head for the “body.” Fourth: Draw one arm out from the middle of his body for the “arm.” Fifth: Draw the other arm. Sixth: Draw one diagonal line from the bottom of the body for the first “leg.” Seventh: Draw the other leg. Eighth: Connect the head to the post with a “rope.” Once you draw the rope the players have lost the game."

      "content": "The players win when they guess the correct word. If the players get every letter of the word before the host finishes drawing then they win. At any point a player can try to guess the entire word instead of a single letter, but if they guess the wrong word then the host should treat it as if they guessed a wrong letter. [7] X Research source If the host ends up drawing the entire hangman, the players lose and the game is over. To make the game harder, make a rule saying that the players can only guess the secret word once before they lose. To make it easier, the host can reveal the first letter of the word, as well as any letters similar to the first one."

The rules are the same with one big exception: every other letter you guess should not be in the secret word. The player needs to alternate guessing letters that are in the word (the \"in\" round) and letters that are not in the word (the “out” round) until they win or lose. [10] X Research source If the player says a letter that is in the secret word the host writes it in regardless of the round the player is in. If they guess a letter that is in the word while on the “out” round, they still get a strike, however. To make this easier, the host can write out every letter of the alphabet and cross them out as they are eliminated."
