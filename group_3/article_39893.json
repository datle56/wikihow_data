      "content": "Keeping your head up improves sinus drainage during the night. If you're tossing and turning trying to get comfortable, stack a few pillows under your head to elevate it above the rest of your body. The best position when you have a stuffy nose is laying on your back with pillows holding your head up to drain the mucus more effectively. [1] X Research source This is a good preventative measure if you're prone to getting a stuffy nose at night due to acid reflux, dry air, or allergens around your bed. However, it'll also make breathing easier if you already have a stuffy nose!"

      "content": "Acupressure lets you activate pressure points to ease sinus discomfort. Press your left and right index fingers to either side of your nostrils at the base of your nose. Hold your fingers in place for at least 3 minutes, applying firm but gentle pressure. This simple acupressure move will relieve the congestion in your nose and help you feel less stuffed up as you get ready to sleep! If your stuffy nose persists, repeat as needed to release the pressure in your sinuses."

      "content": "Salt water can break up mucus and flush out the virus if you have a cold. Stir ½ tsp (2,500 mg) of salt into an 8 fluid ounces (240 mL) glass of warm water. Then, take a sip of the salt water and gargle it at the back of your throat before spitting it out. Continue gargling as needed to make your stuffy nose feel better! If your throat is sore in addition to the stuffy nose (which is common for people with a cold), a saltwater gargle will relieve the pain and make it easier to swallow. Kids under 6 years old should not try this method."

Set the water to be hot but not scalding, and be sure to close the bathroom door so that the steam gathers. Once the shower has been running for a few minutes, and the room is thoroughly steamed up, take several deep breaths to clear your nose. Alternatively, if you want the water extra hot to create a steamier environment, you can sit outside the shower and breathe as the steam gathers. [3] X Research source"

Capsaicin is found naturally in chili peppers (which are notoriously hot) and is capable of thinning the mucus in your nose, reducing the stuffiness. Therefore, eating salsa, hot sauce, curry, and other spicy foods that contain capsaicin can give you some welcome relief from your stuffy nose. Keep in mind that spicy food can also make your nose run more since capsaicin stimulates mucus secretion. If you have an upset stomach for any reason, it’s best to avoid spicy foods until you feel better. Spicy foods are also not advised if you’re treating symptoms caused by acid reflux , as they can make the condition worse."
