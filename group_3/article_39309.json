      "content": "Single-blade straight razors are made to shave off peach fuzz. When it comes to shaving your face, don’t reach for the same razor you use on your legs or underarms. Instead, get a face razor (also sometimes called an eyebrow razor) for a close, clean shave. These razors are made to shave your face, so they’re less irritating for your skin. [4] X Research source You can typically find these in multi-packs for under $5. Always use a new razor when shaving your face. Using a dull razor can cause irritation and make your skin break out. If you have sensitive skin, consider using an electric face razor instead. It won’t give you as close of a shave, but it will irritate your skin less."

      "content": "Use a shaving gel to help the razor glide over your skin. While it’s possible to shave your face dry, shaving gel helps reduce irritation and prevent nicks.

      "title": "Pulling your skin taut helps the razor glide over it smoothly.",
      "content": "Pulling your skin taut helps the razor glide over it smoothly. The goal is to create a smooth base, preventing razor nicks and making the roots of the hairs easy to access. Press your fingers gently but firmly into your skin to pull it flat across your bone structure. Direct your skin up and towards the outside of your face, rather than down or toward the center. [6] X Research source If you’re shaving along your upper lip, for instance, you can press your upper lip against or around your teeth to stretch and smooth out that part of skin. Or, if you’re shaving your sideburns, place your fingers just above the area you’ll be shaving and pull that part of skin up and back in the direction of your ear."

      "title": "Keep the razor angled to avoid cutting your skin.",
      "content": "Keep the razor angled to avoid cutting your skin. Hold the razor in your other hand, and angle it slightly so it’s not flat against your face. Shave with the direction that your hair grows, which is usually down toward your chin. This will help avoid irritation or ingrown hairs later on. [7] X Research source For spots with especially coarse hairs, like your upper lip, you can switch to shaving against the grain for a closer shave. Just keep in mind that it may put you at risk for ingrown hairs."

      "title": "Work in small sections and press gently on your skin.",
      "content": "Work in small sections and press gently on your skin. Keeping your skin pulled taut and the razor at a 45-degree angle, work in a series of short, gentle strokes to cut the hairs away. Pass over each spot just a few times to get all of the hairs. Avoid going over one spot more than 3 or 4 times as you might irritate your skin. [8] X Research source These light, short strokes are different from the long, continuous strokes that you might use to shave your legs, so it may take some getting used to. Practice makes perfect!"

      "title": "Wipe off hair to make sure your razor is clean.",
      "content": "Wipe off hair to make sure your razor is clean. A clogged razor makes for a duller shave. After every couple of strokes, wipe your razor off on a clean towel or rag. That way, your razor stays sharp the entire time you’re shaving. [9] X Research source You can also rinse your razor with running water."

      "content": "Splash your face with warm water to remove any loose hairs. You can follow up with a damp washcloth to gently wipe away any leftover shaving gel or oil as well. Gently massage your skin, but be careful not to harshly rub or irritate it. [10] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source A side effect of shaving is that dead skin will sometimes come up along with the hairs. This can leave your skin looking and feeling soft and renewed, but it will also be tender and prone to irritation."

      "title": "Hydrate your skin",
      "content": "Hydrate your skin to avoid dryness and irritation. Shaving your face can sometimes make your skin feel a bit dry or tight. Combat this by massaging a hydrating lotion into your skin right after you shave to soothe and rehydrate your face. [11] X Research source If you use any face products that contain acid or retinol, skip those for now. Acids and retinoids can cause irritation to freshly shaved skin. Planning to go outside? Use an SPF 30 or above sunscreen to protect your skin. Shaved skin is a little more sensitive to the sun, meaning it could get burned easier."

      "content": "Witch hazel naturally cools and soothes the skin. It’s optional, but if your skin is burning, itching, or has a cut, pour some witch hazel extract onto a cotton pad and lightly rub it onto your skin. Let the witch hazel dry for a few minutes to feel instant relief. [12] X Research source You can also apply aloe vera to your skin to help with razor burn."
