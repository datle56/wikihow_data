It’s possible that double-jointed people will be able to get out of this trick, so you can ask the volunteer first if he or she is double-jointed."

      "content": "Ask the volunteer to fold their middle fingers down. Have the person fold the middle finger on both hands down, so that each one is resting on the back of the opposite hand. The middle fingers should be folded down as one would when interlacing the fingers. However, all other fingers (thumbs, pointer fingers, ring fingers, and pinky fingers) should remain unfolded with fingertips touching. Try an alternative if you wish, which has only the ring fingers up, with all other fingers folded down. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Place a coin between the ring fingertips and ask them to move each finger. Place a coin of any kind between your volunteer’s two ring finger tips. Then ask them to separate each pair of fingertips, with the ring fingers holding the coin last. Have the volunteer separate their thumbs. They should be able to easily. Have the volunteer separate their pointer fingers. They should be able to easily. Have the volunteer separate their pinky fingers. They should be able to easily. Then have the volunteer separate their ring fingers, with the goal of letting the coin drop. They will likely struggle to move their ring fingers apart at all."

      "content": "Enjoy the confused and amazed look of your volunteer and friends. See the shocked or frustrated face of your volunteer when he or she can’t move their ring fingers, which is surprising to most people because they can move all of their other fingers easily. You can tell others that this trick occurs because the tendons in the hand that control the fingers are separate from one another, except for the middle and ring finger, which are controlled by the same tendon. So when one is folded down, the other can’t be lifted. If your volunteer is able to separate their fingers enough to drop the coin, try placing a bigger object between the fingers. Also make sure that your volunteer’s middle fingers stay completely folded down to prevent them from getting out of the lock. You can even hold these fingers down for them. You can also place something between the subject’s palms to help keep the fingers folded down and make the trick more difficult. Use an object like a thin book, a small rock, or even your own hands."

Enjoy the surprise and amusement of your volunteer and other guests. Have others try the same trick themselves if they don’t believe it. Try on both right and left hands as well. You can tell your audience that the trick works because the middle and ring finger are controlled by the same tendon in the hand, so one cannot easily be lifted when the other is folded. The other fingers are controlled by separate tendons so they can be moved independently. Make sure that anyone trying the trick keeps their middle finger folded under and that this finger and all other fingertips remain flat on the table."

      "content": "Grab your opponent’s wrist. Secure either of your opponent’s wrists when grappling to begin the finger lock. Make this move when grappling rather than striking, as both of your hands will be occupied with this move, leaving you open for a strike. It is typical to secure the wrist with your non-dominant hand, as you will want to perform the finger lock itself with your dominant hand."

Bend fingers so that they are hyperextended outside their range of motion. Lock fewer fingers (just one or two) to make this move more painful, and thereby more effective for subduing an opponent. Try pulling the fingers backward toward the knuckles, or bending and twisting them sideways."

Curl the thumb as much as possible and pin the tip of the thumbnail down tightly against the palm for the greatest effect. Perform the thumb compression if you cannot grab the other fingers, or the thumb is more accessible to you."
