      "content": "Thread the yarn on a blunt darning needle. Pull out yarn from the skein you used to knit the pieces. Measure the length of the knit pieces you'll be stitching together and pull out 3 times that length. Cut the yarn and thread it through a blunt needle so that 4 inches (10 cm) are pulled through the eye to keep the yarn in place. For example, if you'll need to sew a 5-inch (12-cm) length, thread a 15-inch (36-cm) strand of yarn onto the needle."

You don't need to pull the yarn tightly to keep the 2 knit pieces touching, since you'll tighten them later. [2] X Research source The 2 knit pieces can be up to 1-inch (2.5-cm) apart while you're doing the mattress (invisible) stitch."

This gap will be between the edge and second-to-last row you knitted. Insert the needle below 2 of the horizontal bars near the bottom of the piece and pull the yarn up and through. [3] X Research source Avoid pulling the yarn tightly to bring the 2 knit pieces closely together. For a tighter seam, you could insert the needle under 1 of the horizontal bars instead of 2.
