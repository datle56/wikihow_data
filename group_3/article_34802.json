In the spirit of Christmas, there’s nothing better than having all your family and friends gathered around a Christmas tree and enjoying each other’s company. To create this atmosphere, the tree needs to act as a focal point in an area that everyone can gather around. [2] X Research source Corners work really well as locations for Christmas trees as everyone can group around them and have the tree in the middle."

      "content": "Move any furniture that may be in the way. It’s normal not to have room for a Christmas tree with all your furniture out so you may have to move some of it around. Consider arranging your couches or chairs in a different formation or even just removing some if there are too many. Get some friends round one day and experiment with what arrangement works best for you. Don’t be afraid to remove furniture completely if you need to. Often people are more than happy to sit on the ground and other places during Christmas time! [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Put up a small fence to keep your pets away. This is really important to ensure that not only your pet is safe, but your tree as well. Pets can get very curious when something new like a Christmas tree gets put up and if your pets are large enough, they may easily be able to knock it over. This is not only a huge risk for everything around the tree but also your pet. Putting up a small fence to keep your pets out is the easiest way to keep them out. You can buy these from any major pet goods store."

      "content": "Remove the tree from its packaging. There will be several pieces of equipment in the box and the best way to get your bearings is to lay all the bits and pieces out on the ground. If there are plastic bags of little nuts or bolts, tear a small hole so you have easy access when you need them. It can also be a good idea to check the list of what the box is supposed to contain just so you can check that everything is there. This will save you a lot of time if you happen to be missing anything. [4] X Research source"

Each tree will vary slightly in the exact instructions of how to put together the base, but if you follow them exactly, your base will be set up in no time. As a general rule, the base should form an ‘X’ shape when it has been spread out and correctly put together. [5] X Research source"

The “trunk” will be split into several sections represented by letters ‘A’ through whatever the last section is labeled. ‘A’ always represents the top of the tree so find the section that is furthest from ‘A’. The longest section will also generally be the largest and most bushy so if you’re having trouble differentiating between the sections, find the largest one. [6] X Research source"

Make sure each section is securely fastened in before you attempt to put another one on top. [8] X Research source For example, if the bottom section of the trunk is labeled 'D' then the next section you attach is 'C' and so on. The branches get smaller and smaller with each section until you finally reach the top."

One technique when fluffing is to separate the wires evenly with your hands, and work from the bottom up.

You can use lights, globes, confetti, and even a star or an angel at the top. [10] X Research source Looking online is a great place to start if you are struggling to find inspiration! For a more balanced look, add large ornaments first, then medium and small ones. Mixing ornament sizes creates a more professional and visually appealing tree."
