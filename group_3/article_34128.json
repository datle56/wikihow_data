This will signal to birds that the glass is there and prevent them from flying into it.

Always place decals very close together, about 1 hand’s distance away from each other. You will need to cover the windows with a pattern of decals, as 1 to 2 bird decals on the window will not deter birds.

      "content": "Apply soap or window paint to the outside of the windows. Another way to deter birds from hitting your windows is to put a layer of soap on the outside of windows, creating a film that will be visible to birds. Keep in mind that with this method, you may have to soap the windows several times a week to maintain the film. [5] X Research source Another option is to apply window paint or tempera paints to the windows. You can make this a fun art project and create bold, bright patterns with the window paint. Make sure you cover most to all of the surface area of the windows with paint so there are no clear or transparent areas that birds can fly into."

      "content": "Put a film on the outside of your windows. There are window films available that are transparent on the inside but opaque on the outside. Use a film that covers the entire surface of the glass on the outside. Most window films are made to allow light inside while still appearing opaque and reflective to birds. [6] X Research source Some films also come in patterns, such as stripes or blocks, that can help to deter birds from flying into the glass. Applying patterned films can create an interesting look for your windows while also safeguarding them for birds."

You can then close the shutters when you are out for the day to prevent birds from hitting the glass.

      "content": "Switch out the glass for ultraviolet, patterned glass. For a permanent solution, you can switch out your window glass for ultraviolet, patterned glass. This glass has crisscross patterns that are not noticeable to humans but are visible to birds from the outside. Though this may be the most expensive option, it is also the most permanent one. [9] X Research source You can find ultraviolet, patterned window glass online or in specialty home and furniture stores. If you are planning to install windows in your home, you should go for slightly tilted windows. Ask the contractor to position the windows so they are slightly vertical, facing downward. This will allow the window surface to reflect the ground rather than the sky and the trees. Positioning your windows this way will help to deter birds from hitting the glass without obstructing your view. [10] X Research source"

Keeping them too far away from the windows will allow birds to accelerate more if they decide to fly into a window, creating a more dangerous impact. [14] X Trustworthy Source The Cornell Lab of Ornithology Research lab of Cornell University dedicated to interpreting and conserving the Earth's biological diversity through research and education about birds Go to source To minimize deadly impacts as much as possible, look for feeders that you can attach directly to the glass. You can also reduce the changes of window impacts by placing feeders and baths more than 30 feet (9.1 m) away from your window.
