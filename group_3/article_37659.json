      "content": "Place the cantaloupe in a brown paper bag. Get out a brown paper bag that is large enough to fit the cantaloupe: ensure the melon has enough space for airflow and isn’t squeezed too tightly in the bag. Then, close the top of the bag. [1] X Research source The closed paper bag traps the ethylene gas that the cantaloupe produces as it ripens. The production of ethylene gas increases in the presence of additional ethylene gas, so keeping the gas concentrated within the bag speeds up the ripening process. Do not use a plastic bag in place of a paper bag. Paper bags are porous, so carbon dioxide can escape and oxygen can enter. Plastic bags prevent airflow, which can cause the cantaloupe to ferment. Note: Cantaloupe does not ripen once it is picked off the vine . The sweetness will not change since its flesh does not contain starches capable of converting to sugars. However, the texture, color, and juiciness of the fruit can improve, so this process is still beneficial if you have a freshly harvested mature melon or one that is only slightly unripe.

      "content": "Place a banana or apple in the bag to speed up ripening. Adding a ripe banana or ripe apple to the bag produces even more ethylene gas, which can help the cantaloupe ripen even faster. Bananas and apples produce notably high amounts of ethylene gas once they ripen, which makes them better options than other fruits. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Leave the melon on your counter at room temperature for 1 to 2 days. It typically takes a few days for cantaloupe to soften and get juicier. Just check on your melon every day and gently squeeze it to see if it feels ripe. Then, cut it when it’s at your desired ripeness. [4] X Research source Personal chef Markeicha Dulaney agrees that if your melon isn't ripe yet, simply keep it out on your counter for up to 2 days. Make sure that the place you store the melon is neither excessively cold or excessively hot. Avoid areas that are heavy in moisture or particularly drafty, too."

      "content": "Place cut cantaloupe in the fridge for 2 to 3 days to soften. Like uncut cantaloupe, cut cantaloupe won’t ripen and get sweeter, but it can get softer and juicier. Simply place your cut cantaloupe in an airtight storage container and stick it in the fridge for 2 to 3 days to help it soften and get juicy. If your cantaloupe is still hard and tastes plain , stick it in a fruit smoothie , eat it on top of yogurt, or grill it. Or, make jam with the cantaloupe."

      "title": "Check if there is a stem on one end.",
      "content": "Check if there is a stem on one end. If you are purchasing a cantaloupe instead of harvesting one from your own garden, first verify that no part of the actual stem is on the melon. If it is, you might want to find a different melon, since this suggests that the cantaloupe was harvested before it was able to fully mature on the vine. A cantaloupe like that will never ripen. [5] X Research source Check the rind around the stem end of the cantaloupe, too. If there are any tears in the rind, those could also suggest that the fruit was picked too early. Make sure that the stem end is slightly indented since this indicates that it was easily plucked off the vine. If the stem end protrudes, that could be another sign of a premature harvest. Also avoid selecting a cantaloupe that has a very soft stem end with moist spots around it. That suggests that the fruit is overripe."

      "title": "Look for a raised netting pattern on the cantaloupe’s skin.",
      "content": "Look for a raised netting pattern on the cantaloupe’s skin. A ripe cantaloupe’s rind is covered in a thick, coarse netting. It typically appears well-defined over the entire surface of the melon. [6] X Research source That netting can, however, stand out more easily in some areas than it does in others. Do not expect it to be perfectly uniform throughout."

      "title": "Look for a light golden color.",
      "content": "Look for a light golden color. Most ripe cantaloupes have a rind that’s tinted gold, yellow, or tan. If the rind is green, it is likely underripe. [7] X Research source"

      "title": "Press the bottom of the melon to see if there’s a slight give.",
      "content": "Press the bottom of the melon to see if there’s a slight give. Gently press on the blossom end of the cantaloupe, which is the opposite end from the stem end. If the melon is ripe, the end will yield slightly to your touch. If the end feels hard, it’s not fully ripe, so allow it to ripen at room temperature for another day or so. [8] X Research source On the other hand, if the cantaloupe gives too much or feels mushy, the fruit is likely overripe. Pick up the cantaloupe, too. Ripe melons feel firm and heavy for their size."

      "title": "Sniff the cantaloupe for a fruity and musky smell.",
      "content": "Sniff the cantaloupe for a fruity and musky smell. Take a whiff of the fruit at its blossom end, rather than at the stem end. Ripe cantaloupes have a sweet, fruity, and musky fragrance that gives them their characteristic smell. Simply keep the \"button\" of the fruit just below your nose when you inhale the melon’s scent. [9] X Research source If you are unfamiliar with the smell of a cantaloupe, simply sniff for a notably sweet scent. If you can’t smell anything yet, let the cantaloupe ripen for another half a day or so. The blossom end is where the softening begins and the aroma first develops, so the scent is usually the strongest and easily noticed there."

      "title": "Check the cantaloupe once the color changes from green to yellow.",
      "content": "Check the cantaloupe once the color changes from green to yellow. Never harvest a cantaloupe when the outer rind is still green, since this usually means the melon is unripe. Once the cantaloupe changes to a tan or yellow color, though, it is probably ripe. [10] X Research source Feel the surface of the cantaloupe, too. If the netting is rough and coarse, it is likely ripe. [11] X Research source Do not harvest the cantaloupe based solely on color. While a green cantaloupe is definitely unripe, a yellow or tan cantaloupe may not be fully ripe yet—there are other signs to check for ripeness. Even if the melon is not quite ripe, noting the color will give you an idea of whether or not the fruit is close to being ripe. Note: You must allow the cantaloupe to mature completely on the vine. Unlike other fruits, melons do not develop any sugars once they are harvested, so the cantaloupe will not become any sweeter after you remove it from the vine. The color and texture may change afterward, but the taste will not. [12] X Research source"

      "title": "Look for a crack around the stem.",
      "content": "Look for a crack around the stem. The melon is usually ready to harvest when it is \"full slip.\" This means that there is a small crack that completely encircles the stem where it is attached to the cantaloupe. [13] X Research source If you aren't sure whether or not the crack is deep or complete enough, test it by applying pressure to the side of the stem. Place your thumb directly next to the stem and apply pressure to the side of the stem. You should only need to use a little force, and the stem should begin to separate easily."

      "title": "Gently twist the melon off the vine to harvest it.",
      "content": "Gently twist the melon off the vine to harvest it. As soon as the color is right and the crack around the stem is complete, the cantaloupe is ripe. Simply give it a gentle twist to break it off of the vine. [14] X Research source Do not wait too long to harvest a ripe cantaloupe. If the melon falls off the vine on its own, it has likely become overripe, and both the taste and texture will be distorted as a result. If you’re growing cantaloupe , it typically takes 35 to 45 days for the melon to mature and ripen once the plant flowers. [15] X Research source"

If you’re not ready to cut and eat your cantaloupe once it’s ripe, simply stick it in the refrigerator until you plan to use it. This helps keep it fresh and tasty, as cantaloupe can spoil if kept at room temperature for too long. [16] X Research source If you harvested cantaloupe from your garden, it typically stays fresh in the fridge for 5 to 15 days. [17] X Research source Note : Wash the cantaloupe's rind before cutting it to remove any bacteria and dirt on the surface. Simply hold the cantaloupe under cool, running water and scrub it with a vegetable brush. Then, pat the melon dry with a clean cloth or paper towel."

After about 1 to 2 hours, transfer the frozen cantaloupe into a plastic freezer bag or storage container.
