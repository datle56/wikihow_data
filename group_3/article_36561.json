Rinse the cleanser away with cool water, then pat your face dry with a soft cloth. [1] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Opthamologists Professional medical organization focused on advocating for public health and supporting sight-related research Go to source The best time to wash your face is in the evening before going to bed. You can also wash in the morning, especially if your dermatologist recommends it. Alternatively, you might just use lukewarm water and a clean cloth to gently wipe your face in the morning. Be gentle when washing your face, especially if the milia is caused by an injury or sun exposure. Milia may also be caused by the long-term use of steroid creams or ointments, a symptom of a genetic condition, or an autoimmune response.

      "content": "Use steam to soften your skin after washing your face. If you showered, let the steam build up in your bathroom and hang out in there for 5-10 minutes. Or, fill the sink with hot water, lean your face over it, and drape a towel over your head for 5-10 minutes. [3] X Research source Milia aren’t caused by clogged pores, but letting the steam open your pores may make it easier to exfoliate dead skin cells covering the milia. Steam also softens your skin, which makes exfoliating a bit easier."

      "content": "Exfoliate under your eyes with a warm, damp, soft cloth once every other day. After you’re done with your steam treatment, run a clean cloth under warm water and squeeze out the excess. Gently rub the area under your eyes gently for 1-2 minutes, using a circular motion and light pressure. Rinse your face with cool water, then pat it dry with a clean towel. [4] X Research source Don’t rub so hard that you cause redness or discomfort. Your goal is to remove dead skin cells from the area of the milia, not to try to rub the milia off. Exfoliate once every other day, unless your dermatologist recommends doing so more or less frequently."

      "content": "Apply a natural remedy like honey or rose water , if desired. Both honey and rose water have antimicrobial properties and may potentially encourage milia to disappear more quickly. [5] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source For a simple honey mask, apply a small amount of honey beneath your eyes, let it sit for 15 minutes, then wipe it away completely with lukewarm water and a soft cloth.

[9] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source None of these ingredients have been proven to remove milia, but they possess anti-inflammatory properties and may help make your skin softer. For a rose water face mask, mix together spoonfuls of plain yogurt and honey, then stir in a few drops of rose water. As with a plain honey face mask, leave it on your face for 15 minutes before wiping it away. These masks have not been scientifically proven to help get rid of milia specifically, but both honey and rosewater may help hydrate and soften your skin.

If you want to hide the milia while you treat them, use a lightweight, hypoallergenic makeup that won’t clog your pores or cake over your skin cells. Remove the makeup completely when you wash your face in the evening. [12] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Small amounts of concealing makeup likely won’t impact how long the milia will last. Caking on heavy amounts of makeup may cause the milia to stick around longer, though."

      "content": "Avoid picking, poking, or trying to remove milia, especially near your eyes. You can’t “pop” milia like pimples (which is a bad habit anyway), and trying to do so may break the skin and cause an infection or scarring. Trying to remove milia yourself with a sharp instrument is especially dangerous if the milia are anywhere near your eyes: the risk of injuring your eye is simply too great to risk. [13] X Research source It’s always safer to have a doctor remove milia than trying to do it yourself. Even if you properly sterilize your tools to reduce the risk of infection, there’s still a chance you’ll cause scarring."

      "content": "Treat milia with prescribed topical retinoids. Talk to a dermatologist about the option of treating the milia with topical retinoids. Topical means a cream or a gel that you put on top of your skin, rather than a medicine that you ingest. If your doctor prescribes topical retinoids, you will most likely have to apply the retinoid to the milia every day for several weeks. [15] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Retinoid is the active form of vitamin A. Keep in mind that this is purely cosmetic, since milia aren’t actually harmful, so you could just wait for them to go away. Your doctor may also prescribe tretinoin cream, which is similar to retinoid, except that retinoid is naturally derived from vitamin A, while tretinoin is synthetic.

      "content": "Undergo “deroofing” or similar mechanical removal techniques. Your primary care doctor or dermatologist will likely remove milia using a process called “deroofing.” They’ll create a tiny slice in your skin right next to each milia, then use a comedone extractor and/or tweezers to draw and pull the milia out through the skin opening. This is one of the safest milia removal procedures: you'll likely only feel a prick, and the healing process will be quick.

      "content": "Discuss alternate treatments like cryotherapy or laser ablation. Milia can, in some cases, be removed using methods other than manual extraction. Doctors are less likely to approve these treatments when the milia are near your eyes, out of concern for any accidents that may cause eye damage. Alternate treatments may include: [19] X Research source Cryotherapy , in which the milia are frozen off with a small, specialized tool. Your skin is likely to heal without scarring within a couple weeks after cryotherapy. Simply wash and apply a bit of petroleum jelly to the treated area every day. [20] X Research source Laser ablation , which essentially “zaps” the milia away with a targeted beam of light. Recovery from laser ablation usually takes a few weeks. Apply sunscreen to the treated area every day and keep the area heavily moisturized.

      "content": "Leave milia alone if they don’t bother you physically or emotionally. Unless they get infected, most likely due to you scratching or picking at them, milia are completely harmless physically. Therefore, leaving them alone is nearly always the appropriate medical recommendation. They’ll usually go away on their own within 2 weeks to 6 months. [22] X Trustworthy Source MedlinePlus Collection of medical information sourced from the US National Library of Medicine Go to source However, if having prominent milia under your eyes (or elsewhere) is causing you emotional distress, it’s reasonable to have them removed for your own wellbeing.

      "content": "Don’t worry about milia on newborns or infants. Roughly half of all babies develop at least some milia on their faces during their first 6 months of life. It’s not clear exactly why this happens, but it’s completely normal and nearly always completely harmless. The milia will almost certainly go away on their own by around 6 months of age. [23] X Trustworthy Source MedlinePlus Collection of medical information sourced from the US National Library of Medicine Go to source Never try to remove milia from a baby yourself, and don’t expect to find a legitimate doctor who will do so either. The only reason a doctor might consider removing milia is if they are red, swollen, and possibly infected. There's a difference between neonatal milia and acne: acne presents as small red bumps or pustules and shows up a few weeks after birth, while milia is small white bumps present at birth.

Proper skin care may also reduce your risk of acne and more serious conditions like skin cancer. In addition to an under-eye cleaning, steaming, and exfoliating routine, take steps like: [25] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Opthamologists Professional medical organization focused on advocating for public health and supporting sight-related research Go to source Applying sunscreen whenever you go outdoors. Wearing a broad-brimmed hat to keep the sun off your face. Removing makeup thoroughly at bed time.
