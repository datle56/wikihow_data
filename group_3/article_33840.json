      "content": "The Liturgy of the Hours is the daily prayer of the Catholic Church. By praying throughout the day at set intervals, the Liturgy of the Hours is a way for Christians to follow St. Paul’s exhortation to “pray without ceasing” (1 Thess. 5:17). The Liturgy of the Hours is also called the Divine Office. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "There are 7 hours in the Liturgy of the Hours, or times to pray. These hours are broken up into the 3 major hours, and the 4 minor ones. The goal of the Liturgy of the Hours is to unite everyone in the Catholic Church—all clergy are committed to praying the major hours, and are encouraged to pray 1 or 2 minor hours as well. [2] X Research source Even though the Liturgy of the Hours is required for clergy and others living a consecrated life, laypeople can also benefit a lot from the practice. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Set aside 3 times a day to pray. Although the timing for each of the hours in the divine office is not strict, it can help you form a routine to pray at the same time each day. Keep in mind that the major hours may take you longer to pray than the minor hours—set aside 15-20 minutes for each hour. Although you can adjust this schedule as you need, the general timing for each of the major hours is as follows: The Office of Readings : Can be prayed at any time of day, but normally prayed immediately before the Office of Morning Prayer. You may also choose to do this prayer at night, before you sleep. [4] X Research source The Office of Morning Prayer : Also known as Lauds, it is generally prayed at around daybreak, or 6 a.m. If waking up early is difficult for you, you can also pray this office the night before. The Office of Evening Prayer : Also referred to as Vespers, it is normally prayed at sunset, or around 6 p.m."

There are two options for a physical breviary: the single-volume Christian Prayer and the four-volume Liturgy of the Hours. [5] X Research source If you’re using a physical breviary, it’s important to have a guidebook to help you find the proper prayers for the day. Your church may have a guidebook for you to follow, or you can pick up a copy of the Saint Joseph Guide for the Liturgy of the Hours. If you’d prefer the convenience of a digital breviary, consider downloading a smartphone app or visiting a website like iBreviary ."

Regardless of which office you choose to start with, recite the following invitatory: [7] X Research source Begin by saying, “Lord open our lips, and we shall praise your name.” Say the antiphon: “The Lord is the king of martyrs: come, let us adore him, alleluia.” Then, recite Psalm 94 (95) (“Come, let us rejoice in the Lord…”) If you’re praying with others, repeat the antiphon after every verse. If you’re by yourself, just once at the beginning is okay."

If you’re praying two hours back to back at the beginning of the day—like the Office of Readings and the Office of Morning Prayer—there’s no need to recite the opening versicle before the second prayer, since the Invitatory will stand in for your opening. Recite the opening versicle as follows: [8] X Research source Start by saying, “O, God, come to our aid: O Lord make haste to help us.” Recite the “Glory Be”: “Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit. As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.” As you recite the prayer, bow your head when you say “Father,” “Son,” and “Holy Spirit.” [9] X Research source"

If you want to pray the minor hours at their traditional times, schedule them in each day at each of the following times: The Office of Midmorning Prayer : Known as Terce, this prayer normally occurs around 3 hours after sunrise, or 9 a.m. The Office of Midday Prayer : Called Sext, this prayer takes place around noon. The Office of Midafternoon Prayer : Also known as None, this prayer occurs around 3 p.m. The Office of Night Prayer : Also called Compline, this prayer happens before you sleep, or around 9 p.m."
