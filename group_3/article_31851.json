      "content": "Golf regulations only let you carry 14 clubs on the course, so a 14-way bag gives each one its own separate slot in the main compartment. Take your driver, woods, and putter and place them in the top slots closest to the bag’s handle. Going from left to right in the remaining slots, arrange your hybrid or iron clubs in ascending numerical order. Place your wedges in the last open slots from the lowest to the highest angle to keep them organized. [1] X Research source 14-way bags are normally called “cart” bags because they’re primarily used if you’re walking with a pull cart or driving a golf cart . Even though your putter is shorter than your driver, it’s one of the clubs you’ll use most frequently and will be easier to access at the top of your bag."

      "content": "With fewer slots in a 7- or 8-way bag, keep your driver and any woods in the top slot by the handle. Start adding the rest of your clubs to the remaining slots going left to right from the longest to the shortest. Group 2–3 hybrid clubs in the same slot, and keep your irons in ascending numerical order. Save an open slot near the top or bottom of your bag to store your putter separate from your other clubs. [2] X Research source Some 7- or 8-way bags have small slots along one side for individual clubs and wider openings that hold multiple clubs. Use the smaller slots for your driver, woods, and putter. Then, group together low-numbered irons, high-numbered irons, and wedges in the additional slots."

      "content": "Keep your putter as well as your longest clubs, like your driver and woods, in the back-most compartments by the handle so they’re easy to access. If you use hybrid clubs, group them together and put them in the next slot on the left side. Split your irons evenly between the next few slots, putting them in ascending numerical order from left to right. Use the front-most compartments for short clubs like your high-numbered irons and your wedges. If it’s hard to access your putter when it’s in the same compartment as your driver and woods, keep it in the same slot as your wedges instead."

      "content": "At the top compartment near the handle, store your driver, putter, and woods together. Keep your hybrids and high-numbered irons in the left compartment and your low-numbered irons on the right side. Place your 4 shortest clubs, like your wedges, in the last compartment at the bottom of your bag. Your driver, woods, and putter are the clubs you use the most, so keeping them in the top slot makes them easier to reach."

      "content": "Keep extra golf balls in the center pouch. Look for the large zippered ball pouch at the front of your golf bag. If you’re walking the course and carrying your bag, carry at least 5 golf balls with you. If you’re using a pull cart or golf cart, put in as many golf balls as you want since you don’t have to worry about lifting the extra weight. [3] X Research source Avoid putting golf balls in any other pockets because it will make your golf bag unbalanced and more difficult to carry."

Keep the bag in the same place as the golf balls so they’re easy to access.

Keep a small bottle of sunscreen in a separate bag so it doesn’t make a mess inside your golf bag. Choose a large pocket on the side of your bag or one of the pockets near the top of your bag.

Tuck in a few snacks, like protein bars or trail mix, next to the bottle. If there isn’t a water bottle holder, then use a front pocket on your golf bag for your snacks and drinks. [7] X Research source Throw away any snack wrappers in a trash can when you’re on the course rather than putting them back in your bag."

Keep your phone, wallet, keys, and any other valuables in the same pocket so they stay safe and are easy to access. [8] X Research source If you’re carrying a scorecard, put it in the same pocket. That way, it will stay dry and you’re able to quickly reach it after you finish a hole."

Secure the fastener so your glove hangs from the handle. Whenever you need to wear your glove, just take it off the handle and slip it on. [9] X Research source If you have extra gloves, keep them in their original package and place them in your golf bag’s large apparel pocket to limit their exposure to moisture and air. When you need to replace your old glove, then open up a new one."

Use a carabiner to clip the corner of the towel to your bag. That way, it’s within reach if you ever need to wipe off a club. [10] X Research source If the towel hangs down and touches the ground, fold it up and weave it between the heads of your golf clubs. The towel will stay clean and your clubs won’t rattle against each other."
