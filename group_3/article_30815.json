      "title": "Purchase soy or beeswax for your candle wax.",
      "content": "Purchase soy or beeswax for your candle wax. Soy waxes mix well with scents and colors and are often naturally composed from soybean oil, although some are mixed with the potentially toxic paraffin—always check the ingredients! Beeswax is completely natural, although it doesn't mix well with other fragrances. [1] X Research source If you have leftover wax from old jar candles, use a spoon to dig out the wax and divide them up by scent. Paraffin waxes are classic candle-making waxes that easily mix with other scents and colors. However, they are petroleum byproducts, meaning they are potentially toxic—avoid using these waxes whenever possible."

      "content": "Break up your wax into a bowl if it's not in pellet form. If you have larger pieces of wax, take a small, sharp knife and cut your wax up into pieces. Each piece should be about 1 inch (2.5 cm) wide or less. If you're wax is in pellet form, you can skip this step."

      "content": "Chop up 3 ounces (85 g) of crayon wax for color. If you want to add some color to your wax, use a cheese grater, pencil sharpener, or knife to create some shavings—enough to fill a 3 ounce (85 g) mason jar should be fine. [2] X Research source If you want, you can mix multiple colors."

      "title": "Find the flash and melting point of the wax you're using.",
      "content": "Find the flash and melting point of the wax you're using. Knowing the melting point of your wax before heating it will give you the best results. Never approach the flash point, as this is the temperature that the wax can combust if exposed to flame. [3] X Research source Beeswax has a melting point range of 144 to 147 °F (62 to 64 °C) and a flash point of 400 °F (204 °C). Soy wax melts within the 120 to 180 °F (49 to 82 °C) range depending on the specific blend. Flash points are variable—check the label or supplier. Paraffin wax melts above 99 °F (37 °C) and has a flash point of 390.2 °F (199.0 °C) without additives and 480.2 °F (249.0 °C) with additives."

Keep an eye on the temperature using a cooking thermometer and adjust the heat accordingly. Stir the wax using a wooden spoon every 1 minute or so. Break up any large chunks of wax with your spoon. [6] X Research source If the water in the large pot begins to evaporate, add more as needed. If your wax exceeds 340 °F (171 °C), remove it from heat until it falls back within the proper range."

      "content": "Add fragrances after your wax is melted. Gently pour the fragrance into your wax as it continues to heat. Stir it with your wooden spoon for approximately 30 seconds to distribute it evenly into your wax. [7] X Research source If you purchased wax that is specifically designed for candles, they should have instructions for that amount of fragrances required per 1 pound (0.45 kg) of wax. If your fragrance isn't mixing properly, try increasing the temperature to 365 °F (185 °C). For general wax products, 1 ounce (28 g) for each 1 pound (0.45 kg) is a safe bet."

[8] X Research source If you're using plastic, be sure to use containers that are marked as \"microwave-safe.\" Ceramic and glass dishes are usually fine, but you should still check for \"microwave-safe\" or \"heatproof\" labels on their packaging."

If not, place a dab of super glue on the bottom and attach the wick's metal tab to it. Hold the wick upwards for 2 to 3 minutes to give the glue time to set and ensure it dries in the proper position. [12] X Research source If you'd like, you can use your melted wax to adhere the wick to the container."

If your wick is swaying in the wax and not standing up straight, place two pencils horizontally on top of the container and secure the wick in between them. The wick doesn't have to be completely secured—just enough to stay in place while the wax sets. [14] X Research source Be sure to secure your wick if it's off-center—letting it set in this position means it won't burn properly."

Once it has completely set, reheat the leftover wax and add some of it to the top of the candle—just enough to fill the sinkhole. Once the hole is filled, stop pouring the wax—too much will create another sinkhole. [15] X Research source For the best wax setting, leave your candle out set overnight at room temperature."
