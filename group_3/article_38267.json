It's usually best not to go into more detail unless they ask. Here are some other formal options: \"I'm sorry, I've already committed that time. Thanks for considering me.\" \"Thank you for considering me, but I have a previous engagement.\" Unfortunately, I have a prior commitment, but I appreciate your consideration.\""

Keep in mind that if you use this option, the person might come back with a different time or ask when you're available.

They might be able to help you resolve your conflict if they really want you on board. Otherwise, you've bowed out quite professionally. Other similar options: \"That evening is tight for me so I don't think I can squeeze it in, but thanks anyway.\" \"I have back-to-back appointments that day, sorry.

[5] X Research source Maybe you have a scheduling conflict, but even if that conflict could be resolved, you still wouldn't want to do the thing. Saying \"I can't\" doesn't limit you to a single reason, so you have some wiggle room if the person starts clearing obstacles for you. You might also say: \"I'm sorry, I just have a lot on my plate right now. Thanks for thinking of me, though.\" \"I don't really have the bandwidth right now to give that the attention it deserves. But I do appreciate being considered.\""

If someone invites you to something they've organized themselves or are in charge of, it's great to acknowledge the work they've put into it. This response can also show that you're interested in similar opportunities in the future, even though you can't take advantage of this one. [6] X Research source Here are some other things you could say: \"That's such a wonderful opportunity. It's too bad I already have plans that day, but thanks for letting me know about it.\" \"I wish I could see your presentation, but unfortunately I've already made plans for that day.\""

If you feel like you simply can't add another commitment, this is one way to let the person know in a professional way.

In a work context, think about potential opportunities you might be giving up by saying this. The person might ask you to expand on your response if they want to better understand why you're not interested. \"That sounds like a great opportunity, but it's just not for me.\" \"I'm so sorry, but I don't think that's a good fit for me.\""
