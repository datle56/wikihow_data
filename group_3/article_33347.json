      "content": "Red Rover is played in 2 teams, so find at least 3 people to play on each team. Try to get a few extra people to join your game because having more players makes Red Rover more fun. Red Rover is the perfect game to play at recess when you know there are lots of players who will want to join. Just check with a teacher to make sure your school allows you to play. If you want to set up a game outside of school, plan it a day or two in advance so you have more time to get players to join."

      "content": "Play on a soft surface, such as a grassy field, so someone doesn’t get hurt if they fall down. Have the teams stand about 20 feet (6.1 m) apart from each other. Both teams face each other and line up side by side so they can hold hands. When you’re creating your line, have stronger players hold hands with weaker players for better chances at winning. If you’re playing with small or young children, have the teams stand closer together so they’re less likely to get hurt from running too fast."

Once the team has decided, they sing, \"Red Rover, Red Rover, we call (name) over!\" [1] X Research source When you’re choosing who to call over, pick a player who you think you’ll be able to stop without letting go of your team’s line. Try to pick smaller players before choosing the strongest ones."

[2] X Research source Variation: In games with fewer players, only the runner goes back to the original team without taking additional players. Variation: The runner may select anyone from the line to take back to their team instead of the players they tried to break through. If you’re playing this variation, run through the weakest spot in the line and take the strongest player back with you."
