As you ask them questions, the best way to have a meaningful conversation with them is to actively listen when they speak.

[14] X Research source Sometimes, checking your phone (even while talking to a significant other) is second nature. Make an effort to put down your phone when you start talking with them and don't check it until the conversation is over. As they talk, don't spend that time planning what you'll say next. Listen to them, and make little sounds like \"Mmhm\" or \"Go on\" to let them know you're listening. Listening to someone might not strike you as obviously affectionate, but it's actually one of the most caring things you can do for someone! Active listening tells the other person that you value their thoughts and feelings."
