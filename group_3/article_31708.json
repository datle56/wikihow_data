Sometimes, when you're in a hurry, you might end up passing the numbers by too quickly. Remember, you turn the dial to the right, the left, and the right again, stopping at each number in the combination. [1] X Trustworthy Source Understood Nonprofit organization dedicated to resources and support to people with thinking differences, such as ADHD or dyslexia Go to source Try the combination a few times. Sometimes you might put it in wrong without realizing it. Confirm that you have the right number before doing anything else. If you do it slowly, you can be sure that you put in the right combination."

      "content": "Grab and pull the latch on the handle if you can see it. Look closely at the bottom of the handle where you usually put your fingers to tug open the door. Most dial lockers have a small latch that you have to push up. Even if you can only see a little bit of the latch, try using it to open the door. Push it up as far as it will go, then yank the door back toward you. Sometimes this is enough for the door to come unstuck, but not always. If your locker is pretty full, for instance, you probably need to deal with something pushing against the lock."

      "title": "Shake the locker while pulling the handle.",
      "content": "Shake the locker while pulling the handle. Use all of your muscles to give the locker a good tug. Rattle it around as much as you can without attempting to rip the door off its hinges. Shaking the door could knock over whatever is leaning on the lock. [2] X Research source The locker door may still not open. If it doesn't come open after you shake it, stop trying to force it open. You don't need to end up with a doorless locker."

      "title": "Slap the locker a few times around the lock.",
      "content": "Slap the locker a few times around the lock. Jams usually happen when something falls onto the locking mechanism. Bop the locker to try and dislodge whatever is blocking it. Be gentle, though! Start with light hits and increase the amount of force you use, but don't put a dent in the door. [3] X Research source If the locker still won't budge, try pounding on it like you're knocking on a friend's door. You could also give it a swift kick if no one's looking, but be gentle. The locker isn't a punching bag and hitting it as hard as you can won't help. The last thing you need when dealing with a stuck locker is having someone jump out into the hallway and tell you you're responsible for the damage. Lockers are frustrating sometimes, but resist the temptation to haul back and kick yours!"

      "title": "Put pressure on the locker with your knee while opening it.",
      "content": "Put pressure on the locker with your knee while opening it. Prop your knee on the locker about Â¾ of the way up to the lock. Doing this is a little awkward, but the pressure often gets the locking mechanism working again. While you have your knee planted on the door, put in your combination and lift the latch on the locker's handle to open it. [4] X Research source Keep your knee on the locker the entire time until you're ready to open it. Once you lift the latch, you can put your foot back on the ground."

Have your friend push the door or keep their knee on it while you work the lock. If it still doesn't open, try having everyone pull the locker forward at the same time. Everything you ever learned about teamwork might finally pay off when that stubborn door flies open. [5] X Research source You could ask one of your friends to knock on the locker as you attempt to pull it. With your combined force, you could break through almost any jam!"

School janitors deal with plenty of locker problems and have special tools for opening them. The janitor can also repair the locker if you happen to have one that gets jams often. Before looking for the janitor, go to your classroom and tell your teacher. Let them take care of it so you don't get in trouble for being late. Who knows, you might get to share a book with that friend you wanted to talk to in class!"

Cleaning isn't the most fun thing when you're ready to race home after school, but at least stack your books straight so nothing falls on you when you open the locker door. [6] X Research source A lot of school lockers are old, so they don't work as well as you want them to. Any weight that presses against the lock could cause it to jam, so don't let anything tumble onto it. Locker organizers are a great way to keep your locker neat. Office supply stores often sell shelves that slide into your locker. Also, try hanging shelves and baskets."

      "content": "Remove broken keys or anything else you see stuck in the lock. That horrible snap doesn't have to mean you're locked out forever. Inspect the key slot to see what is in there, and then spray plenty of penetrating oil into the lock opening. Reach in with a pair of needle-nose pliers to pull out the blockage. If you can't grab it with pliers, try catching it with a jagged tool like a scroll or jigsaw blade. [7] X Research source Check your broken key before working on the lock. If you only have the head of the key left, you probably managed to turn the lock a little bit. Use a screwdriver to turn the lock back to its starting position so it releases the key. Try using a penetrating oil like WD-40. Keep the keyhole greased so the thing blocking it slides out as easily as possible."

      "content": "Spray a lubricant on the key if it doesn't turn in the lock. Most people never think of a lock is something that needs to be cleaned, but dirt can stop your locker from opening. The best lubricant to use is powdered graphite. Put some graphite in the lock's opening, then put your key in. Turn the key a few times to work in the lubricant and see if it allows you to open the door. [8] X Research source Powdered graphite is available at most hardware stores. It comes in a tube so you can easily squeeze it or spray it onto the lock. If you're in a pinch, try a silicone-based lubricant like WD-40. It isn't the worst thing to try, but it can gum up the lock if you use it often."

      "content": "Heat the lock-up to melt ice if you're in a cold area. Like how you feel frozen in the winter, your lock might freeze too. One of the easiest ways to fix a frozen lock is by spreading a little hand sanitizer on your key. Put the key in and turn it a few times to spread the hand sanitizer through the lock. If that doesn't work, you could also try getting a deicer from a hardware store. [9] X Research source Heat sources are good for melting the ice and preventing it from reforming. Since you probably can't move the locker, your options are limited. If you can find a place to plug in something like a hairdryer, point it at the lock and heat it for 2 or 3 minutes. You could also try blowing on the lock. Your hot breath helps melt the ice, but this can take a while. Use a tube like a toilet paper roll to direct your breath onto the lock, then blow for 3 to 5 minutes."

      "content": "Push the locker door in if you're able to turn the key. If you're sure that the lock is ready for use and you're able to turn the key, put pressure on the door. As you turn the key, apply firm but gentle pressure to it. You could also push against the door with your free hand. If the door still won't budge, also lift the key as much as you can while turning it and pushing it toward the lock. Lockers often get stuck when something hits the locking mechanism, such as a big package stuffed into a tiny space. Sometimes this takes the pressure off of the lock so you can open the door."

      "title": "Call a service line if you're renting the locker.",
      "content": "Call a service line if you're renting the locker. Some universities, jobs, and delivery services maintain lockers, for instance. You can usually get a stuck locker open by calling the person who assigned the locker to you. It's the equivalent of calling a janitor to deal with a bad school locker. Tell them that the locker is stuck and you need it opened. For example, if you're trying to open a package delivery locker, go to the front office or contact whoever gave you the locker key. Look for a sticker with a customer service number or go onto the post office's website to find it."

      "content": "Have the locker fixed by a repair technician. Once you get the locker open, see if it looks rusty or damaged. Close the locker and try to open it again. If it gives you more trouble, tell the locker manufacturer. Ask them to fix the locker or even replace it with a better one so you're not stuck fighting with it every time you want to get your stuff. [10] X Research source Call the business responsible for maintaining the locker if you don't own it. Don't attempt to take it apart on your own. Many jams are from items inside overstuffed lockers bumping up against the locking mechanism. All you have to do in this case is clean out the locker to prevent it from jamming again. If it jams repeatedly even after you try everything, you might need to get a new one."
