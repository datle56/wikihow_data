      "title": "Blot or scrape off excess makeup.",
      "content": "Blot or scrape off excess makeup. Use a dull knife or spoon to scrape off as much makeup as you can without pushing it deeper into the fabric. [1] X Research source If none can be removed this way, gently blot—don’t rub—the area with a clean cloth or paper towel. To flush the stain further, rinse it from the back with cold water. Always avoid using hot water to remove stains from clothes. Hot water tends to set stains deeper, while cold water lifts them. While you can blot the stain, don’t rub it with anything dry. Doing this can spread the makeup around and rub it deeper into the clothing. If the makeup is powder-based, try shaking or brushing the excess off. This method should work for most, if not all, makeup stains, including lipstick, foundation, and mascara."

      "title": "Pretreat the stain with dish soap or detergent.",
      "content": "Pretreat the stain with dish soap or detergent. Dab a bit of dish soap or gentle detergent directly onto the stain and work it into the fabric; use your fingers or a soft-bristle toothbrush to really saturate the fibers and pull out the stain. Let the treatment sit on the fabric for 5-10 minutes. [2] X Research source Another way to saturate the fabric is to rub it against itself until the stain starts to come up. Don’t use too much soap—the amount should be no larger than a dime and just enough to cover the stain."

      "title": "Wash the garment in the washing machine.",
      "content": "Wash the garment in the washing machine. Without rinsing the pretreatment, toss the garment in the washing machine as you normally would. Run the warmest cycle recommended by the care label and use your regular detergent. If the fabric isn’t machine-washable, hand wash it as you normally would. [3] X Research source If you hand wash your clothes, Stocker says, “Be careful when washing that you do not over scrub—if you do, you can damage the fibers, rip the items, or make them look threadbare… Be sure to let the garments soak long enough in the sink to let the cleaning ingredient have time to work its magic.”"

      "title": "Let the garment air dry.",
      "content": "Let the garment air dry. Check that the stains are gone and hang the item up or lay it flat to air dry. Do not put the garment in the dryer unless you’re 100% sure all stains are gone—the heat will just set them further. If any stains remain, repeat the cleaning process until they’re gone.

      "title": "Apply oil-free makeup remover.",
      "content": "Apply oil-free makeup remover. Makeup remover isn’t just good at getting makeup off your face—it can also sometimes remove makeup from fabric. Make sure your makeup remover is non-flammable and oil-free, then use a clean makeup pad to dab it on the stain. This often works well if the makeup is still fresh and hasn’t set into the fabric yet. [5] X Research source Usually, makeup remover can remove stains from both regular and waterproof makeup. If you have makeup removing wipes instead of liquid makeup remover, simply blot the stain with the wipe until it comes off. If you’re trying this method on silk or other delicate fabric, test the makeup remover on a small hidden area like under a collar or on a spot that gets tucked in before applying it to the stain. This way, you can see if it damages the fabric. Note: in most cases, the removal methods in this section can eliminate makeup stains without needing to use a washing machine. However, if the stains are stubborn and don’t come out completely, try running them through the wash as soon as you get the chance to get rid of remaining residue."

      "title": "Use a spot remover on small stains.",
      "content": "Use a spot remover on small stains. If you’re on the go or there’s only a small amount of makeup on your clothes, a spot remover pen or wipe might do the trick. Brush or blow off any makeup sitting on the surface, then saturate the stain with the spot remover, following the manufacturer’s instructions. [6] X Research source The wipes or pen you use should get the area clean until you can wash it later. Most of these products are safe even for dry-clean only materials."

      "title": "Blow loose powder off with a hair dryer.",
      "content": "Blow loose powder off with a hair dryer. If the makeup is powder-based, wiping or rubbing it will often only make the stain worse. Instead, set your hair dryer to cool and use it to blow the makeup off the garment. Be sure to angle the fabric so the powder doesn’t just blow across the surface. [7] X Research source Don’t set the hair dryer to hot, as this could cause the makeup to set even more. For any remaining streaks, try dabbing the area with a cloth dampened with cold water."

      "content": "Remove lipstick stains with hairspray. Scrape off as much lipstick as you can. Then, choose an alcohol-based hairspray and spray it directly onto the lipstick stain until the fabric looks wet. Allow the hairspray to dry for about 15 minutes, then dab the spot with a soapy sponge, cloth, or a wet wipe. [9] X Research source Make sure the hairspray contains alcohol; if it doesn’t, it won’t work. If your lipstick-stained garment is dry-clean only, scrape off as much as possible and blot it with a dry paper towel before placing it in a garment bag. Take it to the dry cleaner as soon as possible."

      "content": "Blot rubbing alcohol on lipstick or eyeliner stains. Rubbing alcohol, a key ingredient in makeup wipes, also works well on its own. Scrape off any makeup you can, then wet a cotton ball with rubbing alcohol. Dab the eyeliner or lipstick stain and let the alcohol sit for 5 minutes, then blot it away with a clean, damp cloth.

Grab a non-flammable makeup wipe to blot and gently rub the stain and transfer the mascara to a paper towel. When no more makeup comes off, rinse the stain with hot water, treat it with a detergent or spot treatment, and let it sit for 20 minutes before rinsing again. [11] X Research source If the mascara stain is completely dry, another option is to wipe it away with a clean spoolie."

      "content": "Use a lint roller on blush, bronzer, and powder foundation. If your makeup is powder-based like many blushes and bronzers and some foundations, remove the excess powder by rolling over it with a lint roller. Pretreat the remaining stain by dabbing on some laundry detergent with a cotton ball, then rinse the garment in cold water. Proceed to wash the garment as you normally would on the hottest setting indicated on the care label. [12] X Research source This works for any other powder-based makeup, like eyeshadow, as well. If the blush or foundation is cream/liquid based, simply pre-treat the stain with detergent, then wash as usual."

      "content": "Apply shaving cream to foundation stains. Spray some white, foam shaving cream directly onto the foundation stain. Let the foam sit for 3-5 minutes, then rub the fabric against itself to rub the cream into the stain. Rinse the area with cold water to remove the makeup and shaving cream. [13] X Research source Be sure to use shaving cream and not gel for this technique. Gel doesn’t have the same effect on a clothing stain. Stocker warns, “Be careful not to do this with wool or other fabrics that are dry clean only; your dry cleaner can get these out. If the shaving cream doesn’t get it all out, do it again, but this time mix a bit of rubbing alcohol with the shaving cream.”"

      "title": "Pretreat and wash the garment, using bleach as necessary.",
      "content": "Pretreat and wash the garment, using bleach as necessary. In many cases, follow the same steps as you’d use to remove makeup from colored clothes. Pretreat the stain with dish soap or detergent, let it soak for 5-10 minutes, then wash it as you normally would. [14] X Research source If the stain remains or the fabric is yellowed, try another spot treatment or wash it with some bleach. If the fabric is silk or wool, do not add bleach and instead repeat the spot treatment until the makeup is removed. If that doesn’t work, take the garment to the dry cleaner. When washing white clothes, Stocker says, “The best tip is to only wash white with white. Don’t even risk washing beige with white—it will discolor your white fabrics. Make sure to always use hot water to keep white bright, and use a whitening agent.” For whitening clothes, she recommends non-chlorine bleach and “very hot water.”"

      "content": "How can I avoid getting makeup on my clothes? If possible, put your clothes on after you finish applying your makeup. If your garments are tight-fitting or need to be pulled over your head, put your clothes on first but consider wearing a robe over them while doing your makeup. Use a good setting spray to prevent your makeup from rubbing off as you put on or take off your clothes. [16] X Research source"

      "content": "How do I get makeup out of carpet and upholstery? Scrape off as much makeup as possible with a dull knife or the edge of a spoon, being careful not to wipe the stain deeper. Mix 1 tbsp (14.7 ml) of laundry detergent with 2 cups (473 ml) of hot water (or use a commercial dry cleaning solvent ). Dip a sponge or clean white cloth into the mixture and gently dab the stain, working from the outer edge toward the center. When no more makeup is transferred to the cloth or sponge, rinse the area with another clean cloth dipped in cold water. Blot the fabric dry with clean paper towels. [17] X Research source This process may need to be repeated a few times to fully remove the makeup stain. If the upholstery is vintage, call a professional cleaner rather than attempting to clean it yourself."

      "title": "How do I get makeup off dry clean only clothes?",
      "content": "How do I get makeup off dry clean only clothes? Baking soda is great for removing oily stains like makeup from dry clean only clothes . Sprinkle a generous amount onto the stain and work it into the fabric with a clean white cloth or a small brush like a toothbrush. Let the baking soda sit for a few minutes to absorb the oil, then flip the garment over and shake off the excess. Alternatively, make a paste by adding a bit of water to the baking soda and applying it the same way. [18] X Research source If this doesn’t work, take the garment to a professional dry cleaner."
