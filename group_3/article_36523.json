      "content": "Remove excess grease with dish detergent, a degreaser, or shampoo. When it comes to cleaning a shirt collar, laundry expert Sergey Paramonov says, “most stains would probably be oil-based, coming from skin oil. I would recommend using some special chemistry to pull the oil-based stains [out].” The first thing you want to do is remove the grease so you can reach the stain underneath. There are several ways to do this, including the following: Using dish detergent: Dampen the shirt and cover the collar stain in liquid dish soap, like Dawn. Let it soak for at least an hour, then rinse it out. Using a degreaser: Use Fast Orange or another degreaser, which are products designed to cut through kitchen grease. Spray your degreaser on, allow it to soak for 5 minutes, then rinse it away. Be careful of very harsh products, though, as these can irritate the skin. Using shampoo: Choose a shampoo that’s designed for greasy hair . Get the shirt wet, then scrub the shampoo into the stain. Let it soak for about an hour, then rinse it out. Adding to the grease: Some people swear by adding more grease to the shirt collar. In theory, the new fat molecules bond to the old ones and help draw them out. Apply a product like a lanolin hand cleaner , which can be found at drug stores and car shops."

The enzymes help break down the proteins and other molecules in stains, making them easier to remove. It may be a good idea to apply some of the stain remover to your shirt’s underarms, as well, as these areas are prone to staining.

      "content": "Wash the shirt inside out. After the stain remover has soaked for at least 15-20 minutes, turn the shirt inside out and wash it as you normally would. It’s generally best to wash stained garments in cold water, as hot water may cause the stain to set and make it more difficult to remove. [3] X Research source If your shirt is delicate, place it in a mesh bag before washing it. If the stain is old and tough, presoak your shirt before washing it. Fill a sink or basin with tepid water and allow it to soak for 30 minutes. Then, apply more of your stain remover and toss it in the wash."

      "content": "Make sure the stain is gone before drying. When you take your shirt out of the washer, carefully inspect it to make sure the stain is gone. If the stain remains, do not put it in the dryer, as doing so will set it in further. Repeat the stain removal process to try to remove the ring, and allow the shirt to air dry . [4] X Research source If the stain remains, another option is to soak the shirt in a bleach-water solution overnight before rinsing it out. Follow the instructions on the container of bleach to dilute it properly. Check your shirt’s care label first to make sure it is safe to use bleach."

They may have better ways of removing the stain, and a single shirt rarely costs very much money at all.

Mix a 1:4 ratio of white vinegar and water in a bowl, then apply it directly to the stain. If you’re dealing with a tough stain, consider soaking the whole garment in the mixture. Let it sit for an hour, then rinse and launder the garment as usual. [6] X Research source Vinegar can stain some clothes, so test it in an inconspicuous area first to make sure it’s safe to use."

Squeeze fresh lemon juice directly onto the collar ring, and rub the area gently to work it into the stain. Then, set the garment in the sun for a few hours and launder as usual.

The collar stain is the result of grease and sweat mixing together, so one way to prevent the stains from forming is to make some adjustments to your hygiene routine.

Sweat strips are stickers that go on your shirt collar to help prevent rings and stains. Purchase sweat strips online or in a big box store, or make your own using absorbent pads. Add a snap-in, button-in, or hook-and-loop fastener strip to the collars of the worst offenders. These can be removed and washed as needed."
