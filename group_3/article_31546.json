      "content": "Use rubbing alcohol to clean the connection points in your pen. Unscrew the cartridge or charger from the battery and click the button 5 times to turn it off. Dip a cotton swab in 91% isopropyl alcohol and gently scrub the connection point on the battery and the bottom of the cartridge. [1] X Research source Wait for the cartridge and the battery to dry completely before reassembling the pen and turning it on. Turn on your pen by pressing the button 5 times."

      "content": "Check the charging cable and your power source. It might seem obvious, but make sure you’re connecting the charger to a working power outlet. Use the charging cable that came with your Ooze device and look it over to make sure that it’s still in good condition. If the charger light stays green but the battery doesn’t charge, you may have to replace the charger. [2] X Research source You can also see if the charger is defective by using another Ooze-brand charger. Sometimes, dust or debris can disrupt charging. Use a cotton swab or a small, soft brush to clean the charging port on the vape pen and the connector on the charging cable."

      "title": "Check that your cartridge coil is making a connection with the pen.",
      "content": "Check that your cartridge coil is making a connection with the pen. Your pen’s battery has a round coil on the bottom that connects with the coil on the cartridge to make a connection. If the coil on the cartridge is crooked, carefully push it back in place with a toothpick, bobby pin, or paper clip. [3] X Research source Try not to push on the coil too hard—this can cause further damage to the cartridge. If the coil is in the right position, you might have received a defective cartridge from the dispensary that won’t connect with the heating element of the battery. Visit the dispensary, explain the situation, and ask if you could switch it out. Most dispensaries would be happy to do this for you, but some may have you buy a new one."

      "title": "Inspect the battery for damage or wear and tear.",
      "content": "Inspect the battery for damage or wear and tear. Inspect the pen for any visible damage or signs of short-circuiting. If you drop your pen on the ground or in water, your battery might be permanently damaged—if this is the case, it might be time to buy a new one. [4] X Research source Water damage is not covered by Ooze’s warranty program, so you may have to buy a new battery out-of-pocket. [5] X Research source Most battery-powered vape pens last 6 to 12 months—if your battery is old, it may need to be replaced. If your vape pen is damaged, it’s recommended to stop using it immediately to prevent injury."

If you’ve tried everything and your pen still doesn’t charge, you may have to reach out to Ooze’s customer support so they can help you troubleshoot. Send an email to support@oozelife.com﻿ with your order number, your name, the email address associated with the order, and your specific issue. [6] X Research source If your problem is covered by Ooze’s 5-year warranty, they may be able to send you a replacement item. If you haven’t already, activate your warranty before you contact customer service. Enter your name, address, and the pen’s authentication code into Ooze’s product registration form . [7] X Research source Find the authentication code etched into the outside of your pen, near the base. You can also check inside the package for a warranty card—scratch off the silver part to see the code."

      "title": "Your pen battery is dead and needs to be charged.",
      "content": "Your pen battery is dead and needs to be charged. One of the most common reasons your Ooze pen light blinks green is that the battery has died and needs to be charged. If the battery is dead, the light will flash 10 to 15 times. Plug it into the charger —if the pen lights up solid green and the charger lights up red, it needs to be charged. [8] X Research source Once your pen fully charges, the charger light will turn green and the pen light will shut off. If the pen light still blinks green when you plug it into the charger, it may have a connection issue."

      "title": "Your Ooze pen battery is having a connection issue.",
      "content": "Your Ooze pen battery is having a connection issue. When your pen has a connection issue, it will usually blink green 4 to 5 times. This means your cartridge might be leaking, you have an irregular-sized cartridge, or the coil on the cartridge is deformed. [9] X Research source Cartridge is leaking: Clean the bottom of the cartridge and the connection point on the battery with a cotton swab dipped in rubbing alcohol. Wait until everything is dry before reassembling. Cartridge is an irregular size: Tighten or loosen the cartridge until you find a sweet spot that makes a connection. If that doesn’t work, you may have to buy a new cartridge in the right size. Cartridge has a deformed coil: To see if this is the issue, try a different cart that you know has worked with your pen before. If the old cart works, the issue is with the new one. Many licensed dispensaries know that this can happen, and might be willing to swap it with a new one. If neither cartridge works, then the pen is probably the issue."

      "content": "Your battery has been permanently damaged in transit. If you’ve tried to charge your pen, ruled out any connection issues, and your pen is still blinking green, the battery might’ve been damaged on its way to you from the factory. In this case, you may have to order a new one. [10] X Research source If your battery is acting strange and you bought your pen from a place other than the Ooze website, fill out Ooze’s suspected counterfeit form so they can investigate the issue."

      "content": "Install the cartridge onto your battery so that it’s only finger-tight. Overtightening a cartridge on a battery can cause the metal rings used to conduct electricity to press in too deep. This can make them unable to connect. [14] X Research source If this does happen, gently pry the metal ring upwards with a paperclip. The ring is only connected with a thin wire, so be careful not to break it off."
