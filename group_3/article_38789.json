You can also get a certificate from a certificate authority (CA). Free S/MIME certificates are available from companies like Actalis and Comodo . When you sign up for a certificate, you’ll receive a password that you’ll need to install the certificate. Copy it or write it down and keep it in a safe place so you don’t lose it."
