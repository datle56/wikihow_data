      "content": "Measure the fridge if you’re moving it through doorways. If you’re moving the refrigerator to a new home or a different room, make sure it will fit through any doorways and hallways before attempting to move it. Measure the height, width, and depth of the fridge with a tape measure, then do the same with any doorways or hallways. [1] X Research source If the fridge is too big, consult your owner’s manual to see how to remove the doors. While you’re at it, plan out the route you want to take. Make note of any stairs, sidewalk cracks, or curbs you’ll have to move the fridge across. See if you’ll need to remove any exterior doors to get the unit out of the house, as well. If you’re only moving the unit away from the wall to clean behind it, this step is unnecessary."

      "content": "Empty and clean the refrigerator. Before you try to move a fridge, make sure that both your refrigerator and freezer are free of food, condiments, ice cube trays, and anything else that might rattle around and shift weight. Take out all shelves and removable components, as well, then give the fridge a quick wipe down with a food-safe disinfectant to clean it . [2] X Research source Transfer all non-perishable food items into a cooler or icebox. Finish or toss any perishable items if you’re in the middle of a big move. Even if you’re just moving the fridge to clean behind it, taking everything out will make it easier and safer to move. It’ll probably be okay to place most items on the counter, as cleaning behind the fridge won’t take long. If you’re moving the fridge to a new house, wrap the shelves and other removable components in towels for protection, then label and stack them carefully."

      "title": "Unplug and defrost the fridge.",
      "content": "Unplug and defrost the fridge. Unplug the fridge from the wall and disconnect any water lines. If you’re moving the fridge to a new house, you’ll need to defrost it before going forward with the move. This usually takes 6-8 hours, so it’s usually best to start defrosting the night before the move. This allows the freezer to defrost overnight, then you can wipe the inside of the refrigerator in the morning. [3] X Research source Remember to leave the fridge and freezer doors open while the fridge defrosts. If you’re just moving the fridge to clean it or if you’re moving it to another spot in the kitchen, it isn’t necessary to defrost it. Coil the power cord securely and tape it in a tight bundle to make sure that it stays in place while moving."

      "content": "Slide the fridge out, tape the doors shut, and cover it. With the help of another person, gently rock the fridge side-to-side to walk it forward. If you’re worried about damaging your floors, use furniture slider pads or a floor protector . Then, use stretch tape to keep the doors shut and cover the unit with a moving blanket . Secure it with tape or rope to protect both the fridge and the walls as you move it. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Use a dolly to transport the fridge.",
      "content": "Use a dolly to transport the fridge. Place an appliance dolly at the center of one side of the unit and have your helper tilt it slightly so you can slip the dolly base underneath it. Tighten the dolly straps to secure the fridge. Then, slowly tilt the refrigerator back and ensure it is evenly balanced on the dolly. With your helper guiding you, carefully push the dolly toward your destination, keeping the dolly at no more than a 45 degree angle. [5] X Research source If possible, use a refrigerator dolly , but any dolly with straps will do. Just make sure the base is big enough to seat the fridge securely. Consider placing a towel or blanket between the dolly upright rails and the side of the refrigerator to help reduce the risk of scratching finished surfaces. Minimize any tilting when lifting and positioning the refrigerator on the dolly. Maintain its upright position to ensure that refrigerant oil doesn’t seep into the heat exchanger tubes. Appliance repair specialist Homer Flores says, “Most refrigerators have wheels. If a unit does not have wheels then a platform dolly will likely be required.” [6] X Expert Source Homer Flores Appliance Repair Specialist Expert Interview. 14 April 2021."

      "content": "Transport your fridge upright if possible and secure it with moving straps. To avoid damaging your fridge, transport it in an upright position if you have room. Laying a fridge down could potentially damage its ability to cool, as oil may move into the compressor or pipes and cause them to break. [7] X Research source If you must lay the fridge down, try to keep it at an angle or on its side rather than laying it completely flat on its back. Be sure to read your owner’s manual, however, as some manufacturers warn against transporting a fridge on its side. If you’re loading the fridge onto a truck, use a moving ramp to make the process easier. Walk backward and pull the unit up the ramp, with your helper pushing from the opposite side. If possible, leave the fridge attached to the dolly, then strap it down with moving straps to secure it to the truck. If you don’t have a moving ramp, get into the truck bed and have at least two people on the ground. Coordinate and lift simultaneously, pulling straight up with the handles of the dolly, while your helpers lift from the base and push it back into the bed."

      "content": "It is unsafe to attempt to move a fridge alone. Refrigerators are very heavy and should never be moved alone. Even if you’re just moving it away from the wall to clean it, have another person to help you. If you’re moving it a long distance, have someone to help you and use a dolly and moving straps to transport it safely. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "How do you move a fridge without a dolly? The only time you should move a fridge without a dolly is if you’re just shifting it away from the wall to clean behind it. Otherwise, a dolly or hand truck is needed to give you proper control and leverage over the heavy appliance. Make sure you have a couple other people to help you move it, as well.

      "content": "Can you transport a fridge in a pickup truck? It’s technically possible to transport a refrigerator in a pickup truck, but it isn’t the ideal option. A taller truck that allows you to strap the fridge upright is a better choice to keep the fridge intact throughout the move. If you don’t have a good way to transport the fridge yourself, consider hiring professional movers."

      "title": "When should you turn off the fridge before moving houses?",
      "content": "When should you turn off the fridge before moving houses? It depends on how long the fridge will be unplugged. If you’re only moving a short distance and the fridge will be unplugged for less than an hour, there’s usually no need to turn it off. If it will be unplugged for several hours, turn it off at least 24 hours before the move so it has time to defrost and for the fluids to settle. [10] X Research source Remember, turning off your fridge for an extended period of time can cause food to spoil, so store any food in a cooler or icebox beforehand."

      "title": "How long does a fridge need to be off after the move?",
      "content": "How long does a fridge need to be off after the move? In general, it’s recommended to leave your refrigerator off for 2-4 hours after moving it, and 24 hours if it was transported on its side. This allows the refrigerant in the compressor to settle and prevent potential damage. Coolant can flow into the compressor when the fridge is moved and turning it back on immediately can lead to cooling issues or compressor failure. [11] X Research source"

      "content": "How do you move a fridge down a flight of stairs? To move a refrigerator down a flight of stairs, move it down one step at a time, with your helper easing it down onto each successive step. It would be ideal to have two people in front of the dolly and another at the back, holding the handles and letting it down slowly. Communicate loudly and don't go too fast. [12] X Research source"
