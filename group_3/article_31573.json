Look at the line that says Chip . If you see Apple M1 , M2 , or M3 , you’ll need to use Parallels or another virtual machine. These apps work like a virtual Windows desktop on your Mac. If your Mac has an Intel chip, you’ll need to use the Boot Camp method to install Windows instead. Virtual machines like Parallels can run many EXE files, but there may be some they can’t open. VMs use a streamlined version of Windows called Windows on Arm , which is designed for efficiency and can only run a limited number of apps. You can also try the Wine method if you have a newer computer and would rather not use a virtual machine."

Parallels is the only Microsoft-authorized virtual machine that can run Windows on a Mac, which means it may be more secure and reliable than the alternative options on the market. However, if you’re looking for a virtual machine that doesn’t cost a hefty fee, VMware recently made its Fusion 13 Pro software free for personal use. [2] X Research source To get VMware Fusion Pro, you’ll need to register for an account on the Broadcom Support Portal . Once you’re registered and logged in, head over to this download page . Make sure you select the “for personal use” version of the software. Check out this detailed walkthrough of how to install and run Windows 11 using the VMware Player. If you go for this option, be aware that it’s a bit more limited than Parallels. VMware Fusion doesn’t include DirectX 11 support, so it’s not a great option for playing Windows games on your Mac.

To find out if your Mac has an Intel processor: Open the Apple menu and click About This Mac .

While you can install Wine directly using Terminal or the free Wine app, it’s a tricky and complicated process getting it to work—especially if you’re running macOS Catalina or later, which requires some additional modifications. Instead, you might want to try one of these third-party apps that are built on Wine but offer a more user-friendly and up-to-date interface: PlayOnMac : This option is free and works with a wide variety of Windows apps. Apple’s Game Porting Toolkit (macOS Sonoma and later) is another option for advanced users. You may be prompted to enroll in the Apple Developer program before you can use it. CrossOver is one of the most popular and user-friendly options, but it’s fairly expensive. However, you can try it free for 14 days before you commit to buying it. As of December 2024, version 24 is compatible with all versions of macOS from Catalina (10.15) to Sequoia (15.0)."

For example, here’s how you do it in CrossOver: In the CrossOver menu at the top of the screen, select Bottle > New Bottle . Enter a name for the Bottle (typically the name of the app or EXE file you’re trying to open), then click Create . Select your new Bottle from the left sidebar menu, then click Run Command . Click Browse and locate the EXE file on your Mac, then select it and click Open . Click Run to open your file. Click Save Command as a Launcher to make a shortcut icon for the EXE file. That way, you won’t have to go through this process again every time you run the file."
