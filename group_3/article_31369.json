From the proportionality of similar triangles , you know that any vector that has the same direction as vector A will have a terminal point (x/c, y/c) for some c. Furthermore, you know the length of the unit vector is 1. [6] X Research source Therefore, by the Pythagorean Theorem, [x^2/c^2 + y^2/c^2]^(1/2) = 1 -> [(x^2 + y^2)/c^2]^(1/2) -> (x^2 + y^2)^(1/2)/c = 1 -> c = (x^2 + y^2)^(1/2). Therefore, the unit vector u for the vector A = (x, y) is given as u = (x/(x^2 + y^2)^(1/2), y/(x^2 + y^2)^(1/2))"

Therefore, A = (2,3) normalizes to u = (2/(13^(1/2)), 3/(13^(1/2)))."
