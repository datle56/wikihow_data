      "content": "Determine if your small bed is a twin. Most twin beds are 39 inches (99 cm) wide, while a “narrow” twin is 36 inches (91 cm) wide. Standard length will be 75 inches (191 cm) long. In the UK, a single bed is 36 inches (91 cm) wide. An extra-long twin, like the beds in most dorm rooms, is 80 inches (203 cm) long. Look for sheet sets that say “x-long twin.” This bed size is used for most standard bunk beds."

      "content": "Move on to a full size bed if the bed is 54 inches (137 cm) wide. It should also be 75 inches (191 cm) long. In England and occasionally in the US, this is referred to as a “double” bed. While a twin bed fits one person, a full bed is best for one large person or two small children or adults."

      "content": "Increase your size to a queen bed if the width is 60 inches (152 cm). The length should be 80 inches (203 cm). If the length is 84 inches (213 cm), it is a California queen sized bed. There is no equivalent to a queen sized bed in the UK. The next largest size is a king. Another type of queen, called the “super,” or “expanded” queen is 66 inches (168 cm) wide and 80 inches (203 cm) long. The expanded is also thicker than the super or the standard queen. Queen sized beds and larger are designed with enough room for two adults."
