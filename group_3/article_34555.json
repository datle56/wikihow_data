Prune winter jasmine (including star jasmine) in late spring, immediately after it has finished blooming. [1] X Trustworthy Source Royal Horticultural Society Leading gardening charity in the U.K. providing resources for identifying, growing and caring for flowers and other plants Go to source Winter jasmine blooms from June to October in the Southern Hemisphere, and from March to April in the Northern Hemisphere. Summer jasmine blooms from April through June in the Northern Hemisphere, and from November through January in the Southern Hemisphere. Flowers form on the previous year's growth. Pruning immediately after flowering gives that growth time to mature so your plant can flower fully the next season."

      "content": "Focus on one stem section at a time. Pruning an older, well-established jasmine vine can be challenging. You may be tempted to yank at vines to pull them apart. If your jasmine is thick, start at the bottom and work up a single stem, clearing excessive growth as you go. Then move to the next stem. [3] X Research source If the vines are tangled, cut away the smaller branches to reveal the main vine. Then you can separate it from others and retrain it."

Remove weaker stems from the new growth to allow air and light to reach the vine. This also ensures your vines don't get so heavy that they damage their supports or cause them to collapse.

Cutting back some of the vines to about 3 feet (0.91 m) will keep your plant from growing off-balanced or damaging your fence or other supports. Shortened vines will grow back within 1 or 2 seasons. Jasmine can handle heavy pruning, so cutting back to this height shouldn't impact the plant's flowering next season."

If you don't want to cut these vines away, twist them gently in the right direction and tie them with gardening twine . Tie tight enough that the vine will stay in place, but not so tight that you damage the vine. Check your twine once a week or so to make sure it's not digging into the vine. If it is, loosen it a bit."
