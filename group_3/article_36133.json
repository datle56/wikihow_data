      "content": "Sort clothes normally. Remember to separate lights and darks and to keep delicate fabrics separate from tougher fabrics. This method will require you to use warm water, so if some of your clothes can only be washed in cold, you may want to use a different method to eliminate the smell of body odor from your clothes."

      "content": "Soak clothes in warm water and baking soda. Put clothes in a laundry basin, bucket, sink, or tub. Add enough warm water to that they are all completely submerged. Add two cups of baking soda to the basin. Stir it around a bit so that the baking soda is dispersed into the water. Let sit for at least several hours, if not overnight. You can also soak your clothes in a washing machine. Add your clothes to the machine and turn it on, so the basin of the machine begins to fill with water. Once the basin is filled, add two cups of baking soda to the basin and stop the machine. You should then let your clothes sit in the water and baking soda for a couple hours."

      "content": "Wash clothes by hand, or restart your washing machine. It's necessary to wash the baking soda out of your clothes after they have soaked. If washing by hand, use a normal amount of laundry detergent. You may need to change the water several times to get all of the soap and baking soda out. If using your washing machine, just turn it back on and add laundry soap, as usual. You can also try this method with vinegar. Add one cup of vinegar to your laundry and allow it to soak for several hours, however, after soaking your clothes in vinegar water, you will need to wash them with bleach-free detergent. Combining bleach and vinegar will create toxic fumes that are hazardous to your health. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Hang outside to dry, if possible. If that is not possible, you might consider laying your clothes out on a towel to dry. Wring the clothing out so that it is not dripping wet and lay it flat on a towel. Leave the clothing to dry for 24 - 48 hours. Hanging or laying your clothes out to dry will help your energy bill as well as your laundry. If you have not gotten all of the body odor out of your clothes during washing, dryers tend to lock the odors in place."

There are many commercial products that you can buy at the store but using a bit of your own laundry detergent may very well do the trick. [2] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source You can also try mixing a paste of baking soda and water. Make it thick, but not so thick you can't spread it. Apply the paste onto the area where the odor is most pungent. Some suggest crushing up uncoated aspirin and rubbing it onto the odorous areas of clothes. [3] X Research source The salicylic acid in the aspirin should help eliminate body odor smells."

      "content": "Spray treatment of vodka on the smelly spots. Simply put undiluted vodka into a spray bottle and spray the affected area directly. You will need to saturate the area completely, as a light misting will not do the trick. [4] X Research source This is an especially good method for getting rid of odors in dry-clean-only clothing. You don't always have time to take your clothes to the cleaners and that can get really expensive. Spraying spots may allow you to launder your nice clothes less often. You can also use isopropyl alcohol, vinegar, or hydrogen peroxide, but vodka has been used for removing a variety of smells from fabrics. It is odorless and evaporates quickly from your clothing, so you will not necessarily need to launder your clothes after using it, as you probably would with vinegar."
