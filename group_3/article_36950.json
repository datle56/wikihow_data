      "title": "Wait for the nail polish to dry.",
      "content": "Wait for the nail polish to dry. Your polish may look dry after several minutes, but it can take up to a day to dry completely. If you don't have time to let the polish dry for multiple hours, use a hair dryer on the cool setting to quicken the process. Place the blow dryer about 6 inches (15 cm) away from the screen and blast it for about one minute. [4] X Research source Clean your window screen with cold water to quicken the drying process. Do not clean your repaired window with hot water, as it can loosen nail polish."

      "content": "Unravel a few strands from the window screen. Sewing the screen shut is an option if the hole is too large to use adhesive. In some cases, you will not be able to sew the screen together without stitching a piece of scrap screening over the damaged area. To prep the screen for darning, unravel a few strands from the perimeter of the screen to use as your thread. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Line up the window screen seams as neatly as possible. Match the two ends of the screen as evenly as you can. If you cannot line up the two ends without leaving a noticeable hole in the middle, you may need to sew a piece of scrap screening over the hole. If you have any old or broken window screens, cut out a rectangle that is approximately the size of the hole. Patch screen material can work if no scrap screening is available. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Weave",
      "content": "Weave the strands through the screen with a needle. Once the torn edges are lined up, use a needle to weave the thread through the screen strands. If you don't have strands of screen material available, use a strong, long lasting thread (like heavy-duty or polyester thread). Make the stitches as small and identical as possible, and continue sewing until the hole is closed. Sew the torn edges together first and then, if the hole is still noticeable, place the patch over top and sew around its perimeter."

Then, bend the wires of the patch flat on the other side of the screen to hold the patch in place. Finally, adhere the patch to the screen with clear, waterproof silicone glue. If you don't want to weave the tear together, just glue it onto the existing screen. [9] X Expert Source Michael Fox Window Repair Specialist Expert Interview. 1 December 2020.
