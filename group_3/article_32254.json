      "title": "Wash and dry the hoodie on the highest heat setting to pre-shrink it.",
      "content": "Wash and dry the hoodie on the highest heat setting to pre-shrink it. Put your hoodie in the washing machine and set it to the warmest cycle. Add detergent as you normally would, but don’t use fabric softener since it can affect how well the paint will adhere. When the washer finishes running, set your dryer to the hottest setting and run the hoodie through the full cycle until it’s dry. [1] X Research source Pre-shrinking your shirt prevents the paint from cracking or chipping after you add your design to the hoodie. You can paint on any kind of hoodie, but paint will work best on cotton."

      "title": "Slide a piece of cardboard inside the hoodie to keep it flat.",
      "content": "Slide a piece of cardboard inside the hoodie to keep it flat. Use a piece of cardboard that’s about 1 inch (2.5 cm) narrower than the bottom of the hoodie. Push the cardboard into the bottom hole of the hoodie so the fabric lies flat on the surface. Smooth out any wrinkles on the surface that you want to paint so your design doesn’t get distorted while you’re working on it. The cardboard will also prevent the paint from bleeding through to the other side of the hoodie."

    {
      "title": "Cover a flat work surface with a drop cloth and lay the hoodie on top.",
      "content": "Cover a flat work surface with a drop cloth and lay the hoodie on top. Look for a flat work surface that’s large enough to spread out the hoodie. Fold a drop cloth in half before setting it on top of the work surface to protect it from any spills or spatters. Set the hoodie down so there’s at least 3 inches (7.6 cm) of drop cloth extending out from each side. [2] X Research source If you don’t have a drop cloth, cut a garbage bag in half and spread it out on your work surface instead. Avoid using bed sheets or newspapers to protect your surface since paint can easily bleed through them and leave stains."

      "title": "Put coin-sized amounts of fabric paint on an artist’s palette.",
      "content": "Put coin-sized amounts of fabric paint on an artist’s palette. Fabric paint doesn’t stiffen when it dries, so your hoodie will still be comfortable to wear after you paint it. Choose the colors that you want to paint on your hoodie and squeeze them onto your artist’s palette. Leave about 2 inches (5.1 cm) between your colors so you have room to mix them. [3] X Research source You can buy fabric paint from your local arts and crafts store or online. Mix black paint with a color if you want to make it a darker shade. If you want a lighter tint, combine the color with white paint."

    {
      "title": "Draw your design on the hoodie with chalk to use as a guide.",
      "content": "Draw your design on the hoodie with chalk to use as a guide. Fabric paint is permanent once it touches fabric, so plan out your design beforehand so you don’t add paint where you don’t want it. Lightly sketch the outline of your design with a piece of chalk to see how it fits on your hoodie. Take a few steps back from the hoodie to look at the design to see if you’re happy with how it looks from a distance. You don’t have to draw the design on your hoodie if you don’t want to, but it will make it easier to plan the whole design. If you want to change your design, wipe the chalk off with your hand before drawing the new outline."

    {
      "title": "Use short strokes to apply the paint directly on your hoodie.",
      "content": "Use short strokes to apply the paint directly on your hoodie. Work from the lightest colors to the darkest so the shades are easier to blend. Dip the bristles of a paintbrush into the color you want to apply so you have a thin layer of paint on them. Hold the brush in your hand like a pencil and drag the bristles over the fabric to apply the paint. Start at the top of your design and work toward the bottom so you’re less likely to smudge the colors. [4] X Research source Get a brush set that has multiple styles of brushes so you can experiment with how they apply paint. You can buy brush sets online or from your local craft store. Try flat-tipped brushes if you want to make broad lines or cover large areas with paint. Use brushes with pointed tips if you want to make thin lines or add small details to your piece."

      "title": "Dab round brushes straight down if you want to freehand polka dots.",
      "content": "Dab round brushes straight down if you want to freehand polka dots. Choose a rounded brush that roughly has the same diameter as the dots you want to add to your hoodie. Dip the end of the brush in the color you want to use so there’s a thin layer of paint on the bristles. Hold the brush vertically and dab it straight down onto the hoodie. Spin the brush to pick up excess paint before pulling it straight up. Continue putting polka dots on the rest of your hoodie the same way. [5] X Research source If you want to make polka dots that are larger than your brush, trace around a lid or bowl with chalk to add the dots to the hoodie. Paint within the outlines with your brushes. Don’t push down too hard on the brush, or else the bristles will fan out and make your polka dots look messy."

      "title": "Draw with fabric paint markers if you want to add detailed lines.",
      "content": "Draw with fabric paint markers if you want to add detailed lines. Shake the fabric paint marker with the cap on to help work the paint into the drawing tip. Take the cap off and press the tip onto a scrap piece of fabric to remove any of the excess paint. Draw your lines directly on the hoodie in long, slow strokes so it doesn’t slip. If the marker starts to dry out, put the cap back on and shake it again. [6] X Research source You can buy fabric paint markers from your local crafts store or online. Use fabric paint markers if you want to do hand-lettering or add outlines to your drawings."

      "title": "Flick diluted paint on your hoodie if you want to make a splatter pattern.",
      "content": "Flick diluted paint on your hoodie if you want to make a splatter pattern. Put 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of paint in a glass with 1 teaspoon (4.9 ml) of clean water and stir it together. Dip a paintbrush into the glass to coat the bristles in a thin layer of paint. Hold the brush 6 inches (15 cm) away from your hoodie and flick the brush forward to apply drops to the sweatshirt. [7] X Research source This works great if you want to add a random, colorful pattern to your hoody. Try misting the hoodie with water and a spray bottle before flicking paint onto it. That way, the paint will spread more and create a watercolor effect. Cover any areas that you don’t want to get paint on, such as the inside of the neck hole, with painter’s tape."

      "title": "Rinse your brushes in clean water when you change colors or finish painting.",
      "content": "Rinse your brushes in clean water when you change colors or finish painting. Fill a small cup with water and keep it near your work station. Dip the dirty brush in the cup of water and swish it around to clean the paint off of the bristles. Wipe the brush on a piece of paper towel to remove any paint that’s still stuck in the bristles.

      "title": "Print a stencil",
      "content": "Print a stencil on freezer paper if you want to make repeated patterns or lettering. Go into a text or photo editing program on your computer and put the image or text you want to paint in a document. Load freezer paper into your printer so the design prints on the matte surface of the paper. Print the design so it’s the same size as what you want on your hoodie. [9] X Research source Depending on the size of the stencil, you may need to use multiple sheets of freezer paper. Make sure you don’t print on the shiny coated side of the freezer paper, or else the ink won’t adhere properly. You can also use stencils that you bought from a craft store if you don’t want to make your own."

      "content": "Cut along the outline of the stencil with a craft knife. Tape the edges of the freezer paper down on a cutting board so it doesn’t move around. Poke your knife through the freezer paper along the outline of your design and carefully pull the blade along the line. Cut out any sections of the stencil that you want to show up on your hoodie. Dispose of any scraps of paper that you cut out to keep your work space clean. [10] X Research source Work slowly so you don’t accidentally rip through the paper, or else you’ll need to start over."

      "title": "Tape the stencil to the hoodie with masking tape.",
      "content": "Tape the stencil to the hoodie with masking tape. Lay the stencil flat on your hoodie and smooth it out so it doesn’t have any wrinkles. Rip strips of masking tape that are the same lengths as the sides of the stencil. Press the tape along the edges of the stencil so it’s flat against the fabric of the hoodie. [11] X Research source Make sure you don’t cover any of your design with tape, or else it won’t show up on the hoodie when you paint."

      "content": "Put fabric paint on your palette. Choose the colors of fabric paint you want to use for your design and get them from a craft store. Add a coin-sized amount of the paint onto your palette before putting the cap back on so it doesn’t dry out. Put the rest of your colors leaving at least 2 inches (5.1 cm) of space between them so you have room to mix different shades and tints. [12] X Research source Put black paint on your palette if you want to make the paint darker shades. Mix white paint with colors to make a light tint."

      "content": "Dab the sponge vertically to apply the paint. Dip the end of an art sponge into the paint you want to apply to your design first. Starting from the outer edge of the stencil, push the sponge down vertically to apply the paint. Lift the sponge straight up and work your way toward the center of the stencil so you have even paint coverage. If you want to add another color, rinse the sponge with clean water and wring it out before applying the next shade."

      "title": "Remove the stencil as soon as you’re done painting.",
      "content": "Remove the stencil as soon as you’re done painting. Leaving a stencil on while the paint dries can make the edges of the design bleed or make the stencil stick to the fabric. Carefully pull the tape off of the stencil so you don’t rip the freezer paper. Lift the stencil straight up to prevent smudges and set the stencil aside on your drop cloth. [13] X Research source If you plan on using the stencil again for a repeated design, wipe it off with a clean paper towel to remove the excess paint."

      "content": "Work in a well-ventilated area to prevent fume build-up. Although fabric spray paints have lower emissions than standard paints, they still can create harmful fumes. Choose a room that has an open window or work outside so you the fumes dissipate in the air. Lay your drop cloth on a flat surface and put your hoodie on top of it. [15] X Research source You do not need to wear a face mask when working with fabric spray paints."

Set the cardboard pieces flat on the hoodie to frame the spot you’re painting. Avoid taping the cardboard down, or else the shapes of the strips will show up in your design. [16] X Research source You can also apply long strips of masking or painters tape directly to the hoodie if you want to make a striped pattern."

Hold the nozzle so it’s 6 inches (15 cm) above the hoodie and press down on the button to spray it. Move the spray paint can horizontally back and forth across your design to apply an even coat of paint on your hoodie. [17] X Research source Test the spray paint on your drop cloth the first time you spray it to make sure the paint applies in an even spray. Otherwise, the paint may splatter on the hoodie and ruin the design."

      "content": "Make horizontal stripes with different colors if you want an ombre pattern. Choose 3–4 colors that range from a dark color to light one for the ombre pattern. Start with the darkest color and spray a stripe across the bottom of the hoodie. Switch to the next lightest shade and use it to apply another stripe of color. Make sure the 2 stripes overlap by about 1 inch (2.5 cm) so the edges blend together. Continue working up the hoodie so each stripe is a lighter color than the one below it. Leave the natural color of the hoodie visible on top if you want."

      "title": "Wait 24 hours for the paint to dry completely.",
      "content": "Wait 24 hours for the paint to dry completely. Leave the hoodie undisturbed on your work surface so it has time to dry. Usually, the paint will take about 1 day to completely dry, but it may depend on the thickness of the paint. Tap the paint with your finger to see if any of it lifts up. If it does, allow the paint to dry for another hour before checking it again. [18] X Research source Try setting up a fan on low speed near your hoodie to help speed up the drying process. Avoid hanging the hoodie to let the paint dry since the colors could run and drip."

      "content": "Wash your hoodie inside-out on the gentle cycle 5 days after painting it. Wait at least 5 days to ensure that the paint completely sets on the fabric. Turn the hoodie inside-out to reduce the chances of the design fading in the wash. Choose the cycle labeled “Gentle” or “Delicates” and use detergent and fabric softener as you normally would. You can also wash the hoodie by hand if you’re worried about damaging it in your washer."
