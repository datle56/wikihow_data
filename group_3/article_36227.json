      "content": "Place the wet clothes in the dryer and dry them on low heat. The lint collector will catch most, if not all, of the tissue pieces for you. After the dryer has finished its cycle, clean the lint from the lint catcher and throw it away. [1] X Research source Shake the clothes out on the floor or outside first to remove the largest pieces. Remember to pick up or sweep up the pieces that fall, so they don't leave a mess or become an environmental hazard. If your clothes aren't dryer-safe, let them air dry completely and then shake them out or use your fingers , tape , or a lint roller to remove the tissue pieces."

      "content": "Soak the tissue-covered clothing in cold water with 4 aspirin overnight. Fill a plastic bucket or tub with cold water. Submerge the clothes in the water and add in 4 aspirin tablets. Stir the aspirin into the water and let the clothes soak in the mixture overnight. [2] X Research source The next day, the aspirin should have completely dissolved the tissue in your clothes. Remove the clothes from the plastic bucket, squeeze out the excess water, and load them into the dryer on low heat. If the clothes aren't dryer-safe, lay or hang them out to air dry instead. If your clothes are supposed to be washed in warm or hot water, simply raise the temperature of the water before pouring it in the bucket or tub."

      "content": "Wash your wet clothes again with fabric softener only. Only add the amount of fabric softener the manufacturer recommends for your load size. After running your clothes through another full cycle, start an extra spin cycle to help remove any lingering tissues. The fabric softener works because it breaks the electrical bond holding the tissue to your clothes. Then the wash and spin cycles help rinse the tissue pieces away. [3] X Research source After your clothes are washed again, run a cleaning cycle on your washing machine to fully clear the tissue from the drum."

      "content": "Roll a lint roller across your dried clothes to take up tissue. A lint roller is inexpensive and can be purchased at almost any dollar or convenient store. Remove the outer packaging and then roll the sticky paper back and forth across a piece of your clothing, and the tissue and lint should stick to it. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Use the sticky side of tape to remove little pieces of tissue. Masking tape is best since it's a strong enough adhesive to take up the tissue without leaving a residue on your clothes (it's also a great lint roller substitute). Wrap the tape around your hand with the adhesive side facing outward and dab the clothing with it. The tissue should stick to the tape, easily removing it from your clothes. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Pick pieces of tissue off your dried clothes by hand. This is a great option if your clothes have already been through a dryer cycle and only the smallest pieces are left. It's also a useful alternative if your clothes aren't dryer-safe and you can't wait for them to soak in water and aspirin overnight. To make the job easier, use a clothes brush to push the tissue off your laundry or into one area so it's easy to pick off. Just remember to clean the fallen tissue off the floor or whatever surface you're cleaning the clothes over."
