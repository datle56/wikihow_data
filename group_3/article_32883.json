      "content": "Avoid getting in trouble. As you are preparing to plank, be sure you won’t get in trouble. Do it in a location where you won’t bother anyone or break anything, or do it in a less acceptable location when no one is watching. You don’t want to get in a fight with a cop over planking. That’s not going to sound very impressive later on when you have to tell the story every time you apply for a job."

      "title": "Get in position.",
      "content": "Get in position. Lay face-down in a rigid, straight position. Balance on whatever object or surface you wish to plank on. Hold your arms at your side, palm flat against your thigh. Keep your feet perpendicular with the line of your legs, if possible, so that your toes touch the planking surface."

      "title": "Take the picture.",
      "content": "Take the picture. Get whatever friend you brought with you to take the picture. Be sure that the camera is adjusted for lighting if taking the picture at night or in a dark location. Upload the picture for all the internet to marvel at."
