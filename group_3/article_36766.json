      "title": "Look on the underside of the faucet to locate the screw.",
      "content": "Look on the underside of the faucet to locate the screw. Slip-on spouts will have a set screw under the spout, near the tub wall. The set screw secures the spout onto the water supply pipe. Feel and look at the faucet for a screw hole on the underside of it. If there is no screw under your faucet, you probably have a screw-on faucet. [1] X Research source The screw is usually recessed. Use a flashlight to help you locate the screw. Close the drain so that small parts cannot fall into it. Spread a rag or towel across the bottom of the tub to protect its surface from falling tools or parts."

Carefully peel away at the edges of the caulk with a putty knife. Continue scraping the caulk away until your remove it all. [2] X Research source Use a razor blade as an alternative to a putty knife. If there is no caulk on your faucet, you can skip this step."
