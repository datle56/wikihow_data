Before you even start considering setting up, make sure it isn't against the rules in your area. To find out if you're allowed to set up a stand, see if you need to get a permit or comply with any laws. [1] X Research source Ask your parents to find out whether you can set up a stand. Let them know that you need a permit in many states. Or find out yourself by calling your local Better Business Bureau to get more information.

      "content": "Choose a popular spot. If you live on a dead-end street or a small road, you might want to try a place that gets more foot traffic. Intersections are also good spots, since you have people passing from more than one direction. Make sure the spot you choose is safe. Don't set up too close to streets or highways. Setting up in your front yard or home area is a great option. This works especially if you live on a busy street or in a big apartment complex. Plus, you would be able to get supplies easily rather than carrying them all the way to another location. Be careful about setting up in public parks or outside sporting events. Many states have passed laws against letting people sell lemonade in these areas without any sort of permission. [3] X Research source"

If you are planning a long day of selling, make sure you seriously trust the person taking shifts not to steal any money. An untrustworthy business-partner can ruin your stand!"

      "content": "Think of a fair price. You would want to make it not too expensive so no one would buy your products, and not too cheap so you would barely make any money. If you're using fresh lemons, fresh ice, and large glasses, you could probably charge $1.00 to $1.25 per cup. If you're using a powdered mix and serving up small glasses, people probably won't pay more than $0.25 to $0.50. Often, lemonade stands are either under- or overpriced, and the kids running them don't earn much money . Be sure to start out with some coins and bills for change."

The sign should say what you're selling and how much it costs. Use cheerful hand lettering that's neatly done. You might want to draw a picture of lemons or lemonade to make your sign more attractive. You can also make signs to post around the neighborhood. Tell people where to go to buy lemonade. If you do this, make sure you take down the signs when you take down your stand."

Get a chair for each person who will be running the stand with you. To attract more customers, use a pretty (but not distracting) tablecloth, and tape your sign to the front. Bright colors will get people to look at your table, and they'll think, \"Hey, it seems like they put in a lot of effort making that stand! I bet the drinks and snacks taste as good as this stand looks!\" ."

Be sure to sample each batch to make sure it has just the right amount of sweet and sour flavors before you try to sell it. Always serve your lemonade with ice to keep it cold. Here are three ways to make lemonade: [4] X Research source Make it from scratch with fresh-squeezed lemons. For one gallon of lemonade, you need 2 cups of fresh lemon juice and 2 cups of white sugar. Mix well so the sugar dissolves. Make it from concentrate. You can buy a can of frozen lemonade concentrate in the freezer aisle of your grocery store. Mix it with water according to the instructions on the package. Make it from powder. Get a can of powdered lemonade. Follow the instructions to dissolve the powder in cold water."

Ask your parents for old lemonade glasses, bring dishwasher fluid and a dishcloth and find a location near a public fountain where you can do your dishes when you run out of clean glasses. Don't give people napkins, but refer them to a public drinking fountain or toilet. Make sure to properly clean the glasses or customers won't come back!"

Cookies , brownies and other baked goods are fun to sell. You could also offer a bigger variety of drinks. Strawberry lemonade, iced tea or fruit punch are refreshing drinks customers might enjoy. Some websites let you sign up to start a lemonade stand or bake stand, and donate part of your profit to help end hunger."

Once they have the lemonade in their hands, take their money and place it in your cash register. Don't forget to thank them. After all, they just bought something from your lemonade stand. With luck, they'll tell their friends to visit your stand. Remember to always be nice to your customers, a common expression is \"the customer is always right.\" While they're good exceptions to this rule (like a customer asking you to fire a completely professional employee), it is a good guideline."
