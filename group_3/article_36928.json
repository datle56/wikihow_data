      "content": "Mix 2-part wood filler so it’s thoroughly combined. A 2-part wood filler comes separately as a resin base and a hardener. Use a putty knife to scoop a golf ball-sized amount of resin onto a paper plate. Add a 1 inch (2.5 cm) squirt of the hardener to the resin and stir it together into a thick paste. [1] X Research source A 2-part wood filler will have a greater resistance to future nicks and scratches than other types of wood filler or putty. You can also use wood filler to cover screw holes in your door frame."

      "content": "Use a putty knife to apply the filler into the gouges and dents. Apply the wood filler to the damaged area on your door frame to fill it entirely. Try to smooth out the filler so it’s flush with the rest of the door jamb, but it’s okay if you overfill the gouge and it looks a little messy right now. [2] X Research source After you mix the hardener with the resin, your wood filler will start to set and harden within a few minutes. Apply the wood filler quickly so it’s still easy to work with."

      "content": "Slice off the excess wood filler with a utility knife after 5 minutes. After a few minutes, the wood filler will have rubber-like consistency. Run the blade of the knife across the door jamb to slice off any filler that’s sticking above the surface. Keep cutting the filler down until it’s flush with the surface of the door frame. [3] X Research source It’s okay if the filler isn’t perfectly flush yet. Just try to remove as much as you can so you don’t have as much to sand later."

      "content": "Let the wood filler set for 30–60 minutes. Even though the wood filler will start setting within a few minutes, it won’t be completely dry or ready to finish that fast. Wait the recommended amount of time on the package instructions before continuing to work on your repairs. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Sand the wood filler smooth with fine-grit sandpaper . Use 120-grit sandpaper to lightly rub the wood’s surface and smooth it out. After a minute or so, run your hand over the door frame and wood filler to check if they feel flush. If the filler is still above the surface, keep sanding until it’s smooth. [5] X Research source Wrap the sandpaper around a scrap wood block to get a little more leverage while you’re sanding. [6] X Research source"

Lightly sand the primer down and then apply a coat of paint so your repair blends in. [7] X Research source You can try staining wood filler , but it may have a slightly different color than the rest of the frame."

      "content": "Scrape out the rotted wood with a chisel . Look for wood rot near the bottom of your door frame where water tends to pool during rain or floods. Remove all of the soft, rotted areas of wood by scraping it out with the tip of your chisel. Try to get every last bit of rotted wood you can see since even a small amount leftover could allow the rot to keep spreading. [8] X Research source To clean out the rot even faster, use a wood-grinding bit and a drill to remove it. If the rot covers a large area that’s larger than 6 inches (15 cm), then it’ll be more effective to cut out and replace a section of the door frame . When the frame becomes rotted, it can spread to the door as well. Inspect the door where it meets the frame for signs of rot, and replace the door if there’s damage."

Fill in as much space in the door jamb with scrap wood or wire mesh as you can. Then, secure the pieces in place with a few screws so they don’t fall out or move around. [9] X Research source"

Use a putty knife to fill the cavity with the wood filler so it’s flush with the sides of the door jamb. Scrape the filler so it’s smooth on top of the door frame’s surface and forms a flush edge. [10] X Research source Alternatively, you can use auto body filler instead. Just like epoxy wood filler, auto body filler comes with a resin and hardener and is suited for withstanding wear and tear. Once you mix it, the epoxy filler dries quickly, so apply it as soon as you can so it doesn’t become difficult to work with."

Rub the sandpaper block back and forth over the dried wood filler to sand it down. Keep smoothing down the surface until the filler is flush with the rest of the frame.

Keep moving the chisel around your entire door frame and removing pieces until the frame underneath is exposed. [14] X Research source The door stop is the wooden strip in the middle of the frame that prevents the door from swinging open. The molding is the decorative trim around the outside of the frame. Work slowly and carefully so you don’t damage the stop or molding as you remove them from the frame. When you’re pulling out the door stop, position the claw of your hammer directly over the nails to prevent the stop from breaking."

Secure nails every 1 foot (30 cm) to keep the trim pieces in place. [18] X Research source Test opening and closing the door, and loosen the shims if the door rubs against the frame again.

[22] X Research source Dry-fit the piece into your frame to make sure it’s snug. Trim the board if it still doesn’t fit in the opening. Avoid using pressure-treated wood since it will twist and warp once it dries out. If you believe your door frame is made from non-standard wood, take the damaged portion to your local hardware store.
