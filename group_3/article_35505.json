Explain why you suspect you have repressed memories, as well as what you think might have happened. What feelings or mental health conditions are you experiencing that might stem from these memories? What have you been treated for in the past? [4] X Research source Your therapist needs to know what you want to change in your life. As they treat you, they can help you work toward these goals, even if you don’t recover all of your memories. For example, you might have a lot of anxiety that you believe is tied to a negative experience you had when you were a small child. You could say, “My anxiety is making it impossible for me to relax. I always feel upset and nervous, and I think it’s because of something that happened to me while I spent the summer with my grandparents at age 7.”"

      "content": "Use sensory-triggers to help you remember. Repressed memories may be tied to a specific state of mind. Engaging your 5 senses can help you return to that moment, though it may be painful for you. The sights, smells, sounds, feel, and tastes associated with your memory might trigger it. However, it's best to not do this on your own, since the memories may bring back painful emotions or re-traumatize you. [7] X Research source For example, let's say you want to remember something that happened at a party you attended. You might put on the clothes you were wearing, listen to the music that was playing at the party, look at photos from that night, and eat the same foods that were served at the party. If you’re not sure where to get started, consider where you have memory gaps. For example, do you have lots of memories from when you were 6-years-old and 8-years-old, but none from when you were 7-years-old? This is a memory gap, so you might try to trigger memories from that age. [8] X Research source It's best to work with a therapist if you're going to try to trigger your repressed memories."

However, it might also be scary for you to go back to the place where it happened. Additionally, you may need other triggers that make you return to that time to recover your memories. [9] X Research source You may remember painful experiences, so don't go by yourself. Ask someone you trust or your therapist to help you through this process. Don’t put yourself in a dangerous situation, either physically or mentally. Avoid going back to a place where you may be hurt. For example, you might go back to your hometown to retrace your steps in the hopes of recovering lost childhood memories. You might use familiar smells, your favorite childhood toys, and old photos to help trigger your memories."

      "title": "Use hypnosis with caution.",
      "content": "Use hypnosis with caution. You might be drawn to hypnosis because it seems like an easy way to recover your memories. Since hypnosis alters your state of consciousness, you can access different parts of your mind and potentially recover your memories either in fragments or all at once. However, hypnosis also allows you to easily believe things that are told or suggested to you, even if they aren’t true. In some cases, this can create false memories, which are just as painful as real memories. [10] X Research source Some mental health professionals may suggest using hypnosis to recover your repressed memories. However, experts warn that it's hard to distinguish between a real and false memory uncovered during hypnosis. If you want to try hypnosis, look for a hypnotherapist who is experienced in working with people who’ve experienced a trauma. It's best to work with a therapist or counselor who is also trained in hypnotherapy. Go over the type of questions or suggestions the hypnotherapist will use to prompt you so you can make sure they aren’t leading you toward a particular type of memory. Make sure they record your session so you can listen to everything that it said."

      "content": "Focus on your feelings, instead. It's likely that you want to recover your repressed memories because you're dealing with painful emotions or want to improve your mental health. Fortunately, you don’t have to remember what happened to you in order to cope with those feelings. It’s enough to know that you’re dealing with emotions tied to past experiences. Trying to force a repressed memory to the surface can be more harmful than not remembering. Instead, learn new coping strategies to deal with your painful emotions moving forward. Additionally, work with a therapist to manage the thoughts and behaviors that you want to change. [11] X Research source For example, you might feel uncomfortable when people try to hug you. You don’t need to know the reason why you feel uncomfortable to work through that issue. It’s enough to know you feel this way and want to do something about it. It's best to work with a therapist if you believe your repressed memories are harming your mental health. They can help you work through trauma and use cognitive behavioral therapy to make positive changes in your life."

      "content": "Watch for common symptoms of dissociation. When something bad happens to you, your mind may try to block out what is happening, which is called dissociation. Repressed memories happen when you are trying to dissociate yourself from a traumatic event. People who use dissociation to deal with painful experiences may dissociate in other ways as well. Stopping dissociation may help you recover your memories.

      "content": "Ground yourself in the present by engaging your 5 senses. When you ground yourself, you can bring your mind into the present, which often brings a sense of calm. Focusing on all 5 of your senses will help root you in your current location. This helps you stop dissociating and keep your thoughts on the present. If you’re struggling to engage all 5 senses, using just 1 can help you break your dissociative cycle. Here’s how: [14] X Research source Sight: describe the location, list items around you that are blue, look for a specific item, describe an interesting thing that’s nearby. Sound: explain what’s happening in the moment aloud to yourself, listen to music, pick out the sounds you can hear. Touch: notice how your body feels, feel the sensation of your feet on the ground, touch a textured item in your environment. Smell: sniff the air and pick out the smells or take a whiff of an essential oil. Taste: eat a small snack or stick out your tongue to taste the air."

Put all of your focus on one activity, such as knitting, painting, wood carving, or building an arduino."
