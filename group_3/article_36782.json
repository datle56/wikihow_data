      "title": "Unscrew the bottlecap.",
      "content": "Unscrew the bottlecap. You won’t be able to take the stopper out with the cap on. Take it off and put it to the side. Make sure to work on a flat, solid surface. Otherwise you could spill the liquor while you work. On some bottles, the cap screws onto the stopper part. This means that you won’t be able to reattach the cap if you remove the stopper."

      "title": "Insert a knife underneath the metal wrapping around the bottleneck.",
      "content": "Insert a knife underneath the metal wrapping around the bottleneck. Use something with a thin blade, like a utility or razorblade knife. Tuck it between the metal wrapping around the bottleneck. [1] X Research source It doesn’t matter if you insert the knife on the top or bottom of the wrapper. Be very careful when using a knife. Cut away from yourself and wear gloves to avoid cuts."
    },
    {
      "title": "Slice through the wrapping from top to bottom.",
      "content": "Slice through the wrapping from top to bottom. Slice the wrapper all the way down. Then peel it off completely. [2] X Research source On some bottles, the wrapper is thick plastic instead of thin metal. This might take a bit more effort, but you can slice it off the same way."
    },
    {
      "title": "Cut off the tabs securing the stopper to the bottle.",
      "content": "Cut off the tabs securing the stopper to the bottle. The stopper has plastic tabs around its border that secure it. Take the knife and insert it into each tab, then slice through them. Work your way around the stopper to release all the seals. [3] X Research source You can also use scissors to cut the tabs. This may be easier for you, and there’s less chance of cutting yourself."
    },
    {
      "title": "Lift the stopper out of the bottle.",
      "content": "Lift the stopper out of the bottle. With the tabs cut, the stopper should pop out of the bottleneck. Pull it up to remove it completely. [4] X Research source Be careful when you pull the stopper out. There won’t be anything keeping the liquor in so you could spill it if you tip the bottle. If the stopper is stuck, try using a pair of pliers to pull it out."
    },
    {
      "title": "Plug the bottle with a cork that fits into the bottleneck.",
      "content": "Plug the bottle with a cork that fits into the bottleneck. If you have an extra cork laying around, then this could be the perfect way to reseal the bottle. Push it into the bottleneck to stop up the bottle and prevent the alcohol from spilling out. [5] X Research source Don’t use a cork that doesn’t properly fit the bottle. If it’s too small, the bottle will spill. You can also buy corks online if you don’t have any extras."

    {
      "title": "Insert a metal or plastic bottle stopper.",
      "content": "Insert a metal or plastic bottle stopper. While these stoppers are normally used for wine bottles, they can seal up a liquor bottle as well. Search online for a type that fits the bottle. Then slide it into the bottleneck to create a seal. [6] X Research source Some stoppers don’t form a tight seal, so the liquid could leak out if the bottle is on its side. Always store it right-side up to avoid spills. These stoppers can be decorative as well, and some have shapes or figures on top."

    {
      "title": "Transfer the alcohol to a decanter if you can’t reseal the bottle.",
      "content": "Transfer the alcohol to a decanter if you can’t reseal the bottle. A decanter is a glass container designed to hold and seal alcohol. Insert a funnel into the decanter neck and pour the alcohol into it. This is a good way to keep your alcohol if you have trouble resealing the original bottle. [7] X Research source As long as the decanter has a good seal on it, the alcohol should last as long as it would in the original bottle."
