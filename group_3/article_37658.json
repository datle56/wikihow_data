[2] X Research source Remember, a warm and well ventilated environment is best for ripening plantains. To speed up the ripening process, place a ripe tomato or avocado in the bag with the plantains. The gases released by the ripe fruit will also speed up the ripening process for the plantains."

While the fruits look similar, plantains look much different than bananas when ripe. While you can fry or bake plantains before they're completely ripe, if you intend to eat them raw you need to wait until they're ripe. [4] X Research source Plantains are mostly black when ripe with a few yellow streaks. Plantains that are completely black are still edible, but may be a little overripe. [5] X Research source"
