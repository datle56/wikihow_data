      "title": "Netorare refers to a genre that portrays infidelity.",
      "content": "Netorare refers to a genre that portrays infidelity. The term is used to describe a genre of Japanese media that involves someone cheating on their partner, either on their own accord or through means of coercion. The cheating is often sexual in nature and sometimes the sex is non-consensual. The main character is the one getting cheated on and typically finds out over the course of the story. In some cases, the person cheating grows to enjoy the experience. [1] X Research source Ne means to sleep with someone. Torare means to have something stolen. Netorare is often loosely translated to “cuckold,” which refers to a person whose partner regularly cheats on them. The use of “NTR” as a slang abbreviation started popping up on the internet as early as 2001 when a forum user coined the term to shorten netorare. [2] X Research source Netorare is a Japanese word that translates to “to be taken off.”"

      "content": "Netorare is used to explore the dark feelings that come with affairs. Netorare (or NTR) typically explores the dark feelings that come with affairs from the perspective of the person who was cheated on. They are often extremely heartbroken, caught off guard, and filled with feelings of devastation due to the intimate nature of the cheating. Despite the dark, explicit nature of the genre, it is still enjoyed by anime watchers who like diving into the feelings that come with cheating. [3] X Research source The main character’s reaction to the cheating ranges from indifference to volatile sadness, frustration, and disgust. The cheating is usually sexual in nature, but not always. Sometimes the sex is non-consensual, which makes many viewers uncomfortable. In some netorare, the cheater’s feelings are explored, too. Some feel guilty, while others feel like the cheating is warranted."

      "content": "Netorare promotes infidelity, non-consensual sex, and plays on power dynamics. Despite the cheater going on to enjoy the unfaithful act, netorare is still problematic because it plays on power dynamics, as the person cheating is often considered weak and tends to be humiliated. It also normalizes infidelity and sexualizes non-consensual activities. The act of getting someone to cheat with you against their will is wrong, especially when mind control or coercion are utilized, as the person is unable to consent. [8] X Research source Even though some people enjoy it for the intensity and shock value, many still consider it wrong and believe it crosses boundaries. Netorare is a popular genre of pornography/hentai, but is less liked by anime and manga fans."
