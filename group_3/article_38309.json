      "content": "Shoebill storks, also known as whalehead storks, are basically dinosaurs—they have a beak shaped like a snout, they’re genetically related to the T. Rex (their Latin name is Balaeniceps rex), and they make clicking noises that sound like a machine gun . Oh, and they grow up to 5 ft (1.5 m) tall, which is super freaky on its own. If that weren’t enough, these storks use the tip of their bill to decapitate fish before swallowing them whole. [1] X Trustworthy Source National Audubon Society Nonprofit environmental organization focused on conservation, citizen science, and public science education Go to source Where to Find This Frightening Bird: Central Africa. Nightmare Vibes Level: 10/10. They’re pretty freaky looking, and if you ran into one randomly in the woods, you might think you saw an alien. Danger Level: 0/10. These birds are actually comically friendly towards people, which is partly why they’re nearly endangered—they’ll just walk right up to hunters out of curiosity. Overall Spooky Score: 5/10."

      "content": "After the condor, the king vulture is the largest New World vulture on the planet. It grows up to 2.5 ft (0.76 m) tall and has a freaky, colorful wattle that sits on top of its nostrils. [2] X Research source Like all vultures, the king vulture eats carcasses of dead animals. What makes them unique is their bite. They bite with a force of 109.9 Newtons. [3] X Research source For context, that’s a little less than the strength of a Doberman! Where to Find This Frightening Bird: Central and South America. Nightmare Vibes Level: 6/10. They actually have really beautiful, colorful feathers, but the giant tumor growing on its bill combined with the beady white eyes don’t do the bird any favors. Danger Level: 10/10 if you’re a corpse. 2/10 if you’re alive; they’ll fight if cornered, but they’re normally more interested in biting things that aren’t moving. Overall Spooky Score: 6/10."

      "content": "Marabou storks are tall birds that can grow a massive 6 ft (1.8 m) tall. They have bare necks and a massive pointed bill that they use to stab things. They also have nearly zero predators, with only hyenas and lions being able to take them out with any regularity. On top of all of that, they’re unhinged levels of aggression; they’ll attack anything that moves. [4] X Research source Oh, and they also eat almost anything—including shoes, diamonds, and chunks of metal. [5] X Research source Where to Find This Frightening Bird: Sub-Saharan Africa. Nightmare Vibes Level: 7/10. They’re tall enough to play in the NBA, which automatically scores them 5 points. The sharp bill and naked neck just add to the spook factor. Danger Level: 10/10. These are extremely aggressive birds. They’ll attack anything that gets too close, including people. In fact, they’ve been documented to kill children who accidentally stumble on them in the wild.

      "content": "The Andean Condor is the largest raptor in the world. If that sentence weren’t scary enough, it’s also the largest flying bird in South America and they have no natural predators. These giant scavengers also notably have bright, yellow eyes, so if it isn’t perfectly bright out, they look like giant shadows with piercing yellow peepers, so that’s fun. [7] X Research source Where to Find This Frightening Bird: South America (especially the Andes Mountains). Nightmare Vibes Level: 8/10. Their size alone counts for a lot, but you throw in the giant yellow eyes and it’s pure nightmare fuel. Danger Level: 0/10. These scavengers aren’t much for a fight. They prefer to be left alone and will typically flee when they encounter people. Overall Spooky Score: 4/10."

      "content": "The cassowary is an extremely violent bird. These freaky avians look dinosaur-like with their blue skin, giant head crest, and red wattles. They’re also huge. Southern cassowaries also grow 5–6 ft (1.5–1.8 m) tall and they fight like people. Literally. If a cassowary is so inclined, it will kick, bite, peck, head-butt, or jump on their target. Oh, and they’re also extremely territorial, which just makes all of this worse. [8] X Research source Where to Find This Frightening Bird: Luckily, these things only live in remote parts of Australia, New Guinea, and Indonesia. Nightmare Vibes Level: 9/10. It’s a human-sized bird with a blue head. It doesn’t get much worse. Danger Level: 10/10. For a bird, these things are dangerous. There have been over 200 documented cassowary attacks against humans, and they’ve killed multiple people. [9] X Research source Overall Spooky Score: 9.5/10."

      "content": "The great skua is probably the first bird on this list that mostly just looks like a normal bird. These solitary seabirds grow about 2 feet (0.61 m) and they have dark feathers with wide wings. But this bird’s behavior is anything but normal. Their eerie chittering call is pure demon energy, and they eat by stealing food from other birds. If the bird in question refuses to drop their catch, the great skua will simply kill the bird carrying it. They’re maybe the biggest jerks on our list. [10] X Trustworthy Source National Audubon Society Nonprofit environmental organization focused on conservation, citizen science, and public science education Go to source Where to Find This Frightening Bird: These birds spend their life at sea, and you’ll only find them in the northern Atlantic Ocean. Nightmare Vibes Level: 0/10 if they’re just on their own. 8/10 if you get to watch them murder another bird mid-air. Danger Level: 5/10. They’re aggressive meanies, so we have no doubt they’d happily peck your eye out, but there is no documented case of a great skua attack. They do, however, like to dive-bomb people to try and scare them away. [11] X Research source Overall Spooky Score: 5/10."

      "content": "These docile little guys may not be much in the fighting department, but they’re fully nocturnal and have evolved to have no iris or sclera—their eyes are entirely black pupils. They also have a terrifying call , which makes it sound like someone is screaming for help. Oh, and they can expand their beaks to open their mouths nearly 100 degrees and have holes in their eyelids so they can see with their eyes closed. [12] X Research source Where to Find This Frightening Bird: South and Central America. Nightmare Vibes Level: 10/10. It literally screams and has giant black eyes. Danger Level: 0/10. These ugly little guys just want to snuggle and be left alone. They’re totally harmless. Overall Spooky Score: 8/10. Mathematically, it should be a 5/10, but we’re awarding it 3 extra points for being that scary-looking."

[13] X Research source They also have entirely bald heads that give them this freaky look like they’re wearing giant coats. [14] X Research source They’re scary-looking scavengers, and they’re certainly nothing to mess with. Where to Find This Frightening Bird: California. Nightmare Vibes Level: 8/10. They don’t have the beady yellow eyes of the Andean Condor, but they make up for it with their weird, wrinkly, naked head. Danger Level: 2/10. They seem to be a little angrier than their South American cousins. They rarely fight or attack people, but they have been known to get territorial with people over land.

      "content": "Black vultures are iconic for their spookiness. They’ve got this hardcore speed metal aesthetic going on that just lends itself to the imagination. Part of their memorability comes from the fact that these birds tear carcasses apart when they scavenge, and they’re not shy about letting people watch. They also are known to circle potentially sick prey for hours as they wait for it to perish. [16] X Trustworthy Source The Cornell Lab of Ornithology Research lab of Cornell University dedicated to interpreting and conserving the Earth's biological diversity through research and education about birds Go to source Where to Find This Frightening Bird: South America, Central America, and the Southern portion of North America. Nightmare Vibes Level: 3/10. They’re more cool than spooky unless you happen to see them tearing a corpse apart. Danger Level: 3/10. They don’t like to fight, but they will bite if they’re annoyed. They also projectile vomit at people to fend them off, which is just super weird and off-brand for such a metal bird. [17] X Research source Overall Spooky Score: 3/10."

      "content": "Next to the black vulture, the American crow is maybe the most ominous bird on our list. They’ve been thought to be omens of death, disaster, and misfortune for centuries, and for good reason. They eat roadkill (even though they aren’t scavengers), they know how to use tools, and they’re able to hold grudges for years at a time. They even recognize and remember human faces, so be nice to any crows you come across. [18] X Research source Where to Find This Frightening Bird: North America. Nightmare Vibes Level: 4/10. They don’t really look scary, but they can behave in some really frightening ways—especially if you get on their bad side. Danger Level: 4/10. Crows will dive-bomb you if you bother them. Their commitment to beef is also a little scary. If you get into it with a crow, they will be very likely to attack you in the future if you cross paths. Overall Spooky Score: 4/10."

They’re also just kind of big. They have a wingspan of 4–5 feet (1.2–1.5 m), and they typically weigh around 3 pounds (1.4 kg), which is really big for a bird.

They rarely attack people, but they will if they’re nesting and they think you’re a danger to their young. Great horned owls have these huge talons that are strong enough to rip fingers off when you raise your hands to defend yourself, so they’re definitely not something to mess with.

      "content": "These tiny birds may not look like much, but they’re hardcore predators that bully the fish, small mammals, other birds, and insects that they eat. In fact, they love hunting so much that they kill more than they can consume in a single meal. Know what they do with their leftovers? It impales them on thorny bushes and branches to store for later. They even have a spike on the inside of their mouth they use to stab prey and they’ll wait for the animal to bleed out, earning them the nickname “butcher birds.” This is a bird that stabs everything .

      "content": "The golden eagle is a robust predator known for hunting foxes, cats, cranes, and coyotes. Part of what makes it such a scary bird is the way it decides to hunt. If it can’t easily kill a creature with its talons, it resorts to some truly psychopathic methods. If there’s a cliff nearby, the Golden Eagle will simply knock the creature off the cliff, force it to fall to its death, and then eat the remains. [22] X Research source It has even been seen picking animals up, flying high in the sky, and then dropping them to kill them. [23] X Research source Where to Find This Frightening Bird: North America. Nightmare Vibes Level: 2/10. It’s got some scary talons and a wingspan that reaches 7 ft (2.1 m), but otherwise, it just looks like a common eagle. Danger Level: 8/10. They almost never attack people, but when they do, they go hard. They’ve even killed toddlers, so they’re certainly dangerous birds. [24] X Research source Overall Spooky Score: 5/10"

      "content": "Grackles aren’t necessarily scary in a traditional sense, but they’re big enough jerks that they deserve to be included on this list. They’re pests that love to destroy crops, so farmers hate them. They steal food from other birds, so birds hate them. They make high-pitched screeching noises , so anything with ears hates them. They’re just really hate-able. They’re super aggressive, too, which makes them more than an annoyance if you enter the bird’s personal space. Where to Find This Frightening Bird: North America. Nightmare Vibes Level: 2/10. Their call is pretty spooky, and they have freaky yellow eyes, but other than that, they’re basically interchangeable with crows visually. Danger Level: 2/10. If grackles were the size of eagles, we have no doubt they’d be the most fearsome killer on the planet. Overall Spooky Score: 2/10."

Emus aren’t naturally aggressive, but they’re so big that if they do want to fight, it can get ugly. [25] X Research source So ugly, in fact, that when Australia tried to cull 20,000 emus, the emus fought back…and won . That’s right; emus won a war with Australia. [26] X Research source Where to Find This Frightening Bird: Australia. Nightmare Vibes Level: 2/10. They’re kind of alarming just based on their size, but they’re not a uniquely freaky-looking bird. Danger Level: 10/10. Emus have colossal talons that will tear someone to shreds. They’ve killed people in attacks, and they’re the only birds to win a ground war against an active military force.
