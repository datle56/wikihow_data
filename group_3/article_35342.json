      "content": "Spray soapy water onto the air conditioner components to locate leaks . You can use dish soap and tap water. Make sure the whole system is coated so that you won't miss a leak. If there are leaks, you'll see bubbles forming around the leak. [2] X Research source Spray bottles are sold at most department stores and online. You can also buy a leak detector kit from your local automotive store or online. Follow the directions for that kit."

      "title": "Watch for bubbles to appear, which indicate a leak.",
      "content": "Watch for bubbles to appear, which indicate a leak. The leak will interact with the soapy water to create foam. If you see just a few bubbles or they take a while to appear, then your leak is probably small. If you see a lot of foaming, then you probably have a big leak. [3] X Research source Big leaks will require a professional repair."

      "title": "Use a recharge kit with a sealant to repair small leaks.",
      "content": "Use a recharge kit with a sealant to repair small leaks. You can spend more than $1,000 trying to find and repair a small leak, so it’s often better to use a product that contains a sealant. This will help your system hold its recharge longer, as the refrigerant won’t leak out as quickly. Look for a product that says its sealant is a conditioner, which won’t clog your pipes. A sealant that has a goo texture can cause a clog. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Put on your eye protection and gloves. Refrigerant is very dangerous and can result in injuries. It can cause frostbite if it hits your skin. If you get it in your eyes, it can blind you. [6] X Research source Follow all instructions on the label, including additional recommended protective gear."

      "title": "Find the low-pressure line port, which will have thicker tubing.",
      "content": "Find the low-pressure line port, which will have thicker tubing. There are two ports on your air conditioner. You will add the refrigerant to the low-pressure line port, not the high-pressure line port. The low-pressure line has larger tubing than the high-pressure line, making it easy to distinguish between the 2. [7] X Research source Sometimes they are labeled with “H” for high and “L” for low. In some vehicles, the low-pressure line port will be lower than the high port, but this is not always the case. Most kits have a hookup that only fits onto the low-pressure port, making it easier to choose the right port."

Green means good, but your levels could still be lower than necessary to cool your car if it’s low in the green zone. [11] X Research source Your ideal pressure will be determined once you test the outdoor temperature. You’ll do this when you test your system later in the recharge process."

It may spin fast or slow, depending on how well your system is working, as well as how much refrigerant is present in the system. If it’s not spinning, then you can add half a can of refrigerant and check it again. If it’s still not spinning, then you’ll need to take your car in to a professional technician.

As you screw the can back on, press hard so that the metal pin pierces the top of the can. You should hear the pressure release inside the can. It will now be ready for use.

It’s important that you not put too much refrigerant into your air conditioner. [23] X Research source If your can has a knob instead of a trigger, then you should turn the knob to close the valve after 10 seconds. You’ll probably need to add refrigerant a few times to reach the desired pressure. Take your time, though, so you don’t overcharge the system. Overcharging makes your system run ineffectively and can damage it."
