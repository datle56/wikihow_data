      "title": "Make a habit of turning off all lights and electronics when not in use.",
      "content": "Make a habit of turning off all lights and electronics when not in use. Institute a “switch off when done” policy for all computers, televisions, telephones, air conditioning units, lights, and other electronics when you’re not using them. This can help you save hundreds of dollars in energy bills and reduce your energy consumption. [1] X Trustworthy Source National Resources Defence Council Multinational environmental advocacy group focused on grassroots activism and legislative action Go to source Unplug any seldom used electronics or appliances, like a mini fridge in a meeting room that’s rarely used or an old coffee grinder in your kitchen. If you are going away on vacation, unplug your electronics and appliances. If your fridge is full, empty it or leave it on so that the food doesn't spoil."

      "title": "Turn off your computer when it’s not in use.",
      "content": "Turn off your computer when it’s not in use. It is important that your computer is set to go to sleep or power down when not in use. If you plan to take a short break and go back to using your computer, allow it to hibernate rather than display a screen saver, which is a big energy waster. This should also apply to all your other computer accessories, such as printers and scanners."

      "title": "Recycle all recyclable materials.",
      "content": "Recycle all recyclable materials. Recycling paper, plastic, glass, and other items can reduce your energy consumption significantly. Set up recycling bins in your home and office to encourage others to recycle rather than trash their items. Add recycling pickup to your trash service if you don’t already have it. You can also recycle things like plastic bottles into craft projects, such as coin purses. The recycling rules will vary from city to city, so check with your city. Some places require you to sort items while others do not."

      "title": "Decorate your space in light colors.",
      "content": "Decorate your space in light colors. Choosing pale colors for your walls, ceilings, and floors will actually reflect more light into the space. Select a high-gloss paint for walls to reflect even more light! These steps will allow you to take advantage of natural daylight, as well as use lower-wattage lightbulbs when you need to turn the lights on. This also has an advantage in the summer, because the walls won't absorb as much heat."

      "title": "Use a smart thermostat.",
      "content": "Use a smart thermostat. Smart thermostats can be controlled from an application on your mobile phone or tablet, allowing you to change the temperature when you’re away from the house. They also have multiple sensors that provide a better overall reading of the temperature in your home and heat or cool your home more efficiently than regular thermostats. [4] X Research source Smart thermostats also send you reports about your energy usage so you can be more in tune with how much energy you are using."

      "title": "Choose energy-efficient appliances.",
      "content": "Choose energy-efficient appliances. Look for the Energy Star label on appliances like refrigerators, freezers, ovens, dishwashers, desktop computers, laptops, printers, and scanners, which indicates that these appliances are energy efficient. Switching your electronics to those with an Energy Star label can significantly reduce your energy consumption and therefore your energy bills. [5] X Trustworthy Source National Resources Defence Council Multinational environmental advocacy group focused on grassroots activism and legislative action Go to source An Energy Star label signifies that an appliance is more energy-efficient than 75% of other appliances, therefore saving energy and money. If you live outside the U.S., contact appliance manufacturers or local government officials to find out about similar ratings or programs in your area."

      "title": "Use your refrigerator and oven efficiently.",
      "content": "Use your refrigerator and oven efficiently. Adjust your refrigerator temperature to 38 to 42 °F (3 to 6 °C) and your freezer temperature to 0 to 5 °F (−18 to −15 °C). Check that the seal on the oven door is intact and avoid peeking in the oven more than necessary, as this lets out heat and increases the cooking time. [6] X Trustworthy Source National Resources Defence Council Multinational environmental advocacy group focused on grassroots activism and legislative action Go to source If your fridge has a power-save switch, make sure it is on, and always check that the door seals tightly. Use your microwave, rather than your oven, for reheating small items."

      "title": "Use your washing machine and dryer efficiently.",
      "content": "Use your washing machine and dryer efficiently. Set your washing machine to wash your clothes in cold water, which can save you up to 50 cents per load while still cleaning your clothes effectively. Always clean the lint out of the filter of the dryer after each use, and remember to dry heavy and light fabrics separately. Use the highest spin cycle on your washing machine, as the high spin speeds remove more moisture and reduce the time needed to dry clothing. If possible, invest in a front-loading washer as they save more water and energy than top-loading washers. Consider buying a high-efficiency washing machine. These are designed to save water and require less detergent."

      "title": "Ensure your home is well-insulated.",
      "content": "Ensure your home is well-insulated. Having a well-insulated home will reduce the amount of energy needed to heat or cool the area. Check the insulation around your home, especially in your attic. If needed, add more insulation to your roof/ceiling, attic, or basement to ensure your home is as energy-efficient as possible. [7] X Research source If your home is not well-insulated, it will trap more heat in the summer, and lose heat in the winter. This will require you to spend more energy on heating and air conditioning."

      "title": "Reduce your water usage.",
      "content": "Reduce your water usage. Saving water also reduces the amount of energy needed to purify or heat it. Limit your shower time and turn off the faucet when brushing your teeth. You can also make sure to wash only full loads of laundry and dishes in order to save water and energy used to heat the water. Installing low-flush toilets and low-volume faucets will also dramatically reduce your water usage. Avoid pre-washing your dishes before you put them in the dishwasher. Limit the amount of time sprinklers are on, and make sure to only water grassy areas, rather than overspraying onto sidewalks or parking lots."

      "content": "Shut down all equipment at the end of the day. Turn off copiers, fax machines, computers, and other electrical equipment every night when you leave the office. Don’t forget to turn off the lights in bathrooms, meetings rooms, and offices. Gently remind your coworkers to do the same. [8] X Trustworthy Source National Resources Defence Council Multinational environmental advocacy group focused on grassroots activism and legislative action Go to source You should also do this when leaving for the weekend or vacation. Say something like: \"These computers use a lot of energy when we aren't using them. Let's try turning them off for the night to save energy and electricity bills.\""

      "content": "Reduce paper waste by printing only what is necessary. Avoid printing out emails, memos, and other information unless absolutely necessary. You’ll reduce energy consumption by using the printer less, which will, in turn, extend its life. If you do need to print something, use both sides of the paper. [9] X Research source For example, send memos around the office by email or use a tablet for your presentation notes. Save any memos that you print out and post in the break room. Use the blank side to print the next memo on. This way, you can use the same sheet of paper twice!"

      "title": "Recycle old electronic equipment.",
      "content": "Recycle old electronic equipment. Rather than tossing out old phones, computers, and copiers, recycle these items instead. This saves energy because materials for new electronics can be repurposed and recycled from old ones, rather than made from scratch. You may have to perform an Internet search to find e-waste recycling programs in your area."

      "content": "Organize a carpool, ride your bike, or take public transit to the office. You can cut down on your energy use by adjusting your daily commute. Carpooling with coworkers will keep one more car off the road and reduce the amount of energy you use via fuel. Public transit is also a great way to limit your energy consumption, and many city buses run on eco-friendly fuel. Walking or biking to work every day is a great opportunity to get in some exercise. Bring a change of clothes, or even toiletries if you can shower at the office, in case you get sweaty or dirty on the commute."

      "title": "Plant trees as holiday gifts.",
      "content": "Plant trees as holiday gifts. Rather than giving traditional gifts to your clients, plant a tree in their name instead. Planting trees reduces energy consumption by eliminating the need for materials that would be used for traditional gifts and wrapping paper, and is also great for the environment. If you plant them near the building, the shade provided can even reduce the amount of air conditioning needed to cool the office in the warmer months!"
