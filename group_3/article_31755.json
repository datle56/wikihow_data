      "title": "Put a pencil halfway into the pouch and push down on the fabric.",
      "content": "Put a pencil halfway into the pouch and push down on the fabric. Come from the side and place the pencil into the pouch close to the pin. Then, leverage the pencil up so it’s facing the ceiling. Once the pencil is secure, push down on top of the fabric on both sides of the pencil. As you push, the pouch will gradually loosen to the point where you can open it like normal. [1] X Research source Damage: May stab or mark the fabric. Efficiency: Typically opens after a few pushes. Works best with older pouches. Be careful not to damage the pin as you open the pouch. You can also use a pen for this step, just make sure it doesn’t leave behind any ink stains."

      "title": "Wedge a flat surface into the opening and hit the pouch until it opens.",
      "content": "Wedge a flat surface into the opening and hit the pouch until it opens. Find a flat, durable surface like a counter, table, or the back of a chair. Then, wedge the flat surface into the opening of your Yondr pouch until it feels secure. Once the pouch is secure, firmly bang the back of the pouch until the snap pops open. Be careful to not damage your phone in the process. [2] X Research source Damage: May dent the metal ring. Efficiency: Typically opens after a few hits. This method is loud, so cover your ears and let the people around you know what you’re up to before trying to open the pouch."

      "title": "Use a sharp object to cut the seam below the locking mechanism.",
      "content": "Use a sharp object to cut the seam below the locking mechanism. Choose a fairly sharp object, like a key or sewing needle, and run it across the second seam below the locking mechanism, which is located on the front and back of the pouch. Run the object across the seam multiple times to ensure it cuts open. [3] X Research source Damage: Cuts the fabric, rendering the pouch useless. Efficiency: Typically opens after running the object across the seam a few times. You can also use scissors for this step, but be careful. Using an object that’s too sharp may cause you to accidentally damage your phone."

      "title": "Get your hands on a neodymium magnet.",
      "content": "Get your hands on a neodymium magnet. A neodymium magnet (also known as a fishing magnet) works best for opening a Yondr pouch when you don’t have the original opener handy. Head to your local hardware store and check to see if they have them in stock. If you can’t find one in-store, order the magnet online. The shape of the magnet doesn’t matter as much as the type of magnet. A cube or spherical magnet will work just fine as long as it’s neodymium. Get a magnet that you can grip onto."

      "title": "Place the magnet onto the closing snap and pull the pouch open.",
      "content": "Place the magnet onto the closing snap and pull the pouch open. Once you have your hands on a neodymium magnet, place it onto the circular closing snap opposite from where the metal pin is housed, then pull the other side of the pouch. If it doesn’t open on the first try, press the magnet back onto the snap and repeat this step. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "If you’re in school, you may face disciplinary action. Depending on your school or district’s rules, breaking a Yondr pouch may result in serious disciplinary action. This disciplinary action may range from community service to detention or in-school suspension, depending on the rules and how often you get in trouble. You may also be responsible for replacing the Yondr pouch if your school finds out you broke it. [5] X Research source If you break the Yondr pouch in school, an administrator will typically come to collect it and call home so your parent or guardian can come pick up your phone. If you lose or damage your Yondr pouch, your school may be able to issue you a new one. You may have to purchase it depending on your school’s policies."

      "content": "If you’re at a public event that requires them, you may get kicked out. Many events that use Yondr pouches require you to keep your phone in one, whether it be due to the artist’s discretion or the risk of recording actors or performers without their consent. [6] X Research source So, if you break open a Yondr pouch and get caught using your phone when you shouldn’t be, you may end up getting kicked out of the venue."

      "content": "You won’t be able to reuse the pouch in the future. If you cut the pouch open or damage the pin holding the snap together, you'll essentially break the Yondr pouch you won’t be able to reuse it. If the pouch is cut open, it will no longer function as a lock for your phone since you can dig in and grab it, anyway. And since the pin relies on magnetic technology, if you damage it, it won’t be able to lock at all. [7] X Research source"

Schools and public events that use Yondr pouches usually require you to put your phone in them to attend class or enjoy the event. However, there are various petitions online trying to stop the use of Yondr pouches, arguing that Yondr pouches prevent them from being able to call 911 or their parents in the case of an emergency.

While you won’t be able to scroll or use your phone as you normally would, it will be fine and fully functional once it’s removed from the pouch. Yondr pouches are designed to protect your phone too, as the soft pouch protects it like a case would if you were to ever drop it. [9] X Research source In schools, phones are expected to be turned off or put in Do Not Disturb while they’re in Yondr pouches."
