      "content": "Pack some water and snacks to fuel you during the day. Whether or not you bring your own lunch, it’s a good idea to bring extra snacks in case you get hungry before or after lunchtime. If your school allows it, pack a zip-top bag or a small plastic container with some healthy snacks, like cut-up fruit, carrot sticks, or crackers. [3] X Research source Put some water in a lightweight, spill-proof bottle or thermos so you can take a sip when you get thirsty. [4] X Research source Pick a reusable water bottle that you can refill easily from a water fountain at school. Not only will you waste less plastic, but you’ll never have to worry about running out of water! [5] X Research source If you bring your own lunch, pack it in an insulated lunchbox that won’t leak inside your bag."

      "content": "Put a sweater or jacket in your bag in case it gets chilly. You never know when you might get cold during the day. Pack a light sweater, jacket, or hoodie that you can easily roll up and fit in your backpack. You might also pack a pair of gym shoes, although you can probably leave them at school most of the time. If you’re worried about getting your period by surprise, pack a change of underwear and some pants you can easily fit into your bag, like some light leggings. That way, you can change in case you have a leak."

If you’re going to school during the coronavirus pandemic, you might need to pack a couple of extra supplies to stay safe and healthy. Put at least 2 masks in your bag, and pack a small bottle of hand sanitizer in case the hand cleaning stations at your school run out. [8] X Research source Keep your masks inside a paper bag inside your backpack to keep them from getting lost or dirty. Put a label on the bag and write your name on it so it doesn’t get mixed up with anyone else’s stuff when you take it out."

A bag with lots of compartments will help keep the weight more balanced, so it doesn’t hurt your back and shoulders. Plus, it’ll be easier to find your stuff when you need it! [9] X Research source Look for a bag with at least 2 big main compartments, plus smaller pockets for items that might get easily buried or crushed. A lot of backpacks have side compartments that are great for carrying water bottles or thermoses. You can use smaller pockets for carrying stuff like chargers, pencil cases, and little odds and ends like Chapstick or change for the vending machine."

      "content": "Keep little items in smaller containers so they don’t get lost. Don’t just let your pencils and spare change roll around loose in your backpack. Instead, put little items in smaller bags or cases so you can keep them all together. For example, you can: [10] X Research source Put pens, pencils, markers, erasers, and other writing stuff in a pencil case or pouch. Keep your spare change, lunch card, and school ID in a wallet or change purse. Put your hand sanitizer, tissues, and hairbrush in a zipper pouch. Organize loose papers into folders by subject."

If you keep related items together, you’ll have an easier time finding them in your bag! For example: [11] X Trustworthy Source Understood Nonprofit organization dedicated to resources and support to people with thinking differences, such as ADHD or dyslexia Go to source Put writing supplies like pens, pencils, erasers, and highlighters together. If you have different classes, keep your books and folders for those classes together. Bundle your chargers, headphones, and other electronic accessories together in one group. Decide which compartment on your backpack will hold which types of items so you won’t have to guess when you’re looking for them! For example, you might put your pencils and other writing stuff in the right side compartment, and your chargers on the left."

That way, it won’t hurt your back or throw you off balance. [12] X Research source Putting heavy items in first will also help prevent smaller and more fragile things from getting buried or crushed."

To help balance the load and prevent little or fragile things from getting squashed, put your smaller items into different compartments. [13] X Research source For example, you could: Put your folders in the outer back pocket. Keep your water bottle in one of the side compartments. Place pencils or other writing supplies in a smaller pocket. Keep really fragile items, like your cell phone, in inside pockets higher up in the bag. That way, they’re less likely to get crushed."

      "content": "Use soft items to pad fragile things. You can protect smaller items or keep them from shifting around by packing softer items around or on top of them. For example, pad your tablet by packing your sweater or hoodie between it and other items in the same compartment. Some backpacks also have straps, loops, or mesh pockets inside that can help hold small items in place."

If there’s a book you don’t really need on a particular day, don’t bring it! Not going to gym today? Leave your sneakers at home. [14] X Research source If you have a locker or cubby at school, leave stuff in there that you don’t have to bring home every day. For example, you could keep your gym shoes in there. You can also unload your heavy books and put them in your locker as soon as you get to school."

      "content": "Make sure the load is no more than 10% of your weight. No matter how carefully you balance all that stuff, a backpack that’s just too heavy can still hurt your back. Once you pack your bag, weigh it on a scale or ask an adult to help you. If it weighs more than about 10% of what you weigh, take some stuff out and check again. [15] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source To find 10% of your weight, multiply how much you weigh by 0.1. For example, if you weigh 95 pounds (43 kg), 10% of that would be 9.5 pounds (4.3 kg). If you absolutely have to bring a super heavy load of stuff to school, get a backpack with wheels so that you can pull it behind you instead of wearing it!"
