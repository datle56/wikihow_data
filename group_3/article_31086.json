      "title": "Geminis are thought to be two-faced and unreliable.",
      "content": "Geminis are thought to be two-faced and unreliable. As a mutable sign ruled by Mercury (the planet of communication), Gemini is great at changing to fit the vibe of whatever person they’re talking to. This leaves a lot of people feeling like they can never fully trust a Gemini. Hence, there is a belief that the twins who represent Gemini portray each of Gemini’s “faces” and mercurial personalities. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "In reality, Geminis are adaptable and spontaneous.",
      "content": "In reality, Geminis are adaptable and spontaneous. Because of their keen communication abilities, Gemini has a natural gift for seeing everyone’s thought process. This doesn’t mean they lack loyalty or don’t have their own principles. They’re just great at adapting their personalities to make each unique person feel comfortable opening up. Whether you're dating a Gemini or just have one as a friend, you'll soon see just how fun they are to be around! Wondering what wikiHow users have to say about the “best” and “worst” zodiac signs?

      "title": "People think Scorpios are cold and manipulative.",
      "content": "People think Scorpios are cold and manipulative. Like the scorpions that represent them, people think Scorpios are edgy, just waiting to sting those around them. Ruled by Mars (the planet of aggression), Scorpio’s main weakness is being untrusting, and sometimes even combative. But, because Scorpio is a water sign, they’re also incredibly great at picking up on emotional cues. This combination can make certain Scorpio interactions feel invasive and probing, according to Eyedealism."

    {
      "title": "However, Scorpios are sweet and emotionally aware.",
      "content": "However, Scorpios are sweet and emotionally aware. Nobody embodies the phrase “still waters run deep” more than Scorpio. As a water sign, they feel things intensely, but use their calm demeanor and deadpan humor as a defense mechanism for the deep well of emotion that swirls inside them. If you spend enough time with a Scorpio, though, the waters of this well are replenishing. Scorpios are patient, empathetic, and wonderful listeners. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Leos",
      "content": "Leos are disliked for their drama and arrogance. Ruled by the sun, Leos are bright and can feel like they want the world to revolve around them. When this attention is not met, they get frustrated, and their fiery nature comes out. They can become aggressive and temperamental, and their passion will stir the pot. Lots of people feel Leos are self-obsessed, and as fixed signs, their “my way or the highway” mentality only aggravates this belief, affirms Eyedealism."

    {
      "title": "But we need Leos for their creativity and bright spirit.",
      "content": "But we need Leos for their creativity and bright spirit. Leo’s fiery natures also make them great leaders and friends. Their courage to stand out from the crowd means they’ll stand up for people when nobody else will and voice things everyone else is afraid to. They’re also one of the most giving zodiac signs and their generosity is inspirational. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Virgos",
      "content": "Virgos alienate people with how judgmental they sometimes are. Ruling the sixth house of service, Virgos love to “heal” people, start new projects, and help people become better versions of themselves. This all seems great in theory, but over time, it can feel like nothing is enough for them. Their constant desire to improve makes them come off as restless, like they see those closest to them as inadequate. [4] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "The truth is that Virgos just care a whole lot.",
      "content": "The truth is that Virgos just care a whole lot. Kindness and virtue are embedded in Virgo's nature. Their desire to help people grow is rarely rooted in any mean-spirited dissatisfaction. They’re mutable signs ruled by Mercury; they just want to communicate the best ways to adapt. Spending time with a Virgo is healing as long as you trust them and don’t take their ambitions personally."

      "title": "People think Aries is jealous and temperamental.",
      "content": "People think Aries is jealous and temperamental. The youngest on the zodiac's chart, Aries’ childlike nature can be frustrating. They have mood swings where they act petty and emotional. Plus, since they’re ruled by the aggressive Mars, they can be very protective. This can feel territorial and, with their fiery element, things can get explosive. [5] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "In reality, Aries is just bold and direct with emotions.",
      "content": "In reality, Aries is just bold and direct with emotions. Aries’ straightforwardness is also refreshing. Aries doesn’t have time to manipulate or beat around the bush. When Aries likes you , they’ll make it known. As Eyedealism explains, they don’t hold grudges and their fiery passion brings joy wherever they go."

      "title": "Taurus is often seen as too stubborn and boring.",
      "content": "Taurus is often seen as too stubborn and boring. As an Earth sign, Taurus is all about the pragmatic and practical. Their approaches to life are rarely the most creative, the most unique, or the most friendly. On top of that, Taurus is fixed, meaning they’re very set in their ways and leave little room for spontaneity, adds Eyedealism. Reader Poll: We asked 827 wikiHow readers what the most negative traits in Taureans are, and 56% of them said stubbornness and resistance to change. [Take Poll]"

      "title": "But Taurus’ steadiness makes life better.",
      "content": "But Taurus’ steadiness makes life better. Because they’re so driven by routine, Taurus is the most reliable sign in the entire zodiac. Once you’ve earned Taurus’ trust, they will always have your back, and their pragmatism makes them highly accomplished. They may not be visionaries, but Taurus will help you see your goals through and be by your side every step of the way. Plus, they have high-quality taste! [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Libras",
      "content": "Libras can be seen as shallow and indecisive. Ruled by Venus, the planet of beauty, Libra loves attractive people and status symbols. Symbolized by the scales, they’re also known for providing balance by seeing both sides of every argument. However, this flip-floppiness can eventually grow tiresome, and their obsession with prestige and aesthetics can feel superficial, notes Eyedealism."

      "title": "However, Libra’s diplomacy is unmatched.",
      "content": "However, Libra’s diplomacy is unmatched. Libra is sensitive and insightful. A cardinal air sign, they’re able to communicate effectively, but aren’t all-over-the-place like Gemini or in their head like Aquarius. Plus, they have an exaltation in Saturn (the planet of responsibility), which means they know how to put others first and problem solve better than almost anyone. [7] X Research source"

      "title": "People think Capricorn is overly serious and cynical.",
      "content": "People think Capricorn is overly serious and cynical. Ruled by Saturn , the planet of restriction and responsibility, Capricorn is obsessed with duty and is often described as the workaholic of the zodiac. Add on the fact that they’re fixed signs, meaning that Capricorn rarely factors in others’ opinions when it comes to their work. Sometimes, this Earth sign gets accused of zapping the fun out of a situation."

    {
      "title": "Yet, Capricorn’s sense of responsibility keeps the world moving.",
      "content": "Yet, Capricorn’s sense of responsibility keeps the world moving. On the flip side, Capricorn’s Saturnian rulership means they’re great judges of character. They’re unafraid of commitment and are masters of self-improvement and longevity. They’re the opposite of “here for a good time, not a long time,” and, while that mantra isn’t always great for parties, somebody’s gotta handle the hard stuff. That somebody is Capricorn.

    {
      "title": "Aquarius",
      "content": "Aquarius is confusing and sometimes even hypocritical. Oftentimes described as aliens, Aquarius is hard to grasp. As an air sign, they love intellectual challenge and going against the grain. However, as fixed signs, they’re fiercely independent and often fail to see others’ point of view. This can be frustrating to their friends and family, Eyedealism explains, as it makes them feel like two different people at once—each with completely opposite values."

    {
      "title": "But Aquarius’ dichotomy makes them unique.",
      "content": "But Aquarius’ dichotomy makes them unique. Ruled by two planets, the restrictive Saturn and the revolutionary Uranus, dichotomy is ingrained in the Aquarian experience. While it can feel disconcerting, learning to co-exist with both parts of Aquarius can help you learn to master two parts of yourself at once. Their Saturnian rule teaches pragmatism and stability, while their Uranian rule promotes innovation and individuality. [9] X Research source"

      "content": "Pisces struggles to mind their own business. A water sign co-ruled by Jupiter’s higher sense of purpose, Pisces is highly emotional and feels called on to sympathize with everything around them. But not everyone wants to be sympathized with all the time. Highly receptive, Pisces will often pick, prod, and offer insight into your situation, even when you didn’t ask for any."

    {
      "title": "A Pisces’ wisdom is insightful, though.",
      "content": "A Pisces’ wisdom is insightful, though. Pisces is intuitive like no other sign. The oldest of the zodiacal charts, Pisces offers awe-inspiring enlightenment to those closest to them. Like a sage, their emotional intensity and focus on the higher self may teach you to do things you never thought possible. [10] X Research source"

      "title": "People think Cancers are overly sensitive.",
      "content": "People think Cancers are overly sensitive. A cardinal water sign, Cancer is easily the most emotional sign of the entire zodiac. They’re quick to emotionally react to things and don’t have the thickest skin. Their moon domicile also makes them very reflective. The energy you give them will come back at you tenfold. [11] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "But this sensitivity also makes Cancer sweet and supportive.",
      "content": "But this sensitivity also makes Cancer sweet and supportive. Cancer’s watery ways make them extremely loving people to date or be friends with. The polar opposite of Capricorn, who is often distrustful of emotion, Cancer believes in feeling everything deeply. They’re excellent caretakers with extraordinary maternal instincts."

      "title": "Sagittarius changes constantly.",
      "content": "Sagittarius changes constantly. As a mutable fire sign, Sagittarius is extremely passionate. But what they’re passionate about changes rapidly. Highly adaptable, Sagittarius isn’t inhibited by the ego of admitting they’re wrong. However, this can make it extremely hard to gauge where they stand. Their intense opinions are always evolving, and their constant movement (they rule the ninth house of travel) means it’s hard to keep them in the same place intellectually, emotionally, or physically.

      "title": "However, their optimism is infectious.",
      "content": "However, their optimism is infectious. Ruled by Jupiter, the planet of expansion, Sagittarius is intuitive and inherently lucky. They take all negatives as learning lessons and believe, at their core, that things will work out. And, because they’re so naturally charismatic, if you spend enough time with a Sag, you’ll find yourself looking at the glass half-full just as often as they do."
