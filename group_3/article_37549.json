      "content": "Make double-brewed tea. Some people use the term 'double-brewed' tea to refer to concentrated tea that has been steeped twice, but the phrase can also be used to mean tea that has been brewed with reused teabags. Simply leave the teabags in the water for 2-3 minutes longer than usual to account for the loss of effectiveness. You should not reuse teabags in this manner more than once or twice. If you are not planning on reusing them right away, put them in the refrigerator in enough water to keep them completely wet. Storing used teabags at room temperature or in dry conditions can cause mold growth and invite unwanted bacteria. [1] X Research source"
