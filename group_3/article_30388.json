      "content": "Budget time for each question or section of the test. Give yourself a minute to divide the test into smaller parts, then decide how much time you’ll give yourself for each section. Make your plan based on how long it will take to answer the questions—essay questions and short answer problems might take longer, while true/false and multiple choice might go faster. [1] X Research source For instance, if you have to write 2 essays and answer 50 multiple choice questions, you might dedicate the first half of the test to the multiple choice and divide the second half equally between the essays. Don’t forget to give yourself a few minutes at the end of the test to go over your answers! If all of the questions are a similar format, like all essay questions or all multiple choice, you might divide the total time by the number of questions in the exam so you know about how much time you can spend answering each question.

      "content": "Don't spend more time than you planned on any one section. It can be tempting to spend just a few more minutes wrapping up an essay or a little extra time trying to solve one last equation, but remember that doing that will cut your time short in another section. Instead, if you've budgeted 20 minutes for a section, move to the next section as soon as that time is up. If you have time left over at the end or you finish another section more quickly than you planned, you can always go back and work on the previous sections a little longer. [3] X Research source If you notice yourself falling behind your planned time, focus on the questions in the section that you know you can answer. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Give yourself 1-2 minutes to skim through the entire test. That way, you'll know what to expect. Take stock of how many questions there are and the different types of questions you need to answer before you dive into answering. [5] X Research source As you're doing this, pay attention to the questions you feel confident you'll be able to answer. You might even want to make a mark beside these so you can complete them first. [6] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Start with the section you're most confident about.",
      "content": "Start with the section you're most confident about. It can help to start out with a part of the test that you feel like you really understand well. Not only will this boost your confidence, but you'll likely be able to answer the question in this section more quickly, leaving you extra time for a section you might need to think a little more about. [7] X Research source This is especially helpful for reading tests that ask questions about a specific passage. If you do the easy questions first, chances are, you’ll have more information to answer the tough questions later on. In addition, if you start out with the hardest questions, you might run out of time—so you might miss points on questions that you definitely would have gotten right if you'd done them first. If you prefer, you can also start with questions that carry the most weight. For instance, if an essay question counts for 50% of your score, you might decide to work on that first, then spend the remainder of your time answering the shorter questions."

      "content": "Finish with anything you skipped the first time through. Once you've taken care of all of the questions you feel confident about, answer as many tough questions as you can. Remember to keep an eye on your time for this, as well—if you really feel stuck, skip to the next question. At the very end of the test, if you still have time, you can look back over the hardest questions that you're not as sure about. [8] X Research source Don't forget to come back to the questions later! Try circling them or starring the page as a reminder that you still need to answer those ones.

      "content": "Take a few minutes to plan out your approach. Although making an outline takes a little extra time, having a plan can actually help you work through your essay a lot faster. It will be easier for you to stay on track while you're writing, so you'll be less likely to spend time discussing irrelevant details. Spend about 3-5 minutes jotting down the main points you want to make, including a couple of supporting details, then flesh it all out once you start writing. [9] X Research source Remember to leave a few minutes to write a conclusion that sums up all of your main points—a strong conclusion will make your essay seem a lot more impressive!"

      "content": "Double-check for errors and try to answer any questions that are left. Instead of turning in your test early, use any extra time to look over your test one more time. Double-check any questions that were super tough and reread your answers to check for errors. [10] X Research source If your test is hand-written, make sure all your words are legible and that there aren’t any spelling errors. Small mistakes like these can add up. If you do finish early, that’s fine! Just make sure you’ve checked your answers before you turn in your test."

      "title": "This can help you feel more comfortable working under a deadline.",
      "content": "This can help you feel more comfortable working under a deadline. Ask your instructor ahead of time if there are any practice tests that would be helpful. Then, work through the practice test exactly how you'd take an exam during class—don't use your notes, and set a timer. That way, you'll have some practice taking timed tests, so you might not get as nervous during your exam. [11] X Research source Be sure to ask about the format of the test, too—like whether you'll be answering true/false, multiple-choice, fill-in-the-blank, or essay questions. If you'll have essay questions, practice answering timed sample questions as well. Especially pay attention to your penmanship if the essay will be handwritten—you'll lose marks on an essay if the person grading it can't read all of the words!"

Then, give yourself plenty of time to get to your class or testing center before the test starts. If you're rushing around at the last minute to find a pencil, gather up your scratch paper for notes, and get to your desk, you'll feel hurried and disorganized from the very beginning of the test. [12] X Research source If you're taking an online test, log into the testing portal early to make sure you don't have any technical problems. You might also want to test your wi-fi connection, as well as your webcam and microphone if you'll need them."

The person giving the exam may tell you important information like how many essay questions you need to answer, whether any questions count as extra credit, or how much time you'll have for each section. Even if you're feeling a little nervous about the test, take a few deep breaths and listen carefully to the specifics so you know exactly what you need to do. [13] X Research source If any of the instructions seem unclear, raise your hand and ask the instructor to clarify whatever is confusing you. The instructions might also be written at the top of the test, so be sure to read any introductory material before you start the exam!"

      "content": "Take your time so you know exactly what it's asking. Sometimes, your instructor will word questions in a way that could be tricky or confusing unless you read the question carefully. Read every word of the question carefully before you answer it. If you go too fast, you could misunderstand the question and answer incorrectly, so this is really important. [14] X Research source Read the answers carefully, too, so you choose the right one. Sometimes, certain words in the question will give you clues to how you should answer. Especially pay attention to phrases like \"analyze\" or \"compare and contrast.\" [15] X Research source"

You might be feeling a little anxious or want to hurry up and get the test over with, but time management is about pacing yourself. Focus on accuracy instead of speed.
