The following terms will be used throughout the examples, and are common in problems involving algebraic fractions: [1] X Research source Numerator: The top part of a fraction (ie. (x+5) /(2x+3)). Denominator: The bottom part of the fraction (ie. (x+5)/ (2x+3) ). Common Denominator: This is a number that you can divide out of both the top and bottom of a fraction. For example, in the fraction 3/9, the common denominator is 3, since both numbers can be divided by 3. Factor: One number that multiples to make another. For example, the factors of 15 are 1, 3, 5, and 15. The factors of 4 are 1, 2, and 4. Simplified Equation: This involves removing all common factors and grouping similar variables together (5x + x = 6x) until you have the most basic form of a fraction, equation, or problem. If you cannot do anything more to the fraction, it is simplified."

In order to simplify a fraction, we need to find a common denominator. In this case, both numbers can be divided by five, so you can remove the 5 from the fraction: 15 → 5 * 3 35 → 5 * 7 Now you can cross out like terms. In this case you can cross out the two fives, leaving your simplified answer, 3/7."

[3] X Research source In the previous example, you could easily remove the 5 from 15, and the same principle applies to more complex expressions like, 15x – 5. Find a factor that both numbers have in common. Here, the answer is 5, since you can divide both 15x and -5 by the number five. Like before, remove the common factor and multiply it by what is “left.” 15x – 5 = 5 * (3x – 1) To check your work, simply multiply the five back into the new expression – you will end up with the same numbers you started with."

[4] X Research source Take the fraction: (x+2)(x-3) (x+2)(x+10) Notice how the term (x+2) is common in both the numerator (top) and denominator (bottom). As such, you can remove it to simplify the algebraic fraction, just like you removed the 5 from 15/35: (x+2) (x-3) → (x-3) (x+2) (x+10) → (x+10) This leaves us with our final answer: (x-3)/(x+10)"

There is a common factor to both 9x and -3: 3. Factor out the 3 like you would any other number, leaving you with 3 * (3x-1). This is your new numerator: 3(3x-1) 15x+6"

Thus, the example is fully simplified, making the final answer: (3x-1) (5x+2)"

For example, let’s say we have the equation: 3(x-4) 5(4-x) Notice how (x-4) and (4-x) are ‘’almost’’ identical, but you can’t cross them out because they are reversed. However, (x - 4) can be written as -1 * (4 - x) in the same way that you rewrite (4 + 2x) as 2 * (2 + x). This is called “factoring out the negative.” -1 * 3(4-x) 5(4-x) Now we can easily remove the two identical (4-x): -1 * 3 (4-x) 5 (4-x) Leaving us with our final answer -3/5"
