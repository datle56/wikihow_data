      "content": "A “sigma face” is a goofy meme poking fun at the idea of a sigma male. The facial expression is based on the idea that Christian Bale’s character, Patrick Bateman from American Psycho (2000), matches the description of a “ sigma male .” In the movie, Patrick makes a very distinct “Oooh” face after Paul Allen (Jared Leto) calls him a “loser”—and that face has become known as a “sigma face.” [1] X Research source Sigma males are usually described as mysterious, quiet, and powerful. They share a lot of qualities with alpha males , except that sigmas tend to be introverted (rather than extroverted like alphas). Bateman is a villainous character (a serial killer) with traits like a sigma male. The facial expression he makes in the movie is pretty silly, which is why the sigma face trend is used to poke fun at sigma male culture."

      "content": "In slang terms, \"sigma\" refers to a self-assured and successful man. The usual traits of a sigma male include self-reliance, independence, introversion, and a knack for success. Sigma males are like the stereotypical “lone wolves”—they’re attractive, magnetic, and masculine, but they tend to keep to themselves. As mentioned above, they’re compared to introverted alpha males. [2] X Research source While these traits aren’t inherently negative, “sigma male culture” is often associated with toxic masculinity and harmful stereotypes—just like the concept of “alpha” and “ beta ” men. Going back to the “sigma face” meme, Patrick Bateman is also an independent and attractive “lone wolf”-type, making him the perfect example of a problematic sigma male.

Make an exaggerated “sad” expression, with the corners of your mouth pointing down and the inner ends of your eyebrows higher than the outer ends. Then, once you have the expression, straighten your mouth (so it’s no longer frowning, but your upper face stays the same). [3] X Research source"

In December 2023, creator @greapaxcherri posted a video in which she impresses her excitable date and then pulls a female sigma face in response. In January 2024, @greapaxcherri posted another video featuring the female sigma face, which went viral with over 100 million views in under 2 weeks.

That’s right, there’s even a Roblox version of the sigma face—and it was featured in a TikTok video by user @zaren_delacruz in January 2024. The Roblox sigma face basically looks like a slanted half-smile with scrunched eyebrows, a slight pout, and a sharp line representing cheekbones. Currently, if you search for “sigma face” on the Roblox Marketplace , you’ll find a ton of creations, including some featuring images of the original Christian Bale-Patrick Bateman face."

Now, there are image-based memes on other social media platforms like Reddit, either referencing the face or featuring Patrick Bateman’s iconic expression. For example: Reddit user Training-Internal669 posted a meme with a drowsy-looking Winnie the Pooh labeled “Binge-watching Netflix and 1 AM face” and a fancy Pooh labeled “sigma face” (because Pooh’s expression looks like a sigma face). Reddit user idont_knowwattoput posted a meme with an image of the Greek Sigma symbol and Patrick Bateman captioned “So glad I grew up with this [the symbol] and not this [Bateman].”"
