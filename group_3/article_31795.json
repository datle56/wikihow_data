      "content": "Fill the clear tank on the side of the machine halfway with water. The water tank is the clear cylinder on the side of the Magimix Nespresso machine. On some models, this water tank will be on the back of the machine. Open the lid on the top of this tank and fill it at least halfway with water. [1] X Research source You can use standard tap water, bottled water, or purified water. While there’s nothing wrong with tap water, bottled or purified water will make better-tasting coffee!"

      "content": "Empty the pod receptacle by pulling the front of the machine out. The pod receptacle is located on the front of your machine, just under the spout where the coffee comes out. Grab this panel by its side and gently slide it out to access the pod receptacle. If it’s full of used pods, dump them in the trash or set them aside for recycling . If it isn’t full, you don’t need to empty it. Slide the panel back into the machine. [2] X Research source The size of the receptacle is different depending on the model. The Nespresso pods are pretty small, so most machines can hold at least 10-15 pods. Empty the machine out every week to ensure that the receptacle doesn’t fill up and jam. When your machine is done brewing a cup of coffee or espresso, the pod automatically drops into the receptacle the next time you open the machine. If you can’t open the machine to put a pod in, it’s probably because the receptacle is full. If it’s jammed, you may need to use a bit of force to pull the receptacle out. This happens when the used pods overflow and block the front panel from opening."

      "content": "Turn the handle on the front of the machine up to open the machine. Grab the round metallic handle that loops around the front of the Magimix. Gently pull this handle up above the machine to access the slot where you put the pod in. When you pull this handle up, the front of the machine will extend out automatically. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Drop a Nespresso pod sideways into the opening at the top. Grab the pod that you’re going to brew and hold it sideways so that the plastic top is facing the front of the machine. Drop it sideways into the pod-shaped opening at the top of the machine. This pod can get stuck if it doesn’t fall evenly, so check to make sure the pod is laying flat on its side before closing the machine. [4] X Research source You can adjust the pod with your finger or a kitchen utensil if it isn’t laying perfectly in the slot. You can only put Nespresso pods in your Magimix. If you use some other kind of pod, it can jam inside the slot and damage your machine."

If you do, you may damage the mechanism connecting the handle to the compartment."

To turn it on, press either of the buttons with cups on them. These buttons are located on top of the machine towards the back. They’re the only buttons on the machine, so they shouldn’t be too hard to find. When you press either button, they should both light up and begin blinking green. [7] X Research source On some Magimix models, these buttons are on the side of the machine near the handle towards the front. If the buttons don’t light up, check to make sure that the machine is plugged in. If the buttons blink red, you need to reset the machine."

If you’re making an espresso or want a smaller, stronger cup of coffee, press the lungo button with the small cup on it. If you want a standard cup of coffee, press the button with the larger cup on it. [8] X Research source The button with the large cup on it will produce roughly 3.75 fluid ounces (111 mL) of coffee. The lungo button will pour about 1.35 fluid ounces (40 mL) of coffee or espresso. The button with the smaller cup on it is called the lungo button. Lungo is the Italian word for long, and it refers to a small cup of espresso that uses twice as much water than a standard espresso."

      "content": "Leave the cup on the platform for 5-10 seconds to catch drips. Once the coffee or espresso is done pouring, leave the cup on the platform for a few seconds. Coffee machines tend to drip a little bit when they’re done brewing. You may end up with a few drops on your support platform if you remove the cup immediately. [10] X Research source When picking your cup up, always grip it by the handle. The coffee in your cup is extremely hot and you may burn your hand. Reopen the cup slot when you’re done if you want to empty the pod and air the inside out. This isn’t mandatory, though."

Twist and lift it out of the machine and open the lid. Pour any water inside down the drain and give it a quick rinse to remove any residue inside. If the water tank is especially funky, you can fill it with white vinegar and let it soak for 5-10 minutes before pouring it out and rinsing it thoroughly. [11] X Research source Unpurified water has minerals in it that can cling to the sides of the tank. Cleaning your water tank regularly will ensure that your coffee remains tasty and undiluted."

Then, fill the remainder of the tank with a Nespresso descaling solution. You can use a white vinegar if you prefer. Hold down the 2 buttons on the top of the machine for 3 seconds to set it to descaling mode. Put a large cup under the spout and press the lungo button to run the cleaning solution through the machine. [12] X Research source Do this 2-3 times to completely descale your Nespresso machine. Run a brewing cycle with clean water 2-3 times after descaling it to remove any cleaning solution stuck in your water lines."
