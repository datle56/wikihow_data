      "content": "Find the important functions. There are several functions on the calculator that will be essential for Algebra, Trigonometry, Geometry, Calculus, and more. Find the following functions on your calculator: Basic Operations [1] X Research source Operation Function + Addition - Subtraction (not negative) x Multiplication (There is often an x key for variables as well) ÷ Division ^ Raise to the power of y x y to the power of x √ or Sqrt Square root e x Exponential sin Sine function sin -1 Inverse sine function cos Cosine function cos -1 Inverse cosine function tan Tangent function tan -1 Inverse tangent function ln Log to the base of e log Log base 10 (-) or neg Denotes negative number () Parentheses for denoting order of operations π Inserts pi Mode Switches between degrees and radians"

      "content": "Familiarize yourself with secondary functions. While the bulk of the most common functions will have their own keys (e.g., the SIN key), things like inverse functions (e.g., SIN-1) or less-common functions (e.g., the square root √) will be listed above other keys. [2] X Research source Some calculators have a \"Shift\" key instead of a \"2ND\" key. In many cases, the color of the \"Shift\" or \"2ND\" key will match the color of the function's text."

    {
      "title": "Always close your parentheses.",
      "content": "Always close your parentheses. Whenever you type a left parenthesis, you must close it with a right one; similarly, if you type a total of five left parentheses, you'll have to close them with five right ones. This is important when entering larger calculations, as leaving out a parenthesis can cause the equation to return a far different answer than you should have."
    },
    {
      "title": "Switch between degrees and radians with the MODE key.",
      "content": "Switch between degrees and radians with the MODE key. You can change between displaying values in terms of degrees (fractions of 360) or radians (decimals using pi as the basis) by pressing the MODE key, using the arrow keys to select RADIANS or DEGREES , and pressing the ENTER button. [3] X Research source This is important when performing Trigonometry calculations. If you notice that your equations are returning decimal values instead of degrees (or vice versa), you'll need to change this setting."

      "title": "Learn how to save and restore.",
      "content": "Learn how to save and restore. Saving your results and pulling them back later is an essential skill for dealing with longer problems. There are a couple of different ways to use stored information: After completing a calculation, the last answer is automatically stored. You can perform another calculation on that answer by tying in the next operation. For example, if you just entered 2^4 and pressed ENTER (which equals 16), typing in -10 and pressing ENTER would subtract 10 from the solution (meaning it would be 16 - 10). Use the Answer function to recall the last displayed answer to an equation. When you press the Ans key, the last answer from the previous calculation will be added into your equation. Press STO after retrieving your preferred answer, press ALPHA , select a letter, and press ENTER . You can then use that letter as a placeholder for the answer you stored. Some scientific calculators allow you to retrieve previous answers by pressing the up arrow button. When you find the answer you were looking for, press ENTER to place that number in your current equation. Note that there’s usually a limit to how many previous answers are stored, so you can only use this method for recent calculations."

You can also press the 2ND or Shift key and then press whichever button has \"QUIT\" listed over it (in most cases, this is the MODE key)."

      "title": "Try a simple square root.",
      "content": "Try a simple square root. Test out the button order on an easy and quick problem. For example, you might try taking the square root of 9; you should already know that the answer will be 3, so this is a great tip to use in the middle of a test if you forget which order you're supposed to be pressing buttons: [4] X Research source Find the square root (√) symbol. Either press the square root key or press the SHIFT or 2ND button and then press its key. Press 9 Press ENTER or = to solve the equation."

      "content": "Take the power of a number. In most cases, you'll do this by entering the first number, pressing the carrot ( ^ ) button, and entering the number to which you want to raise the first number. [5] X Research source For example, to calculate 2 2 , you would type in 2^2 and then press ENTER or = . To ensure the number order is correct, try performing a simple test, such as 2 3 . If you get 8 as the answer, then you did it in the right order. If you got 9 , then you actually did 3 2 ."

    {
      "title": "Practice the trigonometry functions.",
      "content": "Practice the trigonometry functions. When you are using the SIN, COS, or TAN functions, you will have to keep in mind two different things: the order of the button presses, and radians versus degrees. These scientific calculator functions are commonly used in Algebra . Perform a simple SIN function with an easy to remember answer. For example, the sine of 30° is 0.5. On a scientific calculator, to find the sine of 30° for example, you type in 30 , then press SIN to get 0.5. If you got a different answer, it probably means that your scientific calculator is not in degree mode. To put it in degree mode, look for a button that says DRG which stands for Degrees, Radians, and Gradients. If you push the DRG button several times, you will see that the mode in your view screen will change between degrees, radians, and gradients. Push the DRG button until you see degrees or DEG indicated in the view screen. Once you have degrees in the view screen, then type in 30 then press SIN and you should get 0.5."

      "title": "Practice entering longer equations.",
      "content": "Practice entering longer equations. Things can get a bit more complicated when you start entering longer equations into your calculator. You will need to take order into consideration, and will often make use of the () keys. Try entering the following equation into your calculator: 3^4/(3+(25/3+4*(-(1^2)))) Note how many parentheses are necessary to keep the formula intact. Proper parentheses use is essential to successfully using the calculator. Most calculators follow PEMDAS (parenthesis, exponent, multiplication, division, addition, subtraction), but using parentheses is the most sure way to correctly calculate the equation. After you’re done calculating for the day, you can try downloading games onto your calculator ."

While things like SIN, square roots, inverse exponents, and pi are often either represented by keys or secondary text above keys, you can find more advanced functions (e.g., factorials) in the MATH menu. To use the MATH menu, do the following: Press the MATH button. Use the up and down arrows to scroll up and down through a category of equations. Use the right and left arrows to scroll right and left through the different categories. Press ENTER or = to select an equation, then enter the number or formula to which you want to apply the equation. Press ENTER or = to calculate the whole equation."
