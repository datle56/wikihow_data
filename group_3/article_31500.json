      "content": "“Ohio Rizz” refers to weird or cringey flirting behavior. “Rizz” is shorthand for charisma. It refers specifically to the kind of charisma you need to flirt with someone effectively and appear attractive. “Ohio,” on the other hand, means something is weird or cringey. Put them together and “Ohio Rizz” means that someone has terrible game. [1] X Research source Nathan tried to ask me on a date last night but he’s got that Ohio Rizz. Poor guy asked me if I wanted to go to McDonalds for a dinner date. Ohio Rizz might refer to someone who has ridiculous pickup lines, someone who just doesn’t do well when dating, or someone who tends to put their foot in their mouth when they talk to someone they like. According to Influencer and Content Creator Aaron Makelky, \"The Ohio term is synonymous with craziness or something being rundown, and people use it to compare bad or negative things. It actually used to be 'Detroit' instead of Ohio, but after a series of Minecraft memes, it morphed into Ohio.\""

      "content": "“Ohio Skibidi Rizz” also refers to weird flirting behavior. “Ohio” means cringey or weird and “Rizz” refers to your flirting game, so what does “Skibidi” add to the phrase? Well, it actually doesn't have a set meaning. Depending on how it’s normally used, skibidi can mean cool, evil, weird, strange, or inconsequential. When it’s added to a phrase like “Ohio Rizz,” it’s sort of just a filler word that makes the absurdist phrase sound even sillier. [2] X Research source Where does “Skibidi” come from? Skibidi is a reference to the YouTube series Skibidi Toilet . Gen. Alpha grew up with this very silly web series about bad guys named “Skibidi Toilets”—floating heads sticking out of toilets that try to infect others with the toilet disease. Yeah, we don’t really get it either. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "It’s kind of a joke that comes from memes in the early 2020s. It comes from people sharing memes on the internet where the image would display something ridiculous and bad (like a kangaroo stealing your Amazon package) and it’d have a caption like, “Can’t have nice things in Ohio” or “Don’t go to Ohio.” The memes sort of have an absurdist, David Lynch-esque energy to them, and there’s nothing Gen Alpha likes more than goofy insanity. [4] X Research source Most kids who use the Ohio slang term don’t actually think Ohio is bad. It’s sort of a running joke. Don’t take it personally, Ohioans!
