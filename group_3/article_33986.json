[2] X Research source It is against the law in most states for an employer to try to keep you from serving on a jury. You also cannot be disciplined for attending jury service. [3] X Research source Be prepared to show your employer a copy of your summons."

      "title": "Dress appropriately.",
      "content": "Dress appropriately. As a juror, you do not have to dress up in a suit. However, you shouldn’t show up to court in your pajamas, either.

      "title": "Go into the courtroom.",
      "content": "Go into the courtroom. In the United States, you will undergo a process called “voir dire.” Jurors will be sent to a courtroom where the defendant and the attorneys are already waiting. The judge will then call up panels of 12-14 jurors to sit in the jury box and be asked questions by the judge and the attorneys. In England, things may happen differently. Instead of being asked questions, you will simply be selected by the clerk and told which courtroom to report to. [10] X Research source You should bring a book to read, as you may not be selected for the first trial. Nevertheless, you have to wait around because you might be selected later."

      "title": "Answer questions.",
      "content": "Answer questions. At random, the judge will call up a panel of jurors to sit in the jury box to be asked questions. The judge will ask you if you can be fair and impartial to both parties. The lawyers may also have questions. [11] X Research source It is hard to know in advance what lawyers will ask, but you should always answer honestly. The questions should not be too personal. The judge will also look at the answers to your questionnaire and ask follow-up questions. For example, if you have been the victim of a crime, then the judge might ask if you harbor bad feelings toward all criminal defendants. Speak loudly when answering the questions. A court reporter will be taking down the questions and answers. You can try to get out of jury service by telling the judge that you cannot serve, but at this point, it will be difficult. If you need to postpone your jury service, you should have requested postponement before the day of your jury duty."

      "title": "Listen to the trial.",
      "content": "Listen to the trial. Based on your answers during “voir dire,” the attorneys will decide whether or not to strike you. If both sides allow you to remain, then you will be part of the jury unless the judge thinks you cannot be fair. The trial may start immediately after the entire jury is selected, or you may have a brief break. Before the attorneys begin their opening statements, you will raise your right hand and take an oath to promise to impartially weigh the evidence. [12] X Research source"

Typically, you will be prohibited from talking about the case and from doing any independent research. [13] X Research source You should follow the judge’s directions. If you fail to follow the directions, then you might be kicked off the jury and be replaced by an alternate."
