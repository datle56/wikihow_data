Each player should line up their stacks in front of them in a horizontal line. [1] X Research source Each player except for the dealer should have an even number of stacks.

[11] X Research source For example, you could form a set of 7s, where you have 1 green, 1 red, and 1 black 7. But you can't make a set of 2 blacks 7s and 1 green 7. A run would be a blue 1, 2, and 3.
