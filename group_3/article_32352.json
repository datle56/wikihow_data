      "content": "Position your car’s bumper with the first line of the parking space. When you approach the parking spot, keep your vehicle as far to the opposite side as you’re able to go so you have more room to turn. Stop your vehicle as soon as your bumper lines up with the edge of the parking space. [1] X Research source Want another way to tell if you’re in the right position? When you look out your window, your shoulder should line up with the line on the parking spot before the one you’re pulling into. If there aren’t any lines marking the spaces in the lot, then make sure there’s about 8 feet (2.4 m) of space between the vehicles before you pull in. If you’re turning into a space on your right, try to stay in the middle of the lane and be careful of oncoming traffic."

      "content": "Lift off of the brakes and gradually turn your steering wheel. Put on your turn signal to let other drivers know you’re about to pull into the space. Slowly lift your foot off the brake pedal to start inching forward. At the same time, start turning the wheel hand over hand in the direction that you want to turn. [2] X Research source Aim the front of your vehicle towards the middle or far side of the space so you have room to straighten out. [3] X Research source Make sure there aren't any shopping carts, debris, or other objects in the parking as you pull in. How hard you have to turn the wheel depends on your vehicle. Newer vehicles can usually make tighter turns than older ones."

      "title": "Pull into the space slowly.",
      "content": "Pull into the space slowly. Keep your steering wheel turned so your vehicle straightens out within the lines of the parking space. Make sure your vehicle is entirely within the parking space and doesn’t overhang. [4] X Research source Check if your side mirrors align with the vehicles next to you to see if you’ve pulled in far enough. If there’s a parking space in front of you, make sure your vehicle doesn’t extend into it. Reverse your vehicle slightly to reposition it."

Once the sides of your vehicle are parallel with the lines of the parking space, turn your steering wheel back to its original position and park your car . Check that your vehicle is evenly spaced between the lines and that you have enough room to open your doors. [5] X Research source If you’re too close to the line on one side, slowly back straight out of the parking spot and pull back in. Turn your wheel slightly to straighten your vehicle out in the middle of the spot. When you back out of the space, put on your turn signal and slowly reverse your vehicle. When you’re halfway out of the space, turn your steering wheel in the direction you want the back of your vehicle to go. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Line up your front bumper with the first line of the parking space. Try to stay about 5–6 feet (1.5–1.8 m) away from the ends of the spaces when you’re parking in an angled spot . Once your front bumper lines up with the edge of the parking space, press on your brakes to stop. [7] X Research source Try to find a parking spot away from other vehicles if you want to practice parking without the risk of hitting anyone. Check the parking spot for any abandoned carts or trash that block your way."

      "content": "Turn the wheel in the direction of the parking space and pull forward. Spin the wheel about half of a turn and lift off of the brakes to slowly pull forward. Keep the wheel turned so your vehicle angles into the space without crossing over the lines.

As soon as half of your vehicle is pulled in, crank your steering wheel back to the original position to straighten out your tires. Keep pulling in until your vehicle is completely within the parking spot. [10] X Research source You want to make sure your wheels are straight so you can back out of your spot straight. Make sure your vehicle doesn’t overhang the front, back, or sides of the spot to avoid getting a parking ticket."

      "content": "Look for a space where your vehicle fits. Drive up next to the space to see if there’s enough room for you to fit between the vehicles. Make sure the space is about 4–5 feet (1.2–1.5 m) longer than your vehicle so you have room to maneuver in and out of the space. [11] X Research source Lots with parallel parking spaces are usually marked clearly with white lines, so it’s easier to know if there’s enough room than if you were parking on the street. If this is your first time parallel parking , look for even larger spaces between vehicles so you have more room."

When your front wheels line up with the back bumper of the vehicle in front of the space, stop your car. [15] X Research source Make sure you maintain the distance between the side of your car and the car in front of you so you avoid scraping it."

As you do this, straighten your car in the space. Leave a few feet of space in front of and behind your vehicle. When you’re finished, just shift into park. Check your passenger side mirror to make sure you’re within 1 foot (30 cm) of the curb when you are done parking."
