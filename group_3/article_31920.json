      "content": "The tattoo isn't scabbing or the scabs don't fall off. Over-moisturizing your tattoo prevents oxygen from reaching it, which can delay the healing process. During normal healing, your tattoo will start to form scabs that flake off over the next few weeks. If you notice that your tattoo isn’t healing (scabs aren’t forming, or the scabs aren’t flaking off even after several weeks), it could be a sign you’re over-moisturizing. If scabs are forming, don't be alarmed! This is a completely normal part of healing. Don’t scratch, pick, or peel the scabs—let them flake off naturally. If you aren’t sure if your tattoo is healing normally, reach out to your tattoo artist. They can let you know if things are looking okay!"
