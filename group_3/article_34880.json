      "content": "Get undressed from head to toe. Bikinis are meant to bare a lot of skin, so go ahead and get undressed. Remove your bra and underwear, too. Don't attempt to wear your bikini over underwear, since it will be nearly impossible to keep your underwear from peeking out when you're active at the beach or pool."

      "title": "Pull on the bikini bottoms.",
      "content": "Pull on the bikini bottoms. Bikini bottoms usually provide the same amount of coverage as bikini-style underwear. The top edge of the bikini bottoms should sit along your hips, crossing over each hip bone below your belly button. In the back, they should hug your bottom tightly. Depending on the style you're wearing, they'll provide either full or partial cheek coverage. [1] X Research source Your bikini bottoms should not sag or droop. If they feel loose, you need a smaller size. They also shouldn't cut into your skin and cause bulging. If they do, try a size up."

      "title": "Fasten the bikini top below your breasts.",
      "content": "Fasten the bikini top below your breasts. Put on the top as you would put on a bra, fastening the band around your chest first. It might help to put the top on backward so you can fasten the band in the front, then slide it around to position it correctly with the cups in the front. If it's a string bikini, first tie a tight knot, then tie the ends in a bow. Tie it so that the bikini will stay in place, but not so tight that it cuts off your circulation. If the band of your bikini top is loose enough to easily slip your hand through, either tie it tighter or go down a size. If it's so tight that you feel uncomfortable, go up a size."

      "title": "Adjust the cups.",
      "content": "Adjust the cups. Rest your breasts right in the center of each cup, to keep them securely in place there. Make sure the fabric of the cups completely covers your breasts; if they feel tight, or your breasts and bulging out from the sides, you might want to go up a size. If they feel loose, try a size lower or choose a padded top. Here are the different types of bikini tops, and how to fasten them properly: Triangle top: This style provides the least amount of support and coverage, and it works best for smaller breasts. Make sure your breasts are positioned in the centers of the triangles. If your top has sliding triangles, slide them over your breasts to make sure the fabric covers your breasts entirely. Halter top: This style provides a more support, making it a good choice for bigger breasts. Position your breasts in the center of each cup, and stretch the cups around your breasts for maximum coverage. Bandeau top: This style is strapless, so make sure you choose the right size so that your top won't slide up or down. Adjust the top so that your breasts fit into the center of the cups. It should hug your chest quite firmly; if it sags or droops, you may need to go down a size or choose a different style top. Underwire top: This style is similar to a bra, and fits much the same way. Position the underwires so that they sit right beneath your breasts, then lower your breasts into the cups."

      "title": "Adjust the straps.",
      "content": "Adjust the straps. It's important to adjust the straps so that they keep your bikini top secure and provide support for your breasts. You want the straps to be tight enough to hold your bikini top in place, but not so tight that they dig into your shoulders. Your bikini top should feel as comfortable as a bra. Adjust bra-style bikini straps just as you would regular bra straps. Use the plastic slides on the straps to loosen or tighten them. If the straps are strings you need to tie, it might take a few tries before you're able to tie the knots just right. They should be tight enough to provide support for your breasts, but not so tight they cut into your shoulders. Tie the ends of the strings into bows. Some bikini tops are styled as halters, with two strings that are tied right at the nape of your neck. Again, make sure you tie the strings tight enough to support your breasts without being uncomfortable. If you find that you aren't able to adjust the straps in a way that allows your breasts to be well-supported without causing pain in your shoulders or neck, you may need a different style top. Try a traditional bra-style top with an underwire for maximum support."

      "content": "Take a walk around the room to check for slipping and discomfort. Try skipping and jumping, too. You're going to be having fun in the sun, and you don't want to have to worry about your breasts coming loose or your bikini bottoms slipping down. Make adjustments where necessary so you can wear your bikini confidently all day long."

      "title": "Consider removing hair around your bikini line.",
      "content": "Consider removing hair around your bikini line. It might help you feel more confident to know that no hairs will poke out from your bikini bottoms as you're laying out in the sun or swimming in your bikini. Trimming and shaving is a popular way to do it, since it's inexpensive and not painful. You can also consider waxing the area if you plan ahead. To figure out what hair to remove, put on your bikini bottoms and check out the hair that pokes out around the edges. You want to remove enough hair so that your bottoms adequately cover everything that's left. Choose to shave your legs and underarms if desired. Removing hair from these areas can make you feel more bikini ready."

      "title": "Exfoliate your skin.",
      "content": "Exfoliate your skin. Since wearing a bikini involves showing off your skin, you might want to baby it a little a day or two before it's time to hit the beach or pool. In the bath or shower, use a loofah or exfoliating scrub to exfoliate your arms, legs and everything in between. This will get rid of dry skin and give you a healthy glow. Use gentle circular motions to exfoliate your skin, rather than scrubbing too hard. Don't forget your back and other hard to reach areas. Use a scrub brush to get to the places you can't easily reach."

      "title": "Use a rich moisturizer.",
      "content": "Use a rich moisturizer. After exfoliating, apply your favorite moisturizing lotion to protect your skin from drying out. Your skin will be soft and gleaming when it's time to put on your bikini. As an alternative to moisturizer, try coconut or olive oil to soften your skin."

      "title": "Don't forget your sunscreen.",
      "content": "Don't forget your sunscreen. Wearing a bikini means using a lot of sunscreen, since most of your body will be exposed to the sun's rays. Apply sunscreen with SPF 16 or higher five to ten minutes before going out into the sun, and reapply as necessary throughout the day. Wearing plenty of sunscreen will prevent you from ending up with a painful burn and provide protection against sun spots and skin cancer. Try waterproof sunscreen if you're going to be swimming. You'll still need to reapply it more than once throughout the day. If you're trying to get a tan, you should still wear sunscreen. Sunscreen prevents you from getting burned, but it doesn't completely stop the sun from affecting your skin. It's much better to get a gradual tan than to get burned first."

      "content": "Take along a coverup. You may not feel like being exposed to the sun and other elements the entire time you're at the beach or pool. Bring along a cute coverup you can throw over your bikini whenever you want. As a bonus, it will protect your skin from the sun, so you won't have to worry about slathering your entire body in sunscreen when you wear it."
