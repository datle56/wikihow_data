      "content": "Purchase a wooden shadowbox frame at least 1 inch (2.5 cm) in depth. A shadowbox is an enclosed glass front picture frame that is wide enough to hold and display items. You can purchase one at most craft stores, and you can choose any size that you prefer for your space. Make sure the frame you choose should is at least 1 inch (2.5 cm) in depth in order to accommodate the LED lights you will use later.

You will use it to insert the LED lights between the glass panel and the mirror."

      "content": "Disassemble the shadowbox and remove the glass. Once you have the shadowbox frame you’re going to use, turn it around so it’s face down. You will see some small metal tabs around the perimeter. Move each one up and out of the way so you can remove the wooden backing of the frame. Then, remove the glass and set it aside.

      "content": "Obtain a sheet of silver 80% reflective film and cut it to fit the glass. For this project, you’ll need a sheet of silver reflective film to make the glass slightly reflective and to get the full effect of the illusion. Place the glass on top of the film, trace the outline with a marker, then cut on the line with a pair of scissors. [3] X Research source The purpose of the film over the glass is to create a two-way mirror that is transparent on one side and reflective on the other. Glass is not reflective, so you need to put a reflective film over it so that it is just slightly transparent. When the LED lights bounce back and forth between the two-way mirror and the regular mirror, you get the fascinating infinity effect. You can find the reflective film at any craft store or online. You can also use car window tint film from an auto parts store."

Turn it over and clean the other side as well. When you’re finished, check that there is no dust or streaks on the glass. Complete your cleaning on a large flat surface, and rub gently to avoid breaking the glass. [4] X Research source"

As you peel, wet the film with soapy water from a spray bottle. This will help to prevent the film from sticking to itself as you unpeel it. [5] X Research source"

Make sure the tinted side of the glass is facing upwards so it faces the mirror at the back of the frame when you put it in. [7] X Research source"

Jot down the dimensions and cut the LED lights to fit. Then, unpeel the backing of the lights and stick it inside the edges of the inner frame where you just measured. [10] X Trustworthy Source Science Buddies Expert-sourced database of science projects, explanations, and educational material Go to source There are a variety of LED lights you can choose from. They can be one color, white, or multi-color. The LED strip will have black lines that indicate where you can cut it. Make sure you only cut the lights where it is indicated on the strip. If you don’t, the lights may not work when you turn them on. If you have a few extra LEDs that don’t fit inside the frame, you can wrap them around the edge of the mirror and stick them to the back.

Find a spot in the bottom corner of the frame and use a saw to make a gap wide enough to fit the wire. This will allow the wire to fit nicely and the frame will sit evenly on the wall. To use the saw, hold it with your dominant hand and use your other hand to hold the frame steady. Then, slowly move it back and forth until you create a gap at least 5 centimetres (2.0 in) wide. [13] X Research source Be careful when using the saw. Move it slowly so you do not cut through the frame."

Replace those tabs that you moved previously to disassemble the shadow box by folding them down over the back of the mirror. When you hang your shadowbox up, the contents will stay in place. Then turn on the LED lights and enjoy your infinity mirror! [14] X Research source"
