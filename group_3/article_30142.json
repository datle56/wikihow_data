      "title": "Purchase slats or cut 12 wood boards to create your slats.",
      "content": "Purchase slats or cut 12 wood boards to create your slats. Each slat must have a thickness of 3 ⁄ 4 in (1.9 cm) and a width of 2 1 ⁄ 2 in (6.4 cm). You can either purchase pre-fabricated slats from a construction supply store, or cut a larger chunk of wood into individual pieces. To cut them, pull out a measuring tape and use a carpentry pencil to mark the lengths off with hash marks. Use a straight edge to add the cutting lines. Turn on your table saw and trim each slat to be 12 in (30 cm) in length. [2] X Research source The dimensions listed in this article will make a bucket with 12 slats that is 12 inches (30 cm) tall and 11 3 ⁄ 8 inches (29 cm) wide. You can adjust the dimensions as you’d like, but it’s best if you don’t adjust the number of slats. Using an alternative number of slats requires readjusting the angles for gaps between slats, which can be hard to calculate. You’re going to nail a template into the slats to space them out while you construct the bucket. It will be much harder to remove this template if you use a hardwood, like oak or walnut. Instead, opt for a softwood, like pine or cedar."

      "content": "Buy or cut 2 templates for the slats using strips of wood that are 40 in (100 cm) long. You can purchase these strips or cut them to size with a table saw. The 2 template pieces are going to be stapled into the slats to help space out the gaps between the slats. If you're cutting the templates yourself, use a table saw to cut 2 templates that are each 40 inches (100 cm) long and 1–2 inches (2.5–5.1 cm) wide. [3] X Research source Since these templates will be easier to attach if they’re thin, stick with wood strips that are roughly 1⁄2 in (1.3 cm) thick or smaller."

      "content": "Mark 1 in (2.5 cm) from the top and bottom of each slat. Use a measuring tape to measure off 1 in (2.5 cm) from the top edge of each slat and make a horizontal hash mark. Repeat this process from the bottom edge of each slat. [4] X Research source You are going to install the template along these hash marks to hold the slats in place while you install the copper ring that goes around the bucket and holds the slats together. Then, you will remove the template before attaching the slats to the base of the bucket."

      "content": "Line your slats up in a single row next to one another. Set each of your slats down on a flat work surface with the wider side flat. Use a spirit level to line the slats up along the top. Push each of the slats together so that it looks like you have a single rectangular chunk of wood. [5] X Research source Double-check your hash marks to make sure that they’re parallel along the top and bottom of the slats. If they aren’t, now is the perfect time to redraw them."

      "content": "Create 3 ⁄ 8 in (0.95 cm) of space between each slat with spacers. Brace the top and right side of the rectangular set of slats with spirit levels or a spare board. Then, spread each slat out to create gaps between each slat using prefabricated 3 ⁄ 8 in (0.95 cm) spacers. Slide a spacer in between each set of slats at the top and the bottom, 1–2 inches (2.5–5.1 cm) from the hash marks, closer to the center. [6] X Research source You can make spacers yourself by cutting a scrap piece of wood into 20 blocks that are 3 ⁄ 8 in (0.95 cm) each. The gaps must be 3 ⁄ 8 in (0.95 cm) if you’re using the 3 ⁄ 4 by 2 1 ⁄ 2 in (1.9 by 6.4 cm) boards. If you are using different slats, divide the thickness of a single slat by 2 to determine how big the gaps must be."

Line the board up so that the bottom edge of the template rests along the line made by the hash marks. Grab a set of thin nails and a hammer. Gently nail the template into each slat. Repeat this process on the bottom set of hash marks you made. [7] X Research source The nails should be no longer than 1 ⁄ 2 in (1.3 cm) in length. The smaller, the better! You have to remove this template after attaching the straps, and the template will be hard to remove if you use long nails. Recheck each gap between the slats before nailing the template into place to make sure the spacers haven’t moved."

Set your first copper strip underneath the template at the top. Then, drive a nail through the strip over each slat that it covers. Use the template on the opposite side of the slats as your guide to line the strip up straight. [9] X Research source You don’t need to worry about the slats moving around while you’re hammering the nails in. The template will hold the slats in place."

Line the edge of the copper strip up with the template on the other side so that the bottom edge of the copper strip matches the top of the template. Nail this strap into the slats so that both strips are parallel. [10] X Research source There should be a little bit of extra space left over on each copper strip if they are at least 40 inches (100 cm) in length. It doesn’t matter if the extra copper is symmetrical on both sides, or if there’s a little extra copper hanging off of only one end."

Carefully pull up the first template by ripping it out of the slats. Use a chisel to get in between the template and the slats if necessary. Use channel locks or pliers to remove any nails that don’t come out. Repeat this process on the second template. [11] X Research source The thin nail holes won’t readily be visible since they’re sitting on the side that will be the inside of the bucket."

Carefully outline the interior base of the bucket on the plywood. Aim to mark exactly at the point where the plywood meets the slats to avoid leaving a large gap in your base. Draw along each slat before removing the body of the bucket and setting it aside. [13] X Research source You don’t need to use plywood if you don’t want to, but it’s a good option for the bottom of the bucket since it’s inexpensive and easy to cut."

Set the plywood on saw horses and use a jigsaw to cut one edge to size. Then, use hand clamps to secure the side you cut to a saw table. Trim each additional side of your outline off with your jigsaw. [14] X Research source Wear protective eyewear, a dust mask, and gloves when operating your jigsaw. You’re doing this by hand without any guidelines, so be careful when making each cut. You can use a table saw or miter saw and trim each edge perfectly, but this is really time consuming and the base doesn’t need to be perfect to sit at the bottom of the bucket."

Place the plywood base you cut on top of the bucket and rotate it along the slats at the top until it slides down into the bucket. The staples or screws will catch the base and hold it at the bottom.

Drill pilot holes that match the width of the rod on opposite sides of the bucket. Bend the metal rod to shape by hand or with pliers and slide each end into the pilot holes. [17] X Research source For a more secure handle, fill the pilot holes with wood glue before sliding the metal rod into the holes."
