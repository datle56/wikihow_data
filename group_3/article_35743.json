      "title": "The defrost drain is clogged.",
      "content": "The defrost drain is clogged. This drain collects water from melted ice after the fridge defrosts. The water flows down the drain hole, which directs the moisture down to the drain pan at the bottom of the fridge. When the drain is clogged with ice, the water overflows the collection trough and leaks inside the freezer. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "The condensation hole in the refrigerator is blocked.",
      "content": "The condensation hole in the refrigerator is blocked. It’s supposed to drain the naturally forming condensation in your fridge into the drain pan. So if you see water collecting near it and you notice a layer of moisture on the inside walls and shelves, the drain may be clogged with food or other debris. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "The ice dispenser or ice tray is broken or too warm. A cracked ice dispenser or one that’s been turned off accidentally and gotten too warm may leak water into the freezer and cause ice to form on the inside of the door. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "The refrigerator isn’t tilted properly.",
      "content": "The refrigerator isn’t tilted properly. The front feet of your refrigerator should sit 1 ⁄ 4 to 1 ⁄ 2 inch (0.64 to 1.27 cm) higher than the back feet. This allows the coolant to circulate, the door to shut on its own, and the water in the defrost drain to flow downward more efficiently. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "The refrigerator isn’t level on the floor.",
      "content": "The refrigerator isn’t level on the floor. When your refrigerator doesn't sit flush against the floor because of uneven feet or flooring, water may not flow as efficiently through the defrost drain line. If the water can’t drain, it will form a puddle and leak water and ice into the freezer portion of your fridge. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Unclog the defrost drain using warm water and a turkey baster.",
      "content": "Unclog the defrost drain using warm water and a turkey baster. Unplug the refrigerator and take all the items and shelves out of the freezer. Unscrew and unplug the ice dispenser (if there is one) and the back panel covering the drain hole. Then fill a turkey baster with warm water and squeeze it into the drain hole. [7] X Research source Keep squeezing warm water into the drain hole until the line unclogs. You’ll know it’s clear when the puddle of water surrounding the drain hole flows away. Clean all the ice out of the freezer, replace all the parts you removed, and plug the refrigerator back in. If a clogged defrost drain was causing your leak, you should be in the clear! If you have a Whirlpool fridge, unplug the fridge, pull it away from the wall, and unscrew the left side of the back plate. Reach in and pull the plastic boot off the end of the defrost drain line, clean the gunk out of it with warm water, and replace it. Repeat this process every few months. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Unclog the condensation drain if the condensation persists. Unplug your fridge, remove the crisper drawers, and locate the condensation drain hole at the back of the fridge. Use a turkey baster to squeeze warm water down the condensation hole until you notice that water no longer pools around the hole. [9] X Research source Clean the water up with a towel, replace the crisper drawers and food items, and plug your refrigerator back in. Ensure the thermostat is set to the optimal temperature of 40 °F (4 °C) and that your door fully seals."

      "title": "Inspect the door seal for damage if you still notice condensation.",
      "content": "Inspect the door seal for damage if you still notice condensation. If the seal on the door is damaged, that means it’s not working properly and is letting warm air in, which is the root cause of the humidity. [10] X Research source Appliance technician Aaron Beth recommends purchasing a new seal directly from your refrigerator model’s manufacturer. You can’t repair it, he says, because it’s made out of vinyl with magnets inside, and you can’t mend a tear or a split in that type of material."

      "title": "Check that the ice dispenser is turned on and seated correctly.",
      "content": "Check that the ice dispenser is turned on and seated correctly. Then check that neither the ice tray nor the ice dispenser have any holes or cracks. If they do, replace them with parts that are compatible with your fridge. [11] X Research source If you still notice a leak, ensure the freezer is at the USDA-recommended temperature of 0 °F (−18 °C). If your freezer isn’t cold enough, the ice won’t be able to freeze and may leak out or cause condensation."

      "content": "Adjust the feet to fix the tilt and level out the refrigerator. Most modern refrigerators come with self-leveling feet, but some older models may require manual adjustments. [12] X Research source To adjust the refrigerator feet yourself, gain access to the front feet by removing the front grille and to the back feet by pulling the fridge away from the wall. Use a crescent wrench to raise or lower each foot until the front of the fridge sits 1 ⁄ 4 to 1 ⁄ 2 inch (0.64 to 1.27 cm) higher above the floor than the back. Use a tape measure or yardstick to check your measurements. Place a spirit level on top of the fridge parallel to the door or doors to ensure the feet are adjusted correctly and the fridge is balanced. If the floor is extremely uneven, Beth suggests placing a thin piece of plywood underneath the feet to make them level."
