      "title": "Choose your rolling paper.",
      "content": "Choose your rolling paper. Use thin rice or wheat-straw paper in a standard or king size. Plan to tear your paper down to size—wide and square is a solid, versatile starting shape. Buy papers online, in convenience stores, at marijuana dispensaries, and at tobacco shops. Look for papers that burn slowly and evenly. Look for papers that contain few chemical additives, as some chemicals burn with a bad flavor. Consider brands like RAW natural hemp rolling papers and Zig-Zag. If you plan to carry your papers around with you, get a rolling paper protector. Put your rolling papers into this metal case to prevent them from bending and tearing. Improvise a case from an empty mint or gum tin. Carry spare paper. Gummed strips torn from a spare paper are great for mending tears, leaks, and gaps."

      "title": "Buy loose leaf tobacco.",
      "content": "Buy loose leaf tobacco. You can visit a local tobacconist for a wide range of options, or you can find a bag of basic rolling tobacco in many liquor stores and grocery stores. Look for tobacco that contains few chemical additives. You can buy plain tobacco or flavored tobacco, depending on your taste. Consider common, generally affordable brands like Bali Shag and American Spirit. Consider rolling clove cigarettes . All you need to do is mix shredded cloves with your tobacco. Clove cigarettes usually contain a ratio of 60-70 percent tobacco to 30-40 percent clove. Some people like to roll their cigarettes with pipe tobacco. Feel free to do this, but keep in mind that pipe tobacco is usually longer and wetter than cigarette-rolling tobacco. Thus, it may pack too densely, and it may not burn as well in a cigarette. If you want to use pipe tobacco, try to cut it more finely and dry it out before rolling. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Shape the tobacco.",
      "content": "Shape the tobacco. Spread the tobacco out evenly on the rolling surface, then use a card or your fingers to form the pile into the shape of a cigarette. Choose a smooth and well-lit rolling surface: a mirror, a book, or a clean table. If you don't want to put the tobacco directly onto a surface, cover it with a clean sheet of white paper. It helps if the color of the surface contrasts with your tobacco so that the tobacco doesn't blend in. Rolling tobacco on a thick brown carpet, for instance, could quickly become a nightmare. Make sure that the tobacco is not too compact. Tear it apart lightly, so it still forms one connected unit."

      "title": "Rest one end of your rolling paper between your thumb and middle finger.",
      "content": "Rest one end of your rolling paper between your thumb and middle finger. Hold the paper in the crease with your index finger of the same hand. Use the other hand to adjust the paper into a creased, open chute. Hold it steady so you don't spill any tobacco. The index finger in the crease serves to stabilize the paper as you add tobacco, and it will also keep tobacco from spilling out the end. This end will become the tip of the cigarette—the part that you light."

      "title": "Fill the crease with tobacco.",
      "content": "Fill the crease with tobacco. Use your free hand to pinch the tobacco and sprinkle it along the crease in the paper. Work from one end to the other, starting with the end that you are holding. Transfer the rest of the pile from the rolling surface to the paper. You can roll your cigarette thicker or thinner to taste. The main considerations are whether you can seal the cigarette and how well it pulls. The thicker the cigarette, the harder it will be to close; the more densely you pack the tobacco, the harder it will be to draw the smoke through the cigarette. [2] X Research source If needed, even out the tobacco along the paper to make it consistent. Getting it as level as possible helps the cigarette burn more smoothly. If it is damp or clumped, gently pick apart any lumps with your fingers. You may wish to leave some hanging over the ends: you can pinch it off later, and it will keep the ends from being too narrow."

      "title": "Insert the filter or leave a space for it.",
      "content": "Insert the filter or leave a space for it. If you plan to use a filter, either insert it now or leave a tobacco-less space to slip it in later. Make the space exactly as long as the filter. You have several filter options: Buy a bag of fresh cellulose cigarette filters. You can find these online, at smoke shops, and at certain marijuana dispensaries. These are essentially the same filters that you'd find on a store-bought cigarette. [3] X Research source Remove the filter from a store-bought cigarette. If you have store-bought filter cigarettes around, and you don't want to smoke them—or if you just want to practice rolling—you can carefully tear the paper and remove the filter. Lay this filter into your rolled cigarette. Make your own rough filter. First, tear a thin strip of sturdy paper from an index card or business card. Fold it three times to make a pleat, and roll the rest of the unfolded filter around the folded. It should look like a \"W\" encircled. Make sure that that the folded filter will fit smoothly into the cigarette; you may need to adjust it several times. Keep in mind that this homemade filter will only block the largest particulate matter from entering your lungs."

      "title": "Hold both ends of the paper.",
      "content": "Hold both ends of the paper. When the cigarette is full of tobacco, it is ready to roll. Keep holding the paper in the same hand, but grasp the other end in the same way—between your middle finger and thumb. Lift your stabilizing index finger from the paper; you no longer need its support. The paper should rest between the thumb and middle finger of both hands. The tobacco should be evenly spread, except at the very tip where your index finger was."

      "title": "Wrap your middle fingers along the back side of the paper for extra support.",
      "content": "Wrap your middle fingers along the back side of the paper for extra support. Your fingers should form a fairly straight line from one end of the cigarette to the other. Use your thumbs to hold the unrolled cigarette slightly below the underside of your middle fingers. [4] X Research source The contour of the fingers should suggest the shape of the cigarette."

      "title": "Begin to roll the cigarette.",
      "content": "Begin to roll the cigarette. Roll the cigarette between your thumbs and middle fingers. [5] X Research source Shape the cigarette: compress the tobacco and try to roll the paper tightly. While you do this, gradually apply pressure towards the ends of the cigarette. Try to keep your thumbs and middle fingers parallel."

      "title": "Roll the cigarette.",
      "content": "Roll the cigarette. First, tuck the edge of the paper into the tobacco crease. Apply more pressure with your thumbs, and roll your middle fingers upward. Complete the first rotation: wrap the paper all the way around the tobacco, in the shape of a cigarette, without creasing the bottom of the paper. [6] X Research source The front edge of the paper should tuck snugly behind the tobacco as you begin to roll. This may take a few tries. Just keep moving the front of the paper up and down, and gently push in with the thumbs until it catches."

      "title": "Lick and seal the cigarette.",
      "content": "Lick and seal the cigarette. Roll the cigarette until only the adhesive end of the paper remains. Activate the adhesive by licking all the way along the edge of the paper; think of it like sealing an envelope. [7] X Research source When the adhesive is wet, roll the rest of the paper until no edge remains. Seal the cigarette by applying even pressure: run your fingers along the length of the cigarette, and gently but firmly press the adhesive until it sticks. Make sure not to bend, tear, or crinkle the paper."

      "content": "Pinch off any tobacco sticking out of the ends. This will make your cigarette neater, better-looking, and easier to smoke. If loose strands of tobacco are hanging from the ends of your cigarette, they may wind up in your mouth or fall onto the floor. [8] X Research source"

      "title": "Twist the tips to completely seal cigarette.",
      "content": "Twist the tips to completely seal cigarette. Some smokers prefer to lightly twist one or both ends of their cigarettes. Twisting the tip that you light will prevent the tobacco from falling out of a poorly-packed cigarette. Twisting the tip from which you smoke will keep tobacco from sticking to your lips. A filter will do the trick as well. If you like to twist the tips, consider leaving a bit of space at the ends of each cigarette that you roll."

      "content": "Insert the filter if you haven't already. If you left space for a filter, insert it into the end and tuck the paper around it slightly. If you didn't leave enough space for the filter, use a small, sharp tool—tweezers, a hook, or the tine of a fork—to pull out enough tobacco that the filter fits."

      "content": "Pack the machine. First, open the machine: part the two rolling cylinders to reveal a cavity in the shape of a cigarette. Then, pack the cavity with tobacco – as tightly as you like. When the space is full, close the cylinders. One cylinder should move in and out, and one should remain in place. Hold the machine so that the movable cylinder is closest to you. Be sure to add a filter now if you want one. Tuck the filter snugly into one end of the rolling compartment. Remember that the more tightly you pack the cigarette, the more difficult it will be to draw smoke. This especially the case with machine-rolling."
