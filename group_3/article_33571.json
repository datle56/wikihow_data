      "title": "Buy some Pocky.",
      "content": "Buy some Pocky. Pocky are sweet Japanese cookies that come in many flavors. You can find them at your local Asian market or in the international aisle at a grocery store. Milk chocolate is the most popular flavor, but you can also find Pocky in other flavors too, such as matcha (green tea), strawberry, and cookies 'n cream. [2] X Research source If you can’t find Pocky, any long, thin biscuit, such as a breadstick, will do."

      "title": "Choose a partner that you wouldn't mind kissing.",
      "content": "Choose a partner that you wouldn't mind kissing. If you’re playing the game with a group of people, the rules of the game are the same. You can have two couples play at once. Then, the winners of both games can face off in their own Pocky game. The Pocky game often results in a kiss, so it makes sense to pick a partner you wouldn’t mind kissing to begin with. You can use this as an opportunity to break the ice with your crush or bring you closer to a good friend."
    },
    {
      "title": "Propose the game at a party.",
      "content": "Propose the game at a party. The Pocky game is meant to be a fun (and sexy!) party game. Bring Pocky to a party, and then simply propose play. You might say, “Has anyone played the Pocky game before?” You’ll either be met with enthusiasm or curiosity. Either way, you’ll have a captive audience to teach the rules. You can also play the game at other occasions too, such as sleepovers ."
    },
    {
      "title": "Brush your teeth and check for good breath.",
      "content": "Brush your teeth and check for good breath. Because you’ll be getting close to the other players, it’s considerate to brush your teeth so that you have good breath for the Pocky game. [3] X Research source If you don’t have access to a toothbrush at the party, chewing a stick of mint gum for a little bit would do. Spit the gum out before you begin to play so that it doesn't get stuck on the Pocky. Make sure that you are in good health. Don't play this game if you are sick. Brushing alone won't get rid of those germs."
    },
    {
      "title": "Face the person you’ve selected as your partner for the Pocky game.",
      "content": "Face the person you’ve selected as your partner for the Pocky game. You’ll both need to have the same posture, so both sitting or both standing. Get close enough so that your faces are within about 12 inches (30 cm) of each other. Make sure that you are both comfortable. If standing is too awkward, take a seat instead."
    },
    {
      "title": "Place a Pocky stick between you.",
      "content": "Place a Pocky stick between you. Each take opposite ends of the Pocky stick between your teeth, so the Pocky is creating a line between your two mouths. Try not to snap the Pocky yet. One player then does a countdown backwards from three to begin play. Only one side of the Pocky stick is covered with chocolate. The other side isn't. It doesn't matter who has the chocolate side. If you are playing this in a group, consider having someone else start the countdown."
    },
    {
      "title": "Bite your end until reaching the middle.",
      "content": "Bite your end until reaching the middle. Both players bite their end of the Pocky stick, moving towards the middle. Try not to drop the Pocky as you chew in this process. The goal is to reach the middle. [4] X Research source If you drop the Pocky stick, then grab another. If this is in a group, then you could both \"lose\" and be out of the game."
    },
    {
      "title": "Don’t pull away.",
      "content": "Don’t pull away. Both players’ mouths will meet in the middle of the Pocky stick, but the first to pull away is the loser. It can be kind of funny to be so close to someone, so try not to giggle and lose your bit of the Pocky stick. Often, neither party will turn away, resulting in the kiss. In that case, everyone wins!"
