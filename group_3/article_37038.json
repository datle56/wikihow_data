      "content": "Cut along the caulking between the wall and the trim. Look for a bead of caulking securing the trim to the wall. Slide a utility knife down the full length of the trim to loosen it. [2] X Research source This can also help remove paint that’s adhering the trim to the wall."

    {
      "title": "Pry the old trim away from the wall.",
      "content": "Pry the old trim away from the wall. Insert a pry bar underneath the old trim. Firmly pry it from the wall by applying downward pressure—toward the wall—to lever it toward you and off the wall. Begin with the top piece, then move onto the sides. Continue to pry away the trim until it's all removed. [3] X Research source Put a shim between the wall and pry bar to avoid damaging the wall. If your trim is in really good shape, you can reuse it! Otherwise, measure the pieces so you can purchase replacements."

      "title": "Remove the door jamb.",
      "content": "Remove the door jamb. Use a handsaw to cut through the door jamb. You only need to make a single cut and can do so at any point along the jamb. Then use a pry bar to pry loose the existing jamb from both the sides and the top of the door casing. [4] X Research source Cutting the jamb helps you to remove it more easily since it provides a point of access to insert the pry bar. Measure the opening so you can select a door that will fit without having to add a bunch of shims. Doors come in standard sizes, so this shouldn’t be too difficult."

      "title": "Take out any nails that remain in the wall.",
      "content": "Take out any nails that remain in the wall. After removing your frame, you might notice some nails still stuck in the wall. Use pliers or the sharp end of the hammer to apply pressure toward the wall and lever them out. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Position the new door and frame in the opening and tack it in place.",
      "content": "Position the new door and frame in the opening and tack it in place. Select a pre-hung door with the same dimensions as your old door. Carefully set it in the opening and use a level to ensure the hinge side is plumb. Adjust the door as necessary, then nail it into place on the hinge side first with galvanized casing nails. [6] X Research source Read the instructions that come with your new door to see if there are any manufacturer-specific steps you need to follow."

    {
      "title": "Shim the openings to ensure the door is plumb.",
      "content": "Shim the openings to ensure the door is plumb. Begin on the hinge side and place shims into the opening between the frame and wall. Place shims at the top of the door next, then on the latch side. Check to make sure the door is level and plumb, then use a utility knife to score the shims so they’re even with the wall. Break off the excess and discard it. [7] X Research source Position the shims evenly for best results. Put them at the top, middle, and bottom on each side of the door."

      "title": "Insulate the gap between the frame and wall.",
      "content": "Insulate the gap between the frame and wall. Spray foam insulation in the spaces between the frame and the wall. Use minimal expanding foam insulation for the cleanest results. Allow the foam to expand and dry before moving on. [8] X Research source Check the instructions on the foam packaging to determine how long it will take to dry."

      "title": "Replace the trim",
      "content": "Replace the trim . If your old trim was in good shape, you can simply replace it. Otherwise, purchase pre-painted trim from the hardware store and cut it to size with a circular saw. Use a miter saw to cut 45-degree angles into the corners of each piece so they line up evenly to frame the door. Nail the trim into place with finish nails. [9] X Research source Use a level to ensure each piece of trim is plumb. Put on goggles and earplugs before using a saw. To cover the nail holes in the trim, spread a thin layer of painter’s putty over them with your finger. Be sure to choose putty that matches the color of your trim."

      "content": "Caulk around the edges of the trim. Use a caulk gun to apply an even bead of caulk around the perimeter of the trim. Wet your finger and use it to smooth out the bead. Wipe your finger on a damp cloth as many times as you need to in order to ensure a smooth, even bead of caulk around each piece of trim. [10] X Research source"

      "content": "Install the doorknob . Purchase a kit with a strike plate and doorknob in a style you like. Open the packaging and take out the pieces. Push the latch into the hole so that the flat side of the latch bolt faces the inside of the room and screw it into place. Attach the latch plate with the provided screws. Put the part of the doorknob with the square peg in first, then align the other side of the doorknob and push it into place. [11] X Research source Screw the knobs into place, then line the latch bolt up with the strike plate on the jamb and screw the strike plate into place. If you’re working on an exterior door, there will be a place for a deadbolt as well. Simply repeat the process to put the bolt inside the opening and screw the deadbolt cylinders in place so the keyhole is on the outside."
