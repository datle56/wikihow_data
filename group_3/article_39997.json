      "content": "Hide your cell phone somewhere. Fully charge your phone, shut down or switch to silent mode, then put it in a place where your parents won't spot it. If your cell phone is kept by your parents, better get it after they go to bed. Make sure to remember the exact place from where you took your phone — returning it to a different place will attract your parents' suspicion. When going outside of your room, avoid squeaky floors."
