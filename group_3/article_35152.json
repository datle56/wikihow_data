      "title": "Knot Symbols",
      "content": "Knot Symbols There are 4 basic knots used to make friendship bracelets, each represented by a circular symbol on your pattern. The arrow shows the direction and type of knot you’ll make. The color of the circle shows which string you’ll be knotting with, and the colored line under it represents the string you’ll be knotting over. [3] X Research source The knot symbols are as follows: Forward Knot: Right arrow Backward Knot: Left arrow Forward-Backward Knot: Arrow to the right and back Backward-Forward Knot: Arrow to the left and back Not all strings will have a knot symbol on each row. This just means that you’ll skip knotting that string."

      "title": "Forward Knot",
      "content": "Forward Knot A forward knot moves a left string to the right while making a knot of the left string’s color. To make this knot, hold the right-handed string taunt. Then, create a 4 shape over the right string with the left string. Thread the left string through the 4 ’s loop and pull upwards. Repeat the 4 shape, thread, and pull, and you’ve created a forward knot. [5] X Research source"

Then, create a backward 4 over the top of the left string with the right string. Bring the right string through the 4 ’s loop and pull the knot upwards. Repeat this motion to make a backward knot. [6] X Research source A backward knot is just like it sounds—a “backward” version of a forward knot!"

      "title": "Forward-Backward Knot",
      "content": "Forward-Backward Knot A forward-backward knot is half of a forward knot and a backward knot. To make this knot, make a 4 over a right string with a left string and pull the string through the loop. With the same string, create a backward 4 , thread the end of the string through the loop, and pull. [7] X Research source"

      "title": "Backward-Forward Knot",

Create this knot by making a backward 4 with a right-handed string over a left-handed string and pulling the string through the loop. Then, create a regular 4 with the same string, and thread it through. [8] X Research source Think of it like half of a backward knot and half of a forward knot."

      "title": "Arrange your strings as they appear in the pattern.",
      "content": "Arrange your strings as they appear in the pattern. Measure your string and cut it to your desired length. Then, tie the strings together with a simple overhand knot or create a loop (this only works if you have an even number of strings). Tape or clip the knot to your work surface, and position your strings in the order they appear in the pattern. [9] X Research source For example, say you have an ABBAABBA chevron pattern that’s purple and yellow; you want 6 strings with 3 being purple and 3 yellow. Then, position them as follows: purple, yellow, yellow, purple, purple, yellow, yellow, purple. Most friendship bracelets require strings at least 36 in (91 cm) long. If your strings are a bit tangled, no worries! Tug on them under the knot until they lay in the correct position. A friendship bracelet loom can help you order and keep track of your strings, especially if you’re a beginner."

The number of pairs depends on the pattern, so keep knotting from left to right until there’s nothing left to knot in row 1. Just remember to make the knot with the color string represented in the knot symbol. [12] X Research source For our example, you’d make a backward knot with the third yellow over the third purple and a backward knot with the fourth yellow over the fourth purple."

[13] X Research source Pair the remaining strings with their new partners, and knot from left to right until you reach the end of the pattern like you did for row 1. [14] X Research source With our example, you’d put the first and last yellow strings aside and group the left purples, middle yellows, and right purples into pairs. The lines or strings that intersect under a knot symbol are a pair."

Once you’ve reached the end of the pattern, check to make sure your strings’ order matches the pattern. [15] X Research source If your strings match, great! You can move on to the next step. If your strings don’t match, don’t panic! Compare your knots to the pattern’s knot symbols. If one of your knots isn’t the same colors as the pattern’s, undo the row(s) with a safety pin and try again."
