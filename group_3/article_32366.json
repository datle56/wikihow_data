From the Mad Hatter’s tea party to the Queen of Hearts’ croquet field, there are tons of iconic scenes you can use as decor inspo for this party theme. It’s a great theme for a child’s birthday party, but it’s also fun for grown-up get-togethers (especially if you serve Alice in Wonderland-themed cocktails!).

Food: Tea party-inspired finger foods and beverages served in teacups are great options.
