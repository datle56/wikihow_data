      "title": "Wash the affected area with soap and water.",
      "content": "Wash the affected area with soap and water. Pour a tablespoon (14.8 mL) of dish soap into a basin filled with 2 cups (475 mL) of warm water. Soak the glued skin into the water and leave it for at least 5 minutes. Pour out the basin, refill it with fresh water and soap, and repeat the process at least once more. This should help loosen the glue so you can wipe it off. [1] X Research source Gorilla Glue recommends using soap and water to remove all of their glues, including regular glues, superglue, epoxies, craft glues, and even construction adhesives. If the glue is still wet, it may be possible to remove most, if not all, of it with a dry cloth or towel."

      "title": "Apply an acetone-based nail polish remover.",
      "content": "Apply an acetone-based nail polish remover. Dip a cotton swab or cotton ball into a bit of nail polish remover. If the affected area is larger, consider pouring the acetone into a bowl instead. Soak the glued skin for 6 to 10 minutes. Then, remove it from the solution and wash it off with warm, soapy water. [2] X Research source Make sure to get a nail polish remover with 100% acetone, as that is the active ingredient that will eat away at the glue. Remember, acetone can strip away the oils in your skin and on your nails, so be sure to moisturize after using this method. Mendes adds that “Acetone (fingernail polish [remover]) is good on many surfaces, except plastic, painted surfaces, and wood.” Another option is to use hydrogen peroxide, as Mendes says it “is good for removing the glue from your skin.”"

      "content": "Exfoliate with a pumice stone. Grasp your pumice stone firmly in one hand and rub it back and forth across the glued skin. Apply just enough pressure so that you can feel the drag of the glue, but not enough to tear or rip your skin. Repeat for a few minutes until the glue begins to separate from your skin. [3] X Research source To minimize any damage to your skin, change directions with each pass of the pumice stone. You can also try to use rough exfoliating gloves to work the glue loose."

      "title": "Work citrus juice into the glue.",
      "content": "Work citrus juice into the glue. Place a few drops of citrus juice directly onto your glued skin. Or, cut a lemon or lime in half and hold it against the skin. Keep the citrus juice or lemon/lime on your skin for five minutes. The citric acid will start to eat away at the glue, making it more likely to fall away. [4] X Research source Be cautious using this method if you have any cuts or sores on your skin, as the citrus can cause some irritation."

      "title": "Rub the area with sugar or salt.",
      "content": "Rub the area with sugar or salt. In a small bowl, mix together a spoonful of sugar, a spoonful of salt, and just enough water to moisten them both. Apply this mixture onto the glued skin area and rub it in with your fingers. Wipe off and replace the solution as it gets broken down. The rough salt and sugar crystals should wear away at the glue.

      "title": "Rub warm oil onto your skin.",
      "content": "Rub warm oil onto your skin. Place a small bowl of sunflower oil , coconut oil, baby oil, or olive oil in the microwave and heat it for 10 to 20 seconds. The final temperature should be warm, but not hot enough to burn. Use a cotton swab to apply the oil directly onto the glued skin area. Let it soak for 3-4 minutes, then check to see if the glue has dissolved . If not, repeat the entire process over again. [6] X Research source Some people also claim that lip gloss or cooking spray, non-heated, can help to loosen super glue."

      "title": "Wait for it to fall off naturally.",
      "content": "Wait for it to fall off naturally. Skin naturally regrows and regenerates. If the glued spot isn’t too large or painful, you can simply wait for it to flake away on its own after about 5 or 6 days. Make sure to watch for any cracking or breaking of the skin around the glued spot. This is also a good option if you are worried about applying corrosive chemicals to your skin.

      "title": "Apply moisturizer after removing the glue.",
      "content": "Apply moisturizer after removing the glue. Glue provides a barrier that prevents moisture from reaching your skin. Combine this with any chemicals that you apply to break it down and you might notice that your skin seems abnormally dry or flaky. Counteract this by rubbing in a bit of body lotion or baby oil onto your skin. [8] X Research source"

      "title": "Never pull the skin apart immediately.",
      "content": "Never pull the skin apart immediately. Resist the natural urge to pull or yank the skin away from what it’s connected to. Gorilla Glue is a very strong adhesive and can actually damage your skin before breaking away. If the glue is on a large portion of your skin or if you are in pain, seek medical attention right away instead. [9] X Research source"

      "title": "Soak plastic surfaces with a wet, soapy cloth.",
      "content": "Soak plastic surfaces with a wet, soapy cloth. Harsh solvents like acetone and alcohol often eat through plastic surfaces, so it’s often harder to remove glue from plastic products. Soak a cotton cloth in warm water and dish soap, then lay the cloth on top of the glued area for 2-4 hours. Drip more soapy water onto the cloth as needed to keep it moist. Remove the cloth and wipe up the glue if it has dissolved. If it hasn’t, gently scrape it with a putty knife. [10] X Research source Another option is to use nitromethane, which can often be found in specialty hobby stores. Follow the instructions on the package to apply it correctly. Remember, there are many types of plastic, and each will react differently. Mendes says the best solvent for removing Gorilla Glue “depends on the surface because you don’t want your solvent to cause any damage. You should perform a small test with your solvent in an inconspicuous area to be sure [that it’s safe].”"

      "title": "Scrub clothes or fabric with acetone and a toothbrush.",
      "content": "Scrub clothes or fabric with acetone and a toothbrush. Apply a bit of acetone or soap and water onto the fabric. Then, get an old toothbrush and rub it over the glued on area. Try to alternate directions while rubbing and experiment with a light jabbing motion against the fabric to flake the glue away. [11] X Research source Rubbing alcohol also works well with cotton and polyester. Check the fabric of your clothing first to see if alcohol or acetone are safe to use. If you’re not sure, test the product on an inconspicuous area first."

      "title": "Wash the clothes in the washing machine.",
      "content": "Wash the clothes in the washing machine. After you’ve removed as much glue as you can from the surface of the fabric, place it in the washing machine by itself on a cool setting. Follow the instructions on the fabric’s label to avoid damaging it. [12] X Research source It’s best if you wait until the Gorilla Glue is fully dry before completing this step. This will prevent the glued parts from sticking to other areas of the fabric."

      "title": "Apply vinegar or WD-40 to leather.",
      "content": "Apply vinegar or WD-40 to leather. Products like acetone and rubbing alcohol are typically too harsh for leather, so rubbing the surface with vinegar is often a gentler option. Alternatively, spray some WD-40 to loosen the glue and make it easier to remove. WD-40 can also soften leather . [13] X Research source"

      "title": "Apply isopropyl alcohol to metal or non-plastic surfaces.",
      "content": "Apply isopropyl alcohol to metal or non-plastic surfaces. Dampen a cotton ball or folded paper towel with isopropyl alcohol and place it against the glued-on area. Let the alcohol sit on the surface for about 5 minutes. Remove it and wipe the area down with warm, soapy water. The glue should be loosened enough to scrape away with the edge of a putty knife. [14] X Research source Mendes warns against using isopropyl alcohol if the surface is painted, however, as she says, “It can break down paints.”"

      "title": "Scrape the glue off with a blunt tool.",
      "content": "Scrape the glue off with a blunt tool. If the Gorilla Glue is stuck to a hard surface, get a putty knife or other tool and apply pressure to the side of the glued area. Gently scrape the glue to lift up its edges. If the glue stays put, add a bit of acetone to the area with a cotton ball and try again. [15] X Research source This can also work for other hard surfaces like glass, plastic, or wood . Just make sure the tool you use doesn’t scratch or damage the surface."

      "title": "Blot glass with rubbing alcohol, acetone, or lighter fluid.",
      "content": "Blot glass with rubbing alcohol, acetone, or lighter fluid. Glass is typically a durable surface, so it can withstand stronger solvents than surfaces like plastic. Apply the solvent of your choice to a cotton ball, cloth, or sponge. Blot and rub the glue in circular motions, applying strong pressure as needed. If the glue doesn’t come off right away, let the solvent sit for several minutes, then try again. [16] X Research source"

      "title": "Follow the package directions.",
      "content": "Follow the package directions. Before starting your project, carefully read the instructions on the Gorilla Glue package. Pay attention to how you are supposed to hold the applicator and how much glue you are supposed to apply at a time. If you have any questions, reach out to Gorilla Glue Customer Service at 1-800-966-3458. [17] X Research source For example, to move the glue down into the nozzle, hold the bottle upside down and tap the cap on a hard surface a few times."

      "title": "Wear gloves.",
      "content": "Wear gloves. Wearing gloves while working on a project is the best way to prevent super glue from getting on your skin. Try out different types of work gloves at the hardware store to find the best type and fit for you. The downside is that you’ll have to be careful not to get any glue on the gloves themselves. [18] X Research source Disposable gloves are a great option when working with glue. However, make sure that they fit properly."

      "title": "Cover your workspace.",
      "content": "Cover your workspace. Remove extra items from your work area and cover the entire space with either foil or a plastic sheet. The benefit of foil is that the glue will not stick to it after it’s hardened. Either way, using a cover will protect the surface underneath, such as a countertop, and prevent it from being damaged.

      "title": "Choose the right applicator for your project.",
      "content": "Choose the right applicator for your project. One of the biggest mistakes that you can make is attempting to complete a project with a too-small or too-large super glue applicator. There are many different types of Gorilla Glue available, from pens to gel tubes, so spend some time researching exactly what you should use. [20] X Research source It’s also important to remember that even the largest projects generally only require a very small amount of super glue."
