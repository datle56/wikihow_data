The rectangle contains an open hand in white that’s surrounded by a semi-circle of seven white stars. [1] X Research source Symbolism: The red rectangle is made to resemble the banner of the medieval Kingdom of Abkhazia, while the open hand within it represents a welcome greeting to friends and a halting warning to enemies. The seven stars may represent the seven historical regions of the country: Sadzen, Bzyp, Gumaa, Abzhywa, Samurzaqan, Dal-Tsabal, and Pskhuy-Aibga. There are also seven total stripes, which correspond to the Abkhaz’ sacred number 7. The green and white colors may also represent the tolerance and coexistence between Christianity and Islam. Adoption: Abkhazia’s flag was officially adopted on July 23rd, 1992, when the Declaration of Independence of Abkhazia was also officially written."

      "content": "Algeria The Algerian flag is split vertically down the middle, with the left side being entirely green and the right side being entirely white. In the center, there’s a red crescent surrounding a five-pointed star. [2] X Research source Symbolism: The green on the flag is said to represent agriculture as well as Islam, which is the dominant religion in Algeria. The red crescent and star are also traditional symbols of Islam. The white color, meanwhile, is thought to symbolize purity and peace. The red shade may also symbolize the blood that was spilled in order to secure Algeria’s independence from France. Adoption: This flag was adopted in Algeria on July 3rd, 1962, after a similar design was used by the exiled Algerian government from 1958 to 1962.

      "content": "Basque Country The Basque flag features a red field with a green saltire and white cross laid over it. In layman’s terms, the flag—which is also known as the Ikurriña—has a red background with a white + shape and a green X shape. Both shapes intersect in the flag’s center and continue out to the edges of the banner. [4] X Research source Symbolism: The red field of the Basque flag represents Biscay, which is a province of the Basque Country that the flag initially represented before being more widely adopted. The green saltire represents the Oak of Gernika, a symbol of Basque independence, and the white cross represents the Basque people’s Catholicism and devotion to God. Adoption: The Ikurriña was designed by Sabino Arana in 1894 as the Biscay flag, but the Basque National Party adopted it as the flag of the entire Basque Country in 1933. The flag was used as the Basque Auxiliary Navy’s Naval jack during the Spanish Civil War, although it was banned by the dictatorial Franco regime after the Basque government’s defeat in 1938. However, it was still used in the French Basque provinces and by ETA, a Basque separatist group."

      "content": "Belarus Belarus’ flag is split horizontally into red and green—the top two-thirds of the flag is red, while the bottom one-third section is green. An ornamental pattern in red and white runs down the left side of the flag. [5] X Research source Symbolism: The flag’s red stripe symbolizes sacrifice and freedom in the fight for Belarusian independence, while the green one represents life and growth. The ornamental pattern is derived from Belarusian folk embroidery, paying homage to the country’s rich cultural history and customs. Adoption: Belarus has adopted other flags before the modern one. Their first flag was a plain white design, referencing their name (which means “White Russia”). Later on, a white, red, and white flag was used, with the design being inspired by the Grand Duchy of Lithuania’s coat of arms. During the Soviet era, Belarus adopted the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic flag. This flag featured horizontal red stripes (representing communism) and light green stripes (representing the country’s natural fields and forests). There was also a gold hammer and sickle with a red star in the flag’s upper corner. After the communist Soviet government fell, Belarus returned to the white-red-white flag until 1995, when the current flag was adopted."

[11] X Research source Symbolism: The flag’s red stripe symbolizes strength and power, the white one symbolizes faithfulness, loyalty, and purity, and the green one represents the country’s natural landscapes as well as hope and optimism.

The flag was finally adopted as the official national flag in 1957, after which it was reaffirmed in 1990. [12] X Research source"

More specifically, the flag is horizontally divided into equal sections—the top stripe is green, the middle one is white, and the bottom one is red. Within the white stripe (and in the center of the flag), there’s a red “tulip and sword” design which symbolizes the Islamic declaration of faith: La Ilaha Illa Allah (“There is no god but God”). Text also runs along the central edges of the green and white stripes, repeating Allah Akbar (“God is the greatest”) in white script. [13] X Trustworthy Source National Geographic Website of the National Geographic Society Go to source Symbolism: The flag’s green stripe represents the Islamic faith and prosperity, the white stripe represents peace, and the red stripe represents bravery and martyrdom. Before 1979, Iran’s flag had the same tricolor of stripes, but the emblem depicted a lion and a sun together. This “Lion and Sun” design was popular in Persia as a symbol of power and royalty.

The leftmost stripe is green, the middle one is white, and the rightmost one is red. [14] X Research source Symbolism: The green is thought to represent Italy’s green landscapes, while the white is thought to represent the snowy Alps mountain range. Red, on the other hand, likely symbolizes the blood spilled during Italy’s multiple wars of independence. The colors of the Italian flag are also derived from Milan’s coat of arms, which is red and white, and the uniforms of the Milanese civic guard, which are green. Some claim that the flag’s tricolor design was inspired by the French flag, which Napoleon introduced to Italy. However, this historical inspiration has never been confirmed. [15] X Research source Adoption: The modern flag was adopted as the official flag of Italy in 1946."

[16] X Research source Symbolism: The red stripe symbolizes martyrdom and the fight for freedom, the white stripe symbolizes peace and equality, and the green stripe symbolizes the beautiful natural landscapes of Kurdistan and the life and vitality they bring. The sun symbol at the center of the flag is derived from an ancient symbol of the sun, representing light and the source of all life.

Newroz, or the Kurdish New Year, is celebrated on this date, and the number 21 is religiously significant and sacred in Yazdani customs. Adoption: In general, the flag is touted as a symbol of Kurdish identity and their fight for independence, freedom, dignity, and self-determination. The flag was first presented at the Paris Peace Conference in 1920, and it was first flown over the Republic of Mahabad’s government institutions in 1945."

The red stripe represents the sacrifice and blood shed by Mexico’s national heroes, as well as the unity between different groups within the nation.

Adoption: The current flag was officially adopted on November 24th, 1992, after Tajikistan secured its independence from the Soviet Union. The prior Soviet Tajik Republic flag had a similar design, but it lacked the crown and stars, which were added to represent unity between different nationalities and social classes."
