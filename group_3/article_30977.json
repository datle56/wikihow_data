      "title": "Check your local laws before you use diazinon.",
      "content": "Check your local laws before you use diazinon. Before you mix diazinon, you should make sure it’s legal to use in your area. Diazinon is illegal for residential use in many places. Contact your local government or go online to see if diazinon is banned where you live. If you’re not sure, don’t use it or you could risk a high fine. [1] X Research source Diazinon is highly toxic to wildlife and the environment if it isn’t disposed of properly."

      "title": "Clear the area of any people or pets.",
      "content": "Clear the area of any people or pets. Diazinon is a highly toxic pesticide that can damage the nervous system of any animal or person that is exposed to it. Before you begin mixing your diazinon, you need to make sure that the area is clear of people and animals that could be exposed to it. [2] X Research source Diazinon can also contaminate personal items like toys and tools, so remove them from the area as well."

    {
      "title": "Work in a well-ventilated area.",
      "content": "Work in a well-ventilated area. Diazinon can give off fumes that are noxious and dangerous in high concentrations. It’s important that you work in an area that’s well-ventilated to avoid exposure to the neurotoxin. If it’s possible, mix the diazinon outside. [3] X Research source If there is a breeze or a fan in the area you’re working, make sure the fumes aren’t being blown towards people. The toxic fumes can build up and remain in a room, so don’t mix diazinon indoors."

      "title": "Dress in long sleeves and long pants to cover your skin.",
      "content": "Dress in long sleeves and long pants to cover your skin. Diazinon can also enter your body by getting on your skin and entering your bloodstream. Wear a thick long sleeve shirt, long pants, closed-toe shoes, and socks when you’re mixing diazinon to keep it from getting on your skin. [4] X Trustworthy Source National Pesticide Information Center Organization run by Oregon State University providing objective, science-based information about pests and pesticides Go to source Button up your long sleeve shirt all the way to reduce the amount of exposed skin. Blue jeans are good long pants to wear to prevent exposure. Consider wearing a chemical-resistant apron to prevent getting any of the chemical on your clothes."

    {
      "title": "Wear chemical-resistant gloves when mixing diazinon.",
      "content": "Wear chemical-resistant gloves when mixing diazinon. Your hands are at the most risk of coming into contact with the diazinon while you mix it, so wear thick, chemical-resistant gloves to avoid getting any of the chemical on your skin. Make sure the gloves fit your hand and can be tucked into the sleeve of your shirt so all of your skin is covered. [5] X Trustworthy Source National Pesticide Information Center Organization run by Oregon State University providing objective, science-based information about pests and pesticides Go to source You can find chemical resistant gloves at most large chain stores."

      "title": "Put on eye protection.",
      "content": "Put on eye protection. The neurotoxin in diazinon can cause blindness. Basic safety goggles will help prevent any of the chemical from entering your eyes. Diazinon is sprayed from a tank, so wear eye protection that also protects the sides of your eyes to prevent exposure from a splashback or deflection of the spray. [6] X Research source Safety glasses or goggles can be purchased at large department stores and online."

      "title": "Use a respirator to avoid inhaling the fumes.",
      "content": "Use a respirator to avoid inhaling the fumes. The spray mist of the diazinon is very easy to accidentally breathe in and the neurotoxin can cause serious damage to your nervous system. You need to use a full respirator to avoid the mist or the fumes that the chemical gives off. [7] X Research source Make sure the respirator is fitted to your face well."

      "content": "Keep paper towels and sawdust handy to contain any spills. In the event of a spill, you don’t want to use water to clean it up because it can just spread the diazinon around and could be harmful to the environment. Have paper towels and absorbent material like sawdust or kitty litter nearby to quickly soak up any spills. [8] X Trustworthy Source National Pesticide Information Center Organization run by Oregon State University providing objective, science-based information about pests and pesticides Go to source Keep garbage bags nearby as well to dispose of the cleanup materials."

Fill a clean spray tank with 1 gallon (3.8 L) of water and test the spray mechanism to make sure the tank sprays properly. [9] X Research source Always clean your spray tank out with clean water immediately after using diazinon to prevent contamination."

Diazinon is a versatile pesticide and can be used to treat a variety of plants. It’s important that you add the right amount of diazinon because too little could be ineffective and too much could damage your plants and the environment. Pour the measured amount directly into the water in the spray can. [10] X Research source"

Once you’ve combined the water and diazinon and mixed it up well in the spray tank, use it to treat your lawn, foundation, or plants immediately. The fumes can build up in the spray tank and are toxic, so it’s best to use the pesticide as soon as you can, so you can then clean out the spray tank. [12] X Trustworthy Source National Pesticide Information Center Organization run by Oregon State University providing objective, science-based information about pests and pesticides Go to source Do not store any unused diazinon in the spray tank. Dispose of the diazinon at appropriate disposal sites. If you’re in the US, you can call 1-800-253-2687 to find a disposal location near you. Do not pour the diazinon into a drain or garbage can! It can damage the environment or harm another person who is exposed to it!"
