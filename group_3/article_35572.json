Also known as the Red String of Fate or the Red Thread of Marriage, this East Asian legend states that the ends of an invisible string are tied to two people who are fated to meet and fall in love, like the concept of soulmates. The legend originated from Chinese mythology but is also a part of other East Asian cultures, like Japan and Korea. [1] X Research source The two people connected by the Red Thread of Fate are destined to be lovers, regardless of time, place, and circumstances. The thread may stretch or tangle, but it will never break. The body part the string is tied to varies from myth to myth. In the original Chinese legend, it was tied to both lovers’ ankles, while in the Japanese story, it was tied to the male’s thumb and the female’s little finger. In modern times, most cultures tend to depict the string being tied around both parties’ little fingers."

In the original legend, the lunar matchmaker god, Yuè Lǎo, was in charge of marriages and choosing which people the Red Thread of Fate would connect. He would briefly make the string visible to show someone their connection. The color red was likely chosen because, in China, it represents happiness and is often featured prominently in weddings. [3] X Research source The idea of the string being tied to people’s pinkies likely comes from the discovery of the ulnar artery, which directly connects the pinky to the heart."
