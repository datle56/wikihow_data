      "title": "Consider renting a baritone at first.",
      "content": "Consider renting a baritone at first. Baritones can be quite expensive, ranging from several hundred to several thousand dollars. Start with a rental if you are on a lower budget or not sure about your dedication to the instrument. Lease a baritone if you want to own it eventually. A payment is typically made every two to three months until the instrument is paid off. The instrument will not be yours until the final payment is made, but you will have the baritone while you are making payments."

      "content": "Think about getting a student model. Different models are made for different experience levels. A student level baritone is typically cheaper, more durable, and more simply made than a professional level baritone. Try contacting a music dealer to fit you with a baritone that feels comfortable for you. If you must purchase the instrument online, try to communicate with the seller about your level of experience."

      "content": "Purchase a case. A baritone is easily damaged. It is important to protect your baritone when you are not using it. A good case will have strong handles, sturdy backpack straps, and most importantly, it will provide a snug fit. [1] X Research source A leather case is most often used by musicians because it is light and durable."

      "content": "Finish your practice session with care. Gently remove the mouthpiece and put it in the mouthpiece hole in the case. Return the instrument to its case. The case should be stored with the bell in an upright position. An incorrectly stored case with the bell turned upside down will weaken and damage the instrument over time. [6] X Research source Check and clean the spit valve regularly after a practice session. If a slide doesn't have a spit valve take out the slide and shake out the water. Store the case in a place with a cool or moderate temperature. [7] X Research source Don't put your instrument nearby a heat source like a heating as it can damage it."

      "content": "Learn the parts. You will need to learn the names and locations of the parts on your baritone. Pull up a picture, or use your instrument to identify the parts. The main parts are: The bell. The bell is the large, rounded opening where the sound waves emerge from your instrument. Sometimes the bell is straight, and sometimes it is bent forward. The bell is designed to produce the best tone and volume possible. [8] X Research source The three or four valves. The valves are comprised of three parts: the casings, pistons, and valve slides. The casings are the three cylindrical metal tubes that keep the pistons in place. The pistons move up and down inside the casings as you press on them. The pistons have small holes in them so that the air moves through them to produce different tones as you play. The valve slides change the length of the baritone’s tubing in order to produce different tones. There are usually three valve slides, and the first valve slide is the closest to the mouthpiece. [9] X Research source Water key. The water key allows you to remove moisture from inside the horn. It is a small metal lever that is usually located on the main tuning slide. This part can be used by pressing on the key and blowing into the mouthpiece. [10] X Research source Mouthpiece receiver. This part connects the mouthpiece to the baritone. It is typically a small metal cylinder that is fused to the end of the pipe that connects the baritone and mouthpiece. [11] X Research source Mouthpiece. The mouthpiece is a large, deeply cupped metal part that directs the air and lip vibrations into the baritone. [12] X Research source Main tuning slide. This part of the instrument is used to make micro-tuning adjustments. The water key is located on top of this part. [13] X Research source"

[14] X Research source The notes are in some cases the same as the ones for trombones; it depends on what key you are playing in. The baritone can play of treble clef and bass clef so make sure you know which one you are playing. B flat baritones are normally treble clef and C baritones are normally bass clef."

      "title": "Learn the scales.",
      "content": "Learn the scales. The scales become more complicated as you advance in your practice. To begin with, search for beginner scale exercises. Scales are usually thought of as a series of notes played from and back down again. Practice playing in that order. [15] X Research source Scales are usually played out of order when you become more advanced. Try playing low and high notes together."

Breathing exercises will help you control the pitch you are playing, and allow you to gain stamina. [16] X Research source Take twelve very small breaths of air in. Release the air in the next four counts. Repeat three or four times. Start with your arms by your side. Take six breaths in as you raise your arms next to your head. Breath out six times as you lower your arms. You should be halfway through your six breaths when your arms are out straight at your sides."

Be sure that to be safe in any situation involving meeting with strangers, though. Ask other musicians if they know anyone that needs a baritonist.
