      "content": "Empathetic language can help them feel understood. Someone with clinically diagnosed NPD may believe that no one else can understand what they’re going through. By telling them that you see where they’re coming from, you’re telling them that they’re not all alone in this world. Try this if you think their feelings are justified, even if they are being a little dramatic.

      "content": "A neutral statement can disarm someone who’s emotional. When you’re talking with someone who’s behaving in a narcissistic way, it’s best to avoid making any statements for or against what they’re saying. Instead, say something non-committal that’s just enough to appease them. Hopefully, your lack of a reaction will be enough to get them to move on.
