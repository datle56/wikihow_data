      "title": "Say \"xiè xie.\"",
      "content": "Say \"xiè xie.\" This is the most common way to say \"Thanks\" in Chinese, especially in Mandarin Chinese. [1] X Research source Mandarin Chinese is spoken across most of northern and southwestern China. It has more native speakers than other forms of Chinese. Xie does not translate directly into English, but when spoken as xiè xie, it means \"Thanks\" and \"'xiè xie nǐ\" means \"Thank you.\" A rough pronunciation of xiè xie is syeh-syeh. The first xiè starts high and drops by the end. The second xie is a neutral tone, meaning it is said lightly and without any emphasis. In simplified Chinese characters, xiè xie is 谢谢. In traditional Chinese characters, it would be 謝謝. Other \"thank you\" sayings involving xie xie include \"xiè xiè nín de bāng zhù,\" (谢 谢 您 的 帮 助/謝 謝 您 的 幫 助) a formal way of saying \"thanks for your help,\" and \"xiè xiè nǐ bāng wǒ,\" (谢谢 你 帮 我/謝 謝 你 幫 我) a casual way of saying \"Thanks for your help."

      "title": "Use \"nǎlǐ, nǎlǐ\" when given a compliment.",
      "content": "Use \"nǎlǐ, nǎlǐ\" when given a compliment. [2] X Research source This phrase translates roughly into “where, where!” The Chinese culture values humility, and saying “thank you” in response to a compliment can come off as being a little arrogant. By saying “where, where,” you are essentially deflecting the compliment. Within the U.S. culture, it would be similar to saying “shucks.” A rough pronunciation of this response would be na-ha-lee na-ha-lee. In simplified Chinese characters, this response is written as 哪里哪里. In traditional Chinese characters, it would be 哪裡哪裡."

      "title": "Try \"bù, bù, bù\" for compliments, as well.",
      "content": "Try \"bù, bù, bù\" for compliments, as well. As with nǎlǐ, nǎlǐ , responding with bù, bù, bù is a way to politely deflect compliments. This response is similar to saying \"no, no, no\" in English. The number of times you say \"bù\" can vary depending on how strong your denial needs to be. The greater the compliment, the stronger the denial. A rough pronunciation of bù, bù, bù would be bhoo bhoo bhoo . Write bù in Chinese as 不."

      "title": "Say \"doh zeh/doh je(a common variation of the former)\" for a gift.",
      "content": "Say \"doh zeh/doh je(a common variation of the former)\" for a gift. This is the standard way of saying “thank you” in Cantonese. [3] X Research source Cantonese is spoken mainly within southern China. Outside of mainland China, it is spoken by most people living in Hong Kong and Macau. It is also spoken within many overseas Chinese communities in Southeast Asia, Canada, Brazil, Peru, Cuba, Panama, Australia, New Zealand, Europe, and the United States. Even though this is the most common way of saying “thanks” in Cantonese, it is almost always used in response to thanking for someone for a tangible gift. Thanking someone for a favor requires a different term. In native Chinese characters, spell the response out as 多謝. A rough pronunciation of doh zeh/do jeh is daw-djyeh/daw zeah . If you are thanking someone for a gift in advance, say \"doh je sin” (with a long I sound) instead of “doh je.” It literally means, \"Thank you first\"."

      "title": "Use \"m goi\" for service.",
      "content": "Use \"m goi\" for service. If someone performed a service or favor for you, this would be the correct way of thanking him or her in Cantonese. [4] X Research source This response would not usually be used when thanking someone for a physical gift. It is generally used for services. For instance, you would say “m goi” to a server at a restaurant after he or she refills your glass but not as a response to a birthday present. Using Chinese characters, m goi is written as 唔該. A rough pronunciation of m goi is mm goy. The mm is said in a fairly neutral tone, while the goi or goy rises toward the end. Switch to \"m goi nei sin\" when you are thanking someone for a service before that service is actually performed."

      "content": "Use \"gum xia\" in the Hokkien, Hakka, and Teochew dialects. [5] X Research source This version of \"thank you\" is appropriate in all three dialects. Hokkien Chinese is spoken by many overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia, especially around Taiwan, and within a southern Fujian province in China. Hakka is spoken by certain Han Chinese living in provincial areas like Hunan, Fujian, Sichuan, Guangxi, Jianxi, and Guangdong in China. It is also spoken by Chinese worldwide in Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Taiwan, Thailand, Malaysia, and the United States. Teochow is spoken primarily in the region of Chaozhou, a city in the eastern Guangdong province of China. In native characters, gum xia should be written as 感謝. A rough pronunciation of the phrase would be gahm syeh."
