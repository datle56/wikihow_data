      "content": "Find 2-6 players for your game. Monopoly is designed for fewer than 6 players. Just know, the game can feel unique (or take longer) depending on how many players you have. [1] X Research source 2 player games: both players will be evenly matched, so the game can last a long time. Once someone gets lucky or makes a great move, they usually win the game without a Chance for their opponent to catch up. 3-5 player games: these games tend to be well balanced for fairness and enjoyment. Games tend to last about 2 hours. There's a lot of room for the losing players to stay in the game. 6-8 player games: these take the longest to play, and there’s going to be a lot of time between turns. However, it can feel like you’re at a real disadvantage if you’re one of the last players to go. Monopoly is intended to be played by people aged 8 or over. If a lot of your players are younger, consider playing Monopoly Junior instead! It’s designed for younger kids. You can play Monopoly online if you’d like. Play a public game with strangers, or play a private game with friends ."

The banker can still play the game, but they do need to keep their money separate from the bank’s.

Make sure each player has enough space to keep their money and property deeds in front of them. Place the Chance and Community Chest cards on the board in their marked spaces. [3] X Research source The Chance cards are orange and have a ? on them. The Community Chest cards are blue and have a treasure chest on the back."

The game comes with a large selection, but you can also play with any small object. It does not matter what piece you choose as they all serve the same purpose. Younger players tend to get very excited to choose certain pieces. Let them pick first if you can!"

Players may also exchange money for different bills of the same value once play begins. For example, someone can give a $500 note to the bank in exchange for 5 $100s. [4] X Research source Each player starts with: US Version | UK Version 2 $500s | 2 £500s 4 $100s | 4 £100s 1 $50 | 1 £50 1 $20 | 1 £20 2 $10s | 2 £10s 1 $5 | 1 £5 5 $1s | 5 £1s"

Most of them are properties that you can buy or pay rent on, but some of them require you to draw a card from one of two decks, collect money, or even go to jail. [7] X Research source Note: Nothing happens when you land on “free parking.” If you land naturally on the jail square, put your piece in the “just visiting” lane. Any taxes are paid directly to the bank. If a Chance card says to go to the “nearest” utility or railroad, you are always expected to go forward and not backward - collecting $200 if passing go on the way."

If you are the first one to land on a square with a colored stripe across the top, a railroad, or a utility, you may buy the property for the amount printed on the board. Pay the bank and the banker gives you the title deed for that property. [8] X Research source Most players recommend buying every property you can, since you win by building a real estate empire. You do not have to buy a property if you don’t want to; it may be ideal to skip a property if you’re saving up cash to buy properties or something like that. You cannot buy a property if you do not have enough money to purchase it unless you choose to mortgage other properties in order to do so."

If a player lands on an unowned property but chooses not to buy it, then the property is auctioned and awarded to the highest bidder. This rule is part of the official game but many people omit it at home. [9] X Research source Whenever a player who lands on an unowned property opts not to buy it, the banker takes over and auctions it off immediately. The player who initially declined to buy the property at the printed price can still participate in the auction. Bids can start at any price and keep going until no one wants to increase their bid. In the rare event that absolutely no one wants the property, it returns to the bank and the game resumes."

If you land on someone else's property, you must pay them the rent printed on the title deed card for that property (unless they have mortgaged the property). Rents vary according to the price of the property, whether or not a player has a complete color set (monopoly), and if they’ve built houses or hotels. [10] X Research source If a player cannot afford rent, they can mortgage properties to raise cash by flipping an owned property upside down and taking the amount on the card from the bank. You do not collect rent from mortgaged properties."

This is one of the main goals of the game, since you can bankrupt other players easily if you have a monopoly. Players with a monopoly get to charge double rent for their property on unimproved sites of that color set. [11] X Research source The reason rent is so high when you have a monopoly is based on real life business as no competitors means no need to fight for the lower price."

The building prices are listed on your property deed. You can build up to four houses on each property of your monopoly. [12] X Research source Buildings raise the rent on your property significantly. For example, the first property on the board, Mediterranean Avenue, rents for $2 without any buildings. When you build four houses, you can charge $160!"

After you've built four houses, you can buy a hotel from the bank to replace the houses. The hotel is the heavy hitter in monopoly, and if a player lands on a hotel they’ll usually have to empty their pockets paying the rent. [13] X Research source You have to build 4 houses on a space first before you can buy a hotel; you can’t just save up for the hotel on its own."

[14] X Research source This is a great way to add a little cash to your reserves! According to the official rules, you only get $200 for passing or landing on the GO square, but some players use a house rule where you collect more whenever you land right on GO."

If you land on a spot marked \"Chance\" or \"Community Chest,\" take the top card off of the corresponding deck of the space that you landed on. These cards have effects that can cause you to earn or lose money, move you around the board, or even send you to jail. [15] X Research source When you're done reading the card, perform the instructions and then return it to the bottom of the corresponding deck. There's also the infamous \"get out of jail free\" card. You hold on to this card until you use it."

      "title": "Go to jail when you’re instructed to.",
      "content": "Go to jail when you’re instructed to. Going to jail prevents you from moving around the board until you're free, but you still can collect rent, buy houses, participate in auctions, and trade with other players. There are three possible ways to go to jail: [16] X Research source Landing on the space marked “Go to Jail.” The player goes diagonally across the board to the jail space without passing GO, and their turn ends immediately. If you pick a Chance or Community Chest card that tells you to go to jail, your turn ends immediately and you move your token to the jail square. Rolling 3 consecutive doubles on the same turn also sends you to jail immediately. Place your token into the jail cell as soon as the third double is rolled. You can get out of jail by paying $50 bail, using a Get Out of Jail Free card, or rolling doubles on your next turn. If you succeed in rolling a double to get out of jail, you move forward the given number of spaces but do not take another turn. You must leave jail on your third turn and immediately pay $50 if you fail to roll doubles on that turn."

      "content": "Make deals with other players at any time. Trading with other players is a key part of the strategy of any Monopoly game. This is usually how you obtain a monopoly to build houses and hotels. Many players also have house rules that allow them to grant rent immunity to another player, lend money to another player, or borrow from the bank without mortgaging property. [17] X Research source Do not include any house rules during your first game as including them can impact the enjoyment of the game and extend how long the game goes on for which isn't a good thing."

      "content": "Set a time limit to determine the winner (optional). If you want a faster game, try setting a timer for 1 or 2 hours. When the timer goes off, each player counts their total amount of money, the printed prices of all their unmortgaged properties, half the prices of all their mortgaged properties, and the printed prices of all houses and hotels. The richest player wins the game! [18] X Research source Monopoly is notorious for taking a very long time to play—especially if you have a lot of players. A time limit can keep a fun game from turning a little tiresome."

      "title": "Avoid awarding money for landing on free parking.",
      "content": "Avoid awarding money for landing on free parking. Many people use a variation of the rules to add more money to the game. Instead of putting tax money or other payments back in the bank, they put it in the center of the board and give it to anyone who lands on Free Parking. While it's fun to win a pile of money, it actually makes the game go on for much longer! [19] X Research source If you do want to extend the game, the “free parking jackpot” rule is a great way to allow players who are behind to get back in the game."

      "title": "Mortgage property if you can’t pay a tax or rent.",
      "content": "Mortgage property if you can’t pay a tax or rent. You can also choose to mortgage a property to buy other properties, houses, or hotels. When a property is mortgaged, no rent can be collected. To unmortgage it, you must pay 10% interest when you pay it off. [20] X Research source Mortgages have their rewards and their consequences. You should only mortgage a property to avoid bankruptcy or to make a quick boost of money for buying more properties and trading. You can also sell your mortgaged properties to other players, causing them to pay the bank if they want to collect rent on that property. The 10% interest is far better than the 50% loss from selling buildings."

    {
      "title": "Leave when you go bankrupt or keep playing until you win.",
      "content": "Leave when you go bankrupt or keep playing until you win. If you owe more money than you and your assets can afford, you're declared bankrupt and are out of the game. In official rules, your money and properties are given to the player who caused you to become bankrupt after selling all the buildings first. [21] X Research source If you want a “fairer” house rule, auction off every player’s property instead of giving it to the person who caused them to go bankrupt. Play continues until one player is left standing."
