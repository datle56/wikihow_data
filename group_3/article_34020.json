      "title": "Write down everything you will need.",
      "content": "Write down everything you will need. Making lists may not seem like something that will help you win. But, think of it this way—winners make lists. Thinking of all the things you will need for game day will reduce stress so that you can keep your mind on the game. Write down the date of the tournament, equipment you will need, your meal plan, and training schedule. Free your mind so you can visualize that winning move. [1] X Research source Important information includes information about transportation, food, drink, and what will happen in an emergency. Bring a notebook with you to practice. Then you can write down important notes right away."

    {
      "title": "Buy new equipment if needed.",
      "content": "Buy new equipment if needed. It is a good idea to make sure that you have the equipment, uniform, and shoes needed. If you find that some of the equipment is old or missing, go ahead and buy new equipment, a water bottle, etc. This is one less thing you have to stress about as it gets closer to game day. [2] X Research source Check that the equipment is up to standard. There is nothing worse than turning up on game day and finding your equipment is broken."

    {
      "title": "Cut back on the intensity of your training.",
      "content": "Cut back on the intensity of your training. No, this doesn’t mean to sit back with a bag of chips and your favorite show. It’s important to keep your mind and body in great shape, but don’t overdo it. Taper the intensity of your training about two weeks before the tournament. This reduces the chance of injury and ensures that you’re well rested for the big day. [3] X Research source You may not have a say in how much training you do if you train with a team. In this case, cut down the training you do on your own time."

    {
      "title": "Get more sleep.",
      "content": "Get more sleep. It’s hard to argue with the idea of getting more sleep. Try to increase the amount of sleep you get to 10 hours. Sorry, but this may mean cutting back on late night binge watching and video games. It will be worth it though. Get extra sleep and stick to that schedule so you guaranteed to be well rested when it comes to game day. [4] X Research source Keep a sleep diary to manage your sleep habits. There are also smartphone apps that help with this."

    {
      "title": "Drink at least 1.5 liters of water a day.",
      "content": "Drink at least 1.5 liters of water a day. Getting enough water is really important—especially for an athlete like yourself. Staying hydrated is important when you’re training and sweating a lot. Try to drink 1.5 or more liters of water a day. Keep a water bottle with you at all times to make staying hydrated easy. [5] X Research source Mix your water with fruit to give it some taste if you’re usually not a fan of drinking water. Sodas are a guilty pleasure, but you should stay away from them. They don’t do much for hydration."

    {
      "title": "Reduce meal sizes.",
      "content": "Reduce meal sizes. Do this about one week before the tournament. This doesn’t mean skipping meals or hardly eating anything at all. Slightly reducing the size of your meals will prevent weight gain that may happen because of lower intensity training. Unfortunately, that means no large pizzas, cheesy bread, soda, and ice cream for dinner tonight. That can be a reward for after the tournament! [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Pack your sports bag.",
      "content": "Pack your sports bag. Okay, now it’s getting close to the big game! You may be feeling some anxiety, but you can reduce that by having everything prepared.

[7] X Research source Put the bag by the door or in an obvious place so that you don’t walk out without it in your excitement to play the game."

      "content": "Eat a meal that is high in carbs. Let your body know that it’s about to do some hard work. Eat a meal that’s high in carbs and protein. This will boost your glycogen levels. A great meal to have would be pasta and salmon. It’s yummy and beneficial! [8] X Research source"

      "title": "Relax early in the evening.",
      "content": "Relax early in the evening. This is a great excuse to kick back earlier than usual. Try to have your dinner a little earlier than usual. It may be difficult, but turn off the TV, computer, and smart phone as early as possible. Use this time to meditate on the game or read a good book. [9] X Research source Stop drinking caffeine around 12 p.m."

      "content": "Pack a healthy lunch and snack. You don’t want to show up to the tournament with a growling stomach and realize you don’t have anything to eat.

Keep snacking up until right before the tournament, but don’t get too full. All of this food and drink will keep you energized during the tournament, and will help you play the best you can.
