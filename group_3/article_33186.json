      "content": "Give them a fake parking ticket, or send them a fake bill. Use a word processor to type up a fake parking ticket, or print a template from the web. Then, stick it under the wiper blade on their car. If they don’t have a car, type up another sort of bill or fee, like a ticket for trespassing, and mail it to them. Make it look super official, but don’t claim to be anyone official, like the cops or the city government. It’s a crime to impersonate government officials."

      "title": "Swap the photos in their frames.",
      "content": "Swap the photos in their frames. Next time your sibling is away, take all the photos or art out of the frames on their walls and swap them with funny, printed images, like memes, animal photos, or photos of another family or person altogether.

    {
      "title": "Swap your sock drawers.",
      "content": "Swap your sock drawers. Take everything from your sock and underwear drawer and place it in your sibling’s sock drawer, and take all their sock drawer stuff and put it in yours.

    {
      "title": "Give them the silent treatment, with a twist.",
      "content": "Give them the silent treatment, with a twist. This one works best if you recruit the rest of your family.

    {
      "title": "Pretend to see something cool that isn’t there.",

Insist they’re out there to drive your sibling wild. For example, you might say, “Woah, look at all those eagles! Oh man you just missed them, they flew away. Wait there’s a few!

If you can’t find it, use the Search option. Next, find the Language settings. Change it from English to any other language. [7] X Research source Your sibling will get frustrated when they try to use their phones.

There are tons of classic prank phone call ideas, and here are a few to get you started: [9] X Research source Tell them they’ve won tickets to see their favorite musician. Pretend like you’re just picking up the phone, and they called you, to confuse them. Then, keep calling them and pretending that they keep calling you.

      "title": "Send them a gif of the “typing…” dots.",
      "content": "Send them a gif of the “typing…” dots. You know those dots that show up when someone is typing a message?

      "title": "Glue their deodorant shut.",
      "content": "Glue their deodorant shut. First, remove the lid of their deodorant. Squeeze a large amount of superglue all around the edge of the lid. Replace the lid quickly.

      "title": "Create useless soap with nail polish.",
      "content": "Create useless soap with nail polish. Find a dry bar of soap and a bottle of clear nail polish. Paint the bar of soap with a few thick coats of clear nail polish. Allow the soap to dry for 5-10 minutes between each coat. After 3 or 4 coats, the soap will be completely sealed in the nail polish. When someone tries to use it in the shower, it won’t create any lather at all. This technique works best with a brand new bar of soap. Older bars of soap can be soft and difficult to paint."

    {
      "title": "Make useless shampoo.",

      "title": "Hide stopwatches in their room.",
      "content": "Hide stopwatches in their room. Find or purchase 2 or 3 cheap alarm clocks or stopwatches . Set them all for different times before your sibling is supposed to wake up. Next, hide the alarms around their room—in the closet, under their bed, behind a book. When the clocks start ringing they’ll have to get up and search for them before going back to sleep. [12] X Research source For example, if your sibling wakes up at seven am, set the alarms for five, five thirty, and six am. Don’t do this right before a big day at school. Otherwise, you may exhaust them on an important day."

Sooner or later, your sibling won’t be able to resist trying a bite! [13] X Research source Don’t use an old kitchen sponge. The icing won’t stick to the wet surface and it will smell bad. It’s best if you stack kitchen sponges, so that they look like a big piece of layer cake."

When they take a drink, they’ll get a mouthful of hot sauce. [16] X Research source Fill the cup with ice after inserting the straw and hot sauce packet.
