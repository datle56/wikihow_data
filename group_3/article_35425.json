If your dog has an infection that occurred because of the salivary mucocele, your vet might prescribe antibiotics to rid the dog of the infection prior to any surgical treatments. Antibiotics might also be prescribed to help reduce the inflammation. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Remove the salivary mucocele surgically.",
      "content": "Remove the salivary mucocele surgically. Most of the time, treatment for this is surgical. This helps reduce any recurring inflammation. Your vet will diagnose the dog and determine the best kind of treatment for your dog’s case. This is why it’s important to know which side the swelling started on. A vet will need to know which side the infected gland is on so she can remove it. Sometimes, if the swelling is under the tongue, the salivary glands under the tongue can be removed, but this can be demanding. Instead, many surgeons favor marsupialization of the swelling. This means they make an incision into the lump to let it drain out, then suture the edges to the tongue so that the lump stays permanently open and saliva cannot build up again. Instead, it drains into the mouth.

      "title": "Look for swelling of the chin.",
      "content": "Look for swelling of the chin. One of the major signs that a dog might have a salivary mucocele is swelling under the chin. The swelling occurs in the angle of the jaw. In the early stages, the swelling sits to either the left or the right side. The longer the mucocele has been present, the more it spreads and it can be difficult to tell which side it arose from.

The AKC advocates for the responsible ownership of dogs and promotes purebred dog events, such as the Westminster Dog Show. Go to source If you notice something isn't quite right with the dog's chin, make a mental note of which side was swollen first. This helps the vet figure out which gland is damaged. If in doubt as to which side is affected, stand directly in front of the dog and compare one side with the other to see which is more swollen. The swelling will probably feel a bit squishy when you press it, like a fluid-filled balloon."

      "title": "Watch for swelling under the tongue.",
      "content": "Watch for swelling under the tongue. This swelling can be more difficult to spot. Sometimes the swelling is subtle and can be there for a long time before it becomes large enough to be noticeable. This swelling looks like large pink bubbles or cysts under the tongue, and they can reach a size where they displace how the tongue sits and push it over to one side. Swelling under the tongue can also cause problems chewing or cause bloody saliva. [7] X Research source To check for swellings under the tongue, watch the dog very carefully when she yawns. Alternatively, open her mouth and gently move the tongue to one side so that you can get a look underneath."

Look for swelling along the eyelids or in the throat region."

      "content": "Check for trouble eating. Since salivary mucoceles aren’t generally painful, your dog won’t display signs of pain. A salivary mucocele in the mouth can make it hard for the pet to eat because the tongue is displaced. This can cause her to bite down on her tongue or make it difficult to eat. [10] X Research source She may also have trouble chewing on toys."
