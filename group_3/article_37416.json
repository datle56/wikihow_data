      "content": "Leave him wondering whether you'll reply. Don't be too eager to respond. After all, he's the one who ghosted you, so it's only fair to give him a taste of his own medicine. There's no set time to make him wait, but waiting at least 10-15 minutes is a good start. Feel free to hold off on your reply until the following day, especially if he texts you late at night! It's okay if he sees that you read his text and didn't respond. You're not obligated to reply right away to every message you get!"

      "content": "Give yourself a moment to work through your feelings. When you get that long-awaited text, you probably feel at least a little excited, but you may also be a little disappointed or angry that he disappeared in the first place. Reflect on these feelings for a moment—you might find that it affects how you choose to respond to him. [1] X Expert Source John Keegan Dating Coach Expert Interview. 25 May 2021. If you get caught up in the excitement of hearing from him, you might be inclined to just brush off the fact that he ghosted you. That might make him think it's okay to do it again in the future. If you take some time to think about it, on the other hand, you might decide to say something like, \"If you're going to be a part of my life, you'll have to treat me better than realize that if he's going to be a part of your life, he's going to have to treat you better than that—and that's what you should tell him. You might even decide you don't want to answer him at all, and that's fine! [2] X Expert Source Imad Jbara Dating Coach Expert Interview. 22 September 2021."

      "content": "Don't just pick up the conversation where you left off. If you do, he might think that he can disappear from your inbox for as long as he pleases, and you'll always be available. [3] X Expert Source Imad Jbara Dating Coach Expert Interview. 22 September 2021. Go ahead and address the elephant in the room by saying something like: \"Oh wow, I haven't heard from you in a while. What's up?\" \"Hm.. Surprised to hear from you, thought you ghosted.\" \"What happened last time we talked? You disappeared!\" \"Sorry I don't have your number saved. Who's this?\""

      "content": "Do a vibe check to see if his reaction seems legit. It's okay to be a little skeptical about whatever he says when you ask him why he ghosted you, especially if you suspect he's kind of a player . But, to be fair, go ahead and listen when he tells you what happened. Then, compare his answer to whatever you already know about him to see how plausible it sounds. If you know he has a new puppy and he tells you his dog chewed up his phone, there's a good chance that could be true. If he's been posting to Snapchat all week, though, don't be afraid to call him out on it! If his dating profile says he's an only child and he tells you he was out of town for his brother's wedding, that's pretty suspicious. Is your gut telling you that he's being dishonest? It's usually a good idea to trust your intuition."

      "content": "Explain how you felt when he ghosted you. Keep this part brief—maybe 1-2 sentences about why it bothered you that he just ditched the convo. Use \"I\" statements to describe your feelings, which will help keep him from getting defensive. [4] X Expert Source Mark Rosenfeld Dating & Relationship Coach Expert Interview. 11 June 2021. Say something like: \"I thought we were really vibing, so I felt disappointed when I didn't hear from you for so long.\" \"I was kind of confused when you stopped texting in the middle of our conversation.\" \"I felt worried after you didn't text me for a few days, but when I saw you were still active on social media, I realized you'd ghosted me. That made me feel hurt and angry.\""

      "content": "Politely explain he has to try harder than that. You're a superstar, and you deserve to be treated like one! If he wants the privilege of texting the always-amazing YOU, he's going to have to work for it—and leaving you on read for a week isn't going to cut it. Try saying: \"I don't really spend time chasing after people who can't make time for me.\" \"If you're into me, it shouldn't be hard to respond to my texts.\" \"I'm only dating intentionally right now, so I don't really have time for someone who only texts once a month.\""

If you stand up for yourself, he's going to have a lot more respect for you than he will if you just let him treat you however he wants. By making it clear that you're not okay with him ghosting you, he'll see that you have standards and self-confidence. If he's not into that, he's probably not the kind of guy you want to be around anyway. [5] X Expert Source Mark Rosenfeld Dating & Relationship Coach Expert Interview. 11 June 2021. Say something like, \"We went on two dates and then you just stopped calling. That's fine, I can handle it, but I don't usually give second chances when people ghost.\" Or you might say, \"I've been busy too, but I still make time to text people who are important to me, especially if they texted me first.\""

If he generally acts pretty interested in you and his excuse seems plausible, it's okay to give him the benefit of the doubt. Say something like, \"I guess I'll let it slide this time, but only because you're so cute ;)\" You can tell he's into you if he's usually responsive to your calls and texts, he acts excited to see you, and he invites you to do things with him.

Maybe he doesn't have a great excuse, but it's been a while since he ghosted you and he texts out of the blue that something reminded you of him. You should still let him know that it's not cool that he ditched you, but you're obviously on his mind, so it's okay if you want to spend some time catching up.

It's called breadcrumbing, which means he's dropping little bits of attention your way—just enough to keep you interested. He might be keeping you around as an option in case he wants to hook up down the road, but he's not serious about getting to know you, and you deserve better. [8] X Expert Source Imad Jbara Dating Coach Expert Interview. 22 September 2021. To test the waters, wait until he texts you, then invite him to do something innocent with you, like grabbing coffee or taking your dog to the dog park. If it doesn't happen, it's a good sign he's breadcrumbing. [9] X Expert Source John Keegan Dating Coach Expert Interview. 25 May 2021."

Sooner or later, someone's going to come along who gives you the time and attention you really deserve. Enjoy your life !
