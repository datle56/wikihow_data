[1] X Expert Source Lia Huynh, LMFT Licensed Marriage & Family Therapist Expert Interview. 5 May 2022. What you wear should be completely up to you—it’s your wardrobe and your body! If your boyfriend is telling you otherwise, that is a red flag."

      "content": "It's up to you how you express yourself. Your appearance is an expression of who you are. The reason people dress the way they do goes back to how they feel about themselves, and how they want others to see them. You have sole authority over how you present yourself.

      "title": "It’s unfair to you.",
      "content": "It’s unfair to you. When someone tells you what to wear, it implies that you’re incapable of making that decision for yourself, which isn't true. It’s not fair for your boyfriend to suggest that you can’t pick your own outfits."

Some men try to control what their partner wears because they're insecure and worried about their partner getting attention from other people because of their clothes. [3] X Expert Source Lia Huynh, LMFT Licensed Marriage & Family Therapist Expert Interview. 5 May 2022. However, just because someone is insecure doesn't mean they get to dictate what their partner can and can't wear.

      "content": "He may have regressive attitudes towards women and sex. Some men think that there’s something wrong with women wearing revealing clothing. They wrongly believe that the way a woman dresses means they’re promiscuous. If this is where your boyfriend is coming from, he may have some problematic and misguided beliefs. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Tell him that you don’t appreciate it.",
      "content": "Tell him that you don’t appreciate it. Stand up to him and make it clear that you aren’t comfortable with him telling you how to dress. You can be curt and straightforward if you want to really put your foot down, or laugh it off for a more dismissive approach. Just make it clear that this isn’t okay. [7] X Research source You might say: “You don’t get to tell me what to wear.” “I appreciate the suggestion, but I’ll pass.” “Why do you think it’s appropriate to tell me what to wear?” “I’m not a doll you get to dress up. Please don’t do that.”"

      "content": "Have a conversation about why he thinks this is okay. Ask him to explain why he thinks what he’s doing is appropriate so that you can work through this together. Maybe he doesn’t understand why this would be rude, or maybe he did a poor job of communicating and didn’t mean it. This can also separate abusive guys from guys who just don’t understand why they’re saying something rude. [8] X Research source You might say, “Hey, why did you do that? You get why telling me what to wear is kind of insulting, right? What was going through your head there.” A reasonable guy might say, “Sorry, I was trying to be funny; we’re going to a formal dinner and I don’t think they’ll let you in with sandals. I wasn’t trying to insult you.” An abusive jerk might go, “I didn’t like what you’re wearing. It’s too revealing. Change.”"

It is completely reasonable to break up with someone who thinks it’s okay to tell you what you are or are not allowed to wear. If you take this as a sign that it’s time to pack your bags and leave, don’t blame yourself. [9] X Expert Source Jay Reid, LPCC Licensed Professional Clinical Counselor Expert Interview. 7 August 2020.

      "content": "It’s reasonable if you’re attending an event with a dress code. If you happen to be going to an event with a dress code and you either didn’t get the memo or you misinterpreted what the dress code was, it’s okay for him to ask if you’d be able to change your clothes. He still shouldn’t be making demands though, so the wording matters quite a bit here. For example, “Hey, they mentioned it’s black tie only on the invitation. Do you think your red dress works?” is a totally reasonable comment. If he says something like, “You can’t wear that top. It’s inappropriate,” this may be a red flag."

      "content": "It’s okay if he suggests something kindly because he’s attracted to it. If your boyfriend playfully asks you to wear “that cute red dress,” he’s flirting in a playful way (and he thinks you’re hot in that dress). It’s normal for people to say things like this when they’re comfortable with their partner, so unless he’s making demands, this one isn’t a big deal. [10] X Expert Source Lia Huynh, LMFT Licensed Marriage & Family Therapist Expert Interview. 5 May 2022. So long as he isn’t dictating what you wear and merely making a request, he’s probably not a bad guy. With that said, feel free to speak up if it makes you uncomfortable when he does this."

Everybody is different, and if you happen to find your boyfriend’s suggestions and ideas helpful, it’s okay! Alternatively, if you’re the kind of person who actually really likes it when your boyfriend “dresses you up,” that’s alright, too. So long as you consent to this, you’re happy, and he’s not a controlling jerk, you shouldn’t feel bad about this arrangement. Hey, if you’ve got a crazy stylish boyfriend or he designs clothes for a living, maybe you appreciate his comments! There are girls out there who really enjoy being submissive and actively seek out partners who are slightly “controlling” in this way. If that’s you, don’t feel guilty about it! Again, he still shouldn’t be demanding that you dress a certain way. These should be suggestions."
