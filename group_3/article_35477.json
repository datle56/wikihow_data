While the laws vary by country and region, in a lot of places it’s illegal to record a meeting without permission from all the participants. Before you try recording a Zoom meeting, look up your local laws and tell the host and other participants about your intentions if necessary. In general, it’s safest and easiest to just have the host record."

      "content": "Add the screen recording option to your Control Center. If you're not the host of the meeting (or if you don't have the paid version of Zoom), you can use this method to record your meeting. Unfortunately, this method is likely to result in a video recording with no sound, but you might be able to bypass this problem by accessing the meeting through a browser instead of the Zoom app. First, here's how to add Screen Recording to your Control Center: Open the Control Center on your iPhone or iPad. With most newer devices, you can do this by swiping down from the top right side of the screen. If you have an iPhone with a Home button, swipe up from the bottom. Press and hold an empty area of the Control Center, then tap Add a Control . Tap Screen Recording . If you don’t see it, use the search bar at the top of the screen to search for it. Once you tap the control, it will be instantly added to your Control Center."

If you see an option to join the meeting from your browser, tap the browser link instead of opening the meeting in the Zoom app. This option will only work if the meeting administrator has enabled the “Join from your browser” option. If you have administrator privileges, you can do this by logging into the Zoom website (not the app), then going to Account Management > Account Settings > Meeting > In Meeting (Advanced) and toggling on Join meeting from browser . [4] X Research source You can either start/join the meeting now, or wait until you’ve started recording your screen. If you’re not able to get this option to work, you may have to record the sound from the meeting on an external device and sync it with the video later."
