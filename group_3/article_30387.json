      "content": "Break down any misconceptions you have around sex. Information about sex is frequently cis-centric, transgender porn tends to be fetishistic, and general transphobia is common in dating and sex. This can hurt many people's self-esteem and their ideas of what their \"role\" is. It's important to deconstruct old messages you might have received about sex—they don't include trans people, and they're harmful to everyone, even cis people. Some main ideas to remember are: [1] X Research source <b>Warning:</b> Some references contain profanity and/or NSFW imagery. [2] X Research source [3] X Research source Your sexual role is not based on your gender or genitals. Having a penis doesn't mean you need to penetrate someone, and having a vagina doesn't mean you need to be penetrated. Nor does that mean you can't like or dislike those things. Your sexual orientation is separate from your gender. Transmasculine people don't have to have sex with women, transfeminine people don't have to have sex with men, and nonbinary people aren't all asexual. You can be gay, straight, bi, pan, asexual, or any other orientation, no matter what your gender is. Sex isn't just penis-in-vagina or penis-in-anus. Oral sex, manual sex, mutual masturbation, and many more activities are still sex, and can be just as satisfying (if not more so). You don't need to penetrate or be penetrated for it to \"count\". There's no right or wrong as long as it's consensual. Sex should be a mutually enjoyable experience for anyone involved. Don't focus on \"normal\"; focus on consent and pleasure. Being trans or nonbinary doesn't exclude you from sex. Your gender doesn't make you a fetish object or undesirable. Trans and nonbinary people can and do have happy, healthy sex lives, whether through casual sex or a committed relationship."

Can you get protection, birth control (if needed), and sexual health screenings? Do you like your partner? Regardless of whether you love them, you should want to have sex with them because you're attracted to them—not because they're the only person who's expressed interest in you. Have you already come out to your partner? Is your relationship stable and healthy? (Sex won't save a failing relationship or make your partner treat you better, even if they say otherwise.) Do you trust your partner to listen to you when you say \"no,\" ask them to stop, or change your mind? What about trusting them to not do anything you've told them you don't like? Do you feel close enough to your partner? While some people are okay with casual hookups, others need a strong bond with their partner, and some people only want to have sex after marriage. Do you know what you'll do if you get an STI, get an injury from sex, or accidentally get pregnant/get your partner pregnant (if applicable)?

Just ask them, \"Can I give you a hickey?\" or \"I want to put the vibrator between your legs. Is that okay?\" Ask questions. It doesn't have to be anything complicated—it can be as simple as \"Do you like it when I touch you like that?\", \"Does that feel good to you?\", or \"Do you want to stop?\" Listen to them. They might tell you clearly when they like or dislike something, but they'll also probably make noise if they're enjoying themselves. Give them feedback. Tell them when something feels good or isn't the right spot, guide their hand as needed, or just make noise—sighs, moans, and groans can be informative, too!

It's okay to ask to stop or try something else if you're uncomfortable, or to take a quick break.

You could also experience a mix of these things, or feel emotions you can't put a name on. Nothing's wrong with feeling the way you do, whether that's positive or negative; you're not a bad person for it.

Any earlier can put you at increased risk of STIs if you give oral sex. Bring lube and protection yourself (whether that's condoms, gloves, dental dams, or all three). Don't expect the other person to have them. Don't bring too much money with you, in case you get robbed. Be aware of your surroundings. Know where you are, and know where you're going. If you're consuming alcohol, avoid getting overly drunk. Watch your drink being made, don't leave drinks unattended, and never accept open drinks.
