You can ping another computer on your network, a website, a printer, a smartphone, or any other location on the internet that has a hostname or IP address. The packets sent by ping include an ICMP ECHO_REQUEST, which is basically a request that says \"reply if you get this.\""

These replies contain lots of helpful information, including the amount of time it took for each packet to reach the destination, and whether any packets were lost along the way. This information is easy to interpret and super helpful for diagnosing network problems."

When you press Enter , you'll see the echoed results as individual entries. Basic ping examples: To ping a website like Facebook, you'd type ping www.facebook.com or ping facebook.com . To ping an IPv4 IP address, such as 10.0.0.1, you'd type ping 10.0.0.1 . To ping an IPv6 IP address, you'll add the -6 option. To ping Facebook's IPv6 address, you'd use ping -6 2a03:2880:f02c:13:face:b00c:0:3 . You can also ping your own computer (localhost) to make sure your network adapter is working property. To do this, you'd use ping localhost or ping 127.0.0.1 . For more ping examples, see Advanced Ping Examples ."

      "content": "Check the ping statistics. At the bottom of your ping replies, you'll see a section that says \"(host or IP) ping statistics.\" In Linux, you'll find helpful information in this section, including: Packets transmitted and packets received. For example, if you stopped the ping after sending 15 packets, you'll see \"15 packets transmitted,\" followed by the number of packets received by the host. Packets that are sent but not received indicate packet loss. If some packets are lost, you'll notice a slower or inconsistent connection between your computer and the host. For example, lag in games and sluggish downloads . Percentage of packets lost. For example, if none of the packets were received by the host, you'll see \"100% packet loss\" in the reply. If 2 out of 4 were received, you'll see \"50% packet loss.\" Packet loss can be caused by many things, including network congestion, router problems, network hardware issues, and configuration issues on the remote server. [1] X Research source If 100% of packets are lost, there might not actually be a problem. Some servers discard ICMP packets as a security measure to avoid ping flooding, a type of denial of service attack. Round trip time (RTT). This tells you how long it took for each packet to be sent to the host, plus the amount of time it took for Linux to receive the reply in milliseconds (MS). [2] X Research source RTT is shown as multiple values: The minimum RTT (the shortest amount of time), average RTT, MAX RTT (the longest), and then MDEV RTT ( mean deviation ). [3] X Research source You'll also see a \"time\" value, which tells you the total amount of time the entire process took from start to finish."

      "content": "Interpret ping errors. If you're pinging a server, you might encounter one of these errors: Unknown host: If you're trying to ping host or domain name that cannot be resolved, you'll see this error. This could mean the host or domain does not exist, but also may mean the name cannot be translated into an IP address by your DNS servers . Destination host unreachable: This error means your computer was unable to send any packets to the address. This could indicate a problem on your network, or somewhere on the internet between your own network and the remote host's. Request timed out: In this case, the problem is definitely not related to your own computer or network. Your computer sent the ping request, but did not receive a reply. The host may not be online, there could be a network problem on the host's end, or the ping could've been blocked by the host's firewall . Name or service not known: This error means the hostname or address you're trying to ping does not exist. If the host does exist, there's a problem with your network configuration."

If you just want to do a quick ping test that ends on its own, you can specify the number of packets to send using the -c option. For example, to send 5 packets to facebook.com, you'd use ping -c 5 facebook.com . The ping will stop on its own after 5 packets are sent and report the results. As an alternative, you can use the -w option to stop the ping after a number of seconds instead of specifying the packet number. For example, to ping Facebook for 10 seconds and then display the results, you'd use ping -w 10 facebook.com ."

If you want to increase or decrease the time between packets sent, you can use the -i option with ping. [4] X Research source To increase the wait to 3 seconds between packets in your ping to Facebook, you'd use ping -i 3 facebook.com . To decrease the wait to half of one second, you'd use ping -i 0.5 facebook.com ."

For example, if you're running into performance trouble on your own network, you can try to send larger packets to see if your traffic is throttled. To send 1000 bytes instead of the default, you'd use ping -s 1000 facebook.com ."

This outputs packets as fast as they return or 100 times per second, whichever is greater. [6] X Research source You can do this using the -f option. Proceed with caution, as a ping flood can overload your network. Because you'll need root access to do a ping flood, you'll need to preface the command with sudo . To perform a flood ping, use sudo ping -f <hostname> ."

For example, if the local IP address 10.0.0.2 is unreachable and you want to know when it comes back up, you'd use ping -a 10.0.0.2 .

For example, ping -q facebook.com . However, you won't see the statistics at all until you press Ctrl + C . Because of this, you'll usually use -q in conjunction with specifying the number of packets to send. A better way to use -q is with the -c flag, which allows you to specify the number of packets to send. For example: ping -c 5 -q facebook.com . In this example, you'll send 5 packets of data to Facebook only. Once the packets are sent and the echoes are received, the statistics will appear."
