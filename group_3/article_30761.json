      "content": "Get some background from your boyfriend about his parents. Ask about the dynamic between his parents and what they’re like. Do they live together still, or are they divorced? Does he have step-parents? Is his family super strict, or do they like to joke around and have fun? Getting some background knowledge will help you feel more confident when it comes time to actually meet up. [1] X Research source You can also ask your boyfriend about some good conversation topics to talk about when meeting his parents . For instance, maybe his dad is super into fly fishing, or his mom is a painter. You can prepare some questions in your head beforehand to show an interest in their lives. Ask about his parents’ culture, too. If it’s different from yours, there may be rules you need to follow so you don’t offend them. Certified professional matchmaker Shana Tibi agrees that understanding “cultural norms, cultural expectations, and religious norms is important. Know what's going to happen at the meeting—is it going to be a meal, or are you going to a family event? Understand as much about what's going to happen before you get there, so you feel comfortable and prepared.” [2] X Expert Source Shana Tibi Certified Professional Matchmaker Expert Interview. 19 October 2021."

Take note of the location, too—if you’re going to a 5-star restaurant, you might wear something a little nicer. Stay away from ripped jeans or anything short enough that you’d wear it on a night out, since that can feel a little too informal. If you aren’t sure what to wear, ask your boyfriend for his input. [3] X Research source If you have tattoos or piercings, it’s up to you whether or not you want to cover them up or leave them as-is. If you aren’t sure, ask your boyfriend how his parents might feel about them. Keep in mind that first impressions are lasting impressions, so you'll want to look your best to represent yourself in the best way possible. Reader Poll: We asked 698 wikiHow readers what they thought would help make the best first impression with in-laws, and 50% of them said dressing well and grooming yourself. [Take Poll] This is a good idea when you're meeting your boyfriend's parents, too. Wardrobe Consultant Taissha G. LaReau says that “You want to look polished and put together. You don't want to show too much skin, but you also don't want to wear clothing that doesn't represent your personality. If you wear something more casual, cardigans always look polished and put together. Mixing comfort with formality is a great option.” [4] X Expert Source Taissha G.

If his parents want you to come over for dinner or head to your place, that’s totally fine! Try to meet his parents one-on-one before you meet the rest of his family. Although his aunts, uncles, and cousins might be dying to meet you, seeing everyone all at once can be a little overwhelming. Marriage therapist Omar Ruiz, LMFT, says, “If meeting at a local restaurant, have enough funds to be able to cover the meal. Depending on his parents, they might respect you just for offering to pay for the meal, but might say ‘No, we have this covered’ or ‘We might split the cost.’ It’s about making a good impression.” [6] X Expert Source Omar Ruiz, LMFT Licensed Marriage & Family Therapist Expert Interview. 14 October 2022."

Look them in the eye, remember to smile (and relax), and introduce yourself by name. Let them know how happy you are to meet them, and offer them a chance to introduce themselves right back. [9] X Research source For example, say, “Hi–I’m [Name]. It’s so lovely to finally meet you! You can also say, “It’s wonderful to meet you. My name is [Name].” If they’re hosting you at their home, you can include things like “Thank you for having me,” along with a compliment about where they live. Initially, your boyfriend may want to introduce you to them himself, so check with him beforehand. Once he does, go ahead and introduce yourself in the same way you normally would. If you brought them a small gift, offer it to them after you’ve both introduced yourselves."

If they offer you wine or a drink at dinner, you can accept, but stick to 1-2 drinks throughout the night so you don’t get too relaxed around them and say something inappropriate. If you decide to avoid drinking altogether, politely decline their offer by saying something like, “Thank you so much. I won’t this time, because I’m driving.” If you’re sober and his parents offer you alcohol without knowing, politely let them know that you don’t drink. They should respect your decision and not make you feel awkward about it in any way. Likewise, if you know one or both of his parents are recovering alcoholics, don’t bring wine or drink alcohol in their presence unless your boyfriend has told you they’re absolutely ok with it.
