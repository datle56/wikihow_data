      "content": "Recruit at least 4 helpers. A large acrylic hot tub can weigh upwards of 1,000 pounds (450 kg), so you’ll need plenty of able-bodied helpers. Ideally, you’ll have 4 people lift the hot tub, and another person slide dollies under its base and help guide it. [1] X Research source It's essential to have enough hands on deck. If you don't have enough helpers or the right equipment, you should hire professionals. You (or a helper) should also have basic knowledge about how to drain and disconnect your tub. A hot tub party can be a great incentive, so invite your helpers to one after you reinstall the tub."

      "content": "Rent a truck large enough to hold the hot tub. You’ll need a truck if you’re moving the tub to a location other than elsewhere in your home. Measure your hot tub, then rent a moving truck that can accommodate it. Look for local rental companies or rent one from a local home improvement store. [2] X Research source Go for a moving truck with a ramp, as you won’t want to have to lift the tub high off the ground."

      "content": "Make sure you have moving straps and blankets. If you don’t have them already, rent straps and blankets from your truck rental company. [3] X Research source You’ll need at least 2 or 3 large blankets to cover the tub and at least 4 straps to secure to the truck’s inside wall."

      "content": "Rent an appliance dolly if you have to deal with stairs. Furniture dollies are great for flat surfaces, but can’t go up and down stairs. Instead, you’ll need an appliance dolly (also known as a hand truck), which you can rent from your truck rental company or a local home improvement store. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Get 4x4 lumber boards from a home improvement store. You can rest the hot tub on 4 lumber boards when you slide dollies under it and when you unload it. They'll make it easier to center the dollies and help ensure no one gets their fingers squashed during unloading. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Open the drain access panel and attach a hose to the spout. For many models, you’ll use a Phillips head screwdriver to open the access panel. After opening the panel, you should find a drainage spout. Thread a garden hose onto the spout, then place the other end of the hose where you want the water to drain. [8] X Research source Drain the water into the street or a gutter instead of your lawn or garden. Your plants won’t like chlorinated water. Drainage procedures vary by model, so double check your owner’s manual."

[10] X Research source Check your owner’s manual for specific instructions about removing your hot tub’s cover. You’ll likely need to unscrew its hinges, so be sure to keep the screws in a safe place until you reinstall it."

Then slide furniture dollies at the tub's front and back sides. Make sure the dollies are centered at both ends, then slide the boards out to lower the tub so its base sits flat on the dollies. If your dollies have straps, secure them to the hot tub. [11] X Research source Slowly push the tub to the moving truck, and keep an eye on the dollies to make sure they don’t slide out of position."

Lift and push up the side opposite the one that will rest on the ground. Have 2 people on the other side to guide the tub and ensure it doesn’t tip over. Once the tub is on its side, slide the appliance dolly under it so the base of the tub faces the dolly. [12] X Research source Make sure the side that rests on the ground doesn’t have any access or control panels. The weight of the tub might damage them. Wrap the dolly’s straps around the tub and make sure they’re secured tightly. Then carefully lift the tub and dolly backward to put the weight of the load onto the dolly’s wheels. Have at least 2 people guide the dolly from the front and 2 from the back. Go up or down stairs one step at a time, and make sure everyone is ready for the next step before proceeding."

As you roll the tub up the ramp slowly and steadily, make sure it stays balanced. Have 2 people on either side to make sure it doesn’t tip. [13] X Research source If you’re using an appliance dolly, you’ll have to pull the dolly up the ramp backwards, or so the side of the dolly with the handle goes up the ramp first.

Tie it securely with moving straps so it doesn’t jostle around and get damaged during transport. You’re now ready to head to your new location—drive safely! [15] X Research source If you’re using furniture dollies, leave them in place under the tub. The weight of the tied-down tub will keep them in place. If you’re using an appliance dolly, you can keep it strapped to the tub, but you should take precautions to prevent it from damaging the tub during transport. Slide a blanket between the appliance dolly and the tub, then wrap moving straps around the dolly and tub to secure both to the inside of the truck."

It might seem like you should cover the tub with blankets throughout the entire moving process, but you’re better off using them only when the tub is inside the truck. Even if they’re taped or tied around the tub, moving blankets are slippery, and you wouldn’t want someone to lose their grip. Just be careful and proceed slowly if you have to navigate tight spaces."

To go up, pull the appliance dolly so the handle side goes up the stairwell first. When going down, the side of the dolly with the hot tub should go down the stairwell first.

If you’re using an appliance dolly, unstrap it, slide it out from under the tub, then carefully lower the tub’s base onto the boards. [18] X Research source You can then lift the tub from its sides and slide out the boards. The boards will help ensure no one gets their fingers caught when you lower the tub to the ground."
