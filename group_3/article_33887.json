      "content": "Check with your local wildlife agency before you harvest the snails. Some species of land snails may be illegal to kill where you are, so call your local wildlife agency and check that it’s okay to harvest them first. You may also be able to find this information on their website. [1] X Research source Not all snails are safe for consumption. The helix aspersa , Cepaea nemoralis , Cepaea hortensis , Achatina fulica , Helix aperta and Otala punctata are all edible. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Collect the largest land snails you can find. You can find edible fresh snails in your own backyard or from certain grocery stores. If you don’t have snails near you, there are also snail farms you can visit to harvest them. [3] X Research source Inspect the snails for any cracks and discoloration like red or pink and avoid them. You should only collect live snails. Dead snails could contain parasites and bacteria. If you can’t find fresh snails around you, purchase a can of snails from the grocery store or online instead. You don't have to do the steps in the first section if you buy pre-prepared snails in a can. Smaller snails will procreate later and increase the snail population on your property."

      "title": "Keep the snails in a bucket for a week.",
      "content": "Keep the snails in a bucket for a week. Fasting the snails will force them to empty their digestive tracts and will make them more tender. During this time, provide the snails with a small pool of water so that they don’t die. Wrap the top of the bucket with plastic wrap and punch holes in it. The plastic wrap will prevent snails from escaping the bucket. [4] X Research source It’s necessary to fast the snails or they won’t be edible."

      "content": "Place the snails in a salted pot of boiling water for 90 minutes. Bring a large pot of water to a boil and place the snails in the water. Reduce the heat to a simmer and continue to boil them. Stir the snails every 10-15 minutes while they cook. [5] X Research source Add a sprig of thyme and 2-3 bay leaves to the water to add flavor."

If you don't want to eat the snails immediately, you can store the cooked escargot in the refrigerator for up to 2 days. [15] X Research source To reheat escargot put it back into the oven at 400 °F (204 °C) and bake it for 10 minutes. Store the shells in an airtight container."
