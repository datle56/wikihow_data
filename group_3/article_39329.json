It feels like I just got here!” “I knew something would happen in the show’s season finale, but I didn’t expect that! Sheesh!”"

      "content": "Use “sheesh” alongside a sarcastic quip to be playful. Because “Sheesh” is often used to express frustration, you can use it when pretending to be exasperated (or when saying anything sarcastic to someone). For example, you might use it to respond to a friend teasing you or make a sarcastic comment about yourself. Them : “Dang, you have huge circles under your eyes. Have you slept at all the last week?” You : “Sheesh, thanks for the compliment! I’m really feeling the love.”"

      "title": "“Sheesh” may come from the expression “jeez.”",
      "content": "“Sheesh” may come from the expression “jeez.” There’s no definitive origin story for “Sheesh,” though many believe it may be a modified version of “Jeez,” another exclamation indicating surprise or exasperation. “Jeez” is, in turn, a shortened slang version of “Jesus.” [3] X Research source On the other hand, some speculate that “Sheesh” comes from “Shhh,” which is an interjection also used to express surprise (or shush people, depending on the context). However, the actual origins of “Sheesh” aren’t well-documented beyond its first known use in 1955."
