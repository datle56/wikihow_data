Excel has a built-in data analysis add-in called \"Analysis ToolPak.\" You can check to see if it's active by clicking the Data tab. If you don't see the Data Analysis option, you will need to enable it: [1] X Trustworthy Source Microsoft Support Technical support and product information from Microsoft. Go to source Windows: Open the File tab (or press Alt+F) and select Options (Windows). Click Add-Ins on the left side of the window. Select Excel Add-ins next to \"manage\" and click Go . In the new window, check the box next to \"Analysis ToolPak\", then click OK . This will enable the built-in data analysis add-in. Mac: Click Tools and then Excel Add-ins . Check the box next to Analysis ToolPak and click OK . Note that you may need to click Browse to find the Analysis ToolPak . If the Data Analysis tool doesn't appear in the Data tab, close and reopen Excel."
