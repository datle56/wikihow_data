Taking a screenshot will send a notification to the other person, so make sure you're OK with them knowing you're taking the screenshot. The method for taking screenshots varies depending on your phone: iPhone - Press and hold the Power and Home buttons. Android - Not every phone can take screenshots, but most newer ones can. Below are instructions for a few of the most popular Android models. Samsung Galaxy S Series - Press and hold the Power and Home buttons. Nexus Series, HTC One - Press and hold the Power and Volume Down buttons."
