The braid is not going to be straight down the back of your head. If you’re going for a romantic look, allow the part to be messy. If you want to go for something more fun, try a zig-zag part."

Make sure the shortest pieces aren't too short to braid. If the part is on the right side, make sure the hair is on the left side. If the part is on the left side, make sure the hair is on the right side. If your hair is medium length and too short for one side braid, 2 side braids (i.e. pigtails) might work better. Or try 1 of these side braids just around the hairline."

The area underneath your ear will be the anchor point for your braid, so don’t move the braid around once you get started. The sections will be easier to control if your hair is a little damp.

If you have thinner, silkier hair, you can do a knotless braid by tying the end with a few strands of hair.

Then, brush the hair over that shoulder. If you want to part your hair, the part should be on the opposite side of your head from your hair. If your hair is going to be over your right shoulder, part it on the left, and vice versa. If you don't want to part your hair, just brush all of your hair towards the shoulder where your braid will be."

If your braid is going to be over your left shoulder, begin the braid under your right ear. Start by separating a small section of hair from the bottom of the sweep of hair going across the back of your neck. This section should be a triangle 2 to 3 inches (5 to 8 cm) wide. The goal of this braid is to wrap the side braid around the bottom of your head and over 1 shoulder for a more romantic, finished look. Another option is to begin this French braid at the top of your head. This can start at the part line. [4] X Expert Source Ndeye Anta Niang Professional Hair Stylist & Master Braider Expert Interview. 10 January 2020. To begin your braid in this way, follow the same French braiding instructions. The difference will be that you will start the braid much higher on your hair, either at your front hairline or just behind your ear."

Every time you go to cross 1 of the high strands down into the middle of the trio, add a section of loose hair from the hair sweeping over your other shoulder before you move it to the middle. If you are starting the braid at your front hairline, pull sections forward from the back of your head. Work diagonally down and across to just behind the ear opposite your part. Be sure to add hair from directly above that section of braid so that your hair on the back of your head doesn’t cross all over itself and ruin the design. Keep the braid tight, and hold it close to the hairline. Keep the strands separated. [5] X Research source By the time the braid reaches the opposite side of your head, it should contain all your hair, not just the little section. If you are starting the French braid from the top of your head, you will begin by French braiding down, and then when you get around the earline, you will begin braiding in a horizontal line across your head. If your hair is super short, you can stop the side braid at your ear by fastening it with a pin or clip."
