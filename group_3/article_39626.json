      "content": "He’s trying to catch a glimpse of you, but subtly. If a guy’s into you, he’ll definitely try to have eyes on you when he can. This is in part because he wants to see what you’re up to, and in part because he likes the view! But if he’s playing it cool, he won’t want to be caught in the act. If you lock eyes with him, he’ll probably look away quickly. [1] X Research source Or, if he’s really crafty, you may not catch him in the act at all. Instead, ask your friends to keep an eye out when you’re in the room together. With their help, you might get all the intel you need."

      "content": "Humor is an attractive trait, and he definitely wants to seem attractive to you. If this guy is into you, he’ll want to impress you while he has the chance. So when you’re in a room together, he’ll be all about the jokes and quips, maybe even teasing his friends to get your attention. In his mind, this is a great way to show off in front of you without making it obvious that he’s into you—but luckily, you see right through it! [2] X Trustworthy Source HelpGuide Nonprofit organization dedicated to providing free, evidence-based mental health and wellness resources. Go to source Or, he might not make jokes, but still, his personality is bigger when you’re around. He might get loud, make the group’s plans, or challenge his friends. His friends might even comment on it—that’s how you know he’s pulling out all the stops for you!"

      "content": "Blushing, sweating and shaking are all signs of a major crush. Some guys are emboldened when they’re into you, but some lose their cool completely. If he’s trying not to make his feelings obvious, he might try to talk normally, give you minimal attention, or seem relaxed. But when you look closely, you’ll see signs that really, he’s on edge. Why? Because he really wants you to like him! [3] X Research source You might see him go red, nervously avoid your gaze, sweat, shake, twitch in his face or hands, or stutter while he talks to you. These are all signs that he’s nervous."

      "title": "He’s your knight in shining armor whenever you need his help.",
      "content": "He’s your knight in shining armor whenever you need his help. Even if it’s super inconvenient for him, he’s there when you need a friend. Maybe it’s to help you move, maybe it’s to search for something you lost, or maybe it’s even for emotional support. Regardless, he’s hoping that you’re noticing just how good of a “friend” he is, and that you’re starting to want him to be more… [4] X Research source This is an especially strong sign if he's not as generous with other people. If it seems like he brings out his best behavior just for you, he might be nursing a big crush."

      "title": "If he's crushing, he'll be thrilled when you two casually brush knees.",
      "content": "If he's crushing, he'll be thrilled when you two casually brush knees. When you’re together, he finds any opportunity to get close. He might do this without a word—sitting close on the couch, brushing shoulders with you, or touching your back while he passes at a party. On the other hand, he might come up with an excuse to touch you, either removing an eyelash from your face, comparing your hand size to his, or patting your knee when he asks you a question. [5] X Research source Though, if this guy leans in the nervous direction, there’s a chance that he won’t go this route. The idea of making his feelings too obvious through a casual touch will be too much for him, so he’ll hold back (but trust us, he’s thinking about it!)."

      "title": "His goal is to ensure that you two have more opportunities to hang out.",
      "content": "His goal is to ensure that you two have more opportunities to hang out. When you two spend time together, he’s thrilled, even if he doesn’t say so. How do you know? He works hard to keep the good times rolling. He might keep tacking on more activities when you guys hang out, or he might casually suggest that you two do something else later on in the week. For example, say you mention something you like—he might try to turn it into a reason to hang out: “Oh, you like Marvel movies? Me too. We’ve got to watch the new Ant-Man film as soon as it comes out.”"

    {
      "title": "It seems like even when you're not around, you're always on his mind.",
      "content": "It seems like even when you're not around, you're always on his mind. Your friends, his friends, and even strangers might be keen to mention that you’re all he talks about. He may not be letting on that he's into you when you're around, but for some reason, you're all he can think to talk about with other people. Why is that? Because when a guy's crushing on you, he'll think about you constantly. So when he's with pals, it's hard for him to remember stories that don't involve you. [6] X Research source “Ollie talks about you all the time. Today, he was joking about how you’re always late to everything.”"

      "content": "You’re not his , but sometimes he acts like you are. He doesn’t want people messing with you, he doesn’t want you getting into trouble…it’s almost like he really cares about you, but can’t seem to say it directly. He seems really invested in your well-being, even though you two aren’t particularly close. [7] X Research source “I really don’t think you should be flirting with Sal. He’s a player. You deserve someone who treats you really well.”"

      "title": "Being in your company is always the goal for him.",
      "content": "Being in your company is always the goal for him. If a guy likes you (but doesn’t want you to know yet), ideally he’ll want 1:1 time with you, but he won't want it to seem obvious. Because of this, he probably won’t come right out and ask you (“Should we go somewhere more private?”). Instead, he’ll jump on casual opportunities for you two to spend time alone. Say you’re driving to a concert with a group—he’d love to be in your Uber. Maybe you’re picking up breakfast for everyone—he wants to go too, so that he can look at the menu himself. When it comes to spending time with you, he’s an opportunist!"

      "title": "Even if he tries to be causal, he can’t help but to openly admire you.",
      "content": "Even if he tries to be causal, he can’t help but to openly admire you. When a guy likes you, naturally he’ll be thinking about all of the things that make you amazing. So he probably actively tries to keep himself from being too flattering, but with the number of sweet things he notices about you every day, some compliments are still destined to slip out! He might compliment your looks, personality, or deeper values. [8] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Business Review Online and print journal covering topics related to business management practices Go to source Bonus points if it’s an indirect compliment, because that means that he has a high opinion of you—but he had no intention of sharing that. For instance, say you’re making a trivia team. He might push to add you to the team because he obviously thinks you’re a smartie!"

    {
      "title": "Maybe he hasn’t asked you out, but he’s envious of guys who have.",
      "content": "Maybe he hasn’t asked you out, but he’s envious of guys who have. If this guy is trying to be casual about his crush, he’s unlikely to say that he’s jealous directly (“Wow, I wish I could go on a date with you…”). Instead, it’ll be subtle: he might look uncomfortable when you talk about Friday’s date, or he might leave the room when you say you think someone’s hot. He might also seem annoyed, even if he won’t admit that he’s jealous: [9] X Research source “This is a boring conversation. I don’t feel like sitting here listening to Hannah moon over some guy. Can we change the topic?”"

    {
      "title": "He wants to feel close to you, even if he can’t admit that yet.",
      "content": "He wants to feel close to you, even if he can’t admit that yet. It might seem like whenever you two are chatting, it gets deep—and fast. Why is this? Because he trusts you and feels a connection to you, even if he hasn’t let onto that just yet. He might talk about his fears, his relationship history, or his work; but if he seems set on bonding with you, that’s a good sign that he likes you (even if he’s playing it cool!). [10] X Research source This is especially true if he talks about what he wants in love. Not only is he trying to connect on a deeper level, but he’s also trying to subtly explain what he wants in a relationship (potentially because he’d love to have one with you!)."

    {
      "title": "When a guy likes you, he’ll probably notice the little things.",
      "content": "When a guy likes you, he’ll probably notice the little things. He remembered your birthday, even though it’d been forever since you talked about it. He could tell when you got a haircut, even though it was just a trim. He hasn’t said that he likes you yet, but it does seem like he pays special attention to you…and this is a great sign that he’s interested. You’re always on his mind, so he doesn’t miss a thing! [11] X Research source This might also lead him to comment on small, unique things that other people don’t notice. For example, he might look at you and say: “I feel like you’re always more energetic in the mornings. I love that. It’s so funny!”"
    },
    {
      "title": "He likes chatting with you too much to leave you on read.",
      "content": "He likes chatting with you too much to leave you on read. If a guy likes you (but he’s trying not to be obvious about it), his texts will be a strong tell. He might text you a lot and reply really quickly. Or, on the other hand, he might wait hours in response and just send you random, out-of-the-blue memes (so you don’t catch onto his crush!). But one thing’s for sure: he always responds. He can’t resist the chance to chat with you. If he’s inconsistent about how he texts you, that’s another good sign. This could mean that he’s going back and forth on how to handle his feelings for you."

      "content": "He wants to flirt with you, but he can’t be obvious (so he pokes fun! ). A lot of the time, teasing will be this guy's bread and butter. This is a way to make you laugh and subtly flirt, but without hinting at how he feels directly. With teasing, he can always claim that he’s just making fun of you because it’s funny (even though you know the real reason!). \"Drew, you are the loudest person I've ever met. I swear, I'm going to need to buy ear plugs before we hang out next time!\""

    {
      "title": "Maybe he’s too nervous to ask you out—so he has to be strategic.",
      "content": "Maybe he’s too nervous to ask you out—so he has to be strategic. Whenever he hears you’ll be somewhere, he’s keen to go, too. Somehow, it just seems like he wants to be at all the same events as you. This isn’t accidental: he’s never more motivated to be somewhere than when he knows that you’ll be in attendance! Haven’t noticed this specifically yet? Put it to the test! Next time you're in a group, announce that you might pop out for some reason, maybe to go get snacks for everyone. Ask who wants to join you on your trek. If he's down, that's a good sign!"

      "title": "It seems like to him, you’re the most exciting thing on the planet.",
      "content": "It seems like to him, you’re the most exciting thing on the planet. You might actually feel his vibe shift when you enter a room. Before, he was acting totally normal. Now, suddenly it’s like he’s walking on air. Everything that you say is met with a smile, so you feel like the coolest person ever. And to him, you probably are! If he does this, he’ll also probably laugh at whatever you say too. You’ll feel like a world-class comedian in this guy’s presence."

      "content": "When a guy likes you, you’ll notice that he can’t turn away. If he’s dead set on playing it cool, you might have to pay attention to subtler cues—like his body language. Here’s an expert tip for you: if a guy is paying special attention to you, you might find that he’s always turned towards you, even if the two of you aren’t speaking. He might also lean in when you speak. His feet are a telltale sign—look to see where his toes are pointed! If it's at you, that could mean that he has a crush. Some people report that when someone secretly likes you, they’ll look at you when they laugh. So next time you’re in a big group and someone cracks a joke, take a peek at him. If he’s beaming straight at you, that could be a good sign!"

    {
      "title": "If he's fidgeting, that could be a sign of nerves.",
      "content": "If he's fidgeting, that could be a sign of nerves. When a guy likes you, he’ll drop subtle cues subconsciously. He might rub his eyebrow, continually scratch his face, or put his hand to his mouth. All of these signals point in the same direction: he likes you! This is especially true if he keeps touching his lips. There’s a good chance that he’s thinking about kissing you, or about trying to get you to think about kissing him."
    },
    {
      "title": "If he’s struggling with his feelings, it might lead to strange behavior.",
      "content": "If he’s struggling with his feelings, it might lead to strange behavior. When a guy is being upfront about his feelings for you, it's usually easy to tell. When a guy just wants to be your friend, you might also pick up on that without any trouble. But when a guy is fighting feelings for you, he's probably just as confused as you are. He might find himself doing and saying things that he never thought he would, and you might end up feeling perplexed (What on earth is this guy thinking?\"). If you find that you're feeling totally lost about how he feels (whether platonic or romantic), that could be a sign that he's into you. If you ask your friends and they're also picking up on weird, unreadable vibes, you might be his secret crush!"
    },
    {
      "title": "If he’s hot and cold, it could be because he doesn’t know how to act.",
      "content": "If he’s hot and cold, it could be because he doesn’t know how to act. He’s caught between a rock and a hard place because as much as he likes you, he doesn’t want to show it. So this might lead to some really up and down behavior with you. Like one day, all he wants is to talk to you—and the next, he’s totally aloof. Why is this? Because he has no idea what he’s doing; when it comes to you, he feels out of his element! Pro tip: if you want confirmation, try asking him about how hot and cold he runs with you. If he gets nervous when you ask or tries to change the subject immediately, that’s a good sign that he’s into you. Be aware that this type of inconsistent behavior could stem from a man being married or otherwise committed to someone else. In this case, it's best to walk away from the situation. Reader Poll: We asked 1657 wikiHow readers and 51% of them agreed that the best way to handle a married man being interested in you is by distancing yourself from him . [Take Poll]"

Maybe you two joke about being the single friends, or maybe you laugh about how all of your friends want you to get together. But if you guys have a little ongoing joke about what you are to each other (and he’s the one keeping it going), it might be because he actually thinks a lot about that. It might be a joke now, but down the line, he might hope it becomes a real discussion. He might also refer to you guys as an “old married couple,” because you’re so close, and you jokingly bicker. Or, he might joke that you two are each other's wingmen (even though in reality, you're the only person he wants to impress!)."
