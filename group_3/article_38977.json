      "content": "Turn the dial to set the current time. Mechanical timers need to be set to the current time so they can run accurately on their programs. Turn the dial on your boiler clockwise until the arrow on the dial points to the correct time. If you need change the time to earlier in the day, keep spinning the dial clockwise to make a full rotation. [1] X Research source Many mechanical timers have a 24-hour clock. Make sure the dial is turned to the right time if it’s in the morning or afternoon. Some mechanical timers have a larger clock face on the front of the dial so it’s easier to see the time."

      "title": "Choose when you want your boiler on by changing the pins around the dial.",
      "content": "Choose when you want your boiler on by changing the pins around the dial. The pins around the dial each turn your boiler on or off for 15 minutes at a time. Look on the dial to find the time you want your boiler to start and change the pin to the “On” position. Turn on the rest of the pins for the duration you want your boiler to run. Leave the pins alone if you don’t want the boiler on during that time. [2] X Research source For example, if you want your boiler to turn on from 7-8 AM, then set the 4 pins between 7 and 8 to the “On” position. Some programmers may have you move the pin away from the center of the dial while others will make you push the pin toward the center. Look at the owner’s manual to confirm which way to move your pins. You can choose to set your boiler to turn on and off multiple times throughout the day. Set your boiler to turn on 30 minutes earlier than when you want hot water since it usually takes that amount of time to heat up your home entirely."

Look for the option on the switch that’s labeled “Timer” or has a small clock icon next to it. Change the switch to the “Timer” option so your boiler runs during the times you selected. [3] X Research source You can always choose to turn your boiler on or off to ignore the scheduled time."

Use the arrow buttons on the programmer to cycle through the days of the week before pressing the “Select” button. Then use the arrows to change the hours and minutes display on the clock. When you’re finished, press the “Set Time” button again to confirm the time. [4] X Research source Each programmer has different settings, so consult the owner’s manual to find specific directions for your model. Make sure you set the time to AM or PM so your boiler activates at the right time."

Once the time is set, press the “Set” or “Program” button on the programmer to activate the scheduling feature. The numbers on the screen should be flashing after you press the button.

Hold the button down to cycle through the time faster. When the right time is selected, press the “Select” or “Enter” button to confirm the time. [7] X Research source Set the time for 30 minutes ahead of when you want hot water so the boiler has time to completely heat up when you need to use it.
