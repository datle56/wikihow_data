Talk about nasty, right?” Example: “I’m not ready for my birthday. It’s my nasty 19, which means it’s gonna be a tough one. I wish I could be with my family instead of away at school.”"

If you’re uncertain of the future, life & recovery coach Kamila Tan says to “get curious about the unknown instead of fearing it.” Think about some exciting new things on the horizon and focus on the good in your life, as the worst-case scenarios you fear typically don’t come to fruition. Think about milestones that are coming up in your life, like your 21st birthday, your first adult job, or your college graduation if you’re enrolled at university.
