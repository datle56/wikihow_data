      "content": "Place the senet board in between the players. A senet board has 3 rows and 10 columns that make 30 spaces, or houses . Set the game board in the middle of the table so both of the players can easily reach it. You can play Senet with 2 players. If you don’t have a senet board, then just draw your own! Split a piece of paper into 3 rows and 10 columns so there are 30 total spaces. Number the top row 1-10 going left to right. Number the second row 11-20 going from right to left . Number the bottom row 21-30 going left to right again."

      "content": "Color one side of 4 popsicle sticks to make the senet sticks. Instead of dice, Senet traditionally uses 4 sticks (or “fingers”) that are colored on one side and blank on the other. Use a marker to color in 1 side of each stick. If you don’t want to make senet sticks, just use a 6-sided die instead. Because the most you can move on your turn is 5 spaces, just reroll the die whenever you get a 6."

      "content": "Alternate placing the player pieces on the top row of the board. Give each player 5 pieces to use for the game. One player places their pieces on houses 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9. The other player puts their pieces on houses 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10. [1] X Research source If you don’t have any game pieces, find 5 small objects for each player. Make sure each player has different colored pieces. Some good options are dimes and pennies or checkers."

      "content": "Throw the sticks up and check how many land on their blank sides. Choose a player to take their first turn. When it’s your turn, take all 4 sticks and toss them into the air. When they land, the number of spaces you can move depends on how many blank sides are showing: 1 blank stick: move 1 space 2 blank sticks: move 2 spaces 3 blank sticks: move 3 spaces 4 blank sticks: move 4 spaces 0 blank sticks: move 5 spaces"

      "content": "Move one of your pieces along the board. You can choose any of your pieces to move on your turn. Pick the piece up off of the board and move it forward following the numbers on the board. Only 1 piece can be in each house, and you cannot have 2 of your pieces in the same space. You can jump over other pieces, but 3 or more of your opponent’s pieces in a consecutive row create a blockade that you cannot move through. If you moved 1, 4, or 5 spaces, then take another turn. Otherwise, your opponent takes their turn. If you’re not able to move any of your pieces, then you forfeit your turn."

Then, place your opponent’s piece on the square where your piece originally started.

The names of the spaces and what they mean are: Square 15 (House of Second Life): Move your piece back to square 1 on the board if you land here directly. Square 26 (House of Beauty): A piece must land on this square before you can move it any further on the board. Square 27 (House of Waters): End your turn when you land on this space. On your next turn, you must use the same piece. Choose to move back to the 15 spot, or try throwing the sticks to get 4 blanks. If you throw any other number, then your turn ends. Square 28 (House of Three Judges): You cannot move from this space unless you throw exactly 3 blank sticks. Square 29 (House of Two Judges): You cannot move from this space unless you throw exactly 2 blank sticks. Square 30 (House of Horus): Remove your token from the board if you throw 1 or more blank sticks."

If you’re able to, keep groups of your pieces together so they can’t get captured. Remember that 3 of your pieces next to each other prevent your opponent from jumping over them. Try to form a blockade near the top or middle of the board to trap your opponent’s pieces."

      "content": "Look for moves to swap places with your opponent. You get to choose which piece you move each turn, so always look for a place where you can capture another piece. This sends your opponent backwards so they have to catch back up to you. Try to capture a piece that’s between 2 of your other pieces. That way, you immediately form a blockade and trap the piece you just captured behind it."

While it seems that it started as fun game to pass the time, by 1,550 BC it became a religious symbol that even appeared in the Book of the Dead. [4] X Research source Some researchers believe the game pieces represent souls journeying through the afterlife and finally reaching it when they’re removed from the board. Senet became so popular in ancient Egypt that a board was even found in King Tut’s tomb. [5] X Research source"

No records of senet’s original rules have been discovered, so the way it’s played now is probably a bit different from how the ancient Egyptians did. Scientists have found some ancient texts referring to the game and have made their best guesses on the rules, but the actual gameplay is still a mystery. [6] X Research source"
