      "content": "Consider whether you're bored in all classes, or just some. Perhaps there is an issue of you not liking some classes but loving others. This can result in feeling bored during the dull classes but feeling energized when you're interested in the topic. Is the subject matter too hard? Sometimes boredom is a way of deflecting the need to work harder or to ask for help. Is the subject matter too easy? If you feel that you've been there, done that and want to be challenged a lot more, you will get bored really easily. Is the class using a teaching method you find uninspiring? For example, the use of worksheets all the time can lead to boredom because nothing else is used to mix up the variety."

      "title": "Ask for help.",
      "content": "Ask for help. If your boredom is a result of not understanding the class materials, seek help. The whole point of education is to learn, not to behave as if you know what you're doing when you don't. If you ask for help, teachers view you as motivated and willing to learn, not as stupid. You might also ask your parents about getting a tutor, if the gaps in your knowledge are quite large. A tutor involves one-on-one learning and most of the time, you'll find this results in much faster learning and easier understanding, allowing you to catch up quickly. If any teacher implies that you're stupid, then it's time to see someone about the teacher's approach to teaching, not see this as a reflection on you. Any person who has the sense to ask for help deserves to be helped. Obviously, you should only ask your teacher for help with schoolwork after you try solving it on your own. Study more effectively. There are plenty of online guides for improving your study methods so that you understand the subject matter better and know how to improve your scores. [4] X Research source"

For example, if all you get is worksheets all the time, ask your teacher if it is possible to learn in other ways, such as through reading as a class, watching videos, doing experiments or visiting places, etc. It might be that your teacher hasn't realized that there is an overload of one style of presenting the material to you as a class, and simply drawing attention to how it's not working might result in a change for the better."
