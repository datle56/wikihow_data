      "title": "Ask your stylist for a fade on the bottom and straight-cut hair on top.",
      "content": "Ask your stylist for a fade on the bottom and straight-cut hair on top. Opt for a #2 guard on the razor for a closer fade on the lowest layers or a #3 guard to leave approximately 3 ⁄ 8 in (0.95 cm) of length. Next, direct your stylist to add multiple short layers on top to add more dimension or cut them all to the same length to create a more prominent “mushroom cap.” You can also ask them to cut a fringe or taper the side pieces to hang slightly longer in the front or back. [6] X Research source If there’s a particular celebrity, TikTok creator, or model whose mushroom cut you admire, download a picture or video of them to your mobile phone and send it to your stylist ahead of your appointment. That way, both you and your stylist will have a reference to guide you. Play with the versatility of the mushroom cut. For example, if you want long side pieces, ask the stylist to taper the top layers downward, so each side ends naturally at your cheek or jaw. You can also go short or long, fringe or no fringe – it's up to you how you want to customize it. Ask for touch-ups to make the mushroom perfect. For example, if you notice one side looks too long or you don’t like the shape, let your stylist know."
