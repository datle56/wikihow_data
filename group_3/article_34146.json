      "content": "Get vaccinated if a vaccine is available to you. Several different vaccines have been approved for emergency use in the US and around the world. Whether you are eligible to receive the vaccine depends on the specific regulations in your area, but generally, healthcare workers, residents of long-term care facilities, essential workers and people with medical conditions that put them at higher risk will receive the vaccine first. Three vaccines have been approved for emergency use in the US. These are made by Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, and Johnson & Johnson. You are unlikely to be able to choose which vaccine you will receive when you get an appointment because supplies are limited. However, each vaccine has shown excellent protection against COVID-19 in trials and greatly reduces your chances of severe disease and being hospitalized."

      "content": "Stay away from people who are coughing or sneezing. Since COVID-19 is a respiratory infection, coughing and sneezing are common symptoms. Additionally, coughing and sneezing both release the virus into the air, so they may increase your risk of infection. Keep your distance from people who appear to have symptoms of an upper respiratory infection. [2] X Trustworthy Source World Health Organization Health information and news provided by the World Health Organization Go to source If it’s appropriate, ask the person to stay away from you. You could say, “I noticed you were coughing. I hope you feel better soon, but please keep your distance from me so I don’t get sick.” If you know someone that has been around sick people, it’s a good idea to distance yourself from them, too. You never know if that person got sick."

      "content": "Wash your hands with soap and water to minimize your infection risk. The best way to prevent COVID-19 is to wash your hands as often as possible. Wet your hands with warm water, then apply a mild soap. Work the soap into a lather for 20-30 seconds, then rinse your hands clean under warm running water. This is about how long it takes to sing the \"Happy Birthday\" song to yourself twice, so pretend you're celebrating someone's birthday. [3] X Trustworthy Source MedlinePlus Collection of medical information sourced from the US National Library of Medicine Go to source The World Health Organization recommends not just rubbing your hands palm to palm, but interlacing and interlocking your fingers in a variety of different ways to make sure every surface is clean. Use the paper towel you dry your hands off with to turn off the faucet. Always wash your hands before you eat or drink anything. However, it’s also best to wash your hands anytime you’re out in public or after you’re around someone you suspect may be sick. If you can't wash your hands, use a hand sanitizer that contains 60-95% alcohol. Alcohol percentages higher than 95% are actually less effective.

Use a spray disinfectant or bleach wipes to clean these surfaces daily. Make sure the surface stays wet for about 10 minutes so it effectively kills the virus. This limits the risk of the virus lingering on the surfaces and potentially causing an infection. [6] X Trustworthy Source Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Main public health institute for the US, run by the Dept. of Health and Human Services Go to source In your home, disinfect your front doorknob, kitchen counters, bathroom counters, and faucets.

      "content": "Stay home as much as possible to distance yourself from other people. You’ve probably heard about “social distancing” or \"physical distancing\" which can help limit the spread of the virus. To practice social distancing, only leave your home for necessities, like restocking groceries or going to work. If you can, work or do your schoolwork at home, as well. Don’t go out to eat, hang out in bars, or participate in recreational activities, like going to the movies. By social distancing, you reduce the likelihood you’ll come into contact with the virus. If everyone does this, the virus won’t spread as easily. If you’re in a high-risk group for complications, it’s very important to stay in your home as often as possible. You’re considered high-risk if you’re 65 or older, have a compromised immune system, or have a health condition like heart disease or asthma. If you have been fully vaccinated you may be able to relax social distancing in certain ways according to the CDC, such as gathering indoors without masks with other fully vaccinated individuals."

You may decide to still see family or friends, but realize there is still a risk of transmitting the virus. Even people not in high-risk groups can still contract the virus and spread it to others or fall ill themselves. Different regions have different recommendations or laws about what size gatherings are allowed, so check with your local government or health authority to be sure. Following local guidelines can help limit the spread of the virus, especially if you allow each other personal space. This includes gatherings at your home or outdoors where others aren't around. Don't meet up with friends or family at a public place. It's best to have a meeting on an online platform instead."

In general, keep a 6 ft (1.8 m) circle of personal space around you. If someone is getting too close to you, move away and kindly remind them that the CDC recommends maintaining a 6 ft (1.8 m) gap.
