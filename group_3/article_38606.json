      "content": "Choose an area that you want to select with your Lasso Tool. Your selection can include one object or portions of objects. Once you draw a complete circle around this area, you can make changes to the vector graphics anchor points that were selected. Encase the area you want to select in the Lasso Tool so all anchor points within that area are selected. Since Illustrator is a vector graphics editor rather than a bitmap editor, the Lasso Tool will select anchor points on the image, instead of the edges of the whole image itself. You can use these anchor points to move or edit your selection. Press the Shift key while clicking areas that are selected that you want to exclude from the selection."

If you want to select similar items that are spread over an area, like red confetti, you can select one with the default Selection tool then go to the Selection tab at the top of your screen and select Same > Fill Color (if they are all red). You can also designate if you want to select everything with the same appearance, blending mode, fill & stroke, opacity, stroke color, stroke weight, and shape."
