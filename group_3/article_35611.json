[2] X Research source Don't try to squeeze the stinger out. Always use tweezers or scrape out the stinger.

      "content": "Wash the bite immediately with soap and water to keep it clean. There’s a good chance that the bug that bit you was carrying unwanted bacteria or debris on its body.

[4] X Research source You only need to do this once as part of your first aid response to your bug bite, although you should do it right away. You may also apply an antibiotic cream to the bite to make sure you’re keeping it as clean as possible."

Repeat this process as necessary every 1-2 hours to reduce swelling while also numbing any pain being caused by the bite. [5] X Research source Refrain from putting ice directly on your skin or leaving the cool compress on for too long, as this can cause tissue damage. Make sure you always wrap ice in a towel or cloth before using it as a compress. You can also press the back of a cold spoon on your bug bite to act as a cold compress. Just make sure you leave the spoon in the freezer for a few minutes first to make it cold!"
