      "content": "Fill a container with hot soapy water. Get a container big enough to submerge all the rocks you want to clean in. Put in a few drops of dish detergent in the hot water. [1] X Research source Any mild dish detergent or other mild liquid soap will work fine to clean the rocks off."

      "content": "Place the rocks you want to polish in the container and let them soak. Make sure the rocks are fully submerged. Let them sit for a few minutes to loosen up the dirt before you scrub them clean. [2] X Research source You can stir the rocks around gently with your hands to help loosen the dirt even more."

      "title": "Use a toothbrush to scrub dirt off of the rocks.",
      "content": "Use a toothbrush to scrub dirt off of the rocks. Get into all the cracks and crevices with the bristles of the brush. Rinse the rocks off in the soapy water as you go until you have removed as much dirt as you can. [3] X Research source You can use any other kind of bristled brush, or even a scouring pad, if you don't have an old toothbrush to use."

      "title": "Pat the rocks dry with a towel and let them air dry completely.",
      "content": "Pat the rocks dry with a towel and let them air dry completely. Dry off the rocks with a clean towel as much as you can. Let them sit out in the open, on the towel or on a rack, to air dry completely. [4] X Research source Once the rocks dry, you can see if you missed any dirty spots and give them a second scrub if needed."

      "title": "Place a rock in a vice clamp to secure it for grinding.",
      "content": "Place a rock in a vice clamp to secure it for grinding. Attach a vice clamp to a flat work surface. Put a rock you want to polish in it with the largest area exposed to start sanding there. You can get small clamp-on vices that you can attach to any kind of flat surface at a home improvement store or online. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Put on a face mask, protective glasses, and gloves.",
      "content": "Put on a face mask, protective glasses, and gloves. Use this protective gear to keep you from breathing in rock dust or getting an injury. Rock dust is very harmful if breathed in, and one slip with the Dremel tool could cause injury to your fingers. [6] X Research source You can find all the necessary protective gear at a home improvement store."

    {
      "title": "Grind the whole rock with low-grit sandpaper and a Dremel sanding attachment.",
      "content": "Grind the whole rock with low-grit sandpaper and a Dremel sanding attachment. Change the bit on your Dremel tool to a sanding attachment and slide a low-grit, like 600-grit, sandpaper band on it. Grind the first exposed surface of the rock, then rotate it in the vice clamp to expose another side and grind that surface. [7] X Research source Keep rotating the rock and grinding each new exposed surface until you have gone over it all. This first round of sanding doesn't need to be perfect. You will perfect the finish with increasingly fine sanding attachments."

    {
      "title": "Switch to a medium-grit sanding band and grind the whole rock again.",
      "content": "Switch to a medium-grit sanding band and grind the whole rock again. Change the sanding band on the Dremel to a medium-grit, such as 800-grit, sanding band. Repeat the process of rotating the rock around in the vice to expose each surface and grind it all over. [8] X Research source Pay attention to areas with sharp edges or crevices. Spend extra time sanding these areas down before you move on to fine-grit sandpaper. Angle the bit as flat to the surface of the rock as possible to grind down these parts evenly."

      "title": "Grind the whole rock a last time with fine-grit sandpaper until it starts to shine.",
      "content": "Grind the whole rock a last time with fine-grit sandpaper until it starts to shine. Change the sandpaper on the Dremel tool to a 1000- or 1200-grit sandpaper. Sand all over the rock until it has a completely smooth finish and starts to look shiny. [9] X Research source Use just the tip of the grinding bit to give the rock a really smooth final finish."

      "title": "Switch the Dremel bit to a polishing wheel.",
      "content": "Switch the Dremel bit to a polishing wheel. Choose a polishing wheel that is small enough to reach all areas of the rock you are polishing. Take out the sanding attachment from your Dremel tool and replace it with the polishing wheel. [10] X Research source Polishing wheel attachments are soft, felt bits that are used to buff different materials and make them shiny. You can get different Dremel bits at a tool store, home improvement center, or online."

    {
      "title": "Dip the polishing wheel in rock polishing compound.",
      "content": "Dip the polishing wheel in rock polishing compound. Turn the Dremel on and dip it gently into some rock polishing compound. Remove it after a few seconds when you have coated the wheel with the polish. [11] X Research source You can get rock polishing compound online or in a specialty rock shop if there is one in your area."

    {
      "title": "Buff the compound into each surface of the rock until it is shiny.",
      "content": "Buff the compound into each surface of the rock until it is shiny. Keep the rock in the vice and buff the polish into one exposed surface at a time with the polishing wheel. Rotate the rock when you have made the exposed surface you are working on shiny and work on the next area. [12] X Research source You should notice the rock starting to reveal its natural luster after a few minutes of buffing. Keep going until you achieve the look you want. You can give the rock a final polish by hand with a piece of fabric like denim."
