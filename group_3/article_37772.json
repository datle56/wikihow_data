I lean into the rhythm of your heart to see where it will take us. We gallop into a warm, southern wind. I link my legs to yours and we ride together, Toward the ancient encampment of our relatives. Where have you been? they ask. And what has taken you so long? at night after eating, singing, and dancing We lay together under the stars. We know ourselves to be part of mystery. It is unspeakable. It is everlasting. It is for keeps. [7] X Research source"

One shade the more, one ray the less, Had half impair’d the nameless grace Which waves in every raven tress, Or softly lightens o’er her face; Where thoughts serenely sweet express How pure, how dear their dwelling-place. And on that cheek, and o’er that brow, So soft, so calm, yet eloquent, The smiles that win, the tints that glow, But tell of days in goodness spent, A mind at peace with all below, A heart whose love is innocent!

I love you without knowing how, or when, or from where, I love you directly without problems or pride: I love you like this because I don’t know any other way to love, except in this form in which I am not nor are you, so close that your hand upon my chest is mine, so close that your eyes close with my dreams.

I recognize your voice, your sounds, though if I knew no better, I could be any man in any room. After, the rising sounds of rising and of dressing and once as you step up close to the deck perhaps to pick up shoes, you sing the chorus of Sunday Morning. I call on you to hurry and we leave. It does not end then; the tape rolls on. A few late cars which sigh by might have passed us walking away triumphant, unaware we’ve left behind this mop and mow mechanism of silence to which we may never return. [20] X Research source"

But if you love and must needs have desires, let these be your desires: To melt and be like a running brook that sings its melody to the night. To know the pain of too much tenderness. To be wounded by your own understanding of love; And to bleed willingly and joyfully. To wake at dawn with a winged heart and give thanks for another day of loving; To rest at the noon hour and meditate love’s ecstasy; To return home at eventide with gratitude; And then to sleep with a prayer for the beloved in your heart and a song of praise upon your lips.

I sent thee late a rosy wreath, Not so much honoring thee As giving it a hope that there It could not withered be; But thou thereon didst only breathe, And sent’st it back to me; Since when it grows, and smells, I swear, Not of itself, but thee.

Lawrence Love has crept into her sealed heart As a field bee, black and amber, Breaks from the winter-cell, to clamber Up the warm grass where the sunbeams start. Love has crept into her summery eyes, And a glint of colored sunshine brings Such as his along the folded wings Of the bee before he flies. But I with my ruffling, impatient breath Have loosened the wings of the wild young sprite; He has opened them out in a reeling flight, And down her words he hasteneth. Love flies delighted in her voice: The hum of his glittering, drunken wings Sets quivering with music the little things That she says, and her simple words rejoice. [24] X Research source"

Which owes the other most? my love was long, And yours one moment seemed to wax more strong; I loved and guessed at you, you construed me And loved me for what might or might not be – Nay, weights and measures do us both a wrong. For verily love knows not ‘mine’ or ‘thine;’ With separate ‘I’ and ‘thou’ free love has done, For one is both and both are one in love: Rich love knows nought of ‘thine that is not mine;’ Both have the strength and both the length thereof, Both of us, of the love which makes us one.

It’s noon, and tired I look into the rest of the awake day incapable of even awe, just a presence of particle and wave, just that closed and deliberate human observance. Your thin fingers and the dissolution of all ability. Lay open now to only me that white body, and I will, as the awkward butterfly, land quietly upon you. A grace and staying. A sight and ease. A spell entangled. A span. I am inside you. And so both projected, we are now part of a garden, that is part of a landscape, that is part of a world that no one believes in. [28] X Research source"

Love's not Time's fool, though rosy lips and cheeks Within his bending sickle's compass come: Love alters not with his brief hours and weeks, But bears it out even to the edge of doom. If this be error and upon me proved, I never writ, nor no man ever loved. [35] X Research source"

      "content": "“A Red, Red Rose” by Robert Burns O my Luve is like a red, red rose That’s newly sprung in June; O my Luve is like the melody That’s sweetly played in tune. So fair art thou, my bonnie lass, So deep in luve am I; And I will luve thee still, my dear, Till a’ the seas gang dry. Till a’ the seas gang dry, my dear, And the rocks melt wi’ the sun; I will love thee still, my dear, While the sands o’ life shall run. And fare thee weel, my only luve! And fare thee weel awhile! And I will come again, my luve, Though it were ten thousand mile. [42] X Research source"

      "content": "“Dear One Absent This Long While” by Lisa Olstein It has been so wet stones glaze in moss; everything blooms coldly. I expect you. I thought one night it was you at the base of the drive, you at the foot of the stairs, you in a shiver of light, but each time leaves in wind revealed themselves, the retreating shadow of a fox, daybreak. We expect you, cat and I, bluebirds and I, the stove. In May we dreamed of wreaths burning on bonfires over which young men and women leapt. June efforts quietly. I’ve planted vegetables along each garden wall so even if spring continues to disappoint we can say at least the lettuce loved the rain. I have new gloves and a new hoe. I practice eulogies. He was a hawk with white feathered legs. She had the quiet ribs of a salamander crossing the old pony post road. Yours is the name the leaves chatter at the edge of the unrabbited woods.

If you’re writing this poem for a significant other, then you want to start by picturing this person in your mind. Consider what feelings their image brings up for you and how you want to show love through your poem. If helpful, draw a mind map or jot down some ideas that arise as you think of this person. What color do you see around them? What smells or sensations do they make you think of? What feelings do they inspire in you? These initial images can help you to create a foundation for your poem.

      "content": "Choose a poetic form to write in and decide on a rhyme scheme or rhythm. “There are numerous ways to format poems,” says Cook. “There’s no black-and-white way that you must format your poem, so that’s really up to you as the creator. You could do the standard metered and rhymed poetry. There are haikus. You can do freeform or free verse poetry. Right now, in contemporary poetry, free-form and free verse seem to be the most popular. They don’t need to rhyme, but they can rhyme.” In her poetry, Cook uses “random rhythm, regular rhythm, alternating rhythm, flowing rhythm, or progressive rhythm…Rhythm is closely associated with meter, which identifies units of stressed and unstressed syllables. So the reader is reading it in that rhythm almost subconsciously…Within that [rhythm] is how you shape your rhymes.” “I use internal rhymes sometimes,” continues Cook. “Not all rhyming poetry needs to end on a rhyme. The rhymes can be internal, meaning they can be in the middle of poems as well.”"

      "content": "Carefully select your words, including imagery and symbolism. When it comes to writing the actual content of the poem, it’s important to intentionally use words with meaning and purpose. Some of the most romantic (and tear-jerking) love poems use heightened language (like hyperbole and exaggerated statements) to convey the heightened emotions that come out of love. You can also choose to include words and phrases that evoke a specific image or symbol. For instance, Shakespeare’s famous Sonnet 18 employs a simile when comparing the subject of the poem to “a summer’s day.” [46] X Research source If you’re struggling to come up with good imagery, go back to your initial brainstorm. Tap into each of your five senses. When you think of your love, what do you see, smell, hear, taste, or feel? Most of all, however, be authentic with your word choice. If you’re not someone who would use overly-flowery or academic language in real life, don’t use it in your poem. Your wife or girlfriend will be much more moved by a poem that sounds like the voice of the person they love…which is you!"

      "content": "Title your poem appropriately. Give your poem a one-line title that sums up the main message of the text. You could also choose your favorite line or word in the poem and use that as the title. “If you’re really stuck on naming a poem,” advises Cook, “show the poem to a trusted colleague or friend and say, ‘What pops out at you with that poem?’ And they might insert their own experience, but it tells us of a different point of view that might make a title click.” Cook also mentions that she likes to “title poems in a way that adds another line to the poem. So [her] titles are usually one word or two, but sometimes they could be longer and actually take the poem in itself to a whole other level.”"

      "content": "Sending a love poem allows you to express deep emotions in a unique and special way. Poetry is one of the oldest and most romantic art forms, and it’s able to convey feelings and emotions that we might not be able to express in other ways. Whether you write your own love poem or choose a well-known one to send to the special lady in your life, that gesture will show her that you appreciate her, are thinking of her, and feel a depth of love for her that can’t be stated in simple, everyday words. [47] X Research source Sharing poetry can also strengthen the intimate connection between two people, revealing a newfound vulnerability and allowing for a shared experience of emotion and love."
