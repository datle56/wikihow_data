In Acts 2:4 The disciples received power when they received the Holy Spirit; they also spoke in tongues. In Acts 2:38 Peter tells us how to receive power by telling us how to receive the Holy Spirit."

And I pray that you and all God’s holy people will have the power to understand the greatness of Christ’s love—how wide, how long, how high, and how deep that love is.

With God’s power working in us, he can do much, much more than anything we can ask or think of. Ephesians 3:18-20"

This power is not power or authority over other people.(see Matthew 20:25-28 ) The power is always to promote and glorify Jesus name, never for personal glory.( John 7:18, 2 Corinthians 10:17-18 ) Neither does it make the person more important than other people Jesus said \"he who humbles Himself shall be exalted\".( Luke 14:11 ) Receiving power is not an excuse to do wrong rather it gives us strength to do right \"I can do all things through Christ who strengthens (empowers) me\".( Philippians 4:13 )(see also Philippians 4:8 ) If you want to reflect on who you are and what you want, think about the last year (or a month or five months). [1] X Research source Ask yourself what you were proud of or what you would have done differently. Ask yourself what kinds of people, activities, and work were life-giving and what kinds of people, activities, and work were life-draining. [2] X Research source Another exercise you can do is to imagine yourself 30 years from now and imagine what you would be saying to yourself at that time. What would you like to say about your life up to this point?"
