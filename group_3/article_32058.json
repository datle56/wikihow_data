      "content": "Put your wallet into the large, main compartment of your purse. Your wallet should fit nicely in the large pocket of most purses, making it easy to grab whenever you need it. Keep it stocked with your ID or driver’s license, any credit cards or gift cards, and at least $20 in cash. You can also try carrying your cards and ID on the back of your phone case, and using a smaller coin purse for cash and coins."

      "content": "Put together a small toiletry kit of items like pads, tampons, and tissues. Grab a cute toiletry kit online or from a store and fill it with emergency toiletry items that you don’t want to be caught without.

      "content": "Fill a small makeup bag with lotion, lip balm, and any cosmetics. If you wear makeup, it’s always a good idea to carry a few items around with you in case you need to touch up during the day. If you only need a few small things, like mascara or lip balm, you can put them in your toiletry kit; otherwise, set aside a separate bag for cosmetics to stay organized."

      "content": "Set your keys in a small, secure side pocket. Even a big key ring can get lost inside your purse! To avoid needing to fish around for it all the time, slip your keys into a small, secure pocket in or on the side of your bag. You can also put a keychain or two on the ring to make it easier to find. [2] X Research source If you put your keys in an outer side pocket, make sure it zips up so the keys don’t slip out or get stolen."

      "title": "Put your phone in a smaller section where it won’t get lost.",
      "content": "Put your phone in a smaller section where it won’t get lost. In a small bag, your phone might fit nicely in the main compartment with your wallet. If your bag is medium-sized or a larger tote, though, you may want to fit it into a smaller compartment where you can find it more easily. No matter where you put your phone, make sure it’s easily accessible when you get a call or text. [3] X Research source If you like to carry earbuds around with your phone, disconnect them, wind them together, and clip them up with a binder clip so they don’t get tangled."

      "content": "Pack gum or mints to keep your breath fresh. Having a small pack of mints or gum on hand can help you maintain that clean, just-brushed feeling all day long. Pop in a mint or a piece of gum after a meal or whenever you want to get a taste out of your mouth. [4] X Research source Most schools don’t allow gum, so pack mints if you’re taking your purse to class. Go for minty flavors for the freshest feel."

      "content": "Keep your sunglasses in a case in the main portion of your bag. Sunglasses can get banged up or scratched in your purse, but you’ll definitely want to have them around to deal with bright sunlight. Protect them by slipping them into a case and placing them neatly in the main portion of your bag. You should also use a case for any eyeglasses you might use."

      "content": "Bring snacks like granola bars if you know you’ll be away from home for a while. It’s never a bad idea to pack a couple grab-and-go snacks to keep you going throughout the day! Go for small, packaged options like granola bars or packets of nuts or pretzels. You can also pack your own snacks in a Ziploc bag, but make sure to close it tightly so it doesn’t pop open in your purse. Crumbs can accumulate fast in a purse, so make sure to throw out your food trash as soon as you can."

If your bag is big enough, having a couple items to keep yourself busy is a great option, just in case you find yourself waiting somewhere with nothing to do! Pack a small book, a notebook and pen, or even a small tablet in the main compartment of your bag to banish boredom. If your bag isn’t big enough, don’t worry. Just make sure you have a couple fun games or good books loaded on your phone at all times."

      "content": "Keep a few safety items in easily accessible places. Your purse is a useful place to self-defense items that can help keep you safe and feeling empowered. You can stash a can of pepper spray, an emergency whistle, or even a personal safety alarm that lets off a siren when you use it. Make sure to keep these items in safe but easy to reach pockets, like a concealed, zippered pocket. Take the time to learn how to use the items before you start carrying them around. Some places have restrictions on safety items like pepper spray, limiting the size of the cans you can carry. Check the rules in your area before you buy!"

They’re great for storing smaller, easy-to-lose items that are too important not to pack in your purse, like toiletries, makeup, or pens.

      "content": "Put trash items in a small Ziploc and empty it every day. Even the most organized purse accumulates trash from time to time! To keep wrappers and receipts from dirtying up your main compartment, designate a small Ziploc as your “trash bag.” Fill it up throughout the day and toss the items into the garbage when you get home. You can also use a small prescription pill bottle to hold trash. Reuse your trash baggie as long as you can, until it gets dirty."

      "content": "Use a removable purse organizer if you like to switch bags. A purse organizer is basically a small bag-within-a-bag, complete with helpful compartments, that you slide into your larger bag. It’s a great tool for bags that don’t have their own divided sections, and can also make it easy to switch bags if you like to rotate between a few. Grab an organizer online or from a department store. Take care of your organizer just as you would your normal purse! Keep it as neat as you can and designate sections to important items to stay organized."

      "content": "Use the smallest size purse you can so it’s easy to carry around and keep neat. You can use whatever size of bag you want, but larger bags do tend to accumulate more clutter than smaller ones. Prioritize the things you really need to carry around with you all the time and leave some of the less necessary items at home when you can. You can also switch between bags when you need to. A small or medium-sized purse might be good for everyday use, but you may want a bigger tote for some special occasions, like a beach trip."
