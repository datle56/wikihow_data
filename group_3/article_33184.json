      "content": "Let him see you enjoying your singledom. That's right. You have to own b eing a single lady while letting the guy see you in action. Being single is fun: you can meet a lot of new people, have a blast with your girlfriends, and go out without knowing what the night has in store for you. Let the guy see you laughing, dancing, and loving the single life, instead of looking around desperately, or being upset about not having a special someone. [2] X Research source If a guy sees you having fun living the single life, he'll want to be a part of your life even more. You should enjoy the time you spend being single. You won't have it forever."

If he thinks you're an ice queen who doesn't want a moment of his time, then he'll quickly lose interest. So, flirt with him a little bit when you see him, but don't carry on too long. Just make eye contact, smile , and exchange a few playful words before you say you have to get going. Don't be rude; just don't be too enthusiastic, either. [3] X Research source Play with your hair while you talk to him. Laugh and look at the floor; let him see you blush just a bit. If you know each other well enough, you can give him a playful shove or a tap on the arm, that's really playing hard to get."

      "content": "Flirt with other guys. If you want to play hard to get, then the guy can't think that he's the only person on your radar. You should flirt with a few other guys without taking advantage of them or being too obvious about it; let him see that you're desirable and that other guys want you, too. This doesn't mean you should do anything untoward or anything that makes you look promiscuous; just let him see that you're happy talking to other guys too. [4] X Research source Think of flirting with other guys as a way of keeping your options open."

No guy wants to date a girl who seems like she has a confidence problem so he can help her get over all of her insecurities. It's okay: everyone is insecure. But the more you work on l oving who you are , how you look, and what you do, the more appealing you'll be to the guy. [5] X Research source You want the guy to think that you're already awesome and that he'll just be adding to your awesomeness; not that you need him to make you whole. If you want to feel confident, then you have to look confident. Walk with your head high, looking straight ahead of you, instead of down at the floor, and smile every chance you get."

It does mean that you should have fun wherever you go, go a little crazy, and just have the time of your life no matter what you're doing. Guys are drawn to women who are fun-magnets, and if you're the life of the party, the guy will want to be around you even more. And if you're in a bad mood or just not really feeling it, go home. It's better to leave if you're feeling grumpy than to force yourself to have a good time."

Sure, your third date might have gone fantastically well, but that doesn't mean you should start calling or texting the guy every hour to find out where he is and when you can hang out again. Even if you know he's into you, keep your distance, tone down the PDA, and let him see that you're your own person with your own interests and schedule. The second you want to be around him 24/7 is the second he'll start rethinking your initial connection. When you call him, don't just call to see how he's doing or what's up. Call to make plans or to talk over something concrete, so you don't look desperate . Make sure to give him some of what he wants. If he wants to see you 24/7, make sure to see him at least once or twice a week. Don't be so afraid of being clingy that you're never around."

If he asks what you're doing that weekend on a Tuesday or Wednesday, tell him you're booked, but that you're free one night the following weekend. If he texts you one day and wants to hang out just a few hours later, tell him you have plans; he can't think that he has you at his beck and call. Make sure to find a balance. Don't pretend to be so busy that you never end up hanging out with the guy. Just don't make it look like your schedule is wide open.

You should hang out with him, hook up or do whatever you want, and leave while you're still having a great time and enjoying each other's company. This doesn't mean you should excuse yourself in the middle of a make out session, but it does mean that you should leave him when you're both really feeling each other, instead of lingering around too long until you both get bored. [7] X Research source If you stay over, leave after some morning cuddling or breakfast; don't stick around looking all rumpled well into the afternoon. It goes without saying: don't sleep with him right away. If you've just started to date, you don't want him to think that you're open for business whenever, wherever.

      "content": "Take it slow. Don't rush into the relationship if you want it to last. If you start talking about how many kids you want to have or rush to have him meet your parents and fifty closest friends after the third date, he will run for the hills. Instead, start off by seeing him just once a week or so, and don't rush to text or call him unless you have something to discuss. And, obviously, tone it down on the compliments or displays of affection until you know each other better. [8] X Research source It's tempting to rush in to a relationship that feels really right. But if you want to keep his interest, you have to keep him at a distance -- to an extent, anyway."

This will show him that you're independent, self-assured, and that you know what you like and aren't afraid to go after it. Don't just drop your weekly yoga or art class just because it doesn't fit with the guy's schedule; in fact, let him know when you're going to be off doing your own thing and he'll like you even more for it. Your schedule should be busy enough so that you have time to do the things you love, but not so packed that you only have time every three weeks to go on a date. Don't be afraid to talk about the things you love with the guy, however far from mainstream they may be. This will only make him be even more interested in you."

Don't just start spending all of your time with your guy and abandon all of your single friends; keep on dancing, going out to eat, or doing whatever it is you love to do with your lady friends. And when you go out with the ladies, let the guy know. He may get a little jealous thinking about what you and your friends may be up to without him. Even if you're just having harmless fun, making him a little jealous will get him to realize that he likes you even more. Staying connected to your girlfriends will also keep you grounded and will deter you from getting into one of those obsessive relationships."

If you put it all on the table and he knows exactly what you're up to every day of the week, then he'll think he has you in the palm of his hand.

Compliment him, ask how he's doing, and generally show him that you care. If you want him to stick around, you have to put in some of the effort. Just one simple compliment can go a long way.

Though you may be determined to play hard to get and to keep things a bit mysterious, you have to end up telling the guy how you feel if you want to keep him. You don't have to declare your love to him right away or tell him your fifty favorite qualities of his, but hey, if you do like the guy, it won't hurt to be honest with him. Tell him you had fun on your date, that you love hanging out with him, that you love his quirky sense of humor, whatever. If you don't give him anything to work with, he'll lose interest--fast. And don't send him mixed signals, either. Telling him he's hot one night and being distant the next will just confuse him, not turn him on."

That means that, in any successful, long-lasting relationship, the courtship is never really over. Both you and your guy will continue making each other happy and will keep things exciting, interesting, and flexible. Don't stop flirting, being coy, or making your man continue to win you over, as long as he does the same.

You will definitely need to adjust your schedule to make room for any serious love interest, but you should keep pursuing your interests, hanging out with you girlfriends, working out, or doing whatever it is you loved to do before you met the guy.
