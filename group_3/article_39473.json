You should still be yourself, but take extra care with your hair and makeup and outfits, so he can start to notice you. You don't have to wear a tight dress and high heels if you're at a baseball game with him, but let him know that you care about your looks when you're around him.. [1] X Research source Don't be afraid to be a little sexy. If you're comfortable with your body, show it off. If you're not comfortable with a lot of makeup, then you shouldn't try to look like someone else just to impress him. Try wearing a little lip gloss, and applying it in front of him. This will make him pay more attention to your lips."

      "content": "Break the touch barrier. Once you get closer to the guy, don't be afraid to gently hit him on the arm or shoulder if he's said something funny. You can make physical contact if you're teasing each other, or even give him a big hug when you meet up, if it feels right. Breaking the touch barrier will help him see that you want to get closer to him. [5] X Research source Just make sure that he wants to touch you too and that you're not making him uncomfortable. If you're getting close with the guy and just came back from a run together or some other form of physical activity, offer to give him a massage. If he likes you, he'll say yes, and he'll start to see how good you can make him feel."

You don't have to say, \"Wow, you're so hot\" to let a guy know that you like him through some subtle compliments. If he got a new haircut or is wearing an obviously new shirt, just tell him that he looks nice. If he's really good at a skill, whether it's math or making a great sandwich, let him know he's good at it. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Ask if he likes anyone. This is not the most subtle way to show that you like him, but it'll do the trick. Just casually ask if he likes anyone, or even talk about what he's looking for in a relationship. Let him open up and see if he tells you he likes anyone or what he's looking for. Just be careful -- let him see that you're asking for your own motives, not because you want to be a great buddy and talk about his love life."

Don't make it sound like you're desperate to date anyone around you -- show him that you've put a lot of thought into it. You can be more obvious and even talk about the qualities you're looking for in a boyfriend, and list some of the things that make him special."

Though there's no sure fire way to know if the guy returns your feelings, there are a variety of signs that can let you know how he really feels about you.

You should pick a time and place where you can both be alone and free of stress, and then keep cool as you tell him that you have feelings for him. Don't put a lot of pressure on him or yourself and wait for a response."

If he doesn't return your feelings, that's OK too -- just show him how mature you are by not getting too upset, or even getting angry, because he doesn't share your feelings. If it turns out he likes you, then you can even laugh about all the ways that you tried to show him that you liked him. If he doesn't like you, don't despair. Be proud of yourself for working up the courage to share your feelings and move on."

      "content": "Take the friend approach. If you want to make your guy friend date you , then you've already set a solid foundation for your relationship. But if you're not really friends with the guy yet, then befriending him can help you show him that you like him. If you don't know the guy at all and he barely knows who you are, it'll be tougher to show him your true feelings. Also, getting to know him as a friend will help you see if you're really compatible, and will give you a chance to show him how awesome you are in a low-pressure setting. [7] X Research source Start by being friendly. You shouldn't ask him to hang out or reveal your most intimate thoughts to him right away. Just take it easy and start building a fun and friendly rapport with him. Ease into the friendship. Don't overwhelm the guy by always being around. Just slowly start increasing the amount of time you spend with each other. Don't fall into the Friend Zone. You should try to be his friend, but don't develop such a deep friendship that it'll get weird if you try to take things to a romantic level."

If you want to get to know the guy, you can start talking about all of the things you have in common, from your families to your favorite sports teams. If you don't have so much in common, you can learn from each other and may find yourself picking up on some of his interests. And if you want to pretend to care a little more about his favorite sports team than you really do, then that's okay too. [8] X Research source Most guys love talking about sports . If you both like the same sports team or sport, you can talk about it; if not, you can read up on his favorite team and casually drop some facts. Use music as a common bond. See if you have any of the same favorite bands -- if not, ask if he has any recommendations for you. If you've developed your friendship enough, you can even make him a CD of your favorite music to grab his attention. Talk about your families . Keep it light and talk about your siblings or any pets you have or had growing up. See if you like the same type of food . If he finds out that you love sushi too, he'll be more likely to ask you to go to the new sushi bar in your neighborhood."

Find a common thing that the two of you can laugh about, whether it's the fact that one of your mutual friends never matches, or the creepy poster in the back of your math class.

      "content": "Offer friendly favors. Once you get to know him a bit, you can offer to give him a ride or to pick up lunch, if he looks like he needs a favor. If you can't do that, offer to carry something for him. Though this will be a small gesture of friendship, he'll also begin to see that you really care about him. Just make sure that he's offering to help you out from time to time too, so the relationship isn't all one-sided. If he misses class, offer to take notes for him or to drop them off. If you're picking up coffee on the way to meet him, ask if he wants something too. Just remember to not overdo it. You're not his partner yet, so you shouldn't offer to do his laundry or grocery shopping."

Play it cool and not ask for it like you're asking him to go out on a date. Instead, just ask him for his number so you can text him about when everyone is meeting at the bar, send him details to your party, or whatever. If he's a nice guy, he won't say no or think it's weird. Getting his number will increase the amount of contact you have with him. Now you can start chatting through text and can take your relationship to a new level. Once you do get his number, make sure that you're not the only one calling and texting him."
