      "content": "Shuffle the dominoes face-down and draw 7. Before you play a game of dominoes , place all the dominoes face-down on the table, and use your hands to shuffle them around until they’re thoroughly mixed up. Then each player draws 7 dominoes into their hand. Place your own dominoes in front of you, so that only you can see their pips, or dots. [1] X Research source Shuffling this way is sometimes called “washing the dishes.” Push the rest of the dominoes off to the side, and keep them face-down. This is the “boneyard,” and you’ll draw new dominoes from here. This game uses either “double six” or “double nine” dominoes, which are dominoes where the highest number of pips is a pair of sixes, or nines, on 1 domino."

This is known as the “spinner,” and you’ll play other dominoes onto it. If someone has the double-six domino, that player goes first, since it’s the highest double. Otherwise, the next highest double is played. [2] X Research source"

This domino must match the first domino on at least 1 side. For example, if the first domino was a double-six, this next domino must have a set of 6 pips on one end. [3] X Research source Place the domino perpendicularly so that the matching number is touching the middle of the first domino. You can play a matching domino onto either side of the spinner."

      "content": "Take turns playing dominoes that match the number of an end domino. End dominoes are the dominoes at the “end” of the line of dominoes. At the start, there will be 2 ends, and you can play a domino on either side of the first domino. As the game goes on, the train of dominoes may split when you play a double, making new ends. Players take turns playing dominoes onto the table that match one of the ends. [4] X Research source For example, you may place a 2-6 domino onto the 2 side of another, as long as the 2 side is on the end. Doubles are placed perpendicular to the end domino, so that the end domino touches their middle. This creates 2 new ends, and also 3 new locations for another domino—on either side of the double, or in its middle."

If you’re playing multiple rounds, the winning player counts the number of pips on the dominoes left in their opponent’s hand, and adds that to their own score. Play 4 more rounds (or however many you like), and the player with the higher score at the end of the fifth round wins the game. [6] X Research source Sometimes, neither player will be able to play from their hand, and there’ll be no dominoes left to take from the boneyard. In this case, the player with the lower number of pips in their hand wins, and their score is the number of pips in their opponent’s hand."

[7] X Research source Shove the rest of the dominoes off to the side, keeping them face-down. This is called the “boneyard.\" This game is played with a set of double-six dominoes, which are dominoes that have a maximum of 12 pips on a single domino. This game is a lot like Straight Dominoes (described above), but with a twist on the scoring system."

For example, you could play a 2-3 domino onto a a 3-4 domino, so that the 3s touch. [10] X Research source Double dominoes are played perpendicularly, so that their center line touches the domino on the end.

If they do, you score! Count up the pips on the exposed ends, and add that number to your score. If the pips on the ends don’t add up to a multiple of 5, you don’t score any points. [11] X Research source For example, say you played a domino with an exposed end of 3. Across the table, there’s an exposed end with 5 pips, and another exposed end with 2 pips. This adds up to 10, which is a multiple of 5, so you earn 10 points. Both sides of a double domino on the end of the train count toward this number. The first domino played does not score points."

The player with the most points wins! [13] X Research source Sometimes, nobody will be able to play any tiles, and the boneyard will be empty. In this case, the last player to play a domino is considered the “finishing” player who earns bonus points. Feel free to play multiple rounds, with the score rolling over to each new round. Keep playing until someone hits a score of 250, which means they win."

[14] X Research source Mexican Train is played with “double twelve” dominoes, which are dominoes where the highest value is 24, or 12 pips on both sides.

[16] X Research source For example, you may play a 12-4 domino onto the starting 12-12 domino. Then, you may play a 4-1 domino onto that, and so on. On your turn, you may also start a new “public” train off of the starter domino.

Double dominoes are played perpendicularly, so that their center line touches the last domino. If you cannot play another domino—like when you don’t have one that matches—this starts an “open double.” Open doubles are played like this: [18] X Research source Immediately draw a new domino. If you can play it onto the double, do so, and the open double closes and the game continues as normal. If you cannot play it onto the open double, you forfeit your train, and the other player may play dominoes onto your train until you draw and play a domino onto it. However, if you can’t immediately close your train, the other player must also attempt to do so. If they also can’t close it, either by playing from their hand or drawing, they also forfeit their own train.
