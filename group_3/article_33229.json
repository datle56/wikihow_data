You may want to put blankets or pillows underneath them, both for their comfort and their protection in case they are dropped. The lifters should kneel or sit beside the liftee, preferably with one person at each shoulder and one person at each knee. If you have a fifth person, they should kneel at the liftee’s head.

This person is in charge of guiding the group through the trick, so they must know how to do the trick from start to finish. It helps if the leader is a bit theatrical. The leader has to tell the group about the spooky, supernatural origins of the game , and it's much more fun if they really sell it!"

Attempt to lift the participant off of the ground—the lifters probably won’t be able to move the participant very high, if at all. They will likely feel too heavy to lift with just two fingers. [3] X Research source At this point, the leader should tell the group that it isn't working because the participant hasn't become \"possessed\" yet. Because the group hasn't performed their mystical chant, the spirits have not yet been summoned. Now, it's time to get serious (ly magical) ."

Once you’ve established how difficult it is to lift the person, it’s time to employ some simple \"mind over matter\" tricks to increase your group strength—or at least increase the mystical nature of the game! Start by having the leader say the phrase “She’s looking ill,” which the other lifters will repeat. Continue this call-and-repeat pattern several times, then do the same thing with the phrases “she’s looking worse,” “she’s dying,” and “she’s dead.” [4] X Research source In another variation, the leader will tell a story about the death of the participant, which will unsettle the group and add to the creepy ambiance of the game. The leader can be creative with the explanation. For example, the leader can explain that the person’s body will be overtaken by the spirit of a deceased person, turning corpse-like and levitating . Make it as creepy or funny as you’d like! Dimming the lights and adding candles can add to the supernatural quality of the trick."

Then, have each lifter hold their hands over the sitter’s head for a few seconds—explain that they’re “transferring” their energy into the sitter to make them magically weightless.

      "title": "The trick to “light as a feather” is to have all players lift at the same time.",
      "content": "The trick to “light as a feather” is to have all players lift at the same time. “Light of a feather, stiff as a board” is based on physics. The weight of the person being lifted must be divided equally between each lifter, so each player must apply their lifting force at the exact same moment. Otherwise, the lift will fail, as it often does in the test run. [11] X Research source The need for synchronization is the reason why the chant is so important to the game—repeating a phrase in unison will naturally encourage the lifters to move at the same time. If this synchronization doesn’t happen naturally, however, the leader of the group may also instruct players to lift on the count of three. The stiffness of the lifted player also helps this trick work. As the lifters chant the words, the lifted player will become stiff and focused. When their body is rigid and their muscles tensed, the lifting becomes much easier."

      "content": "The ‘light as a feather game’ is not fake, but it’s based on physics (not magic). The spooky slumber party game can definitely work, so it’s not necessarily fake. However, the ability to easily lift one person in the game is based on physical science, so it has nothing to do with spiritualism, supernatural forces, or witchcraft. [12] X Research source Keep in mind that, even if the game works, the participant in the middle will really only be lifted for a few seconds at most. Some people have exaggerated memories of playing the game as children where they’ll recall the subject levitating for some time, which shouldn’t be possible and isn’t based on fact or evidence."

      "content": "The earliest records of the ‘light as a feather’ game come from the 1600s. In a diary entry from 1665, British naval administrator Samuel Pepys recorded observing the game being played by a group of young girls in France. However, we don’t know how far the game goes back before this diary entry or how the girls themselves learned the game. [13] X Research source Pepys also recorded the game’s spooky chant, which is similar to but distinct from today's “light as a feather, stiff as a board.” The original chant went as follows: Original French: Voici un corps mort / Raide comme un bâton, / Froid comme le marbre / Léger comme un esprit, / Lève-toi au nom de Jésus-Christ! Translated English: Here is a body / Stiff as a stick / Cold as marble / Light as a spirit / Lift yourself, in the name of Jesus Christ The next official record of the game comes from 1857’s The Magician’s Own Book , which describes a new variation of the game (similar to the chair variation ) that’s played in Venice, Italy. [14] X Research source In the modern day, the game is often associated with spiritualism, sciences, and spooky slumber party activities. It also became increasingly popular after it was featured in the film The Craft (1996). [15] X Research source"
