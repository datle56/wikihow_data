Appearing calm and confident is important when you’re turning someone down, even if you don’t feel particularly calm or confident on the inside. It shows the person that you’re serious, sure, and strong. [1] X Expert Source Collette Gee Relationship Coach & Certified Violence Prevention Specialist Expert Interview. 1 May 2020. How you phrase this really depends on the situation, if you’re alone, and how unsafe you feel.

Go to source For example: If you don’t feel particularly threatened, try, “No, I’m not interested.” If there are other people around, try something like, “No, leave me alone.” If you’re pretty uncomfortable, try, “No, and I’d appreciate it if you’d back off.” Be extremely firm if you feel upset. Try something like, \"Do not whistle at me,\" \"No, move away from me now,\" or \"Do not touch me.\" [3] X Research source"

      "content": "It’s important to be assertive so you don’t send mixed signals. Averting your eyes and looking nervous can come off as hesitant or even weak. The other person may think you can be convinced, coerced, or taken by force. Even if you're not feeling particularly unsafe or threatened, looking them in the eyes shows them that you’re confident and sure about what you want (and don’t want). [4] X Research source Ignoring the person won't nip the behavior in the bud, unfortunately. It’s better to deal with it right then if you feel uncomfortable."

      "title": "Use “I” statements in a calm voice to make your point clear.",
      "content": "Use “I” statements in a calm voice to make your point clear. If the person hasn’t said anything to you but they keep inching closer and closer, it can be upsetting. This kind of behavior is still harassment, even if they haven't said anything to you yet. Instead of staying silent and dealing with the discomfort, call the person out. Be direct and polite, but don’t mince words. Keep your voice calm and use “I” statements when you respond to avoid provoking them. [5] X Research source For example, you could say things like: \"I want you to move away from me.\" ”I don’t like how close you’re standing to me right now.” ”I need more room, please.”"

      "content": "Smiling or openly showing other emotions can be misinterpreted. Unfortunately, if you respond by smiling or being overly casual about the advances, the person may think you’re interested in them. That said, being visibly angry, scared, or annoyed probably won’t help the situation either, and could even make it worse. The best thing to do is keep your face neutral and serious so there’s no ambiguity in your response. [6] X Research source Lifting your chin and keeping your shoulders back can also show them how serious and confident you are. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Saying “I have a boyfriend/girlfriend” isn’t ideal, but it can do the trick. You shouldn’t have to give anyone an excuse for why you’re turning them down. If you feel uncomfortable or unsafe, though, it’s more important to get yourself out of the situation as quickly as you can. [8] X Research source You can tailor your response to the situation and how unsafe you feel. For example: ”I'm not interested. I have a boyfriend.” ”I’m in a relationship and my girlfriend will be back any minute so...” ”Sorry, I’m taken.” ”I’m happily married, so no.”"

If it happens to you, you could pretend to call a friend and say, “I’m almost there, come meet me” or “I’m right around the corner.” If you’re feeling really scared and there’s some distance between you and the other person, get your phone in your hand and threaten to call 911, or pretend you’re already talking to a 911 operator.

Stopping what you’re doing, even just to respond to them, might be interpreted as an open invitation for more comments. After you give them a firm “no,” break eye contact and get out of there.

It’s best to be crystal clear, especially if you expect to see this person around socially or on a daily basis at work. For example: \"Bill, I'm flattered, but I'm not interested in anything romantic with you. I enjoy being your coworker, though, and I hope you'll respect my wishes and not bring this up again. If you do, our company policies require that I report the behavior to HR.\" \"I value our friendship, Jared, but I'm not interested in you romantically. I hope you'll respect our friendship and not bring this up again; it makes me uncomfortable. If you don't let this go, I don't think we can be friends anymore.\""

If someone is pressuring you to send them pictures of yourself or saying unwanted sexual things in texts/emails/DMs, it still counts as harassment and you don't have to take it. Immediately stop responding to that person. If you feel physically threatened or afraid, consider telling someone you trust or reporting the behavior to the police.

It's normal to want to respond in a polite way that excuses the other person's behavior, especially in awkward situations at work or school. For example, you might want to say, \"I'm sorry, but I'm not interested,\" or \"I'm sorry if I gave you the wrong idea\" just to smooth things over. You don't need to apologize for how you feel, though. [16] X Research source Apologizing allows the person to get away with their behavior. You don't need to feel sorry about holding them accountable for their actions. Holding them accountable makes you strong!
