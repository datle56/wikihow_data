Someone who’s shiesty has a reputation for being morally questionable, opportunistic, and only thinking of themselves. They might lie, cheat, peddle scams, refuse to help others, and act shifty while pretending that they’re honest. [1] X Research source “Jess is shiesty. She said she lost my dress but I saw her wearing it today!” “Don’t be shiesty, I know you have an extra pen!

      "content": "Call out someone’s bad behavior by calling them shiesty. When someone you know is being dishonest, sneaky, or inconsiderate, don’t let them get away with their behavior. Confront your friend in private when you both have time to talk. Simply use “I” language to tell them how their behavior makes you feel. Then, work together to set expectations about your friendship and improve your relationship. [3] X Research source “I feel like you’re being shiesty by avoiding my calls about paying me back. Can we find a time to talk about this? If there’s something going on I’m happy to work with you and figure this out together.” “Honestly, you’re being shiesty. Do you have a second to talk about this? I feel upset when you expect me to clean up after you but you don’t clean up after yourself.” If a stranger is being shiesty, let other people know to steer clear of them so they don’t get duped and hurt by their actions."
