      "content": "Remove the laces and insert shoe trees before brushing suede shoes. Taking the shoelaces out of your suede shoes will make it easier for you to brush them thoroughly. Either place a shoe tree in each shoe before you brush it, or stuff the shoes with newspaper so they keep their shape. [1] X Research source You can find shoe trees at your local big box store or online. Re-lace the shoes once you're completely finished brushing them."

      "content": "Select a suede brush with soft bristles to restore the nap. Purchase a suede brush —a special cleaning brush designed specifically for suede. [2] X Research source These brushes have soft bristles that will clean the suede without damaging it and restore the nap texture in the process—whether the suede has gone smooth from wear or feels rough and gritty because of age and grime. [3] X Research source Purchase a large suede cleaning brush if you're restoring something like a suede sofa. A smaller cleaning brush will work well on things like shoes or purses. A soft-bristled toothbrush or nail brush will work too, as long as they’re clean."

      "title": "Brush the suede material using gentle swiping motions.",
      "content": "Brush the suede material using gentle swiping motions. Stroke the suede with the cleaning brush using gentle sweeping motions. Only brush in the direction of the fibers (the grain), and avoid back-and-forth strokes. Brush until you’ve covered the entire surface. This will remove any dust or dirt on the suede without causing damage. [4] X Research source Only brush completely dry suede. Let stains dry before brushing. Otherwise, you risk rubbing dirt and grime particles deeper into the material. [5] X Research source Brush your suede weekly to keep it looking fresh."

      "content": "Absorb liquid stains right after they happen, if possible. If you spill something on your suede or it otherwise gets wet, use a paper towel or clean microfiber cloth to blot up the moisture as soon as possible, says home cleaning specialist Daniel Olin. [6] X Expert Source Daniel Olin Home Cleaning Specialist Expert Interview. 12 October 2021. This prevents the wet stain from setting and drying on your suede, which would make it harder to get out. [7] X Research source After blotting, let the suede air dry for a few hours."

      "content": "Dab white vinegar on tough stains with a cloth to clean them. Dampen a clean cloth with white vinegar and gently dab the dirt or other grime stains with it. Saturate the area where the stain is and then let the white vinegar dry completely. Once it’s dry, rub the stain off with a suede brush or soft-bristled toothbrush until the dirt is all gone. [8] X Research source If you’re cleaning suede shoes, put shoe trees or pieces of newspaper in the shoes to help them keep their shape and protect the interior lining of the shoe. Olin says another option is to use gentle laundry detergent, blotting it onto the stain with a microfiber cloth rag and absorbing it with another dry rag.

      "content": "Sand suede using 1200-grit sandpaper to get rid of stubborn stains. Use a piece of 1200-grit sandpaper on the suede so it’s not too abrasive. Rub the sandpaper against the stain gently to scrape it off, moving the sandpaper over the soiled patch evenly for a uniform look. Swipe with a suede brush afterward to restore the nap texture.

      "content": "Cover the suede in a thin layer of clean water to fix water stains. If you have a water stain on your suede bag, jacket, or furniture, the best way to get rid of it is to dampen the rest of the suede with water (not saturate it!) to even it out. Dampen a towel with water and dab the water onto your suede, covering all of it evenly. Once this layer of water dries overnight, the stain shouldn’t be visible anymore. [14] X Research source If you think you might have applied too much water, use a dry microfiber cloth or paper towel to absorb some of the excess moisture. Let the suede dry naturally—avoid putting it near a heat source that could make it shrink or crack. If you’re cleaning suede shoes, put a shoe tree or piece of newspaper in the shoe so it keeps its shape."

Let the cornstarch or powder sit overnight and vacuum it up or brush it off with a suede brush the next day to reveal clean suede. [15] X Research source Use your hands to pat the cornstarch or talcum powder into the stain to help it work better. Use a thick layer of cornstarch or talcum powder to be sure it absorbs as much as possible."

      "title": "Treat suede with a waterproofing spray to repel common stains.",
      "content": "Treat suede with a waterproofing spray to repel common stains. Purchase a suede protectant or waterproofing spray to make it easier to keep your suede material clean. Hold the spray bottle 3–5 inches (7.6–12.7 cm) from the suede and apply it evenly to the fabric. Cover the suede in two to three coats, letting each coat dry before adding another one. [16] X Research source Test a small area of the suede before you cover all of it to be sure it works and won’t discolor your specific suede item. Suede protectant sprays are often silicone-based and come in a clear color, so they’re not visible on your suede. Once you treat the suede, you shouldn't need to again for a few months or after you clean it again."

If you've tried to clean the stain and it wouldn't come out, take your suede item to a professional cleaner and ask them if they can get it out. This is also a good thing to do if you're worried about damaging the suede by trying to clean it yourself. This works well if you have a small suede item like a shoe, purse, or item of clothing."

For suede items that are seasonal, like shoes, jackets, and bags, use waterproofing spray at the start of the season and after every cleaning. Store these items in breathable containers like cotton garment bags to prevent moisture from building up and damaging the material.

      "content": "How do you fix suede discoloration? Use a suede dye to fix suede that’s become discolored with age.

[19] X Research source Next, remove the laces. Apply a suede cleaner for deeper stains. Finally, apply the suede dye by dabbing it on the shoe with a sponge. [20] X Research source Apply another coat of dye if needed. Verify that your suede is genuine before trying to dye it.
