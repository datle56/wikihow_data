      "content": "Pray precisely. Don’t be afraid to state what you want in clear and simple language. Ask God for the miracle. It is acceptable to be direct and to the point. Precise prayer requires focus and dedication. To avoid a wandering mind, avoid filling your prayers with irrelevant statements or flowery language—this won’t earn you any extra points! [8] X Research source Repeat simple and direct phrases as part of your prayer. To help you focus, repeat the Catholic “Miracle Prayer.” The prayer goes as follows: “Lord Jesus, I come before Thee, just as I am, I am sorry for my sins, I repent of my sins, please forgive me. In Thy Name, I forgive all others for what they have done against me. I renounce Satan, the evil spirits and all their works. I give Thee my entire self, Lord Jesus, I accept Thee as my Lord God and Savior. Heal me, change me, strengthen me in body, soul, and spirit. Come Lord Jesus, cover me with Thy Precious Blood, and fill me with Thy Holy Spirit , I love Thee Lord Jesus, I praise Thee Lord Jesus, I thank Thee Jesus, I shall follow Thee every day of my life. Amen. Mary, My Mother, Queen of Peace, all the Angels and Saints, please help me. Amen.” [9] X Research source"

      "content": "Pray with Patience. Waiting for a miracle to happen is frustrating. You may feel helpless, hopeless, and lost. You may want to wrangle control of your life from God. Take a deep, calming breath. Don’t lose faith in God. Your prayers are not being ignored. God works on His own timeline and in his own way. While you wait for your prayers to be answered, remain patient and lean on God and others for support. [10] X Research source"
