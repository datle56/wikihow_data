      "title": "No.",
      "content": "No. Tinder doesn't allow image-sharing in their chats, but you can use workarounds to send a picture to the other person you're talking to on Tinder. You can, however, click GIF or send an emoji."

      "title": "Send the picture in a text or with another app.",
      "content": "Send the picture in a text or with another app. Let the other person know that you have a picture that you want to share with them. If they consent , get their phone number so you can message them outside of Tinder. It's easy to send a picture to another person by attaching it to a text message. Simply open your texting app and attach the picture you want to send. If the Tinder user isn't comfortable giving out their phone number, use messaging apps like Facebook Messenger , Snapchat , Kik , Skype, Telegram , or WeChat instead."

    {
      "title": "Upload the photo to your profile.",
      "content": "Upload the photo to your profile. As long as you don't mind that someone else might see the picture, upload it to your profile temporarily. Once it's uploaded, let the person you're chatting with know there's a photo you want them to see. Then, you can delete the photo once they see it. Hopefully, the person you're chatting with will be the only person to see your picture, but that's not a guarantee."
    },
    {
      "title": "Share your Instagram handle.",
      "content": "Share your Instagram handle. While you can attach your Instagram account to your Tinder profile, the feed might not show your recent uploads. If you want to privately share photos, start a DM thread on Instagram. Don't copy and paste a link from Instagram to the chat, as that could be flagged as spam. All of these workarounds are good tips to keep your Tinder conversation going !"
