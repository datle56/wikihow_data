      "title": "Ears & Hearing",
      "content": "Ears & Hearing The concept of ears and hearing appears multiple times—both literally and symbolically—to explore the power of language, the consequences of deception, and the difficulty of ascertaining truth and certainty. Most obviously, the motif of ears appears in a physical sense when Claudius murders King Hamlet by pouring poison in his ear. In a more symbolic sense, many characters are seen eavesdropping throughout the play, and allusions to “hearing” and “ears” are made multiple times in the text itself. [1] X Research source Key Moments: King Hamlet’s ghost reveals that Claudius murdered him by poisoning his ear. He also notes that the “snake” that killed him has abused the “whole ear of Denmark,” meaning that he’s misled the country’s nobility and population. [2] X Research source Gertrude expresses her hurt by saying, “these words, like daggers, enter in mine ears” when Hamlet verbally attacks her for marrying Claudius. [3] X Research source Characters like Polonius, Hamlet, Rosencrantz, and Guildenstern all eavesdrop during the play. Each of these instances ends in more distrust and negative consequences. [4] X Research source Hamlet insinuates that words can be used to twist, lie, and manipulate with the line, “I have words to speak in thine ear will make thee dumb.” [5] X Research source Supporting Quotes: \"Give every man thy ear, but few thy voice.” – Polonius (Act 1, Scene 3.) [6] X Research source Suggests that it’s important to consider others’ opinions but be discerning when offering your own. “Here is your husband, like a mildewed ear, blasting his wholesome brother.” – Hamlet (Act 3, Scene 4).

      "title": "Poison",
      "content": "Poison Poison appears throughout Hamlet to symbolize corruption, ambition, and revenge. The motif is used both literally—as in, a physical vial of poison being used—and symbolically—as in, the way that Hamlet’s mind is “poisoned” by revenge. All of these appearances of poison in the play are used to explore desire and ambition and their consequences. [9] X Research source Key Moments: Claudius murders his brother (King Hamlet) by putting poison in his ear. [10] X Research source Laertes poisons the tip of his rapier to kill Hamlet. Gertrude dies from drinking poisoned wine. Hamlet forces Claudius to drink his own poison. Hamlet’s mind is poisoned by madness and vengeance. Claudius’ ambition leads to him claiming the throne through murder, spreading the “poison” of his corruption throughout the court and country. One murderous act (King Hamlet’s death) figuratively poisoned the minds of the rest of the characters, leading to several violent deaths. Supporting Quotes: “O this is the poison of deep grief, it springs all from her father's death.” – Horatio (Act 4, Scene 5). [11] X Research source Describes how Ophelia’s mind has been affected by the grief of her father’s death. “I'll anoint my sword... I'll touch my point with this contagion, that if I gall him slightly it may be death.” – Laertes (Act 4, Scene 7). [12] X Research source Reveals Laertes’ plan to poison his sword in order to easily kill Hamlet. “Here, thou incestuous, murderous, damned Dane, Drink off this potion.

      "title": "Acting & Performance",
      "content": "Acting & Performance The repeated references to plays and performances in Hamlet help to explore how people’s appearances and the ways they present themselves to the world differ from their actual reality. Hamlet is constantly unsure of who he can actually trust, becoming overly fixated on how others portray themselves for deceitful intents. [14] X Research source Key Moments: Hamlet stages a play-within-a-play that mirrors his father’s murder in order to assess Claudius’ guilt. He ends up being deeply disturbed by the actors’ stirring performances, blurring the line between fiction and reality. [15] X Research source Hamlet allegedly feigns or performs his “madness” to the court and his family. Hamlet believes that Claudius’ demeanor of piety and grief over his brother’s death is all an act. Supporting Quotes: “These indeed ‘seem,’ for they are actions that a man might play.” – Hamlet (Act 1, Scene 2). [16] X Research source After being asked by his mother about the depth of his grief, Hamlet snaps back by saying that he’s genuinely grieving. “The play’s the thing wherein I’ll catch the conscience of the King.” – Hamlet (Act 2, Scene 2). [17] X Research source Hamlet reveals his plan to stage a play that mirrors the events of his father’s death in order to assess Claudius’ guilt. “The purpose of playing[…] is to hold as ‘twere the mirror up to Nature.” – Hamlet (Act 3, Scene 2). [18] X Research source Suggests that the goal of acting is to reflect the audience’s own realities, virtues, and flaws back to them."

      "title": "Misogyny & Sexuality",
      "content": "Misogyny & Sexuality In Hamlet , the motif of sexuality often appears as references to sin, deception, misogyny, and incestuous desires. The intimate relationships between Gertrude and Claudius and Ophelia and Hamlet are the main catalysts for these themes, especially the connection that Hamlet draws between female sexuality and sin. Incest is also a frequent motif in the play, most often alluded to by Hamlet and the ghost—in conversation about Gertrude and Claudius—and by Laertes regarding Ophelia’s sexuality. [19] X Research source Key Moments: Hamlet is inappropriately fixated on his mother Gertrude, specifically when it comes to her sex life. [20] X Research source Hamlet compares his mother’s marriage to Claudius to incest and attacks her, comparing her marriage bed to a pigsty. Laertes sometimes speaks to his sister Ophelia in a suggestive and sexual manner and even leaps into her grave to hold her after she’s found drowned. After Ophelia sleeps with Hamlet, she realizes he doesn’t care about her, a shameful realization that contributes to her descent into madness. [21] X Research source Hamlet becomes cynical about women throughout the course of the play, believing that female sexuality leads to moral corruption and deceit. [22] X Research source Supporting Quotes: “In the rank sweat of an enseamed bed. Stewed in corruption, honeying, and making love over the nasty sty.” – Hamlet (Act 3, Scene 4). [23] X Research source Hamlet compares his mother’s marriage bed to a pigsty—smelly and corrupt. “O most wicked speed, to post with such dexterity to incestuous sheets.” – Hamlet (Act 1, Scene 2). [24] X Research source Hamlet accuses his mother of rushing into her relationship with Claudius after the death of King Hamlet, and accuses her of incest (given that Claudius was her brother-in-law). “Frailty, thy name is woman.” – Hamlet (Act 1, Scene 2). [25] X Research source Hamlet says this to denounce his mother’s hasty marriage, implying that all women are weak in character. “I have heard of your paintings well enough. God hath given you one face and you make yourselves another[…] It hath made me mad.” – Hamlet (Act 3, Scene 1). [26] X Research source Hamlet blames his madness on the women in his life and the way they disguise their true selves with makeup and feminine wiles."

      "title": "Confused Identities",
      "content": "Confused Identities Throughout Hamlet , multiple characters struggle to figure out who other people are, both on the outside and inside. These challenges are often due to deception, disguise, or the ambiguity of certain situations. The motif is most exemplified by Hamlet’s internal conflict and the feigned episodes of madness that he carries out while he investigates his father’s murder. [27] X Research source All of these scenarios of mistaken and concealed identities fuel the sense of paranoia and uncertainty that runs throughout the play. Key Moments: The first line of the play is “Who’s there?,” immediately introducing the theme of identity confusion. [28] X Research source Hamlet deliberately acts insane to make it more difficult for the court to assess his true intentions. Hamlet mistakes Polonius for Claudius and ends up accidentally killing the former. [29] X Research source Rosencrantz and Guildenstern (Hamlet’s childhood friends) are manipulated by Claudius to spy on their friend. Supporting Quotes: “I perchance hereafter shall think meet to put an antic disposition on.” (Act 1, Scene 5). [30] X Research source Hamlet reveals his plan to feign madness in order to carry out his revenge plot. “Thou wretched, rash, intruding fool, farewell. I took thee for thy better. Take thy fortune.” – Hamlet (Act 3, Scene 4). [31] X Research source Said by Hamlet after he accidentally kills Polonius, who was spying behind a curtain. “Ay, sir, that soaks up the King’s countenance, his rewards, his authorities. But such officers do the King best service in the end. He keeps them like an ape an apple in the corner of his jaw, first mouthed, to be last swallowed. When he needs what you have gleaned, it is but squeezing you, and, sponge, you shall be dry again.” – Hamlet (Act 4, Scene 2). [32] X Research source Hamlet accuses Rosencrantz and Guildenstern—his best childhood friends—of spying for Claudius."

      "title": "The Futility of Revenge",
      "content": "The Futility of Revenge The central plot of Hamlet revolves around revenge—Prince Hamlet is on a journey to avenge his father’s murder at the hands of his uncle, the now-King Claudius. Ultimately, this quest for retribution sets off a tragic chain of events that showcases the destruction and consequences that result from seeking vengeance. [33] X Research source This theme is further underlined by Hamlet’s internal moral dilemma over whether or not to avenge his father. [34] X Research source Key Moments: The ghost of Hamlet’s father appears in the first act to inform Hamlet that Claudius has murdered him and urge him to seek revenge on his behalf. Hamlet eventually does kill Claudius, but he feels no satisfaction in it. Laertes seeks revenge on Hamlet for killing his father, Polonius. Laertes manages to wound Hamlet with a poisoned sword, but Hamlet likewise wounds Laertes, leading to the death of both. [35] X Research source Supporting Quotes: “Revenge his foul and most unnatural murder.” – The Ghost (Act 1, Scene 5). The ghost asks Hamlet to revenge the murder of his father. \"Now might I do it pat, now he is praying; And now I'll do't. And so he goes to heaven, And so am I reveng'd.” – Hamlet (Act 3, Scene 3). Hamlet is about to kill Claudius while he’s sitting in prayer but decides against it as he believes Claudius will go to heaven if he dies while praying. “I am justly kill’d with mine own treachery.” – Laertes (Act 5, Scene 2). Laertes says this after being stabbed by his own sword that he poisoned to kill Hamlet."

      "title": "Death & Mortality",
      "content": "Death & Mortality Death is one of the central themes in Shakespeare’s Hamlet , and it’s also linked to other themes like revenge and inaction. The death of King Hamlet sets the entire plot in motion, with Prince Hamlet—the play’s protagonist—being spurred to seek revenge for his father’s murder. Death appears in other ways, including through Hamlet’s seeming suicidal ideation and contemplation over the mortality of the jester Yorick. [36] X Research source Key Moments: King Hamlet is murdered before the start of the play, but his ghost seemingly appears to tell Hamlet to avenge his murder at the hands of his brother Claudius (the new King). Hamlet contemplates suicide and the exhaustion of life in his famed “to be or not to be” soliloquy. When Hamlet sees the bones of the jester Yorick, he muses on the finality of death and how all people end up the same way—regardless of their wealth, status, or personality. Supporting Quotes: \"To die, to sleep. To sleep, perchance to dream, ay there's the rub. For in that sleep of death what dreams may come.” – Hamlet (Act 3, Scene 1). [37] X Research source Hamlet muses on death as a sort of sleep where he might be able to find peace, but he doesn’t know if he’ll really be able to escape his problems. \"Thou know'st 'tis common, all that lives must die,/Passing through nature to eternity.\" – Gertrude (Act 1, Scene 2). [38] X Research source Gertrude is comforting Hamlet by acknowledging death as a natural part of life. “Here hung those lips that I have kissed I know not how oft. Where be your gibes now? Your gambols? your songs? your flashes of merriment, that were wont to set the table on a roar? Not one now, to mock your own grinning? quite chap-fallen.” – Hamlet (Act 5, Scene 1). [39] X Research source Hamlet reflects on how the now-dead Yorick used to be full of life and joy that’s now gone."

      "title": "Decision vs. Indecision",
      "content": "Decision vs. Indecision The idea of decision vs. indecision—or action vs. inaction—is largely expressed through Prince Hamlet’s actions throughout the play. Hamlet is grappling with a significant moral question: does he act on the desire to take revenge on King Claudius for murdering his father? Despite the ghost’s urging and Hamlet’s own desire for revenge, his overthinking and sense of moral conflict lead to paralysis and much inaction and indecision. [40] X Research source Key Moments: Hamlet is initially compelled to seek revenge by his father’s “ghost,” but he begins to feel uncertain about the ghost’s trustworthiness. Hamlet shows his indecision when he encounters Claudius, praying and defenseless. Hamlet could easily murder Claudius at this moment, but he hesitates due to internal doubts. [41] X Research source Hamlet’s indecision ends in tragedy as several characters’ lives are claimed (including his own). Supporting Quotes: \"To be or not to be, that is the question: Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer / The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune, / Or to take arms against a sea of troubles, / And, by opposing, end them.\" – Hamlet (Act 3, Scene 1). [42] X Research source Hamlet is contemplating whether it’s better to passively endure life’s hardships or actively fight against them (possibly ending his life). \"Thus conscience does make cowards of us all.\" – Hamlet (Act 3, Scene 1). Hamlet reflects on how his internal morality is making it difficult to take action. “Sir, in my heart there was a kind of fighting that would not let me sleep.” – Hamlet (Act 5, Scene 2). Hamlet implies that his conflicted inner emotions about the revenge plot are barring him from sleeping."

      "title": "Mental Illness & Madness",
      "content": "Mental Illness & Madness Mental illness or so-called “madness” is a huge part of Hamlet , especially through the protagonist's actions and inner turmoil. Hamlet claims to fake madness in order to carry out his revenge plot against Claudius. However, many readers believe that Hamlet actually does struggle with mental illness throughout the course of the play, specifically a deep depression triggered by his father’s murder and his mother’s hasty marriage. Ophelia is another character who appears to go “mad” after the death of her father, eventually ending her own life. [43] X Research source Key Moments: The ghost of King Hamlet appears to Hamlet, setting off his mental breakdown and desire for revenge. Hamlet decides to pretend to be crazy in order to mask the true intentions behind his revenge planning. Hamlet wears black throughout the play, signifying his depression and state of mourning for his father and for the country of Denmark. [44] X Research source After Hamlet kills her father, Ophelia begins to descend into apparent insanity or a manic episode, ending in her death by suicide. Supporting Quotes: \"I perchance hereafter shall think meet to put an antic disposition on.\" – Hamlet (Act 1, Scene 5). [45] X Research source Hamlet reveals his plan to feign madness in order to carry out his revenge plot without raising suspicion. \"I am but mad north-north-west. When the wind is southerly, I know a hawk from a handsaw.\" – Hamlet (Act 2, Scene 2). [46] X Research source Hamlet implies that he’s only occasionally “mad” and is mostly in control of his own mind. \"Her speech is nothing, yet the unshapèd use of it doth move the hearers to collection. They yawn at it and botch the words up fit to their own thoughts, which, as her winks and nods and gestures yield them, indeed would make one think there might be thought, though nothing sure, yet much unhappily.\" – Gentleman (Act 4, Scene 5). [47] X Research source A gentleman recounts Ophelia’s descent into madness and how others are trying to decipher her incomprehensible language."

      "title": "The Skull of Yorick",
      "content": "The Skull of Yorick Yorick’s skull is the most famous symbol in Hamlet , if not in all of British literature. Yorick was the jester under Hamlet’s father, the late King Hamlet. When the prince finds Yorick’s skull in the graveyard, he recounts his memories of the jester carrying him on his back as a child and making jokes to entertain the court. He muses on how Yorick’s “flashes of merriment” are now gone and further speaks to how noble figures like Julius Caesar and Alexander the Great are nothing more than common dust now. [48] X Research source Interpretation : The skull of Yorick symbolizes the inevitability of death and the way in which all mortal humans meet the same ultimate end. [49] X Research source In his speech, Hamlet contemplates mortality and how all people are subject to death—regardless of their personality, social status, or wealth. All of these factors aside, every person simply ends up as bones in the ground and dust in the air. Key Quotes: “Alas, poor Yorick! I knew him, Horatio, a fellow of infinite jest, of most excellent fancy. He hath borne me on his back a thousand times, and now, how abhorred in my imagination it is!” – Hamlet (Act 5, Scene 1). Hamlet recounts his childhood memories of the joyful and clever Yorick. “To what base uses we may return, Horatio. Why may not imagination trace the noble dust of Alexander till he find it stopping a bunghole?” – Hamlet (Act 5, Scene 1). Hamlet muses on how a great man like Alexander the Great might end up as flecks of dust around the mouth of a bottle."

    {
      "title": "The Ghost of King Hamlet",
      "content": "The Ghost of King Hamlet The ghost of King Hamlet appears multiple times throughout the play—beginning in the opening scene. In different performances of the play, the ghost may be represented as a real supernatural figure or a projection of Hamlet’s grieving state of mind. In either case, the ghost itself is the catalyst that kicks off the play’s plot. Prince Hamlet must live with the knowledge that his father has been murdered while also being “haunted” by the late king’s ghost—a situation that likely triggers Hamlet’s seeming descent into madness. [50] X Research source Interpretation: King Hamlet’s ghost is most often thought to represent memory and the lingering impact of the past. In Act 1, Scene 5, the ghost tells Hamlet to “revenge his foul and most unnatural murder” and that “the serpent that did sting [Hamlet’s] father’s life now wears his crown.” Before exiting, the ghost gives Hamlet one last instruction: “Remember me.” [51] X Research source Due to this final line, the ghost spurs Hamlet to essentially kick off the violent events of the play. If the ghost hadn’t appeared, it’s possible that life in Elsinore Castle would have gone on as usual—implying that the presence of the ghost represents the ongoing influence of the past, which includes King Hamlet’s death. Key Quotes: “I am thy father's spirit, doom'd for a certain term to walk the night and for the day confined to fast in fires till the foul crimes done in my days of nature are burnt and purged away.” – The Ghost (Act 1, Scene 5). [52] X Research source King Hamlet’s ghost tells of how he can’t rest peacefully until his murder is avenged. “But know, thou noble youth, the serpent that did sting thy father's life now wears his crown.” – The Ghost (Act 1, Scene 5). King Hamlet’s ghost tells that the new King Claudius is the one who murdered him."

      "title": "Ophelia’s Flowers",
      "content": "Ophelia’s Flowers In Act 4 of Hamlet , Ophelia presents different blooms in a bouquet of flowers to the other characters, explaining to each recipient what their gifted flower symbolizes. [53] X Research source This scene comes during her slow descent into so-called madness after the death of her father and Hamlet’s romantic rejection. Later on, when it’s reported that her body has been found in the water, she’s said to have been found covered in garlands of flowers. [54] X Research source Interpretation: Ophelia’s flowers are said to symbolize the different facets of her personality and desires, as well as the way that society’s expectations have corrupted all of those parts of her. The variety of flowers she passes out to other characters in Act 4 (while singing and speaking in a childish and frenzied manner) represents the complexities of her personality. She passes out flowers to represent mourning, remembrance, sorrow, love, and purity—all contradictory emotions she experiences throughout the play. However, Ophelia also notes that all the violets withered when her father died. Since violets represent modesty, Ophelia is likely implying that she no longer cares about following social norms for women of her age and era. When Ophelia is found drowned, surrounded by garlands of these same flowers, it’s clear that Ophelia has been driven to her demise by doing so much to conform to the world of men. In her last moments, she chose to surround herself with the physical symbols of all that she was and could have been. Key Quotes: “There's fennel for you, and columbines. There's rue for you, and here's some for me. We may call it herb of grace o' Sundays. O, you must wear your rue with a difference! There's a daisy. I would give you some violets, but they wither'd all when my father died.” – Ophelia (Act 4, Scene 5). [55] X Research source In her descent into madness, Ophelia hands symbolic flowers to the other characters at court. “There, on the pendant boughs her coronet weeds clamb'ring to hang, an envious sliver broke, when down her weedy trophies and herself fell in the weeping brook. Her clothes spread wide and mermaid-like, awhile they bore her up.” – Gertrude (Act 4, Scene 7). [56] X Research source Gertrude describes how Ophelia’s drowned body was found, with flowers all around her."

      "title": "Hamlet has several famous passages, including “To be or not to be.”",
      "content": "Hamlet has several famous passages, including “To be or not to be.” As one of Shakespeare’s most notable plays, there are many significant quotes that come from Hamlet —the most famous is the titular character’s “To be or not to be” speech. In the soliloquy, Hamlet speculates on whether it’s better to exist or cease to exist—in other words, he’s likely pondering whether or not to take his own life, although modern interpretations differ. [57] X Research source Here are just a few of the other significant lines and quotes from Hamlet : [58] X Research source “Brevity is the soul of wit.” – Polonius (Act 2, Scene 2). Interpretation: People can say more impactful and clever things with fewer words than with lengthy speeches. “To thine own self be true.” – Polonius (Act 1, Scene 3). Interpretation: Be honest with yourself, stick to your principles, act in your own best interest. “The lady doth protest too much, methinks.” – Gertrude (Act 3, Scene 2). Interpretation: Someone is denying something too strongly, suggesting that they’re actually hiding the truth. “Something is rotten in the state of Denmark.” – Marcellus (Act 1, Scene 4). Interpretation: Describes a situation which is morally wrong or corrupt. “That one may smile and smile and be a villain.” – Hamlet (Act 1, Scene 5). Interpretation: Insinuates that someone can hide their malicious intentions behind a friendly exterior. “Though this be madness, yet there is method in't.” – Polonius (Act 2, Scene 2). Interpretation: Suggests that Polonius believes that Hamlet has a strategy behind his (allegedly) feigned insanity."

      "content": "Motifs are recurring images or concepts that carry a symbolic meaning. In books, plays, and other literary formats, motifs are symbols or ideas that show up multiple times throughout the text. They’re often used to reinforce the overall theme or mood of the story. [59] X Research source For example, the repeated use of stars as a motif in Romeo and Juliet is used to underscore the idea that the two lovers’ fates are predestined. How is a motif different from a symbol? A motif is a repeated pattern with thematic symbolism behind it, while a symbol is a singular sign, shape, or object used to represent an idea.
