      "content": "Accept that you’re having a tough time right now. If you’re working through a manic episode, it’s understandable if you’re struggling to sleep—and that’s okay. It’s going to be difficult to fall asleep if you keep focusing on how impossible it is to fall asleep, so take a deep breath. Acknowledge the reality, show yourself empathy, and remember that this is temporary. [1] X Research source Remember that this isn’t your fault. Manic bipolar episodes can be uncomfortable and upsetting, but you didn’t do anything to cause this. If you’ve experienced a manic episode before, you know that you will get through this. As difficult as it may be to sleep right now, you will fall asleep eventually."

      "content": "Stay still to break your impulse to move or fidget. Since you’re in a manic episode, you likely have the impulse to do something. If you’re twirling your hair, picking your nails, or twisting and turning, you’ll activate your nervous system and keep yourself awake. Lie as still as possible. Try leaving your hands in one place and focus on keeping your body quiet. This will make it a lot easier to actually fall asleep. [2] X Expert Source Noel Hunter, Psy.D Clinical Psychologist Expert Interview. 18 December 2020. You could literally picture yourself as a statue or pretend you’re a robot. Some people with bipolar find this kind of visualization helpful."

      "content": "Recite a calming song or poem in your mind. If your thoughts are racing, try replacing your obsessive thinking with something more relaxing. In your head, recite the lyrics of a beautiful song that you love. Alternatively, you can go through a poem you enjoy, or try to remember a poem you had to memorize in school. This can stop wild, racing thoughts in their tracks so you can sleep. [3] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source If you’re sleeping alone, you can try humming or singing quietly. That might have a calming effect and help you get into the right headspace to fall asleep."

You might try listing every street in your hometown in order, or rank your favorite movies. Alternatively, you could create a lineup for a fictional music festival, or make a list of dream jobs. [4] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Any ideas or thoughts that occupy your mind and keep you from hyper-fixating on whatever is keeping you awake should help."

      "content": "Listen to relaxing music to redirect your focus. Throw on some quiet, calming music and focus on the soothing music while you lie still in bed. Classical, jazz, lofi instrumental, and folk music are all excellent options. Keep the volume low and just track the tune. You should find yourself calming down and getting ready to sleep in no time. [5] X Expert Source Noel Hunter, Psy.D Clinical Psychologist Expert Interview. 18 December 2020. Some people with bipolar enjoy listening to binaural beats. These are meditative songs that only rely on 2-3 tones, which supposedly helps your brain relax. There isn’t a ton of science on it, but some people seem to think they work, so it’s worth giving a shot! [6] X Research source You can find these songs by searching online. They’re also on Spotify and YouTube."

Take a long, slow breath through your nose and feel the air filling up your lungs, then your stomach. Slowly release the air from your mouth, feeling your stomach deflate as the air leaves. Practice doing 4 to 6 breaths per minute, repeating the cycle for 10 or more times.

      "content": "Get up and do something calming if you can't fall asleep. If you can't sleep after 15-20 minutes, don't just lie in bed awake. Get up and do something very relaxing that doesn’t involve turning on a ton of lights or looking at a screen. That might mean listening to soothing music or taking a bath, for instance. After a few minutes of activity, try going back to bed again. [8] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source After 15-20 minutes of lying awake, you’re super likely to start focusing on how you can’t fall asleep. In a manic episode, that can spiral out of control fast. Do not look at the clock! If you keep focusing on how little sleep you’re going to get, you’ll likely just fixate on that thought which can keep you up even longer. Try reading a book, which will engage another sense (sight), so that you don’t feel trapped in your mind while you lie there in the dark. [9] X Expert Source Noel Hunter, Psy.D Clinical Psychologist Expert Interview. 18 December 2020. If you’re hypomanic, it’s possible that you’ll get super invested in what you’re reading and stay up even later. If that happens, it’s okay.

Do not take more than directed, even if you’re really struggling to sleep. If you have not been prescribed any sleep medication, you can try taking 2 mg of melatonin with a doctor’s permission.

However, if you have been cleared to drink alcohol and caffeine, keep consumption to several hours before bed. [17] X Research source You may be surprised at the advice about not drinking alcohol before bed. Most people will feel drowsy after one or two drinks. Even though alcohol may help you fall asleep, it does not promote good quality sleep and alcohol is a common trigger for manic episodes. Caffeine is a stimulant, so the last thing you want to do in the hours before bed is stimulate yourself even more than you already may be with manic symptoms.
