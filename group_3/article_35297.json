      "content": "Button Real Longchamp bags have buttons that feature the Longchamp logo and the date.

      "content": "Handle Make sure the handle is made out of thick authentic leather and has a diamond pattern. [2] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Business Review Online and print journal covering topics related to business management practices Go to source On authentic models, the handles are practically thick leather folded in two. They should be fairly flat, while the handles on fake models are slightly rounded. Fakes also tend to be made up of plastic or light leather. On new models, the handles are stiff and become softer through prolonged use. Signs the bag is fake: Flimsy, rounded handles made from cheap leather or plastic."

      "title": "Material",
      "content": "Material Authentic Longchamp bags feature high-quality, authentic materials. The leather on the handles and flap of an authentic Longchamp always has a diamond pattern. The edges are thin and painted, as opposed to fake edges, which are typically stringy and thick. The nylon on real bags is slippery and has a slight sheen. [3] X Research source Signs the bag is fake: Rough plastic instead of nylon, thin faux leather and thick, stringy edges. Leatherworker Mallika Sharma says that real leather has a natural animal hide smell that faux leather doesn’t have. Real leather has a rugged base and imperfect grain patterns, while fake leather seems more perfect and synthetic."

      "title": "Stitching",
      "content": "Stitching On real Longchamp bags, the stitching is always consistent. Take a good look at the stitching at the end of the flap. A good way to tell if your Longchamp bag is authentic is by looking for three thicker stitches at the end of the stitch line. To ensure that the stitching stays together, the final three threads are sewed back inward on real Longchamp bags. [4] X Research source Signs the bag is fake: Long, thin, inconsistent stitching. The stitching on the inside flap is typically dark brown."

      "title": "Zipper",
      "content": "Zipper Authentic Longchamp zippers always feature ‘YKK’ lettering and are easy to pull. The zipper pull should be a hollow circle with a horseback rider in the center. Check for ‘YKK’ lettering on the zipper pull connector, as inauthentic models often lack it. Check for misspelled information on the zipper pull, too. On a fake, ‘Longchamp’ may be spelled wrong. The metal may also be painted on fakes, while real zipper pulls are always nice, solid metal. [5] X Research source Signs the bag is fake: The zipper is hard to pull and features inaccurate, misspelled lettering. The zippers on real Longchamp bags only come in two colors: gold & charcoal grey. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Embossing",
      "content": "Embossing On authentic models, the emblem is always embossed and raised and the specific details are clearly defined. On fakes, the emblem typically isn’t as embossed and may not be as detailed, especially around the hooves. Always check the quality of the embossing to determine your Longchamp’s authenticity.

      "title": "Branding",
      "content": "Branding The branding on authentic Longchamp models will always be spelled correctly and feature a horseback jockey in mid-stride. Check that the jockey appears on the zipper pull cased in metal and embossed above the button on the flap. Real models will also have ‘Longchamp’ branding on the back of your flap that says ‘Le Pliage Type “M”’ with the model type next to it. [8] X Research source Signs the bag is fake: If the branding is misspelled or the jockey is inaccurate, you’ve got a fake."
