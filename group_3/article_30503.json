If the room doesn’t have a lot of natural light, try a white or cream with a slight yellow or brown undertone to help make it feel brighter and cozier.

Wood floors with warm undertones usually look red, orange, yellow, or brown, while flooring with cool undertones appears blue, purple, or gray. If you like a high-contrast style, then choose wall colors that contrast the undertones of your floors. If you want a more cohesive-looking space, use colors that have similar tones. [15] X Research source Example: For floors with blue undertones, you can try matching with blue, green, or purple paints. For a contrasting style, try orange or yellow paint to make a statement. Example: For floors with a yellow honey undertone, use complementary colors like orange or red to maintain the warm undertones. As a general rule of thumb, try to get paint that’s about 3 shades lighter than your floors, but don’t be afraid to play around with contrasting colors."

Try to pull potential wall colors from your furniture and decor so it’s easier to choose a color palette that works well in your space. Before you paint any colors on your walls, hold the swatches up to your furniture so you can see if the colors complement one another or if they clash. [16] X Research source Example: If you have a light green couch, you may choose a more neutral wall color so the colors aren’t competing. Example: If you have a dark wood table or shelving, stick with a lighter wall color to brighten up the space."

If you want to get a better idea of how the color looks in your space, buy a sample of the color. Then, paint a 2 ft × 2 ft (61 cm × 61 cm) section of your wall with the color. Apply 2 coats of paint to get the most accurate color. [17] X Research source Some paint stores have larger swatches that stick onto the wall that are easier to see than the standard size."
