In the resulting menu, select “Add Friends.” After that, you’ll be able to add her with her username, through your phone’s contacts (though you’ll need to already have her number), or with a special Snapchat code. If you don’t have her username, number, or Snapchat code, you can always add her by finding her in the friends' list of a mutual friend. Avoid following her on multiple platforms, like Snapchat, Twitter, and Instagram, on the same day. Doing so might come across as too strong. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Send her casual snaps a few days after adding her. Wait a few days before sending that first snap. Snapping her right away might seem a little desperate. After that, snap her once every other day with things like your dog eating snow, street performers, and the pile of homework you got in math class. On this stage, it’s better not to snap too often. When you send her casual snaps regularly, she’ll come to expect hearing from you. This will develop naturally into more snaps in the future.

Ask her questions about the things she says to show that you’re listening. Use your snaps to paint her a picture of what you like, what you do, and what's important to you."

      "content": "Avoid worn-out and over-the-top expressions. Phrases like “hey, what’s up,” “what you doing,” and “what’s going on” won’t catch her attention and may go unread. Weird and overly silly comments might also result in her ignoring your snaps. [4] X Trustworthy Source Greater Good Magazine Journal published by UC Berkeley's Greater Good Science Center, which uses scientific research to promote happier living Go to source Instead of \"hey, what's up,\" try snapping her a pic in a cowboy hat with the message, \"howdy.\" Aim for a friendly, interested, playful tone. For example, you could write, “they’ll never catch me” with a snap of police driving by."

For example, if there’s a lot of hustle and bustle behind you, you could pretend like you’re running from a crowd. Use snaps of your empty workplace with some witty text (“busy day in the office”) to increase her interest. Show how things change throughout the day. For instance, you could take snaps early in your shift, during lunch rush, and before you leave to indicate how busy you’ve been. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Comment on her Snapchat stories. When you first start snapping, only comment every once in a while. As you begin to snap more, increase your comments. You don’t have to be funny or wacky when commenting. In a story about her playing with a dog, for example, you might say, “That’s the cutest dog I’ve ever seen.” Comments are a great place for you to ask casual questions. If you notice she was at a concert, you might ask, “Who’d you go see?” She’ll likely respond, and you can start talking about music."
