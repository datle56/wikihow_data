      "content": "The light warns of issues with your car’s battery and charging system. The Service Battery Charging System (SBCS) is made up of your car’s battery, alternator, wiring, and electronic control unit. This system keeps your battery charged and powers the lights, radio, and other electrical components while the car is running."

      "content": "When there’s an issue anywhere in the system, your car’s computer sends a warning to your dashboard to alert you to the malfunction. It usually means that the alternator is undercharging, overcharging, or not charging the battery at all. [1] X Research source When there’s a problem with your battery charging system, you may also see dim lights, slow power windows, and a stereo that won’t turn on. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Tighten loose battery cables. Battery cable connectors are secured with bolts but can loosen over time. If the cable becomes loose enough, it can break the connection to the battery when jostled. This insecure connection can prevent the battery charging system from working correctly. If the cables are loose or disconnected, reconnect them to the terminals and tighten the nut with a wrench. Always turn your car off before checking the battery."

      "content": "Check battery terminals for corrosion. Corrosion is part of the normal wear and tear of your car’s battery, but it can also be a sign of undercharging. Look for a white, blue, or green powdery residue crusting your battery terminals. [3] X Research source If you find corrosion, disconnect the battery and clean off the corrosion with baking soda and warm water. Battery corrosion is acidic, so make sure to wear gloves and safety glasses when cleaning it off the terminals."

      "content": "Check to see if the battery is bad and replace it if necessary. Corrosion on your car’s battery is one of several signs that it needs to be replaced. Other signs are a warped or cracked battery case and a rotten egg odor when you open the hood. If you detect these signs, it may be time to replace your battery. If you see a bulging or cracked battery case, handle it with extreme caution. Batteries are made using lead and acid, which pose serious health and environmental risks. Don’t put an old or damaged battery in your trash. Place it in a thick plastic bag and take it to your local hazardous chemical dropoff location, a metal recycling center, or an automotive store. [4] X Research source If the battery isn’t obviously damaged, you can test it with a voltage meter or take it to an automotive store to have it tested. A battery in good condition has a charge between 12.4 and 12.7 volts. [5] X Research source If the battery is bad, remove it and then replace it with a new battery."

      "content": "Check the fuse box for bad fuses and replace them if needed. Fuses can blow if there’s a short circuit in the system, but they can also go bad due to corrosion. Refer to your owner’s manual to help determine where the fuse box is located and what each fuse is called. Scan the fuses to see if any of the internal elements are broken. It’s possible that more than one fuse at a time can blow. Remove the blown fuse and replace it with a new one by gently pushing it into the slot."

[6] X Research source Check to ensure the belt drives the alternator first. With the car running, visually check that the belt is on the pulley and turning the alternator. If the belt is off the pulley, you may be able to fix it yourself by turning off the car and fitting the belt around the pulley again. If the belt is still on the pulley but looks stretched out or otherwise torn, replace it with a new belt . If the belt is installed and not worn, remove the alternator and take it to an auto parts store to be tested. Not comfortable removing the alternator? Have your car towed to a repair shop for testing."

If you’ve tried troubleshooting the most common causes the SBCS light comes on and still haven’t found the problem, check your vehicle’s on-board diagnostic codes with an OBD-II reader . These codes can help you find the issue by showing which part of your car malfunctioned. While you can reset the SBCS light using an OBD-II tool, the light will come on again if the underlying issue hasn’t been resolved. If the vehicle error codes aren’t giving you any clues, it may be time to consult a professional."

When the light comes on, it means your car is running on battery power only, and the amount of time you can keep going is limited. [7] X Research source It’s better to pull over and call for assistance. If you absolutely have to keep driving, turn off all of the “extras,” like the radio, heated seats, interior lights, daytime running lights, and air conditioning to extend your drive time.

      "content": "The battery powers the ignition during the start-up process. The battery stores a finite amount of electricity to power the vehicle. That power is used to start the engine after it’s been turned off. It can also run the car’s accessories without the engine running. Without the battery, your car won’t start. [9] X Research source The battery can also supply extra juice if the alternator is not able to handle the power load while the car is running."

      "content": "After the engine starts, the alternator provides the car’s power. Think of the alternator as a small generator under the hood of your car. It’s connected to the engine through a belt-and-pulley system that makes electricity when the engine is on. The alternator also replaces the electricity expended by the battery during the start-up process. The regulator controls the amount of electricity that flows from the alternator and the battery to prevent overcharging. [10] X Research source"

Your car’s age, the number of miles you’ve driven, and the average temperature where you live can all affect their lifespans. Following your car’s service schedule can keep your charging system running smoothly. The average lifespan of a car battery can range from 3 to 5 years, with some lasting longer depending on how they’re maintained. [11] X Research source Alternators last 6 to 10 years or 80,000 to 100,000 miles, but this is a rough estimate. [12] X Research source"
