To access your call recordings, log in to your account online. You’ll see them listed under “My Recordings.” If you don’t have 3-way calling capabilities, enter your recipient’s number into your account.

An announcement will inform all parties that the call is being recorded. If you hang up, the recording will stop. But if you’d like to stop the recording before the end of your call, press “4” again. [9] X Research source Since you’ll hear an announcement on the call, it’s a good idea to confirm with the caller beforehand that it’s okay to record your conversation. The caller will have to dial your Google Voice number, not your regular phone number, in order for this to work. If you’re using your computer, keep the Google Voice window open when you’re expecting a call."
