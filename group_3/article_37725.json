      "content": "Talk about your erotic fantasies with your partner. When you're lying in bed one night, ask your partner to share one of their favorite sexual fantasies. Then, you can share one of yours. This can be a great way to broach the subject of role playing, and sharing fantasies is an intimate bonding experience. For example, you might say, \"I sometimes think about how hot it would be if we met up at a bar and pretended not to know each other. You could use your best pickup lines on me. Do you ever think about anything like that?\" If the idea of talking about these things face-to-face makes you nervous, you might try texting them instead."

      "content": "Pretend you've never met before. This one's pretty straightforward—arrange to meet each other at a local bar (preferably one you've never been to before). When you're both there, chat each other up like you've never met before, and let the night run its course. [1] X Research source If you're feeling really creative, you can make up a character complete with a backstory or even a fun accent. But don't be afraid to just be yourself!"

      "content": "Play with power dynamics by casting one partner as the authority figure. For a lot of people, power dynamics produce the hottest role play scenarios. Teacher and student is a common pairing, but you could also try doctor and patient or police officer and criminal—really any situation in which one of you is in a position of authority over the other. [2] X Research source The teacher and student role play might include a little erotic punishment, if you're into that sort of thing. Likewise, a police officer could make use of some handcuffs. If you and your partner typically gravitate toward particular roles, it might be fun to switch it up. For example, if you're normally the more dominant one, you might try a more submissive role and let your partner take the lead. [3] X Research source"

Maybe you can be the plumber who comes to fix the sink, or your spouse can be a pizza delivery driver. The erotic scenario unfolds from there and you don't necessarily have to take on an entirely different personality to do one of these. Here are some potentially steamy ideas: [4] X Research source Barista and customer Food delivery driver and customer Plumber (or electrician, or gardener) and stay-at-home spouse Flight attendant and passenger Cooking show host and guest"

      "content": "Create your own spin on your favorite fictional characters. You could re-enact a sexy scene from one of your favorite movies or shoes, or create your own erotic coupling between two characters. Superheroes and spies are good choices here, but go with whatever gets your motor running. [5] X Research source You can also combine fictional characters with other role play scenarios. For example, you might like the barista and customer idea, but you want it to specifically be the coffee shop from the TV show \"Friends.\" Costumes are great for fictional characters—even better if you already have something you could use, such as an old Halloween costume. Fan fiction is a great place to find inspiring ideas about erotic encounters between different characters."

      "content": "Discuss why the role you chose turns you on. Different scenarios turn different people on for different reasons. If you both know why you're attracted to a particular scenario, you'll know how to act to enhance the pleasure. This helps you ensure that your fantasy plays out the way you want. For example, if you're role playing student and teacher, you might be into a punishment scenario, or you might be into the eroticism of plaid skirts and forbidden affairs. You might say, \"I'm really drawn to the barista/customer idea because when I worked in a café I always fantasized that one of my customers would hit on me.\""

      "content": "Talk about things each of you aren't comfortable with doing during the scene. Talking about your boundaries is super important before you get into a role play scene—even if you and your partner have been together for years. Talk about things that will likely happen in the scenario and let your partner know what you are and aren't okay with ahead of time. Limits can involve things you do to each other as well as things you say to each other. [6] X Research source For example, you might be okay with your partner calling you names, but there are certain names that you're not okay with—just let them know what those are. Generally, hard limits are things that are absolutely off the table. Soft limits, on the other hand, are things you might be okay with in the right circumstances. Have an open, honest discussion so that both of you have a good idea of what to expect from your scene and what sorts of things you're allowed to say and do with each other. You might want to have this conversation over text, rather than face-to-face. It can be easier if you're nervous and can be more comforting to have everything in writing so you know that you're both on the same page."

      "content": "Set a safe word either of you can use to end the scene. Safe words or gestures are important for both of you in case the scene gets out of hand. If you're no longer comfortable in the scene, you need to be able to say so—and you might not be able to do that if you're role playing. [7] X Research source This is especially important if your role play scene includes an element of resistance or reluctance. Using a normal word, such as \"no\" or \"stop,\" might not work in that scenario. If you're not comfortable using a random word as a safe word, consider using the stop light method: green means you're good to go, yellow means to slow down, and red means to stop. Gestures are important if one of you is going to be gagged or otherwise unable to communicate verbally."

      "content": "Start with a simple scenario so there's less pressure to perform. A really elaborate scene that requires a lot of prep work can make the whole thing seem like a much bigger deal than it actually is. When it's your first time, remember that a little goes a long way. You'll have more of a payoff if your scene doesn't take you hours to put together. [8] X Research source For example, meeting at a bar and pretending you don't know each other doesn't really require any specific setup, other than maybe wearing clothes you wouldn't normally wear. Other simple scenarios to start out with include plumber and stay-at-home spouse, or delivery driver and homeowner. You also want to give yourselves room to amp things up later. Start off simple and you have less room for error. Then, based on your experience, you know what you can add to improve on it when you do it again."

Sometimes, even a single item is all you really need to establish your character. [9] X Trustworthy Source Science Direct Online archive of peer-reviewed research on scientific, technical and medical topics Go to source For example, if you're a barista, an apron and a visor might be all you need. If you're a plumber, electrician, or other handyman, you'll be good to go with a tool belt. You might also experiment with makeup or different hairstyles to get in character. Sometimes even a small change, such as parting your hair on the other side, can make you feel like someone else. It's okay if you share some of these things with your partner, but try to keep some of them a secret so your partner will be a bit surprised by your look. This works especially well if you're pretending you're strangers."

Props can be something you use yourself or something you include to set the stage for the scene. [10] X Research source For example, if you're pretending to be a masseuse, candles and soothing music are props that could help set the scene for you. If you're playing a police officer, you might want a pair of handcuffs or even a toy gun."

If you're limited to doing your scene at home, make sure there won't be any distractions during the scene (put your phone on silent or take the dog out just before time for the scene to start). [11] X Research source If you're pretending to be strangers, you might want to book a hotel room so you're not coming home to a place where you both live. If you're starting your scene in public (such as at a restaurant or bar) and ending it somewhere else, arrange for transportation and have everything ready so the scene flows seamlessly. If you have kids, have them sleep over with friends or family so you don't have to worry about them."

      "content": "Act naturally rather than trying to be a completely different person. Your first time, it's usually best to stick to a simple character that's not too far away from who you are. That way, you don't have to worry too much about what your character would say or do. But if you're ready for a challenge, brainstorm some dialogue or ideas ahead of time that would really get your character going. [12] X Trustworthy Source HelpGuide Nonprofit organization dedicated to providing free, evidence-based mental health and wellness resources. Go to source For example, if you're meeting your partner at a bar and pretending to be strangers, you might talk in an exaggerated Southern twang and pretend you're from Alabama. It might help to start getting into character an hour or two before the scene starts. For example, if you're portraying a TV character, you might watch a couple of episodes of their show."

[13] X Trustworthy Source Johns Hopkins Medicine Official resource database of the world-leading Johns Hopkins Hospital Go to source It's natural to feel a bit silly when you're doing role play for the first time. Just accept that the silliness is a part of it. Once you both get going, you'll immerse yourself in your role. Remember that there's nothing wrong with laughing or breaking character or delivering a line poorly—that's all part of the fun of role play."

      "content": "Communicate throughout the scene. When you're trying to act in a role, communication during the event can be a bit difficult—but that doesn't mean it's impossible. Think about ways you can tell your partner what they're doing right and what's not doing it for you while staying in character. [14] X Research source For example, if you're playing a student to your partner's teacher, you might say, \"Oh, Professor! I love how strong your hands feel around my waist.\" Body language helps a lot here. You can move and gesture in ways that tell your partner you're enjoying yourself, even if you're not saying the words."

[15] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source If you feel yourself rushing, you might do something intentionally to slow things down. For example, if you're playing as though you're picking each other up at a bar, you might intentionally disagree with your partner (in character, of course) to start a bit of a fake fight."

Tell your partner what you liked and didn't like and find out what their favorite parts were as well. Together, you can come up with ideas for things you might change when you do it again. You'll also build a strong connection as a couple. [16] X Research source For example, you might highlight a particular line that you liked—something that made you laugh or something that really turned you on. What you need after the scene might look different depending on what happened. You might want to take a long bath, or you might want to cuddle with your partner."
