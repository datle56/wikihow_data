      "content": "Pokémon cards are valued by their rarity, set, and condition. To determine the value of a Pokémon card , evaluators look at the card’s rarity stamp to determine its scarcity. Certain sets are also worth more than others, and the earlier the set, the more valuable the cards usually are. A card’s condition also plays an important role, as cards in pristine condition are worth more than cards with noticeable imperfections. Evaluators also look at how in-demand the card is and often use previous sale prices to set their asking price. [27] X Research source Common Pokémon cards are stamped with a circle, uncommon are stamped with a diamond, rare are stamped with a star, and extra rare are stamped with a star H or 3 stars. Usually, common and uncommon cards aren’t worth very much. Holo and Reverse Holo cards are also generally worth more than their matte counterparts. Evaluators also look at each card’s collector number (ex: 50/75). If the collector number exceeds the print number (ex: 78/75), it is a secret rare card that is usually worth more than the standard cards."
