      "title": "Move your pot to a well-ventilated area.",
      "content": "Move your pot to a well-ventilated area. Epoxy fumes are no joke, and are no fun to breathe in. Find an open, well-ventilated space where you can repair your pot so you don’t have to inhale any nasty chemicals. [1] X Research source A room with several open windows can work, or you can repair it outside."

      "title": "Wipe down the broken shards with a cloth to remove any dirt.",
      "content": "Wipe down the broken shards with a cloth to remove any dirt. Grab a clean cloth and brush off any obvious dirt or grime from your terracotta pot so the pieces fit together snugly. It’s okay if your pieces are still a little dusty afterwards—you’ll probably be filling your pots with soil, anyway. [2] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Stir equal parts of epoxy and hardener together.",
      "content": "Stir equal parts of epoxy and hardener together. Pour a blueberry-sized amount of both epoxy resin and hardener on a paper plate or dish. Grab a toothpick and mix them both together before you start reconstructing your pot. [3] X Research source Check the instructions on your epoxy packages beforehand. Some glues might come pre-mixed, so you don’t have to worry about stirring them together. Silicone caulk is also a good option for repairing a broken terracotta pot. You can also buy caulk in a color that best matches your pot!"

      "title": "Mix colored clay powder into the epoxy mixture so it matches your pot.",
      "content": "Mix colored clay powder into the epoxy mixture so it matches your pot. Scoop a small spoonful of powdered clay and mix it in with the epoxy. This helps the epoxy blend in well with your terracotta pot, creating a more seamless finish. [4] X Research source You can find powdered clay online, or at your local ceramics or craft store."

    {
      "title": "Spread the epoxy over the cracked edge with a toothpick.",
      "content": "Spread the epoxy over the cracked edge with a toothpick. Dip a clean toothpick into the epoxy mixture and spread it along the base section of the crack. Keep dipping and spreading the epoxy in a thin layer along the fissure, so your broken shards have no trouble sticking together. [5] X Research source You only need to spread epoxy on the bottom portion of your pot. Don’t worry if you use too much epoxy—you can always wipe off the excess with an acetone-soaked towel or cloth. [6] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Press the broken piece into the glue and hold it for several seconds.",
      "content": "Press the broken piece into the glue and hold it for several seconds. Grab the broken section and center it exactly over the epoxy, as though you’re putting together a puzzle. Hold the shard in place for several seconds with your fingers, or secure it in place with a metal clamp. [7] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Let the epoxy dry overnight so it can cure completely.",
      "content": "Let the epoxy dry overnight so it can cure completely. Double-check the instructions on your epoxy bottle to see how much time it needs to dry and cure. Some products need at least 1 night to cure completely. [8] X Research source Don’t use your pot until the epoxy is completely dried and cured."

      "title": "Sand down the surface with fine sandpaper to make it smooth and flat.",

Work away any imperfections or inconsistencies, so your pot feels smooth and seamless. At this point, you’ll be ready to use your pot again! [9] X Research source"

      "content": "Dust off the pieces of your pot with a clean cloth. Go over the sides and edges of your terracotta pot with a rag, cleaning away any leftover dust and grime. Sometimes, dirt gets stuck in the broken cracks and makes the pot more tricky to repair. [10] X Research source"

Check that the piece is steady before removing your hand. [11] X Research source Depending on the break, you may need to hold the broken shard in place."

Space out these dots about 1 in (2.5 cm) or so apart, like you’re sketching out a row of eyelets on a pair of shoes. [12] X Research source Essentially, you’ll be threading the wire through these marks to “sew” the pot back together."

Set your drill to a high setting, so you don’t have any difficulty getting through the terracotta. [13] X Research source Don’t use a standard drill bit for this—you don’t want to damage your equipment or pot."

      "content": "String the wire through 2 holes above and below the crack. Slide 1 end of the wire through the top hole, and the other end into the bottom hole. Keep the wire even while you thread it, so even pieces of wire are going through the pot. Repeat this process with each set of drilled holes along the broken seam. [15] X Research source"

This way, your pot is much more likely to stay together! [17] X Research source Once you’ve twisted and pushed in all your wires, you can use your pot again."
