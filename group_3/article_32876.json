Every airplane crash dream is different and can be interpreted based on its specific scenario, e.g., being a passenger, a pilot, or an observer in the crash. While plane crash dreams don’t necessarily point to something negative, they often signify that there’s something you need to pay closer attention to in your waking life. Plane crash dreams are fairly common, so rest assured that lots of people experience them and they don’t mean something is wrong with you or your life.

There is no scientific evidence that dreaming of a plane crash means that the events of your dream will come true, or that dreams can in any way predict the future .

Counseling expert Samuels continues to instruct on “paying attention to images that come into your mind…[and] feelings you get in your body. Your spirit guides connect to you through your senses.”"
