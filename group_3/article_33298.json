      "content": "Find a paddleball court to play on. A standard paddleball court is inside a 4-wall room that’s 40 feet (12 m) by 20 feet (6.1 m). The “front wall,” or the wall that the ball gets hit at, should be 20 feet (6.1 m) long and 20 feet (6.1 m) high. The court should have clearly marked lines on it. Midway between the front and back walls, there should be the “short line.” Then, 5 feet (1.5 m) in front of the short line there should be the “service line.” Finally, 5 feet (1.5 m) behind the short line there should be the “receiving line.” Check your local gym or recreational center to see if they have paddleball courts."

The player or team that wins the coin toss gets to choose whether they want to go first or second. Once they decide, give the player or team that’s going first the ball so they can serve. [2] X Research source Use a heavy rubber ball designed specifically for paddleball. When dropped from 6 feet (1.8 m), the ball should only bounce about 3.5 feet (1.1 m) in the air."

If the ball bounces more than once in the service zone, you serve-out and lose the serve. When you hit the ball with your paddle, you want to hit it at the front wall so it rebounds back over the short line without touching the floor. If it doesn’t rebound over the short line without touching the floor, you serve-out.

If the ball hits the back wall after it rebounds off the front wall and before it hits the floor. If the ball hits both side walls after it rebounds off the front wall and before it hits the floor."
