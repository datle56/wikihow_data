      "title": "Rinse the barley with cold water.",
      "content": "Rinse the barley with cold water. Put ½ cup (100 g) of pearl barley in a strainer and rinse it underneath your faucet. Use cold water so your barley doesn’t cook too early and lose any of its flavor. Keep running the water through the barley until it comes out clear. [2] X Research source Stir the barley with a spoon or with your hands to ensure all of the grains are rinsed."

    {
      "title": "Combine the barley, lemon zest, and water in a pot.",
      "content": "Combine the barley, lemon zest, and water in a pot. Pour the rinsed barley into a clean pot along with 10 cups (2.4 L) of cold water. Use a grater or fruit zester to scrape the zest off of a lemon into the pot as well. [3] X Research source If you don’t have a zester, you can remove the entire peel from the lemon and put it in your pot instead."

    {
      "title": "Bring the mixture to a boil for 1 minute.",
      "content": "Bring the mixture to a boil for 1 minute. Put the pot on your stove and turn the burner onto high heat. Let the water come to a rolling boil and let it bubble for at least 1 minute. [4] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Simmer the barley for 30-60 minutes.",
      "content": "Simmer the barley for 30-60 minutes. Set the burner to medium-low heat and let the barley simmer for at least 30 minutes so infuses with the water. Stir the mixture with a wooden spoon occasionally so the barley doesn’t get stuck to the pot or burn. After you’re done simmering the barley, turn off the heat. [5] X Research source The barley flavor in your water will get stronger the longer you leave it to simmer."
    },
    {
      "title": "Strain the water from the barley into a heat-safe pitcher.",
      "content": "Strain the water from the barley into a heat-safe pitcher. Put a heat-safe pitcher in your sink so you can easily pour the water into it. Set a strainer on top of the pitcher and pour the barley into it. Go slowly so you don’t spill any of the water. Shake the strainer to drain any water between the barley grains. You can choose to save the barley or throw it away if you don’t plan on eating it. [6] X Research source You can store cooked barley in the fridge for 3-5 days in an airtight container."

      "title": "Add sugar to the water to sweeten it.",
      "content": "Add sugar to the water to sweeten it. Pour in 1 cup (225 g) of sugar while the barley water is still hot. Use a wooden spoon to stir the mixture while it’s still warm so the sugar completely dissolves in the water. [8] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Mix in lemon juice for a citrusy flavor.",
      "content": "Mix in lemon juice for a citrusy flavor. You can either use juice squeezed from a fresh lemon or bottled lemon juice. Pour 1 cup (240 ml) of lemon juice in the barley water and stir it until it’s thoroughly mixed together. [9] X Research source Test the flavor of your water, and add more lemon juice if you want."

    {
      "title": "Add peppermint leaves if you want to infuse fresh flavors.",
      "content": "Add peppermint leaves if you want to infuse fresh flavors. While the water is still warm, drop 5 fresh peppermint leaves and stir them in. Leave the leaves in the water for at least 20 minutes so the flavors can infuse with the water. After 20 minutes, you can choose to leave the mint in the water or strain them out. [10] X Research source If you want a slight spiciness to your water, add 1 sprig of fresh oregano along with the peppermint. [11] X Research source"

      "content": "Refrigerate the barley water until it’s cold. Transfer the pitcher to the refrigerator so it can cool off. Make sure to cover the pitcher so nothing can get into your water. Leave it there for about 2 hours or until it’s cold enough to drink. [12] X Research source"
