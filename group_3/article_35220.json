      "content": "Understand the different parts of a prescription. Your doctor will always include certain pieces of information on a prescription. The doctor's professional information, such as their name, address, and phone number, will be at the top of the form. In the upper section of the prescription sheet, there will be a place for your name, age or birth date, address, and the date the prescription is given to you. Below this, your doctor will write the relevant drug information, including the medicine prescribed, the dosage, how many pills to take per dose, and how each dose should be taken. [1] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source There will also be information for the pharmacist about how much of the medicine to give you when you fill it the first time and how many times you can refill it. Your doctor will also sign and date the bottom to verify that it was prescribed by a professional. The prescription form will vary depending on what your doctor uses. For example, there may be boxes filled in for the number of refills, or they may be generated by a computer. Regardless of how it is written, the same basic information must always be on the prescription form. [2] X Research source If the prescription is for a controlled substance—one that the government has decided has the potential for \"abuse or dependence,\" such as morphine or methadone—certain additional requirements must be included. The form must stipulate the number of refills (if any) and must be written in ink or typewritten. It must be manually signed by the prescribing physician."

      "content": "Learn how to read the drug name. The main purpose of your prescription is to let the pharmacist know what drug you need in what concentration. Don't worry if you don't recognize the name of the drug. Typically, your doctor will write out the generic name for the drug. This is because the brand names for drugs can be spelled similarly, and it might cause confusion or error at the pharmacy. [3] X Trustworthy Source US Food and Drug Administration U.S. government agency responsible for promoting public health Go to source If your doctor wants you to take a particular brand of medicine, they can write a note to your pharmacist that indicates this need. It will say something along the lines of \"no substitution\" or \"brand name medically necessary.\" There might also be a box on the prescription indicating if your doctor prefers the generic or brand-name version of the medication."

      "title": "Read the dosage information carefully.",
      "content": "Read the dosage information carefully. The number behind the name of the drug is the amount you should take per dose. It will vary depending on the type of medication that you are taking. For example, most pills will be in milligrams, but measurements can also appear in grams or micrograms. The doctor may write out the full word for this, or they may write down the abbreviations. The abbreviation for milligrams is mg , g is for grams, and mcg is for micrograms. If you are taking a liquid medicine or medicine by syringe, the dosage information will be in milliliters. The abbreviation for this is ml . [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Learn the abbreviations for dosage methods.",
      "content": "Learn the abbreviations for dosage methods. On your prescription, the line underneath the drug and dosage concentration will be the instructions on how many doses you should take at one time and the method that should be used to take the medication. The main problem with being able to read these is that doctors typically use medical shorthand, some based on Latin phrases, that you cannot understand unless you have a medical background. For the number of doses, the doctor might write an i for the number of doses you need to take at a time. For example, if you are supposed to take 3 pills per dose, your doctor might write iii on your prescription. They may also write sig, which means to take it as it is labeled to be taken. There are other doctors, however, who will just write what you are supposed to have, such as \"1 tab,\" which indicates how much you should take. [5] X Research source After the amount per day, the doctor will write how to administer your medication. Each method has an abbreviation that is Latin-based. Po means to take it orally, pr means per rectum or suppository, sl means sublingual or under the tongue, IV means injected into the vein, IM means injected into the muscle, and SQ means subcutaneous or under the skin."

      "content": "Decipher how often to take the medication. Next to the dosage methods, the doctor will write an abbreviation for how often you should take your medication. Next to this, they will write any special circumstances under which you should take the medication. This will indicate things such as the need to take the medication with food. The description of how often you should take your medicine is abbreviated using Latin phrases, just like the method. Qd means every day, od means once daily, bid means twice a day, tid means three times a day, and qid means four times a day. The abbreviation qam means every morning, qpm means every night, q2h means every 2 hours, qod means every other day, and hs means at bedtime. [6] X Research source Any special instructions are also abbreviated based on Latin phrases. Pc means after meals or not on an empty stomach, ac means before meals, qhs means each night, and prn means as needed. [7] X Research source Some doctors will write how often it should be taken instead, such as writing \"daily\" next to the dosage information. For controlled substances such as painkillers, they may write out the reason for taking the medication, such as the phrase \"pain,\" if you need certain medications after surgery or for a chronic condition.

      "content": "Look for refills. Your doctor may authorize a certain number of refills for your prescription without needing you to come in for another examination or follow-up. If no refills are listed on your prescription, your pharmacist will need to call your doctor to give you more medication."

      "title": "Prepare questions before your doctor’s appointment.",
      "content": "Prepare questions before your doctor’s appointment. Before you go to the doctor, have some questions ready in case you get prescribed medication. Ask about the medication you are taking and all the details involved in its administration. This includes questions about the name of the medication, how often you are supposed to take it, how to take it, what disease the medication is treating, and if there are any side effects you should expect to have. You can also ask about what to do if you miss a dose and when you should stop taking the medication. It's a good idea to write these out in advance so you don't forget them. [9] X Trustworthy Source US Food and Drug Administration U.S. government agency responsible for promoting public health Go to source You might also want to ask what taking the medicine will accomplish, if there is a less expensive alternative, or if there are any interactions with other prescribed or over-the-counter medications, dietary supplements, foods, or herbal supplements."

      "content": "Ask for an explanation of the prescription. When you visit your doctor, if you are unsure how to read the prescription, you can ask them to explain their instructions for the medication before you leave the office. Use the questions you prepared before you went to the office to understand more about your prescription. Make sure you fully understand any terms they use or any descriptions that you may not know the meaning of.

      "content": "Request that the pharmacist review the prescription. One way to ensure that all the right procedures are followed regarding your prescription is to have your pharmacist review it when you drop it off and when you pick it up. Mistakes can occur when a pharmacist reads the directions differently than the doctor intended.

Once you get your prescription filled, you will get a pamphlet from the pharmacist that explains the medication you are taking, what side effects may occur, and many other medicine intricacies that you may have questions about it. The pharmacist will usually offer to explain the medication and answer any lingering questions you have about your medications. If you experience side effects or interaction effects, call your healthcare provider immediately to report them and request follow-up measures."
