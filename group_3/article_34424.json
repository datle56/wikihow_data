      "title": "Make sure your television and component support S-video.",
      "content": "Make sure your television and component support S-video. S-video cables connect a component (something that generates video, like a DVD player) with a screen (like your television). S-video input slots are circular with several small holes clustered around the middle of the port. Both your component and your TV must have S-video inputs for you to use S-video cables."
    },
    {
      "title": "Count the small holes in your TV and component S-video slots.",
      "content": "Count the small holes in your TV and component S-video slots. This will determine which specific S video cable to buy and whether or not you will need an adapter. S video inputs can be either 4, 7, or 9 pin. If your component S-video input has 7 holes (a 7-pin configuration) and your TV S-video input has 4 holes (a standard 4-pin configuration), for example, you'll need a 4-pin to 7-pin adapter."
    },
    {
      "title": "Purchase your S-video cable.",
      "content": "Purchase your S-video cable. S-Video cables tend to be much cheaper than their high-definition counterparts. A gold-plated connector won't oxidize over time (unlike a silver- or copper-plated connector), so while buying a more expensive cable won't affect your picture quality, it may make for longer cable life. High-quality cables are usually cheaper online than in a store. Amazon, Walmart, and Best Buy are reputable online providers."

      "title": "Purchase any necessary adapters at the same time.",
      "content": "Purchase any necessary adapters at the same time. If you have multiple components that need connecting, such as a VCR and a receiver, purchase an \"S-video cable splitter\" in addition to more S-video cables. Splitters should cost around $5. [1] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Unplug any video input from your TV.",
      "content": "Unplug any video input from your TV. Your TV quality can suffer from having too many video inputs plugged in at once so it's best to start with zero."

    {
      "title": "Plug one end of your S-video cable into your component.",
      "content": "Plug one end of your S-video cable into your component. The S-video slot is round with a series of small round holes clustered around the middle, to match the number of pins on your S-video cable. The small pins on the cable should go in the top of the input. If your TV requires a different number of pins than your component (or vice versa), count the pins first to make sure you're plugging in the correct end of the cable."

    {
      "title": "Plug the other end of your S-video cable into your TV.",
      "content": "Plug the other end of your S-video cable into your TV. Use an adapter if your setup requires it."

      "content": "Make sure your audio cables are attached. These could be red and white composite cables (in which case leave the yellow video cable unplugged) or a higher-end setup."
