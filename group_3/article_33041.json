He/she must find any 2s he/she has and place them on top of the ace face down and say, \"one 2\" or \"three 2s\" etc. However, if s/he doesn't have any 2s, s/he must pick one or multiple cards and bluff. Play goes clockwise. You can bluff with as many as four cards, but the fewer cards you play when bluffing, the more believable the bluff will be, as it would be unlikely to have all four 2s in your hand. Bluffing with a number of cards higher than one is riskier, but the payoff is greater because you get rid of more cards."

[5] X Research source Passing is the safer option if a player doesn't have any cards that match the round's rank, but bluffing will get rid of his/her cards faster. You can bluff even if you have a card of the round's rank. This could be a risky but effective strategy if, for instance, you have multiple cards of the round's rank. The other players will have no reason to suspect you don't, especially early in the round, and they will be less likely to call bluff. You can then on later turns use the actual cards that match the rank, which players will be more likely to incorrectly call bluff on."
