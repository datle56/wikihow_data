      "content": "Search for a cheaper listing on Target’s website or an eligible competitor site. Hop on target.com while you’re in the store and see if you can find a cheaper listing for the physical item you’re about to buy. You can also check other retail sites like Amazon, Best Buy, Costco, CVS, Home Depot, Petsmart, Sam’s Club, Staples, Walgreens, and Walmart. Click here for an official list of retail sites that Target price matches with. You can also check local competitor print ads for a cheaper price listing. You can even price-match groceries at Target. Just make sure that the listing includes the exact same brand, size, and weight as the item that you purchased. The items also need to be the same quantity—for instance, you can’t price-match a single bottle of Gatorade with a multi-pack."

If everything looks good, the cashier will refund you the difference right there. [2] X Research source Unfortunately, you can’t do a price match by yourself in self-checkout. Target’s policy requires a team member to check and confirm the price match."

      "title": "The lower price needs to be active when you’re requesting a price match.",
      "content": "The lower price needs to be active when you’re requesting a price match. Let’s say you’re trying to price match a shirt—you bought it at Target for $22, but you saw it sold on Amazon for $15. That $15 price tag needs to be live and active on Amazon’s site when you request the price match, or else it won’t be eligible. A screenshot of the lower price won’t cut it—the discounted listing needs to be accessible on the website in order for the price match to go through."

    {
      "title": "The item listing needs to be completely identical to the item you bought before.",
      "content": "The item listing needs to be completely identical to the item you bought before. Double-check that the brand, size, color, model number, and any other relevant product info on the listing is exactly the same as the product you bought. Even the slightest difference can invalidate your price match request. For instance, you can’t price match a 60-inch Samsung TV with a 60-inch LG TV."

      "title": "Target may limit the number of items you can buy with a price match.",
      "content": "Target may limit the number of items you can buy with a price match. At the end of the day, Target has the final say in what your price match can be used for. Depending on the item, Target team members might limit the quantity of your price-matched purchases at their discretion. [6] X Research source Let’s say you price match a laptop at Target with the exact same model at Best Buy. Target might limit you to buying one laptop rather than buying 2 or 3 at once. If you live in Hawaii or Alaska, you can’t price match with other online stores. You can still use the price match policy with lower prices you find on Target’s website, though."

Target’s price match policy only extends to brand-new items that are placed on sale or marked down at a lower price. Drastic clearance and liquidation sales won’t be price-matched, nor will used, refurbished, damaged, or pre-opened items. Other exclusions include: Items sold online by third-party sellers Major sales or offers from competitor sites Specialty purchases like alcohol, cell phone plans, warranties, and pharmacy prescriptions Typo-related price changes [7] X Research source"

Target will let you use the same sale price for the next 30-45 days at all Target stores."
