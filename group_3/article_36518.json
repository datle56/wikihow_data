You may want to wear thin gloves to protect your fingers during this process! Gently work the seeds out with your fingers and toss them in the trash. [1] X Research source If some are too stuck to just pull out, don't yank or cut them. Move on to using oil."

      "content": "Rub olive oil or coconut oil around the burs to loosen them. If some burs won't come out, coconut oil or olive oil may help. You only need a pea-sized amount for each bur-matted area. Use your hand to massage the oil into the fur around the burs, running it up and down the fur. As you rub, the burs should begin to move around, and you can gently remove them with your fingers. [2] X Research source You can use any dog-safe oil, such as fish oil, cod liver oil, flaxseed oil, or sunflower oil."

If you live in an area that has 1 or multiple types of these seed burs, make sure you go over your dog's fur every day.

      "content": "Lift the fur to find foxtails close to the skin. Foxtails, in particular, tend to work there way down towards the skin. If they get embedded in the skin, they can cause infections and abscesses. If your dog has foxtails in its fur, make sure to examine its skin, too, by gently lifting the fur up all over the dog's body, particularly if your dog has long fur. [8] X Research source Long-haired dogs are more susceptible to catching burs and foxtails in their fur, but they may go unnoticed, leading to problems."

[10] X Research source If you have trouble seeing between your dog's toes, you may want to clip the fur so you can see better.

If it gets one in its eye, it will likely have a watery, red eye. The eye may swell, causing your pup to paw at it.
