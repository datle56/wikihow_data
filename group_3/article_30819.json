      "title": "Sending 🫠 can mean you’re feeling embarrassed.",
      "content": "Sending 🫠 can mean you’re feeling embarrassed. Have you ever been so embarrassed that you wanted to just melt right into the floor and disappear? That’s exactly the feeling this emoji is going for. The smile on this emoji is like saying “It’s fine. No big deal,” but the way it’s dissolving into a puddle gets across that you’re actually feeling quite mortified. “I just tripped in front of my crush 🫠” “🫠🫠 So I might’ve just walked into a glass door. Totally not embarrassing at all.” “The way I said the wrong answer so confidently 🫠🫠” “🫠 I’m going to need 3-5 business days to get over this embarrassment.”"

      "title": "You might be feeling overwhelmed when you send 🫠.",
      "content": "You might be feeling overwhelmed when you send 🫠. When you send 🫠, it means you've got a lot on your plate. Use this emoji when you’re feeling overwhelmed by work, school, or just life in general. It also adds a hint of sarcasm , letting the other person know that not everything is actually all that great even if you say it is. “I have 10 assignments due on Monday and haven’t started any of them 🫠” “Haha it’s fine I can totally do all of this in 2 days 🫠” “Omg yes please give me more work to do I’m not overloaded at all 🫠”"

      "title": "Using 🫠 can mean that you’re feeling anxious.",
      "content": "Using 🫠 can mean that you’re feeling anxious. Maybe you’ve got a big presentation coming up, or you have to go and have a serious conversation with someone. Whatever the case may be, 🫠 let’s the other person know that you’re dreading what’s about to happen and could use a bit of encouragement. [1] X Research source “Off to go talk to my boss 🫠 Wish me luck.” “My presentation tomorrow and I am NOT prepared 🫠” “He said ‘we need to talk’ and now I’m officially freaking out 🫠” “I’m in so much trouble 🫠”"

      "title": "The melted face emoji 🫠 might be used when it’s super hot out.",
      "content": "The melted face emoji 🫠 might be used when it’s super hot out. This emoji is the literal representation of you when it’s a hot day and you feel like you could melt into a puddle. Let your friends and family know just how sweltering it is outside by sending them a weather update with this emoji. [2] X Research source “It’s literally 100 degrees here 🫠” “I hate summer why is it so hot 🫠” “🫠 This emoji is literally me right now it needs to not be so hot.”"

      "title": "The melted face can also mean that you’re in love.",
      "content": "The melted face can also mean that you’re in love. 🫠 captures all those fluttery feelings you get when you see your crush or significant other. It’s like saying the other person is so nice, amazing, and perfect that you just melt into a puddle when you see them. It could also work for talking about adorable animals or anything else cute that catches your eye. But usually, you wouldn't send this to the person (or crush) that you’re talking about. Instead, send it in a message to your friend as you gush about whoever or whatever is on your mind. [3] X Research source “He’s so handsome 🫠” “I think I just saw an angel walk by 🫠” “Puppies are so cute 🫠” “She was so pretty 🫠 I wish I could’ve talked to her.”"

      "content": "Put the spotlight on something else to make them feel less embarrassed. If your friend is feeling bad about themselves because of something embarrassing, change the topic so they don’t have to think about it anymore. Maybe you have your own embarrassing story that will take their mind off what just happened. Getting them to laugh is definitely a bonus. Or try to put a positive spin on whatever just happened. “Oof that’s rough 🫤. But at least you didn’t trip up the stairs in front of everyone like I did.” “Ok but the important thing is that you still nailed your presentation 😊” “But remember when Daniel sent a message to the wrong group chat? Now THAT was actually embarrassing 🙈”"

      "content": "Send them an encouraging message if they’re struggling with a full plate. When someone you know is feeling overwhelmed, letting them know that you’re there and rooting for them can make a whole world of difference. Send them motivational messages to let them know you’re thinking of them, and offer to help if you can. “You got this! 😤” “Whatever you do you’re going to do great! 🥰 Don’t give up!” “🥺 Let me know if you need anything. You’re going to get through this no matter what.”"

      "content": "Remind them that they’re not alone in facing whatever’s making them anxious. Let them know that you’re there for them and will be there to support them as they face whatever challenges lay ahead. Even if you can’t completely take the burden off their shoulders, just showing that you care and are thinking of them can mean a lot. “You’re going to get through this and come out so much stronger” “It might seem scary now, but I know you’ll do great!” “You have absolutely nothing to worry about because you’re the strongest person I know.”"

If they’re talking about their crush or significant other, tease them a little with some kissy faces and hearts. Or send them 😭 (loudly crying face emoji) to let them know that you’re in total agreement that whatever they saw was extremely cute. “Ooooh you saw your crush?? 👀 I can practically hear the wedding bells 😘” “Omg I LOVE puppies 😭😭” “I agree. He’s very handsome 🥰”"

      "content": "The 🙃 (upside down face emoji) can be used when you’re embarrassed. Much like 🫠, the upside down face can be stuck at the end of a message when you’re telling something about an embarrassing moment you just had. 🙃 can also be used to add a note of sarcasm to your texts and injects your words with some dry humor. “Well guess I can never show my face at work again 🙃🫠” “You know it’s probably better if we just never speak of this again 🫠🙃” “I’m great. Never been better 🙃”"

      "content": "The 😅 (grinning face with sweat emoji) means you’re overwhelmed and slightly nervous. 😅 gets across a similar message as the melting face emoji when it comes to feeling overwhelmed and a bit anxious. But it also emphasizes the fact that you’re slightly panicking over whatever’s happening, something that’s made clear by how this little emoji is sweating even as it puts on a smile. [4] X Research source “Haha I’m totally fine, why wouldn’t I be? 😅🫠” “I’m telling myself not to panic but I don’t think it’s working 😅🫠” “😅 can you tell that I’m about 2 seconds away from passing out?”"

      "content": "The 😶 (face without mouth emoji) conveys despair and also speechlessness. This emoji’s lack of a mouth gets across the meaning that you have no words left to say. Similar to when you use 🫠, this could be because you’re just dreading whatever’s coming and don’t have anything left to say. Or it could also be because you feel silenced, and can be used in a more passive-aggressive way to let the other person know you have something to say. “Literally what’s the point 😶🫠” “Okay I’ll just be quiet I guess 😶” “Well I guess there’s nothing we can do about it now. Just wait for fate to decide 😶🫠”"
