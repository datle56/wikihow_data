      "title": "Buy an e-cigarette kit.",
      "content": "Buy an e-cigarette kit. If you are new to e-cigarettes, you may want to start with an e-cigarette kit, which can be purchased online. Many light to medium smokers go for a rechargeable starter kit, instead of a disposable one, as the e-cigarette can be used many times and is more cost-effective. An e-cigarette starter kit will contain a rechargeable battery, a charger, and a nicotine liquid cartridge. The nicotine liquid can come in a variety of flavors and different levels of nicotine. If you are a smoker who is trying to quit, you may go for a low level of nicotine and a flavor you enjoy tasting in your mouth to limit your nicotine intake. You can get a starter kit with several different flavor cartridges so you can try different flavors and find the ones you enjoy. Most e-cigarette starter kits cost about $40-$100. Consider investing a kit with a higher price point if you plan to smoke every day or at least several times a week. Going for a cheap kit may mean lower quality and poor flavor choices."

      "title": "Charge the battery for the e-cigarette.",
      "content": "Charge the battery for the e-cigarette. Because your e-cigarette runs on lithium batteries, it is important that you fully charge the battery before using it. Many e-cigarettes will come with the battery partly or fully charged. Make sure the battery is ready to go by placing it in the charger and waiting for the charged signal or light to come on. Most batteries for e-cigarettes are rechargeable and can last up to 250-300 uses. Batteries often last longer when they are recharged and used regularly. Avoid placing the batteries in direct sunlight and heat. Do not get them wet or drop them often against a hard surface, as this will significantly reduce their lifespan. Try to charge the battery before it is completely drained and always store your batteries fully charged. Storing the batteries with less than 50% charge left can drain their use in the long term."

      "title": "Screw in the liquid cartridge.",
      "content": "Screw in the liquid cartridge. Once the battery is fully charged for the e-cigarette, take it off of the charger. Then, take the liquid cartridge and screw it into the slot on the e-cigarette. Your e-cigarette may come with pre-filled liquid cartridges, or you may buy e-liquid that you can then drop into the liquid cartridge. Pay attention to the liquid in the cartridge so you can note when the liquid cartridge is close to running out and requires changing. If you are planning on being a regular e-cigarette user, you may want to keep several extra liquid cartridges on hand for easy replacement."

      "title": "Be aware of the difference between smoking a cigarette and smoking an e-cigarette.",
      "content": "Be aware of the difference between smoking a cigarette and smoking an e-cigarette. If you usually smoke traditional cigarettes, you may be used to taking quick, short drags and smoking several cigarettes at a time or chain smoking. When smoking an e-cigarette, it is important that you learn how to take long and slow draws until the vapor fills your mouth. You should also avoid chain smoking an e-cigarette. Only take about three to seven draws at a time and take a break. This will allow a few minutes for the e-cigarette to cool and to give your throat a rest. Smoking too much of the e-cigarette at a time or smoking the e-cigarette for too long can lead to throat irritation and soreness as well as taste bud burnout, also known as “vaper’s tongue”. Give your throat and mouth a rest between e-cigarette sessions so you do not develop any irritation or numbness after smoking."

      "title": "Do a “primer puff”.",
      "content": "Do a “primer puff”. To warm up the e-cigarette, you can start by doing a primer puff. This is a quick inhale into the mouth of the e-cigarette to heat up the coil. You should not pull any vapor out of the e-cigarette, just get the e-cigarette primed for your first draw."

      "title": "Draw slowly and steadily on the e-cigarette.",
      "content": "Draw slowly and steadily on the e-cigarette. When you inhale, take a slow and steady draw until the vapor fills your mouth. Do not draw the vapor into your lungs, or swallow the vapor until the vapor has first filled your mouth."

      "title": "Hold the vapor for three to five seconds.",
      "content": "Hold the vapor for three to five seconds. Once you have held the vapor in your mouth for three to five seconds, you can then inhale it into your lungs. Then, exhale it slowly out of your nose or mouth. Unlike traditional cigarettes, you can absorb the nicotine from the e-cigarette into your body through the mucus membranes in your mouth, as well as your lungs and nose."

      "title": "Wait at least 30 seconds to feel the effects of the nicotine.",
      "content": "Wait at least 30 seconds to feel the effects of the nicotine. When smoking traditional cigarettes, you usually wait about eight seconds for the “hit” of nicotine. With e-cigarettes, nicotine absorption occurs more slowly through your mucus membranes and can take up to 30 seconds to “hit” you. Though you may need to get used to waiting a bit longer for your nicotine fix, it is easy to get used to after using the e-cigarette a few times. Some smokers crave a distinct hit of nicotine to the back of their throat and may feel that e-cigarettes do not provide a strong enough throat hit. Often the longer you drag on the e-cigarette, and the more vapor produced in your mouth, the stronger the throat hit will be. The flavoring in the e-liquid can also affect the amount of vapor produced. You may want to switch to a more tobacco-based flavor if you are seeking a stronger throat hit with your e-cigarette. As well, you may want to try an e-liquid with higher nicotine level for a more distinct throat hit. Keep in mind a higher nicotine level can lead to prolonged smoking and health issues like cancer and respiratory disease."
