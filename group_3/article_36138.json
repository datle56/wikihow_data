      "title": "Rub WD-40 on the body of your car.",
      "content": "Rub WD-40 on the body of your car. This oily substance will loosen the dead bugs and help them come off more easily. Apply it to your car's body with a rag or using a spray can and let it sit and soak in for about 10 minutes. Don't use WD-40 on your windshield or windows. It's an oily substance that will be very difficult to remove. Don't have WD-40? Try a different bug an tar removing product. Your local auto store should have a selection of products you can use to take off the bugs. As a bonus, this method works well to remove tar, too."

      "title": "Wipe or scrub off the bugs.",
      "content": "Wipe or scrub off the bugs. After the WD-40 has had time to soak in, use a towel to wipe off the bugs using a circular motion. Where necessary, you can scrub off the bugs with the towel. Be very careful not to scrub too hard, though, or you could damage your paint job. Don't use a tough sponge or steel wool pad to remove bugs from your car - it will scratch your paint. If you catch the bugs before they completely dry, one pass should be enough to clean them off. If the bugs have dried into the paint, you may need to clean the car once, then do another application of WD-40, let it soak in, and clean the car again."

A mixture of water and dish soap can often get the job done, but if you think you need a stronger solution you can find car window soap at an auto parts store. Spray your windshield and windows with soapy water. Let it soak in for 10 minutes. Scrub away the bugs. For the toughest spots, use a scrubbing sponge."

      "title": "Remove sap every few weeks.",
      "content": "Remove sap every few weeks. Sap tends build up into a thick, hard layer if you don't clean it off regularly. If your car tends to pick up a lot of sap, plan to clean it off every other week or so - more often in the summer, when it's more concentrated and will smear more easily. This will keep you from having a tougher job on your hands down the line. Be careful. Tree sap is soft, but it can also crystallize, and the crystals may end up scratching the surface just like glass."

Let the towel sit on the sappy area for at least 10 minutes. The alcohol will begin to break down and soften the hard sap."

Keep soaking and rubbing the sap until it's removed from your car's exterior. If the sap is difficult to remove, cover it with WD-40, which should help it loosen up. Don't use WD-40 on your windows, though. Don't use a scrubbing sponge or any other rough material to scrub the sap from your car's body, because the paint will likely come off with the sap."
