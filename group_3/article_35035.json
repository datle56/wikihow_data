      "content": "If a random person sends you money, it's likely a scam. Scammers send money using stolen cards and hacked Cash App accounts to strangers hoping they'll send the same amount back to them. After receiving the random deposit, you'll usually receive a payment request for the same amount you were sent, with a message that claims they've sent the money by accident. Do not fulfill this payment request . If you approve the payment request for the amount the scammer asks for, the money will be subtracted from your own bank account. At that point, the scammer will usually transfer your payment to their own card (or send it to another compromised Cash App account). When the owner of the stolen card or account used by the scammer finds that someone made a large transaction to Cash App, they'll dispute the charge through their bank, which then deducts the amount from your Cash App balance or bank account. So, the scammer will not only get the money you sent them, but you'll also have to refund the person whose account was stolen!"
