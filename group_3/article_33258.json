      "content": "Place your ante bet on the table and get 2 cards from the dealer. Think of an ante as an “entry fee” for the round. Since you aren’t playing against any opponent, your ante acts as the foundation for your future bets in the game. Once you’ve placed your ante bet, the dealer will hand you 2 cards. [2] X Research source Most Mississippi Stud players just put down a single chip as their ante bet. Some Mississippi Stud enthusiasts recommend having a pool of at least $400 to work with if you’re starting with a $10 ante."

      "content": "The dealer places 3 cards face-down in front of them. These are also known as “community cards”—think of them as an extension of your 2-card hand. You and any other players at the table will be using these community cards to get the best possible 5-card hand."

      "title": "Obtain at least 1 pair of face cards or aces in your hand to win a payout.",
      "content": "Obtain at least 1 pair of face cards or aces in your hand to win a payout. The smallest payout in Mississippi Stud goes to a pair of Jacks, Queens, Kings, or Aces. Of course, higher combos (like a two-pair, three-of-a-kind, straight, or flush) get you an even higher payout—a pair of face cards or Aces is just the minimum you need to earn money. Unlike other forms of poker, you don’t need to have a better hand than the other players to win the round. Anyone who has a least a pair of face cards or Aces gets paid!"

      "content": "Fold or make a 3rd Street wager based on the 2 cards in your hand. The first bet in a Mississippi Stud game is known as a “3rd Street” wager, where players can bet 1X, 2X, or 3X the ante bet they just put down. You also have the option to “fold,” or forfeit your bet for the round. [3] X Research source If you fold, you’ll lose the ante bet that you placed earlier. In a casino, there will be a special spot to place all of your bets, including your 3rd Street wager."

Do you think you can build a better card combo with future community cards? These are all important factors to keep in mind as more cards get entered into the game. [4] X Research source Let’s say you had a Jack of hearts and an 8 of spades in your hand. The dealer turns over the first community card, revealing a Jack of clubs. You might decide to play a little more aggressively in the next phase of the game since you’ve already scored a pair of Jacks."

Now that you’ve seen the first community card, it’s decision time—do you feel confident to keep betting on your hand, or is a good payout just not in the cards for this round? Place 1X, 2X, or 3X your ante bet in the designated spot, or fold for the rest of the round. [5] X Research source The later you decide to fold in the game, the bigger your losses will be."

      "content": "Royal Flush: 500 to 1 A royal flush is the rarest hand you can get in a round of Mississippi Stud, but it’s also the most valuable by far. A royal flush hand includes a 10, Jack, Queen, King, and Ace that all belong to the same card suit (either hearts, spades, clubs, or diamonds). For example, a 10 of diamonds, a Jack of diamonds, a Queen of diamonds, a King of diamonds, and an Ace of clubs would qualify as a regular straight, not a royal flush."

A pair of 2s and a pair of Jacks would earn you a 2-to-1 payout, even though 2s aren’t normally that valuable in Mississippi Stud."

There’s a chance that your face card could build into a valuable pair, straight, or flush, so it’s worth putting a small initial bet down. [11] X Research source As more community cards are flipped over, you can decide whether or not you’d like to increase your bet. If you have a 10 of hearts and a Queen of hearts and the 2 revealed community cards are a Jack of hearts and an Ace of hearts, you might bet a 3X ante on the chance that the third community card is a King of hearts (which would give you a royal flush)."

Unfortunately, 2, 3, 4, and 5 cards have almost no worth in a Mississippi Stud game, and it isn’t worth betting money on them. If you fold right away, you’ll only lose your ante bet (as opposed to any 3rd, 4th, or 5th Street bets you’d make later in the round).

Receiving a pair of low cards is the main exception to this rule (like a pair of 3s or 5s), since an initial pair gets you a better chance at a three-of-a-kind, which pays out 3 to 1. [13] X Research source Don’t bet aggressively on a pair of low cards! The odds of finding a matching community card are still pretty low, so you don’t want to bet 2X or 3X the ante on this type of hand. Feel free to bet 3X the ante on a pair of high-value cards, though (like a pair of 7s, 9s, or Jacks)."

Here are some general rules of thumb to follow using these point values: Put down a 1X bet on the 3rd Street wager when your initial hand is worth 2 points. Set a 1X bet on the 4th Street wager if your total hand is valued at 3 or more points. Place a 1X bet on the 5th Street wager if your current hand equals 4 or more points. [14] X Research source"

If the community cards create a winning hand, you’ll win money. [15] X Research source Your total winnings are decided by a separate, 3 Card Bonus payout table. The exact payouts may vary depending on the casino, but they usually look something like this: Mini Royal: 50 to 1 (3 cards of a royal flush) Straight Flush: 40 to 1 (3 sequential cards in the same suit) Three-of-a-kind: 30 to 1 Straight: 6 to 1 (3 sequential cards of different suits) Flush: 4 to 1 Pair: 1 to 1"
