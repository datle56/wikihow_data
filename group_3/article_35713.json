      "title": "Drink a lot of water.",
      "content": "Drink a lot of water. Try to drink at least 10 full glasses of water each day for a week after your sunburn. This will help your body to re-hydrate which will, in turn, aid in the healing process. Drinking water while you are out in the sun will also help you to avoid heatstroke and other heat-related medical conditions. [1] X Research source At the same time, make sure to avoid consuming any alcohol during your recovery period. This will only dehydrate you and dry out your skin even more. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Apply aloe vera.",
      "content": "Apply aloe vera. This is the traditional go-to remedy when dealing with a burn. The gel of the aloe vera plant has natural anti-inflammatory properties and can speed up the healing process if applied correctly. You can buy a store-brand product that contains aloe, but it is best to use the gel directly from a plant when possible to ensure there aren't any additional ingredients that will irritate your sunburn. [3] X Expert Source Mohiba Tareen, MD FAAD Board Certified Dermatologist Expert Interview. 26 March 2020. To remove the gel from a plant, break off a single full stem. Cut the stem open lengthwise. Open the stem and scrape out the gel using a spoon or your finger. Apply the gel to your skin between 2-3 times a day. [4] X Research source Even if you do not have the real aloe vera plant, you can still use the gel. Rub the gel onto your sunburn(s) at least 2-3 times a day, including before you go to sleep. For extra relief, you could also fill up an ice cube tray with aloe vera and freeze it, making aloe cubes that you can rub on your burn. (Wrap the cubes in a light hand towel before touching them to your skin). You can also apply aloe gel to your face in an overnight mask. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Create a baking soda paste. Get out a small bowl and mix equal parts baking soda and cornstarch. Add cool water until it reaches a thick enough consistency to apply to your skin.

      "content": "Use witch hazel. You can use the leaves and bark of the witch hazel plant for medicinal purposes. The “tannins” contained in witch hazel may help to repel bacteria and promote healing. Look for a vial of witch hazel extract at your local natural foods store. Use a cotton ball to apply the extract to your skin. [7] X Research source"

Get out a cup of plain, probiotic yogurt and apply a light coating to your burned skin using a cotton ball. Let the yogurt sit on your skin for around 5 minutes before wiping off with a clean damp towel. [8] X Research source"

      "title": "Wear loose and dark clothing.",
      "content": "Wear loose and dark clothing. Light, cotton garments that fall away from the skin are your best options during your recovery period. These items will let your skin breathe, preventing stagnation and lessening the possibility of infection. Stick to darker colors as they will draw less attention to your skin. Avoid whites and neon colors as they will create contrast with the redness, making it more noticeable. [9] X Research source"

      "content": "Use make-up to cover the redness. Apply a green-tinted primer to the burned areas to counterbalance the appearance of redness. Don't apply blush as it will only increase the red look. Use a light hand with make-up, however, as you can run the risk of skin irritation.

      "content": "Take pain medication. As soon as you get out of the sun, take an over-the-counter (OTC) anti-inflammatory medication, such as aspirin or ibuprofen. [11] X Expert Source Mohiba Tareen, MD FAAD Board Certified Dermatologist Expert Interview. 26 March 2020. Go ahead and ingest the highest recommended dose for at least the first 24 hours to kick-start the healing process. Keep taking the medication until the immediate discomfort from the burn has subsided. No matter how much pain you feel, it is critical that you follow the dosage instructions for OTC or prescription pain medications. Taking more than the proper dosage can cause serious medical injuries, such as liver damage. Read the label carefully to determine how many pills to take and at what intervals. Make sure that you are also aware of any possible pain medication side effects or drug interactions. These are often also listed on the bottle’s label or you can contact your doctor with any questions. For example, people with bleeding issues are often advised to avoid consuming Aspirin. You can also get a small bowl, drop one or two aspirin tablets into it, and crush them into a paste (adding a little water, if needed). Then, apply this paste to the most burned areas. Wipe off after a few minutes. However, for health safety reasons, do not crush and use more pills than the recommended dosage on the bottle or apply this paste while also taking a pain medication orally. [12] X Research source"

[14] X Expert Source Mohiba Tareen, MD FAAD Board Certified Dermatologist Expert Interview. 26 March 2020. You can also dip the cloth in whole cold milk.

For even more benefit, fill up a clean sock with 2 cups of uncooked oatmeal and tie it off at the end. Place the filled sock in the tub with you and squeeze it to release the juices. The oatmeal’s polysaccharides will coat and calm your skin. [16] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source You can also, of course, dump the raw oats directly into the tub with you, but expect more of a clean-up this way.

Resist this urge as that type of extreme cold can actually damage your skin, even more, killing the skin cells in the process. Instead, if you really want to use ice, wrap the cubes in a soft, clean washcloth before touching them to your skin."

Your dead skin will fall off in due time without your direct assistance. Forcibly exfoliating your skin too early can lead to scarring or infection. This is especially the case if you puncture any raised areas or sores. [19] X Research source Once your skin has returned to a close-to-normal color and is pain-free then you can spend some time exfoliating it with a soft sponge or scrubber."

If you see any pus coming from the burned areas, it can be a sign of possible infection. You can also see a doctor if your burn is simply making you miserable and the home remedies seem to have no effect. Depending on your specific situation, your doctor will most likely give you a corticosteroid cream. They may also prescribe an antibiotic if your burn shows signs of infection."

Get a sunscreen with a sun protection factor (SPF) of at least 50, the higher the better. Then, apply the cream to your skin at least 20 minutes before heading outside. This allows the sunscreen to begin working before you are actually exposed to the sun, thus preventing burning.

If you will be in the water, then you’ll want a sunscreen that is water-resistant. If you are hiking, you may need a sunscreen that includes insect repellant."
