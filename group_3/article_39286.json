      "content": "Remove your armpit hair. Most experts agree that many men don't need to bother removing all of their armpit hair. Typically, if you've got a lot of armpit hair, you should just trim it. If you want to remove it all for one reason or another, do so. Consider the following: If you're trimming, trim with a long attachment on a clipper. You can also do this with scissors. If you're going to shave it all off, trim first with a shorter attachment for a clipper. When you're done with the trimmer, moisten and apply shaving cream if you want. Use a razor to remove the left over hair. Moisturize afterward. Reader Poll: We asked 180 wikiHow readers if they use deodorant, and 53% of them said yes.

      "content": "Groom your arms. Men who wish to groom their arm and shoulder hair can also either shave it all off or just trim it. Tending to your arm and shoulder hair will compliment your overall look if you choose to go for a more bare and clean cut look. However, shaving your arms and shoulders should be done with care. Shave your shoulders and biceps bare. Start on the shoulder with a trimmer and no guard. As you move down toward your elbow, use longer guards. This is because most men won't want to completely shave their arm hair off. Make sure there are no hard hairlines when you are moving down from the biceps to the lower arm. When you're done with the trimmer, moisten your arms and apply shaving cream if you want. Use a razor to remove the left over hair. Moisturize afterward."

Both follow the general rules set forth on other parts of the body. If you're trimming, make sure you use a clipper with a moderate attachment. Start with a longer attachment, and move smaller until you find the desired length. Try to trim most excess hair off with a short attachment. Moisten and lather your skin. Take a razor and shave off the rest of the hair. Rinse and moisturize afterward."

      "content": "Groom your groin. The groin area – and all of the parts there – is the most complicated area to shave. A general rule is to take a moderate sized clipper guard and remove all of the excess hair that you can get with it. After this, you need to decide whether you are completely shaving, or just trimming. If you're trimming, just adjust to a smaller clipper guard and trim until you get to the desired length of hair. If you're shaving, you need to consider: Remove as much hair as you can with the shortest clipper guard possible. For hard to reach areas where you can't maneuver a clipper, use small scissors – be careful! After removing excess hair, moisten your skin with water. In order to get the rest of your hair, take a new/sharp razor and use slow and small strokes to remove the rest of the hair. Don't use shaving cream or lather as you might not be able to see the hair you need to remove. Moisturize afterward."

Take your clipper with no guard, and just shave everything off. Consider the following: You most likely don't need to use shaving cream, but you might want to moisten your skin with water. You'll need access to a large mirror so you can see those hard-to-reach places. You'll probably want a small mirror so you can maneuver it around to see harder-to-reach places. Make sure to lift your legs up so you can get all of your hair. Don't leave uncut swaths here and there – especially in that super-hard-to-reach place. Moisturize afterward."
