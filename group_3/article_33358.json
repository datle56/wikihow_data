      "content": "Stack up the tiles in groups of 7 and set them in easy reach. The stacks are traditionally 7 tiles tall, although you can make up your own rules for how many tiles to put in each stack. [2] X Research source Set 2-3 stacks directly in front of each player for easy access and arrange the rest in the middle of the table where everyone can draw from them as needed. If your game has a tile bag, you can leave them in that instead of stacking them on the table. You just need a common pool of tiles to draw from. You can also spread the tiles facedown across the center of the table between the players where everyone can see them."

For example, you can make a group of three 8s as long as the tiles are all different colors, such as blue, black, and red. You also can't have two or more tiles in a group in the same color, like two blue 8s with one black 8. They all have to be different!"

For instance, you can't play \"13, 1, 2.\" [4] X Research source"

[5] X Research source To play, just lay the tiles down on the table in front of you. Once they're there, anyone can move them around and play off of them."

You can make groups, runs, or both for your initial meld. You can't play off other sets on the board for your initial meld. You receive points based on the number on the tile. The color doesn't affect the number, so a blue 11 is worth the same number of points as an orange 11. A Joker is worth the number of points on the tile it's replacing."

You can add tiles to runs or groups, as long as you follow the basic rules of these sets. For instance, if there's a run of \"3, 4, 5\" in blue, you can add a blue 2, a blue 1 and 2, a blue 6, a blue 6 and 7, a blue 2 and 6, etc. to continue the set. If there's a group of a red 6, blue 6, and black 6, you can add an orange 6. However, you couldn't add a blue, black, or red 6 unless you manipulate the set by taking a tile to build another set."

[8] X Research source For example, if there's a set on the table that's a run of \"5, 6, 7, 8\" in red, and you need the red 8 to complete a set of three 8s, you can take it.

In some games, you may be able to pick up the Joker only if you can use 2 tiles from you hand to form a new set with the Joker. In other versions, you can split or manipulate a set with a Joker.
