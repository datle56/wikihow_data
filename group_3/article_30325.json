      "content": "Reduce shine. If your nose is shiny and oily, it will attract more attention. If you feel self-conscious about your upturned nose, more attention may be the last thing that you want. Reducing shine will help minimize the attention that is drawn to your nose. Try oil-absorbing sheets or wipes. For example, the company Clean & Clear makes oil absorbing sheets that soak up excess oil without smudging makeup or leaving behind traces of powder. They come in small, portable packs and are an easy solution for an oily or shiny nose. Use a matte foundation. A matte foundation, especially one designed for use on oily skin, can help reduce the shine around your nose. You can choose between a liquid or powder foundation, but the most important thing is to find one that reduces shine. For example, Nars makes a mattifying, sheer foundation that helps to control shine and even skin tone."

      "content": "Keep skin healthy. Acne, especially if it is located mainly on or around your nose, can draw more attention to your upturned nose than you would like. An easy way to make any kind of nose look good is by taking care of your skin. Use an anti-acne face wash. Neutrogena, Clean & Clear, Cetaphil, L’Oreal, and Garnier all make anti-acne face washes that can be found easily at most drugstores or grocery stores. Follow the instructions on the bottle, which usually include washing your face twice a day and following up with a light, oil-free moisturizer. Look for face washes with benzoyl peroxide, which kills acne-causing bacteria, reduces inflammation, and helps to clear blocked pores. [2] X Research source As an alternative, look for face washes with salicylic acid, which helps to unclog pores and correct the abnormal shedding of cells. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Even skin tone. If you have an uneven skin tone, certain parts of your face, such as your upturned nose, may be more noticeable. Luckily, evening out your skin tone is easily achieved. For short term improvement, you can apply a concealer or foundation. Concealers and foundation can be found to match your natural skin tone, and with correct use, no one will notice that you are wearing makeup. Try MAC Studio Finish SPF 35 Concealer- it comes in eight different skin tones and offers SPF protection as well. For a long term solution, you can look into getting a laser treatment or having a microdermabrasion session. These professional treatments will help remove dead skin and discoloration and will often result in a significant improvement to the evenness of your skin tone. These treatments require a visit to a dermatologist or skincare professional."

      "content": "Draw attention to your eyes. You can use eyeliner, accentuated lashes, and eye shadow to emphasize your eyes, which will make your upturned nose less noticeable on your face. [4] X Research source Making your eyes look bigger will make your nose look smaller in comparison. Consider using eyeliner to make a “cat eye” look, which is a dramatic way to draw attention to your eyes. Several coats of mascara can lengthen and emphasize your eyelashes; in addition, an eyelash curler can enhance the effects of your mascara. If you really want to go for a dramatic look, apply false eyelashes, which can add length and volume to your normal eyelashes. A dramatic “smoky eye,” created by a combination of dark eyeshadows (think blues, browns, greys) can also make your eyes the focal point of your face. Try to work with eyeshadow that will draw out the natural color of your eyes to make them stand out. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Draw attention to your lips.",
      "content": "Draw attention to your lips. If you feel like your lips are a strong feature on your face, accentuating them with color or shine will draw attention away from your upturned nose and make your lips the focal point of your face. Select a lipstick color that enhances your lips. Choose a bright red, a dark color (such as maroon), or a bright pink. This is certain to make your lips your focal feature! Wear lip gloss. If you don’t want to make a dramatic statement with lip color, try wearing a shiny coat of gloss on your lips. This will also draw attention away from your upturned nose and is more suitable for situations where wearing a bright lip color would not be appropriate, such as in many workplaces."

      "content": "Get a flattering haircut. A haircut is a great way to change the appearance of your nose. People with upturned noses can often pull off a short and/or shaggy hairstyle. Talk to your hair stylist and explain your desire to hide your upturned nose as much as possible. As they are hair professionals, he or she may have a recommendation for a hair style that will flatter your hair type and texture as well as reduce the appearance of your upturned nose. Consider getting layers or messy bangs. If your hair looks like it’s meant to be covering parts of your face, your upturned nose will be less noticeable; plus, these hairstyles are very fashionable today!"

      "content": "Try contouring . Contouring involves strategically placing dark or light color foundation or powder on your skin in order to make particular features recede and others become more prominent. [6] X Expert Source Frankie Sanderson Makeup Artist & Stylist Expert Interview. 14 April 2020. Do a Google search for “facial contouring,” or watch “contouring with makeup” videos on YouTube to see the best tips and tricks for accentuating the natural features of your face. You will need to buy a foundation 2-3 shades darker than your skin tone (either powder or cream) for creating contour, as well as a foundation 2-3 shades lighter than your skin tone (either powder or cream) for highlighting. If you want to minimize your upturned nose, draw a line with contour powder/cream down each side of your nose. Next, draw a down-facing arrow with contour cream/powder once you get to the tip of your nose, creating the illusion of a slimmer nose tip. Finally, draw a slender line with highlighter powder/cream down the center of your nose. [7] X Expert Source Frankie Sanderson Makeup Artist & Stylist Expert Interview. 14 April 2020. Don’t forget to blend your contouring well before leaving the house! Looking at your contouring in different types of light can help minimize the appearance of makeup on your face."

      "content": "Tilt your chin down slightly. If your chin is tilted down slightly, your upturned nose will be much less obvious, and people will not be able to see inside your nostrils. Tilting your chin down can also be an effective way of turning the focus onto your eyes and can help make your face look more slender as well. Practice your head tilt in the mirror. You want to make this head tilt look natural, and not forced. If you practice while looking in the mirror, you can find an angle at which to hold your head that minimizes the appearance of your nose and still looks comfortable."

      "content": "Smile, but not too widely. Smiling widely will make your nose appear wider, and your nostrils appear wider as well. Controlling your smile can be an especially useful trick for when you wish to draw attention away from your upturned nose in photos. Maintain white teeth. If your teeth are healthy and pearly white, they will receive more attention than your upturned nose. This will also enhance your smile, drawing more focus to your mouth."
