DAT files, which end in a “.dat” extension, are generic data files that can be created by almost any computer program. [1] X Research source According to Meshesha, most of these files contain simple text. However, some may contain other types of data, such as images, video, or sound."

      "content": "You’re most likely to see DAT files as email attachments on Mac. While many programs on your Mac can generate .dat or .data files, you’ll typically encounter them as email attachments, often with the name “winmail.dat” or “ATT0001.dat.” This may happen if someone sends you an email message with an attachment that your computer or email app can’t read. For example, this is a common error in Apple Mail, which has trouble interpreting files sent in Outlook’s proprietary TNEF format. [2] X Research source This can also happen when someone sends you an email in RTF (Rich Text) format and your mail app can’t interpret it. In these cases, the DAT file may simply contain the text of the message they were trying to send you. If you see one of these files attached to an email, don’t try to open it unless you trust the sender. If you do, ask them if they intended to send an attachment with their email. If not, ask them to send future messages in HTML or plain text instead of RTF format to prevent this from happening."

However, if the .dat file contains some other type of data, such as an image or a video, you’ll need a different app to open it. For example, some .dat files contain PDF data and can be opened with a program like Preview or Adobe Acrobat. Your Mac may suggest an appropriate app for opening the file if you Ctrl -click or right-click it and select Open With ."

You may be able to read the text to ascertain what program the DAT file is used in or to read its contents to see if it was originally an email message formatted as RTF. If TextEdit cannot open the DAT file, it isn't a text-based file. You probably won’t see TextEdit as an option if your DAT file doesn’t contain text. In these cases, you might see something like VLC, Preview, or QuickTime instead. Some DAT files are locked and cannot be manipulated."

To start, right-click or Ctrl-click the file and select Open With > Text Edit (or your text editor of choice). This will work best if the data in the file is comma- or tab-separated.
