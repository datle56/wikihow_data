The person with the next highest card can choose any seat, and so on. The person to the left of the dealer goes first. [1] X Research source In some variations, the first player is chosen once the cards are dealt, and it's based on the lowest card that is face-up."

Typically, higher cards are better to place face-up. One variant has the dealer place 3 of the cards face-up on top of the original 3 face-down cards. This makes the game a bit harder, as you can't place easy-to-play cards face-up. [3] X Research source"

That will be the starting card for the discard pile, and the player to the left of the dealer will play on it to start the game. [5] X Research source One variation says the first player with a face-up 3 starts the game by playing a card from their hand. [6] X Research source If no one has a 3, it moves to 4s. Another variation says the person to the left the dealer plays the lowest card in their hand. As an example, say the starting card is a 6."

You can actually play multiple cards, as long as they're all equal to or higher and of the same rank. [7] X Research source You can use any higher card, but it's smarter to play your lower cards first. For instance, if the starting card is the 6 of hearts, you can play a 6 of spades, a 7 of diamonds, or a king of clubs. You could also play 2 6s or 3 8s. The cards are ranked with the ace as the highest and the 3 as the lowest. The 2 is a special card that resets the deck."

In some variations, if you draw a card that's the same number as the last card you played on the pile, you can play it. This rule only applies if the next player hasn't added a card yet.

In some variations, anyone can jump in to finish 4 of a kind. For instance, if the dealer plays 3 7s, someone across the table can play 1 7 to complete 4 of a kind, even if it's not their turn.
