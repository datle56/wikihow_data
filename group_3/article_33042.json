      "content": "Get a bocce ball set . A standard bocce set typically contains 4 green balls and 4 red balls. It also includes a smaller ball, called the pallino, also known as the pallino or jack . Bocce balls come in different sizes based on skill levels. Use smaller bocce balls if you’re a beginner or playing with children. Stick to regulation-size bocce balls with a diameter of 107 mm (4.2 inches) and weight of 920 g (~2 lbs) if you want to play more professionally."

[1] X Research source If you play with 3 players per team, then one person will get to go twice each round, or frame. Avoid playing with teams of 5 or more because not everyone will get to throw bocce balls during the frame. If your bocce ball set comes with 4 different colors, give each team all the balls with the same pattern engraved in their surface."

      "content": "Play on or set up a bocce court. Play on a constructed bocce court for the most official game. If you don’t have access to a court, then find a flat grassy area and stake the corners of the court. [2] X Research source Mark a foul line about 3 meters (10 ft) from the ends of the court if they aren’t already there. Players cannot step past the foul line when they toss a bocce ball. Place a regulator peg in the exact center of the court to mark the halfway point. This marks the minimum distance players have to toss the pallino during each round. If you don’t have a peg, just have all the players agree on how far everyone needs to throw the ball. If you want to build a bocce court , regulation sizes are a maximum of 4 meters (13 feet) wide and a maximum of 27.5 meters (90 feet) long. Give your bocce court a raised barrier that’s about 20 cm (~8 in) high."

If the team fails to get the pallino across half-court or crosses the foul line during their throw, the other team tosses the pallino instead. [4] X Research source In some professional or tournament games, you must toss the pallino so it lands in a 5 m (16 ft) zone that ends 2.5 m (8 ft) from the far end of the court If you're not playing bocce on a court, throw the pallino wherever you want. Just be sure to decide on a minimum distance with the other players."

Try to get the bocce ball as close to the pallino as possible. [5] X Research source If the bocce ball hits the back wall of the court or goes out of bounds without touching the pallino, then it’s considered a dead ball and removed from the court. If a player crosses the foul line during their toss, then they lose their turn and the other team gets to go instead."
