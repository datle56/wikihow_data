      "content": "Rubbing alcohol Even the most stubborn permanent marker stains are no match for the powers of isopropyl (rubbing) alcohol. Simply pour some rubbing alcohol directly onto the stain and use your fingertips or a paper towel to rub it onto the marker. [1] X Research source Continue rubbing the mark until all the ink is gone. Finish off by washing your skin with warm water and a bit of soap. Use a rag or towel you don’t mind getting dirty. Permanent marker will stain your rag just like it stained your skin."

      "title": "Coconut oil",
      "content": "Coconut oil Tareen tells us that coconut oil is an effective stain remover, plus it gives your skin a little extra sweet-smelling moisture. Wash your skin with warm water and a little bit of soap, and pat it dry. Apply a small amount of the coconut oil to your marked skin with your hands. Rub and wipe the coconut oil against your skin with your fingers or a tissue until the marker is completely gone. You may need to rinse the oil off with warm water, then reapply it several times before the stain is gone. Olive oil is also an effective alternative."

[2] X Research source Squirt some hand sanitizer onto your hand, and then rub it onto the mark using a circular motion for 30-60 seconds. Rinse your skin off with warm water, and repeat the process until you've conquered the stain. As a bonus, your skin will be germ free! Or, use cleansing wipes that contain alcohol as an alternative to using hand sanitizer."

Then, wash off your squeaky-clean skin with warm water and pat dry. Nail polish remover evaporates fairly quickly, so you may have to use multiple applications."

When most of the ink has been dissolved, wash your skin off with soap and a bit of warm water and pat it dry. Note that hairspray may irritate sensitive skin.

      "content": "No, permanent ink isn’t dangerous for your skin. If you accidentally get a few marks on your skin, don’t worry! While it should never be ingested, it only sits on top of your skin, and won’t cause negative symptoms for most people. That said, you probably shouldn’t make a habit of writing on yourself in Sharpie, since they are considered toxic. [12] X Research source If you have sensitive skin, permanent marker ink may cause mild reactions, like rash or itchiness. Consult a doctor if this occurs. Permanent marker fumes are also toxic. Avoid intentionally inhaling permanent marker ink. If you do want to write on your skin, opt for washable children’s marker’s, which often contain zero toxic ingredients."
