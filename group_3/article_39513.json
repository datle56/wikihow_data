      "content": "Set the washer and dryer to their hottest settings. Heat is what actually makes the fibers in your shirt contract, so be sure to set your washer and dryer on their hottest settings to get the best effect. For a dryer, the hottest setting is usually permanent press. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Wash the shirt alone.",
      "content": "Wash the shirt alone. Pull your shirt inside out and wash it by itself. This will help preserve the color and design, and washing alone will make sure that nothing else gets accidentally shrunk! [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Put it in the dryer immediately.",
      "content": "Put it in the dryer immediately. As soon as the wash cycle ends, take your shirt out and put it right into the dryer. Let it dry for an entire cycle, even if the sensor tells you the shirt is already dry. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Repeat if necessary.",
      "content": "Repeat if necessary. Try your shirt on to see how much it shrunk. If it's still not small enough, you may need to repeat the cycle a few more times until you reach the size you want."

    {
      "title": "Boil a large pot of water.",
      "content": "Boil a large pot of water. You'll need a pot large enough for your shirt to float around in, so use the biggest pot you have. Fill it about 2/3 of the way--if you overfill it, water might seep out when you put the shirt in. Let the water get to a rolling boil. [4] X Research source You can put white vinegar into the water if your shirt also needs to be cleaned."

      "title": "Roll your shirt into a ball.",
      "content": "Roll your shirt into a ball. Pull your shirt inside out to prevent fading, and roll it into a loose ball. Be sure not to tie it into a knot--it will shrink unevenly!"

      "content": "Use tongs to lower it into the water. To prevent scalding, lower your shirt gently into the water using a pair of tongs. Don't just toss it in the water. Fabric coming in contact with the burner can start a fire."

    {
      "title": "Leave your shirt in the water for at least five minutes.",
      "content": "Leave your shirt in the water for at least five minutes. Let your shirt sit in the boiling water for at least five minutes. The longer you keep it in there, the more likely it is to shrink, but don't keep it in the water for more than half an hour. You'll risk damaging the fibers. [5] X Research source Be sure that the entire shirt is immersed."

      "title": "Remove the shirt carefully.",
      "content": "Remove the shirt carefully. Turn the heat off and use a pair of tongs to pull your shirt out. Do this carefully to avoid burning yourself. Hold the shirt over the pot until it stops dripping, then move it away. Let it cool for about five minutes or until it's cool enough to handle. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Lie it flat on a rack to dry. Set up a drying rack and spread your shirt out on it to dry. The rack can be inside or outside, but an outside rack will usually dry faster. If you dry it outside, be sure to turn the shirt inside out to prevent the sun from fading it. [7] X Research source Don't hang your shirt--it will stretch where the clothespins are attached."

      "content": "Heat about 2 cups (0.47 l) of water. You can use a microwave or a stove to heat the water up, or you can use hot water from the tap. The water should be very warm but not hot--don't let it get close to boiling! You should be able to comfortably put a finger in the water. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Spray the parts of the shirt you want to shrink. Be sure not to spray the entire shirt--just the parts you want to shrink. This is usually the sleeves or neckline for most people. Spray the shirt enough to get it wet to the touch in the areas you want to shrink. You can also run the areas under a hot tap, but be careful not to wet the whole shirt."

      "title": "Transfer to a hot dryer immediately.",
      "content": "Transfer to a hot dryer immediately. Put the shirt in a dryer on permanent press and let it run through the entire cycle. Some people like to take it out of the dryer and repeat the spraying every ten minutes or so, but this is optional."

      "title": "Repeat if necessary.",
      "content": "Repeat if necessary. If the shirt doesn't fit right when you try it on, repeat the whole cycle. Since spot-shrinking uses cooler water than other methods, you'll probably need to do this at least twice."
