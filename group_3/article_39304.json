      "content": "Choose a sharp, clean razor—or a brand-new one, if possible. Make sure your razor is clean and as sharp as possible—a brand new razor is preferable. [1] X Research source Using a dull or dirty razor can drag across your skin, leading to problems like ingrown hairs, razor burn, and in severe cases, infection. While using razors with multiple blades will work, some experts recommend using a razor with just one or two blades, as they remove the hair with fewer passes over the skin. If you aren’t using a brand-new razor, be sure to rinse it off first to make sure it isn’t clogged with dead skin or hair. It’s usually better to use a sturdy, reusable razor than a disposable one."

      "content": "Trim the hair before shaving. Trimming your bikini line ahead of time can make shaving a lot easier, as it helps prevent skin irritation and keeps your razor from getting clogged as easily. Use electric trimmers or a pair of small bikini scissors to trim the hair to about 1/4 inch (6 mm). Pull the hair toward you and cut it into small sections. It doesn’t have to be even; it just has to be short. [2] X Research source If you use an electric trimmer , make sure it doesn’t have rotating heads, as these can pull the hair and cause pain."

      "title": "Exfoliate and moisturize the skin.",
      "content": "Exfoliate and moisturize the skin. Before shaving, stand in the shower for at least 10 minutes so the warm water softens the hair and skin, making it easier to shave. Use a gentle, physical exfoliant (like a washcloth or exfoliating glove ) to remove dead skin cells and ingrown hairs, allowing for a closer shave. [3] X Research source It’s okay to use a chemical exfoliant, as well, but make sure the ingredients are gentle enough to use on sensitive skin. Many experts recommend physical exfoliants instead. If you want to shave but can’t take a shower, take a wet washcloth and leave it on the area for 5-10 minutes. Cosmetologist Dedra Allen says to get the closest shave, “Make sure to exfoliate regularly and trim the hair down prior to shaving.”"

      "content": "Apply shaving cream or gel. Always use shaving cream or gel when shaving your bikini line. Choose a good quality product with moisturizing ingredients (like shea butter or coconut oil) and apply it evenly across the area you intend to shave. If you don’t have shaving cream, a creamy body wash or hair conditioner can work in a pinch. [4] X Research source It's best to use unscented shaving cream designed for the bikini area. If you have particularly sensitive skin, test an area before you apply it all over."

      "title": "Shave with the grain.",
      "content": "Shave with the grain. Because the skin on the bikini area is very sensitive, it can become irritated very easily. To help prevent this, it’s important to shave with the grain in the direction the hair is growing. In the case of the bikini area, this means shaving down, away from your belly button. [5] X Research source When you’re shaving your bikini line between your thighs, shave downward and from the outside in. This means if you’re shaving the left side of your bikini area, shave from left to right. When shaving between your thighs, bend at the waist and raise one leg so you can see where you’re shaving. This will be easier if you have a bench of some sort in your shower. Prop your leg on the shower wall or sink if you need to—just be careful!"

Remember that each pass of the razor removes surface skin, too, so try to make as few passes as possible. It also helps to pull the skin taut so the blade passes over the area more easily.

Rinse the area with warm water, then pat the skin dry with a soft towel. Don’t rub the area vigorously, as this may irritate the delicate skin. It’s just been through a lot! [7] X Research source A sugar scrub at this point can work wonders. However, if your skin is very sensitive, it may be better to use a more gentle exfoliant. If you notice any stray hairs at this point, grab a pair of tweezers to put the finishing touches on the area. Sometimes, you can spend what seems like hours shaving down there and still miss a few.

Then, apply a moisturizer (like a fragrance-free body lotion or a post-shave serum ) to further soothe the skin. [8] X Research source Natural anti-inflammatories like tea tree oil also work well. Ingredients like aloe vera, jojoba oil, and vitamin E are good for hydrating the skin. Applying a bit of baby powder or baby lotion can also reduce irritation.
