Shuffle up the deck of character cards really well and then deal out 2 cards facedown to each player. There are 5 influence cards in Coup: the Duke, the Assassin, the Captain, the Ambassador, and the Contessa. Each has its own special abilities and there are 2 copies in the deck. The dealer can play and deal cards during the game. Each player is allowed to look at their cards once they get them."

So it’s super important that you keep your 2 character cards facedown and hidden at all times. Keep your coins on the table near you so other players can see how many you have. [2] X Research source If you have a certain number of coins, there are actions you’re required to take, so you can’t hide them from other players."

Have the person to the dealer’s left start off the game and choose an action. Each player is allowed to choose 1 action during their turn. Bluffing is a big part of playing Coup. The other players don’t know which character cards you have, so you can bluff and choose a special character action. But be careful! If another player calls your bluff and challenges you, it could cost you 1 of your character cards."

[5] X Research source After you choose foreign aid, you have to wait to see if another player wants to challenge it. If they don’t, then you’re good to go!
