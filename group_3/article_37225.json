Power down all of the devices completely before you unplug them from the outlets to avoid getting shocked or damaging your electronics. [1] X Research source When a GFCI outlet trips, the outlets on the same circuit will stop working as well so it’ll be easy to tell which ones are on the same circuit."

      "content": "Press the “Reset” button on the outlet until you hear a click. Look for the red “Reset” button on the front of the outlet between the sockets. Gently push the button in and listen for a click to signal that the outlet has reset. [2] X Research source If the GFCI outlet doesn’t have buttons, then it’s connected to a different GFCI outlet on the same circuit. Check around the same room or area of your home to see if there’s a GFCI outlet that has a “Reset” button."

      "content": "Try using appliances or electronics connected to the outlet. Once you plug something into the outlet, turn it on to see if it has power. Plug the rest of your devices into the outlets on the circuit one at a time so you don’t overload the circuit. [3] X Research source If your GFCI outlet trips again and you lose power to the outlets, you may be plugging too many things into the circuit. If nothing turns on when you plug it in, then you may have to reset the breaker."

      "content": "Unplug any devices connected to the outlet and circuit. Since your devices could overload the circuit and make it trip again, pull the plugs out of the sockets while you’re resetting the breaker. All of the outlets on the same circuit will lose power once the breaker trips, so look around the room for any devices that are plugged in and aren’t receiving power. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Locate the tripped breaker in your home’s electrical box.",
      "content": "Locate the tripped breaker in your home’s electrical box. Look for the breaker box in your home, which is usually in a kitchen, basement, garage, or hallway. Look for the breaker switch that’s centered in its slot, which means that it’s been tripped and doesn’t have any power running through it. [5] X Research source Breakers are usually labeled with what rooms or appliances they control."

      "content": "Switch the breaker fully to the “Off” position. Even though the breaker tripped and lost power, it’s still not turned off completely. Your breaker won’t power up if you try pushing it into the “On” position right away, so reset the breaker by pushing it until it clicks into the “Off” position. [6] X Research source The direction you flip the switch depends on which way the breaker was installed. Always read the labels printed on the switch to know where the “On” and “Off” positions are."

If you’re able to power up your device, try plugging the rest of your things in one at a time and powering them on to see if the breaker trips again. [8] X Research source If the breaker still trips once you plug in your devices, you may have a faulty breaker or old wiring that can’t support using all of your electronics. Contact an electrician to help update your home’s electrical system. [9] X Research source"

If you have multiple GFCI outlets on the same circuit, only one of them tripping could turn the power off to the others. Check around the room for another GFCI outlet and try pressing the “Reset” button down. If you hear a click, then you found the one that was tripped. [10] X Research source Some homes are wired so multiple rooms are on the same circuit. If you can’t find another GFCI outlet in the room, check any other nearby rooms that share a wall."

      "title": "Try drying the electrical box with a hairdryer if there’s moisture present.",
      "content": "Try drying the electrical box with a hairdryer if there’s moisture present. GFCI outlets automatically trip when water gets inside of them. Start by turning the circuit switch off at the breaker box. Unscrew the outlet cover so you can access the electrical box. Plug a hairdryer into a separate outlet and turn it to the lowest setting. Wave the hairdryer over the electrical box and outlet until they’re completely dry, which will take a few minutes. Be careful not to hold the hairdryer too close to the wires since you could melt the plastic insulation."

      "content": "Secure any loose connections in the outlet’s wiring. Turn off the breaker that controls the outlet so you don’t get shocked. Unscrew the outlet cover and slowly pull the outlet from the wall. Give all of the wires connected to the outlet a light tug to make sure they have a firm connection. If they feel loose, be sure to tighten the screws or push them securely into the wire sockets. Gently screw the outlet back into place before turning the breaker back on and testing it. [11] X Research source Never handle wires while the breaker is still turned on since you could shock yourself. Check the wires with a non-contact voltage tester after turning off the circuit to make sure the wires aren’t live anymore."

Unscrew the old GFCI outlet from the wall and detach all of the wires that connect to it. Connect the wires to the screws on the new GFCI outlet before screwing it back in and testing it. [12] X Research source If there are only 2 or 3 wires in the electrical box, then connect the white wire to the silver LINE screw and the black wire to the brass LINE screw. If there’s a bare or green wire, connect it to the green ground terminal screw on the bottom of the outlet. If your electrical box has 2 cables each with 2–3 wires, the wires running back to the breaker connect to the LINE terminal screws at the top of the outlet and the ones carrying power to other GFCI outlets connect to the LOAD terminals on the bottom half of the outlet. Attach the black wires to the brass screws and white wires to silver screws. Then, secure the green or bare wires to the green ground terminal on the bottom of the outlet."

      "content": "Replace the circuit breaker if it’s faulty and not providing power. If your breaker doesn’t stay on or if there’s a burning smell near your electrical box, then it’s time to replace the breaker . Turn off the main breaker at the top of the panel to turn off all power to the box. Take the cover off of your breaker box and unscrew the wires connected to the breaker causing the problem. Hold onto the end of the breaker and pull it toward the middle of the breaker box to pop it out of place. Slot the bottom of the new breaker into the middle of the box and push it in until it clicks before securing the wires to the screws. [13] X Research source Always check the amp rating and voltage of the old breaker to ensure you get a new breaker that matches it. Take a picture of the breaker's label so you can easily reference it. Mark the breaker you’re replacing with a piece of painter’s tape since it can be hard to remember which one you’re changing once you remove the cover."
