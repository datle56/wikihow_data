      "content": "Get a microwave-safe container. You can find these almost anywhere, but chances are you already have one in your home. Some containers will have labels on their back which will tell you if they are safe to use in a microwave. Other labels which show that a container is safe to use in a microwave include: A symbol of a dish with wavy lines above it. A symbol with wavy lines."

      "content": "Crumble the wax into the bowl. Take the candle in your hand and break it up. If it's too difficult to break the candle with your hands, use a knife and slice the candle into smaller pieces. The smaller pieces should be much easier to break up with your hands."

      "title": "Place the bowl in the microwave and set the timer for 4 minutes.",
      "content": "Place the bowl in the microwave and set the timer for 4 minutes. The microwave won't melt the wax but it will make it much softer. For best results, leave the bowl uncovered when you place it in the microwave. This allows the heat to work more effectively on the wax."

      "title": "Take the bowl out and stir the wax while taking its temperature.",
      "content": "Take the bowl out and stir the wax while taking its temperature. Make sure you're familiar with the flash point of your wax, the temperature it will ignite at. Use a standard thermometer to check the temperature of the wax. If the wax is too hot, let it cool down until it reaches a safe temperature again. You can use the prongs of a fork to press the wax into the side of the bowl and break it up which will make it melt faster in the microwave. Be careful to not get any of the wax on your skin. You can find the flash point of your wax on the side of its container or packaging. Your wax should always be at least 30–50 °F (−1–10 °C) below its flash point."

    {
      "title": "Place the bowl in the microwave at 1 minute intervals.",
      "content": "Place the bowl in the microwave at 1 minute intervals. Keep your eye on the wax while it's in the microwave. If at any point you think the wax is getting too hot, take it straight out of the microwave. Keep taking the temperature and don't put the wax back in if it's too hot. When the wax is completely melted, you're finished. Once you're careful and keep a watchful eye on your wax, you shouldn't encounter any problems."

      "content": "Find the melting point of your wax and preheat the oven to that temperature. The melting point of your wax should be detailed on the side of the candle container or packaging. Make sure you use the melting point and not the flash point of the wax. [1] X Research source The flash point is the temperature the wax will ignite at. You can find the flash point of your wax on the side of its container or packaging. Your wax should always be at least 30–50 °F (−1–10 °C) below its flash point."

      "title": "Place your wax in the oven once it's heated.",
      "content": "Place your wax in the oven once it's heated. When the oven reaches the right temperature, place your wax in in a baking tray. It should take around 10 minutes for the wax to completely turn to liquid at the right temperature. Keep an eye on the wax. The oven is a little more dangerous than the microwave so it's important to keep your eye on it. Be especially vigilant with a gas oven. Once the wax turns to liquid, it will become much more flammable and won't have any problems finding a flame in a gas oven."

      "title": "Check the wax at 2 minute intervals.",
      "content": "Check the wax at 2 minute intervals. Every couple of minutes, use oven gloves to take the wax and its container from the oven. Take the temperature of the wax using a standard thermometer."

      "title": "Use an electric stove if possible.",
      "content": "Use an electric stove if possible. Using a stove top is the most dangerous of all of the melting methods. An electric stove is safer than gas but still quite risky. You should only use this method if you have plenty of experience with melting wax and candles. [2] X Research source This method should not be used by a novice or someone who has completed the other methods a few times. Find out the flash point of the wax you're using. The flash point is the temperature the wax will ignite at. You can find the flash point of your wax on the side of its container or packaging. Your wax should always be at least 30–50 °F (−1–10 °C) below its flash point."

All you need is a deep, wide pan and a large glass or metal bowl that will fit into the pan. [3] X Research source Ideally, you want as much of the bowl in the pan as possible as this will more evenly distribute the heat."

      "content": "Place the bowl with the wax in it into the pan. Once the water in the pan has reached boiling point, place the wax in. The boiling water will heat the bowl quickly but won't burn the wax. This will also reduce the chances of a fire. Remember to use your thermometer to frequently take the temperature of the wax in the bowl. [5] X Research source If the wax gets close to its flash point, use oven gloves to remove the large bowl from the pan. Give the wax some time to cool down before placing it back into the pan. Turn the heat down on the stove top."
