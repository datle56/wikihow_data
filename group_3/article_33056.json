      "content": "Understand the objective. Usually, your goal in Candy Crush Saga is to clear as many rows and columns as possible in as few moves as possible. You can clear candy pieces from the board by lining up three (or more) in a row, which is accomplished by swapping pieces of candy in order to create three of a kind. The initial objective of Candy Crush Saga is to earn a certain number of points within a certain number of moves. As you proceed through Candy Crush Saga, other objectives (such as reaching a certain score within a time limit or clearing all of a type of candy from the board) will become more common."

It can also make available some perks and boosters for your completed levels. Losing a Candy Crush Saga game causes the level to reset, and you'll also lose a life. While lives automatically regenerate once every ~30 minutes or so, you can only have 5 lives at a time without paying for extra."

While matching 3 candies in a row will clear them from the board, matching more will both clear the candies from the board and create a special candy that can be used to clear additional candies: If you match 4 candies, a special candy will be created which will burst an entire row if matched as part of another set of 3 or more. If you match 5 or more candies in a T or L shape, you will create a wrapped candy. These explode the square of candies surrounding that tile (when matched) and then explode a subsequent 3x3 block wherever they settle. If you match 5 candies in a single row, you’ll a color bomb which resembles a chocolate with sprinkles. When swapped with another candy, color bombs remove all instances of the swapped candy from the board."

There are boosters which add moves—such as the lollipop hammer (which crushes the desired candy on the board) and the shuffle candy (which will rearrange the board)—among a number of other boosters. They should be explained as you earn them, though almost all you will have to buy."
