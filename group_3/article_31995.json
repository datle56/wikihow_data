Figure out what kind of exposure to rats leads you to fear. [2] X Research source Only by positively identifying the circumstances in which you feel fear can you work to overcome it. Consider where your fear came from. It may have been caused by a specific, traumatic event involving a rat, or maybe you have a lot of information about the dangers of rats.

[4] X Research source Perhaps a friend has a pet rat, and you want to be able to visit him without feeling overly anxious. Giving yourself a goal to work towards will give you something clear to accomplish, and can help keep you focused on achieving it. Identifying what kind of interaction you want with rats will help you figure out how comfortable you need to be. For example, if you are just trying to remain confident around your home, you don't need to be comfortable petting or touching rats, just remaining calm if you see one."

      "title": "Determine if you are suffering from fear or a phobia.",
      "content": "Determine if you are suffering from fear or a phobia. Fear is a common emotional reaction to a threat, whether it's real or just in your imagination. Fear is something you will likely be able to overcome with some effort, and perhaps help from friends. Phobias, on the other hand, cause uncontrollable panic and dread when you are confronted with the thing you fear. A serious phobia can be much tougher to overcome, and will probably need help from a therapist to get past. [5] X Research source A phobia does not need to come from simply tensing up when you see a rat. Consider the symptoms you feel when facing a rat, and how rats (or the possibility of rats) may be impacting your life. Even if you don't see actual rats to cause anxiety, you may find yourself avoiding places or situations where rats could be present. If you are rerouting your life in this way to avoid even the possibility of seeing a rat, that could be a sign of phobia as well. [6] X Research source"

You want to reach a point where the sight of rats doesn't cause you fear or anxiety, especially when it is an image, and not an actual rat. This first step in exposing yourself to rats like this is part of exposure therapy, a common method for dealing with fears and phobias.

      "title": "Get close to rats.",
      "content": "Get close to rats. If you are comfortable looking at rats, you should try to get physically closer to them. A controlled environment, like a pet store or a friend's house, is a good place for this. Watch the rats in their cages while they eat, sleep, play, or do whatever else it is rats do. You can be more confident knowing there is a case or cage between you and the rat. One way this can work is to slowly increase the time you spend watching them. Start with just a couple of minutes, especially if you feel your anxiety coming on. Build your time up from there, until you can handle being around the rats without worrying about the clock."

      "content": "Handle a rat. Now you'll get really close, and start touching the rats. Start with petting one, perhaps while a friend holds it. If you feel really comfortable, you can move up to holding one yourself. Just be careful, rats are smaller than you are, and you can hurt them if you squeeze hard or drop them. [9] X Research source Wearing gloves the first time can help you gradually get more acclimated to holding a rat. Also, the rat may bite if it gets nervous or is temperamental, so this can help protect your fingers and avoid contributing to your phobia."

      "content": "Work with the therapist to think about your fears. This is called Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT). Your therapist will likely give you homework assignments, where you will be thinking, writing, and talking about your fear of rats. As your therapist helps you to understand the irrationality of your fear, he will also slowly expose you to the thing you are afraid of. You will begin to learn acceptable behaviors that may bring you close to your fear, but won't expose you to anything actually dangerous. [13] X Research source"

      "content": "Take medication as prescribed. Your phobia may be too strong, making behavior medication the best option. These could come in the form of beta-blockers, which reduce the flow of adrenaline into your body, antidepressants, which block the chemical production in your brain to regulate behavior, or sedatives, which will help you relax. Follow the dosage and treatment time as given by your therapist, which should help to see if the drugs help as intended. [14] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source When you discuss drugs, make sure you tell your therapist all other medications you are taking. Ask about how long it should take to feel the effects, and what the side effects may be. It can be a good idea to get an after-hours number for your doctor in case you develop troublesome side effects. Like many prescription drugs, these can be very addictive, especially sedatives, and should be taken only under your therapist's supervision."

These could include a variety of meditation and relaxation techniques, including yoga, traditional Chinese medical practices like acupuncture, or natural herbal supplements. These treatments can be helpful in reducing general anxiety, which may make it easier to confront your fears, like rats. [15] X Research source"
