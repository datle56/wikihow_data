Open the dog’s mouth, pull the tongue towards you, and look in the back of the throat. If you see something, carefully try to remove it with your fingers.

[3] X Research source Count the pulses for 15 seconds and then multiply that number by 4. This is the number of heartbeats per minute. [4] X Research source Small and medium-sized dogs should have a pulse of 70 to 140 beats per minute. Large dogs should have a pulse of 50 to 120 beats per minute. Only perform CPR if you can’t feel or hear a dog’s heartbeat and it's not breathing.
