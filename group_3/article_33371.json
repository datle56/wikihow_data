      "content": "Learn the bass note riff at the center of the song to guide your playing. This iconic set of notes begins the song and is played on the bass. [1] X Research source The exact same riff is repeated through the verse and chorus, though Jack White plays the notes as power chords on the guitar. If you can learn the basic riff, however, you can easily add the chords in later. Using guitar tablature , the bass riff looks like: G|-------------------------------------| D|----------5--------------------------| A|--7--7------7-5-3-2-----------| E|--0----------------------------------| In the song's original version, this is only a bass guitar riff. But you can crank up your amp’s distortion or use an octave pedal to mimic the sound on an electric guitar."

      "content": "Slide your index finger around the neck to play the notes. Get used to moving your whole hand fluidly across the guitar to master the above riff. Use your index finger to fret (or hold down all 6 strings) as much as possible instead of switching fingers – you'll need your ring and pinkie free to make chords later on. Listen closely to the White Stripes’s recording to hear Jack White sliding his hand on the guitar neck to play the notes. It’s most pronounced right before he launches into the riff as he slides into the 7th fret note (or the 3rd note in the riff). [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Learn the guitar chords for the verse. If you were to play the song with just an acoustic guitar, for example, you'd need to know the chord melodies (the chords that mimic the notes of the song’s melody). But these chords could also be used for any cover – look at Marcus Collins's version, which uses rhythm guitar in the verse where the original has none. To play chord melodies, simply play the following chords – each chord times up to the same note in the bass riff. E (7th fret, 5th string) G (5th fret, 4th string) D (5th fret, 5th string) C (3rd fret, 5th string B (2nd fret, 5th string Play these as straight chords or powerchords. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Set up your amp for a grittier distorted sound. Adjust your amp settings to get a real \"White Stripes\" sound from your guitar. Don't worry, you're not opening anything up. Just change the settings a little. Turn the Gain knob up to 8. To even that out, turn your Treble knob all the way up to 7 or 8, too. Keep the Middle knob at 5 while the Bass should be pumped up to 8. If your amp has an effect called \"Presence,\" turn that up to 8."

      "content": "Review your power chords if you've never used them. Power chords are simple 2-finger chords used for big, brash, and quick songs. [4] X Research source If you've never played them before, don’t worry. They’re actually easy to build. Press your index finger on the top two strings of any fret – use the first note of the Seven Nation Army riff (7th fret, 5th string) to start. Now, simply place your ring finger one string over and two frets down on the 9th fret, 4th string. Only play these two strings to make your power chord Place your pinky on the string and fret below your ring finger (9th fret, 3rd string) for even bigger, better-sounding chords, so your final chord has three notes. The note your index finger is on determines the chord. Since the note in the example is an E, this is an E power chord."

Switch to an A power chord (5th fret, 6th string) or an open A (2nd fret, 2nd-4th strings) for one full measure or count of four beats."

After learning the power chords, put the three parts of the song together. There’s a verse, a chorus, and a bridge. Listen to the song to see how the music changes during these parts. [8] X Research source The verse is only bass and drums. [9] X Research source You can, however, play the chords of the song or the bass riff on the guitar. The bridge is a short piece of music that leads in and out of the chorus. At the end of the verse, right before jumping into the power chords, play the 2-chord bridge. You also play it after the chorus, right before going into the verse again. The chorus is your power chord riff. Play this exact same riff after the guitar solo."

Review and learn the bass line before the solo. It is easy enough and will help immensely. All you're doing is taking the following sets of notes and playing them in the same rhythm as the bass solo. Start the first part of the solo on the 9th fret, 3rd string. The solo’s two sections follow the style of the bass riff. [11] X Research source The first half starts on the 9th string, playing the 9th string repeatedly in place of the held root note in the bass riff. After leaving the 9th, keep playing the rest of the notes, like the bass guitar. Play this riff twice. |G|-----9~~--9-9-9-9/12b--11~---9~~-9-12-14-12--12-12/14-12-11-----"
