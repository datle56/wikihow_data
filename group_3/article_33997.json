Once you've selected a beach, consider the price, how far it is, and how much gas it'll take you to get there.

Make sure you'll have enough time to get to the beach in order to arrive on the date you have planned. Also, know when you're planning to leave the beach and get home.You HAVE to know when you're going to the beach. Unless you come home from work and say 'Okay, I'm going to the beach.'. It just doesn't work well that way. Plan a day for the beach. Make sure you watch the news to see how the weather's going to be! If you're planning to stay overnight, book a room at a hotel or motel ahead of time. This way, you know you'll have a room waiting for you when you get there, and you won't have to search for another place to stay if you find that there are no rooms left upon your arrival."

The extra change of clothes is for the ride home, so you won't be all wet and sandy. [1] X Research source Also, make sure you're comfortable enough to spend all day in the clothes you wear down. Having a changes of clothes means you can head somewhere else after the beach. Don't forget to include good footwear. Take sandals for the beach and water shoes for the ocean so you're ready for anything. Pack spare towels, clothes (including a hat and sunglasses and extra change of clothes), and bathing suits. Make sure you put things like cell phones and wallets in a plastic bag so they don't get wet. If you have kids, a bucket and shovel are perfect for building sandcastles. Don't forget water. If you're planning to stay overnight, you might want to pack items needed for washing up. Also, depending on how long you're planning to stay, you might need more than one change of clothes and other additional items."

      "content": "Take protection from the sun. You don't want to ruin your beach trip with a bad sunburn. Plus, protecting yourself from the sun will keep your skin looking younger as you age and guard against skin cancer. Wear a hat, sunglasses, and sunscreen, and make sure to reapply! Start with a sunscreen of at least 15 SPF. Check to make sure it protects against both UVA and UVB rays. Don't forget to add a lip balm with sunscreen to protect your lips. Make sure to reapply it frequently, especially after sweating or jumping in the water. Use clothing for protection. Hats and sunglasses offer much needed protection for your face and eyes, but wearing a coverup with long sleeves can also offer protection. If coverups aren't your thing, take a beach umbrella or tent/gazebo instead."

If you choose a plastic chair, you may still want to bring the extra towel to keep your chair from getting too hot while you are away. You could also bring an old blanket you don't mind getting sandy. Another option is an old fitted king-size sheet. You can put things like bags and coolers in the corners, so that the sheet makes a cozy little playpen for you and your family. [2] X Research source"

Make sure you have an assortment of bandages, including small adhesive ones as well as roller bandages, gauze pads, and medical tape. You should also have things like antiseptic packets, hydrocortisone packets, non-latex gloves, and compress dressings.

Pick a bag that's fairly water resistant or waterproof so that you can stash your phone and wallet away. Leave anything irreplaceable behind that you can so you don't lose or damage it on the beach. Another trick to protect your valuables is to clean out an old sunscreen bottle. Use it to hide valuables you don't want anyone to steal, and as a bonus, it keeps them dry. You can also stash electronics in zip-top bags for protection. [5] X Research source For beach toys, find a net bag so sand can be left on the beach. Pack all the food in a cooler with ice."

A game like Twister, for instance, would be great for the beach. [6] X Research source Remember to include fun for the kids in your group. On the beach, all you need are some simple toys, such as buckets, shovels, and other cheap toys. Your kids will have a blast in the sand and water. [7] X Research source"

You may also want a portable charger for your phone. Slip the e-reader into a zip-top bag to protect it. You could also take activity books such as crossword puzzles and Sudoku books."

[10] X Research source Some good snacks to take include fruit, granola bars, vegetable sticks, and bottles of water. Skip the sodas as those don't hydrate as well. In fact, if you're planning on staying all day, consider just packing lunch. Though you can take a cooler for drinks, you might want to pick something that won't spoil easily, such as a peanut butter and jelly. Bring a small bag for any trash you may accumulate. It may be difficult to find a trashcan at the beach. Bring moist towelettes with your food. You can use them to clean up hands before and after your eat."

That way, you'll have more opportunity to find a good spot. [11] X Research source Pick a spot near the water but not so near you'll be overrun if the tide comes in. If the beach has chairs or umbrellas for rent, consider renting one to make life easier. Stick with like-minded beachgoers. That is, if you're there to party and have fun with your friends, pick an area where people are being louder and playing music. If you prefer a quiet place to read, try to find a more secluded spot. If you're there with your family, look for other families to be near, so your kids can play together. Unload all your luggage into your hotel or motel room if you're staying overnight. If not, simply lay out your beach items and bask in the sun! Make sure to put on plenty of sunscreen to eliminate sunburn or too much tan. It's not recommended you get a tan, as it will make your skin wrinkly and old as you age. If you like tans, it's best to get it done by a professional in the spa instead of doing it in the sun, as the rays can be harmful."

The important thing is that you feel comfortable and that you like the suit. [13] X Research source For instance, you may not think you can get away with a two-piece because of your curves. If you don't feel comfortable showing as much skin, you could wear a tankini, which is basically a tank top with a bikini bottom, or a high-waisted bikini. Pick a fun pattern and rock that suit. For men, you also need to decide what you want out of your suit, such as how much skin you want to show. You could go for anything from full-length trunk shorts to swim briefs."

If you're wearing a revealing swimsuit and you're not a fan of body hair showing, you're going to need to spend some time shaving before you go to the beach. Take some time to shave your legs and any other areas that might need it, such your bikini line or armpits, before you go. [15] X Research source If you're not comfortable shaving or waxing these areas yourself, let a professional do it. Set up an appointment to get a bikini wax done. If you're guy, you may want to shave your back or have someone do it for you. Make sure to check yourself out in the sunlight, as you're more likely to spot hairs in the sun."

      "title": "Exfoliate your skin.",
      "content": "Exfoliate your skin. To make your skin shimmer, you may want to spend some time exfoliating. Exfoliating is just a way of removing dead skin so that you skin doesn't look ashy or rough. You have the option of using a chemical exfoliant or a physical exfoliant. A chemical exfoliant uses chemicals, generally acids, to break down the dead skin. A physical exfoliant uses small beads or crushed pieces of seed or shell in a solution to rub away the dead skin. You'll also find exfoliating gloves that fall in this category. Even a washcloth is a physical exfoliant. To use an exfoliant, hop in the shower first to get your skin damp. Rub the exfoliant in with your hand, a glove, or washcloth in gentle circles. Wash the exfoliant away when your done. If you're using an exfoliating glove or washcloth, simple put your normal soap on it, and use it to rub the soap into your skin in gentle circles. Be sure to focus on problem areas like knees, elbows, and feet. After you exfoliate, apply a good moisturizer to your skin."

That way, your stomach won't be pooched out because of bloating. Skip cruciferous vegetables such as broccoli, cabbage, Brussels sprouts, and cauliflower. Also skip processed foods and carbonated beverages. Instead, try other healthy foods such avocados, eggs, nut butters, salmon, bananas, Greek yogurt, and lemons."
