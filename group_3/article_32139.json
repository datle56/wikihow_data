      "content": "Use the paint code to find an exact color match. If you want your fender flares to match the rest of your vehicle, you can find the vehicle's paint code in the manual or by contacting the car or truck manufacturer. Finding the paint code will allow you to go out and purchase the same exact color as the rest of your car. For example, Clover Green's color code for a 2000 Acura Integra is G-95P.

      "content": "Select a paint code that matches your car's trim. Painting the car's trim the same color as your fender flares will give your vehicle a uniform look. Contact the vehicle's manufacturer or look inside of your user manual to find the color code for your vehicle's trim. Painting your fender flares the same color as the vehicle's trim will make them look like they came with the vehicle in most cases. Modern vehicle paint is often fade-resistant. [2] X Research source If you think your car's paint is fading, buffing the car with a cleaning product will remove airborne contaminants and revive the luster of your paint job.

      "content": "Paint your flares a different color for a bold look. If you are going for a more bold or creative look, you can paint your flares a completely different color than the rest of your vehicle. Choose a bright fluorescent color for an upbeat feeling or a more muted color for a laid-back look. If you want your flares to stand out, select a color that contrasts with the vehicle's paint job. For instance, red, yellow, and white fender flares will pop on a black car. Black fender flares look good on a variety of different vehicle colors."

      "content": "Purchase stencils for a custom look. You can go out and purchase stencils that you can use to paint certain designs, such as flames, on your vehicle’s fender flares. Look for these stencils online or at automotive shops. [4] X Research source Examples of stencils you can use include stars, letters, or something that blends in with an existing custom paint job."

      "content": "Purchase an enamel or polyurethane automotive paint. It’s important that you don’t use traditional spray paint to paint your fenders or it may not look good. Instead, go online or to an automotive store and purchase an enamel or polyurethane automotive paint and primer. These paints will come in a spray paint form. If you’re unsure of what to buy, ask a store associate for help."

      "content": "Remove the fender flares from the vehicle. Fender flares are attached to your car by bolts inside of your wheel well. To remove them, unscrew all of the bolts connecting the fender flare to the vehicle with a socket wrench. The fender will still be attached to the car by small plastic clips, but these clips can be detached easily by pulling the fender away from your vehicle. [5] X Research source"

Apply electrical tape along the area where the fender flares and car meet. Drape a large piece of plastic over your car and apply another piece of tape along the edge of the tarp so that it protects areas of your vehicle that you don’t want to paint. [6] X Research source"

Use an all-purpose automotive degreaser to thoroughly wipe down the outer surface of the flares. Do not use a lacquer thinner reducer as your degreaser because it will make the flares hard to paint."

Hold the primer can 1–2 inches (2.5–5.1 cm) away from the flares and push the button on the top of the can. Move your arm in long sweeping motions and try to cover as much of the flare as you can in one sweep. Continue spraying the flares with the primer until you’ve applied a full coat. [8] X Research source If you’ve detached the flares, spray a coat of primer inside the interior of the fender flares. Work in a well-ventilated area and wear a respirator when using spray paint."

Don't wait to remove the stencil or the paint may crack or peel if it's allowed to fully dry."
