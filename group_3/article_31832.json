      "content": "Speak to a Jehovah’s Witness to plan and organize your study session. You can choose when, where, and how often you attend the Bible study. For instance, if you have a few specific questions, you could choose to study the Bible with a member of the Jehovah’s Witnesses for just one hour, one time. You could choose to converse with your Bible study mentor over the phone or online, as well as in person. [1] X Research source Think about your needs and interests in order to choose the best time for the Bible study, and let them know what you’re interested in reading. You are not obligated to become a Jehovah Witness if you opt to engage in a free Bible study."

Attend the Bible study with specific questions in mind so that your Bible study is fruitful and engaging for you and your mentor. [2] X Research source Before your study session begins, you will be given a Bible and a Bible study publication. Look them over before the study session begins. While a Bible study might sound intimidating, don't worry -- there won't be any tests or exams at the end. Think of the Bible study as a conversation about the material you and your mentor read and talk about together."

      "content": "Choose the format you want. The free Bible is available in both audio and textual formats. Audio formats can be downloaded as either MP3 or ACC files. Text Bibles can be downloaded as either EPUB, MOBI, or PDF files. [5] X Research source If you have an e-book reader, you can use any of the formats, but if you plan on reading your Bible on your computer, it probably most convenient to stick with the PDF format. The audio versions are similar. Either can be downloaded onto MP3 players or phones. ACC files, however, generally have better sound quality. Choose the edition you want. You can choose to download either the 1984 or 2013 editions of the New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures. While the versions are similar, there are several vocabulary changes in the updated 2013 version. [6] X Research source The language is more modern and clear, and the text has been adjusted to maximize readability overall. Some previously gendered phrases have been revised so that they are gender-neutral, where appropriate. For instance, the phrase “fatherless boy” has now been rendered as “fatherless child” to better reflect the original meaning of the language. Only the 1984 edition is available in its entirety as an audio download. Only select books of the 2013 edition are available for audio download."

Next, click the format you want. If you’re downloading the audio version, you’ll have to select the specific books you want to download. For instance, if you only want to read Exodus, you’ll have to scroll down the pop-up menu to Exodus after clicking on the audio format of your choice. Then, you’ll have to click the download icon to the right of the book’s name (if downloading the ACC version) or below the book’s name (visible after clicking on the drop-down menu if downloading the MP3 version). If downloading the text version, just click the format you want, then confirm your decision by clicking the download button to the right of the pop-up box."
