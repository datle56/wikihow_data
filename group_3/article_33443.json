      "content": "Shuffle the cards and deal 7 per player. Deal one card face up in the middle where everyone can see it. This will be the start of your discard pile. If the first card is a Trade Hands, put it back in the deck and choose a new one to start the discard pile. [1] X Research source If you can’t decide who should be the dealer, have everyone pick a card, and whoever has the highest number on it gets to deal. (Special cards count as 0 for this purpose.)"

If this is the first time you’ve played the game, you’ll have to take the top and bottom halves of the launcher out of the packaging and click them together. If it’s a new launcher or out of power, put batteries into the battery compartment on the bottom of the launcher. Once the launcher's ready, open it up and put the remaining cards facedown inside. Close the launcher back up. Now you’re ready to start playing!"

If you have a match, place it face up on the discard pile. This will become the card that the next person uses to start their turn. [2] X Research source For example, if the card on top of the discard pile is a blue 3, you can discard a 3 of any color, or a blue of any number or word."

Sometimes you won’t get any, but you have to take any cards it shoots out and add them to your hand. Your turn is now over once you've collected your cards—you don't get to discard any. [3] X Research source If there are some cards sticking halfway out of the launcher, you have to take all of those too!"

Most of the cards are self-explanatory, but some can be more confusing. Here's a list of what each does: [4] X Research source Reverse: reverses direction of play. Skip: skips the next player’s turn. Hit 2: You have to hit the Launcher button twice. Trade Hands: Trade your hand with a player of your choosing. Discard All: This card lets you discard all the cards of the same color as the last card on the discard pile. Wild Card: can be played on any card. The person who played it gets to decide the color going forward. Wild All Hit: The person who played it calls a color, and then everyone has to hit the Launcher button except the player who played Wild All Hit. The play continues with the color the player called. Wild Hit-Fire: The person who played it calls a color, and the person after them presses the launcher button until it launches cards. Then they take all the cards and lose their turn."

It's surprisingly hard to discard all your cards, because once your fellow players see you're down to just one, they'll try to skip your turn or stick you with new cards.

Numbered cards are counted by their face value, Reverse/Skip/Hit 2 are 20 points, Discard All/Trade Hands are 30 points, and all Wild cards are 50 points. [6] X Research source"
