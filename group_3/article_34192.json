For this diagnosis, blood clots the size of a quarter or larger are considered to be connected to heavy bleeding. Check your pad, tampon, and the toilet for blood clots.

Doctors often prescribe oral contraceptives in cases where patients are having periods with heavy bleeding. Oral contraceptives can make your periods more regular, but they can also decrease the amount you bleed overall, which in turn can decrease blood clots. [15] X Trustworthy Source Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Main public health institute for the US, run by the Dept. of Health and Human Services Go to source Oral contraceptives can help because heavy bleeding and blood clotting is sometimes caused by hormonal imbalances.

In an endometrial ablation or resection, more of the uterine lining is removed.
