Eventually, you’ll be confident enough to deliver the speech to a public audience. Tell other people about your goals to make yourself accountable for them. You may even ask a trusted friend or mentor to be an accountability partner. They should check in every now and then to see how far you have progressed. Reader Poll: We asked 196 wikiHow readers what advice regarding setting goals they find most helpful, and only 7% of them said telling other people about their goals so they can support them. [Take Poll] Sharing your goals with others can be a great way to hold yourself accountable, but you can still achieve your goals while keeping them private."
