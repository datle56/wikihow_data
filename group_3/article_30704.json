      "content": "Subtract 6–7 feet (1.8–2.1 m) from the total rise to account for headroom. Headroom refers to the height between the top of the stair to the ceiling. Add a headroom measurement of at least 6–7 feet (1.8–2.1 m) to prevent injuries. Headroom heights usually aren't regulated by building codes, but your local building code may have recommendations for stair headroom, so be sure to check. For instance, if the total rise is 114 inches (290 cm), subtract 6 feet (1.8 m), which is 72 inches (180 cm), to account for the headroom. This will leave you with a rise of 42 inches (110 cm)."

      "content": "Divide the rise by 6 or 7 inches (15 or 18 cm) to find the total number of stairs. For larger stairs, divide by 6 and for smaller stairs, divide by 7. The total you get is how many stairs your future staircase will have so you can plan accordingly. [3] X Research source If the rise is 42 inches (110 cm) (after subtracting 6–7 feet (1.8–2.1 m) for headroom) and you want larger stairs, for example, divide 42 by 6. Your staircase will have 7 stairs. If dividing the height to the second floor by your preferred height for the riser does not give you a whole number, round your calculation up if the decimal is larger than 0.5 or down if the decimal is smaller than 0.4."

Generally, a stair's run should be at least 9–10 inches (23–25 cm) so people have enough room to step, but you can make them longer if desired. The depth of each stair has to be enough for a person to safely walk up. [5] X Expert Source Lui Colmenares Licensed Contractor Expert Interview. 18 August 2020."

The average minimum width for each stair is 36 inches (91 cm), but you can make the stairs wider if desired. [6] X Research source This is the same as the total width of the staircase as well. For a specific minimum width, contact your local government about the building code for stairs."

      "content": "Calculate your staircase's stringer length . Stringers run diagonally along the length of each stair to prevent them from collapsing. To determine their length, square the run, square the individual stair rise, and then add the 2 numbers together. From there, find the square root of the answer for the length of each stringer. [7] X Research source For instance, if the run is 10 inches, square 10 by multiplying it by itself to get 100. If the individual stair rise is 7 inches, square 7 by multiplying it by itself to get 49 inches. Add 100 and 49 to get 149. Then, find the square root of 149, which is 12.206, meaning the length of each stringer will be 12.2 inches."
