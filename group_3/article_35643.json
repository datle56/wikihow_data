For example, 3 and 4 are both factors of 12, because you can multiply them together to get 12. To list the factors of a number, you simply have to list all of the numbers that can be multiplied to get that number, and which therefore can be evenly divided into that number. [1] X Research source List the factors of that number from smallest to largest, not forgetting to include 1 or that number. For example, this is how you would list the factors of the numerator and denominator of the fraction, 24/32: 24: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24. 32: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32."

[2] X Research source 24: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8 , 12, 24. 32: 1, 2, 4, 8 , 16, 32. The GCF of 24 and 32 is 8, because 8 is the largest number that evenly divides into both 24 and 32."

If you'd like to make sure that you've simplified the fraction correctly, you can simply multiply the new numerator and new denominator by the GCF to make sure that you can return to the original fraction. Here's how to do it: [4] X Research source 3 * 8 = 24 4 * 8 = 32 You have returned to the original fraction, 24/32. You can also examine the fraction to make sure that it cannot be reduced any more. Since 3 is a prime number, it can only be divisible by 1 and itself, and four is not divisible by 3, so the fraction cannot be reduced further."

Look at the fractions to make sure that each one is divisible by the number you choose at least once. [5] X Research source For example, if you're looking at the fraction 24/108, don't pick the number 5, because it won't go into either number. However, if you're looking at the fraction 25/60, 5 will be a great number to use. For the fraction 24/32, the number 2 works well. Since both numbers are even, they will be divisible by 2."

In the fraction 3/4, 3 is a prime number, so its only factors are 1 and itself, and 4 is not divisible by three, so the fraction has been simplified as much as possible. If the numerator or denominator of the fraction can no longer be divisible by the number you've chosen, you may still be able to divide it by using a new number. [7] X Research source For example, if you have the fraction 10/40, and are dividing the numerator and denominator by 5, you will be left with 2/8. You cannot keep dividing the numerator and denominator by 5, but you can divide both by 2 to get the final answer of 1/4."

A \"prime\" number is a number that cannot be divided by any other number and stay whole (apart from itself and 1, of course). 2, 3, 5, 7, and 11 are examples of prime numbers. [8] X Research source Start with the numerator. From 24, branch off into 2 and 12. Since 2 is a prime number already, you're done with that branch! Then take 12 into two more numbers: 2 and 6. 2 is a prime number -- great! Now divide 6 into two numbers: 2 and 3. You now have 2, 2, 2, and 3 as your prime numbers. Move onto the denominator. From 60, branch off your tree to 2 and 30. 30 will then split into 2 and 15. Then split 15 into 3 and 5,both prime. You now have 2, 2, 3 and 5 as your prime numbers."
