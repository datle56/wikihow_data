      "content": "Position your desk so you can look out a window if you can. Being able to look out a window while you work can help reduce stress levels and focus better on your work. Move your desk to a location where you can easily sit down and glance out the window occasionally. Check that there is no glare on your computer screen or light in your eyes throughout the day so you don’t get distracted or annoyed. If you’re working in an open-plan office or a cubicle, talk to your office administrator or boss to see if it’s okay to change the position of your desk."

      "title": "Keep the things you use most frequently closest to you.",
      "content": "Keep the things you use most frequently closest to you. Write lists of the things that you use daily, weekly, and monthly so you know what’s important to keep near you. Keep the things you use daily within arm’s reach of your desk so you can grab them when you need to. If you use things less frequently, store them in drawers or closets that are further away to remove clutter and save space. [1] X Research source For example, if you don’t use a printer often, keep it on the other side of the room so it’s not taking up space on your desk. If there are things that you use multiple times per day, keep them on your desk, a nearby shelf, or in the top drawer of your desk."

      "content": "Get rolling furniture so you can move things out of the way easily. Look for organizers, shelves, or cabinets that have wheels so you can pull them out when you need to and then put them back. Keep shorter things, like filing cabinets or shelves, under your desk if you have room and only move them when you need to access them. Try using an office chair with wheels if you’re able so you can roll to a different part of your office to access something. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Keep a trash can in your office so you can get rid of things right away. Store a small bin to the side of your desk or underneath it if you have extra leg room. That way, if you have any trash or files that you don’t need anymore, you can throw them away immediately rather than letting them clutter up your space. Be sure to change the garbage bag frequently so your office stays fresh and clean. Shred any documents with personal info on them before you throw them away."

[4] X Expert Source Keith Bartolomei Professional Organizer & Certified KonMari Consultant Expert Interview. 2 January 2020. If you have any items that you rarely or never use, put them in a separate box or container. Once you go through your entire office, get rid of anything you have in the box so it doesn’t add any clutter. If you’re in an office building, put any unused supplies back in a supply closet so other people can take them if they need to. [5] X Research source"

Store other long office supplies, such as scissors in their own cups as well. Store the pens and supplies so they point down so you don’t accidentally hurt yourself when you try grabbing for something. [6] X Research source You can also buy desktop organizers that have various compartments if you don’t want to use multiple cups. Use glass mason jars if you want your desk to look more decorative."

Only put 1-2 different items in the same bin so they don’t get disorganized. Make paper labels for each of your bins and tape them on the side so you can see what’s stored in them at a glance. Be descriptive with your labels so you don’t get confused later on. [8] X Research source You can buy plastic storage bins from any department store or online."

      "content": "Shred any documents you don’t need that have personal information.

[9] X Research source If you have important documents that you can’t get rid of, such as birth certificates, social security cards, or living wills, store them in a fireproof safe to protect them from any damage."

Pick a vertical paper tray if you don’t have a lot of space, or a horizontal tray if you have some room to spare. Put the organizer near the edge of your desk so you can reach it easily throughout the day and grab what you need. Label each of the tiers so you know where certain documents should go. [10] X Research source You can buy paper trays from office supply stores. Paper trays also work great for holding folders or notebooks. Designate a section of your desk to stay clean so you have room to spread out if you need to. [11] X Research source"

Organize the bulletin board into sections where you can pin items, such as documents, receipts, sticky notes, and memos. Keep the most important documents visible and stack older ones underneath. [13] X Research source Many cubicles already have walls that you can put thumbtacks in. Use differently colored thumbtacks for each type of document you hang. For example, you may hang memos with blue pins and receipts with red ones. You can also pin personal photos if you don’t have space for them on your desk."

      "content": "Color-code folders so they’re easy to recognize. Get file folders in various colors and sort your documents so similar ones all share a single color. For example, you may put different types of expenses in red folders and income forms in green folders. Label the tabs on the folders with what type of document is inside. Once you have your documents organized, put them in a filing cabinet in a paper tray so you can find them easily.

[15] X Research source Backup any important documents on a cloud storage site or external hard drive so you don’t lose them if your computer ever crashes. If you have a scanner, you can upload physical documents onto your computer so you can get rid of the paper documents."
