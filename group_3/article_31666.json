Hold the bottle opener by the handle so the flat end with the cut-out section in the middle is exposed.

The edge of the cut-out section closest to the handle is the edge you want to wedge under the bottle cap. [2] X Research source After you wedge the sharp edge of the bottle opener under the bottle cap, the opposite edge of the cutout section should be resting on the top of the bottle cap."

      "content": "Lift the handle of the bottle opener up with your dominant hand. As you lift the handle up, the far edge of the cut-out section of the bottle opener will press down on top of the bottle cap. At the same time, the sharp edge of the bottle opener will lift up the side of the cap, causing the cap to bend upward and pop off of the bottle. [3] X Research source"
