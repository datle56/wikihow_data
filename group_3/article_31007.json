You can even use a wooden jewelry box, as long as the lid is flat and smooth. You can find lots of blank wooden objects in the wood crafting section of an arts and craft store."

Most wood objects from the craft store will already have a smooth surface, but they may have jagged edges. Sand those smooth with medium to fine-grit sandpaper. Work your way with the grain, not against it. [2] X Research source To make sure it's smooth, you can slip a piece of pantyhose over the wood. If it doesn't snag on any small wood fragments, it's good to go. For a more professional touch, lightly sand the edges and corners of your wooden block or board. This give it a softer look. Thoroughly wipe away the wood dust once you're done sanding. Otherwise, the dust might get stuck in the Mod Podge.

      "content": "Paint the side edges of your wood object, if desired. If you are applying a photo to a wooden board, the side edges will be visible. You can give your piece a nicer finish by applying two coats of acrylic paint to the side edges. Allow the first coat to dry before applying the second one. Let the paint dry completely before moving on, about 20 minutes. [4] X Research source Use acrylic paint in a color that matches the photograph. Extend the paint onto the front of the board. This way, if you accidentally cut the photo too small, you won't see any raw wood."

If you are going to apply multiple photos to a multi-sided object (ie: a block), choose one side to start with. You can apply the Mod Podge with a wide, flat paintbrush or a foam brush. Make sure that you apply the Mod Podge thickly and evenly. Mod Podge comes in different finishes. Choose one that you like the best: matte, glossy, or satin."
