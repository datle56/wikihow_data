    {
      "title": "Identify the topic of your speech.",
      "content": "Identify the topic of your speech. Choose a single focused message rather than trying to cover multiple topics. Like the thesis of an essay, what you say should connect to your main point. [1] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Pinpoint your audience.",
      "content": "Pinpoint your audience. Are you speaking to children or adults? Are you speaking to people who know nothing about your topic or people who are experts on your topic? Understanding your audience will help you to target your speech appropriately.

    {
      "title": "Consider your motives.",
      "content": "Consider your motives. A good speech answers a need that the audience has. Are you trying to make your audience laugh? Are you trying to build their morale, or are you communicating a sober and direct message so that you can change their behavior? These questions will set the mood and tone of your speech."
    },
    {
      "title": "Think about the setting.",
      "content": "Think about the setting. Is this a speech for a small group or a speech to deliver before a large audience? You may have more opportunities to interact with a smaller audience so you can add in time for things like questions. With a larger audience, you may need to stick to a firmer structure. [3] X Research source You may even be able to redirect or add points to your speech with a smaller audience if you notice a number of them are interested in a particular subject or niche."

    {
      "title": "Write a succinct, single-sentence statement about your subject.",
      "content": "Write a succinct, single-sentence statement about your subject. Try to write something that will hook your audience so that you immediately grab their attention. [4] X Trustworthy Source American Bar Association Leading professional organization of lawyers and law students Go to source Try starting the speech writing process by free-writing. Write as much as you can about your subject as fast as you can. Don't worry about judgment or crafting perfect sentences. Once you have your points on paper, you can start refining them and putting them in order. Use an anecdote or a quote. Sometimes, someone else has already said it better than you ever will. A quote, provided it hasn't been overused, can help you get things started. Just be sure to look for a quote that is surprising or unique, and always credit your source. Be cautious about opening with a joke unless you know your audience well. You may think that a joke is funny, but your audience may find it humorless or even offensive."

    {
      "title": "Choose 3 to 5 supporting points for your topic.",
      "content": "Choose 3 to 5 supporting points for your topic. Make sure that your points are concise and direct. You can start by looking at generic sources like an encyclopedia or Wikipedia, but you need to fact check your ideas with more authoritative sources after you generally understand your subject. Draw on your own experience. If you have a long history with your topic, your experiences and personal stories can be great resources. Just keep these stories succinct so that you don't ramble and lose the audience's attention."

    {
      "title": "Choose how to keep your speech on point.",
      "content": "Choose how to keep your speech on point. Decide whether you want to write out your speech or to outline the speech on index cards. [5] X Research source Consider your comfort level with the topic. If you know the topic well and can improvise easily, then use index cards. Use 1 card for the introduction. This card should include your opening statement. Use 1 or 2 cards for each supporting point. Then, create 1 card for the conclusion which ties back to the main idea of your speech. Write brief sentence fragments or even single words on your cards. These words or fragments should contain key phrases that remind you of what you want to say. If you feel insecure or don't know the subject well, write out the words of your speech exactly as you want to say them."
    },
    {
      "title": "Decide whether you want to use visual aids.",
      "content": "Decide whether you want to use visual aids. The choice to use visual aids will depend on the size of your audience and the length of your speech. A long speech, for example, may be easier to sit through with some visuals to break it up. You may create a Prezi or a PowerPoint presentation to go along with your speech, or you may choose to use paper-based charts and graphs. [6] X Research source Keep the visuals to a minimum. You want them to aid your speech, not to overshadow it. Always make sure your speech can stand on its own should technical problems occur. Make sure that the audience can read the content of your visuals. Too big is better than not big enough. Check the facilities of the room in which you will be speaking. If you need Internet or you need a projection screen, be sure that the facility has the equipment. Arrive to the room early to make sure everything is functional for your speech."

    {
      "title": "Write a brief biographical introduction about yourself.",
      "content": "Write a brief biographical introduction about yourself. Providing your credentials before your speech can help you set your tone, and give you the chance to list your credentials without bragging. Use this to let the audience get an assessment of who you are, and take the moment to introduce not only your background but your style of speaking. [7] X Research source If someone will be introducing you before your speech, then providing this introduction beforehand will be helpful."

    {
      "title": "Set a timer.",
      "content": "Set a timer. You should know how long your speech needs to be. If you can't deliver the speech within the given amount of time, then you may need to shorten it or lengthen it. Remember to include time for a Q&A period if appropriate."

      "title": "Practice your speech in front of a friend or a mirror.",
      "content": "Practice your speech in front of a friend or a mirror. Practice looking up at your audience so that your eyes aren't always on your notes. Be sure to include your visual aids in your practice to make sure they are smooth. [8] X Research source If you drive a regular commute, you can also practice a memorized speech while driving. Don't look off of notecards while on the road, though."

[9] X Trustworthy Source Edutopia Educational nonprofit organization focused on encouraging and celebrating classroom innovation Go to source Make sure that your gestures are natural and not too frenetic. Alternatively, don't fix your arms at your sides or keep your hands latched to the podium. If you make the speech to a friend or colleague and they offer constructive criticism, try to be open to what they have to say. Make sure they are familiar with your topic or industry, though, or their criticism may do more harm than good."

      "title": "Ask for a sound check.",
      "content": "Ask for a sound check. If you're in a small room, ask someone to stand at the back of the room and see if he or she can hear you. In a larger facility, practice using the microphone so that your speech is neither too faint nor distorted. Try to arrive at your presentation well before your audience. Take the time to make sure the sound is good and run through your visual aids. If you're at a conference, you may have 15-20 minutes to prep. If you're the sole speaker, you could get there an hour in advance."

      "content": "Look around the audience. Don't focus on only one person or area. [12] X Research source Make eye contact with members of your audience. If eye contact is too intense for you, look just above their heads at a point such as a clock or a painting. Remember to look to both sides of the room. Don't favor just the right or left.

      "content": "Laugh at yourself if something goes wrong. If by chance, you forget your speech, then simply say thank you and leave the stage.

That way, you can control the flow of the Q and A. Then, after the last question, let your audience know, \"I'd like to share one final thought with you,\" and deliver a powerful closer."
