      "title": "Ask a friend to play cards.",
      "content": "Ask a friend to play cards. Find someone who enjoys a prank and has time to hang out and have fun. You can have more than one player, as long as none of the players know that 52 Card Pickup is a trick."

    {
      "title": "Find a deck of playing cards.",
      "content": "Find a deck of playing cards. Preferably use a deck of playing cards that belongs to one of the players. This will increase the chances of the cards being picked up instead of being left on the floor when the prank is over. It is also best if there are 52 cards in the deck."
    },
    {
      "title": "Shuffle the cards.",
      "content": "Shuffle the cards. As the dealer, you can shuffle the cards yourself or allow one of the players to shuffle them. Shuffling the cards is optional, but preferred because it gives the impression of a real game. In reality, it does not matter if the cards are mixed up. Try not to laugh because the players may become suspicious."
    },
    {
      "title": "Prepare the players.",
      "content": "Prepare the players. After you have shuffled the cards, ask the following question: “Are you ready to play 52 Card Pickup?”"

Then say: “It's 52 card pickup!” Another opportunity to play 52 Card Pickup is when you are playing absolutely any other card game and you find yourself losing. You can stop the game and say “52 card pickup” just before releasing all of the cards onto the floor."
