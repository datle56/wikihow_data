      "content": "Place new staples legs-down in the tray. Always place staples as close to the tray's front end as possible. The front end is the side closest to the inside of the stapler. Push any unused staples to the front as well to create additional space. If your stapler is jammed, dump out the old staples. Use pliers to pull out any staples that are stuck."

Press it to pop out the staple tray. Your stapler may also have a small piece of plastic over the tray that you'll need to remove. Hold the base of the stapler steady with 1 hand. It wouldn't be good if the tray comes open and loose staples fly everywhere."
