Choose a concealer shade that’s 1-2 shades lighter than your natural skin tone. Add a small dot at the very tip of your nose to give it a slight upturn.

      "content": "Draw 2 parallel lines down your nose with dark concealer or contour . If you’re using concealer, pick one that’s 1-2 shades darker than your natural tone. If you’re using contour, choose the darkest color in your palette. Use a small, angled makeup brush and draw 2 thin lines down the sides of bridge of your nose toward the nostrils. [4] X Research source Add a thin, subtle line going across the bottom of your nose so the end result doesn’t look too long. The closer the lines are, the slimmer your nose will look. Make sure to leave some space between them for a natural look. The distance between the lines depends on your nose and face shape. It may take a few tries to learn to contour your nose in a way you love."

Closeup pictures actually distort images slightly, so your nose may appear up to 30% bigger on camera than it is in real life. [14] X Research source Center your face and keep your chin and forehead equidistant from the camera. Objects near the edge of the photo will appear the most distorted. Be kind to yourself when you look at your pictures. Photos don't always show what you really look like, and everyone takes a bad photo now and then!"

      "content": "Try nose shaping exercises, but keep your expectations realistic. Currently, there’s no scientific evidence that nose exercises or face yoga can reshape your nose. Its shape is largely determined by your bone and cartilage structure, which can’t be altered without surgery. There aren’t bad side effects to nose exercises—some can get rid of smile lines, and breathing exercises are helpful for relaxation and energizing your brain. There hasn’t been much research done on nose exercises, so it’s possible you might see very subtle results after a long period of consistent dedication."

Rhinoplasty is the only way to effectively and permanently reshape your nose. Make sure that it is something you truly want before requesting the procedure. Patients leave the facility the same day and see results when they remove their nose splint after a week or two. Full recovery might take up to 1 year."
