      "title": "Ask them what they last read.",
      "content": "Ask them what they last read. You can gather a lot of information by asking about the last book they read. If they tell you they disliked a book they just read, ask them why they disliked it and what kinds of books they like better. Once you get a sense of the kinds of books they like, you’ll be better prepared to make an appropriate recommendation. [1] X Research source You could also ask if they like a particular genre."

      "title": "Match your recommendation to the theme of their favorite title.",
      "content": "Match your recommendation to the theme of their favorite title. Ask them to describe the theme and genre of their favorite book, such as a futuristic city in a science fiction novel. Recommend a book that has a similar theme and genre. [2] X Research source If they enjoy reading melancholic books set in a post-apocalyptic future, recommend books that explore similar themes and moods.

      "title": "Recommend a classic celebrated by famous authors.",
      "content": "Recommend a classic celebrated by famous authors. It can be more convincing to get a recommendation based on a famous author, such as David Foster Wallace, Stephen King, or Margaret Atwood. Since many famous authors recommend classics, you might end up giving them a recommendation for a classic novel. Based on the recommendations of 124 great authors, the best book of the nineteenth century is Anna Karenina by Leo Tolstoy. For twentieth century books, great authors tend to recommend Lolita by Vladimir Nabokov."

      "title": "Make a recommendation based on their personal style.",
      "content": "Make a recommendation based on their personal style. Find inspiration for your recommendation by looking at their clothes, jewelry, haircut, and tattoos. Base your recommendation on the ideas, images, and themes you see them expressing in their personal style. If they’re really into fashion, you could recommend The Devil Wears Prada . If they are really into gothic fashion, you could recommend The Exorcist by William Peter Blatty. If their tattoo has a fantasy image with a boat, you could look for a fantasy novel with a similar looking cover."

Once you give them the book, they will see it everywhere and feel like they should read it. Of course, you should give them something that is well suited to their preferences, rather than forcing them to read something that you like."

      "content": "Make references to the book in conversation. Start making side references to the book you want them to read. By peppering your conversation with little references to the book, they’ll become intrigued and will likely want to understand more of the context for your references. If you are on a hike in the woods and want to recommend the Southern Reach Trilogy by Jeff Vandermeer, you could remark, “It’s getting rather spooky, just like Area X in the novel Annihilation .” If you are at a bar enjoying a gin and tonic and want to recommend The Great Gatsby by F.

      "content": "Don’t be snobby. Although you may feel they should be reading better books and authors, it’s best to avoid looking down on what they enjoy. If they feel you are being snobby or pretentious, it is unlikely they will take your recommendations to heart. Instead, learn to appreciate their taste and recommend books that are generally aligned with what they enjoy. For instance, avoid recommending Marcel Proust’s In Search of Lost Time to someone who typically avoids classical novels."
