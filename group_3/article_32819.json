Choose someone to be the dealer and ask them to shuffle a deck of 52 playing cards with the Jokers removed.

      "content": "Put the deck in the center of the table and turn over the top card. The deck in the center of the table is called the “stock” pile. Place the turned-over card next to the stockpile—this is called the “upcard.” [2] X Research source The upcard is also the start of the discard pile."

      "content": "See if the upcard matches a card in your hand. The player to the dealer’s left goes first. Compare the upcard to the cards in your hand—if you have a card of the same rank (like 2, 3, or Queen), discard it on top of the upcard. Discard an additional card from your hand on top of that. Your turn ends, and the player to your left takes their turn. [3] X Research source If the upcard is a 7 and you have a 7 in your hand, you put the 7 on top of the upcard. You then decide to discard an Ace. The Ace becomes the new upcard for the next player. Alternatively, place the upcard with the matching card from your hand on the table in front of you. This allows others to see what’s been matched and decide which cards to discard."

      "title": "Turn over a new card if you can’t match the rank of the upcard.",
      "content": "Turn over a new card if you can’t match the rank of the upcard. If you don’t have any cards in your hand that are the same rank as the upcard, take a new card from the stock and flip it over face-up on top of the upcard. [4] X Research source If you have a card that matches the upcard: Place it on top of the upcard. The next player takes their turn. If you still can’t match the upcard: You don’t get to discard a card from your hand. The turn passes to the next player."

When someone runs out of all 5 cards in their hand, they’re the winner! [5] X Research source Alternatively, decide how many games you’d like to play in your session. Keep track of who wins each game on a notepad or with chips—whoever wins the most games wins. In online versions, you bet money on each game. This value can be increased or decreased as the game progresses. The game is over when a player runs out of money. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Pay attention to the cards played so you can choose what to hold onto. Since there are only 4 cards of each rank in the game, paying attention to what cards other players discard can let you know which cards to discard and which ones to keep in your hand. For example, if you know there are 3 Jacks under the upcard in the discard pile and you have 1 in your hand, you know you probably can’t match it to anything and can discard it. If you know that no one has discarded any Aces, you might keep the Ace in your hand. When an Ace becomes an upcard, you can discard it."

However, in this variation, you can either match the rank (like 4, 6, or King) or the suit (hearts, diamonds, clubs, or spades). [7] X Research source For example, if the upcard is a 4 of hearts, you can either put down a 4 or any card from the heart suit. Alternatively, make it so that the players have to match the suit of the upcard with a playing card of the same suit in their hand."

Start by drawing a card from the stock or the discard pile. If you have 2 cards of the same rank, put them on the table in front of you. Discard any card from your hand, and the play continues to the next player. [8] X Research source When a player runs out of all their cards and has 3 matching pairs on the table in front of them, they win! [9] X Research source"
