      "title": "Gather your materials.",
      "content": "Gather your materials. Making a tiered skirt is an easy, quick project, but you will need to have all of your materials ready to go before you begin. You will need: [1] X Research source Fabric in the colors and prints of your choice. You can use different colors or prints, or just one type if you only want the layered look. A sewing machine. Scissors. Measuring tape. A ½” to ¾” wide piece of elastic long enough to go around your skirt’s waistband."

      "title": "Determine the length of your skirt.",
      "content": "Determine the length of your skirt. You can make your tiered skirt any length you want it to be. However, you will need to know how long you want your skirt to be before you get started. This measurement is important for cutting your fabric and ensuring that your pieces are even. [2] X Research source To determine how long you want your skirt to be, you can use a skirt that is the length you want your tiered skirt to be. Measure the skirt from the waist to the bottom hem and add 4” to this number to account for the hem, seams, and waistband. You can also measure the length on yourself or the person for whom you are making this skirt. Measure from the natural waist to the spot where you want the skirt to end and add 4” for the hem, seams, and waistband. If you plan to make your skirt with more than three tiers, then you will need more than 4\" of extra fabric to work with. Add an extra inch for each additional tier. For example, if you want a four tiered skirt, then add an additional 5\" inches to your length total. If you want to make a five tiered skirt, then add 6\" to your length total, and so on."

    {
      "title": "Divide",
      "content": "Divide the length. After you have your length, you will need to divide this number by the number of tiers that you want your skirt to have to get the length measurement for each of your pieces. To get this number, divide the total number of tiers you want and write it down. [3] X Research source For example, if your total skirt length is 30”, and you want to make a three tiered skirt, then you would divide 30” by 3 and get 10”. That means that each of your pieces will need to be 10” long. To add more tiers to your skirt, divide your total length by the number of tiers you want. For example, if you wanted to create a five tiered skirt, then you would divide the total skirt length by 5. For example, if your total length is 35” and you want a five tiered skirt, then you would divide 35” by 5 for a result of 7” per piece."

      "title": "Calculate the width of each tier.",
      "content": "Calculate the width of each tier. Each of your tier pieces will need to be a different width to ensure that the skirt flows outwards towards the bottom. To determine how wide to make each piece, you will need to know the waist measurement for the person who will be wearing this skirt. Measure the person’s waist and record this number. Then, you will need to use a different equation for each tier. For example, if creating a three tiered skirt, then you would need to: [4] X Research source Multiply the waist measurement by 1.5 for the first tier. Therefore, if the person’s waist is 30”, then the first tier will need to be 45” wide. Multiply the waist measurement by 2 for the second tier. For example, if the person’s waist is 30”, then the second tier will need to be 60” wide. Multiply the waist measurement by 2.7 for the third tier. So, if the person’s waist is 30”, then the third tier will need to be 81” wide."

      "title": "Measure and cut your fabric.",
      "content": "Measure and cut your fabric . After you have your measurements, measure and cut your fabric. Use the divided length measurement and the tier width measurements to determine the dimensions of your pieces. When you have measured each piece, cut the fabric according to these dimension. For example, if you are making a three tiered skirt for someone who has a 30” waist and wants the skirt to be 26” (total of 30” with added 4” for hem, seams, and waistband) long, then your measurements would be 10” by 45” for the first tier, 10” by 60” for the second tier, and 10” by 81” for the third tier. If you are using multiple kinds of fabric, then consider which one you want to be the top, middle, and bottom tier before you start cutting."

Then, sew along the short edges to form each piece into a circle. [5] X Research source If you prefer, you can wait to add a seam on the skirt until after you have sewed all of the tiers together. This may be a better option if you are planning to do more than three tiers."

Take your top tier piece and fold over about ½” to 1” (depending on the width of your elastic) of fabric of one of the long edges so that the wrong sides (non-print or non-color sides) are facing each other. This will be the waistband of your skirt. Sew along this edge to create the waistband. [6] X Research source Make sure to leave enough space to add your elastic in later. Leave a small 1” to 2” gap in the seam to insert the elastic."

You will start by gathering the bottom tier and sewing it onto the bottom of the middle tier. To gather the bottom tier, sew a baste stitch into the top of the bottom tier (not the edge that you just hemmed). If you want, you can sew a permanent stitch over the baste stitch when it is gathered to your liking. However, sewing the middle tier to the bottom tier will create this permanent stitch, so it is not absolutely necessary to stitch over the baste stitch."

If you did not create the center seam yet, then make sure that the ends are even. You can adjust the gathering before you start pinning the pieces together to make sure that the pieces are the same length.
