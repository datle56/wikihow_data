      "content": "A short king is generally considered to be a man who is 5 foot 8 or less. Since the average American man is 5 foot 9 (175 cm), a short king typically stands at around 5 foot 8 (174 cm) or less. A short king also possesses other attractive qualities, like a great sense of humor and/or charisma. Short kings are shorter than average men who have realized that their stature is no reason to devalue their own self-worth. In many ways, the short king trend is a version of the body positivity movement. [1] X Research source Short kings have the confidence of their taller, 6-foot counterparts, and don’t allow an inferiority complex to govern their lives. A 2022 study showed that women preferred men significantly taller than them. [2] X Research source Not only that, but men with leadership positions at successful companies were taller on average. However, short kings are ridding themselves of this stigma and embracing their height wholeheartedly. Since height is largely genetic and not something that can be altered outside of having a painful, invasive, and lengthy procedure—pun intended—short kings are defending themselves against continued ridicule since their height is beyond their control."

      "content": "The term originated in a 2018 Tweet by comedian Jaboukie Young-White. In his iconic Tweet , Young-White wrote, “I’m f*****g tired of ‘short’ used as an insult.” He then went on to name a few noteworthy short kings, including Donald Glover, Tom Holland, and Bruno Mars. He added, “Short kings are the enemy of body negativity, and I’ll be forever proud to defend them.” Since then, the short king trend has spread like wildfire, inspiring the small stature community to reclaim the term “short” as a neutral and even positive descriptor. [3] X Research source On social media, people began posting their below-average sized partners, with many users poking fun at the height difference between them while still celebrating their significant other’s short king status. One user advises that you “get yourself a short king,” alluding to how hard they work at looking their best, perhaps in an effort to compensate for their lack of height, and how well they treat their partners. Others rationalize going for short kings instead of tall men, citing that the qualities deemed more conventionally attractive, like height and certain other physical features, do not translate into fulfilling long-lasting relationships. Short kings themselves seem to be in on the fun, with many users commenting things like, “we’re down to earth” and “short kings—we ride at dawn!”"

      "content": "The term “short king” quickly spread from social media to the big screen. In 2024, Saturday Night Live aired a skit in which 3 short kings were vying for one woman’s love in a Bachelorette -style dating show. However, Jacob Elordi, who stands at 6 foot 5, guest-starred in the skit, towering over his short king rivals. The “contestant” ultimately chose Elordi’s character despite his comical immaturity and general unpleasantness, explaining that at least she wouldn’t “have to weirdly bend [her] knees [with him] in photos.”"

      "content": "It depends. Although the word “short” has been recently rebranded, paired with “king,” and given a more positive connotation, not everybody may be on the same page. On the one hand, some shorter men may feel empowered by this new, regal moniker, painting their stature in a positive light, and finally allowing them to break free of toxic stereotypes about masculinity. However, other men might prefer that nobody comment on their height at all, since it may still be a sore subject for them, especially if their height was a cause for bullying or ridicule during adolescence. [4] X Research source When it comes to calling someone a short king, it’s best to err on the side of caution so as to not insult anyone. “Short king” should be reserved for close friends and loved ones who know you won’t take offense."

Actually, it’s more common than ever to see short kings dating tall queens . Short king poster boy Tom Holland snagged tall and statuesque Zendaya, but he’s certainly not alone in his success. Here’s a list of famous short kings, some of which may surprise you: [5] X Research source Kendrick Lamar —5 foot 6 Daniel Radcliff —5 foot 5 Tom Cruise —5 foot 7 Zac Efron —5 foot 8 Mark Ruffalo —5 foot 8 Cillian Murphy —5 foot 7 Oscar Isaac —5 foot 8 James McAvoy —5 foot 7 Robert Downey Jr. —5 foot 8 Mark Wahlberg —5 foot 8"

      "content": "“Short kings” are confident and attractive, regardless of height. If you’re somebody who identifies as a short king, more power to you! It’s important to remember that confidence is a state of mind, unrelated to height, appearance, financial status, or anything of the sort. If someone doesn’t want to date you based on your stature, then it’s their loss. So, if you happen to be 5 foot 8 or less, stand tall and proudly in your short king-dom. Who knows? Your Zendaya could be out there!"
