      "content": "Switch off the water before you start. Either turn off the water valve specifically for the shower, or shut off the water supply at the main line, which is usually on the outside of your house or in the basement. Simply switch off the water and then turn the shower on, which allows any remaining water to flow out. [1] X Research source Balkan says “every plumbing fixture,” like a shower or toilet, “typically [has] their own dedicated valve” that is located near the fixture. If the water supply handle is round and looks like a wheel, turn the handle clockwise (right) to switch it off. It will take around 2 full turns. If the water supply handle is a lever, give the handle a 1/4 turn, where it will stop. Note : The knob replacement process is the same if you have 3 or more shower knobs."

      "content": "Remove the decorative covers on the knobs. Jeiranyan says there’s usually “some type of cover that covers…the screw that holds [the knob] in place.” Simply push a flathead screwdriver beneath the cover plate on the knob. Then, gently lift the screwdriver handle away to pop the cover off. You can use a utility knife instead of a flathead screwdriver. [3] X Research source If the cover plate is stuck, use a handle puller to remove it. You can find these at your local hardware store."

      "content": "Unscrew the screws in the center of the knobs. Use a Phillips screwdriver to remove the screw in the knob. Jeiranyan says to turn the screwdriver counterclockwise (left) to twist the screw out. It will fall out quickly, so be ready to catch it. Place the screw in a plastic bag or small bowl and set it in a safe space so it doesn’t get lost."

      "title": "Take off the knobs to reach the valve stems.",
      "content": "Take off the knobs to reach the valve stems. Twist the knob counterclockwise as you pull it toward you to remove it from the shower valve. It should twist off easily with a bit of wiggling and pulling. [4] X Research source If the knob seems to be stuck on the valve, give it a few very light taps with a hammer on the outside, where you hold it to turn it. This loosens any mineral deposits but won't damage the knob. Tip : Label each valve so you know which one controls the hot and cold water. For instance, write an “H” on a piece of tape and place it under the correct valve."

      "title": "Purchase new knobs that are the same size and brand as the old ones.",
      "content": "Purchase new knobs that are the same size and brand as the old ones. Take the old knobs and screws with you to your local hardware or plumbing store and show them to the salesperson. Jeiranyan says they will be able to help you match new shower knobs to your old fittings, ensuring that you get the right brand and size. Alternatively, get a universal faucet handle . This is a great option if the store doesn't sell your particular brand. Most shower knobs cost between $5 to $40, depending on the materials they’re made of and who they’re made by. Shower knobs are made from many different materials, so find some that match the other fittings in your bathroom, such as the showerhead and taps. For instance, brass, plastic, and chrome are common materials."

Jeiranyan says that generally, the cold water knob is on the right and the hot water knob is on the left. If your old shower knobs were previously the wrong way around, this is a good opportunity to switch them. Tip : If the shower valves are dirty, wipe them with a shower cleaner ."

Then, twist the hot and cold knobs on to ensure that water comes out and it’s the right temperature. Also, check that the knobs don’t leak. [6] X Research source If there is a water leak, remove the knob cover and tighten the screw again. If you turned off the main water supply , turn it back on slowly: For round handles, make ¼ of a rotation and pause for a few seconds. Keep turning the handle ¼ of the way open and pausing until the valve is fully open. [7] X Research source For lever valves, turn the lever ⅛ of a turn and wait for a few seconds. Then, turn it the rest of the way until it's parallel with the water pipe."

      "content": "Turn the water off before you begin. Switch off the main water supply line to your house. Or, turn off the valve that controls your shower, if you have access to it; it’s usually located near your shower. Then, turn the shower on to drain out any residual water inside the pipes. [8] X Research source This prevents you from getting accidentally soaked if you turn the handle while you are replacing it. The main water supply is usually in your basement or located outside near the exterior of your house. If the main water supply handle is a wheel, switch it off by turning it clockwise for 2 full turns. [9] X Research source For main water supply handles that are levers, turn the lever ¼ until it's at a right angle to the pipe (perpendicular). You won’t be able to turn it at this point."

Simply use a utility knife or screwdriver to press under the cover and flick it off. [10] X Research source The knob cover goes over a hole in the shower handle where the screw is. Some showers don’t have a covered button for this hole, and in this case, you won’t have to remove one. Just find the small hole on the top or underside of the handle. Tip : Place a cloth over the shower drain in case the cover or any small parts fall. This prevents them from getting stuck in the drain."

Simply insert a Phillips head screwdriver or hex/Allen key into the screw within the hole. Then, twist the screwdriver or key counterclockwise to remove the screw. Simply pull and twist the handle off. Use the long end of the Allen key, as the hole can be quite deep. It only takes a few full twists of the handle to pull it away."

Put the old handle and screw into a plastic bag and show it to a salesperson at your local hardware or plumbing store. They will be able to show you what faucet handles are compatible with your old shower fittings. [11] X Research source If the store doesn’t sell handles from the same brand, look for a universal faucet handle instead, which can fit onto most fittings. Choosing a new shower faucet that’s compatible with your old fittings makes it easier to replace and install yourself. Note : If you get a knob that’s incompatible with your old fitting, you may need to replace the shower valve , which often requires extensive plumbing work. Shower knobs are made from many different materials, including brass, plastic, zinc alloy, and chrome. Match your new handle to the other fittings in your bathroom, such as the showerhead and taps. Brass is usually the most expensive option, but it typically lasts the longest, while plastic is the most inexpensive option."

However, some new handle sets may come with a spacer that you insert before you push the new handle on. Just fit the spacer into place inside the handle as per the instructions that came with your set first. Then, push the handle onto the valve. [12] X Research source Fitting the new handle depends on the type and brand of faucet that you have. So, follow the instructions that came with the handle to install it correctly. Tip : Use a shower cleaner to wipe off the shower valve if it is dirty before putting on the new knob."

Make sure you slowly turn the water supply back on. For wheel-shaped handles, pause after turning it ¼ of a revolution until the line is fully open. For levers, turn it ⅛ of a turn, wait a few seconds, and then turn it back to the original position so it’s parallel with the pipe. [16] X Research source"
