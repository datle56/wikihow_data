      "title": "Learn Tajweed rules.",
      "content": "Learn Tajweed rules. Tajweed is an Arabic word meaning ‘proficiency’ or ‘doing something well’. It is also known as elocution. It teaches you how to pronounce certain words so that you can recite the Qur'an properly. Every letter is pronounced specifically from a certain part of the mouth, and it is obligatory to recite the Qur'an as it is written, and if you apply all the rules of Tajweed, then that is much better. The Qur'an says, Or add to it, and recite the Qur'an with measured recitation , which implies reading the Qur'an with Tajweed or with care."

      "title": "Take each rule one at a time.",
      "content": "Take each rule one at a time. There are many rules in Tajweed, and it can be daunting to memorize them all. Luckily, some Qur'ans are color-coded to help you identify some of the Tajweed rules. However, you should take your time when learning Tajweed; learn a specific rule, then practice using that rule."
    },
    {
      "title": "Pay attention to what you are reciting.",
      "content": "Pay attention to what you are reciting. If possible, have a translation copy so you can understand the meaning of the Qur'an. Make sure you recite the Qur'an in a quiet, clean place, where there will be no distractions."
    },
    {
      "title": "Do not be afraid of mistakes.",
      "content": "Do not be afraid of mistakes. For some non-native Arabic speakers, perfecting the sounds of some letters and words can be very difficult. However, it takes time to master Tajweed, and if you persevere and put effort, you will get the reward of trying. This was narrated by the Prophet (peace be upon him), who said: \"The one who is proficient in the recitation of the Qur'an will be with the honourable and obedient scribes (angels) and he who recites the Qur'an and finds it difficult to recite, doing his best to recite it in the best way possible, will have a double reward.\""
    },
    {
      "title": "Start from short chapters.",
      "content": "Start from short chapters. Don't push yourself too much, so start with short chapters, such as Chapter 114 (An-Nas). Start with small chapters, pay attention, follow the rules and recite gently. If you can, listen to an audio recorder of a Qari (reciter) reading it, so you can follow along and take lessons from their recitation."
    },
    {
      "title": "Take time out.",
      "content": "Take time out. Leave about half an hour out of your daily schedule to read the Qur'an. If you don't put effort into it, you'll never be able to recite the Qur'an perfectly. So when you do get a chance to read it, make full use of it. Limit any distractions and do not rush."
    },
    {
      "title": "Listen to famous reciters.",
      "content": "Listen to famous reciters. They are people who have studied under the most renowned scholars and who have dedicated their life to the study of Tajweed. The more you listen and imitate them, the more you will master reciting the Quran. Try to listen to the likes of Saad El Ghamidi, Abdul Rahman Al Sudais, Mishary Rashid Al-afasy, and Abdul Basit Abdus Samad. Their voices are distinct due to their Tajweed and the melody with which they recite the Qur'an."
    },
    {
      "title": "Learn the meaning.",
      "content": "Learn the meaning. Put your soul and emotion into reading the Qur'an, and be humble when reading the words of Allah. Try to learn some of the Arabic words that are used throughout the Qur'an, and definitely read the translation to understand what is being said."
