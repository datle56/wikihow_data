[3] X Expert Source Kristin Pulaski Salon Owner & Nail Specialist Expert Interview. 19 May 2020. Clipping your nails will help the acetone dissolve the acrylics more easily. This may take some time, depending on the size of your nails and how much product is on them, so sit tight and persevere. Take care not to file or damage your natural nail as you do this."

      "title": "Apply petroleum jelly to the skin surrounding your nails.",
      "content": "Apply petroleum jelly to the skin surrounding your nails. Acetone is hard on skin, so it's important to protect your fingers. Rub a generous amount of petroleum jelly on the tips of your fingers and the cuticles–even up to the first knuckle, if you’re feeling especially cautious. [6] X Research source Be careful not to apply the petroleum jelly to the nails themselves, which may hinder removal. Use a cotton-tipped wooden applicator if you need help applying the petroleum jelly more precisely."

Place a cotton ball in the center of a tin foil square, then place the 2 together on top of a nail, with the cotton ball touching the nail. Then, wrap the tin foil around your nail to secure the cotton ball. Repeat this for each nail. [7] X Expert Source Kristin Pulaski Salon Owner & Nail Specialist Expert Interview. 19 May 2020. You can use a non-plastic tape to fasten the cotton balls if you don't have aluminum foil–acetone will dissolve plastic tape! You can also simply soak your nails in a bowl of acetone for 30 minutes if you know that acetone doesn't irritate your skin."

      "content": "Take the foil bundles off your nails after 30 minutes. Unwrap the tinfoil and gently but firmly pull the cotton ball and acrylic away from your natural nail. The acetone has loosened the acrylic from your nail, and the acrylic nail will come away without much fuss. [8] X Research source If you soaked your acrylic nails in the bowl of acetone, gently pry the nails off using an orange wood stick. If the acrylic nails are still firmly stuck, repeat the process and let your nails soak for another 20 minutes and attempt to remove them again."

      "content": "Sand off the leftover acrylic and shape your nails with the nail filer. The acrylic will be soft from the acetone bath, so take the opportunity to buff the rest of it away, until there’s no more residue left on your nails. Then, use nail clippers and a nail file to smooth the sharp edges and round out your nails. After, buff your nails lightly with a fine-grade nail buffer, moving from the base of the nail to the tip, to give them a nice, smooth sheen. [9] X Research source If the acrylic begins to harden again while you're buffing, use a cotton ball soaked in acetone to dampen it. To avoid damaging your nails, file in one direction only, and avoid using a back-and-forth sawing motion. The top few layers of your nails may have been removed with the acrylic. Buff and file gently so as not to tear or damage them further when file and buff them."

      "content": "Pry up the bottom edge of an acrylic nail with a floss pick. Use a floss pick or a cuticle stick to gently lift the edge of the nail closest to your cuticle. Insert the pick between the acrylic nail and your natural nail, and loosen as much of the acrylic nail as possible. [11] X Research source When using this method, work slowly and carefully. Removing acrylic nails without chemical assistance (like acetone) may cause damage to your nails. Soak your nails in acetone using the acetone method for easier removal with dental floss."

      "content": "Slide the floss under the loosened edge until the nail comes off. Use the floss end of the pick, and slowly and gently move the floss back and forth in a sawing motion. As you work, apply slight pressure in the direction away from your cuticle in order to work the floss along the underside of the acrylic nail. Continue this way until the acrylic nail comes off, and repeat the process for each nail. [12] X Research source Use another finger to hold the base of the nail in place so that it doesn’t wiggle uncomfortably as you floss it away. You can also use standard floss, but you may need a partner to help you."

      "content": "File away the top coat and polish with the electric filer. Set your electric nail filer to about 12,000 rpm (rotations per minute). Then, carefully lower the filing bit to the base of the nail, just below the cuticle. Graze the filer across the surface of the nail, so that a thin layer of polish, color, or whatever product is applied to the nail is sanded away. Continue to do this, following the contour of the nail. [15] X Research source Move the filer in one direction–towards you–as opposed to moving it back and forth across the nail."

      "content": "Use light, rapid back-and-forth motions to remove the acrylic. Once you’ve filed away all the product applied to the acrylic nail, begin to make swift, gentle, brushstroke-like movement across the surface of the nail to remove as much acrylic as possible. When you begin to see the natural nail beneath, reduce the filer’s rpm to about 7,000, and continue to remove as much acrylic as possible. [16] X Research source Once the nail is suitably thin, clip the excess acrylic off the tip of the nail. If at any time you become uncomfortable using the electric filer, opt to use the acetone method to soak off the rest of the nail. It’ll be much easier with much of the acrylic removed already."
