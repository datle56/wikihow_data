      "content": "Get a clean, empty plastic bottle. A bottle with a plain top and sides will work the best, but you can use other types too if you don't mind the molded designs. For the most realistic trophy though, you should use a 1.5 to 2-liter (50.7 to 67.6-fl oz) soda bottle. Make sure that the bottle is empty and clean. If it's dirty, fill it with water, then add a pump of dish soap. Close the bottle, shake it, then pour the water out. Make sure that you remove the label as well. If there is any residue, use a goo-removal product to get it off, such as Goo Gone."

      "title": "Use a craft blade to cut the top, domed part off of the bottle.",
      "content": "Use a craft blade to cut the top, domed part off of the bottle. Plastic bottles have a dome on the top that eventually straightens out to become the sides. You need to cut around the bottle just before the domed part starts to straighten out. [1] X Research source If the cut part turns out jagged, trim it down with scissors to make it nice and smooth. Some plastic bottles have a molded line just under the dome. Use this as a guide."
    },
    {
      "title": "Cut the bottom off of the bottle to create the base.",
      "content": "Cut the bottom off of the bottle to create the base. Find the molded line near the bottom of your bottle, then cut along it with a craft blade. If there is no molded line, measure up 2 to 3 inches (5.1 to 7.6 cm) from the bottom of the bottle, then draw a line around it. Use this line as a cutting guide. [2] X Research source If you prefer, you can use a small, plastic tub for the base instead. Choose something that is 2 to 3 inches (5.1 to 7.6 cm) tall, and a little wider than your bottle. Cut it shorter if it's too tall. [3] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Slice the middle segment of the bottle open.",
      "content": "Slice the middle segment of the bottle open. You should now have 3 separate pieces: a top, middle, and bottom. Take the middle, cylindrical part of the bottle, and cut straight down the side, from top to bottom. [4] X Research source This will eventually make the stem. It should be long enough to fit the width of your hand. If the stem is too long, trim the top or bottom edge until it is the right length."

      "title": "Overlap and glue the cut edges to make a smaller tube.",
      "content": "Overlap and glue the cut edges to make a smaller tube. Take your middle segment and let it roll back into its original cylindrical shape. Gently squeeze it in your hand until the cut, vertical edges overlap and form a narrower tube. Glue these edges together to help the tube keep its shape. [5] X Research source How narrow you make the tube is up to you. It should be wide enough to fit the neck of your bottle, however. This is typically a little over 1 inch (2.5 cm). Super glue will work the best for this, but you can use hot glue instead."

Cover the bottom edge of your tube with hot glue, then press it against the middle of the base. [6] X Research source Hot glue sets up fast, but you still should hold the tube while the glue dries. For a stronger bond, use an industrial-strength glue, such as E6000."

Working quickly, before the glue sets, flip the domed bottle top upside down, then slide the neck into the tube. [7] X Research source Keep sliding the neck into the tube until the domed part of the bottle touches the tube. You can take the cap off first, or you can leave it on. If you take it off, however, you can use this trophy as a pencil holder! You can use industrial-strength glue for this step too. Be sure to let the trophy dry overnight, however."

Apply 1 coat of paint first, wait 10 to 20 minutes for it to dry, then apply a second coat and let it dry too. [8] X Research source Apply acrylic craft paint with synthetic taklon brushes. Avoid bristle brushes (too coarse) and camelhair brushes (too soft). If you are using spray paint, be sure to work in a well-ventilated area. Apply the paint from 6 to 8 inches (15 to 20 cm) away. If you want a more elaborate trophy, consider painting some words or designs onto it, such as \"#1\" or \"Champion!\" [9] X Research source Alternatively, draw your designs with hot glue before you paint the trophy. This will give you nice, raised designs."

Let the second coat dry too. [10] X Research source The exact size of the paper cups does not matter, as long as they are both the same size. Apply acrylic craft paint with a synthetic taklon paintbrush. Don't use a bristle brush (too coarse) or a camelhair brush (too soft). Hold the cup from the inside while you paint it. If you want to use spray paint, set the cups down in a well-ventilated area. Apply the paint from 6 to 8 inches (15 to 20 cm) away. Work on the next step while the paint is drying to save time."

Unfold the shape, then cut it apart along the crease to get 2 identical handles. [11] X Research source Cardstock will work the best because it is nice and stiff, but you can use regular printer paper or construction paper too.

Set the handles down on a larger sheet of scrap paper, then apply your paint. Let the paint dry, then flip the handles over and paint the back. Let the back dry as well. [12] X Research source You don't want to use too much paint for this step, or the paper will turn soggy and warp. Alternatively, you can color the handles with a gold or silver marker. It won't be the exact same color as the cups, but it will be close enough. Do the next step while the paint is drying."

If you don't have hot glue, you can try tacky glue, but it will take much longer to dry. Alternatively, you can place the bottoms of the cups together, then wrap a piece of double-sided tape around the seam. This will allow you to stick on sequins! [13] X Research source"

Add a strip of double-sided tape to each tab, then press the handles against the cup. [14] X Research source If you don't have double-sided tape, you can use hot glue or tacky glue.

If you wrapped double-sided tape around the middle of the trophy, stick some sequins to the tape. Don't use rhinestones; they are too heavy and will fall off.

Take 1 ribbon and thread it through the left handle. Fold the ends of the ribbon down, then glue them to the bottom of the handle. Do the same thing for the second ribbon and right handle. [16] X Research source Hot glue will work the best. If you want to use tacky glue, you'll have to pin the ribbons in place with a clothespin until the glue dries. You can also try double-sided tape. If the ribbon is fraying too much, you can singe the cut ends with a flame. If you are a child, ask an adult to help you. Satin ribbon about 1 ⁄ 2 to 1 inch (1.3 to 2.5 cm) wide will work the best. Red or blue are traditional colors, but you can pick any color you want."

[20] X Research source You can find plastic animal (and many other non-animal) figurines in toy stores, dollar stores, and craft stores. For a Lombardi trophy, use a mini (American) football.

For a Lombardi trophy, you could write the number 49 in Roman numerals (XLIX).
