From 2024 to 2034, employment growth is projected to be concentrated in jobs where a degree is required while growth in jobs where a degree isn’t required is expected to stagnate.

The cost of college can be a huge factor when deciding whether to go or not, and unfortunately, it has continued to rise over time. The average cost of college is $38,270 per year, including books, supplies, and daily living expenses. However, this annual cost rises to $45,708 if you want to go out of state. [19] X Research source However, only about 1 in 6 students pay this “sticker price.” This is partly because of an increase in scholarships and the federal Pell Grant, which gives money to low-income students. [20] X Research source Research also indicates that a four-year student who enrolls at age 18 can expect to earn enough by age 34 to compensate for the costs.

If you’re not sure, try taking a gap year after high school. During that time, explore different careers and interests to figure out what you want to do. A 4-year college isn’t your only option, either. Look into jobs that a trade school, apprenticeship, or community college can help you break into."

[36] X Research source Pros: They tend to be cheaper and have smaller class sizes and an easier application process than 4-year colleges. In addition, many jobs on the market only require a 2-year degree.

[38] X Research source Pros: You get specialized skills for high in-demand jobs in a shorter timeframe than at a 4-year college. Trade schools also tend to cost less than a college education.

Her Advice: “If you're not really passionate and excited about attending college, it might not be the right path for you.
