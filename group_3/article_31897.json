  "steps": [
    {
      "title": "“Morning.”",
      "content": "“Morning.” If you’re feeling casual, it’s okay to shorten “Good morning” to just “Morning.” Of course, your tone will say a lot here—a mumbled “Morning” sends the signal that you need a little more time to wake up, while a sing-song “MORN-ing!” shows that you’re feeling cheerful. You can also shorten “Good morning” to “G’morning.” It’s a little warmer than just “Morning,” but still comes across as casual."
    },
    {
      "title": "“It’s nice out this morning.”",
      "content": "“It’s nice out this morning.” If you’re out and about, greet someone with a pleasant comment about the weather for a polite, casual way to say “Good morning.” It’s okay to acknowledge if the weather isn’t great—just keep your tone cheerful and your greeting will seem warm. You can also say things like: “Brr, it’s chilly out today!” “Did you see that beautiful sunrise?” “Morning—looks like rain today!”"
    },
    {
      "title": "“How did you sleep?”",
      "content": "“How did you sleep?” Asking someone how they slept can be a nice way to start your conversation. However, this is better saved for someone you know well, like a family member or a close friend—it might seem a little personal for someone you’re not especially close to. You might also say: “Good morning, I hope you slept well!” “I slept great last night.” “I stayed up too late last night!”"
    },

      "title": "“Rise and shine!”",
      "content": "“Rise and shine!” This cheerful greeting is the perfect way to wake someone up. It encourages them to “rise” and “shine” like the sun, helping them get their day off to a good start. You could also say, “Good morning, sunshine!”"

    },
