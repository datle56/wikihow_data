[1] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Popping a blister may lead to an infection and slow the healing time, so it’s best to leave it alone.

If the blister is in a location where it’s highly probable that you’re going to pop it on accident, or the blister is causing you persistent pain, popping it yourself may be the ideal option. In most cases, if you’re careful and do this safely, you can pop the blister at home. [4] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source If it’s mild pain and you can live with it for a bit, you’re probably better off leaving the blister alone. If you’ve got a blister on the bottom of your foot, on your hand, or on your ankle and you can’t skip shoes or wear sandals for a few days, it’s probably going to pop anyway."

If you get sunburn or you burn yourself on accident and a blister develops, do not pop it.

Hemophiliacs, diabetics, and people with a compromised immune system typically shouldn’t do this, but it really depends on your personal situation.

Adjust your body so that the blister is visible and steady. Then, slide the needle into the blister just above the point where it meets the undamaged skin around it. Keep the tip of the needle pointed slightly away from your body to avoid puncturing yourself. Use a clean cloth or paper towel to soak up any fluid that comes out. [13] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source You don’t need to push the needle all the way through the blister. Just insert the needle far enough that fluid starts coming out and then pull it out carefully. If you can’t reach the blister, you may need to enlist some help for this bit.

However, it’s going to take much longer for your blister to heal if you pop it. On top of that, you’ll have to change your dressings out daily so it’s going to be a lot more work if you pop it as well. [15] X Research source You may be able to speed up the healing process if you don’t touch the blister, you keep it uncovered, and you don’t continue the activity that caused the blister to appear in the first place. In other words, if you developed blisters after 3 days of jogging, take the week off!"

You can pick these up at your local pharmacy, although you may need to ask the pharmacist to retrieve them for you.

These liquids are released when you injure or irritate your skin. It’s just your body’s natural way of making sure further injury doesn’t occur.

Blood blisters look scary, but they aren’t uniquely dangerous.
