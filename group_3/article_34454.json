      "title": "Purchase sprinkler donuts for each sprinkler in your lawn.",
      "content": "Purchase sprinkler donuts for each sprinkler in your lawn. Sprinkler donuts wrap around your sprinkler heads when they are inactive as an added layer of protection. They are made of various materials, like plastic or concrete. Find a donut the right size for your sprinkler heads. [2] X Research source Sprinkler donuts can be purchased at any lawn care store or online. Lightweight materials like plastic will float away after heavy rains."

Go all the way around the donut so it is easier to remove the grass. [4] X Research source Use a long-handled tool so you can put a foot on the donut and so it does not shift while you are cutting."

      "title": "Remove the grass and dirt from the area.",
      "content": "Remove the grass and dirt from the area. Move the donut off of the area you’ve cut. Use the spade or a hand trowel to loosen the turf plug that you cut away. Once it’s loose and mostly removed, use your hands to clear any remaining dirt or grass from the area. [5] X Research source Be gentle with whatever tool you choose. You do not want to damage the sprinkler in the middle."

      "title": "Place the donut in the hole.",
      "content": "Place the donut in the hole. Push the donut in with your hands so it is packed into the dirt. To make sure the donut is firmly in place and will not move, push with your foot to compact the dirt further. Make the top of the donut flush with the top of the soil. [6] X Research source Since you cut along the edges of the donut, there should not be extra space that you need to fill in after you install the donut."

      "title": "Mow over the donut as normal.",
      "content": "Mow over the donut as normal. Since the donut surrounds the sprinkler and it is flush with the grass, there should be no problem running a mower over the area. Be mindful of where the tires are when you mow the lawn so they do not run over an unprotected sprinkler. If you don’t feel comfortable mowing over a sprinkler, use a weed whacker instead."

      "title": "Clean grass cuttings from the donut after you mow.",
      "content": "Clean grass cuttings from the donut after you mow. Unless you bag your grass clippings, there will be leftover cuttings in the center of the donut. Before you run the sprinkler system again, remove the clippings with your hand, or use compressed air or a leaf blower to push the grass out. Some donuts have sloped interior walls so that clippings and debris slide away from the sprinkler head so it is less likely to get clogged."

      "content": "Use a sprinkler head trimmer to clear the grass if it grows over your sprinkler. Sprinkler head trimmers can be purchased at any lawn care or garden store. Push the circular end of the trimmer into the ground and twist. The trimmer will cut any grass that has grown around or over your sprinkler that your mower may not have reached. [8] X Research source Sprinkler head trimmers come as a smaller handheld tool or as a long-handled tool. Either will work. An electric trimmer will work the most efficiently, but it will cost more money."

You may have to rub it with a clean cloth or your fingers to clean it entirely. [12] X Research source Don’t use chemicals or cleaners. Residue may stick in the filter screen and then be sprayed across your lawn. A soft-bristled toothbrush can help clean your sprinkler heads."
