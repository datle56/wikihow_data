      "content": "There may not be enough airflow around your PS5. Make sure the area you keep your PS5 in is a cool area. Keep it away from any other devices that give off heat. Make sure there are a couple of inches on all sides of your PS5 to allow for air to flow to keep your PS5 well-ventilated. You may also want to consider keeping your PS5 in an open area, such as on top of a cabinet or off to the side, rather than inside a media cabinet where it may collect dust."

      "content": "The cooling system doesn't work as well in the vertical position. The PS5 is designed to stand on end in the vertical position or lay flat in the horizontal position. However, the PS5 uses a liquid metal cooling system that transfers heat from the CPU to the heatsink. When the PS5 stands in the vertical position, it causes the liquid metal to pool at the bottom of the CPU. This can cause dry spots on the CPU where heat will build up. Furthermore, in some cases, this can cause the liquid metal to leak and damage other internal components. Place the PS5 in the vertical position to avoid problems with the liquid metal cooling system. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "The ventilation system could be blocked by dust and debris. The most common reason for a PS5 overheating is a build-up of dust and debris in the ventilation system. First, use a dry brush and a vacuum hose to clean any dust accumulating in the vents on the top sides of the PS5. Then remove the panels on top and bottom and use a brush and vacuum hose to clean the fans inside the PS5. It's recommended you take the time to clean the vents and fans at least once per month."
