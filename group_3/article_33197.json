[1] X Research source On the front of the recorder, the top three holes are designated for three fingers from your left hand: the finger above your middle finger (pointer), your middle finger, and the finger below your middle finger (ring). The bottom four holes are for the four fingers of your right hand (the right thumb is not involved). The hole in the back is where your left thumb goes. [2] X Research source"

The song only uses three simple notes: B, A, and G, so it’s easy to learn without having to teach yourself to read music. \"Hot Cross Buns\" is divided into four measures (also called bars), which are sections that help you keep track of where you are in the song. The first, second, and fourth measures are all identical and play as B A G. The third measure looks like GGGG AAAA. [4] X Research source"
