Use ↓ to brake, and keep holding to drive in reverse. ← leans backward, and → leans forward. Use these controls to move over obstacles, when piloting a two-wheeled vehicle."

Keep exploring, and have a laugh when you die."

You can try alternating Shift and Ctrl immediately after you eject to walk, but this is a difficult challenge. Oddly, the easiest character to control while walking is the wheelchair guy.

Make sure to select the objects and uncheck the \"fixed\" button, or they will not swing or move. With an object selected, press C to copy it, then V to create a new copy. Use Shift V to paste it at the exact same spot it was copied. To test your level, press T . During the test run, press F to mark the position of the character in the level editor.
