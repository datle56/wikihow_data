      "content": "Decide if participants will compete individually or in teams. Think about the format of the quiz show, including the number of participants, the subject matter of the competition, and how the quiz show will be run. Start by determining how you will organize the participants in the quiz show. Ask yourself, Will the participants compete as a team or as individuals? [1] X Research source You may think about how many participants you would like to have in the competition and then determine if teams or individual competitors make more sense. Having large teams may be fun if there are going to be a lot of participants, while individual competitors may be ideal if there are only going to be a handful of participants. You may opt for teams if you are trying to get the participants used to working as a group. This may be a good way to encourage social interaction among friends or teamwork among a class of students. You may also break up the quiz show into sections or heats, where teams compete against each other in heats. Then, whichever teams win the heats face each other in the final round of the competition."

You may create strict rules around how competitors play against each other, including pressing a buzzer or raising a hand when they have the answer to a question. You may also note how the competitors earn points in the quiz show. [2] X Research source For example, you may have a rule where the competitors earn five points for every question they answer correctly. Then, if there is a tie at the end of the competition, there is a sudden death match where competitors answer difficult questions as fast as they can. You may also allow for the stealing of points from an opposing team if a team member does not answer a question within a certain timeframe."

Or you may use materials from other sources, such as scholarly journals or pop culture articles, to create content for the quiz show.
