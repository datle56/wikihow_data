If you want to sell products on your website, you'll need a host that offers e-commerce tools, such as Woocommerce If your main interest is blogging, you'll want a web host that offers a convenient blogging platform like WordPress.

Many web hosts even offer packages that include discounted domain names with the purchase of a web hosting plan (or vice-versa). If you want to buy a domain name before you decide on a web hosting provider, you can get one through a domain registrar service. Some popular options are Network Solutions , Google Domains , GoDaddy , and NameCheap . If you already have a domain name, you can transfer it to your web host, or simply contact the service that hosts your domain name to request that they point your domain to your new home on the web. If you find a domain you like but it's already taken, you can put in a backorder request with the registrar. This means that if the domain isn't renewed by its current owner, you can bid for it. You can also use a broker to reach out to the domain name holder."
