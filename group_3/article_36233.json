      "content": "Soak a damp rag in water and acetone unless you’re working on a car. If the metal is painted, spot test the acetone in an innocuous area before proceeding to confirm it won’t damage anything. Take a clean rage and run it under warm water. Wring the excess water out and then pour a spoonful of acetone on to the cloth. For cars specifically: Follow these instructions, but use toluene instead of acetone, which will almost certainly strip your vehicle’s paint job. Some people have had success getting Flex Seal off of cars with WD-40 or Goo Gone . You can try using one of these products instead of toluene. Just FYI, acetone is the same thing as nail polish remover."

      "title": "Scrub the surface with your rag.",
      "content": "Scrub the surface with your rag. Drag the acetone-soaked section of the rag back and forth along the metal. If the Flex Seal hasn’t had time to cure, it should lift off of the metal pretty quickly. If it has cured, you may have to use a fair bit of elbow grease. [5] X Research source Reload the cloth with more water and acetone if you feel like your rag starts to lose its efficacy."

      "title": "Scrub the area with a clean rag or cloth.",
      "content": "Scrub the area with a clean rag or cloth. Work the mineral spirits into the cloth or wood using a clean rag, paper towel, or cloth. The Flex Seal should come up relatively quickly. If it doesn’t, continue to work the spirits into the surface. [7] X Research source With clothing specifically, if the Flex Seal has fully cured, you’re going to have an extremely difficult time getting it clean. It may take multiple rounds of scrubbing to get the Flex Seal up. Depending on how long the Flex Seal has been allowed to dry, you may not be able to remove it entirely from your clothes.
