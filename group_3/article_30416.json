      "content": "Manifestation works the best when your desire is super specific. Are you looking for a new boyfriend or girlfriend? A fiery summer fling? A future spouse to start a family with? Be really honest with yourself and consider what you truly want. The more detailed and authentic your desire, the more likely it is to come your way. [1] X Research source Focus on the “what” you want and not the “how” (that’s for the universe to decide). Write down what you want or create a vision board with images that represent your future relationship. Physically creating something puts your manifesting in motion."

      "content": "Jot down everything you can think of, no matter how small or silly. Again, specificity and honesty are essential to bringing your manifestation to life. [2] X Expert Source Jennifer McVey, Cht Spiritual Director Expert Interview. 21 December 2021. What does your partner do for work? How’s their sense of humor? What are they passionate about? The clearer your perception of them, the easier it will be to find them. Handwrite your list with a pen and paper instead of typing it out. [3] X Expert Source Jennifer McVey, Cht Spiritual Director Expert Interview. 21 December 2021. The universe tends to reciprocate physical acts of doing or creating something. Keep your list somewhere private where you can return to it later. Your list isn’t set in stone and you can revise it as you gain clarity on your wants. We can’t predict who we fall in love with, so it’s OK if you don’t have a lot of physical or visual traits about your partner on your list. Focus on how they make you feel or what they add to your life. Always include the date when you're writing your manifestations down.

      "content": "Let yourself dream and fantasize about life with your perfect partner. What activities do you do together? Where do you live? What do you like to talk about? Meditation is a great way to paint a clearer picture for yourself: close your eyes, focus on your ideal romantic future, and let yourself feel what your perfect love feels like. [5] X Research source Try writing down a few notes about your perfect love on a piece of paper. Read it over a few times before bed and keep it under your pillow while you sleep. [6] X Research source If you created a mood or vision board, spend a few minutes each day looking at it and meditating on your intent."

      "content": "Imagine where you’ll be a few months to a year from now. It’s unlikely you’ll have found your soulmate or had your dream wedding in such a short time, but maybe you’ve gone on more dates than normal or gotten more confident talking to new people. Congratulate yourself on the attainable progress you’ve made towards your goal as if it’s already happened. [7] X Research source A letter to your future self is a powerful way to heighten your self-awareness and let the universe know you’re serious about finding love. When you’ve finished your letter, spend time reflecting on your life now. Are you on track to meet these goals by the time you open your letter? What can you do to get there?"

      "content": "How do you feel when you’re with your dream partner? Chances are you’re not obsessing over finding someone or doubting your ability to be loved. Let go of your insecurities over being single. Amp up your self-care routine, explore your hobbies and interests, and do things that make you feel authentic and empowered. Try things like: Introducing yourself to new people with confidence Buying and wearing things because you like them, not because you want to be noticed in them Feeling secure with a night in on the weekends"

      "content": "Manifestation is a chance to get “unstuck” and break negative cycles. You won’t manifest something new if you keep doing the same old ineffective routines. Make changes in your life to show the universe you’re ready to co-create a new life and remember that you have the power to get what you want. [8] X Research source Some old habits to change might be: Agreeing to go on dates with people very unlike your dream partner (saying “yes” to the wrong people only shows the universe that that’s what you want) Ruminating on your flaws with negative self-talk Using alcohol or drugs to help you talk to people"

Eventually you might aim to go on 2 dates per week or communicate your feelings more openly. Keep your end goal in mind and only take actions that will bring you closer to your dream partner. [9] X Research source Try: Editing your bio or changing your photos on a dating app Practicing making friendly small talk with different kinds of people Taking a new route to work or going to different bars and coffee shops to run into new people"

      "content": "The universe rewards people who stay grateful and humble. Acknowledge all the positive things happening for you, no matter how small.

[10] X Research source Practice gratitude by: Writing in a gratitude journal every night about the good things that happened to you that day or moved you closer to your dream partner Saying 3 things you’re grateful for before you go to bed each night Meditating on what you’re grateful for for a few minutes each day"

      "content": "Let go of negative experiences that taught you you don’t deserve love. If you don’t believe it, the universe won’t manifest it. When you work through the emotional damage or trauma that holds you back, you’re able to love as your whole self with a blank slate. Remember you can achieve anything if you believe in yourself! [11] X Research source Counter negative thoughts (“I’m too old,” “I’m not successful enough”) with positive affirmations (“I deserve love my whole life,” “I’m satisfied with what I’ve accomplished”). Consider therapy or counseling for help dissecting past trauma that’s impeding on your goals and to learn new coping skills. Let go of people who have hurt or disappointed you in the past. Stay optimistic about the new, wonderful people waiting to enter your life. The key to manifestation is being aware that you are a powerful creator spirit who is able to create your own life.

[14] X Expert Source Jennifer McVey, Cht Spiritual Director Expert Interview. 21 December 2021. Other things, like knowing if the cute barista that smiled at you is your soulmate, are murkier. [15] X Research source Look for things like: Any mention of your desires in print or pictures you come across Overhearing someone talk about goals similar to yours Feeling unexplained sparks of joy or excitement As you get better at manifesting, you may notice it happening faster and faster.

As you grow as a person, you might discover you need or want something different than what you originally thought. That’s OK! Update your actions and practices to best suit your intentions. [17] X Research source Examine what you’ve accomplished and what you still need to do. What changes can you make to get there? If your manifestation isn’t working, revisit the original type of love or partner traits you envisioned. Did you leave something out? Were you dishonest with yourself or including things that other people expect for you? Are there any fears holding you back?"
