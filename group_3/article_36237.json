      "title": "Turn up the heat in your car.",
      "content": "Turn up the heat in your car. Windshield fog occurs when the temperature outside the car doesn’t match the temperature inside the car. Therefore, if it’s hot outside, increasing the temperature inside your car can help remove the fog. If it’s cold out, turning on the heat still helps because it pulls moisture out of the air so the fog will evaporate. [1] X Research source If it’s too hot to turn the heat on, at least turn down your air conditioner. This will warm up your car and get the inside air temperature to match the outside a bit better."

      "title": "Turn on your air conditioner if it’s cold outside.",
      "content": "Turn on your air conditioner if it’s cold outside. Decrease the temperature inside your car to better match the temperature outside. Set your air conditioner to the lowest setting you can handle and point the vents toward your windshield. This will decrease condensation so the fog will fade more quickly. [2] X Research source This is the fastest method but also the coldest, so be prepared to shiver a bit!"

      "title": "Crack your windows.",
      "content": "Crack your windows. Crack your windows to allow fresh air to circulate in your car. Doing this helps the temperature inside your car match the temperature outside of your car, which should help reduce condensation. If it’s humid out, be careful not to open your windows too much, or you may let in moisture from the outside, which could create even more fog. [3] X Trustworthy Source Consumer Reports Nonprofit organization dedicated to consumer advocacy and product testing Go to source Beery says, “Do NOT open the car windows if the outside temperature is at or below freezing. This can cause the fog on the inside of the windows to fog over, making matters much worse.” [4] X Expert Source Ed Beery Automotive Specialist Expert Interview. 19 November 2021."

      "title": "Turn off the recirculation button.",
      "content": "Turn off the recirculation button. When attempting to defog your windshield, make sure to turn off the recirculation button on your dashboard. This allows fresh air to enter your car, which in turn helps reduce moisture and clear fog. When recirculation is on, the air inside your car is the only air being circulated, meaning the moisture level will stay the same. [6] X Trustworthy Source Consumer Reports Nonprofit organization dedicated to consumer advocacy and product testing Go to source Look for a button that has a little car with an arrow pointing inside the car. This is typically what the recirculation button looks like. If recirculation is already turned off and your windshield is fogged, try turning it on instead."

      "title": "Use your car’s defogging feature.",
      "content": "Use your car’s defogging feature. If your car has a defogger option, turn it on to remove fog from your windshield. These vents are typically located on both ends of the dashboard. This feature is especially helpful if your rear windshield is fogged. [7] X Research source Not all cars have a defogging feature. If you aren’t sure if yours does, check your owner’s manual. The defrost button works the same way, and many people use them interchangeably."

Baking soda is a natural dehumidifier, so it’s a great way to reduce moisture in your car and get rid of windshield fog. [10] X Research source Fill a small jar with baking soda and place it in your car without the lid to soak up moisture. Alternatively, sprinkle some baking soda on a clean cloth and wipe it on your windshield."

      "content": "Place silica balls in your car. Like baking soda, silica balls are another affordable and effective way to reduce excess moisture in your car. Place some silica balls in a sock, tie the end, and put it in your car, preferably on your dashboard near your windshield. Replace the sock when the silica becomes too wet, as it will no longer be effective. [11] X Research source When silica reaches its saturation point, it becomes too wet to absorb any more moisture. If this moisture seeps into the sock, it could potentially lead to a mildewy odor, so replace your silica and your sock regularly to prevent this."

      "title": "Wipe your windshield with shaving foam.",
      "content": "Wipe your windshield with shaving foam. Though it may sound odd, using shaving foam is a common DIY hack for removing fog from car windshields. Use a clean towel to smear a handful of shaving foam (not gel) on your windshield. Let it sit for about two minutes, then wipe it off with another clean towel. The shaving foam creates a thin, invisible film on the glass to lower surface tension and prevent water from condensing on the surface. [12] X Research source This is also a great way to prevent your windshield from fogging up in the first place, as it creates a moisture barrier on the glass."

      "content": "Windshields fog up due to temperature differences inside and outside your car. When the temperature outside is colder than the temperature inside your car, or vice versa, moisture condenses on the windshield, causing it to fog up. This also happens if there are high humidity levels inside your car or if it is very humid outside. [13] X Research source Beery says, “The fog on a windshield is condensation which occurs when moisture condenses on the warmer side of a surface, in this case, the car windows. The temperature difference determines on which side of the windshield the condensation collects.” [14] X Expert Source Ed Beery Automotive Specialist Expert Interview. 19 November 2021."

      "content": "Can I wipe the fog away with a cloth? It generally isn’t a good idea to wipe fog away with a cloth alone. While using a cloth to apply vinegar or shaving foam can sometimes prevent fog, if you just use a cloth to wipe the fog away, it will likely cause streaks on your windshield, which will impair your vision. Aim to use your car’s defroster instead.

      "content": "Why is my windshield fogging up on the outside? Car windshields typically fog up on the outside when there is a significant difference between the temperature inside your car and the temperature outside. This causes moisture to condense on the glass, creating fog. [23] X Research source If the fog is on the outside of your windshield, Beery says, “Turn the defroster onto the warmest setting with the fan on the highest setting. Ensure that the recirculation button is off to help equalize the inside and outside temperatures. Turn on the rear window defogger if you have one. Turn your windshield wiper on to wipe the windshield as additional condensation forms. [24] X Expert Source Ed Beery Automotive Specialist Expert Interview. 19 November 2021."
