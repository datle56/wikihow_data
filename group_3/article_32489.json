      "content": "The Peaky Blinders haircut is an undercut that’s shaved on the back and sides. Each Peak Blinders character has a different style on top, but they all have a variation of the undercut. [1] X Research source Peaky Blinders cuts also have a fade, referring to hair that grows shorter down the sides until it seems to fade into the skin. [2] X Research source The Peaky Blinders haircut is historically accurate. Known as an undercut or textured crop, the haircut originated in Glasgow with the Neds gang. It was also popular with the Peaky Blinders and other early 20th-century street gangs in England because long hair was considered dangerous during a street fight. [3] X Research source"
