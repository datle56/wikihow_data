      "content": "Gather relevant information. To find court records, you will need to know basic information about the court case. A court may have heard thousands of cases over the past few years, so you will need some identifying information so that the clerk can pull the correct file. Try to gather as much of the following as possible: the case number the name of one or both parties to the lawsuit what kind of lawsuit it was (civil, family, criminal, probate, etc.) when the lawsuit was filed"

      "content": "Visit the courthouse. Although court records are public, some smaller courthouses still only have paper copies available for inspection. Even larger courthouses may have uploaded to the Internet only documents related to newer cases. If you want to find court papers for a case, then you will have to get the paper copy. Accordingly, you should stop into the courthouse and ask the court clerk how you can get a copy of a court record. Tell the clerk you want to see the whole case file. There should be photocopiers available to photocopy. Bring some money as you probably will have to pay to make copies."

      "content": "Perform a web search. You might also want to look on the web for court documents. A surprising number of court documents have shown up on the Internet over the past few years. If you are looking for documents in a court case involving a large corporation, the complaint and other documents could be on the web. To search, type the name of the lawsuit (if you have it) or the name of the company and “lawsuit.” This type of general web search will probably not work for lawsuits involving private citizens (instead of large corporations)."

      "content": "Understand the life cycle of a case. A typical civil lawsuit is initiated by filing a complaint. [3] X Research source In a criminal case, the case is started with the filing of an indictment. After the case has started, then the parties can bring various motions. Pre-trial motions. In the months leading up to the trial, each party will file motions asking the judge to do something. There are many kinds of motions. Generally, parties file motions to have the case dismissed or to compel the discovery of documents or other information. Trial exhibits. If something is submitted during the trial as an exhibit, it should be included in the file. However, you probably will not find trial transcripts in the record unless one party took an appeal. Rulings. These should appear soon after the relevant motion. The judge will rule on a motion soon after it is brought. Accordingly, if you find a motion in the court file, then you should look for the court’s order to appear shortly thereafter. Judgment. The judgment is the disposition of the case. It tells you who won and who lost. For this reason, it comes near the end of the case file. If one party takes an appeal or if the parties argue over attorneys’ fees, then these documents will appear after the judgment."

      "content": "Find the record you are looking for. Now that you have a general sense of the life cycle of a trial, you should be able to find the documents you are looking for quite easily. If you want to see what actions a person was accused of, then search for a copy of the complaint or indictment, which is at the beginning of the file. If you want to see what a judge decided at a hearing, look toward the middle of the file. Likewise, if you want to see which party won the lawsuit and how much they were awarded in money damages, then look toward the end of the file. Even a short case can generate hundreds of documents, so you should be prepared to scroll through the entire list of documents in order to find exactly what you are looking for. Each document should be listed with a heading, e.g., “Defendant’s Motion for Summary Judgment.”"

      "content": "Read the court document. Court documents are generally easier to read than legislative statutes. At the top of most documents should be the caption, which lists the parties, the case number, and the name of the court. Sometimes the judge is also named. [5] X Research source The motion should have a title below the caption. For example, a motion for summary judgment should be titled as such. Make sure the document is actually what was described in the hyperlink. You can then read the document. Make sure you know who the Defendant is and who the Plaintiff is, otherwise you might get confused. Check the caption to confirm the identities of the parties."
