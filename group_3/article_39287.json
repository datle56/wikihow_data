Pour the sprouts into a colander to drain the water. [1] X Research source Brussels sprouts typically don't collect a lot of dirt, but any dust or sediment attached to the vegetable will sink to the bottom."

      "content": "Trim the end of each sprout and pull off the outer leaves. Holding the top end firmly against a cutting board, cut a thin slice off the root end of each sprout with a sharp chef's knife or paring knife. The tough outer leaves will start to flake off. Remove any leaves that are bruised, dried-out, or tough. Stop when you reach fresh, tender leaves. [2] X Research source Since they're spherical, sprouts are prone to rolling off the cutting board and onto the floor. Keep them in a bowl unless you're actively trimming the end to prevent them from falling."

      "content": "Fit your food processor with its slicing attachment. Place the metal slicing disc on top of the food processor bowl, fitting it over the shaft inside the bowl. Then, fit the plastic lid on top of the slicing disc. [3] X Research source If your food processor didn't come with a slicing attachment, you can shred your sprouts using just the S-blade. Cut each sprout in half lengthwise, then add them to your food processor and pulse once or twice. It won't result in as fine a shave, however. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Empty the processor, then continue shaving in small batches. Empty out the shaved sprouts into a large bowl, then fit the lid back on the processor. Turn it back on and shred another batch of Brussels sprouts. Repeat until you've shaved them all. [6] X Research source A food processor is the fastest method of shaving Brussels sprouts, so it works well for a large volume of sprouts."

      "content": "Slice off the woody stems and discard the outer leaves with your hands. Using a sharp chef's knife or paring knife, cut a thin slice off the bottom of each Brussels sprout. The tough outer leaves will start to come off. Remove any leaves that are bruised, dried-out, or tough until you reach the inner, tender leaves. Once you've sliced off the stem, you can transfer the sprouts to a lidded container for a quicker method of removing the outer leaves. Close the container and shake vigorously until the majority of the outer leaves have fallen off. You may have to remove a few stragglers by hand. [8] X Research source"

Keep the Brussels sprouts in a bowl until you're ready to slice them in half, since they are prone to rolling off the cutting board and onto the floor. A sharp knife will make this process easier and safer. Sharpen your knife if you haven't recently."

Hold your hand like a claw and push your knuckle against the knife blade to keep it from cutting your fingers. To keep the sprouts from rolling around the cutting board, make sure you've placed them so the flat side is facing down while you slice. [9] X Research source"

A mandoline is a flat kitchen tool that features a sharp stationary blade in the center, typically used for slicing vegetables. Spearing the sprout with a fork is a safe, easy way to slice it while keeping your hands away from the mandoline blade. [11] X Research source You can also use a no-cut glove to protect your hand from getting cut by the blade. In that case, there's no need to use the fork—simply hold the sprout by its root end and slide it back and forth over the mandoline by hand. [12] X Research source"
