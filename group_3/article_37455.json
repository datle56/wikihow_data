      "title": "Put the pen in boiling-hot water for 5 minutes to avoid using flames.",
      "content": "Put the pen in boiling-hot water for 5 minutes to avoid using flames. If you’re worried about burning yourself or your pen, use hot water to warm up the ink. [1] X Research source Heat some water to boiling in a kettle or in a pan on the stove, then pour it into a mug. Set the pen tip-down in the water for about 5 minutes, then test it out on a piece of paper. If your pen has any metal components, dry them thoroughly to prevent corrosion. You can also take the pen apart and soak just the cartridge if you don’t want to get the barrel of the pen wet."

      "title": "Warm the pen with a blow dryer or craft heat gun for gentler heating.",
      "content": "Warm the pen with a blow dryer or craft heat gun for gentler heating. If you’re worried that an open flame or boiling water will be too harsh, warm the nib and cartridge with a hair dryer on a high heat setting. For slightly more powerful heating, you can also use a craft heat gun or embossing gun. Warm the nib of the pen for a few seconds at a time, then try writing with it. [2] X Research source Don’t use an industrial heat gun! They get extremely hot and will probably melt your pen."

      "title": "Hold the tip of the pen to a flame for a few seconds to unclog the ink.",
      "content": "Hold the tip of the pen to a flame for a few seconds to unclog the ink. Use a lighter, match, or candle to create a flame, then place just the very tip of your pen in the flame for a few seconds. In many cases, the heat will melt any gummed-up ink near the tip and get the pen working again. [3] X Research source Be careful not to burn yourself or melt the pen. Hold just the very tip of the nib in the flame, and don’t do it for longer than 2-3 seconds. If you’re worried about melting the barrel of your pen, remove the cartridge first. That way, it’s easier to just heat the nib of the pen. Scribble on some paper right away to get the ink moving and check if your pen works."

      "title": "Dab a little spit on the nib to lubricate the ball.",
      "content": "Dab a little spit on the nib to lubricate the ball. This may sound gross, but spit can act as a lubricant or gentle solvent to help unclog the tip of your pen. If you’re hesitant to actually lick the nib of your pen, put a little spit on your fingertip or a napkin and dip the pen tip in that. Then, scribble on a piece of paper to see if you can get the ink flowing. Ballpoint pen ink is generally not considered toxic, so don’t worry about getting sick from licking the pen. Any mildly toxic components, such as glycols, are present in such small amounts that they won’t cause any harm."

      "title": "Dip the point of the pen in rubbing alcohol to dissolve clogs.",
      "content": "Dip the point of the pen in rubbing alcohol to dissolve clogs. If some of the ink is dried out in the pen, you might be able to get it going by thinning it a little with rubbing alcohol . Pour some alcohol into a cup or bowl and dip the pen into it, then scribble on a piece of paper to see if you can get it flowing again. [5] X Research source Most ballpoint pens have oil-based ink, which is part of the reason it’s so hard to get ballpoint stains out of clothing. Solvents, such as alcohol, are better at thinning oil-based ink than plain water."

    {
      "title": "Try acetone if alcohol doesn’t work.",
      "content": "Try acetone if alcohol doesn’t work. Acetone is a more aggressive solvent that might unclog your pen if alcohol isn’t strong enough. Dip the nib of your pen in a little bit of acetone-based nail polish remover and see if that does the trick. [6] X Research source Acetone releases harsh fumes, so always use it in a well-ventilated area. Try to dip only the very tip of the pen in the acetone, since acetone can damage many types of plastic. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Scrape the nib on a rubber surface to get the ball rolling. When scribbling on paper doesn’t work, sometimes you can get a stuck ball moving by rubbing the pen on a rubber surface. Scribble on a rubber eraser or even the sole of your shoe. [8] X Research source Alternatively, some people find it helpful to scribble on a glass surface (such as a hand mirror) to get a stuck ballpoint pen going again. [9] X Research source"

      "title": "Shake the pen to move the ink down in the cartridge.",
      "content": "Shake the pen to move the ink down in the cartridge. Sometimes a ballpoint pen will stop writing because there’s a space or bubble between the ink in the cartridge and the nib. Hold the end of your pen opposite the nib and give the pen several firm shakes, as if you were shaking down an old-fashioned glass thermometer. When you’re done, give it a scribble to see if it works. [10] X Research source You can also try tapping the pen firmly on a hard surface, like the edge of a desk or table."

      "title": "Push the ink down in a wide cartridge with a cotton swab.",
      "content": "Push the ink down in a wide cartridge with a cotton swab. If your pen has a wide enough cartridge, you may be able to push the ink down toward the nib. Unscrew the barrel of your pen and take out the cartridge, then pull the cap off the end of the cartridge. Push a cotton swab into the cartridge and apply gentle pressure to the fluid inside. Put your pen back together and test it again. [11] X Research source If the cartridge is too narrow to fit a cotton swab in, use a smaller object, like a paperclip. If the cotton swab gets ink on it, toss it in the trash right away so that the ink doesn’t spread around and stain anything."
