Don’t be obvious about the full moon to your friends, but do make sure they notice it — while you’re walking you can just say “Wow, the moon is so huge tonight!” or something like that."

Do this after you’ve been walking for a while — at least 10 or 15 minutes — otherwise your goal (the prank) might become obvious. Note that it’ll have to be a larger group in order for you to disappear easily. Aim for at least 3 other people: the more the better. If you can’t find a good time to slip away, tell your friends you need to pee and that they can keep walking — you’ll catch up."

You might start by making a low howling noise from where you’re hiding — low enough that they’re not totally sure they’ve heard it. If you don’t think you can make a good howling noise, maybe play one on your smart phone or some other recording device. After making the howling noise, remain hidden while you run past them. If you’re on a tree-lined street or in the woods, run quick and loudly, being sure that they hear your footsteps. If it’s very dark, you may need to move more slowly to avoid tripping and falling. If you can’t get close to them without them seeing you, throw large rocks towards (not at) them instead. You can also snap branches in your hands. These thudding and snapping sounds should startle your friends, too."

When they ask what’s wrong, tell them that you think you saw something in the woods — that it looked kind of like a large wolf. Say that you felt it brush past you. To heighten your story, you might even rub a small amount of fake blood on your wrist. If you do this, don’t mention it. Just rub your wrist lightly as if it’s in pain, and if your friends ask about it, say you think you must have scratched it on something while you were running away."

Dog-like things might include sniffing at food before you eat it or scratching at the couch to make it more comfortable before you sit down on it. You’ll also get your friends wondering what’s wrong if you act weird whenever they mention that night where you supposedly saw the wolf.

Another thing you could do is get your friend who’s in on the prank to tell your friends he saw you go into a certain space — an abandoned house or a creepy schoolyard, or the woods, for example. Your friend can bring your other friends there, and you can hide then jump out at them wearing a werewolf mask."

You can even make the howling sounds get louder right before you jump out and scare them. Don’t forget to make sure you reveal yourself as a werewolf on the next full moon — your friends might still get scared if it’s not a full moon, but a full moon will be the most effective time to reveal yourself as a werewolf."
