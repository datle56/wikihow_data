Keep wiping down the board with your clean towel until it no longer picks up dirt and dust. Always use gentle, soft towels or paper towels. Never use abrasive pads or scrubbers!"

      "content": "Never use abrasive or scratching motions to clean a whiteboard. The non-porousness of the board is what allows the ink to come off easily, as a clean, Teflon-like coating protects the board from letting ink set in. [6] X Research source But scratches and \"tears\" in this coating will allow the ink to seep through, ruining your board permanently. Always use soft, clean towels and rags. Adhesives like tape and glue will also rip up the coating when removed."

      "content": "Use whiteboard cleaner and a dry towel at the end of every week to keep the board clean. Regular cleanings will be essential to prevent the need to restore the board in the first place. A light spray of cleaner and a towel will remove marks before the set in, keeping your board beautiful for years to come. Any marker left on for more than 24 hours is at risk to leave \"ghost\" marks. Very stubborn stains can be removed with a little propyl alcohol. Or, you can prepare a mixture that is 50 percent tap water and 50 percent isopropyl rubbing alcohol. Wipe the whiteboard, then dry it off with a clean cloth to remove alcohol remnantsâ€”don't let alcohol dry on the board. [7] X Research source"

Work quickly, then erase with a dry, clean eraser to get most of these marks off. Note, if you work too slowly you may dry the black marker on there, completely defeating the purpose! You can also use this method to spot clean certain marks. Just make sure they are completely covered with ink before erasing. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Never use degreasers, soap, or cleaners not specifically formulated for dry-erase boards. Most soaps break up oils and sheens that are not water-soluble, helping cut through tough stains and chemicals. But the sheen on a whiteboard is there on purpose, allowing the markers to write without ever truly drying out. Never use a cleaner that isn't made to specifically work with your white board. In a pinch, denatured alcohol can work as a more powerful cleaner than water, and it shouldn't harm whatever original finish you have left."

      "content": "Know that restoration will only work so many times before you need a new board. If someone has ruined the finish with a heavy cleaner, or you find that you have to add WD-40 more and more frequently, you'll likely hit the end of the line with your board. While you can try to resurface it again, you'll likely be best off with a new, factory sprayed finish. WD-40 will make the board usable again, but it may also lead to slightly streaky writing. It is nothing that makes the board unusable, but it should be noted."
