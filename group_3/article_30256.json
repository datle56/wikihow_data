      "content": "Scoop the flesh out of 4 avocados if you want to make avocado candy. Place the avocados on a chopping board and use a sharp knife to cut them in half. Use a metal spoon to dig out the pip, and then scoop the flesh into a bowl. [1] X Research source If possible, use ripe avocados. Soft, green flesh signals that an avocado is ripe. The creamy texture of the avocados will help to give the ice candy a smooth consistency. If you want to make fruit-flavoured ice candy, skip this step."

      "content": "Place all the ingredients into the blender. Measure 4 cups (950 mL) of milk, 14 ounces (400 g) of sweetened condensed milk, and ½ cup (100 grams) of sugar into the blender. Transfer the flesh of the avocados from the bowl into the blender, or add 5.8 ounces (165 gram) of fresh or frozen fruit instead. [2] X Research source If you don’t have a blender, use a food processor instead. Any fruit will taste delicious in this ice candy recipe. Popular varieties include mango ice candy and strawberry ice candy, but you can also try cantaloupe and sweet vegetables like ube."

      "content": "Dissolve 2 cups (250 grams) of cornstarch in a bowl of milk and cold water. Measure 1.5 litres (0.40 US gal) of cold water and 1 cup (240 mL) of milk into a bowl. Mix the ingredients with a spoon until the cornstarch is no longer visible. If you want a richer flavoured ice candy, use condensed milk instead of regular milk. Use full-fat milk for a creamy taste or low-fat milk for a lighter texture. In some countries cornstarch is known as corn flour."

      "content": "Pour the cornstarch mixture into the boiling water and stir for 2 minutes. Use a wooden spoon to combine the ingredients. Keep stirring the mixture to avoid any lumps from forming. If the mixture stops boiling, turn up the heat. Stir this mixture for 2 minutes or until it's thickened, says personal chef Jennifer Levasseur. Be careful when you pour the cornstarch mixture to avoid splashing the boiling water. Set a timer to remind you when 2 minutes have passed. Levasseur cautions that if you boil cornstarch for too long, it will break down."
