      "content": "Know that an A requires 3 different fingers on three different strings. For A Major (or simply \"A\"), you strum every string but the topmost one. A basic A Major chord is simply a straight line with your pointer, middle, and ring fingers on the 2nd fret, playing the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th strings from the bottom. Looking down at the guitar in your lap and starting with the thickest string: Leave the top string \"open,\" which means there is no finger on the fret. Leave the next string open as well Place your pointer finger on the next string between the first and second fret. The first fret is the one closest to the head of the guitar. Place your middle finger between the first and second fret. Place your ring finger between the first and second fret. Leave the bottom most (high E) string open."

The bottom string, which is the thinnest string on your guitar, is the 1st string. The next one up is the 2nd, and so on until you get to the 6th string, the heaviest one. A helpful mnemonic for the order of the strings is E very B oy G ets D inner A t E ight, since the strings, from the bottom up, are EBGDAE. [1] X Research source The 1st string, the thinnest, is the High E. The 2nd string is a B. The 3rd string is a G. The 4th string is a D. The 5th string is an A. The 6th string, the thickest, is the Low E."

      "title": "Understand fretting.",
      "content": "Understand fretting. Frets are the little metallic bars along the neck of the guitar. Pushing down a string in between two frets changes the note of the string, and each fret marks out the intervals between changing notes. The 1st fret is closest to the head of the guitar, the small piece at the end of the neck where all the strings are tied to the tuners. If a song calls for a note on the 1st fret, you would put your finger down in the space between the head and the first fret. If it calls for a note on the 2nd sting, 5th fret, you place you finger in the space between the 4th and 5th fret, on the 2nd string. Each fret represents a half-step, musically. So the 6th string (top string), 4th fret is a G# (sharp), the 5th fret an A, the 6th an A sharp, etc. Try and place your finger close to the fret for the best tone. For example, if you want to play a note on the 2nd fret, try and keep your finger as close to the second fret as possible without crossing over it or being on top of the fret. You are still between the 1st and 2nd fret, just closer to the 2nd. [2] X Research source Tableture is guitar's version of sheet music , and simply uses the number of the fret instead of notes. It is incredibly helpful to learn if you want to learn the frets."

If you are having trouble making it sound clean: Practice curving your fretting fingers upwards so that the pads on your fingers don't drag on other strings and muffle them. Press down firmly with the tip of your fingers. It may hurt for the first 2-3 days, but your fingers will quickly adapt. Make sure you are close enough to the fret. At the very least, keep your fingers 3/4 of the way from the 1st fret to the 2nd. [3] X Research source"

A barre chord, called such because you \"bar\" your index/pointer finger flatly across 5-6 strings at once, is used in many songs because you can move it quickly up and down the neck to get new chords. The chord is named after the topmost note that you play, which is also where you bar your finger. Since the 5th fret on the 6th string is an A, you start there for your A Major chord."

      "content": "Recognize that an Open A is actually a hidden barre chord. You don't have to bar all of the strings, however, because they are open. This means that you can play a much higher pitched version of the chord as a barre chord further down the neck. At the 12th fret, all of the open notes repeat, so the 1st string/12th fret is an E, 2nd string/12th fret is a B, 3rd string/12th fret a G, etc. Thus, by barring your pointer finger over the 12th fret and using your ring finger to bar the 14th fret you get an A Major chord that is bright and high. You may have to sacrifice the 1st string, 12th fret E to make this work, as it is hard to bar the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th strings at once and still leave the 1st string uncovered. All of the variations mentioned for Open A chords apply as well, as long as you add 12 frets to each diagram (open strings, or 0 fret, → 12th fret, 2nd → 14th, etc.)."
