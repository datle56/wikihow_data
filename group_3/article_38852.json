      "title": "Choose your curlers.",
      "content": "Choose your curlers. The size of your rollers will determine the size of your resulting curls. Larger rollers will create larger curls and waves, while smaller rollers will create tight pin, spiral or bouncing curls. Don't forget to consider the length and weight of your hair when choosing your rollers. Long and thick hair will naturally result in looser curls than short, fine hair. The ideal type of rollers will also vary based on how you plan to set the curls. For example, hook-and-loop fastener rollers will be easier to set using a hair dryer, but if you plan to sleep in the rollers, you'll be more comfortable with sponge or bendy rollers."

      "title": "Wash your hair.",
      "content": "Wash your hair. Shampoo your hair thoroughly and rinse. Use a sulfate-free shampoo to prevent dryness and keep your curls from frizzing up. Use conditioner if that's part of your general hair-care routine. Rinse completely and gently towel dry. If you want to use leave-in conditioner, now is the time to apply it. Comb through wet hair so there are no tangles."

      "title": "Prepare hair for setting with a styling product.",
      "content": "Prepare hair for setting with a styling product. Apply a styling product so your hair will better hold the curls once they are set. Remember, where there is more product, there is generally more hold. Choose from mousse, gel, hairspray or even thermal-activating setting spray. You can customize your curls by spraying just the ends of your hair for curls at the bottom, or spray the roots and underneath for voluminous waves."

      "title": "Section your hair.",
      "content": "Section your hair. Part the hair into 3 sections, 1 on top and 1 on each side of your head, leaving the back hair loose. Placing curlers in 1 of these sections at a time will make the process much easier. Pin sections down with long hair clips."

      "title": "Begin rolling the topmost section of hair.",
      "content": "Begin rolling the topmost section of hair. Split each of the 3 sections into smaller sections about the width of your roller and no more than 2 inches thick. You will ultimately roll the sections in the direction you want the hair to fall. [1] X Research source Secure the hair between 2 fingers. Now, smooth the ends of the hair around the roller, holding them down until the roll is started. Continue rolling until you get to the scalp. Repeat with the next roller section, duplicating what you did with the first. You may find it easier to roll your hair uniformly around the roller if you wrap the ends in end papers. This can be especially helpful for short hair. If you wish, you can use larger rollers for the top sections, then gradually move down in size as you get toward the bottom of the head. This will create looser waves on top, and tighter curls toward the bottom. For a more uniform look, use rollers of the same size all over. Trying to roll a section of hair that's too large may prevent curls from forming."

      "content": "Choose the direction of the curls. Keep in mind what direction you want the curls to fall, toward or away from your face. Place the roller on whichever side youâ€™ve chosen, and wrap from there. For most hairstyles, rollers on the top of the head will be rolled backward, away from the face. [2] X Research source If you want curls that don't fall uniformly, roll the hair in various directions. If you roll some sections of hair forward and some sections of hair backward, your curls that look more natural. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Roll the hair on the sides of your head.",
      "content": "Roll the hair on the sides of your head. Start on either side of the top and put the hair in rollers. For most hairstyles, the side rollers will be rolled in a downward direction. [4] X Research source Move from the top of this side section to the bottom of it (at the ear area). If you are using multiple sizes of rollers, begin to use gradually smaller rollers at the bottom of this section of hair, ending with the smallest you use. If you want an outward flip at the bottom of your hairstyle, roll the bottom curlers in an upward direction. [5] X Research source Go to the other side section and repeat."

      "content": "Divide the back area into 3 sections, if it is not already done. Roll from the top of each section of hair to the bottom. If you are using multiple roller sizes, make sure you use smaller rollers as you near the neckline for all of these sections."

      "content": "Allow rolled hair to completely dry. Sit under a hair dryer for 30 minutes before checking to see if your hair is completely dry. Remove 1 roller first to be sure it is dry. If not, add 10 to 15 minutes with the hair dryer before removing the rollers. The longer and thicker your hair is, the longer it will take to dry completely. If sleeping on your rollers, don't remove them until morning. Be sure and test 1 roller before removing the rest."

      "content": "Remove the rollers. Unwind 1 roller at a time when your hair is completely dry. Work slowly to avoid tangling your hair. You'll find it easiest to remove the bottom rollers first and work your way up to the top sections of hair."

Be careful not to overdo it, since your curls should keep their shape for 2 or 3 strokes, but any more might cause them to fall out. You can also use a pick or simply run your fingers through the curls to separate them and add some volume."
