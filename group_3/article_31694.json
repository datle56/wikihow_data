      "title": "Recharge or replace the batteries if you don’t have your override key.",
      "content": "Recharge or replace the batteries if you don’t have your override key. Some digital safes have a keypad for your passcode as well as an override key that can unlock the safe. If your electronic keypad has run out of power, and you don’t have your override key, replace the batteries that power the keypad or recharge the keypad. [1] X Research source If you don’t have your override key, you can access your digital safe is by using the electronic keypad."

      "title": "Look for the battery casing on the keypad and open it up.",
      "content": "Look for the battery casing on the keypad and open it up. Search near or on the keypad for the battery casing. It can usually be found on the underside of the keypad. Use your finger to hold the latch and remove the casing to expose the batteries. [2] X Research source Some digital safes may require you to remove a small screw to access the battery casing. Check to make sure the battery casing isn’t damaged or the pieces are falling out. If so, you may need to take your safe to a professional to have it opened."

    {
      "title": "Replace the batteries with the same type and voltage.",
      "content": "Replace the batteries with the same type and voltage. Once you’ve opened the battery casing, take out the existing batteries from their slots. Install the same type of batteries into their slots the same way the previous ones were installed. Then, close the battery case latch. [3] X Research source The keypad may light up or lights may turn on once you restore power to it."

    {
      "title": "Plug in a power supply connection if your digital safe has one.",
      "content": "Plug in a power supply connection if your digital safe has one. If your safe has a USB slot or a slot for a power cord, or a 9-volt battery on the keypad, plug in an electrical cord or battery that fits into it. Allow the keypad to charge for at least 10 minutes before you try to access the safe so it has a chance to build up a power reserve. [4] X Research source If your safe has a USB charging port, it will accept any USB charging cord. Your safe may have a specific power cord used to charge the keypad, but you may be able to find a cord that fits into the charging port. There should be a charging light that comes on or a light behind the keypad that is activated when you plug a power supply into it."

      "title": "Enter your passcode to open your safe once power is restored.",
      "content": "Enter your passcode to open your safe once power is restored. Once the keypad has power, try entering your passcode. The locking mechanism will disengage and you’ll be able to open and access your digital safe. [5] X Research source If you’ve forgotten your passcode, try resetting it."

      "content": "Locate the back panel of the electronic element of the safe. Look for small holes or openings on the back or the bottom of the safe. Shine a flashlight through the holes and look inside for the backside of the control panel. [6] X Research source There will be wires and electrical components on the back of the control panel."

      "content": "Insert a wire coat hanger through one of the holes of the safe. Take a wire coat hanger, unwind it, and straighten it out so it’s a long, thin wire. Slide the end of the wire hanger into 1 of the openings so you can access the control panel. [7] X Research source Be careful not to jam the wire hanger into the opening or you could potentially damage the electronic keypad and be unable to reset it."

      "content": "Press the reset button on the inner keypad of the safe. Using your flashlight to guide the wire, look for the reset button on the backside of the control panel. It should be a small, black button with the word “Reset” next to it. Push the button with the end of the hanger. [8] X Research source You may hear a beeping sound or the control panel may light up when you press the reset button."

      "content": "Enter a new passcode on the front of the keypad. Once you’ve pressed the reset button, you’ll be able to enter a new passcode on the front of the keypad. Type in a code that you know you’ll remember on the keypad. [9] X Research source Write down the code or save it into your phone so you won’t lose it!"

      "content": "Confirm the new code by pressing the set button next to the reset. Shine the flashlight through one of the openings and look for a button next to the reset button labeled “Set.” Press the button with the end of your wire to confirm the new passcode that you entered. [10] X Research source The control panel may beep or light up after you confirm the code. The set button may not be labeled or it may have a checkmark on the front of the panel."

      "title": "Insert a knife into the keyhole and shake it to pop the lock open.",
      "content": "Insert a knife into the keyhole and shake it to pop the lock open. If your digital safe has a keyhole, stick the pointed tip of a sturdy knife into it. Shake and wiggle the knife to force the locking mechanism to disengage. Then, open the door of the safe. Shaking the lock open will more likely work for cheaper safes. This solution may work well on a combination key and digital keypad safe."

      "title": "Insert a screwdriver into the keyhole and turn it to break the lock.",
      "content": "Insert a screwdriver into the keyhole and turn it to break the lock. Place the safe on a flat surface and insert a flathead screwdriver into the keyhole. Rotate the screwdriver counterclockwise over and over until you hear or feel the locking mechanism break open. Then, remove the screwdriver and open the safe. You may not be able to lock the safe again after damaging the locking mechanism with a screwdriver."

Drill through the key slot on the safe until you penetrate all the way through, which will disable the locking mechanism. You can then open the safe door. [12] X Research source"
