      "content": "Soak the gold in warm water and dish soap. Fill a bowl with warm—not hot—water and mix in a few drops of a mild dish soap, like Dawn. Submerge your gold into the mixture, and allow it to soak for a few minutes. To remove scratches, consider adding a few drops of ammonia to the mixture as well, but don’t let the gold soak for longer than a minute. [1] X Research source If your gold jewelry also has gemstones, skip this step, as submerging the piece could damage or loosen the gems. It’s better to use a brush to clean the gold around the gems instead. Do not use any soap other than mild dish soap, as the ingredients may tarnish or otherwise damage the gold. Similarly, avoid using chlorine (like in chlorine bleach), as this can permanently damage and discolor gold. If you choose to add ammonia, be sure to wear gloves and avoid contact with your skin."

      "title": "Scrub the gold with a soft-bristled toothbrush.",
      "content": "Scrub the gold with a soft-bristled toothbrush. A new, baby-sized soft-bristle toothbrush is ideal. Gently scrub the gold to remove dirty and grime; it isn’t necessary to apply much pressure. Make sure to get into the crevices of the gold, and avoid scrubbing gemstones if there are any. [2] X Research source Remember, gold is a soft metal, so applying too much pressure could scratch or damage it."

    {
      "title": "Rinse the gold in lukewarm water.",
      "content": "Rinse the gold in lukewarm water. Fill another bowl with clean, lukewarm water and submerge the gold to rinse it off. Make sure all the dirt, grime, and soap residue has been removed. Inspect the gold to see if you’re happy with the outcome. If not, repeat the cleaning process until you’re satisfied. [3] X Research source If your gold has gemstones, dampen a soft cloth to rinse away the residue rather than submerging the piece in water."
    },
    {
      "title": "Dry the gold with a soft cloth.",
      "content": "Dry the gold with a soft cloth. For the best results, use a lint-free cotton cloth to gently pat the gold dry. Avoid using paper towels or other rough materials to dry the gold, as they may scratch the surface. If you don’t have a soft cloth available, allow the gold to air dry. [4] X Research source Young says to “Make sure it's dried very well. You don't want to leave either residue or sitting water on the surface of jewelry.”"

    {
      "title": "Wipe the gold with a jeweler’s cloth to finish polishing.",
      "content": "Wipe the gold with a jeweler’s cloth to finish polishing. Use a polishing cloth to gently wipe off the surface of the gold to remove any remaining debris. If there isn’t any debris or dust left, go over the piece a few times to further brighten the gold. [5] X Research source Purchase a jeweler's cloth online, at a jewelry store, or at some supermarkets, like Walmart."
    },
    {
      "title": "Fully polish gold only once or twice a year.",
      "content": "Fully polish gold only once or twice a year. Polishing gold jewelry too often can remove a thin layer on the piece’s surface, which may weaken and wear down your jewelry over time. To avoid this, do a full polish only once or twice a year. It’s okay to use a polishing cloth to do a touch-up every few months, however. [6] X Research source If you’re just cleaning the gold rather than polishing, it’s generally okay to do so every 2-3 weeks to remove dirt and oil build-up."

    {
      "title": "Take your gold to a jeweler if it’s very scratched or tarnished.",
      "content": "Take your gold to a jeweler if it’s very scratched or tarnished. Polishing your gold at home should be enough if it’s just a bit dirty or dull. If it has deep scratches, loose gemstones, or is particularly old or delicate, however, it’s best to visit a jeweler to have it professionally cleaned. Jewelers can also examine the gold for additional damage. [7] X Research source If your gold jewelry also has gemstones, it’s recommended to visit a jeweler so you don’t accidentally damage the gems while attempting to polish the gold."

      "title": "Store gold away from direct sunlight.",
      "content": "Store gold away from direct sunlight. Prolonged exposure to direct sunlight can cause gold to fade or become discolored. This is especially true if your gold piece contains alloys of other metals. To keep your gold looking its best, store it in a dry place away from direct sunlight. A jewelry box or pouch may be best.

      "title": "Do not get gold wet.",
      "content": "Do not get gold wet. Water can damage gold, especially if it’s exposed to moisture for a long time. Be sure to remove any gold items before getting in the pool, as the chlorine can dull the metal. [9] X Research source Take your gold off before getting in the shower, as well."

      "title": "Avoid wearing gold during strenuous activity.",
      "content": "Avoid wearing gold during strenuous activity. Do not wear gold jewelry when you will be taking part in an activity that causes you to sweat. Sweat is acidic, and it can damage gold. If taking off the gold during activity isn't possible, make sure to wipe it off as soon as possible with a soft cloth. [10] X Research source"

      "title": "Don't use lotion while wearing gold.",
      "content": "Don't use lotion while wearing gold. Certain cosmetic items can cause damage to gold, like lotion. Other items that could cause damage are hairspray and perfume. You can use these items while wearing gold, but make sure that the two materials don't make contact. [11] X Research source Don’t stress if you accidentally put on lotion while wearing gold; it’s easy to clean. Young says, “If you think about what's getting stuck in jewelry, it's typically hand lotion and oils that come off the skin. One of the best things to clean [jewelry with] is dish soap. So I would use a bowl of warm water, just a drop of dish soap, and a small toothbrush like a child's toothbrush [to remove the oils].”"

      "title": "Be careful not to bump your gold into things.",
      "content": "Be careful not to bump your gold into things. You don't have to stay still at all times when wearing gold, but it helps to be mindful of what you're doing. Try to avoid bumping into things and hitting the gold up against other objects. Being careful will prevent scratches and damage to the surface fo the gold. [12] X Research source Rubbing up against other pieces of jewelry can also scratch gold, so store each piece separately if possible."

      "title": "Wear delicate gold less often.",
      "content": "Wear delicate gold less often. It is tempting to show off your beautiful gold as much as possible, but try to limit its use. Wearing gold frequently increases your chances of scratching or tarnishing it. Instead save expensive or delicate gold for special occasions to help extend the piece’s lifespan.

      "title": "Can I use baking soda to clean gold jewelry?",
      "content": "Can I use baking soda to clean gold jewelry? Baking soda is abrasive, so it could scratch the gold if you attempt to polish or clean with it. Most jewelers advise against polishing with baking soda. Instead, opt for a mild dish soap and warm water solution. [14] X Research source"

      "content": "Is it safe to clean and polish gold with vinegar? Vinegar is acidic, so it can tarnish gold , especially if the piece is alloyed with other metals. Instead of polishing or cleaning gold with vinegar, use mild dish soap and water instead. [15] X Research source"

      "title": "How can I clean gold with gemstones?",
      "content": "How can I clean gold with gemstones? If you’re not sure how to properly care for the gemstones, talk to a jeweler before attempting to clean and polish the gold on your own. In general, though, make a solution of mild dish soap and water and use a soft brush to clean the gold around the gemstones, being careful not to dislodge them. Do not soak the gold in the solution. [16] X Research source It’s generally okay to clean gold with diamonds the same way you would plain gold. Young says, “Diamond jewelry is going to be set in gold or platinum. So the bowl of warm water, a drop of dish soap, and a child's toothbrush is going to be your best bet there.”"

      "title": "Can I use toothpaste to polish gold?",
      "content": "Can I use toothpaste to polish gold? Toothpaste often contains baking soda or other abrasive ingredients; it isn’t a good option for polishing gold, as it may leave micro scratches. As mentioned above, clean and polish the gold with a mixture of mild dish soap and water instead. [17] X Research source"

If your gold still lacks luster or isn’t as shiny as you want, it may be time to have it professionally cleaned and polished by a jeweler. Jewelers have the tools and expertise to buff out scratches and restore shine without damaging the gold. [18] X Research source"
