      "title": "Shadow Blade is a 2nd-level illusion spell in D&D 5e.",
      "content": "Shadow Blade is a 2nd-level illusion spell in D&D 5e. Many player characters (PCs) in D&D use physical weapons to deal damage, but illusory weapons are also an option with spells like Shadow Blade. When cast, it can create a magical sword made of solidified shadows—and even though Shadow Blade is technically an illusion spell, the damage it deals is very real. [1] X Research source Casting time : 1 bonus action Range : Self Components : Verbal and somatic Duration : Up to 1 minute (Concentration) Available to : Sorcerers, warlocks, and wizards Shadow Blade deals psychic damage—a damage type that functions the same as all the others. It may not leave a physical mark (depending on the DM's interpretation of its effects), but it hurts foes just like fire or slashing damage would."

      "title": "Shadow Blade creates a sword that deals psychic damage when used.",
      "content": "Shadow Blade creates a sword that deals psychic damage when used. This blade lasts until the spell ends and functions as a simple melee weapon, inflicting 2d8 psychic damage per hit. It also has the finesse, light, and thrown properties—and, most importantly, its wielder has advantage on attacks made against targets in dim light or darkness. [2] X Research source The Shadow Blade’s thrown property means you can throw it at foes; its range is 20/60 (meaning it can be thrown anywhere from 20 to 60 feet normally or a greater or lesser range at disadvantage). Dropping or throwing the blade causes it to disappear at the end of the turn. However, as long as the spell is active, you can re-summon it with a bonus action. The finesse property means you can use Strength or Dexterity for attacks (your choice), while the light property means you can dual-wield the weapon."

      "title": "Shadow Blade’s damage output increases every other spell level.",
      "content": "Shadow Blade’s damage output increases every other spell level. Although it’s a 2nd-level spell, you can upcast Shadow Blade at higher levels, too. Casting it at the 3rd or 4th level increases the damage to 3d8, casting it at the 5th or 6th level increases the damage to 4d8, and casting it at the 7th level or higher increases the damage to 5d8. [3] X Research source Regardless of the level you cast it at, the spell will always last for a maximum of 1 minute (unless you end it early or something interrupts your PC’s concentration)."

    {
      "title": "Cast the spell as a bonus action before attacking.",
      "content": "Cast the spell as a bonus action before attacking. Because it takes a bonus action to cast, you can use Shadow Blade and attack using an action in the same turn as long as you cast Shadow Blade first. From there, you can use it as a melee weapon—or, if you have multiple attacks per action, you can attack a nearby foe, then throw the blade at another and recall it on your next turn. [4] X Research source Try upcasting the spell at a higher level during battles with more difficult enemies to deal higher amounts of damage per attack. Remember: if your PC primarily uses weapons (not spells), carrying physical weapons as backup is still a good idea, even if you plan to use Shadow Blade. Although Shadow Blade is a spell, it doesn't count as a spell attack. After casting it, you'll still have to treat any attacks you make as melee (or ranged) weapon attacks rather than spells."

      "title": "Have an ally cast Darkness so you can attack with advantage.",
      "content": "Have an ally cast Darkness so you can attack with advantage. If you aren’t in dim light or darkness, you can create it using the Darkness spell (but your PC can’t cast it since it’s a concentration spell like Shadow Blade). So, if your PC can see in magical darkness, ask an ally to do the casting—then attack foes with advantage while they have disadvantage from the Darkness spell. [5] X Research source However, if you don’t have advantage from low light and don’t have Darkness available, you could also try summoning your familiar and having it give you the Help action on attacks. The Help action can also grant advantage, so you don’t necessarily need to be in darkness! Keep in mind you can cast this spell in any type of light. It'll still summon a shadow blade in broad daylight, for example; you just won't be able to get advantage automatically."

      "title": "Summon the Shadow Blade when physical weapons aren’t available.",
      "content": "Summon the Shadow Blade when physical weapons aren’t available. Are you sneaking into a restricted area where weapons aren’t allowed? Do you need to take down a target silently without leaving any evidence behind? Or have you simply been disarmed and need a quick second option? Look for opportunities to use the Shadow Blade in situations where it may be more helpful than a mundane weapon."

    {
      "title": "Warlock (Hexblade)",
      "content": "Warlock (Hexblade) While the spell is available to all warlocks, wizards, and sorcerers, there are specific subclasses and builds that may find it more useful than others—like the Hexblade warlock. As a Hexblade, your PC can use their Charisma on attack and damage rolls with this spell (which is a huge advantage, eliminating the need for Strength or Dexterity). [6] X Research source Try using your Hexblade’s Curse with Shadow Blade, too; this can increase your damage and chances of landing a critical hit. Then, take the Pact of the Blade and Lifedrinker invocation to deal extra necrotic damage using the Shadow Blade."

    {
      "title": "Wizard (Bladesinger)",
      "content": "Wizard (Bladesinger) Bladesingers are wizards with a talent for swordplay—making Shadow Blade uniquely useful for that subclass (whereas most other wizards probably won’t want any kind of melee weapon, even a magical one). As a Bladesinger, you’ll get special attack bonuses and an extra attack as you gain levels, so you can take multiple strikes with the blade. [7] X Research source Try using spells like Booming Blade or Green Flame Blade along with Shadow Blade to add even more damage to each hit."
    },
    {
      "title": "Sorcerer (Shadow Magic)",
      "content": "Sorcerer (Shadow Magic) Like wizards, most sorcerers probably won’t get much use out of a spell that creates melee weapons—but Shadow Magic sorcerers might. Not only is the spell thematically appropriate, but this subclass has a Strength of the Grave feature that lets them deflect potentially deadly hits (and thus maintain concentration on spells like Shadow Blade). [8] X Research source As a Shadow Magic sorcerer, try using sorcery points to create multiple Shadow Blades that you can wield simultaneously. You can also use a subclass feature to summon a Hound of Ill Omen (and have the hound give you advantage on attacks)."

      "title": "Rogue (Arcane Trickster)",
      "content": "Rogue (Arcane Trickster) While most rogues can’t cast Shadow Blade, Arcane Trickers have access to wizard spells—and Shadow Blade is right up their alley. Its thrown and finesse properties allow your Arcane Tricker to use the spell on ranged and melee attacks—and, specifically for Sneak Attacks, which is a key rogue feature. [9] X Research source Since Shadow Blade grants advantage in dim light and rogues can sneak anyway, it’s very easy for Arcane Trickers to get advantage with the spell. Plus, since few monsters are immune to psychic damage and mundane rogue weapons typically don’t do as much damage, Shadow Blade is incredibly strong for Arcane Tricksters."

    {
      "title": "Fighter (Eldritch Knight)",
      "content": "Fighter (Eldritch Knight) Like Arcane Tricksters, Eldritch Knight is the one fighter subclass with access to wizard spells, including Shadow Blade—and it’s a must-have. Eldritch Knight PCs can use the War Magic feature to attack with the Shadow Blade and use a cantrip like Booming Blade in the same turn (while using the Shadow Blade’s psychic damage to deal more powerful hits). [10] X Research source At higher levels, Eldritch Knights can also attack with a bonus action after casting a cantrip—meaning you can cast Booming Blade, attack, and then attack again as a bonus action."

      "title": "Choose feats and equipment that can empower your Shadow Blade.",
      "content": "Choose feats and equipment that can empower your Shadow Blade. Along with the class-specific features mentioned above, some optional feats available to most PCs can make your attacks (and ability to concentrate on the spell) more effective. Similarly, look out for useful magic items that can help you cast Shadow Blade more often (or increase your attack damage). For example: [11] X Research source Elven Accuracy . This feat can help elves using the Shadow Blade gain advantage on attacks, even when not in dim light or darkness. Mobile . This feat grants the ability to move faster and avoid opportunity attacks, which can be helpful while maneuvering through combat with your Shadow Blade. War Caster . This feat grants advantage on concentration checks, making it easier to maintain your Shadow Blade in a fight. Cloak of Displacement . This magic item imposes disadvantage on enemies trying to attack you (while you’ll still have advantage on them with the Shadow Blade). Flame Tongue . This magic weapon can deal fire damage, which is helpful if an enemy is resistant to psychic damage. Pearl of Power . With this magic item, you can recover expended spell slots, allowing you to cast Shadow Blade more daily."

      "title": "Shadow Blade is situationally useful for certain character builds.",
      "content": "Shadow Blade is situationally useful for certain character builds. Just because it’s available to all sorcerers, wizards, and warlocks doesn’t mean all spellcaster PCs will find it worth using. It’s mainly useful for specific builds—ones capable of fighting in melee combat (rather than casting spells from range). It’s not a good spell for every PC, but it can be very good for some of them! That’s why Shadow Blade is actually best for Hexblade warlocks, Bladesinger wizards, and more combat-oriented classes like Eldritch Knight fighters and Arcane Trickster rogues. You might also use it if you multiclass with a more combat-oriented class (like a sorcerer or warlock and paladin)."
