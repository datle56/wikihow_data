For this project, you’ll need paint and primer (if you’re not using a pre-primed, metal-clad door). Some products nowadays contain both paint and primer in one.

      "content": "Remove the door from the hinges. Insert a flathead screwdriver between the hinge and the hinge pin. Angle the screwdriver upward at a 45-degree angle, and tap the end of the screwdriver with a hammer. As you tap, the hinge pin will come out of the hinge. Pull the hinge pin out from the hinge. Repeat with the other hinge. Loosen both the hinges and remove the door. Have somebody else hold the door as you remove it from the hinges. When you have the door off, lay it horizontally on a bench or across two sawhorses. It’s also OK to paint or stain the door while it’s still hanging. In that case, you’ll need to mask off the hardware or cover it with a painter’s rag."

      "content": "Fill in holes. If there are any holes in the door, such as nail marks, fill these in with small amounts of Bondo or wood filler. Go over the door and locate holes and cracks. When you find one, inject some filler into the hole to fill it. Smooth down the filler and press it into the hole or crack with a putty knife or scraper. When you’ve filled all the holes, set the door aside to let the filler dry. Read the manufacturer’s directions for exact times."

      "content": "Clean metal doors. To give yourself the cleanest surface possible, clean the surface of a metal door with a mild solvent like mineral spirits to remove dirt, grime, and old paint residue. Soak a rag in mineral spirits or another solvent and rub the surface of the door. This step is not necessary if you're painting a wooden door."

    {
      "title": "Sand the door.",
      "content": "Sand the door. To give the new paint a good surface to adhere to, it’s important to rough up the surface of the door with sandpaper. This will also help remove any dirt and residue from the surface. Go over the entire surface of the door with 220-grit sandpaper, making sure to get all corners, nooks, and crannies. If you're painting a metal door, sand before cleaning it."

      "content": "Vacuum and wipe down the door. Before you can paint the door, you must clean it to remove dust and dirt. Use a small brush attachment and vacuum the door, including all the recesses and corners. Take a slightly damp cloth and wipe down the entire surface of the door to get rid of any dust that the vacuum missed. Set the door aside and allow it to air dry for about an hour. If you cleaned a metal door with solvent, wash it with water mixed with a few drops of dish soap. Rinse the door and allow it to dry before proceeding."

      "content": "Tape and paper hardware and windows. You need to protect features that cannot be removed, such as windows. Cover the window or element with newspaper, and then tape the paper in place with painter’s tape. Make sure the tape or paper covers every surface that you don’t want to be painted. If you left the door on its hinges, tape adjacent walls, the frame, and the hinges. You can use a drop cloth, too, if you have one handy."

      "title": "Choose a paint.",
      "content": "Choose a paint. You need special paints for exterior surfaces, because outside doors will be exposed to many more elements than interior ones. [4] X Expert Source Patrick Coye Painting Specialist Expert Interview. 19 August 2020. Your best bet for paint is either a water-based acrylic or latex paint or an alkyd-based oil paint. Water-based paints tend to dry faster than oil paints, but oil paints will provide better protection for the surface underneath. If you currently have water-based paint on your door, you'll have to paint over it with the same type of paint. The same goes for oil-based paints – you’ll need to cover it with another oil-based paint. Make sure the paint you choose is specifically formulated for exterior surfaces. Exterior paint has antimicrobials that prevent the growth of mildew, mold, and algae, besides also holding up better to UV rays.

      "title": "Pick a primer.",
      "content": "Pick a primer. Before you paint the door, you'll have to apply a layer of primer that will help the paint get better coverage and adhere to the surface more easily. You can use an oil-based primer with oil- and water-based paints. The best is to apply an oil-based primer followed by a latex paint. For primer color, choose a neutral color or a lighter version of the color you're painting the door."

      "title": "Choose the right day to paint.",
      "content": "Choose the right day to paint. The ideal day for painting will be above 50 F (10 C). Also, if you're painting outside, choose a day when there's no direct sunlight hitting the door. However, make sure it’s not raining either, and that it’s not too humid or too windy. If it’s too cold when you paint, the paint won’t dry. Wind and sun can cause the paint to dry too quickly, and humidity can prevent it from drying properly."

Then use the roller to paint the panel. Repeat until all the recessed panels have been painted. Use the roller to paint the rest of the door, including the top, sides, and bottom. [6] X Research source If your door is one flat piece of wood or metal, use the roller to paint the entire door. When the primer has had enough time to dry (usually a couple of hours), flip the door over and paint the other side."

Drop the hinge pin into place, and tap it down with a hammer or the handle of a screwdriver to secure it in place. You may find it easier to have someone else help you with this. One person can hold the door in place and the other can put in the hinge pins."
