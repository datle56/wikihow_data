      "content": "Determine what kinds of pictures you want to include. Common pictures include album artwork, shots of the band playing music, hanging out, and at live shows, and images that relate to the words currently being sung. You can even choose to put lyrics up as they're sung in certain moments. There is no wrong series of pictures to put up, but you should think about what the song says to you and how you want to portray it. The most popular videos have photos that fit seamlessly with the music being played. Think of a theme or story in advance that you want to tell. You can use pictures from your own life or those found online. Know, however, that it is illegal to profit off of someone else's work, so you cannot charge people for the music video unless the pictures and song are all your own. [1] X Research source You can choose different images that tell a story and have a beginning, middle, and end and map out those pictures in a stop motion concept."

      "content": "Click and drag all of your photos onto the timeline next to the song. This process is slightly different for each program, but you should end up with each photo end to end on your editing timeline. The first shot should be lined up with the start of the song. Usually you can click and drag the files right from your folder into the editing program. If this doesn't work, try \"File\" â†’ \"Import,\" then find the photos. Click and drag them after importing into the video workstation."

      "title": "Divide the number of seconds in the song by the number of photos you have to determine how long each shot should be.",
      "content": "Divide the number of seconds in the song by the number of photos you have to determine how long each shot should be. To determine the number of seconds, simply multiply 60 by the number of minutes in the song, then add the leftover seconds. Therefore, a 2:40 long song would be 160 seconds long (60x2=120, + 40 = 160 ). Divide this number by your photos to determine the total length of each shot. For example, if you had 80 photos for a 160-second song, you'd need each photo to last for two seconds to fit the whole video. If you want some photos to go longer than others, you can simply use this as a guideline. Simply start with the appropriate number of seconds per photo, then adjust individual photos by hand."

It may not be labeled \"Set Length of Clips,\" but it will be similar. Some other possibilities are: \"Duration,\" \"Clip Length,\" or \"Clip Timing.\" Some programs, like iMovie, let you change the duration of all stills, by default, in \"Preferences.\" Simply set \"Duration of Stills\" to your desired length."
