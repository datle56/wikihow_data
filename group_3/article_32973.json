      "content": "Know the magic cards. They are as follows: 2s make that suit the trump suit for the trick 7s automatically win the round, but if more than one player plays a 7, the last one played wins Jacks are not suit-sensitive, so if the Jack is the highest card played, even if it's not following suit or a trump, it wins. If more than one Jack is played and they are the highest cards, the trump or one following suit wins, or failing that, the one with the highest suit (S, H, D, C)."

After all the cards are played, the round is ended and any player who hasn't won at least one trick becomes a bitch and if they have a partner they also become a bitch. Bitches only get given one card, but they can play it in any trick they like. If you don't win the trick, or, if you're in a pair and neither of you win a trick, you are eliminated. If you do or your partner does, you are back as a regular player in the game."

If one of you has not won any tricks in the last round and you split then, only the one who didn't win any tricks will become a bitch. However, if you have become bitches and neither of you have won a trick in the next round, it's too late and you are both eliminated."
