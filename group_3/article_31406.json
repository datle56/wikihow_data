      "title": "Spray your sneakers with a leather protector before wearing them.",
      "content": "Spray your sneakers with a leather protector before wearing them. Leather protector spray repels water from your shoes, which prevents them from cracking or creasing. Use at least 2 coats to cover your entire sneaker, and let them dry before stepping outside. [1] X Research source This also protects your sneakers from stains. Follow the instructions of your leather protector to see how often to reapply it."

      "title": "Place crease protectors inside the toe box.",
      "content": "Place crease protectors inside the toe box. Since there’s a small space between your foot and the top of the shoe, creasing is especially common around the toe box. A crease protector is a foam or plastic insert that fills the gap in this area, preventing wrinkles when you walk. You can barely feel them, and they also preserve the overall shape of your sneaker.

      "title": "Wear your sneakers with thick socks.",
      "content": "Wear your sneakers with thick socks. If there’s any gap between your foot and the shoe, the leather can bend when you walk. Fill up any remaining room in your sneaker by wearing thicker socks than usual. [3] X Research source You can also double layer regular socks if you don’t have thick socks."

      "title": "Use a shoe horn to put on your sneakers.",
      "content": "Use a shoe horn to put on your sneakers. A shoe horn is a long, flat tool that helps slip your heel into your shoe smoothly. It prevents your foot from jamming into the back of your sneaker, minimizing creasing and structural damage. [4] X Research source If you don’t have a shoe horn, use a credit card to help ease the heel of your shoe over your foot."

    {
      "title": "Walk heel-to-toe to avoid creasing the toe box.",
      "content": "Walk heel-to-toe to avoid creasing the toe box. If you apply pressure to your toes when you take a step, creases are more likely to appear. Shift your weight towards your heel to keep your sneakers looking as new as possible. [5] X Research source Avoid walking on your tiptoes and kneeling in your sneakers. This bends the leather in the toe box, which can cause creases. To walk without creasing your shoes , lift your chest, keep your shoulders back, and maintain a straight back. Proper posture makes it easier to walk flat footed."

      "title": "Avoid tying your shoelaces too tight.",
      "content": "Avoid tying your shoelaces too tight. If you tie leather sneakers like normal running shoes, the material bunches up and creases. [6] X Research source Let your shoes breathe by using the loose lacing method: [7] X Research source Thread the lace through the back of the metal AF1 tag, and thread each end of the lace through the bottom eyelets (to create a horizontal bar). Make sure the AF1 tag is centered and the ends of the lace are even in length. In a diagonal direction, insert the right end of the lace into the next hole on the left side, and then insert the left end of the lace into the next hole of the right side. Make sure the laces are flat, and continue this pattern until you reach the top of the shoe. When you reach the last holes at the top of the shoe, thread the laces under each other, and then work your way down the laces to loosen them (until there’s only an inch of lace remaining at each end). You can either leave the ends of the lace hanging (without tying them) or tuck them into the tongue of your shoe."

      "content": "Avoid wearing your sneakers every day. Leather wears naturally over time, and this can cause creases to appear. If you still want to wear your Air Forces daily, consider buying 2 pairs that you can alternate between. [8] X Research source Wear your first pair of sneakers 2-3 days in a row, and then switch to your other pair. This allows them to fully dry out, which minimizes creasing. [9] X Research source"

      "content": "Avoid working out in your sneakers. Even though Air Force 1s are comfortable, they’re designed for style rather than impact. Exercising in your Forces can cause major creasing and wear, so stick with an athletic shoe (or buy another pair to wear solely at the gym). [10] X Research source"

      "content": "Purchase the right sneaker size. If there’s extra room at the front of your shoe, the leather can bunch up and crease. Look for a pair that fits your heel and toe area snugly, without feeling too tight. [12] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Medical School Harvard Medical School's Educational Site for the Public Go to source Before buying your shoes, walk around in them to make sure they don’t slide around. If you’re in between sizes, choose the smaller size. The leather will stretch over time and mold to your feet, giving you the perfect fit. [13] X Research source"

      "content": "Stuff the sneaker with cloth so it retains its shape. Roll up the cloth so it’s compressed tightly before packing your entire shoe. Focus on filling any space in the toe box to help smooth out creases, and leave the shoelaces tied to help maintain the structure of the shoe as you remove creases. [14] X Research source You can use a small cloth, an old shirt, or socks to pack your sneakers. Avoid using newspaper to fill your shoe—it can burst into flames if you accidentally leave your iron in one place for too long. [15] X Research source"

      "content": "Dampen a cotton towel lightly in water and place it over the crease. Dip a small hand towel or washcloth in a bowl of water, and ring out any excess moisture so it’s not dripping. [16] X Research source Use a white towel to avoid any dye from bleeding onto your shoe when you iron it. The towel acts as a barrier between the shoe and your iron so you don’t create burn marks and damage your sneakers permanently."

[17] X Research source While you’re waiting for the iron to heat up, be sure to set it upright to avoid burning anything in your home. The damp cloth transfers the heat from the iron to your sneaker, which can help remove creases in your sneaker. [18] X Research source"

To prevent the shoe from overheating, iron for 10 seconds increments and let the spot cool down, and move the towel to a damp spot if it becomes dry (before ironing again). [19] X Research source If your iron has a steaming function, use it while you’re ironing to add moisture to the towel (and help soften the leather to get rid of creases). [20] X Research source Avoid ironing too close to the sole of your sneaker—it’s made out of a synthetic material that isn’t heat friendly. [21] X Research source"

      "content": "Remove the towel from the sneaker after it cools down. Once you’re done ironing, let the towel rest on the shoe until it’s cool to the touch—the remaining heat from the towel can create a steaming effect to remove any creases you may have missed. Then, leave the shoe stuffed overnight to help reshape it. [22] X Research source Repeat the ironing process as many times as you like until you’re happy with your sneakers. If you have badly creased sneakers, small marks might remain after ironing but you can still bring the shoe back to its original shape. [23] X Research source"

Moisture can cause the leather to crease, so keep your Air Forces as dry as possible.

When you’re not wearing your Air Forces, keep shoe trees inside of them to fill up any space (and help minimize creases). [25] X Research source Wooden shoe trees absorb moisture in your sneakers, which can help them last longer. You can also stuff your sneakers with crumpled newspaper or socks to help keep their shape."

[26] X Research source Pour a few drops of leather conditioner onto a microfiber towel , and then gently rub the product into your shoe, concentrating on any creases. This keeps your Air Forces soft and shiny—just like the day you purchased them! [27] X Research source During the winter months, you may want to condition your sneakers more often. Just keep an eye on them to see if they’re becoming dry or brittle."
