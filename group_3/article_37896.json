      "content": "Check local laws to learn if you can hold a raffle and what permits you need. Visit the websites of your local government regulatory agencies or call their offices to make sure your organization can legally hold a raffle. Your state may prohibit raffles. Other states place regulations on how many raffles non-profit organizations can conduct per year and what prizes are allowed. In many states, non-profits must apply for a permit or raffle license to conduct their raffle since it’s technically considered a type of gambling.

      "content": "Decide when and where to hold your raffle. Most raffle drawings are held in person during events. That way, you can sell raffle tickets to attendees and build excitement as everyone awaits the drawing and announcement of the winner. If you’re holding an online raffle, you still have to choose a deadline for buying tickets and a time to hold the drawing. [2] X Research source Build hype around the raffle by posting about the potential prizes on social media and including instructions on when and where tickets will be sold."

      "content": "Buy and solicit prizes from local businesses. All raffles promise at least one lucky winner a prize after the drawing. You can get local businesses to donate prizes as a tax write-off. [3] X Research source There may be more than one raffle contest prize, or even prize levels (first, second, third, etc.) based on the order of the draw. Gift certificates at popular stores make great prizes. That way, you're giving out a prize, but in reality, the winner is picking out their own prize at the store. Avoid prizes that are tightly regulated, such as alcohol, tobacco, and firearms. Pay attention to the laws around reporting raffle winnings to the IRS. Prizes valued at $600 or more or 300 times the amount of the wager (ticket cost) must be reported to the IRS using Form W-2G. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Print or order raffle tickets. You can use your favorite word processor to print DIY raffle tickets. On one side of the ticket (the stub side), list the organization name, address, and phone number. Include the raffle event name and drawing date. On the opposite side of the ticket, provide spaces for participants to fill in their information: participant name, address, phone number, and email address. [5] X Research source You can also simply order raffle tickets online. Get a double roll so ticket purchasers can keep one ticket, and you can place the other with their information into the random drawing. If you’re holding an online raffle drawing without tickets, use a platform like Zeffy or RallyUp. Tickets may or may not have numbers on them. Some state regulations require numbers, so look into the rules for your particular state before having tickets printed."

      "title": "Price your raffle tickets appropriately.",
      "content": "Price your raffle tickets appropriately. Consider the value of the raffle prizes, how much money you hope to raise, and the wealth of your potential ticket buyers when pricing your tickets. It’s common to price tickets for a raffle targeted at the general public at $2 per ticket or $5 for 3 tickets. [6] X Research source If you’re a nonprofit running a raffle as a fundraiser, set a goal for the amount you want to raise by deciding what impact you want to have. For example, if it costs $100 to help one person, you might set a goal of $10,000 to help 100 people, explains digital fundraising and crowdfunding expert Rob Wu. Once you have a goal, you can create a story that will encourage people to buy tickets as a way to donate to your charitable cause."

      "content": "Sell tickets for your raffle. Have each purchaser fill in their contact information, either on the ticket itself or on a form, along with their ticket number. Place the ticket they purchase into a box or other container from which the winning ticket will be drawn. There are many ways to sell your raffle contest tickets: Door to door. Knock on doors and invite people to participate. Online. Promoting the raffle online is a good way to reach a broad audience that doesn't require a lot of footwork, but you need to check state regulations to make sure Internet raffle contest marketing fits inside governing policy. Storefronts. Local shops and boutiques, especially those donating prizes, may be willing to let you post flyers in their windows or on their doors advertising the raffle. Print ads. Inexpensive ads in local newspapers and lifestyle magazines are an effective way to get the community involved. Booths. Booths outside of local stores or at art shows, carnivals, and festivals are a good way to draw raffle participants. Fundraising event. Sell tickets for the raffle contest at the actual event where the raffle drawing is to occur."

First, thank everyone who donated prizes, bought tickets, or sponsored the event. [7] X Research source Then, have a designated person draw from the pool of raffle tickets without looking. Announce either the winner's name or the winning ticket number. Keep the box with the tickets in it at a secure location to avoid cheating. Believe it or not, sometimes people try to cheat at nonprofit raffles by adding fake tickets. Mix the tickets up so that the drawing isn't biased in favor of tickets that were placed in the box earlier or later. Shake it up."

      "content": "Contact any winners who were not there to claim their raffle contest prizes. Use the contact information that they filled out on the raffle ticket to reach out to them. Typically, you'll need to exercise due diligence by contacting the winner by phone and certified letter, and let them know in your communications how long they have to claim the prize. Inform the winners if they have to report their winnings to the IRS and how to do so. [8] X Research source Check local and state/provincial laws for information on how to contact winners and how much time you should give them to claim their prize. Make this time limit clear when you contact the winner. In some cases, winners might be required to be there in person. If that's the case, make sure it's spelled out in the rules for entering the raffle."

      "content": "50/50 Raffle In a 50/50 raffle, instead of offering a prize, the money raised from ticket sales is the prize. Whoever holds the winning ticket when it’s drawn splits the ticket sales earnings in half with the nonprofit. This kind of raffle is ideal if you plan to sell many tickets. People may not mind buying raffle tickets at a higher price, either. [9] X Research source Check your state’s rules and regulations to see if you can hold this type of raffle. Remember that prizes over $600 or 300 times the amount of the wager (ticket cost) must be reported to the IRS, and you must withhold 25% of winnings over $5,000 in value. [10] X Research source"

      "content": "Reverse Raffle In a reverse raffle, a limited number of tickets are sold for a high price, such as $100 each. The nonprofit keeps two-thirds of the funds, while the winner of the raffle gets the remaining one-third. When it’s time for the drawing, every ticket is drawn except one. The one that wasn’t drawn is the winner—hence why it’s called a reverse raffle. [11] X Research source The drawing is suspenseful and fun for entrants, but you have to limit the number of tickets you sell so it doesn’t go on forever."

They can “bid” on prizes by placing their raffle tickets in the jars in front of each item. They might place tickets in multiple jars or place all their tickets in one jar to boost their odds. At the end of the night, an organizer randomly draws a winning ticket from each bowl. [12] X Research source This type of raffle was formerly known as a Chinese auction. This term is now recognized as derogatory. Alternative names like tricky tray raffle, penny social, or chance auction are now used instead. [13] X Research source"
