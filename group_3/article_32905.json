If you’re planning to plant it outdoors, choose an area with well-drained soil and plenty of space around it. Keep the plant 15-25 ft (4.5-7.5 m) away from your home and any other structures, trees, or electrical lines. Make sure that the spot you choose is also in at least partial shade or full sun if you don’t live in a warm area with a long growing season. [3] X Trustworthy Source EDIS Electronic database of the University of Florida Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences's peer-reviewed articles Go to source For your best growing and harvesting results, ensure that at least the leaves of the plant are exposed to full sun as it matures. The roots can be in the shade, if necessary, but the leaves must be in the sun in order for the fruit to bloom. It’s also important that your dragon fruit cactus stays mostly dry, so avoid any areas of your garden where water tends to pool. If you live in an area with a lot of rainfall, place the plant on a hill or mound so that any excess water can drain away."

Create a hole that’s 3 to 4 times larger in diameter than your nursery container. Then, dig to make the hole 3 times as deep as the nursery container. While this hole may seem large at first, the process of digging it will loosen up your soil and help the dragon fruit plant to develop a root system. [4] X Research source"

Gently remove the plant from its original container (being careful not to damage the roots) and plant it into the ground. The plant should be submerged in the soil at the same depth as it was in its original pot or box. [5] X Trustworthy Source EDIS Electronic database of the University of Florida Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences's peer-reviewed articles Go to source In terms of the type of soil you should use to refill the hole, stick to a well-draining and moist soil that’s rich in organic matter. If desired, you can use a sandy cactus soil to help the plant stay dry (it is a cactus, after all!). If you live in a drier area, you may want to place mulch around the base of your plant to help the soil retain its moisture. If you’re planting multiple dragon fruit cacti, space your plants at least 6 ft (1.8 m) apart."

If you’re planting in a container, choose one that’s 15–24 inches (380–610 mm) in diameter and at least 10 inches (250 mm) deep. Make sure that the pot has plenty of drainage holes at the bottom. Place a layer of pebbles or bark at the bottom of the container, then fill it about ¾ full with a well-draining and nutrient-rich potting soil . Carefully remove your plant from its original container and place it into the pot, then secure it with a few more scoops of potting soil. [6] X Research source Fit the pot with a sturdy trellis or climbing pole , and be prepared to transplant it as it grows and requires a bigger pot. To prevent any chance of your pot toppling over, opt for a ceramic or terra-cotta pot (rather than a lightweight plastic one). While you may technically be able to grow any type of dragon fruit in an indoor pot, it’s best to choose a smaller variety of the plant—like Edgar’s Baby, Alice, Seoul Kitchen, Yellow Dragon Fruit, or Zamorano."

Avoid overwatering your dragon fruit, as excessive watering may lead to root rot and forms of fungal disease that put your plant at risk. [8] X Research source If your plant is large enough by now to have a climbing pole, keep the climbing pole moist as well. If you're using a pot, keep in mind how it drains.

If you live in an area where the outside temperatures frequently reach 100 °F (38 °C), consider planting your tropical cactus in partial shade. However, avoid placing your dragon fruit plant in an area with too much shade, as that may negatively impact your fruit production and harvest quality. [10] X Research source On the other end of the spectrum, dragon fruit plants won’t survive in freezing weather or even a frost (especially if that cold weather is prolonged).

Dragon fruit plants are actually nocturnal, so their flowers open at night to be pollinated by bats and moths. Some flowers may stay open in the early morning and be pollinated by bees, but this is less common. [11] X Trustworthy Source University of California Division of Agriculture and Natural Resources Extension program of the University of California system devoted to educating and improving local communities Go to source If you’re growing two varieties of dragon fruit that are not self-pollinating and want your flowers to be cross-pollinated, you’ll have to do hard-pollinating yourself between dusk and dawn.

Once your plant becomes established and fully matured, its tops can become quite congested and prohibit the development of new growth. Cut back any overly long or tangled stems, as well as any that are damaged or dead. You will likely have to do this two or three times a year, although younger or smaller plants may only need to be pruned once per year. [12] X Research source If new growth isn’t possible, it will be difficult for flowers and fruits to form. Failing to prune the cactus may also lead to fungal disease or insect infestation."

Look at the small “wings” on the outside of the fruit—if they look like they’re just beginning to wither, that’s a good sign that the fruit is ripe and ready to be picked. As a final test, grasp and lightly squeeze the fruit in your hand. If it’s ripe, you’ll feel just a slight amount of give.

If your fruit is ripe, it should twist easily off of the stem without too much pulling or tugging. If you see any fruits that have fallen from the stem on their own, these fruits are likely overripe and unlikely to be tasty! [14] X Research source You can actually also harvest and eat the cactus’ large edible flowers. However, these blooms are nocturnal and can only be picked at night. Once in full production, you could see four to six fruit-bearing cycles per year. They amp up eventually; it just takes them a little while to get there. So don't think your first fruit will be your last. You've waited patiently, and now abundance is your reward!"

You don’t need to peel the dragon fruit , however, you can just cut it in half lengthwise to open it up. Then, scoop out the fruit and cut it into quarters for snacking—or just dig straight in with a spoon! [15] X Research source Try blending your dragon fruit into smoothies, chopping it up for a salsa, or just eating it as is (you can drizzle some honey on top for added sweetness).

This time period will allow for the wound to heal and prevent infection once it’s planted. For added protection, treat the cut end with a fungicide . [16] X Research source You can take cuttings from a dragon fruit plant at any time, but you’ll see faster growth if it’s done during the warm summer months.

Then, fill a pot with a well-draining potting mix and insert the cut stem into the soil (cut side down). Keep the pot in a bright, shady spot while the root complex develops. Once your plant has established roots, move it into the sun. [17] X Research source Keep your cutting moderately moist while you wait for it to root. Water your dragon fruit cactus whenever it seems dry. Keep the soil moderately moist, but avoid overwatering. It may take your cutting about 4-6 months to develop a solid root system. After this time, you can plant it outdoors or in a larger pot, then wait about 1-3 years to see a harvest."

Once you notice that your plant’s roots have grown too large for its container (you’ll usually see them poking out of the drainage holes at the bottom of the pot), it must be repotted. Carefully remove the plant from its current container and place it into a larger container with fresh potting soil, being cautious not to damage the small roots.
