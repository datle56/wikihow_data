If, however, you have a tighter-than-average foreskin, slide the foreskin back more slowly and deliberately to reduce pain and the chance of injury.

You could cause a painful tear in the sensitive skin. Move on to trying methods to loosen the foreskin. A tight foreskin is known as phimosis. It's common for a child's uncircumcised penis to have this condition, but it typically goes away during adolescence. It can be an issue for adults as well, though. You can stretch your foreskin up to twice a day. [3] X Expert Source Scott Tobis, MD Board Certified Urologist Expert Interview. 26 August 2021."

      "content": "Pull a tight foreskin back incrementally over days or weeks. If you cannot retract your foreskin fully without pain because it's too tight, try slowly stretching it out. On the first day, gently pull the foreskin back until you feel discomfort. The next day, gently pull it slightly further back, and keep doing so once or twice per day for up to several weeks.

      "content": "Try more intensive foreskin-stretching exercises if needed. If the incremental approach isn't helping enough, try a more dedicated stretching program. If the ring at the tip of your foreskin is tight, use your fingers to gently stretch it wider for 20-30 seconds at a time. If other areas of your foreskin are tight, you can similarly use your hands to gently stretch those areas. [7] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Do the exercises for 3-5 minutes, up to 3 times per day. It could take several weeks to a year or more to get noticeable results. You might also consider using a “flesh tunnel,” which is a silicone ring you place under the top ring of your foreskin for a few hours at a time each day. The device will help to incrementally stretch the foreskin. Stop the exercises if you experience pain, redness, or bleeding. Talk to your doctor for guidance."

Topical steroids help to stretch the foreskin. If you have an infection because of a tight foreskin, you might be prescribed an antifungal cream or antibiotics . In some cases, circumcision —the surgical removal of the foreskin—might be recommended as the best option. For adults, this is typically a quick procedure done under local anesthesia, with a healing time of 1 to 2 weeks."

      "title": "Do not force a child's foreskin to retract.",
      "content": "Do not force a child's foreskin to retract. At birth, and often for several years afterward, most or all of the foreskin usually remains attached to the head of the penis. The foreskin normally detaches from the penis tip (so that it can be retracted) by age 5, but it can take until puberty in some cases. Until that time, don't try to forcibly pull back a foreskin that is still attached. [9] X Research source Forcibly pulling back an attached foreskin will cause a great deal of pain and can lead to skin tears, bleeding, scarring, and possibly nerve damage."

Before puberty, you generally don't need to pull back the foreskin to clean beneath it, even if it has detached from the head of the penis.

If a child's foreskin is still connected to the penis head after puberty begins, or if they can't retract it because it's too tight (phimosis), make an appointment with their doctor.
