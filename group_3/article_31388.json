While you should not go to great lengths to change your appearance just to satisfy other people, you may want to consider taking some small steps to make yourself more attractive. [3] X Research source People tend to find under-eye bags creepy. If you have these, there are a variety of ways to minimize their appearance, including reducing your alcohol and sodium intake, treating your seasonal allergies, sleeping on your back, removing your makeup before bed, using sunscreen, quitting smoking, and applying a cool compress to your eyes. [4] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Opthamologists Professional medical organization focused on advocating for public health and supporting sight-related research Go to source Bulging eyes are also generally considered creepy. If you're a woman, try applying dark eye shadow to your lids and curling your eyelashes to help them appear less bulging. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Dress well. The way you dress is the aspect of your appearance that you have the most control over. Because people tend to associate anything out of the ordinary with creepiness, try to keep your clothing neutral and on-trend. [6] X Research source Steer clear of clothing that doesn't match or doesn't fit you well. It's also best to avoid anything that looks like it should be worn as part of a costume, like a cape. Don't wear clothing with slogans that promote violence or dehumanize women, as this may make people think you are potentially violent, and thus creepy. [7] X Research source There's nothing wrong with wearing clothes that express your personality, but if you're really concerned about other people thinking you're creepy, be careful about wearing anything too unique. If you're unsure whether an outfit will make you look creepy, try asking a trusted friend or relative what they think. You don't need to be extremely fashion-forward to not look creepy. A simple pair of jeans and a t-shirt is usually a safe choice."

      "content": "Avoid talking about things that others find disturbing. People typically find it creepy when others talk about morbid topics, especially for extended periods of time. It's best to avoid these topics altogether, unless you are sure that the person you are talking about will be interested. Some topics to avoid include death, torture, and sexual fetishes. [8] X Research source People tend to assume that individuals whose professions or hobbies involve death are creepy, so if you enjoy taxidermy or work as a mortician, you may want to avoid bringing these topics up with new acquaintances. If it comes up, you can laugh and acknowledge \"It's a little creepy!\", and then talk about a more cheerful topic. There are also some less obvious topics that many people find weird. The best example is clowns, which give lots of people the creeps. While talking about sex is not always creepy, talking about it constantly or at inappropriate times definitely is. If you're ever unsure whether it is appropriate, avoid bringing it up.

It's important to respect people's privacy, especially if you don't know them well. For example, asking someone how much money they make is typically considered rude. Asking a more obscure question, like what blood type the person is, is just plain creepy because you have no need to know that information. [10] X Research source Even if you know someone well, be careful about asking obtrusive or rude questions. If you ever want to ask something but you're not sure if it's appropriate, consider prefacing the question by saying something like, \"I'm sorry if this is a weird question\" or \"Forgive me for asking.\" You can also say afterwards, \"You don't have to answer that if it's too personal.\""

      "content": "Avoid making abrupt sexual advances. Most people do not appreciate uninvited sexual advances. To avoid being seen as a creep, it's best to avoid advancing on someone you've just met. If you are really interested in the person, try getting to know them first instead of just trying to pick them up. [11] X Trustworthy Source United Nations Official site for the United Nations, an intergovernmental organization devoted to maintaining peace and building relationships between all nations. Go to source Men are much more likely to be considered creepy when they make uninvited sexual advances on women than vice versa. In fact, women tend to think that \"creepy\" men pose some kind of sexual threat, and may be afraid of them. Compliments are okay, but try not to go overboard. If you have just met a person, try only offering one compliment instead of several. You can decrease your chances of the compliment being interpreted as creepy if you avoid staring at the person before offering it and if you try talking to the person and getting to know each other a bit first. Also, try to make compliments more general, such as, \"I like your shirt!\" or \"Hey, where'd you get that phone case? It's nice.\" Don't say stuff like, \"Your eyes are beautiful.\" or \"You smell good.\""

Don't catcall; this is creepy and misogynistic. [12] X Research source Don't assume that a friendly waiter or barista is flirting. Their job requires them to be polite, and they are \"trapped\" because they need to work and stay polite. [13] X Research source If you absolutely want to date them, leave your phone number with the check, so there is no pressure. Do not flirt with people who are much younger than you.

If they show signs of discomfort (closed-off body language, looking away, plastered-on smile, fake laugh, avoiding eye contact, frowning), then they are not interested. [14] X Research source Apologize for making them uncomfortable, and stop. Flirting with someone who clearly doesn't like it is one of the fastest ways to be seen as creepy. Some people are shy. If they are smiling, then gently proceed. If they look upset, stop right away. Start small. Talk to them, flirt, and see how they respond. Then amp it up if you are getting a positive response. Sending an unsolicited photo of your genitals to a stranger is the exact opposite of what you want to do. Some dating guides tell people (usually men flirting with women) to push the other person's boundaries. This is bad advice, and may scare them and get you pepper sprayed. Always respect someone else's comfort level. [15] X Research source"

This is a mark of good manners and shows that you are non-threatening. Non-creepy people know how to take \"no\" for an answer. If someone looks like they want to leave a conversation, give them an opportunity to do so. Trying to make them stay can make you seem creepy. [16] X Research source Some people, especially women, disabled people, and abuse survivors, may be afraid to express boundaries. Pay attention to their body language.

Avoid sudden outbursts, especially if they could be interpreted as violent. If you feel an outburst coming on, say \"I need some air\" and leave to cool off. Always try to gauge the appropriateness of your behavior by assessing the atmosphere and watching how others are behaving. For example, if you are giving a formal presentation, you would be expected to stand up straight and look at the crowd, so people might find it creepy if you were sitting down and looking at the floor.

There are many others as well, so always take a moment to think about how other people might perceive you before you make any gesture.
