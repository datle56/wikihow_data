      "content": "Unwrap the Kisses and place them in a heat-safe bowl. Hershey Kisses come wrapped individually in thin foil. The standard milk chocolate versions, which are the best for melting, are wrapped in plain silver foil. Unwrap each one and place them into a heat-safe bowl (like glass). If you aren't sure, check your bowl for a \"heat-safe\" label. [1] X Research source A standard 12 ounce bag of Kisses contains 72 individually wrapped candies. Melting the whole bag will result in about 1.5 cups (350 ml) of melted chocolate. A wide, shallow bowl is often recommended for melting chocolate. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Set your microwave to 50% power. Since individual microwaves vary so much in power, it’s best to be on the side of caution and set it to 50% to avoid burning the Kisses. The process for changing the power varies from microwave to microwave, but you can usually adjust it after you hit the “Cook Time” or “Power Level” button on the front of the machine. [3] X Research source Consult your microwave’s instruction manual for more specific instructions."

Remove the bowl carefully from the microwave. [4] X Research source If you're melting a 12 ounce bag of Kisses or more, stick with 60 seconds to start. If you're melting less than that, start with 30 seconds and monitor closely."

      "content": "Continue heating in 15 second intervals until fully melted. Stir between each heating. Stirring will help distribute the heat and melt the chocolate. Stir well and make sure you need more heat before attempting to microwave again. Once the chocolate appears smooth and lump-free, it’s fully melted. Avoid continuing to heat them after this point, since overheating can affect the chocolate’s consistency and texture. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Use the melted chocolate immediately. Whether you’re using it in a recipe, drizzling it over ice cream, or using it some other way, melted Kisses should be used quickly. As the chocolate cools, it will harden back up and no longer be malleable."

You can make one easily with a deep saucepan (for boiling the water) and a heat-safe bowl that fits snugly on top of the saucepan (to melt the chocolate). Choose a bowl that is shallower than the saucepan. [9] X Research source Once you’ve added water to the saucepan and placed the bowl over it, the bottom of the bowl should not be touching the water. Leave about an inch (2.5 cm) between the water and top bowl. The fit should be snug enough that no steam will be able to escape from beneath the bowl. [10] X Research source"

      "content": "Unwrap the Kisses and place them in the heat-safe bowl. Chopping them coarsely first will make them melt faster, but it’s not necessary. You can just unwrap the candies and drop them in the bowl, as is. Fill the bowl up about halfway. If you have more candy than that, work in batches. Set the bowl aside. There are 72 individually wrapped candies in a standard 12 ounce bag of Kisses. If you melt all of them, you'll end up with about 1.5 cups (350 ml) of melted chocolate."

If you need to, go ahead and double check your water level by placing the bowl on top. Once everything looks good, remove the bowl and turn on the heat. [11] X Research source When the bowl is in place over the saucepan, the water should come to just underneath it, but not touch it. Aim for about an inch (2.5 cm) of space between them."
