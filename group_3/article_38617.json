      "title": "Remove a pen from the refrigerator and inspect it.",
      "content": "Remove a pen from the refrigerator and inspect it. Take a dose tray out of the carton and open it. The dose tray contains a pre-filled pen and an alcohol swab, which you’ll use to sanitize the injection site.Check that the expiration dates listed on the carton, tray, and pen match, and make sure the product has not expired. [1] X Research source Look into the view window in the pen to inspect the liquid inside. Don’t use the pen if you see particles, flakes, discoloration, cloudiness, or signs that the pen is damaged. The liquid should look clear, but it’s normal if it has a few bubbles."

      "title": "Set the pen, the alcohol pad, and a cotton ball on a clean, flat surface.",
      "content": "Set the pen, the alcohol pad, and a cotton ball on a clean, flat surface. Sanitize a tabletop with surface cleaner or use a clean tray as your workstation. Store smaller pieces in plastic containers so they are organized. In addition to the pen and alcohol pad, you'll need a cotton ball later in the process, so grab one from your medicine cabinet. [2] X Research source The dose tray doesn't include a cotton ball, which you'll hold against the injection site after administering your medication. Gauze will also do the trick if you don't have cotton balls handy. You should also have a sharps container handy so you can dispose of the pen after using it. The pen is fragile and made of glass, so setting it on a clean, flat surface is important. Do not use a pen if you dropped it."

      "title": "Allow the pen to warm to room temperature for 15 to 30 minutes.",
      "content": "Allow the pen to warm to room temperature for 15 to 30 minutes. For most people, injecting Humira after letting it warm for 15 to 30 minutes is more comfortable than injecting it cold. Warm your medication at room temperature only. Do not microwave it, set it in hot water, or warm it by any other means. [3] X Research source Leave the gray and plum-colored caps on either end of the pen while the dose reaches room temperature. Don’t remove the caps until immediately before you inject Humira. While your medication warms up, you can sanitize your injection site."

    {
      "title": "Wash your hands",
      "content": "Wash your hands with soap and hot water. Wash up thoroughly for at least 20 seconds before sanitizing your injection site. [4] X Trustworthy Source Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Main public health institute for the US, run by the Dept. of Health and Human Services Go to source After washing your hands, dry them well with a clean paper towel. [5] X Research source Humira can weaken your immune system and put you at a higher risk of infection. Because of this, washing your hands and sanitizing the injection site is essential."

      "content": "Choose a blemish-free spot on your stomach or thigh. Inject Humira into the front or side of a thigh, or your stomach at least 2 in (5.1 cm) from your navel. Make sure the injection site is free of cuts, bruises, stretch marks, redness, soreness, or scarring. If you have psoriasis, avoid injecting Humira into plaques.

      "content": "Wipe the site with an alcohol pad using circular motions. Remove the alcohol pad included in the dose tray from its wrapping. Then wipe it over the skin around your chosen injected site for about 20 seconds, and let it dry for a few seconds after. [7] X Research source Don’t touch the injection site or cover it with clothing until you’re ready to administer the injection."

      "content": "Remove the gray and plum caps immediately before injecting yourself. Hold the pen with the gray side up and pull the gray cap straight off of the tip. Turn the pen over so the plum-colored side is up, then pull off the plum cap. [8] X Research source Be sure to pull the caps straight off of the pen instead of twisting them. Don’t try to recap the pen, which could damage the needle or discharge the medication."

      "content": "Squeeze 2 to 3 in (5.1 to 7.6 cm) of skin around the injection site. Hold the pen in your dominant hand and, with the other, gently pinch the skin around the injection site. Don’t touch the exact spot where you’ll inject the pen. Just squeeze the area around it firmly enough to raise the skin. [9] X Research source Keep squeezing your skin gently while you inject the medication. Squeezing your skin helps make the injection less uncomfortable."

      "content": "Place the white end of the pen flat against the injection site. Hold the pen with the view window facing you and the white arrows pointing toward the injection site. Press the white end, which is the needle cover, against the area of skin you’ve raised. [10] X Research source Be sure to hold the pen flat against your skin so it forms a 90-degree angle with the injection site."

      "content": "Press the plum-colored button to begin the injection. Push the pen down firmly against the injection site before starting it. Press down on the plum activator and count to 15 seconds. The needle itself is tiny, and you may just feel a pinch or prick. Humira can cause pain or a burning sensation once it’s injected, so you may experience some discomfort. Warming Humira for about 30 minutes and pinching your skin while you inject Humira help minimize discomfort. Different people experience varying degrees of discomfort after the injection. Some people experience slight discomfort or pain at the injection site for 1 or 2 minutes. Others feel sore for several hours or up to a few days after the injection."

      "content": "Pull the pen away from the injection site slowly. Once the yellow indicator stops moving, slowly lift the pen straight away from your skin. Then gently release the area of skin you’ve been pinching. [12] X Research source The injection site may be sensitive after administering the injection, and it’s normal if you bleed a little after removing the pen. Once you remove the pen, the needle will retract into the white needle cover. Listen for it to click. Don’t try to touch the needle or play with the white cover."

      "content": "Press a clean cotton ball lightly over the injection site. Right after removing the pen, hold the cotton ball to your injection site. Don’t press hard, as the area may be sensitive, and don't rub the injection site after administering your medication. [13] X Research source Hold the cotton ball in place for at least 10 seconds. For some people, sitting still for 5 to 10 minutes after the injection helps minimize discomfort."

If you don’t have a sharps container, ask your doctor to provide you with one. [15] X Research source Don’t discard the sharps container in your regular trash. When it’s nearly full, dispose of it through your doctor’s office or according to your local guidelines. If you live in the U.S., learn about your state’s sharps disposal procedures at https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/consumer-products/safely-using-sharps-needles-and-syringes-home-work-and-travel .

That way, you’ll have a record that you took the last dose, and you’ll know which spot to avoid the next time you choose an injection site. [16] X Research source It’s wise to set reminders on your phone to avoid missing a dose. If you do miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember, unless it’s almost time for your next scheduled dose.
