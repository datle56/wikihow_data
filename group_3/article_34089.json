      "content": "Preheat the oven to 200 °F (93 °C). You don’t need to toss your Play-Doh into a kiln for it to dry. Some Play-Doh hobbyists recommend using a low oven temperature to preserve your creations. [2] X Research source This method works best with small, thin keepsakes, like holiday ornaments."

      "title": "Bake your Play-Doh for 5-10 minutes.",
      "content": "Bake your Play-Doh for 5-10 minutes. Set your Play-Doh creation on an oven-safe tray, and set a timer for at least 5 minutes. Then, check on the baked clay to see if it’s hardened. If the clay is firm and hard to the touch, you can display your Play-Doh masterpiece around your home! [3] X Research source If your Play-Doh isn’t quite hardened, you might have more luck sealing it."

      "title": "Check the Play-Doh with a toothpick and let it cool.",
      "content": "Check the Play-Doh with a toothpick and let it cool. Gently press a toothpick against the clay to check the hardness. If the Play-Doh feels soft, leave it in the oven for a couple more minutes. If your Play-Doh creation is hardened, pull it out of the oven so it can cool off. If your Play-Doh sculpture is pretty thick, it might need a little more time in the oven."

      "title": "Air-dry the Play-Doh for 1-3 days before sealing it.",
      "content": "Air-dry the Play-Doh for 1-3 days before sealing it. Play-Doh is meant to be reused, so the compound is naturally moist and flexible. Before sealing your creation, place it in an open area for at least 1 day so it can air-dry. You might see a white crust forming on the dough—this is totally normal, and is just the salt in the Play-Doh rising to the top. Don’t worry about fixing this, since it isn’t very noticeable. [4] X Research source You’ll only be air-drying your Play-Doh for a short amount of time, so it shouldn’t start cracking."

      "title": "Seal your Play-Doh creation in sections to prevent sticking.",
      "content": "Seal your Play-Doh creation in sections to prevent sticking. Apply your sealant of choice to the top and sides of your creation first. Then, let the sealant try completely. [5] X Research source At this point, coat the other side of your Play-Doh creation with sealant. Some people only seal the parts of their creation that will be visible to the naked eye.

      "title": "Coat the Play-Doh with school glue as an easy, non-toxic solution.",
      "content": "Coat the Play-Doh with school glue as an easy, non-toxic solution. Pour 1 ⁄ 2 tsp (2.5 mL) or so of water into a small cup. Then, mix 2 drops of school glue into the water. Dip a small, clean paintbrush into the glue mixture and spread it all over your Play-Doh creation. Let the first layer of glue dry completely, and then add a second layer for good measure. [7] X Research source If the glaze seems too runny, add another drop or 2 of glue into the mixture. This glue takes about an hour to set, and a full day to cure."

Wait 3 days for your Play-Doh to dry, and then add 2 more coats, giving each layer another 3 days to air-dry. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Cover the Play-Doh with clear nail polish for a fast-drying option. Grab a bottle of clear nail polish and spread a thin layer over your clay creation. Check the side of the bottle for the recommended drying time. [9] X Research source This is a better solution for smaller projects. If your finished project doesn’t look very glossy, you might want to add a second coat of nail polish. [10] X Research source"

Spread a thin coat of the product all over your Play-Doh, so it’s protected with a nice, hard coating. Scan over the resin bottle to see what the recommended drying time is.
