      "content": "Go shopping. All of the supplies necessary will be found at an aquarium or pet store; you can shop online if that is more convenient. You will need many supplies for your brine shrimp tank, including: 10 gallon tank Sponge filter (that comes with a tube, a sponge, and a hookup for the air pump) Air pump Tank heater and thermometer A package of brine shrimp cysts (eggs) Aquarium salt mix (setting up a brand new aquarium means you will need about 13 pounds of salt per 50 gallons) 1 gallon container with a lid 10 gallons reverse osmosis water Refractometer or hydrometer for measuring salinity Gravel vacuum Flashlight"

      "title": "Determine the best location for the tank.",
      "content": "Determine the best location for the tank. Saltwater tanks should not be near any windows, doors, heater vents, direct sunlight, or air conditioners so the temperature of the water does not change rapidly. The tank should also be set up near electrical outlets because you will need to plug in the heater and air pump. Leave room between the tank and the wall so the air pump will easily fit. The surface should also be level."

      "content": "Fill the tank with a saltwater mixture. Make a saltwater mixture with aquarium salt and reverse osmosis filtered water. [2] X Research source Fill the 10 gallon tank with 9 gallons of water so there is room for the salt. Then, add the salt per manufacturer’s instructions. The salt container will have specific instructions for calculating the amount of salt necessary for your tank. Don’t worry if you add too much or too little salt; you can adjust the levels before adding the brine shrimp cysts."

      "title": "Track the salinity with a refractometer or a hydrometer.",
      "content": "Track the salinity with a refractometer or a hydrometer. The salinity of the tank should always be 30-35 ppt (parts per thousand).Use the instructions for your refractometer or hydrometer to measure the salinity of the tank, and add more salt or more reverse osmosis water accordingly. Operating the refractometer or hydrometer involves placing some of the water inside via a dropper or other apparatus. Test the water until you reach the correct salinity. If you’ve mixed the saltwater correctly according to the manufacturer’s instructions, you will not have to tinker with the mixture."

      "title": "Set up a slow air-powered sponge filter.",
      "content": "Set up a slow air-powered sponge filter. This is the best filter to use in the tank because it will provide aeration, filter the tank water, and won’t suck up the tiny brine shrimp. The filter should include a tube, a sponge, and a hookup for the air pump; if it does not include the hookup for the pump, buy this separately. You can place the sponge filter on the bottom of the tank or mount it to the side of the tank, depending on the model you purchased. There are many cheap filters on the market nowadays, but do not scrimp on filtering equipment. Faulty filters may cause the brine shrimp to die. [3] X Research source"

Once both the heater and thermometer are installed, you can adjust the heater so the tank is always at the correct temperature: 68°F (20°C)-79°F (25°C). Turn it up or down accordingly."

Check the temperature at least twice a day—if the heater is accidentally unplugged or the temperature drastically changes for any reason, your brine shrimp could die."

You do not need to aid them in hatching or growing, since they will do so naturally in a well-maintained tank. If your brine shrimp are not growing or hatching, check the salinity and temperature of the tank for problems. It is natural for some of the brine shrimp to die."

Always having a gallon of saltwater ready will make changing the water much easier. Fill a gallon container with reverse osmosis water. Add the salt per manufacturer’s instructions. Cap the container, and store the saltwater in a cool, dry area until you need it."

[7] X Research source Turn off the aeration and circulation system before changing the water. Let the air in the tank settle so it is not moving. Shine a bright light at the surface of the tank so the brine shrimp all flock to it. Siphon the dirty water off the bottom of the tank with the gravel vacuum. Then, replace the siphoned water with some of the marine salt mixture you made earlier. Check the salinity and temperature of the tank to make sure the levels are good."

      "title": "Rinse or replace the sponge filter every 1-4 weeks.",
      "content": "Rinse or replace the sponge filter every 1-4 weeks. The sponge filter may get noticeably dirty. To rinse or replace the filter, turn off the air pump, remove the sponge, and rinse it in the used tank water, or non-chlorinated (conditioned with Prime or other conditioner) room temperature-or current temperature of your aquarium water. When it is clean again, replace it, and turn the air pump back on. You will only need to get a brand new sponge if it disintegrates. It houses useful bacteria to keep the tank healthy. Never rinse the sponge or any other filter in anything other than used tank water or conditioned water. To rinse filter media in too hot, too cold or chlorinated water destroys the bacteria that supports a healthy tank. Use a flashlight to herd the brine shrimp away from the sponge filter when doing this. You may need someone to help you grab the filter or shine the light."
