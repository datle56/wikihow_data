      "content": "Pick a fun, simple design for your needle punch project. When you are just starting out, you may want to practice doing a small, simple design. Look online for inspiration or sketch your own design on a piece of paper. Designs with larger blocks of color will be easier than intricate fine lines. To make your life easier, consider using a symmetrical design, so it doesn’t matter which side is the front or back."

      "title": "Purchase enough weavers cloth for your project.",
      "content": "Purchase enough weavers cloth for your project. Get enough fabric to easily fit your design plus a few extra inches around the sides so that you can attach the embroidery hoop. Weavers cloth is a kind of woven cotton and polyester blend that will hold your needle punch stitches in place. If you are needle punching a rug, you will need a heavier weight weavers cloth than if you are making a pillow. You can buy weavers cloth online or at a craft store. [1] X Research source As an alternative, you can also use denim or a poly-cotton twill, but they won’t work as well as weavers cloth. Monk's cloth is another good option for this type of project. [2] X Expert Source Sarah Stearns DIY Specialist Expert Interview. 4 October 2021. If you use a cotton fabric like muslin, the fibers might tear when you try to punch needle. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Draw your pattern onto your fabric in reverse.",
      "content": "Draw your pattern onto your fabric in reverse. You can use a fabric pencil, a normal pencil, or even a marker, since the marks will be covered with stitches anyways. When you punch needle, you will create a side with loops and a side with flat stitches. The loops will be on the back as you create the design, but most people want them on the front for the finished design, so you have to draw your design in reverse. That way, when you flip over the pattern, it will be in the right direction. [4] X Research source If you prefer to have the loops on the back of your fabric, you can draw your design normally, not in reverse. If you chose a symmetrical design, it won’t matter whether you draw it in reverse or not."

      "content": "Use tracing paper to transfer your design in reverse as an alternative. If you don’t want to draw your design by hand, you can transfer it onto your fabric with tracing paper. Put a sheet of tracing paper down on your fabric. Print out your picture, and put it face down on top of the tracing paper. Draw over all the lines in the drawing with a pencil, and the tracing paper will leave marks in the shape of your design on the fabric. [5] X Research source If you want the loops to be on the back of your design, trace the printed image face up instead of face down."

Loosen the screw on the outside of the large hoop until you can easily pop it off the small hoop. Lay the fabric over the small hoop so that your design is centered in the hoop.

Turn the screw on the outer hoop so that it is tight around the inner hoop.

      "content": "Get embroidery floss in all the colors you need for your design. You get to decide what colors you use. For example, if you are making a tree, you might want brown, red, and a few kinds of green. Make sure to buy embroidery floss, not sewing thread. Embroidery floss is thread that is twisted so that it has 6 strands, so it is thicker than the thread you would use for sewing. You can use cotton or wool embroidery floss."

Push the metal threader through the front of the punch needle, at the hollow tip of the needle.

Leave 1 inch (2.5 cm) or more of tail, so that when you pull the threader through the needle punch, the floss won’t slip off. [9] X Research source Remember to use the color of floss that you want to stitch first in your design."

Your floss should be coming out the front of your punch needle. Take the string off the back of the metal threader so that it is dangling freely. [10] X Research source If the threader didn’t bring the floss with it, try again with a longer tail."

      "content": "Put your needle threader through the eye in the tip of your needle. The tip of your needle punch has a scooped out front, called the bevel, and a smooth back. The smooth back has a little hole it in, called an eye. Put your needle threader through this eye, so that the threader is sticking out into the beveled part of the tip. [11] X Research source It might take you a few tries to get the metal threader through the small eye. Working under a bright light should help if you’re struggling with this step."

      "content": "Set the loop length using the slider on the side of the needle punch. The higher the number, the longer the loop will be. Start with a setting in the middle. If you don’t like the loop after a few stitches, you can easily pull out the stitches and reset the length. [13] X Research source You can also check the instructions that come with your specific punch needle to see what loop length they recommend. Keep in mind that the longer loops you have, the more floss you will use, which can add up in cost if you do a lot of needle punching."

The bevel, which is the scooped-out, open side of the needle, always needs to face the direction of your stitches.

You can spiral in toward the inside or start at one end and fill in rows all the way until the other side. Keep your rows so close together that the floss touches.

Place the sharp end of the needle on the pattern, punch directly through the fabric so that the depth gauge touches the fabric. Flip your hoop over so that you can see the front side, and pull the tail of floss through. [18] X Research source You’ll trim this tail at the end of the project, so don’t worry about it now.

Punch the needle through the fabric again until the needle is fully through and the plastic part of the pen touches the fabric. Then slowly remove the needle back towards you. [20] X Research source It’s important to be gentle, because if you tug backwards on the floss, all your stitches will unravel.

Pull the needle punch out very carefully on your last stitch so that you don’t accidentally unravel your hard work. Trim the floss so that it is very close to the fabric. Trim the tail that’s sticking out from the beginning of your stitching, too. [23] X Research source If you want, you can push the end of the floss out through the other side of the fabric using your metal threader, so that the floss pokes out onto the loop side."

Then, you don’t have to go to the trouble of buying a frame and making sure the fabric is stretched tight enough. If you don’t like the embroidery hoop you used for the needle punching, you could paint it or buy a prettier frame."

One easy way to measure how big the felt should be is to stick it in the embroidery hoop, and then trim the edges until there is about 1 inch (2.5 cm) all the way around. [24] X Research source Your measurements don’t have to be exact – you just want enough fabric to be able to glue down the back."

Instead of leaving the design mounted in your house, turning it into a patch lets you wear it on your clothes or tote bags. Patches can also make cool homemade gifts."
