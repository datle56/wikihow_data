However, if your nodes continue to grow or harden, it may be time to talk with your doctor. They will likely do a physical exam and may order blood tests or a scan, depending on the possible diagnosis. [6] X Research source See a doctor if your lymph nodes are still swollen after 1 week, as persistent swelling may indicate a serious underlying infection or disease. Swollen lymph nodes can be caused by various infections, including mononucleosis, tuberculosis, ear infections, strep throat, and measles.

If your lymph nodes are swelling due to an infection, they usually won’t return to regular size until you return to your normal, healthy self. Waiting to treat any underlying conditions can result in abscesses forming around the swollen nodes. In more extreme cases, you can even suffer from bloodstream poisoning due to bacteria. [7] X Research source Lymph node swelling and tenderness are often caused by a viral infection such as the common cold or flu. Viral infections typically go away on their own without medical intervention, so long as you get plenty of rest. [8] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source A bacterial infection such as mononucleosis or strep throat can cause lymph node swelling and pain as well. Unlike a viral infection, a bacterial infection often requires medical treatment via a prescribed antibiotic for the infection to go away.
