      "content": "While many websites and apps claim they can show you private Instagram profiles, none of them work. Some of these sites seem very convincing, but after much testing, we've found that they are all scams. Most of these fake viewers are mostly harmless—they make money from visitors completing \"verification\" steps, like watching videos and clicking ads to generate ad revenue, but they never show any private Instagram details. Other \"viewers\" are more malicious , asking for peoples' Instagram credentials or credit card information in an attempt to steal that data."

      "content": "Private accounts have private follower lists. Unfortunately, there's no tool or trick that can accurately show you the followers list for a private Instagram account. The only true way to find out who is following a private account is to send them a follow request and wait for them to accept. [2] X Research source If you're feeling nervous about sending a request from your personal Instagram account, you could always create a new account . You might want to focus your new account on something interesting or funny to intrigue the person you want to follow, such as inspiring self-help quotes, hilarious memes , toys from the 2000s, or chihuahuas in costumes."

      "content": "While Googling won't show you who follows the account, you might come across some private photos. This is especially true if the private account was ever public in the past—there's a chance some of the account's photos are available on other websites. If the username is pretty common, try adding \"Instagram\" to your search to narrow down the results.
