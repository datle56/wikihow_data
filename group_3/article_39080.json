      "title": "Mark your fabric where you want to sew the bias binding.",
      "content": "Mark your fabric where you want to sew the bias binding. The bias binding will need to cover the raw edge of your fabric, but placing it too close to the raw edge may result in a weak seam. To ensure a strong seam, you will need to place the edge of the binding slightly in from the edge of your fabric. Mark the fabric about 6 millimetres (0.24 in) from the raw (cut) edge to indicate where you will place the edge of the binding."

      "title": "Pin the bias binding to the fabric.",
      "content": "Pin the bias binding to the fabric. Unfold one edge of the bias binding, and line up the raw edges of the bias binding with the chalk line you have marked onto the fabric. The right (front) side of the bias binding and the right (front) side of your fabric should be facing each other. Insert pins through the bias binding and fabric to hold them together. [1] X Research source Make sure to fold under the ends of the bias binding so that the raw edges will not be visible. You can also use clips to hold the bias binding in place. These will prevent you from making holes in the bias binding or fabric, which may be a concern especially if the fabric or binding are made from a delicate material. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Sew along the crease of the bias binding.",
      "content": "Sew along the crease of the bias binding. The bias binding should have folded edges that run the length of the binding. When you open the folds up, you will see that the binding has a crease. Use your sewing machine to sew a straight stitch into this crease to secure your bias binding and fabric together.

      "content": "Press the binding over the seam allowance. After you have sewed the bias binding to the fabric, fold over the bias binding so that it covers the seam allowance of your fabric. Next, use an iron to press this seam and make the bias binding lay flat over the seam allowance. [4] X Research source Use your iron on a low setting or one that is appropriate for your fabric. If you are worried about damaging the fabric, then place a t-shirt or cotton cloth over the fabric before you iron it."

When you get to the end, backstitch by a few stitches to secure the stitches. To backstitch, press the lever on the side of your sewing machine while you are applying gentle pressure to the pedal. After making a few stitches in the opposite direction of the others, take your foot off the pedal and remove the item from the sewing machine."

When you cut your bias binding for the project, make sure that you cut a little more than you will actually need to cover the edges. This will allow you to sew the edges together in a way that will hide the ends of the bias binding. For example, if your project calls for 20 inches (51 cm) of bias binding, then cut 21 inches (53 cm) to ensure that you will have enough to hide the ends."
