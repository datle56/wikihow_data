      "content": "Cut the skin and fat off of the raw chicken. Ideally, use 1-2 boneless, skinless chicken thighs or breasts to make the process easier and skip the trimming.

The AKC advocates for the responsible ownership of dogs and promotes purebred dog events, such as the Westminster Dog Show. Go to source But if you’re using bone-in chicken or chicken with skin, first cut away and discard the skin and fat. You want only the bland meat, which is easiest on your dog’s stomach. Leave the bones in, then remove them after cooking. Or, debone the chicken now. Either option works. If possible, use a thigh or breast cut raised without hormones or additives to avoid feeding your dog extra toxins."

      "title": "Place the chicken in a large pot of boiling water for 20 minutes.",
      "content": "Place the chicken in a large pot of boiling water for 20 minutes. Fill a large pot with enough water to cover the chicken, then bring it to a boil over high heat. Reduce it to medium and place the entire chicken thigh or breast into the pot. Cook the chicken until the meat is fully white inside and a thermometer inserted into the meat reads 165 °F (74 °C)—about 15-20 minutes. [3] X Research source If the chicken is not fully cooked, your dog could be at risk for increased diarrhea and vomiting due to the bacteria found in raw or undercooked chicken. Better to overcook it than undercook it."

      "title": "Remove the chicken from the pot and shred or slice it into chunks.",
      "content": "Remove the chicken from the pot and shred or slice it into chunks. To make the chicken easier to digest, use a fork to shred it, separating it from any bones, or use a knife to cut it into small chunks about 0.5–1 in (1.3–2.5 cm) large.

Go to source Be sure to separate and safely discard any bones, since these can harm your dog’s digestive tract or further upset their stomach. [5] X Research source Save 1–2 c (240–470 mL) of the boiled chicken water and feel free to add it to your dog’s meal later to make it more enticing."

      "title": "Rinse 1 cup (225g) of white rice 3 times under cool water.",
      "content": "Rinse 1 cup (225g) of white rice 3 times under cool water. Measure out your rice and add it to a bowl. Then cover the rice with cool water and, with clean hands, mix and swirl the rice for 10-20 seconds. Carefully pour out the water, then add more and repeat the mixing until the water runs clear. [6] X Research source This step helps remove excess starches and fiber from the rice. Unseasoned white rice is best for dogs with upset stomachs. Though it contains fewer nutrients than brown rice, it’s also much milder and more palatable.

      "content": "Boil the rice for 10 minutes in 2 c (470 mL) of water. Transfer the rice to a pot and add 2 parts of water to 1 part of rice. Bring the pot to a boil over medium heat, then reduce the heat to low. Cover the pot and cook the rice for 10 minutes, or until the water is absorbed and the rice is tender.

      "content": "Withhold all food from a sick dog for 24 hours. If you’re caring for a sick dog with an upset stomach, it’s best not to feed a sick dog anything for a full day. It’s not fun for you or for them, but it gives their digestive system a chance to reset, and the problem may clear up with a little fasting. [9] X Research source During this period, make sure your dog has clean water available at all times."

      "content": "Offer your dog a small 2:1 mixture of cold rice and chicken every 2 hours. Offer your dog 2 parts of rice and 1 part of chicken, in small amounts, and in their regular dish. Start by giving them about ⅓ as much chicken and rice as their normal portion of dog food. Offer them a fresh portion every 2-3 hours. [10] X Research source If your dog eats the full portion, give them a little more the next day, in fewer servings—aim for full portions at your dog’s regular mealtimes. Feel free to store extra or uneaten chicken and rice together in an airtight container in the fridge for 3-4 days, or in the freezer for 2-6 months.

Once your dog has stopped vomiting or having diarrhea, substitute their usual dog food into the chicken and rice a little at a time. [12] X Research source Start with a 1:4 ratio of kibble to chicken and rice, and increase the ratio over 4-5 days, until your dog is back on their normal diet. Be sure to consult your veterinarian about the transition back to normal food. Depending on the dog’s specific condition, you may need to feed the dog a chicken-and-rice diet longer than a few days."
