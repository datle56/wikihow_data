Focus the file on the edge and the free walls of each nail. [1] X Research source Use a medium 100/180 grit nail file . The 180-grit side will be coarse enough to file through a layer of builder gel, but not so sharp that you'll easily damage your natural nail. [2] X Research source"

Ensure each piece is sealed all around your finger, as well as on top of it. This will keep the nails warm and let the acetone do its work.

The plastic makes a better seal, but make sure not to wrap it so tightly that you cut off circulation.
