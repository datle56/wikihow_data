When you receive a copyright claim, one of four things may happen depending on the copyright owner's Content ID settings: [5] X Research source Monetization: If your video is monetized, the copyright owner may divert some or all of the funds you receive through advertising to them. If your video is not monetized, they may monetize it and claim all the ad revenue for themselves. Mute your video: The copyright owner may decide to mute the audio on your video. Your video will still be available on YouTube, but the sound will be missing. This will likely result in a significant drop in views. View your analytics: It is possible (though unlikely) that the copyright owner may decide not to take any action against the video or your account. They may instead decide to let your video run as is and track your viewership statistics. Block your video: A copyright owner may block your content. This will prevent it from being viewed on YouTube. DCMA takedown: The most extreme action a copyright holder can take is to file a DCMA complaint and takedown request. If they file a valid complaint, YouTube will remove the video, and you will receive a copyright strike against your channel."

Another option is to contact the copyright owner and ask them to retract their copyright claim. If they agree to do so, the copyright strike will also be retracted. File a counter-notification.
