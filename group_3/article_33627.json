      "content": "Face yourself in the mirror and check if your jawlines taper to a point. Some people with pointed chins have jaw lines that angle in and down toward their chin. The chin looks like the point where the jaw lines meet. This makes the lower half of the face look similar to the point of an upside-down triangle."

      "content": "Contour your cheeks to soften your pointy chin. If you think your pointy chin makes your cheeks look too narrow and your forehead too wide, you can change that in seconds by contouring your face ! Here's how to create the illusion that you have wider cheeks and a less pointy chin: Choose a powdered or liquid foundation (your preference) 4-5 shades darker than your foundation, says licensed esthetician Melissa Jannes. Fill a medium-sized makeup brush with the makeup product. Start at the ear and sweep the contour across your cheek in a straight line toward your nostril. Avoid angling the brush down along your cheekbone toward your mouth, which will draw your face down and emphasize a pointy chin. [1] X Research source Blend the contour \"with a beauty blender or a sponge,\" suggests Jannes. That way, you can get rid of any harsh, dark lines."

Keep in mind that this fix can take up to a few weeks, depending on how fast facial hair grows on your body. To grow a beard faster , focus on washing and moisturizing your beard regularly, eating healthy foods, and exercising to raise your testosterone levels. Facial hair specialist Marlon Rivas says to give your beard at least a month to grow out, and don’t be discouraged if it looks patchy in the meantime. Use beard oil or balm to hydrate and style your beard hair."

      "title": "Fillers",
      "content": "Fillers The only surefire way to make your chin look less pointy without surgery is to get hyaluronic acid (HA) fillers. Hyaluronic acid is a substance your body produces naturally. It cushions your joints and adds volume and hydration to your skin. A licensed dermatologist can inject HA filler into your chin to round it out. This should make it look less pointy. [2] X Research source Keep in mind that HA fillers dissolve over time. You may have to get regular injections every few months to maintain your desired look. [3] X Research source Avoid wearing makeup \"before or at least 24 hours after the treatment,\" cautions board-certified plastic surgeon Edward S. Kwak, MD. Filler infections are rare, he says, but leaving the makeup off for a day will help minimize the risk even more."

      "title": "Ultrasound therapy",
      "content": "Ultrasound therapy Some people have pointier chins because the skin around their chin is sagging. The sagging skin creates a fold, which makes the chin look like it sticks further out than normal. Ultrasound therapy uses ultrasound waves to stimulate collagen growth deep under the skin. Over time, the new collagen helps the skin around the chin look less saggy and more toned. That way, your chin isn't as prominent on your face. [4] X Research source After your ultrasound therapy procedure, you might experience some swelling, tenderness, and tingling in your face. But that's about it! Expect to see improvements in your chin within 2-6 months."

      "content": "Chin reduction Chin reduction surgery (also called sliding genioplasty) is a procedure that can reduce your chin size. The goal is to ensure it doesn't jut out so far away from the rest of your face. During the surgery, the surgeon will make an incision in your mouth or underneath your chin. Then they'll shave away or cut off parts of your chin bone to reshape it and make it smaller. Along the way, they'll make sure your \"new\" chin is symmetrical with your jaw bones and other facial features. When they're done, they'll stitch up the incision. [7] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source For 2-3 days after the surgery, your doctor may tell you to eat soft or liquid foods only. But after 1-2 weeks, depending on how well you recover, you should be able to return to your normal diet and resume your regular activities. Your chin may feel tender for a few days, and you'll likely form a bruise on it, too."

      "content": "Aging As humans age, we naturally lose muscle strength, fat, and bone density in different parts of our bodies, especially the face. [9] X Research source Sometimes the skin around the chin sags, creating a fold that makes the chin look like it's sticking out. This is called chin ptosis or witch's chin. [10] X Research source A dramatic example of this process is Sunita Williams, a NASA astronaut who was stranded on the International Space Station (ISS) for 9 months in 2024-25. In outer space, the lack of gravity speeds up bone and fat loss. It also causes muscles to atrophy, or become weaker. As a result, when Williams finally returned to Earth on March 18, 2025, her chin was noticeably longer and pointier than it was when she first went up. [11] X Research source"

      "content": "Pointy chins can absolutely be attractive, especially on women. Women with slightly pointy chins are often described as more delicate, feminine, and elfin than women with square or round chins. A pointed chin can also complement an oval or heart face shape, as long as it's proportional to the jawlines and other facial features. Others may not love the look of a pointy chin. However, there's nothing wrong with having a pointed chin, and there's also no one universally attractive chin type. Everybody has their own preferences! [12] X Research source"

      "content": "Chin augmentation surgery If you want a permanently pointier chin, chin augmentation may be your best option. In this procedure, the surgeon either inserts an implant into your chin or reshapes your jaw bones to push your chin forward. [13] X Trustworthy Source MedlinePlus Collection of medical information sourced from the US National Library of Medicine Go to source If they insert an implant , they'll cut into your mouth or chin to make a pocket where they can slide the implant inside. They'll attach it to your bones with stitches or screws, then suture the cut closed. If they reshape your jaw , they'll make cuts inside your mouth to access your chin and jaw bones. Then they'll move the jaw bone where they want to it go and screw or wire it closed. The implant can be made of fat or bone tissue, or a synthetic material like silicone. Recovery time varies from patient to patient. But in general, you can expect to be able to go back to work or school and all your other regular activities within 7-10 days."

In other words, it won't make your chin permanently pointier.

There’s also no scientific proof that jaw exercises like chin tucks or ceiling kisses work."

If you have a pointy chin and want it to look rounder, you might be able to use fillers or surgery to get your desired look. If you want a pointier, more prominent chin for selfies, you can try mewing or talk to a plastic surgeon about getting an implant or a reshaped jaw. Just make sure you're changing your chin because you want to and not to live up to society's impossible beauty standards."
