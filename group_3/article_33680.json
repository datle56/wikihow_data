      "title": "Wash your car or boat with soap and water.",
      "content": "Wash your car or boat with soap and water. Select a car soap if you’re working on a vehicle or a marine soap if you’re polishing a boat. Mix the soap with warm water, then apply it with a sponge or cloth. Rinse it off, then dry the moisture off with a clean cloth. Check afterward for any remaining debris that has to be removed before polishing. Check the manufacturer’s recommendation before diluting the soap. The ratio is usually something like 1 fluid ounce (0.030 L) per every 1 US gal (3.8 L), but it can vary between products. Make sure you are able to remove all debris so the buffer doesn’t grind it into your car or boat."

      "title": "Select a random orbital buffer if you are new to machine polishing.",
      "content": "Select a random orbital buffer if you are new to machine polishing. A random orbital buffer, also known as a dual-action polisher, is gentler on surfaces than the other options you could use. The buffer rotates in different directions, making it less likely to leave scratches. It will still leave a nice shine on your car or boat, however. You could also use a rotary buffer, which polishes at a higher speed. Rotary buffers spin in one direction, making them stronger but more likely to leave marks on a surface. Orbital buffers are more expensive than rotary buffers and can’t polish out imperfections like existing scratches. Handheld buffers are available online and at most hardware stores."

      "title": "Apply 4 pea-sized drops of polish to the pad.",
      "content": "Apply 4 pea-sized drops of polish to the pad. Select a quality vehicle polish for cars or a marine polish if you’re working on a boat. Apply the polish around the middle part of the pad. This may not seem like enough, but less is often more when you’re using a buffer. [1] X Research source You don’t have to spread the polish across the entire buffer pad. When you operate the buffer, the motion of the pad will spread it out. You can also add the polish directly to the surface you’re polishing. Remember to spread the polish around with the buffer pad before turning it on."
    },
    {
      "title": "Turn the buffer on and lower it onto the surface.",
      "content": "Turn the buffer on and lower it onto the surface. Position the buffer so its pad is as level as possible with the part you’re going to polish. Keep a firm grip on the back end of the buffer as well as the handle on the front, but hold it down with a light amount of pressure. Switch on the power button in the back, then hold the buffer still for about 2 to 3 seconds. The initial rotations will spread the polish across the pad. [2] X Research source While the buffer is off, you could rub it across the panel to spread the polish. Some people prefer doing it this way to achieve a more consistent finish."

    {
      "title": "Sweep the buffer gradually along the panel.",
      "content": "Sweep the buffer gradually along the panel. Move from left to right or right to left. Use your front hand to push the buffer at a slow but steady pace. At the end of each stroke, move the buffer up or down to go back in the opposite direction. Overlap strokes minimally to achieve a consistent polish. [3] X Research source Keep the buffer moving at all times. If it lingers in one area for too long, it will leave scratches. Some people prefer moving the buffer in a circle. It doesn’t really matter which way you do it, but a circular motion can help you polish broad panels a little faster. Go back over the surface a second time if it doesn’t look as good as you would like. However, remember to apply additional polish first."

      "content": "Polish 2 ft × 2 ft (0.61 m × 0.61 m) sections at a time. Take your time when using a buffer. Polish dries quickly, and you won’t get a great finish by rushing. Instead, tackle each panel on your car or boat individually. Apply fresh polish for each one. [4] X Research source Start with an inconspicuous area first, like the trunk, to test the buffer. Take care of the broad, flat panels afterward. That will leave the tough-to-reach spots, but you can take your time and tackle them one by one."

      "title": "Wipe off the excess polish with a clean microfiber cloth.",
      "content": "Wipe off the excess polish with a clean microfiber cloth. Wait for the polish to dry or turn clear. Most products will dry out by the time you finish buffing the car or boat. Wipe down the entire buffed area, then inspect it for consistency. Then, tackle any remaining panels that need to be polished to make your car or boat shine. [5] X Research source Sometimes, especially with weaker orbital buffers, the finish won’t look consistent after the first treatment. If you notice swirls or other marks, apply a second coat of polish with the buffer. Note that polishing is a slow process even when you have a good buffer. Take your time to ensure the finish turns out right."

      "content": "Mop the floor with soapy water to clear away any debris. Move all of the furniture out of the room first. Then, select a floor cleaner matching the kind of floor you’re polishing. After mixing it with warm water, clean the floor with a microfiber mop. Wait about 30 minutes for it to dry off.it. [6] X Research source For example, use a marble cleaner to take care of marble floors. Not all floor cleaners work for every type of surface, but you can avoid this by getting a specialty product. Make sure you remove all debris in the room so the buffer doesn’t scratch the floor. The corners are the most difficult part, since a buffer can’t really reach there, so take some extra time to scrub them clean by hand."

      "title": "Mix a buffing compound with water in a spray bottle.",
      "content": "Mix a buffing compound with water in a spray bottle. If you’re using a liquid buffing compound, prepare it in advance so you have it ready when you start the machine. Check the manufacturer’s recommendations to figure out the correct mixing ratio. It will be something like 1 part buffing compound to 2 parts warm water. [7] X Research source Another option is to get a buffing cream. Creams can be poured directly onto the floor and don’t have to be diluted at all."

      "title": "Mount a buffing pad to the bottom of the machine.",
      "content": "Mount a buffing pad to the bottom of the machine. Stand behind the machine and pull the back handles down. The machine will tip over, revealing the spot for the pad. If there isn’t already a pad in place, press a one onto the machine with the abrasive side down. Give the pad a quarter turn counterclockwise to lock it in place. [8] X Research source Use a pad that polishes at a rate of 175 to 600 rpm. The pads are color-coded by abrasiveness, so stick to the light-colored ones. White pads are fine for most applications. Center the pad as much as possible to ensure it rests flat against the floor. If it is uneven, it will also polish the floor at an uneven rate. Floor buffers are available at most hardware stores and can often be rented there as well."

      "content": "Pull the handlebars down to balance the buffer’s weight. Squeeze the upper and lower handlebars to unlock the buffer. Pull the handle down until it’s about at waist-height. Adjust it until it’s at a comfortable height. Make sure the buffing pad also stays level with the ground. [9] X Research source You should be able to hold onto the handle without bending your arms. Keep the handle close to your body so you don’t have to bend forward. Many buffers have a control in the front that you can use to raise or lower the pad. Adjust it so the pad barely touches the floor. If you aren’t comfortable now, you will quickly tire out when operating the buffer. Take your time adjusting it so you don’t end up straining to control it later."

Mist the surrounding floor with a light coating of the diluted buffing compound. Make sure the floor is consistently covered but not soaked with excess moisture. Treat only the area in front of the buffer for now. [10] X Research source You can also apply the compound with a mop. It works with creams as well. It is possible to apply the compound while you’re operating the buffer. Hold onto the buffer with one hand while misting the floor ahead of you. If you’re having a hard time with it, stop the buffer to apply the compound at your own pace."

      "content": "Turn on the buffer by squeezing the handlebars together. Operate the buffer only over areas you have treated with a buffing compound. When you’re ready, stand up straight with a good grip on the handle. Hold it away from your waist. Press the safety lock button on top of the handle before squeezing the handlebars in order to turn on the machine. [11] X Research source Before beginning, plan your route through the room. Make sure you are able to work towards an exit so you don’t have to walk over the freshly-buffered floor."

      "title": "Sweep the buffer from side to side across the floor.",
      "content": "Sweep the buffer from side to side across the floor. Buffers tend to work better when you don’t try pushing them in straight lines. Instead, stand still, keeping a light grip on the handle. Swing the buffer back and forth in arcs no more than 12 in (30 cm) in length. Overlap each pass 1/3 of the way for a consistent polish. [12] X Research source To control the buffer, raise the handle slightly to move it to the right. Lower the handle to make it go to the left. If you lose control of the buffer, release the lower handles. It won’t go shooting off on its own. The safety switch will cause it to shut down."

      "content": "Polish the rest of the floor after spraying it with a buffing compound. Complete the area treated with the buffing compound first. When you’re done, you can stop the buffer to mist the area you plan on polishing next. Work along the width each time, gradually working your way to the door. When you’re done, turn off the buffer to admire your shiny floor. [13] X Research source Working along the room’s width ensures that you finish the back part of the room first. If you’re not careful, you will end up walking across wet polish! If the floor doesn’t look as clean as you would like, buff it again with more polish."
