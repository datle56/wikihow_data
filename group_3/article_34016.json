      "title": "Eat your normal meals on the day of your procedure.",
      "content": "Eat your normal meals on the day of your procedure. A full stomach usually won’t affect a pelvic ultrasound, so it’s okay to eat regular meals. You don’t need to change your diet or avoid any particular foods. Go ahead and eat whatever you want. It's okay to drink caffeinated products prior to an ultrasound, so you can have coffee, soda, and other caffeinated drinks. It won't cause dehydration or make it harder for you to fill your bladder. A pelvic ultrasound is different from an abdominal ultrasound, which does require fasting."

Use the restroom before you start drinking fluids so you start with an empty bladder. Then, drink at least 4 cups (0.95 L) of any fluids about an hour before the exam. You may need to drink more if your bladder fills slowly. [6] X Trustworthy Source Johns Hopkins Medicine Official resource database of the world-leading Johns Hopkins Hospital Go to source If you don’t need to urinate very often, you may have a slow filling bladder, which means you should drink more. It’s best to relieve your bladder before you fill it up so that you don’t have a restroom emergency before you get your ultrasound. When your bladder is full, it pushes your intestines aside so it’s easier to view your abdomen."
