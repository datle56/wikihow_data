Somebody else’s approval or disapproval doesn’t determine your happiness. If you love writing stories even though others find it to be a waste of time, keep writing to your heart’s content.

When you experience this kind of judgment, you’ll likely see that it isn’t the end of the world. Don’t give the people who judge you any power by being aggressive or hurling insults back at them. Instead, take a deep breath and tell yourself that their words can’t hurt you. No matter what they say, your life will go on.

Find people who share your interests and genuinely want to see you achieve your goals and live your best life."

In 5 years, the people who judged you probably won’t even remember you, much less all the things about you that they didn’t like. Similarly, their opinions likely won’t impact you at all a few months down the road. Spend your time enjoying your life and take advantage of the many opportunities life has to offer. You’ll probably be much happier than if you spent all that time trying to win the approval of people you probably won’t even see in a few years.

Instead of focusing on what could go wrong, remind yourself of all of the positive things that could happen. The power of positivity is what will help you pick yourself up ready to try again.

Go and hug your mom, tell your friend how much you appreciate them, go out and appreciate nature, or just take a moment to write down everything you’re grateful for. Even when things go wrong, there is usually always something to be thankful for to remind us of the things that are going well in our lives.

But if you understand why and accept the fact that things go wrong, you’ll be able to move on from them quicker. Put things into perspective and tell yourself that this isn’t the end of the world. Also, remind yourself that you can’t control everything. Sometimes things just happen, and that’s okay. [7] X Research source A good way to practice letting go of things that you can’t control is to think logically about how this mistake or bad situation will affect you in the future. Oftentimes, we tend to exaggerate how much our lives will be affected by one tiny mistake. Think about the outcomes in a rational way, and you might find that your worries were for nothing."

But you can choose to pick yourself up and move on. Take some time to analyze and learn from your mistakes , but move forward with the ultimate goal of starting fresh. A huge part of not caring is leaving the past in the past and simply living in the present .

[9] X Research source There are a number of reasons why people hurt other people, both intentionally or unintentionally. Maybe they hurt you because they are hurt, lonely, or afraid.
