      "content": "The 🤓 (nerd) emoji refers to someone who seems nerdy. Anyone who is a self-proclaimed \"geek,\" has traditionally nerdy interests, or even someone who wears glasses can be described with the 🤓 emoji in a text. When someone sends the 🤓 emoji while discussing a person or their interests, they're saying that person is a nerd. [1] X Research source \"I love meeting fellow nerds. 🤓\" \"I met a guy who could recite the periodic table from memory. It was crazy! 🤓\" \"Got new glasses today! I'm going for that sophisticated nerdy look. 🤓\""

      "content": "A 🤓 (nerd) emoji represents being smart. When someone feels particularly clever, they might add a 🤓 emoji to their text or social media post. Nerds are usually thought to be pretty smart, so the 🤓 emoji, in turn, describes an intelligent person. [2] X Research source \"My mom is the smartest person I know. She figured out how to remodel the house all by herself! 🤓\" \"Feeling pretty great today! Just aced my trigonometry test!! 🤓\" \"I made the honor roll this semester!

      "content": "The 🤓 (nerd) emoji signifies learning and reading. When someone learns a new skill, they might add a 🤓 emoji to their text to express their genuine interest and pride in whatever they learned. Since nerds often have academic interests, the emoji can also mean that someone is an avid reader. \"Spent the whole day learning how to draw in Photoshop . 🤓\" \"No matter how much cool tech they make, reading is always my favorite pastime. 🤓\" \"Okay, but learning how to knit a scarf is genuinely fun. 🤓\""

Plenty of people like things that are considered nerdy—things like film franchises, video games, superhero characters, and more. A 🤓 emoji is a fun, easy way to say, \"I'm geeking out about this interest,\" and emphasize a person's love for it. [3] X Research source \"Why yes, I do host a yearly Lord of the Rings rewatch party and make my own lembas bread. 🤓\" \"I could talk about how great the Assassin's Creed games are for DAYS. 🤓🎮\" \"Showed my friends a PowerPoint presentation about the history and production of coffee!

      "content": "Nerd emojis generally have a positive tone but can be self-deprecating. When you see a 🤓 (nerd) emoji, it's safe to assume that it isn't being used to insult you unless the rest of the message is also obviously rude. Most often, a 🤓 emoji is a fun way to depict a competent, knowledgable person. If someone describes themselves with the emoji, they could be gently poking fun at their own \"nerdy\" interests. [4] X Research source For example, the emoji isn't used to text mean things like, \"You're a pathetic nerd. 🤓\" Instead, it's used affectionately to say something like, \"I love that you're such a Marvel nerd! 🤓\""

When you want to poke fun at yourself for doing something that's especially nerdy, include the 🤓 emoji in your post or message. Keep in mind that it shouldn't be used to put yourself down—just acknowledge how passionate you are about your interests in a lighthearted way. [6] X Research source \"Not me replaying Skyrim for the 8th time, even though I know it inside and out, because there's a new mod I want to try. 🤓\" \"I wasn't doing too great on trivia night…until the category about classic cinema came up. 🤓\""
