      "content": "“Ring Around the Rosie” could allude to the Great Plague of 1665. The Great Plague was the worst plague outbreak to hit England since 1348’s Black Death, in which London lost 15% of its population. [1] X Research source Those with the bubonic plague would experience fevers, delirium, swelling, cramps, and bloody coughs. [2] X Research source Some believe that the lyrics in “Ring Around the Rosie” are an allusion to this deadly time. The “rosie” or “roses” in the rhyme can be interpreted as a euphemism for plague fever rashes. The “pocket full of posies” may be directly linked to the flowers used to cover the stench of disease. [3] X Research source “Ashes, ashes” is thought to represent the cremation of bodies. “We all fall down” could be a physical and verbal indication of death."

      "content": "Some argue that “Ring Around the Rosie” is just a nursery rhyme. They say isn’t about the plague at all. [4] X Research source The first known published record of the rhyme comes from the mid-1800s, 200 years after the Great Plague. Because of this, many historians and folklorists suspect that “Ring Around the Rosie” wasn’t about the plague but was actually just a sweet song for children to sing. The interpretation of the rhyme has changed over time, especially as we learn more about historical contexts and significant events. The interpretation of the rhyme as a nod to the plague is considered metafolklore, or the concept of interpreting folklore or traditional beliefs using other folklore and tales.

      "content": "“Ring Around the Rosie” isn’t the only nursery rhyme with a dark meaning. Believe it or not, children’s fairy tales and folklore aren’t always about happily ever after. With historical and metafolklorist contexts, we’re able to decipher the meanings of these seemingly innocent stories. Take a look at some of these popular rhymes and their twisted historical interpretations: “London Bridge is Falling Down” may be about a human sacrifice and burying the remains in the foundation of a bridge. [9] X Research source “Baa Baa Black Sheep” is said to depict the medieval wool tax that left nothing for anyone besides the king or church. [10] X Research source “Jack and Jill” could allude to the French Revolution when Marie Antoinette was beheaded. [11] X Research source “Humpty Dumpty” may be a crude depiction of King Richard III of England, who was defeated in 1485. [12] X Research source"
