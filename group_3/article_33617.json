      "title": "Arrange the raisins in a microwave-safe dish.",
      "content": "Arrange the raisins in a microwave-safe dish. Place the raisins in a microwave-safe plate or bowl, spreading them out so that they lie flat in a single layer. The raisins need to be in a single layer instead of being stacked on top of each other. Keeping the raisins in a single layer will ensure that they absorb the water more evenly during the heating process."

      "content": "Sprinkle the raisins with water. For every 1 cup (250 ml) of raisins used, pour 1 Tbsp (15 ml) of water over the dried fruit. [1] X Research source Spread the water out as evenly as possible."

      "title": "Microwave for 30 to 60 seconds.",
      "content": "Microwave for 30 to 60 seconds. Cover the dish and microwave the raisins on high until the raisins appear to absorb the water. If the container has its own lid, verify that it is also microwave-safe before using it. For any dish that does not have its own microwave-safe lid, consider covering the container loosely with plastic wrap or a paper towel. Keep the dish slightly vented on one side to prevent pressure from building up inside. Note that the liquid will not be completely absorbed when you pull the dish out of the microwave. The raisins should begin to look plump, but the rest of the absorption will occur upon standing."

      "title": "Let stand.",
      "content": "Let stand. Stir the heated raisins and replace the cover. Let them stand out at room temperature for 2 to 3 minutes after that. If you would prefer the raisins to be somewhat dry, pat them gently with paper towels after they have had a chance to absorb the liquid and cool down."

      "content": "Combine the raisins and liquid in a saucepan. Place the raisins inside a small saucepan. Pour water into the saucepan as well, using just enough to completely cover the raisins. Water works well as a default option, but for something more flavorful, experiment with other liquids. For instance, consider trying grape juice, orange juice, or another fruit juice. For more mature palettes, consider a little diluted wine or rum. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Drain the raisins. Pour any excess liquid out of the pan or remove the raisins from the pan using a slotted spoon. Regardless of how you accomplish it, you simply need to remove the plumped raisins from the liquid. You could drain the liquid by pouring the contents of the pan through a small colander. Alternatively, place the lid on the pan, leaving a 1/4 inch (0.6 cm) gap between the pan and the lid on one side. Pour the liquid out through this gap, carefully preventing the raisins from slipping through. If you need the raisins to be somewhat dry after you plump them up, spread them out onto a couple layers of clean paper towels. The paper towels should absorb some of the excess liquid."

      "content": "Boil water. Fill a tea kettle with 1 cup (250 ml) or so of water and set it on your stove. Heat it on high until the water begins to boil. Water is the most common option used with this method, but you can experiment with other liquids for a more flavorful alternative. Grape juice enhances the raisins with their natural flavor, but other fruit juices, like orange juice or apple juice, can add greater depth and complexity. Alcohol, like wine or rum, could also be used. Instead of a traditional kettle, you could heat the water with an electric kettle or small saucepan, if preferred."

This method is referred to as a “cold soak” simply because no heat is used. Note that you must use some form of alcohol for this method if you want it to be as effective as possible. Wine is not the only alcoholic option you could use, though. For something a little less sweet, consider using rum, instead."
