      "title": "Purchase a repair kit if you want to easily fix your deck.",
      "content": "Purchase a repair kit if you want to easily fix your deck. To fix deck issues including minor scratches, splits, or chips, use a repair kit from a home supply store. Choose a repair kit with wax applicator sticks. In addition, you can purchase repair kits with scratch pads if you need to repair deep scratches. Choose the wax that most closely matches the color of your Trex decking."

      "title": "Sand the scratch with a scratch repair pad or applicator tool.",
      "content": "Sand the scratch with a scratch repair pad or applicator tool. Apply light pressure to either the scratch pad or the applicator that came with the wax, and move the tool over the scratched spot very quickly. Use a back and forth motion for best results. Continue sanding until the scratch is the same level as the rest of the board. [1] X Research source If your scratch or chip is more than 1 ⁄ 4 in (0.64 cm) deep, consider replacing the board."

      "title": "Apply wax to the damaged area until it is level.",
      "content": "Apply wax to the damaged area until it is level. Take off the tip of the wax stick, and rub it over the sanded area. Apply a thin, even layer over all of the scratches. Wax easily fills in small problem areas. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Rub the applicator over the wax to remove any excess.",
      "content": "Rub the applicator over the wax to remove any excess. Hold the applicator in between your index finger and thumb, and lightly move it back and forth across the wax. This scrapes off any extra wax. [3] X Research source Avoid pressing too hard on the applicator, or you’ll remove wax from the scratch."

      "title": "Purchase a replacement board from a Trex manufacturer or supplier.",
      "content": "Purchase a replacement board from a Trex manufacturer or supplier. Many home supply stores sell Trex decking, and you can also buy it directly from the manufacturer. Ensure your new board matches the size and color of your existing decking. You can search online to find a Trex manufacturer near you."

      "title": "Use a pencil to mark the board in 3 equal intervals.",
      "content": "Use a pencil to mark the board in 3 equal intervals. Look at your board, and divide it vertically into approximately 3 equal parts. Draw a vertical line running the length of the board so it's divided in thirds. [4] X Research source This way, you can easily separate your board."

      "title": "Make 2 parallel cuts with a hand saw to remove the center of the board.",
      "content": "Make 2 parallel cuts with a hand saw to remove the center of the board. Use a circular hand saw to easily make your cuts. Position the saw at the start of 1 of your lines, and make a straight cut down the board following the line. Then, do the same thing for your other line. [5] X Research source Make your cuts as straight as possible so the lines are parallel. Keep your fingers away from the blade at all times to prevent injury. Wear safety goggles to protect your eyes."

      "content": "Remove the center piece of wood from the rest of the board. Using your hands, lift up on the board from 1 side, and take it out of its spot. Place the board down on the neck next to you. [6] X Research source The board should easily come out from the rest with minimal force."

      "title": "Take out the other 2 remaining side pieces of the board from the tabs.",
      "content": "Take out the other 2 remaining side pieces of the board from the tabs. Once you remove the piece in the center, pick up the other 2 pieces of the board. The boards are secured by small, metal tabs underneath. To remove the boards, simply lift up on them so they separate from the tabs. Place them all next to each other out of the way until you can dispose of them. [7] X Research source Throw your Trex pieces away when it is trash night. To protect your hands, wear safety gloves as you do this. That way, they cannot get scraped."

      "title": "Hammer the tabs on the sides so the screw heads only show on 1 side.",
      "content": "Hammer the tabs on the sides so the screw heads only show on 1 side. There are several small metal tabs that held the old board in place. After the old board is out of the way, use a hammer to push the metal tabs downward. Hit the tabs with moderate force about 3-5 times until they are flush with the board next to it. This gets the tabs out of the way, so you can easily fit the new board in place. [8] X Research source If you are having trouble, use more force as you hit the tabs."

To secure the board into its spot, put the tip if the pry bar in between the new board and the board next to it, and pull back on the pry bar with light pressure.

Then, place a screw at a 45-degree angle at the side of the board. Use a drill to secure the nail in place. Drill 1 nail into the left and right side at both the top and bottom. [11] X Research source This screws secure the board in place."
