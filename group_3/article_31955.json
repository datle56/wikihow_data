[2] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Omit any time that you must use the Internet strictly for work, business, or school. Make a list of all of the other obligations you have and desired uses of your time, such as sleeping, time spent with friends and/or family, exercise, commuting, working or studying, etc. Determine how much time per week you would ideally devote to these needs. Consider how much time you have left per week, how much time you want to set aside for relaxing or personal use. From the remaining time, set aside an appropriate number of hours for personal Internet use. You can then apply this information to other methods to cut back on the time you spend online. Set a timer on your phone so you only stay plugged in for a specific amount of time."
