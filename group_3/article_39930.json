      "content": "Get a gum lift or lip repositioning surgery. Both of these procedures can be done by dentists or oral surgeons. In a gum lift, they will remove a portion of the gum around your tooth and place the gum line higher. In a lip repositioning, the surgeon will make 2 incisions in the gums under your lip. They’ll add a small band of tissue to keep your lip in place so it sits lower on your gum line. [10] X Research source Since these procedures are cosmetic, they usually aren’t covered by insurance. You can check with your provider to see how much either one will cost you."
