      "content": "Determine if it is a rare or valuable record. It’s very important to know if your record is an uncommon find which means it will be worth more money. Look for rock and roll and R&B 45s and EPs with original sleeves, or first pressings of albums. [2] X Research source Rock and roll and R&B 45s with picture sleeves that were pressed in the 1950’s have a value of at least $10, with many being valued at more than $100. [3] X Research source EPs were only made in the 50’s and 60’s. Rock and roll and R&B 45s with the cardboard sleeves are worth at least $20, with many being worth more than $200. First pressings of albums have more value than second, third, or subsequent pressings. They are referred to as the “originals” that were purchased when the record first hit the charts. Pressings after the first can usually be identified by differences in the cover or the color of the label."

      "content": "Identify the condition of the record. The condition of records are commonly determined by the Goldmine Standard. It ranges from very mint on the high end, to fair on the low end. The condition is judged on play grading and visual grading. There are professionals, both online and in music stores, who can assist in helping you grade the condition of your records if you’re not experienced. When determining the play grade of the record, listen to the record in its entirety, listening for needle wear, scratches, bubbles, or other defects in the vinyl. Use a lumen light source, such as natural sunlight or halogen lamps, to look for any visible defects to both the vinyl and sleeve. Avoid selling used copies with missing sleeves, that are noisy or scratched when played, or that have writing or tape on the sleeve or label. [4] X Research source"

When searching for an appraiser or collector, look for someone who is certified by the American Society of Appraisers, the Appraisers Association of America, or the International Society of Appraisers. Appraisers charge either a flat rate or an hourly rate of anywhere from $200 to $400 based on their expertise. Upon completion, they will provide you with a written report detailing the records, the procedure used to value it, and it’s current value. [8] X Trustworthy Source Consumer Reports Nonprofit organization dedicated to consumer advocacy and product testing Go to source To guarantee a fair price assessment, seek the opinion of an appraiser before taking an item to a local antique store or dealer. The appraiser has no conflict of interest since they are ethically unable to make an offer for purchase after appraising an item. Avoid an appraiser or collector who asks for a percentage of the item’s value versus an hourly rate or flat fee."

You can choose to sell each record individually, or as a collection. Some postings are free, while others will require a fee. Craigslist is probably the easiest and fastest way to sell your records. The ad is free, and you will typically get local responders within the same week. Craigslist allows some room for bargaining and trading. eBay allows you to list items in an auction style posting or for a “buy it now” price. It is free to post but additional posting features require fees. [9] X Research source The Goldmine site allows you to post a free ad to sell all items at once to a single record dealer who utilizes the site as well. The site also allows single ad postings.
