Number of players: 2+ What you need (besides weed): a cup or glass, paper, a rubber band to hold the paper in place, a penny Pace/Vibe: Can be fairly relaxed, and you're just passing a joint the whole time so it's not likely anybody's going to overdo it"

It's really easy to get too high if you're trying to play one of these games with edibles because the effects of edibles are so delayed. While dabs aren't delayed, they're also far too potent for most smokers to regularly consume over the course of a game. [2] X Research source This is similar to drinking games, which are usually played with beer instead of shots of liquor. The other nice thing about smoking flower is that you feel the effects almost immediately—making it a lot more difficult for you to overdo it. Stick to flower over vaping, which studies show can produce stronger side effects, especially for beginning or infrequent users.

If you're just supposed to take a hit, make it a small one, and you'll be less likely to find yourself getting too high too fast. If you have a small one-hitter pipe, that's often the best thing to use for smoking games. That way you have complete control over how much you're smoking."

It can be tempting to take extra hits during breaks or downtime, but that's also a great way to get way too high too fast."

The good thing is that the peak effects of THC are pretty short-lived, so the sooner you stop smoking, the sooner you'll start to come down. [6] X Research source Since second-hand smoke also contains low levels of THC, it's best to remove yourself completely from the area where people are smoking to ensure that you're not continually exposed.

As you walk, stay in the present and closely observe everything around you. [8] X Research source A walk in nature or a park is usually the best option—just make sure you're not driving to get there!

It can also help your body process the weed a little more quickly so you can start coming down and feeling more like yourself again. [10] X Research source Avoid drinking coffee, alcohol, or sodas, which could dehydrate you more and make your symptoms worse. Water can also help decrease nausea, which is a common side effect of consuming too much cannabis. [11] X Research source"

      "content": "Try chewing a few black peppercorns. There's a terpene in black pepper that's also found in THC, but this particular terpene increases the sedative effect and takes the edge off of your paranoia. If you're having an uncomfortable high marked by paranoia and anxiety, chewing on a couple of peppercorns could help. [12] X Research source The effect is fairly instantaneous, so you don't need much. If you only have ground pepper, you can sniff the aroma for a similar effect—just be careful not to actually inhale the ground pepper in the process.

If you're feeling anxious or paranoid, though, that might be easier said than done. If you can't fall asleep, a calming, focused activity can help you relax and ride out the high.
