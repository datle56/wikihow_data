      "content": "Walk around for a few minutes every hour. Avoid sitting or standing in the same place for an extended period of time since it can cause fluid to pool inside your body and increase your swelling. Get up to stretch your legs and take a brief walk for 3–4 minutes at least once an hour if you’re able to. As long as you move around frequently, your edema will look less inflamed and feel less painful.

      "content": "Elevate the swollen area above your heart for 30 minutes at a time. Lie on your back if you can so it’s easier to raise the swollen area higher than your heart. Prop up the area where you have edema with pillows or a cushion so blood and fluids drain away from it. If possible, keep the swollen area elevated for around 30 minutes about 3–4 times daily. [4] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source If you’re experiencing edema in your arms or hands, raise them straight above your head for about 1–2 minutes at a time to help drain the fluid.
