Slide the spindle out of the grooves it is resting in, by lifting it upward and to the rear of the dispenser. [1] X Research source Smaller tape dispensers may not have a spindle. You should see a plastic core (or roller) with the empty cardboard tape roll surrounding it; remove both of these from the dispenser."

The sticky side of the tape will be facing down, toward the floor. (If you are holding it the wrong way, the tape will extend away from you, as it pulls from the underside of the roll; the sticky side of the tape strip will be facing upwards, toward the ceiling.)"

The sticky surface of the tape should be facing down. Some dispensers do not have a safety shield. In this case, just thread the tape around the spinner with the tape strip leading over the top of the roll; the sticky side of the tape should be on the underside of the tape strip."

      "content": "Test the dispenser. Test that the tape is loaded correctly and the tensioner adjusted appropriately. #*Get a large box, and hold the open edges of the box closed on top. Hold the dispenser handle, and apply the tape to the far side of a package, right at the seam where the open edges of the box join together. The sharp cutting edge should be facing away from you. It will look as if you are holding a “tape gun.” The tape should stick itself to the surface of the box. If it doesn't, you may need to pull the tape strip out a little and stick the end of the tape to the box manually. Press the dispenser firmly down against the surface of the box, while pulling the whole unit across the top of the box. Pull the tape over the edge of the box that is closest to you, and tear the tape off using the sharp cutting edge on the dispenser. Adhere the edge of the tape to the box manually, if needed."
