[1] X Expert Source Deanna Ranlett Pottery & Ceramics Professional Expert Interview. 12 November 2021. The pieces of canvas will prevent the clay from sticking to the table or getting marked by the surface or roller. [2] X Research source Make sure the canvas covers the entire piece of clay and that there is some extra canvas in front of the clay. This will prevent the canvas from slipping off during the rolling process."

Before you use the slab roller, make sure that the clay slab is no more than three or four times thicker than the desired result. If the clay is too thick, it will not fit under the roller. To compress the clay slightly, you can use a rolling pin or your hand. [4] X Research source Remember to roll the clay down incrementally. Don't take giant steps, or you may damage your slab roller.

Then, spin the large wheel on the side of the table to move the roller over the clay. [7] X Research source You can turn the wheel back and forth so that the roller moves over the clay in both directions. This will help to create an even slab."

If you don't own a slab roller, you can roll out your slab with a wide rolling pin. A wide rolling pin will help to ensure that you create a slab with a consistent thickness. You want your slab to be no less than a 1 ⁄ 4 inch (6.4 mm) thick so that it is sturdy enough to use without breaking. [12] X Research source If your rolling pin is too thin, you may end up with ridges in the middle of the clay. It should be wide enough to fit across the entire slab of clay."

The rolling pin will lay across the sticks which will cause the clay to roll out to the exact thickness of the sticks.

If you don't have a template, or feel that you can cut the clay evenly without the use of a template, then simply draw the shape directly onto the clay. This can be done freehand. Then, cut out the shape using a pin tool. For example, you may not need a pattern if you are creating something using a simple square or rectangle. Freehand patterns will also allow you to create unique, one-of-a-kind pieces."

      "content": "Wait for the clay to be firm but malleable. Before you begin molding your clay, you want it to be firm enough so that it can support itself while still being moldable. Typically this is described as leather hard. You can work with clay that is softer than this, but you need to be extra careful because it can break easily. The length of time it takes for clay to dry will vary depending on your location and climate. If you live in a humid environment the clay will take longer to dry than an arid climate. [17] X Research source Check the clay regularly because it could take over a day to dry."

That way when you attach them they will fit together almost seamlessly. Using a pin tool rough up the edges of the clay where you wish to attach it to another piece of clay. You'll be basically carving shallow scratches into the clay. For example, if you are making a mug, you can begin with a rectangular slab of clay. Taper the two short edges of the rectangle. Then curve the rectangle and attach the two ends together so that you have a cylinder shape."
