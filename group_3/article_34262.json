Before you even start thinking about preventing a potential rape, you have to understand that if you are raped, it is 100% the rapist's fault and that nothing you did, wore, or said could have caused you to be raped. There is no such thing as \"asking for it,\" and anyone who leads you to believe otherwise is deeply misguided. Though you can certainly take measures to improve your chances of avoiding danger and staying safe, in the end, nothing you can do can \"cause\" you to be raped."

      "content": "Understand that the best thing that can be done to prevent rape is to prevent people from raping. In today's culture, there are many things that can be done to prevent rape, and it starts with the way women are perceived. If we work, as a society, to raise people who are respectful of others and stop contributing to a culture that objectifies and belittles vulnerable groups and women constantly, then we can slowly start to turn things around. Sometimes, adolescent boys think \"rape jokes\" are funny and that it's okay to joke around about sexual assault, and it's important to let them know that this is not the case. Any gender can be raped, but society has taken into itself that men \"can't possibly be raped\", and so most men are ashamed and afraid if they speak out. Many people feel that giving people guidelines about things that can be done to stay safe actually shames them and makes them feel like avoiding rape is all about having people act \"the right way,\" and that if they make a misstep, it is basically their fault that they got raped. This is not the intention of this article. This article intends to empower people by giving them some sensible advice on how to avoid danger. However, women are not the only gender to be raped. Men can be raped, but it just isn't as prevalent. Society doesn't believe \"petite little women\" can rape \"big strong men\", and yet it still happens."

This means that it's far more likely for a person to get raped by someone they know instead of a stranger in a dark alley. Therefore, while it's important to take precautions when you're alone, you shouldn't completely let your guard down when you're with people you know. When you're in a social situation with someone you know, be extra careful and don't fully let your guard down unless you feel truly safe with the person. Even then, rape can occur. Know that if your gut tells you the situation is not okay, you should leave as soon and as safely as you can.

Their decision to rape is based on how easily they perceive their target can be intimidated. Rapists are looking for available and vulnerable targets.
