If you’re not happy with the results, simply repeat the process until your sweatpants have shrunk to your desired size. If you don't want your sweatpants to shrink too much, check on them periodically as they're drying. Once they're small enough, you can let them air dry or lower the heat setting on the dryer so they finish drying but don't shrink any more.
