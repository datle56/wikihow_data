      "content": "Remove the source of the swelling if it’s due to an adverse reaction. If you wear a hearing aid, earplugs, or earrings, the swelling in or on your ear may be caused by an adverse reaction. To start to reduce the swelling, you’ll first want to remove the potential source of the reaction from your ear. [1] X Research source This will prevent the reaction from getting worse and should make the swelling start to go down. Adverse reactions that cause ear swelling include sensitivity due to a new piercing, as well as allergic reactions caused by jewelry, earplugs, or hearing aids. Avoid inserting anything directly in your ear, such as a cotton swab, since you could rupture your eardrum."

If your ear swelling doesn’t start to go down within 48 to 72 hours of starting the antibiotics, contact your doctor. In some cases, your doctor may be able to determine that the swelling is due to a bacterial infection, but they may not know the exact cause. Therefore, they may want to switch your prescription to try to a different antibiotic. If your doctor prescribes antibiotics to help reduce ear swelling due to a bacterial infection, it is important that you take all of the medication as directed even if the swelling goes down.
