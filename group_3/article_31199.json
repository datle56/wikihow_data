Make sure to keep the product under one radical sign. [2] X Research source For example, if you are calculating 15 × 5 {\\displaystyle {\\sqrt {15}}\\times {\\sqrt {5}}} , you would calculate 15 × 5 = 75 {\\displaystyle 15\\times 5=75} .

[3] X Research source If you cannot factor out a perfect square, your answer is already simplified and you need not do anything further. A perfect square is the result of multiplying an integer (a positive or negative whole number) by itself. [4] X Research source For example, 25 is a perfect square, because 5 × 5 = 25 {\\displaystyle 5\\times 5=25} . For example, 75 {\\displaystyle {\\sqrt {75}}} can be factored to pull out the perfect square 25: 75 {\\displaystyle {\\sqrt {75}}} = 25 × 3 {\\displaystyle {\\sqrt {25\\times 3}}} Academic tutor David Jia’s biggest tip for solving square root problems is to remember that “square roots are simply the opposite of squaring. For example, 4 squared is 16. Therefore, the square root of 16 is 4.”"

Squaring a number and taking the square root of a number are opposite operations; thus, they undo each other. The result of squaring a square root, then, is simply the number under the radical sign. [5] X Research source For example, 25 × 25 = 25 {\\displaystyle {\\sqrt {25}}\\times {\\sqrt {25}}=25} . You get that result because 25 × 25 = 5 × 5 = 25 {\\displaystyle {\\sqrt {25}}\\times {\\sqrt {25}}=5\\times 5=25} ."

[6] X Research source To multiply the coefficients, just ignore the radical sign and radicand, and multiply the two whole numbers. Place their product in front of the first radical sign. Pay attention to positive and negative signs when multiplying coefficients. Don't forget that a negative times a positive is a negative, and a negative times a negative is a positive. For example, if you are calculating 3 2 × 2 6 {\\displaystyle 3{\\sqrt {2}}\\times 2{\\sqrt {6}}} , you would first calculate 3 × 2 = 6 {\\displaystyle 3\\times 2=6} . So now your problem is 6 2 × 6 {\\displaystyle 6{\\sqrt {2}}\\times {\\sqrt {6}}} ."
