One way to allow followers to choose whether they want to see something or not is to create a slideshow-type post , with the first image(s) in the post displaying the spoiler or warning image you create. Then, viewers can decide whether they want to swipe left to see the sensitive content. You can also post your sensitive content warning image on your story to warn people that upcoming images or videos might be upsetting. Keep in mind that even if you're sharing content behind a warning, you'll still need to abide by Instagram's community guidelines ."
