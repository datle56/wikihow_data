      "content": "Leave the bag outside to air it out. Sometimes, a good airing out is all a bag needs to make it smell better . Certified leather care technician Mallika Sharma recommends deodorizing leather and other types of bags, by opening them up and leaving them outside in the sun for a few hours. If needed, repeat the process over a few more days until the odor is gone. Sharma says not to leave the bag in direct sunlight for “more than a few hours as sunlight can cause the leather,” and other materials, “to fade.” Pick a sunny and dry day to air out the bag so it doesn’t get rained on or absorb excess moisture. Alternatively, leave the bag on a covered porch or in your garage with the door open for a similar effect. Remember to bring the bag back inside to really test the smell. You might not fully smell odors outside."

      "content": "Wipe the inside of the bag with a vinegar solution to remove smells. Make a 1:1 solution of warm water and white vinegar. Then, add a drop of dish soap and stir it to make some suds. Dip a clean sponge or rag into the mixture and squeeze it out so it’s damp, not soaking wet. Then, scrub the inside of the bag, rewetting the sponge or rag as needed. [1] X Research source When you’re done cleaning, keep the bag open and set it in a well-ventilated area to dry. To speed up drying, turn on a fan or open any nearby doors or windows. Remember that the sponge shouldn’t be soaked, as this can potentially damage your bag’s material. Instead, make sure it’s only damp. If you aren’t sure what type of material the bag is made of, put a small dab of this solution in a hidden spot and let it sit for a few minutes. If you don’t see any discoloration or damage, then it should be safe for the rest of the bag. As an alternative , pour white vinegar into a spray bottle and lightly spritz the inside of the bag. House cleaning specialist Laura Smith also recommends spritzing the inside of the bag with rubbing alcohol to remove odors."

      "content": "Sprinkle household baking soda into the bag to absorb leftover odors. Smith says that “baking soda is a natural odor absorber” that can neutralize odors inside your totes, purses, and gym bags. She recommends pouring “baking soda in a sock” and sealing it inside the bag “for a couple of days.” Or, sprinkle some baking soda directly into the bag or pour it into an open container or plastic bag. Just close the bag and give the baking soda a few days to absorb the odors. Alternatively, use a baking soda pod designed for refrigerators. This keeps the baking soda contained so you don’t have to worry about making a mess with it."

      "content": "Place activated charcoal packs inside the bag to neutralize odors. Charcoal is another item that absorbs and neutralizes odors. Simply place 1 or 2 activated charcoal packs inside your gym bag, purse, or lunch box. Or, pour powdered or crushed charcoal into a sock or linen bag and set it in the bag. Then, close up the bag and leave the charcoal inside for 1 day. [2] X Research source Smell the bag after 1 day. If it still smells, replace the charcoal with fresh pieces and close up the bag for another 24 hours."

      "content": "Leave kitty litter inside the bag for 1 week to absorb bad smells. Kitty litter contains deodorizing elements and works similarly to baking soda and charcoal. Simply pour some litter into a cup, open plastic container, or sock and leave it in the bag. Seal the bag up and let the kitty litter absorb the odor for up to 1 week. [3] X Research source Place the bag somewhere it won't get knocked over. If the kitty litter spills out, simply vacuum it up with a hose attachment."

      "content": "Use dry coffee grounds for a potpourri effect. Coffee grounds can absorb the bad odors and also provide a pleasant aroma to cover any remaining smells. Just take a coffee filter and fill it halfway with dry coffee grounds. Twist the top, seal it with a rubber band, and place it inside the bag. Then, close the bag and leave it overnight to see if the smell improves. [4] X Research source If the smell improves but isn’t all the way gone, replace the old coffee with fresh grounds and leave the bag for another day. Just repeat until the odor is gone. If you like the smell, leave the coffee grounds in the bag for a continuous effect. Simply put the filter in a safe place where it won’t break open. Try different coffee flavors, like French vanilla or hazelnut, for an even stronger effect."

      "content": "Keep silica gel packets inside the bag to absorb odors. Silica gel packets are made to absorb excess moisture and unpleasant musty smells. Simply open your purse, gym bag, lunch box, or tote and add a handful of silica gel packets. Then, close the bag and use it as normal. [5] X Research source Replace the silica gel packets with fresh ones whenever you notice that they are saturated with moisture. Sharma recommends that you “always put a pouch of silica gel inside” your bag to help “keep moisture at bay,” as moisture can cause unpleasant odors and mold growth."

      "content": "Leave a dryer sheet or potpourri sachet in the bag to mask smells. If cleaning and deodorizing didn’t remove the smells completely, leaving a pleasant-smelling item inside the bag at all times can help mask any remaining odors. For example, place a dryer sheet, cotton ball soaked in essential oils, tea bag, paper strip sprayed with perfume, or potpourri sachet in the bottom of the bag. [6] X Research source Take out the old sheet or sachet and add a new one when the fresh smell starts to fade."

      "content": "Apply a store-bought deodorizing spray if the smell remains. Open the bag up and spray a commercial odor eliminator, like unscented Febreze or Lysol , inside. Keep the bag open and let it air out. Once the spray dries, check to see if the odor is gone. [7] X Research source Feel free to use a scented product, if you prefer. Only spray the interior of the bag with the deodorizer. It might leave a stain or mark on the exterior of the bag, especially if it’s leather."

      "content": "Check the care tag to see if the bag is machine-washable. Some bags, especially gym bags, backpacks, and totes made of nylon , polyester, or canvas, are machine-washable. Simply check the care label for text saying “Machine Wash” or a symbol showing a bucket of water. Both signs indicate that you can put this item in the washing machine. [8] X Research source Most gym bags, backpacks, and totes are machine-washable, but always check the label to confirm. Handbags usually aren’t machine-washable. Washing tags may also have a symbol showing a bucket of water with a hand. This means handwash only. A bucket of water with an “X” over it means do not wash. These items are dry-clean only."

      "content": "Shake the bag out to remove any dirt and debris. Before placing the bag in the machine, empty out all of the contents inside it. Then, turn the bag upside down over a garbage can and shake it to clear leftover dirt and debris. [9] X Research source This may also remove any debris that were causing the odor. If the inside of the bag is very dirty , use a handheld vacuum or hose attachment to clean it out before washing it."

      "title": "Put the bag in the washing machine and run it through a gentle cycle.",
      "content": "Put the bag in the washing machine and run it through a gentle cycle. Wash the bag by itself, not with a load of laundry. Close any zippers first so they don’t get caught. Then, pour normal (non-bleach) detergent into the machine and set it to a gentle or delicate wash cycle with warm water. [10] X Research source Make sure to remove any attachments, like detachable straps, before putting the bag in the washing machine. You can wash these attachments separately if you want to. If you can’t remove the attachments, place the bag inside a mesh laundry bag or pillowcase. This helps protect any straps or other accessories from damage. If the bag has a logo, design, or embellishments on the outside, turn it inside out before washing it. This helps protect the exterior from fading or damage."

      "content": "Add 1 ⁄ 2 cup (120 mL) of white vinegar to the rinse cycle to kill the odor. White vinegar has odor-fighting properties that can help lift unpleasant smells from your bag. When the machine reaches its rinse cycle, pour 1 ⁄ 2 cup (120 mL) of vinegar into the fabric softener compartment or directly into the drum to remove any lingering odors. [11] X Research source This is optional since normal detergent might get rid of all the odor."

      "title": "Air-dry the bag completely before using it to prevent musty smells.",
      "content": "Air-dry the bag completely before using it to prevent musty smells. Most bags aren’t dryer-safe. Instead, blot any excess moisture with a towel and reshape the bag. Then, leave it in a well-ventilated area to dry. Either open the bag and place it on a clean towel or hang it upside down on a clothes drying rack or laundry line. This helps ensure that no musty smells develop. [12] X Research source For instance, leave the bag to dry in a room with a fan or open windows. If it’s nice outside, let the bag dry in a spot out of direct sunlight. To speed up the dry time, place a standing fan in front of the bag."

      "title": "Clean your bag whenever it’s dirty, or every 1 to 3 months.",
      "content": "Clean your bag whenever it’s dirty, or every 1 to 3 months. Regularly cleaning your bag is one of the best ways to keep it from accumulating odors. How often you clean it depends on how often you use it and what you use it for. For instance, you might need to clean out your gym bag once per month but your weekend tote bag every 3 months. [13] X Research source If your bag is machine washable, throw it in the laundry on a gentle cycle with a bit of detergent. If it isn’t machine washable, wipe out the inside with a 1:1 solution of warm water and white vinegar and a bit of dish soap. Residential cleaning specialist Regina DeCorte also recommends cleaning out the inside lining of your bag with “a dampened microfiber cloth, baking soda, and a drop of liquid dish detergent.” Simply “apply the dampened cloth to the interior lining, focusing on any stains.” Then, set it “on a sunny window sill to dry.” Clean up dirt and spills as soon as you notice them to prevent odors from forming."

      "content": "Keep your bag in a cool, dry place. When you’re back home from work, school, the gym, or running errands, Sharma recommends that you open up your bag and “store [it] in a cool and dry place.” This helps air out the bag, preventing any odors or moisture from accumulating inside. For instance, keep your bag in your bedroom or closet. Or, hang it up on a coat hook or tree in your entryway. Avoid storing your bag near areas that get warm and moist, such as your kitchen or bathroom."

      "content": "Store your bag in a dust bag when you’re not using it. To prevent dirt, dust, and other debris from getting on or inside your bag in long-term storage, Sharma recommends placing it inside a “dust cover” or “cloth bag.” These breathable bags also prevent your bag from absorbing moisture, which can lead to odors or mold growth. For extra protection, place silica gel packets inside your bag to help absorb moisture and odors in storage."
