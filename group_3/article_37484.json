From time to time, you might want to open up your bottle of correction fluid, and wipe the neck part, right where the threads are. Soak a folded paper towel with some nail polish remover and wipe it around the neck. This will remove any excess ink that might have dried up on the neck of the bottle. It will help keep the cap tightly closed and prevent any air from getting inside."
