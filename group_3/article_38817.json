      "content": "Pray to God. You don’t have to be in a church or on your knees to pray; you can just talk to God as a form of prayer. You can find specific prayers for almost any situation in your life, or you can simply ask God to help you with you a problem. You can pray for guidance, peace, or any number of things that are on your mind. [2] X Research source Prayer is a way of serving God that can be beneficial to you by letting your faith guide you as you learn to focus on what’s happening in your life and address any issues. Prayer is not a way to ignore what’s happening in your life, nor should it be used as a means to ask God for things, as He’s not a genie who grants wishes. For a simple method of prayer, use ACTS— adoration, contrition, thanksgiving, and supplication to guide your prayer. Adore God for the magnificence of who He is and what He has freely given. Humble yourself through contrition by acknowledging your smallness, mistakes, and transgressions. Express thanksgiving for all He has given. Finally, supplicate to God and ask Him, if it is His will, to continue supplying what is needed– to you or to others. Serving God through prayer is sort of the first step on the path to serving God throughout your whole life and through your faith in Him."

      "content": "Get strength from God. There’s a proverb about a single pair of footprints in the sand during the worst points in your life. And the message of the proverb is that when you thought you were on your own during those hardest parts of your life, God carried you through. Serving God can come from letting him give you strength when you need it most by simply putting your faith in him. Getting strength from God isn't always the easiest concept. After all, how is God going to make you physically stronger? He won't, but you can use your faith in him to find strength in your daily life. Maybe you are quick to anger. When you feel your blood beginning to boil, take a moment and just pray to God for peace. Ask to find the strength to stay calm and let things roll off your back. Taking a minute to just breathe and pray can help you calm down. Perhaps you are having a difficult time coping with something in your life; by praying for strength, you may find that you have the ability to cope better. Getting strength from God will a lot of the time come down to faith and the knowledge that you are never walking alone, that He is there to pick you up if you fall."
