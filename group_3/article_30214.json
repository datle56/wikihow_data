      "content": "Buy fabric. Traditional togas were made with wool fabric, but you can use cotton to make a good looking toga as well. Roman togas were typically almost white, but children, politicians and important people wore bright white togas with purple accents. You need a large amount of fabric to use for making an authentic Roman toga. Buy a piece of fabric that is four to six yards long. Four yards is a good length to make a child’s toga and six yards is recommended to make an adult male’s toga."
