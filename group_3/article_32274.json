      "content": "Get a plain t-shirt and wash to remove any shrinking. Even if the label on your shirt says \"pre-shrunk,\" it would still be a good idea to wash it. This will remove any potential starch or stiffener that might prevent the paint from sticking properly."

      "content": "Set up your work area. Spread some newspaper on a table, and get anything that might get ruined out of the way. It might also be a good idea to have some paper towels (for blotting) and a cup of water (for rinsing the paintbrush) handy as well."

    {
      "title": "Place a piece of cardboard inside the T-shirt.",
      "content": "Place a piece of cardboard inside the T-shirt. The cardboard should be about the same size as the shirt. You want it to slip inside the shirt easily without stretching it. This will prevent the paint from bleeding onto the back of the shirt. You can also use a folded up newspaper for this. Even an old magazine or catalogue will do in a pinch."

      "title": "Paint your design using fabric paint.",
      "content": "Paint your design using fabric paint. If you are nervous about free-handing the design, you can always trace your design first using a stencil and a permanent marker, and then fill it in. Consider using a few paintbrushes in different shapes and sizes; a flat brush will give you some nice, crisp edges while a pointy brush is great for detail. If you want your design to have multiple colors, such as a smiles face, do the background color first. Let the paint dry, then do the details. Try to get paint brushes meant for painting fabric. They usually have stiffer bristles made from taklon. Avoid natural brushes, such as camel hair, as they will be too soft to hold the thick paint and create nice designs."

      "title": "Let the paint dry.",
      "content": "Let the paint dry. If you'd like, you can speed up the drying process by blowing the paint with a hair dryer. Do not remove the cardboard inside the shirt until the paint is completely dry. Once the paint dries, you can flip it around and paint the back as well. Keep the cardboard inside the shirt and let the paint dry."

    {
      "title": "Remove the cardboard.",
      "content": "Remove the cardboard. If the paint is sticking to the cardboard, don't panic. Simply wiggle your finger between the shirt and the cardboard to pry it apart. Discard the cardboard when you are done, or save it for another project."

You can use a fabric painting stencil, a regular stencil, or you can make your own out of thin plastic, freezer paper, or cardstock. You can even use painter's tape to create geometric designs! Make sure that the stencil is laying flat against the shirt, or the paint will bleed under the edges. If you are using a stencil meant for painting fabric, it will likely have a sticky back. All you have to do is smooth it down. If you are using a regular stencil, or if you made your own, coat the back of the stencil with repositionable adhesive spray, then press the stencil down.

Cover your work area with lots of newspaper, and put on some old clothes or an apron. Lastly, consider putting on a pair of plastic gloves; spray painting can get messy.

Spray the paint on using a long, sweeping motion. Don't worry if the paint is not thick enough. You can always do another layer or two. Consider spraying the design using clear sealer first. This will give you better control over the paint and prevent it from soaking into the fabric. Be sure to let the sealer dry before applying the paint. [10] X Research source"
