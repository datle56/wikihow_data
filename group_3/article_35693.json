You can use https://www.speedtest.net to see your average upload speed. To make sure about your upload speeds, you can also go to https://testmy.net/upload , and select something around 6MB in the Manual Test Size section. This will upload random data that amounts up to the selected file size, and give you your constant upstream numbers, which live streams usually rely on. Usually, 1500kbps (1.5mbps) is the recommended minimum for a decent 720p stream at 30fps , and you need closer to 2mbps or higher for better streams at this quality."
