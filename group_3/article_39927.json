The process is super simple—just dilute vanilla essential oil in a carrier oil like jojoba oil , then rub the mixture into your pulse points on your body. A dab behind your ears, on your wrists, and on your inner elbows should leave you smelling delicious! [24] X Research source Here’s a more detailed breakdown of how to make it: Gather your materials. You’ll need a small rollerball bottle (to store your perfume oil in), vanilla essential oil, two pipettes or glass droppers , and a carrier oil (like jojoba oil or almond oil). You’ll want to follow a 20% to 80% ratio of essential oil to carrier oil. To do this, use one pipette to add 20 drops of vanilla essential oil to the dropper bottle, then use the other pipette to add 80 drops of carrier oil. Shake it up, and that’s it! You have vanilla perfume oil. [25] X Research source Note: Most vanilla essential oil will actually contain synthetic ingredients, since you can’t technically get pure “essential oil” from vanilla beans. [26] X Research source If you want something entirely natural, you can try using vanilla extract (but it may not last as long), or vanilla infusions (which can be a bit expensive)."

For example: [32] X Research source Perfume type & intensity: Eau de toilettes and body mists are a bit lighter, while eau de parfums are more intense. Other fragrance notes: Vanilla perfumes include a blend of other notes to create a unique scent. If you like simple, sweet vanilla fragrances, you’ll likely want something with notes of tonka bean, chocolate, or caramel. If you prefer something more complex and less obviously vanilla, you may want to look for something that includes musky, woodsy, spicy, or floral notes. Occasion & wearability: Vanilla is pretty much a universally-loved scent, so you should be good to wear it in most situations. However, some vanilla perfumes are pretty spicy and warm, which means they may feel more suited to the fall and winter months. Others contain tropical notes, so they feel more appropriate for summertime or daytime wear. Price: Eau de parfums tend to be the most expensive, while eau de toilettes are slightly less pricey. Body mists and body sprays are usually the least expensive option. [33] X Research source"
