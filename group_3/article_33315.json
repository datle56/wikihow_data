      "content": "Find a pickleball or badminton court to play a game. Pickleball and badminton courts have the same size measurements, but a pickleball court will have the net lowered to the ground so it’s at a height of 34 inches (86 cm). Search online for pickleball courts near you or find a gym that has badminton and pickleball courts that you can use to play a game. Pickleball courts can be located outside or indoors."

Pickleball can be played with 2 people competing against each other, which is known as singles play, or with 2 teams of 2 people playing against each other, which is called doubles play. Games of singles and doubles both use the same court, have the same number of faults before losing their serve, and are often played to 11 points. Doubles is the most popular way to play pickleball."

      "content": "Use 1 pickleball and have each player use a pickleball paddle. Pickleball specially designed paddles, which are smaller than tennis racquets, but larger than ping-pong paddles. Each player needs to have 1 paddle. You also need to use a pickleball, which is a lightweight ball with holes through it like a whiffle ball. There are a variety of colors you can choose for your pickleball."

      "content": "Stand behind the baseline of the right service court to start a game. A serve, which is the strike that starts a game or round of pickleball, is always performed from behind the baseline, which is the 20 ft (6.1 m) line at the end of each side of the court. When you’re starting a game of pickleball, stand behind the baseline on the right side of the court. [1] X Research source The 2 squares in front of the baseline are known as the right and left service courts. Once a game is in play, you’ll alternate which service court you stand behind to serve."

      "content": "Hit the pickleball with an underhand strike below waist level to serve it. Hold the pickleball at your side with 1 hand and hold your paddle steady with another. When you’re ready to serve, drop the pickleball and strike it with an underhand motion with your paddle. [2] X Research source If you hit the pickleball above waist level, or if the ball bounces off of the ground, then it’s a fault."

Avoid hitting the net with your serve, or hitting the pickleball past the opposing team’s baseline before it bounces off of the ground in the opposite service court. [3] X Research source For example, if you’re serving from behind your right service court, you must bounce the ball once on the opposing team’s right service court, which is diagonal across from you. If your serve hits the net or goes past the opposing team’s sideline or baseline before it bounces on the service court, then it’s a fault."

When you serve the pickleball and it bounces off of the opposing team’s service court, the ball is in play and is hit back and forth until a fault is committed, such as the ball going out of bounds, hitting the net, or bouncing more than once on the court. If the opposing team commits a fault when it’s your serve, then you score a point. Whenever you score a point, start your next serve from behind the other service court. [4] X Research source For instance, if you serve the pickleball from behind the right service court, and then the other team commits a fault and you score a point, your next serve will be from behind the left service court. Only the team that is serving can score a point!"

If it’s your serve and the opposing team commits a fault, then your team earns 1 point. If it’s your team’s serve and you commit a fault, then no points are awarded.
