      "content": "Restitch the unraveled area. If the original yarn is still attached, pull until you have a loose loop and then re-crochet the unraveled section. Take care to secure the yarn end when finished. If you run short of yarn by a stitch or two, use a tighter tension with a hook one size smaller."
