      "content": "Place your hands on the keyboard with your index fingers on F and J . Think of these two keys as your anchors. When your hands are at rest, your left index finger should always be on F , and your right index finger should always be on J . Most keyboards have a little bump or ridge on each of these keys to help you find them easily without looking. The row of keys with F and J is called the “home row.”"

      "content": "Raise your wrists a tiny bit above the keyboard. Ideally, your wrists should be straight when you’re using a keyboard, not bent up or down. If you’re typing on a flat keyboard, raise your wrists slightly so that the heels of your hands aren’t resting on the keyboard or desk. [1] X Research source The best option is to use a keyboard that’s slanted slightly downward from front to back, since this will help keep your wrists in a neutral position. If possible, keep the keyboard slightly below elbow level so your arms are slightly extended (not at a sharp 90º angle). This promotes better blood flow to your forearms and hands. It’s also best to sit in a chair that supports your lower back and allows you to lean back very slightly while keeping your spine straight."

However, it’s important to use the right fingers for each key to have the most comfortable and efficient typing experience. Aim to use the following fingers for each key: [2] X Research source Left hand: Use your pinkie finger to hit the following keys: ` , Tab , Caps Lock , Shift , Ctrl , 1 , Q , A , Z , and Alt (or Option ). Use your ring finger to hit 2 , W , S , X , and Command (on a Mac keyboard). Use your middle finger for 3 , E , D , and C . Use your index finger for 4 , 5 , R , T , F , G , V , and B .

      "content": "Move your hands to reach additional keys. While you can reach almost any key from your base position in the home row, you may need to move your hands to get to special keys like the F (function) keys at the top of your keyboard, the Esc key , the number pad (if your keyboard has one), and the arrow keys . The number pad and arrow keys are typically on the right side of the keyboard, while the F keys are at the top. Esc is usually at the top left. Some keyboards may have additional special keys like Print Screen , Insert , Scroll Lock , and so on. These keys are often located at the upper right side of the keyboard, near the number pad."

      "content": "Practice finding your keys without looking. Being able to type fast without looking at the keyboard, or touch typing , is an incredibly useful skill. Once you get used to putting your hands in the proper position on the keyboard, touch typing will become much easier. One of the best ways to learn is to practice with typing games or apps, which will help you get used to the layout of the keyboard and increase your typing speed . Websites like https://www.typing.com/ offer free lessons, games, and typing tests to help you improve your typing skills at your own pace."
