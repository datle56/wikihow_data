      "content": "Journal about the fear. Ask yourself whether or not you feel capable of creating your own happiness and to take care of yourself. Then, push yourself to think about what it is that others do for you that you are unable to do alone. Consider what about being alone creates fear for you. Answering questions like these in your journal can provide insight and clarity into your fear: How long has this fear been with you? What was going on when it started? How has it changed since then?"

      "content": "Consider your role in close relationships. People who fear being alone typically perceive their relationships as requiring lots of upkeep. Do you feel you must take care of or devote a large amount of time and energy to the other person? Try to be realistic about what others need from you by reflecting on their capability to provide for and take care of themselves. You can also think about others who are around to support them, or perhaps the fact that they were doing fine before you met. This tendency to give others the depth of love and attention that you want for yourself is problematic. This might be one way that you are robbed of the solitude needed to develop your own values and unique personality. In fact, this tendency ironically stops you from being able to direct focus outward onto others in a meaningful way. [3] X Research source"

For instance, you may decide that you will spend fifteen minutes alone without calling, texting, or messaging anyone, and as long as you need to process those fifteen minutes. This process might take place four times a week. Think about why you want to conquer your fear of being alone—like you're thinking of breaking up with your partner. This can help you determine what your goals should be. [4] X Expert Source Tracy Carver, PhD Licensed Psychologist Expert Interview. 7 January 2021. Make exposure gradual and take into consideration how bad your fear is. This process takes time and should not be rushed. Plan to be alone for short spurts. Little by little, you will want to plan increased amounts of time alone until you don’t feel overcome with panic. Try making an exposure hierarchy in which you rank feared situations on a scale of 0-100 according to how afraid you anticipate being when exposed to it. [5] X Research source For example, you may rank spending an hour alone at home at 100, but going to a movie alone a 70. By ranking you can work up to overcoming gradually greater fears only once fear subsides for the less threatening fears."

      "title": "Expose yourself to the fear.",
      "content": "Expose yourself to the fear. [6] X Research source Try exposing yourself to a lower-ranked fear. At first you’ll feel incredibly nervous and anxious, and this is normal. In time, your body will relax. After a few highly uncomfortable attempts, this will be a way to signal to yourself that you are capable of spending time alone. Exposing yourself to your fear will also help you think more deeply about the fears behind the initial panic. Don't become overly preoccupied with how panicked you feel and how stressed your body becomes. Because you are purposely exposing yourself to something you fear, shallow breathing, increased heart rate, and other physical symptoms of anxiety are normal. The longer the alone time, the greater the anxiety you will feel. But, with exposure, anxiety is expected and will dissipate with time. Gently push your limits until you are happy with how much alone time you can handle. Imagine you are going swimming--dipping your toes in the water can be exciting, but it won't adjust you to the temperature of the water.

During and after your exposure sessions, record your level of fear on a scale from 0 to 10. 0 is fully relaxed and 10 is as fearful as you can imagine being. Doing this will show you how desensitized you have become to being alone and how much fear you were safely able to handle. Note trends in the sessions when anxiety seems especially high or low. Do you see any other factors that affect your fear, like the weather, or who you spent time with earlier in the day? You can also use the journal to write encouraging thoughts, difficulties, and anything else that \"comes up\" related to the fear. This will help you know yourself and your underlying patterns better."

What is it that you need from time alone? Everyone needs time to reflect, embrace self-understanding, and grow from within. Consider how much you learn about yourself when making decisions that don’t need to be negotiated with anyone else. Do you already have a passion that can only be fostered when you have time alone to express yourself, work out the kinks of what you do, and create to the best of your ability? Consider solitude a gift that you are giving yourself to get your passion going."
