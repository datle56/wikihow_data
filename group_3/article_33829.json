      "title": "Stuffed Shoes",
      "content": "Stuffed Shoes Make someone think their feet grew overnight by stuffing the toes of their shoes with paper or cotton balls. If you stuff their shoes after they go to sleep at night, they’ll be groggy—and easier to prank—when they put their shoes on first thing in the morning. It will take them longer to figure out what’s going on. Try to hide out where your target puts on their shoes in the morning so you can witness them fall for your prank."

Try doing all of the appliances or everything in the refrigerator. Or, stick googly eyes on all of the family portraits for an even funnier prank.

      "content": "Whoopee Cushion Everyone loves a fart joke, so planting a whoopee cushion is the perfect prank for the whole family can enjoy. It’s also as easy as blowing up the cushion and then hiding it where the prankee usually sits. And it’s sure to have people giggling for the rest of the day. A whoopee cushion is a rubber cushion that makes a loud noise that sounds like a fart when you sit on it. [1] X Research source Whoopee cushions also come in different sizes to make them easier to hide in different spots."

      "title": "Spilled Beverage",
      "content": "Spilled Beverage This is a classic prank that’s pretty simple to play if you have a fake spilled cup . Just offer to get a soda or cup of coffee for someone. Then, place the fake spilled cup on the counter or floor and yell, “Oh no! I spilled it!” When the other person comes running in and notices the cup, pick it up to show them it’s fake. This prank calls for a little bit of acting, but nothing a kid couldn’t manage."

    {
      "title": "Spider on the Loose",
      "content": "Spider on the Loose This one is super easy. All you need is a cup or glass, a piece of paper, and something to write with. Balance the cup on its side on a table or countertop. Then, write a note that reads, “Don’t lift this! There’s a great big spider underneath.” Place the note next to the cup and just leave it there. To make it scarier, put a fake spider nearby."

      "title": "Green Milk",
      "content": "Green Milk This is a great prank to play on your mom or dad right around breakfast time. Just put a few drops of green food dye into a jug of milk. Then, screw the cap back on and gently shake the jug to mix in the dye and make the milk green. Then, tell your target you think something might be wrong with the milk. When they go to check the milk, say you think it’s moldy. This prank will work with a see-through jug, but it’s better if it’s opaque. That way, the person doesn’t see the milk’s color until they look inside or pour it out."

    {
      "title": "Frozen Cereal",
      "content": "Frozen Cereal Pour your target’s favorite cereal and some milk into a bowl. Stick a spoon in it and then put the whole thing in the freezer for the night. The next morning, take the bowl out and put it where your target sits at the table. When they try to eat it, the spoon will be stuck! [2] X Research source Don’t get the bowl out of the freezer too soon, or it might thaw out before your target tries to eat."

      "title": "Buggy Ice Cube",
      "content": "Buggy Ice Cube Drop a few small fake bugs into an ice cube tray. Fill the tray with water and pop it in the freezer to make ice cubes. Once the cubes are frozen, offer to get your target a drink. Put one of the “buggy” ice cubes in their drink and give it to them. The person you’re pranking might not notice the bug right away, but when they do, they’ll be grossed out. If they don’t notice the fake bug, wait until they take a drink and say something like, “Ew! What’s that in your glass!” Use hot water in the ice cube tray—with the help of an adult—to make the ice cubes clearer when they freeze. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Wobbly Juice",
      "content": "Wobbly Juice Make some jello in the same color as your target’s favorite juice or drink. Pour it into a clear glass and pop a straw into it. Then, place the glass in the refrigerator to let the jello set up. Once the jello is set, give the glass to your target and watch them try to take a drink. Jello takes 2-3 hours to set up, so make sure your target won’t be looking in the refrigerator for that length of time."

      "content": "Toothpaste Oreos Twist an Oreo cookie apart and scrape the cream off the pieces. Squeeze some plain, white toothpaste onto the cookie and then put the Oreo back together again. Swap the cream for toothpaste in one Oreo—or a few—and then put them back in the package. Wait for your cookie-loving target to get a snack and be confused and grossed out at the worst Oreo they’ve ever tasted!"

      "title": "Ghostly Messages",
      "content": "Ghostly Messages To play this spooky prank, mix a few drops of dish soap into a cup of water. Dip a cotton swab into the soapy water and use it to write a message on the bathroom mirror. Then, the next time someone takes a shower and the mirror fogs up, your “ghostly” message will appear. “I see you,” “Help me,” and “Get out” are all great spooky messages to use. The soapy water may take up to 30 minutes to dry, so plan to write it when no one will be using the bathroom for a while."

      "title": "Bubble Wrap Rug",
      "content": "Bubble Wrap Rug All you need is a piece of bubble wrap for this easy prank. Take a piece of the bubble wrap that’s slightly smaller than the bath mat or rug in your bathroom. Pick up the rug and place the bubble warp in its spot. Then, cover the bubble wrap with the rug and wait for someone to step on it! Save some bubble wrap from a package or get a roll of bubble wrap . If you have extra, add a second layer for even more pops!"

      "title": "Broken Remote",
      "content": "Broken Remote This prank is a good one to do at home in the morning so you can catch your family off-guard later that evening when they sit down to watch TV. Just use a small piece of clear tape to cover the sensor on the remote. This interferes with the signal and “breaks” the remote, so it won’t do anything. Another way to temporarily “break” the remote is to secretly take out the batteries and then put the cover back on."

      "title": "Refrigerator Snake",
      "content": "Refrigerator Snake Put a realistic-looking fake snake in the refrigerator. Try wrapping it around the bottom of the milk jug so it’s easy to see as soon as someone opens the door. Make sure it’s at about eye level so there’s no way they can miss it. Then, just wait for your target to get a cool drink. You can speed up the prank by asking your target to get you something from the refrigerator, but that might tip them off that something is going on."
    },
    {
      "title": "Something Cool",
      "content": "Something Cool This is the easiest prank ever! All you have to do is call your target over to a window and then say something like, “Do you see it? It’s so cool!” Take it to the next level by describing the cool thing you “see.” When they say they don’t see anything, point and say, “It’s right there! How can you not see it?” For example, say, “It’s an owl the size of a German Shepard. How are you missing it? Do you need glasses?”"

It’s really gross.” Then, lead them to the bathroom, where it looks like the toilet is leaking poop. Be ready to clean this one up when the prank is done. Even though the mess is fake, no one else is going to want to touch it."

      "title": "Buggy Lamp",
      "content": "Buggy Lamp Lots of people are scared of bugs or spiders because they associate them with painful bites or something grosser. [4] X Research source Play off of that fear by taping a fake bug or spider on the inside of a lampshade. Then, when someone turns on the lamp, they’ll see the shadow of the bug and freak out! If you don’t have any fake bugs, print out a realistic outline of a bug. Carefully cut it out and tape it to the inside of the lamp."

      "title": "Trick Brownies",
      "content": "Trick Brownies Trace the letter E in different sizes on a piece of brown construction paper. Then, cut the E’s out and place them in the bottom of a cake pan. Cover the pan with a piece of aluminum foil. Carry the covered pan to where your target is and ask them if they’d like some brownies. When they say “yes,” let them peel back the foil to see the brown E’s. If you really want to be nice, have some real brownies to give them for being a good sport about your prank."

      "title": "Useless Pencil",
      "content": "Useless Pencil This prank is perfect for that friend at school who is always asking to borrow a pencil. Paint the lead tip of one of your pencils with clear nail polish. Let the polish dry. Then, the next time your friend asks for a pencil, hand it over and watch their confusion when it doesn’t write! If you want to use the pencil again—or let your friend use it—just sharpen it like you normally would. This one is also a good prank to play in school because it’s pretty straightforward and not too disruptive."

Once you get there, ask your friends if they want some candy. When they say yes, get the bag out and let them have a bite of the weird mix! Make sure none of your friends are allergic to any of the candy you give them before playing the prank. Peanut allergies are fairly common.

Just ask if they have pig’s feet. When they say “yes,” you say, “I hope you wear shoes so no one will notice!” Then, hang up.

      "title": "Useless Soap",
      "content": "Useless Soap This clever prank is really good because it uses a regular bar of soap, so the kid will never suspect anything is wrong until they’ve already been pranked. Just take a dry bar of soap and paint the top with a clear coat of nail polish. Once the polish is dry, flip the bar and paint the bottom. [5] X Research source Put the soap next to the sink or in the shower once the nail polish is dry. When the kid tries to use the soap, it won’t lather up.

You can make it even more believable by carefully taking the foil wrappers off of chocolate eggs and then wrapping them around the grapes.

      "content": "Save pranks for kids who are over 4 years old. One of the things that makes pranks fun is that the target recognizes the prank quickly after it happens and laughs along with the prankster. Very young children aren’t at the developmental stage where they can understand a prank. [6] X Research source Instead of laughing, a kid under the age of 4 may feel confused or even hurt that people are laughing at them. Pranking young children like this is a form of punching down because the prankster has more power in the situation simply because they understand what’s going on. When it comes to pranking young children, it’s also easy to cross the line into bullying. [7] X Research source It’s better to wait until they’re older and can have fun, too."
