Make sure that your razor is sharp, as razors with dull blades are more likely to cut you than sharp ones.

Shaving towards the angle of hair growth (known as the “grain”) ensures that your razor travels smoothly, which will help you avoid cuts and razor burn. [17] X Research source [18] X Expert Source Juan Sabino Professional Barber Expert Interview. 28 January 2020. Identify the grain by running your fingertips through your hair. If your fingertips encounter resistance, you’re moving your fingers against the grain, whereas if your fingertips move smoothly across the hair, you’re moving with the grain. Some people shave their legs against the grain. However, only do this after your hairs are very short, since shaving against the grain while your hair is long could tug the hair from its follicle, which can irritate your skin.
