After you and your opponent have each had an opportunity to go first, you should consider playing with the pie rule (as described below in method 2), but it's easiest to start with this method first, which follows standard rules of play.

      "title": "Place the board in-between the 2 players.",
      "content": "Place the board in-between the 2 players. The 2 players should be seated opposite each-other, with the board oriented horizontally between them. Technically this orientation is not mandatory, but it is the standard arrangement, and the rest of the instructions are written under the assumption that you're seated in this fashion."

      "title": "Place the seeds in the pits.",
      "content": "Place the seeds in the pits. You have 48 tokens - called seeds - total, and 12 concave indentations - called pits. This means there should be four seeds in each pit. Do not place seeds in the larger basins on either end of the board. Those are not pits, they are the stores."

      "title": "Choose which player is going to go first.",
      "content": "Choose which player is going to go first. As mentioned above, the first player has an advantage. However, complete beginners probably won't capitalize on this advantage, so for your first couple of games you can simply select the first player at random."

    {
      "title": "Take turns sowing seeds.",
      "content": "Take turns sowing seeds. On each player's turn, they choose one pit on their side of the board (ie. one of the 6 pits in the row closer to them), and \"sow\" the seeds in that pit. The selected pit must not be empty . To sow the seeds, take all of the seeds out of the selected pit. Then, proceeding counter-clockwise, place one seed in each of the subsequent pits. So, if you select a pit with 4 seeds in it, all 4 seeds should be removed, and the next 4 pits should each have 1 seed added to them. You also place seeds in your own store, but not your opponent's store. If you have enough seeds to reach your opponent's store, simply skip it and place the next seed in the first pit of your own row."

      "content": "Capture seeds. If the last seed sown in step 6 is placed in an empty pit on your side of the board, and there are seeds in the adjacent pit on the opponent's side of the board, take all seeds in the aforementioned adjacent pit, and the seed which was just sown, and place them in your store."

      "title": "End the game when one player's 6 pits are all empty.",
      "content": "End the game when one player's 6 pits are all empty. The player who still has seeds left in their pits captures those seeds and puts them in their store. Players compare the number of seeds in their store. The player with the most seeds wins. If both players have the same number of seeds, it's a tie. Note that a player is guaranteed to win if they ever accumulate over half of the seeds in their store - so you can choose to end the game as soon as you notice that either player has accumulated more than 24 seeds. In this case, that player would win."

      "title": "Look at the offset first-play advantages.",
      "content": "Look at the offset first-play advantages. To offset the first-play advantage mentioned above in method 1, many players choose to use the pie rule. The pie rule is so named because it mimics the technique many use for divvying up the last piece of pie - one person cuts, the other chooses. The only thing that the pie rule changes is how the game starts, the rest of the game remains the same. The following 2 steps should be carried out after the first player is selected, as described in step 5 above. [2] X Research source"

They have 2 options, either they take a normal turn, in which case play proceeds as usual, or they steal the first turn. If they choose to steal the first turn, rotate the board. From here, it is as if the chooser took the first turn. The cutter takes the second turn, and play proceeds as usual."
