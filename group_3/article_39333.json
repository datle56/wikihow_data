      "content": "Shein’s Free Trial is a program to encourage customers to review products. Free Trial gives customers a chance to try out new clothing or items for free and post a detailed review of what they receive, including the quality, fit, size, style, fabric, and construction. You get to keep the item afterward, and customers get an honest review before they buy the same product. [1] X Research source There’s no downside to Shein’s Free Trial program—although Shein doesn’t pay testers in cash, getting free items may be worth clicking the “Free Trial” button. You can also become an “unofficial” tester by becoming an influencer and advertising your Shein purchases through Instagram, Pinterest, or YouTube."

      "content": "Yes, as long as you use the official Shein website to avoid scammers. The Shein Free Trial program is a real, legitimate service set up by the clothing company. However, it may be easy to run into illegitimate scammers when you’re searching for the reviewer program. When submitting your account to one of the items you would like to try, make sure that you do so on the official Shein Google or Play Store app or on their official Free Trial page . Here are some ways to avoid Shein website scams: [10] X Research source Make sure that the domain name matches Shein’s official website. The real Shein website will say [11] X Research source in the web address. Check for a legitimate contact page with the company’s address and employee information. Most scam sites will not have one. Watch for prices that are 50% lower than Shein’s on-site pricing—extreme discounts or “free” items are always suspicious. Shein only uses email and in-site chat for customer service, so don’t share any personal/payment information through a phone call, text message, or WhatsApp."
