      "content": "If the speed is set too high, your mouse might be registering excess clicks within a single click, causing the \"double-click when I single-click\" issue. Here's how to fix the click speed based on your operating system: Windows 10 : Go to Settings > Bluetooth & devices > Mouse > Additional mouse options . Drag the Double-click speed slider to the left, which is slower. If you move too close to Slow , however, Windows might consider two single clicks to be a double-click, which introduces a new issue. Double-click the folder icon on the right to test out your click speed. Windows 11 : Go to Settings > Bluetooth & devices > Mouse > Additional mouse settings . In the window that pops up, select the Buttons tab. Adjust the Speed slider under the Double-click speed header.

      "content": "Whether your mouse is wired or wireless, it probably has a USB cable or dongle. Many Bluetooth-enabled mice use a USB dongle to connect to the computer. You should move it to another port on your computer to see if the issue is your USB port, cable, or dongle. Avoid using a USB hub and plug it directly into your computer. If the port on your computer isn't good, then you'll notice that your mouse behavior has improved."

      "content": "Use a small tool like a toothpick to remove gunk and debris from small crevices. If your mouse has a trackball, remove it and clean each of the sensors gently. You can use a can of air or blow under the area where you click—there might be a wad of dust or a chip remnant stuck there that's preventing your mouse from clicking properly. Some users report this fix: Squeeze the buttons for about 10 seconds (really hard, though be careful not to break it). Shake the mouse. Blow into the underside of the mouse (near the buttons) and shake it again. You may need to repeat this process a few times to get this temporary fix working.

      "content": "All mice need updated drivers to function properly. However, not all mice come with a firmware suite that keeps you updated (like Logi Options+). Older mice with fewer features most likely don't have to worry about firmware updates, but users with fancy mice should check their mice's software or the manufacturer's website for those. Everyone, regardless of how fancy or not fancy your mouse is, must keep their drivers up-to-date . There are a few different ways that you can do this: Automatically for Windows and Mac : Most operating systems will automatically update drivers with a security update. For Windows, go to Settings > Update & Security (Win 10 only) > Windows Update > Check for updates . For Mac, go to System Settings > General > Software Update .
