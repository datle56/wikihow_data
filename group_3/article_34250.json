Lower your center of gravity down, pausing only when your thighs are completely parallel with the ground. Then, raise yourself back up to your original position.

      "title": "Do forward lunges",
      "content": "Do forward lunges to stretch your hip flexors. Kneel down on your left knee and bend your right leg in front of you at a 90-degree angle. Lunge forward with your right leg, keeping your back and torso upright as you move. Stay in this position for 5 seconds before repeating the stretch with your other leg. [4] X Research source Reps: 3-6 per leg A good lunge provides a comfortable stretch along one side of your groin. The more flexible these muscles are, the easier it will be to do splits."

      "title": "Stretch your hip flexors",
      "content": "Stretch your hip flexors with a side-lying pose. Lie comfortably on your left side, bending both knees so they stay lined up with your pelvis. Bend your left, forward-facing knee at a right angle as you guide your right leg behind you. Gently grab your right ankle and leg with your right hand, keeping your back straight as you go. Stay in this stretch for around 30 seconds before switching sides. [5] X Research source Reps: 3 on each side Hip flexors play an important role in your splits, so it’s important to keep them stretched and flexible."

Sandwich the bottoms of your feet together and hold them in place with your hands. Then, lean forward and push on your thighs with your elbows for 20-30 seconds—this creates a nice stretch in your inner thighs.

Grab the ball of your right foot with both hands and lightly tug it toward you for 20 seconds. Then, repeat this exercise with your other leg. [8] X Research source Hamstring Alternative: Straighten your leg out completely and grab your heel with both hands (rather than reaching for the top of your foot). Then, slowly lean forward, guiding your chest toward your extended leg. Stay in this position for 20 seconds, and then switch legs."

Then, grab your lower calves with both hands and guide your legs apart in a V-shape. Pull your legs as far apart as you comfortably can, creating a wider V-shape in the air. Hold them in place for 20 seconds. [9] X Research source Your ultimate goal is to finish this stretch with both knees touching the ground (with your legs creating a straight line rather than a “V”). It takes a lot of stretching and patience to get this flexible, though, so don’t feel discouraged if you can’t do this right away!"
