On the authority of God’s Word, I bind and break any curses, hexes, spells, bewitchments, witchcraft, sorcery, or magic being sent against me or my loved ones. I tear down any witchcraft altars erected against me. Through the power of Jesus’ shed blood, I nullify their power and dissolve any effects they have had in my life or affairs. I plead the promises of your protection in Psalm 91. I dwell in the shelter of the Most High. You alone are my refuge, my fortress.Under your wings, I take my refuge. Your faithfulness is my shield and rampart. No evil shall befall me, no scourge come near me. So I declare your Word against any agents of darkness sending evil my way. Holy Spirit, strengthen me with your power in my inner being. Make me alert, sober, and vigilant against the demonic forces trying to undermine my life and walk with God. Help me recognize and quench all the fiery darts of the enemy. Lord Jesus, send battalions of your warring angels to fight on my behalf, to dismantle any satanic attack being waged against my body, mind, family, finances, relationships, and soul. May they hedge me in and protect me. Holy Spirit, reveal to me any way I may have unknowingly partnered with darkness so I can repent and break all ungodly ties or covenants.I praise you, God, that no weapon formed against me shall prosper. Greater is the Holy Spirit living in me than any curse that could be pronounced. I overcome by the blood of the Lamb. Through Christ, I am more than a conqueror! All glory, power, and majesty to your Name alone! Amen!"

I cast all of my anxieties on you because you care for me as a great Father. (1 Peter 5:6-7) You are my light and my salvation so I do not fear. As the Lord God, you are the stronghold of my life, so I am not afraid. (Psalm 27:1) I come before you today Lord to contend with and break off every mind control stronghold that is over my mind, in Jesus name. Father I bind and I cast into the Abyss all witchcraft mind control spirits that are operating in my life, in Jesus name. All controlling powers that are being used to keep me in bondage in the spirit and under their control I declare that they are burned to ashes by the fire of God, in Jesus name. I bind and I cast into the Abyss the spirit of Baal with all of their lies, deception, confusion, divination, and strong delusions, in Jesus name. Now fill me Lord with more self control, discipline, stability and wisdom. Lord, in your word it says to cast down imaginations and every high thing that exalts itself against the knowledge of God, and to bring into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ Jesus! So I command every false lie that comes to my mind to be cast down into the pit of hell and destroyed by the burning sulfur of fire, in Jesus name. I rebuke every spirit that is trying to rob me of my free will to think and make decisions on my own, in Jesus name. I rebuke all spirits that are trying to play a higher role than God in my life, by manipulating things to control my thoughts and actions in my dream state, in Jesus name. I command every chain and every other form of bondage used against me to be destroyed by the fire of God. I command my release now, in Jesus name! I rebuke and I bind all octopus and squid spirits in Jesus name. I command every unclean spirit to loose their grip off of my mind now. I rebuke and I bind all controlling spirits from the marine kingdom, in Jesus name. Heavenly Father, replace this new space with more of your spirit Lord. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Various biblical scriptures mention both witchcraft and spiritual warfare. They involve multiple biblical figures who either turned away from God or did not follow God’s word. These figures also sometimes took part in witchcraft practices, from seeing a medium to believing in omens. Whether they were arrogant or believed in idol worship, these verses from the Bible are clear about their standing with God. [4] X Research source “Saul died because he was unfaithful to the LORD; he did not keep the word of the LORD and even consulted a medium for guidance.” — Chronicles 10:13 “He sacrificed his children in the fire in the Valley of Ben Hinnom, practiced divination and witchcraft, sought omens, and consulted mediums and spiritists. He did much evil in the eyes of the LORD, arousing his anger.” — 2 Chronicles 33:6 “I will set my face against anyone who turns to mediums and spiritists to prostitute themselves by following them, and I will cut them off from their people.” — Leviticus 20:6 “The light of a lamp will never shine in you again. The voice of bridegroom and bride will never be heard in you again. Your merchants were the world’s important people. By your magic spell all the nations were led astray.” — Revelation 18:23 “The acts of the flesh are obvious: sexual immorality, impurity and debauchery; idolatry and witchcraft; hatred, discord, jealousy, fits of rage, selfish ambition, dissensions, factions, and envy; drunkenness, orgies, and the like. I warn you, as I did before, that those who live like this will not inherit the kingdom of God.” — Galatians 5:19-21 “When this became known to the Jews and Greeks living in Ephesus, they were all seized with fear, and the name of the Lord Jesus was held in high honor. Many of those who believed now came and openly confessed what they had done. A number who had practiced sorcery brought their scrolls together and burned them publicly. When they calculated the value of the scrolls, the total came to fifty thousand drachmas.” — Acts 19:17-19 “Do not turn to mediums or seek out spiritists, for you will be defiled by them. I am the LORD your God.” — Leviticus 19:31 “Let no one be found among you who sacrifices their son or daughter in the fire, who practices divination or sorcery, interprets omens, engages in witchcraft, or casts spells, or who is a medium or spiritist or who consults the dead. Anyone who does these things is detestable to the LORD; because of these same detestable practices, the LORD your God will drive out those nations before you.” — Deuteronomy 18:10-12"
