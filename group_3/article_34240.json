If you've just started having sex, have a new sexual partner, or are having sex more often than usual, you may have a higher risk of developing a UTI. Although it's always important to keep your genital area clean, drink plenty of water, and urinate frequently, try to be especially mindful of these and other preventative measures if your sexual habits have changed recently.

      "content": "Wash your genital area every day and before you have sex. One of the easiest ways to help prevent a UTI is to keep your genital area clean. Wash the area thoroughly with soap and warm water, and pat your skin dry with a soft towel after you get out of the shower. If you think you'll be romantic with your sexual partner, wash the area again to ensure there's no bacteria that can make its way into your urethra. [4] X Research source Also, make sure to carefully wash the skin around your anus, as bacteria from that area can enter your urethra, especially if you're a female. [5] X Trustworthy Source American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists Professional association of OB/GYNs focused on education and public outreat initiatives Go to source Taking showers instead of baths may also help decrease the risk of developing a UTI.

      "content": "Try to urinate before and after you have sex. Visit the bathroom before sex to cleanse away bacteria so it doesn't get pushed up into your urethra during sex. As soon as you get a chance after you and your partner have sex, take a trip to the restroom. Emptying your bladder after sexual intercourse can help wash away any bacteria that might have gotten into your urethra. [8] X Research source The sooner you can go, the less opportunity the bacteria will have to travel up your urethra, so try not to wait if you can help it. Urinating before sex may help flush out any bacteria that could be spread during intercourse. However, it may also make it harder to empty your bladder after sex."

If that's the case, talk to your doctor about prescribing you a low-dose antibiotic. Often, your doctor will direct you to take one antibiotic pill after you have sex to help your body fight off any infections. Your doctor may also ask you to take a low-dose antibiotic once a day for about 6 months, or they may prefer to only prescribe you antibiotics when you have an active UTI.

If you wipe from back to front, you could be spreading bacteria from your bowels toward your urethra, which could lead to a UTI.

      "content": "Wear loose-fitting clothes and underwear with a cotton crotch. Keep yourself fresh and cool by wearing underwear made from cotton or another breathable material. Cotton underwear will allow sweat and other moisture to evaporate off of your skin, so bacteria will have less of a chance to multiply. In addition, avoid wearing tight-fitting pants that constrict or irritate your genital area, as this can trap moisture and increase your risk of a UTI. Avoid wearing nylon underwear. These will leave moisture trapped against your skin, which can allow bacteria to grow."

      "content": "Drink 6-8 glasses of water a day. Since a UTI is caused by bacteria in your bladder or urethra, one easy way to help prevent the infection is by drinking plenty of water each day. As you urinate, you'll flush the bacteria out of your urinary tract. This is also a good way to shorten the duration of a UTI if you do get one. If you drink cranberry or blueberry juice to prevent UTIs, you can count it toward your fluid intake for the day. Any fluids will work to flush the bacteria out of your system.
