      "title": "Plan your reading.",
      "content": "Plan your reading. There are 52 weeks in a year, meaning you need to read about two books a week if you want to read 100 books in the year. This amounts to an average of 3.5 days to read each book. This may sound daunting, but remember, some books will be shorter and only take a day or two to read. [1] X Research source Try to stick to an average of two books a week. There will be ebbs and flows in your reading. Some weeks you may only read half a book while other weeks you may read five books. If you’re feeling overwhelmed about your lack of progress, read a few shorter books to get ahead quickly."

You may think you have no time for reading, but take a good look at your day and see what you can find. Do you watch T.V. after dinner for an hour or more? Do you spend a lot of time on Buzzfeed, Facebook, or other time-wasting sites? Do you binge Netflix? Use the time you spend on these activities and re-allocate it to reading. [3] X Research source You don’t have to completely remove these activities from your schedule, but cut back on them and use that time for reading."

GoodReads is easy to use and you will get recommendations based on what you have read to help you find new books to read.

      "content": "Set-up a system to optimize reading time. Everyone is different, but find what works for you. Turn off all of your electronics at least an hour before you normally go to bed and read until you fall asleep. If you’re eating alone, read a book. If you’re waiting to meet up with a friend, take out that book while you wait. [5] X Research source Once you start increasing your reading, you’ll find it easier to find more time to read."

      "content": "Listen to audiobooks in the car or when walking. Remember, audiobooks are books too. If you have a long commute, listen to an audiobook. You can also listen to books while cooking dinner or taking a walk. This is a great way to optimize time that you otherwise couldn’t be reading. [6] X Research source Audiobooks can be expensive, but look at your local library to see if you can check some out from there. Audiobook subscriptions are also a cheaper way to get audiobooks."

      "content": "Join or start a book club. Being part of a regular book club is a good way to stay motivated with your reading challenge. It will introduce new books into your reading cycle and is a great way to stay on track. It would be even more fun to start a book club with your friends. Challenge them to read 100 books a year with you. Keep score! If they start beating you, it will motivate you to read more!"

      "content": "Read every single day. You don't have to read for hours and hours every day, but you will need to read for a reasonable amount of time every day, depending on how fast you read and how long the book you're reading is. Add reading to your daily routine and try to read as often as possible. Aim to read about ten hours a week. [7] X Research source If you commute, read on the train. Read on your breaks at work instead of socializing. Read at the doctor’s office while you wait for you appointment. Read instead of checking social media or watching T.V."

      "content": "Stop reading a book if you don’t like it. This might be hard for people who like to finish what they have started, but if the book isn’t engaging, you are less likely to read it. If you’re not inspired to read, it will be more difficult for you to read. Choose books that are relevant to what is currently happening in your life. [8] X Research source If you’re reading a book you just can’t put down, it will be easier to read more often. Not every book is for you. Don’t feel guilty because you can’t get excited about a book your friends have raved about. Read what interests you!"

You can download e-reader apps to your phone and have a book with you at all times. If you have an e-reader, you can sync your phone reading to your e-reader so you never lose your place. Small ten minute reading sessions while waiting for the bus will add up over time."

      "title": "Read multiple books at the same time.",
      "content": "Read multiple books at the same time. Have a few books in various subjects going at one time. Choose a fiction book for light reading before bed and a more complicated non-fiction book for a challenge. You may not be in the mood for one book, but since you’re reading more than one book, you have options! [9] X Research source Having multiple books encourages you to read more often because you can read what you are most interested in at that moment."

      "title": "Choose a new book to read before you finish the current one.",
      "content": "Choose a new book to read before you finish the current one. Even if you’re reading multiple books simultaneously, they are likely in different genres. Choose the next book you want to read in each genre before you are finished with the current one, so you don’t stall in your reading. Browsing the new releases at the library is a great way to find something interesting to read. [10] X Research source If you have money to spend, go to the bookstore and buy a new or used book. The more books you own, the more options you have to read. This will keep your momentum going to reach your goal of 100+ books. Buying books in bulk guarantees that you will always have a book nearby to start immediately after finishing the last one. An alternative to buying in bulk is to use the library, borrow books from a friend, or use ebook sites with free downloads such as Project Gutenberg, iBooks, and Libri Vox. Keep a list of books you want to read and refer to that when you’re having trouble figuring out what to read."

Maybe you want to read a few books from each genre or all of the books by a specific author. You could also do something like “Reading the World” or going through the bestsellers that year. [11] X Research source Even if you don’t make it through the list, it’s a good place to find ideas for what to read next."
