      "title": "Drink plenty of water.",
      "content": "Drink plenty of water. In the days and hours leading up to a performance, make sure to drink plenty of water. Water keeps your vocal cords from drying out, which is important before you sing. Stick to plain water for hydration over things like juice and soda."
    },
    {
      "title": "Use a personal humidifier.",
      "content": "Use a personal humidifier. A humidifier can help keep your vocal cords from drying out and is a great tool for singers. This is particularly helpful if you live in a dry region. Look for a personal, handheld humidifier that you can use before warming up to moisturize your throat and nasal passages. You can choose to put a humidifier in your home, as well, if the humidity level is below 40-50%."

      "title": "Watch your diet.",
      "content": "Watch your diet. The foods you eat actually have an effect on your voice. Avoid dairy, pasta, and chocolate, as these substances can leave your voice dry. Instead, go for things like fruits (such as apples) to lubricate your vocal cords as well as soup (such as chicken noodle). Avoid eating right before you sing or within 2-3 hours of going to bed, as this can increase the amount of stomach acid you produce and irritate or damage your vocal cords."

      "title": "Avoid caffeine.",
      "content": "Avoid caffeine. Caffeine is a diuretic. It can leave your voice dry and scratchy. Avoid caffeinated beverages, like coffee, before a big performance or audition."

      "title": "Have a warm drink just before singing.",
      "content": "Have a warm drink just before singing. Go for something like non-caffeinated herbal teas or water with lemon and honey. This can soothe and hydrate your throat, helping you sing more efficiently. Remember to avoid sugary or caffeinated beverages before singing."

      "title": "Activate your breath.",
      "content": "Activate your breath. Breathing should always be the first thing you do to warm up. To start warming up, practice breath relaxation by taking a few normal breaths. As you breathe, be conscious of your body and adjust it as necessary to get into the right position to sing. [1] X Research source Take note of your shoulders and chest. Make sure they're relaxed and low. Make sure you channel your breaths to your lower abdomen rather than your chest. It can help to put a hand on your lower abdomen and make sure your hand rises and falls as you breathe. Hold an \"S\" sound as you exhale to get your vocal cords going. Repeat as many breaths as you need to feel like you're breathing slow, deep, and steady."

      "title": "Do lip and tongue trills.",
      "content": "Do lip and tongue trills. Lip and tongue trills prepare your lips and tongues for singing. Do some scales while doing lip and tongue trills to warm up. [3] X Research source For a lip trill, push your lips together and make a raspberry sound by releasing the air. Try an \"h\" sound, then a \"b\" sound, and then try to use the \"b\" sound to do a scale. Do as much of the scale as you comfortably can doing lip trills. For a tongue trill, put your tongue just behind your upper teeth. Exhale using an \"r\" sound. Try to vary the pitch while you trill. Vary the pitch as much as is comfortable for you."

      "title": "Sing some scales.",
      "content": "Sing some scales. Start at a lower pitch and work your way up a basic scale. If you've never done scales before, you listen to scales online and use them as a guide. A vocal instructor can also help you master scales. [4] X Research source Use a \"me\" sound to work your way up the scale. Go as high as you comfortably can. Use an \"e\" sound and then work your way back down the scale."

    {
      "title": "Hum.",
      "content": "Hum. Humming gets your lips, teeth, and facial bones prepped to sing. Press your lips together and release your jaw and then hum. Use a nasal sound, humming using the same types of breaths you use to sigh. Then, glide from a high to low pitch. [5] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Cool down.",
      "content": "Cool down. After you finish a warm up, do a few more minutes of gentle humming. Do not attempt to vary your pitch too much and focus on the lips as you hum. Use the \"m\" sound as you hum and try to get your nose and lips vibrating slightly. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Choose the right music.",
      "content": "Choose the right music. If you're doing a show or audition, choose music that resonates with you personally and highlights your vocal range. Go for songs within your vocal range, preferably ones you have previously performed publicly with success. Avoid picking a song that's unfamiliar or overly challenging for you. This can throw you off at a performance or audition. [7] X Research source"

      "title": "Learn the meaning of the lyrics.",
      "content": "Learn the meaning of the lyrics. You need to bring some emotional resonance to the performance. Before singing in public, give the meaning of a song's lyrics serious consideration. Find a personal connection to the song that allows you to best convey its underlying feeling. Read the lyrics online and think about each word. Ask yourself what the writer is trying to say and what underlying emotions are at play. Try to identify with the song on a personal level. For example, if a song is sad or melancholy, think of a time you've experienced these emotions personally."
