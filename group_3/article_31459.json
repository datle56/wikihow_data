      "content": "See your vet right away if your dog has parvo. In the majority of cases, parvovirus is fatal without effective treatment. If you can, it's usually best to let your dog stay at a veterinary hospital if they're infected with parvo. Your dog might need IV fluids, medications to stop their nausea and vomiting, and sometimes a feeding tube or even blood transfusions. [2] X Research source However, if your dog is only mildly to moderately sick, you may be able to treat them at home under your vet's supervision. [3] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Keep in mind that parvo is also extremely contagious, and your vet will be able to isolate your dog more effectively than you can do at home. Ask your vet what symptoms would indicate that you need to bring in your vet for treatment."

      "title": "Use subcutaneous fluids to rehydrate your dog while they're vomiting.",
      "content": "Use subcutaneous fluids to rehydrate your dog while they're vomiting. Since your dog won't be able to hold down fluids while they're vomiting profusely, they can quickly become dehydrated. You can help by giving them subcutaneous fluids, which are delivered under the skin. Ask your vet exactly which fluids to use—veterinarians typically recommend a saline (isotonic sodium chloride) or lactated Ringer (LR) solution. They can also advise you on what dose to use and how often to give the fluids. [4] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source IV fluids are more effective for hydrating your dog, but these need to be administered by a vet. In seriously ill animals, their circulation is often so poor that the fluids are poorly absorbed from beneath the skin—you'll need to take the dog in for IV fluids for them to have the best chance of recovery. Your vet will typically provide you with a kit that contains a fluid bag, a tube and spike, and a subcutaneous needle. If you can't get to your vet, ask the vet clinic to recommend a veterinary supply store near you where you can purchase these items."

      "title": "Attach the tube to the fluid bag.",
      "content": "Attach the tube to the fluid bag. The subcutaneous fluids should be contained in a large bag, similar to an IV bag. Lay the bag on a flat surface and remove the plug from the end of the bag. Then, open the bag that holds the tube. One end will have a spike that you can insert into the fluid bag. Pull the cap off the spike, then push the spike into the nozzle on the end of the fluid bag. However, avoid touching the area where you're going to insert the spike—this is sterile, so you don't want to contaminate it. [5] X Research source Before you connect the tube, make sure the clamps on the tube are closed so the fluids won't flow out when you insert the spike. Properly dispose of the needle you're using away when you're done. Don't reuse a needle, as it can contaminate the fluids Talk to your vet about whether or not it's appropriate to keep fluids for more than one use."

      "title": "Hang the bag or hold it up.",
      "content": "Hang the bag or hold it up. Once the tube is connected to the fluid bag, hang the bag from something like your shower rod or a doorknob. If you don't have anything to hang it from, ask someone to hold it for you—it just needs to be placed somewhere higher than the dog, because gravity will help the fluids flow more easily.

      "content": "Bleed any air out of the tube. Undo any clamps that are on the tube. You'll see fluid start to collect in the small chamber under the bag. Then, it will start to flow into the tube. Let the whole tube fill up with water to make sure there isn't any air in the line. Then, reclamp the line. [7] X Research source If there's any air in the line, it will go under your dog's skin, which could be painful."

      "content": "Make sure your dog is settled. It's a good idea to calm your dog before you do the actual injection. Have them lay down, and if possible, have someone else hold on to them while you're working so the dog doesn't try to run away. If your dog is really anxious, it can help to wrap your dog in a towel to calm them. [9] X Research source"

      "content": "Give the injection between your dog's shoulder blades. Pinch the loose skin on your dog's back to create a tent shape. Hold the needle so the bevel—or angled end—is pointed up toward the ceiling, then insert it straight into the loose skin in one quick motion. Hold it in place securely, then open the clamp so the fluids can flow under the dog's skin. You'll see the fluids dripping into the chamber and running through the tube. [10] X Research source You can gently squeeze the bag to help the fluids move faster, but keep in mind that this may make some dogs feel anxious. [11] X Research source The fluids will make a bump under the skin, but they will be taken into the bloodstream soon as long as the dog is not in shock and has a good circulatory system.

      "title": "Remove the needle when the fluids are injected.",
      "content": "Remove the needle when the fluids are injected. Place a piece of gauze over the needle, then slide the needle out from the skin. Hold the gauze in place for a few moments to keep the fluids from leaking out. If any fluid does leak out, it may have a little blood in it—that's normal. [13] X Research source Over time, the bump where you administered the fluids should disappear as the fluids are absorbed. If it doesn't, contact your vet. Talk to your vet about exactly how much fluid to use and how often to repeat it. However, a good rule of thumb is to give them 40ml of fluid for every 1 kg (2.2 lb) that your animal weighs. Do that every 8 hours."

Once your dog is able to keep fluids down, you can use an electrolyte infusion meant for dogs to help them get hydrated. Wait until your dog has stopped vomiting for 6-12 hours before you give them anything to drink. Your dog might prefer one of these rehydration drinks to plain water, so they may be more likely to accept it.

[25] X Research source Parvo is mainly passed through feces and fluids passing from one dog to another. It can even be passed by your dog sniffing another dog. If you have other dogs in the house, make sure that your sick dog is using the bathroom in a different area from your other dogs, as your dogs can catch it from the sick dog's feces as long as 2 months after the symptoms have passed."

That will kill the virus—but it only works on hard surfaces. [27] X Research source For other areas, such as carpet and couches, wipe as clean as possible, and then get them steam cleaned. You might also consider quaternary ammonia for cleaning soft surfaces. For outdoor areas, the best you can do is pick up any of your dog's feces and water the yard a bit more often. The dilution can help lower the amount of virus in your yard over time, and the sun will also kill some of it. Try to keep other dogs out of the area for at least a few weeks."
