[3] X Trustworthy Source American Psychological Association Leading scientific and professional organization of licensed psychologists Go to source Exercise also releases endorphins, chemicals that trigger positive feelings. Here are some great ways to exercise: Take up running. Running releases endorphins and can make you feel great after you do it. Try setting a goal for yourself, like running a 5k or 10k race. This will keep you motivated and make you feel more capable of meeting and tackling challenges. Join a pool and swim a mile every other day. Immersing yourself in water will make you feel stronger and will wash away any of your stressful thoughts. This is also a good activity if you have any joint or muscle pain. Take a yoga class. Yoga is not only great for you physically, but it will help you learn to regulate your breath and your mind's wanderings. Join a team sport, like bowling, volleyball, or softball. You'll be able to make new friends and workout at the same time. In other words, you get the benefits of socialization AND exercising in one go. Take up hiking. You'll feel less stressed if you spend more time in nature and exposed to fresh air."

Always make sure to consult your physician or other health practitioner before using any new herbs or supplements.

Perhaps most commonly ingested as a tea, chamomile is often used to relieve stress-induced symptoms, such as insomnia and upset stomachs. Passionflower - Passionflower plants have been used to treat sleep disorders, anxiety, and gastrointestinal problems. Recent research has suggested that passionflower can be as effective as prescriptive chemical drugs in treating anxiety. Passionflower is usually ingested as a tea. Lavender - Research has shown that lavender can produce calming, soothing, and sedative effects when its scent is inhaled. For this reason, lavender is often used in aromatherapy oils, teas, soaps, bath gels and lotions, among many other commercial products.

Deep breathing is also known as diaphragmatic breathing, abdominal breathing, belly breathing, and paced respiration. Deep breathing encourages full oxygen exchange, meaning the trade of incoming fresh oxygen for outgoing carbon dioxide. This helps to slow the heartbeat and stabilize or even lower blood pressure. [21] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Medical School Harvard Medical School's Educational Site for the Public Go to source Begin by finding a quiet and comfortable place to sit or lie down. Take a normal breath or two to settle yourself. Then try a deep breath: breathe in slowly through your nose, allowing your chest and lower belly to expand as you fill your lungs. Let your abdomen expand fully. Don't hold it back, as many of us tend to do. Now breathe out slowly through your mouth (or your nose, if that feels more natural). Once you feel comfortable doing this after a few practice rounds, move on to the regular form of breath focus. As you sit with your eyes closed, complement your deep breathing with helpful imagery and perhaps a focus word or phrase that helps you relax. [22] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Medical School Harvard Medical School's Educational Site for the Public Go to source Why doesn't shallow breathing have the same effect? Shallow breathing in fact does the opposite by limiting the motion of the diaphragm.

It can be helpful to consult your journal and review all of the things you are stressing over but can't control, including traffic, who your boss and coworkers are, economic ups and downs, etc. It's not easy to realize that you can't control anything but you may find it empowering in the end. For example, in this process you will realize that the only thoughts and behaviors you can control are your own. You can't control what your boss thinks about you or what your in-laws say; instead, what you CAN control are your responses and reactions to them.

Though you may not be able to single-handedly eliminate all of the things that are stressing you out, you may be able to alleviate them to some degree and, most importantly, prevent them from worsening and having increasingly adverse effects on your mental and physical well-being. Address any stressful situations in the workplace. If you feel overworked or undervalued, talk to your boss in a calm and reasonable manner. If you feel that you're over-committed at work, find a way to do half an hour less work a day, perhaps by cutting out distractions or unnecessary breaks in your work flow. Look for solutions that will help you reduce that particular stressor without adding any additional stress. Learn how to be assertive to communicate your needs so that they are taken seriously.

If you're stressed out about the state of your relationship with a partner, family member or friend, it's best to start a conversation than to wait around to see what happens. The sooner you open up about the stress the relationship is causing you, the sooner you can begin to resolve it. Address the \"little things\" that need doing. Sometimes it can be the smallest things that add to our daily stress as they build up and remain undone. If you're feeling like you're starting to \"sweat the small stuff\", deal with these things directly. Make a to-do list of the little things (such as needing to change your oil to making a dentist appointment) that are nagging you and see how many you can get done in a month.

This will help you know what your days look like each week and month. In so doing, you'll have a better sense of what you need to do and how to plan for these things. Organize your short-term plans. If you're stressed at the thought of an upcoming trip, try to hammer out the details as early as you can so there are no x-factors. Knowing what's ahead will give you a sense of control and help you better manage any unforeseen circumstances. Organize your space. If you declutter your space , then your life will feel more organized and manageable. This may take some effort, but the benefits will outweigh the time you spend on getting everything right. Get rid of things you no longer use or need (such as old clothes, electronics or small appliances) and rearrange your space to make it as functional as possible. Try to maintain an organized and clean living space. Spend 10-15 minutes each night throwing out anything you don't need, cleaning, and putting everything back in its place.

Make appointments for yourself. This is something parents especially need to do--put aside time for one's self rather than children, community, church group, or whatever. Whether that is to go on a hike, take a hot bubble bath, or meet up with a friend--this is important time to put aside. Distinguish between \"shoulds\" and \"musts\". You must file your taxes on time, for instance. But feeling you should make homemade treats for your child's pre-school class may make you feel guilty when you simply do not have the time to make Pintrest-worthy food--if the children are perfectly happy with carrot sticks and ranch dip, why not opt for something simpler?

For example, if you know that traffic stresses you out because it is boring and wastes your time, ask yourself what you can do to change your experience of being in traffic. Come up with a range of solutions (such as listening to music or books on tape or getting a co-worker to carpool with you) and try them out. Assess methodically which is working best for you.
