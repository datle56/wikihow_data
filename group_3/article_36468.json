      "title": "Clean the glass to inspect the damage.",
      "content": "Clean the glass to inspect the damage. DIY scratch removal methods work best on shallow scratches, so it’s important to see how badly the glass is damaged. Spray the glass with glass cleaner and wipe it with a soft cloth. This will also help remove any coarse particles that could scuff the glass even more as you work. [1] X Research source Allow the glass to dry completely before attempting to remove the scratch. Test the damage by running your fingernail across it. If your nail catches in the scratch, it’s likely too deep to be repaired by DIY methods and it may be better to replace it."

      "title": "Use toothpaste for an easy option.",
      "content": "Use toothpaste for an easy option. Apply a small amount of white, non-gel toothpaste to a soft cleaning cloth and gently buff the scratch in small, circular motions. Then, rinse the glass with water and inspect the scratch. Repeat the process as needed until the scratch is removed. [2] X Research source Toothpaste that contains baking soda typically works best. If you see no progress after applying toothpaste 3 times, it may be better to try a different method. If you are cleaning a glass window , Gholian suggests using a squeegee to “work in an S pattern, and wipe any excess water and dirt from the blade as you go.” [3] X Expert Source Jon Gholian Cleaning Specialist Expert Interview. 15 December 2020."

      "title": "Try a baking soda paste as an alternative.",
      "content": "Try a baking soda paste as an alternative. In a bowl or container, mix equal parts of baking soda and water. Stir the mixture until it becomes a paste, then dip a soft cloth into it and dab a small amount onto the scratch. Work the paste into the scratch using a circular motion and check periodically to see how the scratch is looking. Rinse off the paste with water, and repeat as necessary until the scratch is gone. [4] X Research source In general, you’ll only need about a spoonful each of baking soda and water. It helps to wrap the cloth around your finger and press the cloth into the paste. This way, you’ll pick up a small amount of the paste."

      "title": "Use liquid pumice soap if you have it.",
      "content": "Use liquid pumice soap if you have it. Liquid pumice soap is a heavy-duty hand cleaner with abrasive elements that can sometimes remove scratches from glass. Apply a small amount of soap to a soft, damp cloth, then rub it onto the scratched surface using circular motions. Rinse the glass with a clean, damp cloth to check your progress, and repeat as necessary. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Buff the scratch with steel wool.",
      "content": "Buff the scratch with steel wool. Choose a fine #0000 steel wool to buff away existing scratches without creating more. Rub the wool in a circular motion over the scratch for several minutes. Then, rinse the glass with water to remove any residue and see if the scratch is gone. [6] X Research source Make sure the steel wool is new, as worn or rusty pads may damage the glass further. If the scratch remains after using the steel wool, it may be time to use a power tool or consider replacing the glass."

    {
      "title": "Try metal polish.",
      "content": "Try metal polish. Metal polish is designed to make metals brighter, but it’s also effective at removing scratches in glass. Dab a tiny amount of metal polish onto a clean, soft cloth, then rub the scratched glass in light, circular motions for about 30 seconds. The scratch should lessen or disappear entirely. Don’t add more polish, as using too much can damage the glass. Then, wash the remaining polish off with a clean, damp cloth. [7] X Research source Be sure to use the smallest amount of metal polish possible—just enough to visibly see it on the cloth. Metal polish that contains cerium oxide works the quickest. Jeweler’s rouge is a more expensive polish option. Metal polish is good for gently sanding large, delicate surfaces such as windshields. If the scratches don’t come out easily, consider sanding the glass. Apply your polish to an orbital sander fitted with a soft cloth or buffing wheel on a cordless drill . Follow the sander’s instructions to properly polish and sand the glass."

      "title": "Apply a glass polish.",
      "content": "Apply a glass polish. Choose a glass polish that contains cerium oxide—this often comes in the form of a powder that needs to be mixed with water. Then, apply the polish with a soft cloth or by placing it on a machine polisher, like a felt wheel on a rotary tool . Follow the instructions in the manual to use the machine correctly. Once the scratch is gone, clean the glass with a damp cloth and let it dry. [8] X Research source If you choose to use a rotary tool, place the polish on a felt wheel and run the tool on slow. If it dries out as you work, add more polisher as necessary. Alternatively, purchase a glass scratch filler kit online or at your local automotive or hardware store. These kits typically come with a glass-polishing compound and special pads for application. Follow the kit’s instructions to polish the glass correctly."

      "title": "Apply clear nail polish to hide scratches in glass.",
      "content": "Apply clear nail polish to hide scratches in glass. Use the nail polish applicator brush to apply a thin layer of polish to the entire scratched area. Let the nail polish dry for about an hour. Once it’s dry, lightly moisten a soft cloth with nail polish remover and wipe it across the surface to remove any excess nail polish outside of the scratch.

      "content": "Clean and dry glass with soft cloths. Gholian says, “Never use paper towels, lint towels, or newspapers [to clean]. These leave marks and scratches behind and should be avoided at all costs.” [10] X Expert Source Jon Gholian Cleaning Specialist Expert Interview. 15 December 2020. Instead, opt for soft cleaning cloths, like microfiber cloths , to clean and dry your glass. These are also less likely to leave fibers behind after wiping. [11] X Research source Make sure your cleaning cloth is free of grit and dirt, as these substances can scratch glass. When choosing a cleaner, make sure the product is labeled as “glass-safe” or “made for glass” to ensure they won’t damage the surface."

      "title": "Don’t wash glass with hard water.",
      "content": "Don’t wash glass with hard water. Hard water contains high levels of minerals that can damage glass and other surfaces. If you have hard water , use another source (like bottled water) if possible when cleaning glass. This will protect the surface from unnecessary scratches and it will make the glass easier to clean, as hard water tends to leave a residue."

      "title": "Avoid using hot or sharp objects near glass.",
      "content": "Avoid using hot or sharp objects near glass. This may sound obvious, but if you use sharp objects on glass surfaces, the glass is more likely to develop scratches. If you have glass table tops, avoid placing hot items like plates of cooking utensils directly on the table. Instead, use placemats, coasters, and cutting boards as needed. [12] X Research source It also helps to use a tablecloth or a table runner ."

      "content": "How do you remove scratches from windshields? Remove scratches from your windshield with a windshield repair kit . Clean your windshield with soap and water to remove dust and dirt and to inspect the damage. Follow the repair kit’s instructions to repair the scratch—in many cases, you’ll apply a resin compound directly to the scratch, then let it dry by parking your car in direct sunlight. [14] X Research source Zani doesn’t recommend trying DIY methods like toothpaste on windshields: “There's a couple of different kinds of urban myths out there about toothpaste being used to restore headlights and different parts of the vehicle. I don't know any professional [or] semi-professional person that takes those things seriously.” [15] X Expert Source Chad Zani Auto Detailing Expert Expert Interview. 2 October 2019. Instead, he recommends polishing the scratches out: “Glass can be polished like anything else. So, you know, you can start out and actually apply a compound or a polish to the glass.” [16] X Expert Source Chad Zani Auto Detailing Expert Expert Interview. 2 October 2019."

Alternatively, rubbing the surface with a pencil eraser can sometimes remove small scratches, as the eraser’s particles will fill them in. [17] X Research source While some people have had success with other DIY scratch removal methods, it’s generally best to avoid things like baking soda or toothpaste, as they’re too abrasive for phone screens. Consider buying a screen protector to prevent future scratches."

      "content": "How do you remove scratches from eyeglasses? In general, optometrists do not recommend attempting DIY methods to remove scratches from your glasses, as they often cause more damage. If you really want to attempt to remove the scratches yourself, first clean the lenses with a microfiber cloth. Then make a paste with equal parts baking soda and water and apply it to the scratch with a soft cloth. Rub the paste in with gentle, circular motions, then rinse the glasses with warm water, dry them, and repeat if necessary. [18] X Research source If the scratches are too deep, visit your optometrist to see if they can be fixed or if your lenses need to be replaced. While DIY methods can sometimes remove scratches, they may also remove special coatings on your glasses, like UV or blue light blocking. Try them at your own risk."
