Consider the following questions: Do you have any unique hobbies or skills? Maybe you are a musician or an artists. You can create a username that references your skills. For example, \"DungeonMasterDave\" or \"A_Guy_And_His_Guitar.\" What are you interested in? Do you like to talk about news and politics? Do you like anime? Coming up with a username that references something you are interested in is a good way to let people know what you like to talk about in advance. For example, \"DantheNewsDude\", or \"Anime_Steve.\" Are there any books, movies, video games, or characters you like? You can create a username that references one of your favorite characters or something from one of your favorite stories. For example, \"Bluecollar_Batman\" or \"MarinafromMordor.\" Do you have any special skills? If you plan on using your username for business purposes, you may want to reference your professional skills. For example, \"NursePatty\" or \"DavetheElectricMan.\""

You may want to think of something that references the slang or interests of the people from your specific age group. Do they share your interests or hobbies? If so, you may want to come up with a name that references the interests of the people you are communicating with. For example, \"Death_Metal_Daddy.\" Are they part of a specific group or subculture? How do you like to identify? Do you consider yourself alt or goth? Do you have a specific political affiliation? Maybe you are a member of the LGBTQ community. Maybe you consider yourself a gamer. Find a username that signals your identity. For example, \"Vampy_Kitten\" or \"EmoJerry.\" Do you have any special knowledge you'd like to share with people? Maybe you're a medical doctor or a lawyer who likes to share your perspective online. Perhaps you read a lot about history. If there is something you talk a lot about, you should consider finding a username that signals that you are knowledgeable about a specific subject. For example, \"Dan_the_MD\" or \"LegalMommy.\""

Like most people, you probably have one or two interests, traits, feelings, or habits that your friends and family attribute to you. These are things that set you apart from the bulk of the population. You can draw upon these as a basis for a good username. For example, mention a favorite thing like “agirlandherpinkhat” or “rileylovesmacaroni.” For a “Discord” account that only your friends will see, you can poke fun at yourself for a personality trait or tendency like “jasonisatitagain.” If you’re obsessed with kumquats, you might pick something like “kumquatkate.”"

In the left column, write down a list of adjectives (funny, lazy, spunky, sarcastic, etc.) that you’d use to describe yourself. In the right column, jot down a list of things you enjoy, like your favorite activities, favorite animals, and your number-one dessert choice. Then, combine one choice from each column until you find a pairing you really like! You’ll often find usernames that derive from this \"adjective-noun\" formula—for instance, \"DeviousChinchilla\" or \"AggravatedCremeBrulee.” So, while the formula itself isn’t unique, the combination you come up with can be. When in doubt, add the adjective “official,” “real,” or “just” in front of your username to create something like “justmartinmckenna” or “officiallizardcollector.”"

You can create absurd, nonsensical usernames in this way, which increases the chances of having a one-of-a-kind username. For example, if you like pandas and orcas, you might make your username \"WhalePanda.\" Or, if you’d like a more edgy username, you might try \"KillerPanda.” Try using two favorites from different categories.

You’ll probably have to tack on a number, though, since there are a lot of usernames with things like “swimmer” or “beautyguru” in them. One way to do this is to use your pastime in conjunction with your birth year—for example, \"jennyrockclimber86\" or \"fictionauthor91.\" If you’d prefer not to use your birth year for privacy or security purposes, choose another memorable set of digits. For instance, if you’ll always remember that you did your first stand-up comedy routine in 2014, you might become “OpenMic14.”"

If you really want to protect your privacy, you may want to avoid using your name altogether. Try using a pseudonym instead. Do you want your job or occupation to be known? Things that you discuss online can reflect poorly on your employer as well as yourself. If you are known for discussing controversial topics, you may want to keep your employment and occupation private. Do you want people to know about your spouse or kids? If both you and your spouse are active online, you may feel more comfortable talking about your spouse online and including them in your profile. However, it's best to avoid including pictures of your children or letting it be known that you have children. Especially if your children are minors. You may want to avoid using terms like \"Mom,\" \"Dad,\" or \"Grandma\" in your username. Do you want to be completely anonymous? If you want to be completely anonymous, you should avoid using your name, occupation, and location in any part of your username.

In a “cascade effect” attack, a hacker uses info gained from one account to guess their way into other accounts. At the very least, you should use a different username for different account types.
