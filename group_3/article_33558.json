      "content": "Download or purchase a tuner. Before you play the kalimba, you must make sure it’s in tune or it won’t sound right. You can download a simple tuning app on your phone or you can purchase a digital guitar tuner. Once you have the tuner, turn it on and place it next to your kalimba. [1] X Research source Popular tuning apps include VITALtuner, Cleartune, and iStrobosoft. [2] X Research source You can purchase a guitar tuner online or at a music store. Digital guitar tuners will cost anywhere from $10-$40."

      "content": "Refer to a kalimba key chart to determine the proper notes. The tines are the long metal pieces that run from the top to the bottom of the kalimba. Most kalimbas will come with a key chart that outlines which notes correspond with which tine and some kalimbas even have the notes engraved on the tines themselves. If you don't have a key chart, look online to find one that matches your kalimba. For example, if your kalimba has 8 tines, look for tunings for kalimbas with 8 tines. Starter kalimbas usually come with 8 notes or 8 tines. More advanced kalimbas come with 12 notes or 12 tines."

      "content": "Hit the center tine and look at the note on the tuner. Find the center tine and pluck it with your fingernail while looking at the tuner. The tine should vibrate and a note should ring out. [3] X Research source Tines are like the keys on a piano. On most 8-tine kalimbas, the center tine will be a C note. The center note is usually a G or C on a 12-note kalimba."

      "content": "Tap the tine upward with a tuning hammer if the note is flat. A kalimba tuning hammer is a small metal hammer that can be purchased online. Lightly tap the bottom end of the tine upward to raise the note. Pluck it again and see what note it is. Keep tapping and readjusting it until it is the correct note. [4] X Research source For example, f you’re using an 8-tine kalimba and the tuner reads C♭ or B, that means the note is flat and the tine needs to be repositioned. You don’t have to use a lot of force when tapping the tine. Do it very lightly to make slight adjustments."

      "title": "Tap the tine downward with a tuning hammer if the note is sharp.",
      "content": "Tap the tine downward with a tuning hammer if the note is sharp. If the tuner reads ♯, that means the tine is sharp and needs to be lowered. Lightly tap the top of the tine to move it downward. Play the tine again by plucking it to see whether it is in tune. [5] X Research source For example, if you're using an 8-tine kalimba and the center tine reads C♯ or D, it means that the note is sharp and the tine must be lowered."

Place your thumbs on the top of the kalimba and wrap the rest of your fingers behind the kalimba. You can also place the kalimba on a flat surface rather than holding it. [6] X Research source Do not cover the 2 holes on the back of the kalimba when holding it, or it won’t sound right."

Practice hitting the tine with your nail until the note resonates. [7] X Research source When you’re first starting off, this may get painful if you play the kalimba for a long period of time but eventually our fingernails will get used to playing the kalimba if you practice. You can also purchase and use a finger pick instead of using your fingernails."

      "content": "Alternate between both thumbs to hit tines for a progression. Unlike a piano, kalimba notes alternate, fanning out from the center of the instrument. Playing the corresponding tine on the opposite end of the kalimba will play a whole-step, or one full note upward or downward. Experiment with hitting different tines on the left and right of the instrument to play a progression of notes. [8] X Research source For example, on an 8-note kalimba in standard tuning, the tine left of the center is a D and the tine right of the center tine is an E."
