      "content": "Dry the sweater on low heat for 25 minutes, checking it every 6 minutes. The heat will make the fibers tighten up, which causes the garment to shrink. To avoid shrinking your sweater too much, check on it every 6 minutes. [2] X Expert Source Susan Stocker Cleaning Guru Expert Interview. 8 November 2019. Machine-drying a sweater agitates the scales in the wool fibers, which makes the wool become shorter and thicker, causing it to shrink. [3] X Research source"

If it’s too big, put it in the dryer again for 25 minutes and check on it every 6 minutes. If you were checking on it regularly, it shouldn’t have gotten too small. Putting it in the dryer for 25 minutes with other garments will shrink the sweater down 1 size. [4] X Research source Look in the mirror at all angles to see if the sweater fits well. Observe if it feels too tight or is still a little loose where you want it to be form-fitting."

Place your hands firmly on the sweater, and use your fingers to push the material inward. Do this with the whole garment if needed, or just in some areas such as the bust or waist.

[13] X Research source Make sure the sweater is pressed completely flat and symmetrical on a table, so it’s not altered crooked.
