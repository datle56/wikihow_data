Instead, quickly dampen your toothbrush, shut the water off, and go about your business. It’s one of the easiest ways to cut back on your water usage! For every 1 minute your tap is running, you’re pouring 1–2 US gal (3.8–7.6 L) of water down the drain, so this definitely adds up over time. [1] X Research source"

You’ll save a lot of water over time if you stick with short rinses, and you’ll be just as squeaky clean as you normally would after a long shower. [3] X Expert Source Kathryn Kellogg Sustainability Specialist Expert Interview. 28 June 2019. If you’re thinking about switching to baths to conserve water, keep in mind that a bath typically requires 30 gallons (110 L) of water while a short shower will only use 10–25 gallons (38–95 L). An average water heater uses approximately 18% of your home’s energy.

If you have one of those dual-flush toilets, be sure to use the smaller button when getting rid of liquid waste to avoid wasting water. Depending on when your toilet was manufactured, a single flush requires 1–8 gallons (3.8–30.3 L) of water. [6] X Research source That’s a lot of water over time!"

It may not seem like a lot, but a pebble-filled 12 fl oz (0.35 L) water bottle will save 12 fluid ounces (0.35 L) with each flush! [7] X Research source If you flush four times a day, that’ll save you almost 20 gallons (76 L) of water a year! You may stumble across a website or two that suggests using sand instead of pebbles. But if your bag or bottle isn’t airtight and the sand gets into the water, it may mess with your toilet’s flush valve, so we don't advise using sand."
