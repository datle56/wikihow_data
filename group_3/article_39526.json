At home, you can make sure you’re not overeating by placing leftover food in the refrigerator after putting a serving on your plate. You can take control of your portions while eating out by splitting an entree with someone, or only eating half of what is served on the plate and taking the rest home. Store tempting foods out of the way so that you’re not able to access them easily. When you reduce your food intake by eating smaller portions, your body will eventually get used to eating less food."
