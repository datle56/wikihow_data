      "content": "Say \"Ninakupenda\" or \"Nakupenda.\" These are the two ways you can say \"I love you\" in Swahili. \"Ni-\" means \"I,\" and the single word represents the entire sentence in Swahili. \"-kupenda\" means love in Swahili. [1] X Research source Colloquial Swahili speakers will drop the initial prefix \"Ni-\" and simply say \"Nakupenda.\" Either \"Ninakupenda\" or \"Nakupenda\" are both accurate. The shorter version is simply more commonly used by native speakers, similar to how native American speakers might more frequently say \"bye\" instead of \"goodbye.\" Other translations of \"Ninakupenda\" and \"Nakupenda\" are \"affirmation of romantic feeling\" and \"affirmation of affection or deep caring.\" [2] X Research source The phrase can be used with a lover or spouse or a family member."

      "content": "Say \"Nakupenda sana\" or \"Ninakupenda sana.\" These phrases both mean \"I love you very much.\" Sometimes you want to emphasize how much you love someone or use other terms of endearment. There are many different ways you can do this in Swahili. [3] X Research source To call someone \"my love,\" say, \"mpenzi wangu.\" To say, \"I love you too,\" say, \"Ninakupenda pia.\" [4] X Research source To say, \"I love you, my angel,\" say, \"Ninakupenda malaika wangu.\""

      "content": "Don't repeat pronouns. Some sites on the Internet will steer you incorrectly. The shorter version is the correct one. All you need to learn is a single word: Ninakupenda (or Nakupenda). [5] X Research source Some sites don't understand that in Swahili the prefix \"Ni-\" is the subject \"I.\" Thus, you don't need to say \"Mimi ninakupenda wewe\" because it literally means \"I I you love you\" with the \"I\" repeated twice. That's silly."

The correct pronunciation is \"Nah-koo-PEND-ah.\" The correct pronunciation of the less colloquial version of \"I love you\" is \"Nee-nah-koo-PEND-ah.\" [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Learn how to pronounce Swahili vowels. There are just five vowels in the Swahili language: a, e, i, o, and u. The vowels are pronounced the same way they are pronounced in Japanese, Italian, and Spanish. This is important to understand if you are using another term of endearment. [7] X Research source For example, \"Ninakupenda pia\" is pronounced \"Nee-nah-koo-PEND-ah pee-ah.\" A is pronounced \"ah\" (like \"father\") E is pronounced \"eh\" (like \"egg\") I is pronounced \"ee\" (like \"tree\") O is pronounced \"oh\" (like \"oval\") U is pronounced \"oo\" (like \"room\") There are no silent vowels in Swahili. You must pronounce each vowel in a sentence. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Learn how to pronounce consonants in Swahili. There are many consonants in Swahili that are pronounced the same way as they are pronounced in the English language. [9] X Research source The letters \"n\" and \"m\" are pronounced the same way they are pronounced in English. The difference is that, in Swahili, sometimes another consonant will follow the \"n,\" and it also must be pronounced. For example, \"Ndugu\" is a word that means relative. Consonants pronounced the same way they are pronounced in English include the letters p, s, t, v, w, y, and z. Understand how to pronounce consonant pairings. For example, \"ch\" is pronounced like the \"ch\" in \"chair.\" And \"sh\" is pronounced like the \"sh\" in \"shut.\" \"Gh\" can be pronounced with a hard \"g\" as in the English word \"garden.\""

      "content": "Learn how verbs work in Swahili. Unlike English, Swahili verbs include both the subject and the tense. Figuring out a little bit about how the Swahili language works conceptually will help you say \"I love you\" properly. [10] X Research source For example, the word \"Ninakula\" is actually a complete sentence which means \"I am eating\" in Swahili. \"Ni-\" is the portion of the word that indicates the subject of the sentence: \"I.\" That's why the English phrase \"I love you\" is also just a single word in Swahili. As another example, the way you say \"I don't need\" to indicate you don't want to buy something is simply, \"Sihitaji.\" To say \"I am lost,\" you say, \"Nimepotea.\""

      "title": "Realize that Swahili doesn't have gender preferences built into its language.",
      "content": "Realize that Swahili doesn't have gender preferences built into its language. Pronouns are the same in the language for all genders. So, you say \"I love you\" the same way to a man as you would say the phrase to a woman. This means there are not different words used for he, him, she or her. The prefix \"a-\" is used for \"he\" or \"she\" alike. Swahili was ahead of the curve in this respect. The language is essentially gender neutral."
