      "title": "Scoop out the vomit with a spoon or spatula as soon as possible.",
      "content": "Scoop out the vomit with a spoon or spatula as soon as possible. Start cleaning up the vomit as soon as you’re able so it doesn’t soak into your upholstery, or else it will be more difficult to remove. Use a metal spoon or spatula to scoop out the largest chunks of the vomit and put them in a resealable plastic bag. Try to get as much of the vomit as you can off of your vehicle’s interior. [1] X Research source Be careful not to push the vomit deeper into upholstery or carpet since you could trap odors and bacteria. If the vomit is on the vehicle’s floor mats, remove them right away so the odor doesn’t stay in your vehicle. Wear rubber gloves so you don’t come into contact with any of the vomit."

      "title": "Blot up as much of the liquid as you can with paper towels.",
      "content": "Blot up as much of the liquid as you can with paper towels. After you clean up the solid chunks of vomit, lightly dab the area with a paper towel to lift up liquid that soaked into the fabric. Don’t push any harder than you need to or else the bacteria will get deeper in the upholstery. Continue blotting the area until the paper towels aren’t wet anymore. [2] X Research source Blot around the seams of leather interiors so you don’t work the vomit further into the fabric."

      "title": "Spread baking soda over fabric upholstery and let it sit for at least 30 minutes.",
      "content": "Spread baking soda over fabric upholstery and let it sit for at least 30 minutes. Baking soda neutralizes odors and lifts up moisture from your vehicle’s carpet. Cover the area completely with a generous layer of baking soda and leave it alone for at least 30 minutes. After that, use a vacuum to suck up the baking soda. [3] X Research source Don’t use baking soda on leather upholstery since it will not absorb moisture or odors as well. You can also leave the baking soda on the vomit overnight if you’re able. Having the baking soda on longer can help pull more moisture and odor out."

      "title": "Use a baking soda and water solution on leather upholstery.",
      "content": "Use a baking soda and water solution on leather upholstery. Mix a solution that’s 3 parts warm water and 1 part baking soda until it forms a thin paste. Scoop the baking soda solution onto the area and work it into the leather with a cleaning rag. Work in small circles over the leather, and pay close attention to the seams since vomit could be stuck there. [4] X Research source You can also use a stiff-bristled scrub brush to get a deeper clean."

      "title": "Clean carpets with a water and vinegar solution.",
      "content": "Clean carpets with a water and vinegar solution. Mix together a solution that has 8 parts warm water, 1 part distilled white vinegar, and 1-2 drops of liquid dish soap. Work the solution into carpet or fabric upholstery in your vehicle with a cleaning rag or a stiff-bristled scrub brush. Work in circles so you can get deep into the carpet and remove any odors. [5] X Research source You can also use the vinegar solution to clean vinyl upholstery. Your vehicle may smell like vinegar for a little while after you clean with it. The vomit smell will be stronger when you start cleaning, but that’s only because you’re working it out of the fabric."

      "title": "Wipe the area with a damp cloth to remove the cleaning solution.",
      "content": "Wipe the area with a damp cloth to remove the cleaning solution. Once you scrub your upholstery, wet a cleaning cloth with warm water and wipe the spot. Continue working the clean water into the area where the vomit was to rinse away the cleaning solution. [6] X Research source Don’t pour water directly onto the area since it can spread the odor and make the problem worse."

      "title": "Open your doors or windows so the car can dry completely.",
      "content": "Open your doors or windows so the car can dry completely. Keep all of your vehicle’s doors open so the most fresh air can circulate through it if you’re able to. If you can’t safely leave all the doors open, leave the windows open as wide as you can so any residual smell can escape. Let the upholstery dry completely before closing your vehicle. [7] X Research source Keep your windows open the first few times you drive after cleaning to continue circulating the air."

      "title": "Spray antibacterial air fresheners on the area to help mask the odor more.",
      "content": "Spray antibacterial air fresheners on the area to help mask the odor more. Use air fresheners that have antibacterial properties, or else they will only mask the odors temporarily. Apply the air freshener directly on the spot where the vomit was and let it soak into the upholstery. The air fresheners will trap the odors and kill the bacteria that cause them so your vehicle doesn’t smell anymore. [8] X Research source [9] X Expert Source Chad Zani Auto Detailing Expert Expert Interview. 2 October 2019. If spraying the air freshener doesn’t mask the odor enough, unscrew the top if you’re able and pour the liquid directly on the spot."

      "content": "Try a cleaning mixture of club soda and vinegar to lift the odors out. Mix equal parts of club soda and white distilled vinegar until they’re thoroughly combined. Apply the solution to the area with a cleaning rag so the fabric is completely saturated. Leave the solution to sit for 1 hour before soaking it up with a dry cleaning cloth. [10] X Research source You can use a vinegar and club soda solution on leather, carpet, or cloth upholstery."

Pour the enzymatic cleaner onto the area that smells and let it soak into the fabric for about 1 hour or whatever the package’s instructions specify. Blot the cleaner with a cleaning rag until the spot is dry. [12] X Research source Enzymatic cleaners work best with carpet or fabric. You can buy enzymatic cleaners from drugstores. You can also try using a cleaner made for pet urine since it usually contains the same enzymes."
