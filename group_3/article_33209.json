If, however, player2 also has a 2, he/she can immediately play that card (without having to pick up 2 additional cards) and player1 must pick up 4 cards. However, if player1 has another 2 and plays it, player2 must pick up 6 cards. Finally, if player2 has the fourth and final 2 and plays that card, player1 must pick up 8 cards. Eight. Causes the next person to lose their turn. Jack. Allows the player to change to the suite of their choice. When playing, the jack does not need to match the suite currently showing. If you can't lay a card, then take a card off the top of the pile. If you can play it, lay it down immediately. If you place it in your hand, play proceeds to the next player. Announce if your turn leaves you with one card by either saying \"last card\" or by knocking on the table. If you fail to do this, you will need to pick up an extra card on your next turn."
