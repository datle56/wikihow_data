      "content": "Make a list to easily see the name of the state and its matching capital. Use different colors or writing styles to make it more interesting. Try listing as many as you can on your own before referring to a map. Study your completed list often. If actually writing the words is helpful to you, try recreating your list in a variety of ways. For example: from memory, write the listing alphabetically, reverse-alphabetical order, by region, etc. This doesn't have to be done in a traditional listing format. You could try writing the names inside of circles or squares, or sporadically on the paper. The point is just to pay close attention to what you are writing to help you remember."

      "content": "Practice with flashcards so you can study anywhere. Go through a set of flashcards containing the names of states and their capitals. Read or say out loud the name of the state written on the top card, then without looking at the back of the card, say the name of the capital. Turn the card over to see if you were correct! [1] X Research source Do this multiple times until you can go through the entire stack without getting any wrong. Be sure to shuffle the cards around each time before going through the stack. Change it up sometimes by saying the capital first, then flipping the card to see the name of the state. This has helped many people who have tried to memorize their states and capitals. If you are unable to purchase a set of flashcards, you can make your own. Simply use index cards or plain paper cut into smaller pieces. Write the name of the state on one side of the flashcards, and the capital on the backside. (Writing the information also adds a little extra practice!)"

      "content": "Study a map to help give you a visual understanding. Using a poster, book, or even an online image, study the map closely. Pay attention to the location while saying the name of the state and capital out loud. Noting regions and/or surrounding states can help provide additional clues."

      "title": "Use word association to give you a mental image to refer to.",
      "content": "Use word association to give you a mental image to refer to. This technique requires you to create and remember a relationship using two unrelated items. To practice this, you will need to say the name of the state and/or capital, and then think of another word or image that naturally comes to mind. For example, to remember Dover, Delaware you might imagine this: What did Della wear? She wore doe fur. Della + wear = Delaware. Doe + fur = Dover. The book, The Little Man in the Map Teaches the State Capitals written by E. Andrew Martonyi is full of ideas based on this concept."

      "content": "Play catch to stay active while stimulating brain activity. Have a partner pitch or roll you a ball while saying the name of a state, then you say the name of the capital as you pitch or roll the ball back. Continue the play until you get through all 50 states. If you don’t have a partner to play with, try tossing the ball back and forth from your right hand to your left hand while saying the names aloud. Make it more challenging by using a red ball for the state, and a blue ball for the capital, and saying the name of whichever ball is thrown to you first. (Any colors will work if you don't have red and blue.)"

Say the name of the state and the capital as you put the puzzle piece in place. Look at the puzzle piece upside down and try to guess the capital and state based on the shape. This will add a fun variation and extra practice. Puzzles stimulate brain activity and can help you better remember the location of the states. [2] X Research source"

Try this out while you are in the car or cleaning the house. For a fun, upbeat song, try “The 50 States and Capitals Song” by Silly School Songs.
