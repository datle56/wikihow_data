Change the water once a day by dumping out the old water and refilling it with fresh water. [2] X Research source This will help keep mold from forming. Soaking the seed will let the seed coat absorb the water and prepare it for the germination process. Toss out any seeds that float to the top of the water. You only want to use seeds that sink to the bottom of the container."

Lightly water the soil so it’s moist and then plant the seeds so half of each seed is exposed. Cover the exposed part of the seed with sand. Cover the pots with plastic wrap and place them somewhere with indirect sunlight that has a temperature of around 70 °F (21 °C).

[6] X Research source You may also want to purchase a dish to rest the pot or container on and help catch any drips. You should start with a smaller pot at first, but keep in mind that you’ll need to transplant to a larger pot as the plant grows."

[7] X Research source Use a palm or cactus mix, which usually includes a good mix of soil, sand, vermiculite, perlite, and peat moss to regulate the soil’s moisture and drainage. Don’t pack the soil down. It will need to be loose for proper drainage. You could also add vermiculite or sand to normal potting soil in a 1:4 or 1:3 ratio."

If the dirt feels moist, then the plant still has enough moisture and you should wait to water it. If the soil feels dry, pour some water over evenly over the dirt’s surface. [10] X Research source It’s better to water plants when they need it, rather than on a set schedule. Generally speaking, though, date palm plants will need to be watered about once a week.

Once you notice that the plant is outgrowing its current pot or growing roots out of the bottom of the pot, you’ll need to move it to a bigger pot. Keep doing this throughout the plant’s life as it keeps growing. Always water the plant well before and after transplanting it into a new pot.

Make sure to keep it in a spot with maximum sun exposure. If necessary, you can also keep it indoors in a large pot near a sunny window. However, keep in mind that this will severely hinder its growth. If you live in a warm enough climate, you can also transplant the date palm into the ground outside."

As long as you live in a warm enough climate, you can move your date palm plant outdoors and plant it in the ground.
