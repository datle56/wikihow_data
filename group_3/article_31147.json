[3] X Research source You could also get a budgeting app that does the math for you, such as Mint or Empower . Every month, write down how much you’ll earn and how much you’d like to spend.

Here are some ways that you can boost your credit score right now: [5] X Research source Apply for a secured credit card, which requires you to make a refundable security deposit, and the amount you pay determines your credit limit. You can boost your credit score by repaying what you put on this card. Pay off your credit card debt in full each month. Avoid hitting the total limit, or it could bring down your credit score. Instead, using your card to make small purchases like buying gas or groceries and paying it off quickly can help increase your credit score. Become an authorized user on a family member or friend’s credit card so you can benefit from the primary account holder’s credit and establish your own credit history. Aim to get a credit score above 620 before you move out to help get your rental application approved and prevent you from paying more upfront."
