You may notice some yellowish discharge coming from the penis, although it may also be grayish. Any unusual or unexplained discharge may be a sign of an STD.

However, men are far less likely than women to experience symptoms. About 70% of infected people experience no symptoms at all, so you should get tested for STDs regularly even if things seem fine.

      "content": "Ask sexual partners about their status, if possible. If you have regular contact with past sexual partners, ask them about their status. This may be awkward, but the best way to know if you're at risk is knowing whether previous partners have experienced symptoms of or tested positive for trichomoniasis. It is a highly contagious STD.

You may be at increased risk if any of the following are true for you: You've had multiple sexual partners. You have a history of having other sexually transmitted infections.

      "content": "Get an STD test. You should see a doctor if you believe you're at risk for trichomoniasis. He or she can perform a routine STD test to check for the condition. [9] X Research source Your health care provider will take a swab of your urethra and send it to a lab for testing. It may be painful to urinate after a swab is taken. It may take a few days before results are ready and may even take up to a week if the lab is busy. [10] X Research source Many labs can perform a urine test for multiple common STDs, such as gonorrhea, chlamydia, and trichomoniasis. As the symptoms of many other common STDs are similar to those of trichomoniasis, it's a good idea to get a full panel test. Also, if you're worried you're at risk because you've had unprotected sex you'll be at risk for other infections as well. You should wait two to three weeks after a sexual encounter before getting tested, however, as it will take a while for viruses to be detectable.
