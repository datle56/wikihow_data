      "content": "Stuff your dress with acid-free tissue paper if packing a wedding dress. To keep the shape of your wedding gown, crumple up acid-free tissue paper, and place it inside the body and bust of your dress. For extra protection, place your tissue paper inside of large plastic ziplock bags before you stuff your dress. This maintains the shape as you travel, so you don’t have to worry about your dress getting crushed or condensed. You can also do this if you are packing a formal gown. Do this for all wedding gowns. If your formal dress is not made with a structured bodice, then you may not need to pack it in a garment bag."
