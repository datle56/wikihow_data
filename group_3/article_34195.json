They're most common around the ears and the back of the neck, and feed off of human blood. Nits are much more noticeable on darker-colored hair but lice is more noticeable on lighter hair. [1] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source The most common symptom of head lice is itchiness in and around the back of the neck. In many children, lice don't produce any symptoms until weeks or months after they've moved in.

Instead, be aware of anyone who may have had lice or is being treated. Knowledge is power. If somebody had lice and was treated, but it has not been two weeks since their treatment, make sure you try to avoid contact with any of their fabrics. You don't have to be afraid of them, but casually avoid situations which involve contact with them, especially head-to-head contact."
