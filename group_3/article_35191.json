      "title": "Buy a set of rune stones at a local occult shop or online.",
      "content": "Buy a set of rune stones at a local occult shop or online. Rune stones are usually sold in sets of 24-33 stones that are all the same size and shape. The stones are made of wood or stone and will have symbols printed on them. The stones should also come with a cloth bag that you can use during the reading and to store the stones when you are not using them. [1] X Research source Rune stones made of stone may be more expensive than stones made of wood, depending on where you buy them from. The material is more about your own personal preference, as either material will work well for the reading. Some rune sets are made of crystals, such as rose quartz or amethyst. You may choose a crystal set if you are drawn to a certain crystal or you feel a crystal speaks to you. Most rune sets will come with a book of instructions that includes the meaning of the symbols on the stones. You may opt for a set with 24-27 stones to start, especially if you are casting for the first time. You can then add more stones to the set as you do more readings."

      "title": "Make your own rune stones out of wood, rock, or crystal.",
      "content": "Make your own rune stones out of wood, rock, or crystal. Get wood pieces that are the same size and shape. You can also use pebbles or small rocks as well as smooth pieces of crystal. Draw the rune symbols on each piece with a marker to make your own set. Making your own rune stones can be a fun project and make you feel more of a connection with the set. [2] X Research source Make sure the material you use is smooth and soft to the touch, as you do not want to cut yourself during the reading."

      "title": "Find a quiet, sunny spot that faces north.",
      "content": "Find a quiet, sunny spot that faces north. Pick an area in your home or yard that is quiet and private. An area with lots of light can create a positive, bright spot for the reading. If possible, make sure you are facing north as this will place you in the direction of the gods of Norse mythology, which can strengthen the power of the reading. Some people prefer to do rune readings at night around midnight, as this is known as the witching hour. Pick a time of day that feels comfortable and calming for you so you are in a positive state when you do the reading."

      "title": "Place a clean, white cloth on a table or on the floor.",
      "content": "Place a clean, white cloth on a table or on the floor. This will act as the rune reading sheet, where you will place the rune stones during the reading. Use a cloth that is big enough to hold several rune stones. Make sure the cloth lies flat on the table or the floor. A white cloth will make it easier for you to read the stones and prevent the stones from getting dirty. If you want to make reading runes a habit, you may invest in a rune reading cloth from an occult store or online. You can then only use this cloth for reading the rune stones."

    {
      "title": "Concentrate on a question or issue.",
      "content": "Concentrate on a question or issue. You can write the question down on a piece of paper and place it in front of you so you can think about it for a moment. You can also say the question aloud or close your eyes and focus on an issue you have questions about. Spend 1-2 minutes focusing on your question or issue so you can then transfer this energy to the stones. For example, you may choose a broad question like, \"What does my future hold?\" or you may ask a specific question like, \"Will I get a promotion in the next week?\" Try to work with 1 question or issue at a time. You can do multiple rune readings if you have more than 1 question or issue youâ€™d like to address."

      "content": "Place the rune stones in a small pouch and mix them up. Put all the stones in the pouch and shake them around in the bag. Focus on the question or issue as you shake them. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Mix the stones on the cloth with your hands if you prefer touching them all.",
      "content": "Mix the stones on the cloth with your hands if you prefer touching them all. Another option is to pour the stones on the cloth and use your hands to mix them around. Keep the stones face down so you do not see any of the symbols."

      "title": "Select 3 rune stones for a simple reading.",
      "content": "Select 3 rune stones for a simple reading. Wait until you feel compelled to pick a stone from the bag or the pile on the cloth. Pick out the stones 1 by 1, flipping them over. Place the first rune stone on the right, the second rune stone in the middle, and the third rune stone on the left-hand side."

      "title": "Pick 5 rune stones for a more detailed reading.",
      "content": "Pick 5 rune stones for a more detailed reading. Pick them 1 at a time and flip them over as you position them on the cloth. Place the first rune stone in the middle. The other 4 stones will then form a cross shape around the middle stone. [4] X Research source Put the second rune stone to the left of the center stone and the third rune stone on the top of the middle stone. The fourth rune stone should be placed underneath the middle stone and the fifth stone should be placed to the right of the middle stone."

      "title": "Scatter 9 stones on the cloth for a more random reading.",
      "content": "Scatter 9 stones on the cloth for a more random reading. This option is ideal if you would like a broad sense of your spiritual path and your future. Pick 9 stones out of the bag or out of the pile, holding them for 1-2 minutes each. Then, scatter them on the cloth. Notice which stones lie towards the center of the cloth and which ones fall towards the edges. You should also note which stones landed face up and face down."

      "title": "Examine the order of the runes if you did a 3 stone draw.",
      "content": "Examine the order of the runes if you did a 3 stone draw. Look at the first rune that you placed on the right. It represents your current situation or question. The second rune in the middle represents a challenge or issue you must address. The third rune on the left hand side represents an action or decision you can make to address the challenge. Look up the symbol on the rune to better understand its meaning. Check online for a list of rune symbols or look at the guide in the instructional booklet that came with the rune set. For example, if you are trying to answer the question, \"Will I get a promotion?\" you may get a first rune stone that interprets your current job situation. The second stone will then present a challenge or issue at work you need to address to bring you closer to the promotion. The third rune will then present a possible solution to your issue at work."

      "title": "Check the order of the runes if you performed a 5 stone draw.",
      "content": "Check the order of the runes if you performed a 5 stone draw. Check the 3 runes that run horizontally (the first rune, the second rune, and the fifth rune) to determine your past, present, and future. The rune below the center rune represents a problem or issue you need to address. The rune above the center rune represents a possible solution to your problem or issue. For example, if you have an issue with your parents at home, you may recognize details of your past, present, and future experiences with them in the symbols on the horizontal runes. You may then notice the rune below the center shows a problem you are having at home with your parents. Look to the rune above the center for a possible solution to the issue with your parents so you can move on."

      "title": "Look at the rune in the center to assess your current life if you did the scatter method.",
      "content": "Look at the rune in the center to assess your current life if you did the scatter method. Look at the rune that landed in the center when you scattered them. The center stone can usually tell you about the state of your current situation or where you are in the present. Meditate on what the rune symbol means to you when you think about any questions or issues you are dealing with in the present. [5] X Research source For example, maybe you are thinking about how you can address a relationship problem you are having with your partner. The rune symbol in the center may help you better understand this problem."

      "title": "Check the runes that are face down to determine your future.",
      "content": "Check the runes that are face down to determine your future. Rune stones that landed face down when you scattered the stones are hidden to you and relate to a time you cannot see yet. Flip over these runes and look up the symbols to determine what your future may hold. [6] X Research source For example, you may realize that your future does not predict you still being with your current partner due to the symbols represented on the stones. As the stones are predicting your future, you may not be 100% sure what they all mean even when you look up the symbols. Over time, the symbols may make more sense to you."

      "content": "Look at the runes on the edges to determine the outside influences in your life. Any rune stones that landed on the edges when you scattered them are representative of people or events that are influencing your actions or thoughts. [7] X Research source The outside influence can be a positive force and help you achieve a goal or aspiration. For example, there may be a person who is a positive outside influence that will help you get you move past your current relationship. In some cases, it may be a negative influence that is bringing you down or that you need to address to move on. For example, you may have someone close to you who is making it hard for you to move on from the relationship."
