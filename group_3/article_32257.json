      "content": "Choose acrylic paints for long-lasting, bold colors. Acrylic paint works best for painting a leather jacket. Avoid oil-based, watercolor, or fabric paints since these may not show up on the jacket and are likely to run. Find acrylic paint in a variety of colors at your local craft supply store. If possible, get an acrylic paint that is specially made for leather, such as Angelus paint. This will help to ensure that the paint will stay put, even if you wear the jacket out in the rain or need to wipe it off with a wet rag to clean it. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Select spray paint for an all-over color or to create stencil designs.",
      "content": "Select spray paint for an all-over color or to create stencil designs. Spray paint also works well on leather jackets. However, since spray paint covers a large surface area, this option is best for creating an all-over painted look. Or, use spray paint to add a stencil message or design onto a large part of the jacket, such as the back of the jacket. [2] X Research source For example, spray paint a white leather jacket with grey, orange, or pink spray paint to change the color. Or, place stencils on the back of the jacket and spray paint onto the stencil to create a message or design."

      "content": "Create designs on leather with a metallic permanent marker. While other colors of permanent marker will not show up on a leather jacket, a metallic permanent marker will show up. This is a great way to add bold designs to your jacket and to create precision lines. Some people may also find it easier than painting the jacket. Try writing a message or drawing a design using gold, copper, or silver permanent marker. Use the metallic marker anywhere on the jacket, such as the back, collar, sleeves, or cuffs. Keep in mind that fabric markers will not show up on leather. Check your local craft supply store for metallic permanent markers."

      "content": "Wipe the leather with an alcohol pad to clean it. The paint will stick to the surface of a leather jacket better if you remove any coatings, grease, or wax from the outside of the jacket first. Get an alcohol wipe or wet a cotton ball with isopropyl alcohol. Use the pad or ball to wipe the surface of the jacket where you plan to paint. [3] X Research source Repeat this a few times to ensure that all of the coating has been removed."

      "title": "Use a piece of fine sandpaper to remove tough coatings.",
      "content": "Use a piece of fine sandpaper to remove tough coatings. If the outside of your jacket still looks or feels like it has coating on it, such as if it has a noticeable sheen when the light hits it, then buff it with a piece of fine sandpaper. Rub the sandpaper on the area of the jacket you want to paint using small circular motions. Do this for a few minutes and then wipe the surface with a damp paper towel or cloth. [4] X Research source Be careful not to damage the leather as you buff it! Apply gentle pressure and only buff the surface enough to remove the coating."

      "title": "Test the paint on an inner flap of the jacket first.",
      "content": "Test the paint on an inner flap of the jacket first. Before painting the outside of the jacket, test the color of paint you want to use on an interior flap. This will allow you to see how it looks before you commit to having it all over the outside of the jacket. [5] X Research source Keep in mind that some paints may also react with markers, so test some of the marker over a dried patch of paint on the inside of the jacket as well."

      "content": "Add a band name or logo onto the back of the jacket. This is another popular way to customize a leather jacket. If you have a favorite band, paint the band’s name or logo onto the back of the jacket. Then, add designs to accent the name or logo if desired. [7] X Research source For example, if your favorite band is Imagine Dragons, paint the band’s name on the back of the jacket, and then accent it with a lotus flower, since this image often appears on the band’s merchandise. [8] X Research source If you love the Misfits, then write the name using the band’s signature font and add a giant skull beneath it. [9] X Research source"

Another option is to paint the jacket with something that you’d like to get tattooed at some point. Draw the image or ask an artistic friend to draw it for you, then use the design as a guide to create the same image on your leather jacket."

If your nickname is Jo-Jo, include it on the front lapel of the jacket. If you love the saying \"Life is short. Laugh often!\" write this on the back of your jacket."
