It is normal for a child to feel anxious in new situations, but after exposure to the new situation and getting support from parents and peers, they can succeed. SAD interferes with a child’s ability to be social. Children with SAD may do things like avoiding school, not answering questions in class, avoiding parties, etc. [23] X Research source Children who have SAD suffer from an extreme fear of criticism by their peers as well as adults. This fear often interferes with day-to-day activities because children will do things to avoid the anxiety producing situation. Some children will cry, scream, hide, or do other things to avoid an anxiety producing situation. Some children also have physical reactions to anxiety such as shaking, sweating, and shortness of breath. These symptoms must last for more than six months to be considered SAD. Children who are just shy may sometimes try to avoid activities or have mild anxiety about certain situations, but the anxiety is not as extreme or as long lasting as it is with SAD children. Shyness will not interfere with a child’s happiness in the same way that SAD will. [24] X Research source For example, it might be hard for a child to give a book report, but a shy student can still do it when necessary. A child with SAD might refuse to do the assignment due to extreme fear or even skip school to avoid it. This might be misinterpreted as acting out or being a bad student, but the root cause is fear."

They may also refuse or try to get out of participating in events that involve other people, especially in large numbers, such as field trips, play dates, or after-school activities. In severe cases, your child may experience anxiety in seemingly simple social interactions, such as asking a peer to borrow a pencil or answering a question in a store.

Some of the ways you can help your child include teaching your child how to do breathing exercises, helping your child restructure negative thoughts, providing a calming cue, and offering gentle encouragement. Teach your child to calm down by taking slow deep breaths. Show your child how to practice deep breathing and then instruct your child to use this technique any time he or she feels anxious. Help your child restructure his negative thoughts. For example, if your child says something like “I am going to mess up my book report tomorrow!” respond with something like, “If you practice really well, you will have a better idea of how you are going to give your book report and you will do a good job.” Provide your child with a picture to act as a calming cue. For example, if your child is especially nervous about his book report, you can give your child a small picture of yourself and instruct him to hold it near the top of the page. That way, your child can pretend he is just reading the book report to you. Offer gentle encouragement rather than forcing your child to participate in activities that make him or her anxious. For example, if your child is not comfortable with participating in a game with some other children, don’t push him to participate.
