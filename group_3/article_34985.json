If you have 5-8 people, consider using 20 to 30 cups. Place the cups together, creating a tight circle in the middle of the table. [1] X Research source"

The filled cup in the middle is called the “King’s cup” and players only drink it once all the other cups on the table have been consumed or if a person bounces their ping pong ball into it accidentally. [2] X Research source You don’t have to use beer for Rage Cage—you can also use hard seltzer or other beverages with a lower alcohol content. You can also swap the alcohol out for soda to play a sober version."

When they reach “1,” both players pick a cup from the middle, drink the beer inside, and place it on the table, where they try to bounce their ping pong ball from the table into the empty cup.

      "content": "If a player gets passed to before they've gotten the ball in, they get \"stacked.\" Say player 1 bounces the ball into their cup while player 2 directly to their left is still trying to bounce their ball in. Player 1 would then stack their empty cup onto player 2's empty cup. Player 2 then has to stop what they're doing, pass the ball and stack of cups to their left, grab a new cup, drink it, and then continue bouncing in the newly empty cup. Basically, getting stacked means you have to drink! [5] X Research source"

In this version of the game, if you bounce your ball into the cup before the person to your left makes it in, you can slap their cup off the table. They then have to grab another cup from the center, drink it, and continue bouncing the ball into the empty cup. [6] X Research source To make it even harder, you can also make the person collect their slapped cup, drink from a new cup, and stack both together before they can try to bounce their ball inside."

In this variation, 4 or more people form teams of 2 and compete against each other to see who can drink less and stack more cups. Pick a person across the table to be your teammate. The gameplay is the same, but your strategy might change a little bit: If you bounce the ball into your cup on the first try, you might pass your cup and the ball to the person to the left of your teammate to prevent the person to their left from stacking their cup. If your teammate is struggling to bounce their ball into the cup and you have the other cup, you might try to give them more time by bouncing slowly or missing the cup on purpose."

Play the game as normal, and work together to see if you can stack as many cups as possible before the timer ends. Try not to set the timer for less than 20 minutes, especially if you have 5 or more players, and drink non-alcoholic drinks between bouncing to keep your hydration up. [7] X Research source"
