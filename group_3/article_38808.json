      "content": "God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change , the courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference, living one day at a time, enjoying one moment at a time, accepting hardship as the pathway to peace, taking, as He did, this sinful world as it is, not as I would have it, trusting that He will make all things right if I surrender to His will, that I may be reasonably happy in this life, and supremely happy with Him forever in the next. Amen."

      "content": "The exact origins of the Serenity Prayer are uncertain. Some say the prayer was composed by Protestant theologian Reinhold Niebuhr in the early 1930s, while others theorize it could have been written by Aristotle, Saint Thomas Aquinas, or Saint Francis of Assisi. [1] X Research source Former A.A. secretary Nell Wing observes that many popular prayers “consist of three specific ideas, a natural trinity, so to speak,” suggesting that the sentiment of the Serenity Prayer, if not the exact words, is natural, ubiquitous, and therefore, perhaps, originless. In fact, the sentiment of the Serenity Prayer has appeared throughout time and in many different cultures’ writings, including ancient Sanskrit, Egyptian hieroglyphics, and Persian."

      "content": "The prayer was popularized by Alcoholics Anonymous in the 1940s. In 1941, the prayer appeared in an obituary in the New York Herald , and members of AA staff, inspired by the obit, began using the prayer in letters and cards and incorporating it in meetings. As one former member said, “Never had we seen so much AA in so few words.” [2] X Research source The prayer, which was up until now untitled, began to be known as “the AA prayer” because of its strong associations with the group, but by the late ’40s it was called “the Serenity Prayer.”"

      "content": "The Serenity Prayer helps us feel grounded and hopeful. In the face of life’s obstacles, it can be easy to slingshot between feeling utterly powerless to change anything or feeling like you must (and can) control everything. The Serenity Prayer is a reminder that there are some things we will just never be able to control, including other people, but that there are so many things we do have agency over—namely, ourselves. The Serenity Prayer is especially prevalent in addiction and recovery spaces like Alcoholics Anonymous, Narcotics Anonymous, and other 12-step groups because it encourages people to let go of situations beyond their control (including their own past behavior), to accept reality as it is in the present, and to look to the future with hope.

      "content": "No, the Serenity Prayer does not appear in the Bible. However, it is compatible with Biblical theology. The Bible encourages readers to depend on God for guidance and to realize they cannot control everything themselves. [4] X Research source The verses below evoke similar sentiments to the Serenity Prayer: “For everything there is a season, and a time for every purpose under heaven.” Ecclesiastes 3:1 “A person’s steps are directed by the Lord. How, then, can anyone understand their own way?” Proverbs 20:24 “But if any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask of God, who gives to all generously and without reproach, and it will be given to him.” James 1:5 “Be anxious for nothing, but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to God. And the peace of God, which surpasses all comprehension, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.” Philippians 4:6-7"
