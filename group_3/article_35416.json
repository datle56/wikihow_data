Usually, a chalazion forms on the inside of the upper eyelid, but you may notice swelling on the outside of the eyelid, or on your lower eyelid. A chalazion may also cause tearing or blurred vision if it presses against the eyeball. Persistent or recurrent chalazion has to be checked to make sure it is not malignant."

      "content": "Determine if you have a dermoid cyst. [5] X Research source Non-cancerous growths called dermoids can grow all over the body, including the eyelids. Dermoid cysts are themselves benign, but in some cases they can lead to loss of vision, or rupture, causing inflammation. For this reason, your doctor may recommend removing the dermoid. An orbital dermoid looks like a smooth, firm egg-shaped mass found near the bone of the eye socket. A posterior epibulbar dermoid (also known as a dermolipoma) is usually found under the upper eyelid where it meets the eye. It is soft and yellow, and can form to the shape of the eye. There may be some hair sticking out of the mass. A limbal dermoid is a small spot or mass found not on the eyelid, but on the surface of the eye, usually on the cornea (around the iris), or at the border of the cornea and sclera (white of the eye). These are removed in many cases, since they may cause vision problems."
