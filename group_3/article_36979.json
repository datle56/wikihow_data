      "content": "Remove the wheel . If you’ve never removed a wheel before, the easiest method is to use a jack to raise the car, then place the tire iron on the lug nut, turning it counter-clockwise until the lug nut comes off. Repeat this on all of the lug nuts, and then use both arms to pull the wheel toward you and off of the car. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Locate the ball joint and release it using a large (20-24mm) wrench. The ball joint connects the control arm that you’ll be removing to the steering knuckle. It looks like a circular bearing in a socket, a bit like the joint of the human hip. Release the cotter pin and loosen the ball joint nut with the wrench. You can then use a hammer to strike the spindle and release the taper fit, disconnecting the ball joint completely. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Release the sway bar link using a 14-15mm wrench. This link connects the control arm containing the bushing to the sway bar, so you’ll need to remove it. Use the wrench to loosen and remove the link completely. [9] X Research source You may also have to strike the connection with a hammer to release the taper fit, depending on what kind of car you have. If the link does not come off after loosening, try striking it with the hammer."

      "content": "Use a 19-22mm wrench to loosen and remove the control mounting bolts. The bolts may have a nut on the opposite side which will need to be secured with another wrench before removal. Ensure the wrench is securely on the bolt before loosening to avoid rounding the bolt, as it will likely be very tight. [10] X Research source After the bolts are removed, the arm joint will likely be less stable, so you should hold it in position as you are removing the second bolt."

Listen closely, as there will be a popping noise as the bushing moves, and the arm will become loose when the bushing is completely out. [13] X Research source Be careful not to damage the control arm by applying too much pressure with the press."

A ball joint press, or threaded press, will have a cup that matches the size of the bushing. Set up a driver that has the same diameter as the outer shell of the bushing, and use a wrench to operate the screw-jack to push the bushing out of the control arm. [14] X Research source"

This is the most difficult and least effective method for removing the bushing, but if you don’t have a hydraulic or threaded press it will work with some patience. Be careful not to hit the control arm, focusing each strike on the bushing until it flattens enough to be slid out. [15] X Research source You will need a hydraulic press to install the new bushing, so you might be better off waiting until you have access to one."
