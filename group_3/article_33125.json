Each of the 4 decks has a different decorative design on the back of them: a pump, a carriage, a pail, and a plow. Have each player choose one of the decks of cards. [3] X Research source The player will use the same deck of cards for the entire game of Dutch Blitz. If you’re playing a game with only 2 or 3 players, don’t use the spare deck of cards."
