Ice blue perfectly encompasses winter’s striking silvery blue tones, typically used to describe a “cold” character’s stern stare in literature. Glacial and penetrating, icy blue eyes can also be found in the animal kingdom, particularly among certain dog breeds, like Siberian Huskies and Weimaraners. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Caribbean blue Synonymous with ocean blue and turquoise , this shade is a darker shade of bright blue, used to describe the color of a Bahamian beach on a hot August day. Caribbean blue is often featured in vacation brochures to advertise clear waters, white sands, and fun in the sun for the whole family. Caribbean blue eyes can appear to me sparkling or beaming due to their glittering blue color."

      "content": "Aqua Close to Tahitian blue , this is the color of swimming pools. Aqua is very bright, found between blue and green on the color spectrum. This lively hue invokes feelings of clarity and revitalization, and people with aqua eyes tend to have piercing gazes. Aqua eyes may also appear to change color in the light, shimmering back and forth between blue, green, and even hazel. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Gray blue",
      "content": "Gray blue Closely related to steel blue , gray-blue eyes contain a very specific amount of melanin, as there may just be enough to create a medium-thin film on the iris, responsible for creating the gray-blue effect. Gray-blue eyes can appear to change depending on their surroundings, what they’re wearing, and even how they’re feeling since emotions like surprise or joy can cause pupils to dilate and absorb more light."

      "title": "Sapphire",
      "content": "Sapphire On the light-to-dark spectrum, sapphire eyes are some of the darkest shades of blue eyes. This hue is named after the gemstone and is close to purple on the color wheel. This deep jewel tone may not be as distinguishable as some brighter shades, but it still makes for a stunning and mysterious gaze in the eyes of their beholder. The term “sapphire eyes” is sometimes used in literature to describe mystical characters. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Heterochromatic Blue Eyes",
      "content": "Heterochromatic Blue Eyes Heterochromia is a health-neutral condition in which each of your eyes is a different color, ranging from bright blue to dark chocolate brown. One iris may either be a completely different color from the other or present in a different variation of the same color. For example, one eye could be blue while the other is gray, or one eye could be blue while the other appears to be blue-green. [6] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source This condition is most commonly a result of a harmless genetic mutation, although it can occur as a result of certain conditions and syndromes, like nerve damage and Horner syndrome."

      "content": "Yes and no—blue is the 2nd most common eye color, but only 8% of people have it. Statistically, very few people have blue eyes—blue-eyed people account for about 8% of the population, with many of them being in Europe, particularly in Scandinavian countries like Norway and Sweden. When compared to brown eyes (which make up about 80% of the world population), blue eyes seem quite rare, but they’re actually still the second-to-least rare eye color! [7] X Research source About 5% of the population has hazel eyes, making it the third-rarest eye color. Green eyes are the rarest eye color, making up 2% of the population."

      "content": "Blue-eye genetics are more complicated than originally thought. Scientists initially believed that whether a person had blue eyes or not was totally contingent upon their parents. Parents of blue-eyed children were once thought to each possess one recessive blue-eyed gene. However, further research has revealed that eye color is based on how multiple genes work together, not that they’re simply there. [8] X Research source Scientists discovered that there are 16 genetic variations responsible for determining eye color, which is what makes them so difficult to predict— even if their parents share the same eye color!"

      "content": "All blue-eyed people are related. Blue eyes actually didn’t exist until about 10,000 years ago, and scientists can trace all blue eyes back to a single common ancestor. This mutation caused a huge genetic shift, as all eyes were originally believed to be brown. [9] X Research source In 2008, scientists at the University of Copenhagen discovered that the OCA2 gene in that one distant relative is what resulted in the genetic “switch” which shut off the production of melanin. The OCA2 gene accounts for P protein, which is instrumental in producing melanin. This mutation is similar to other ones that dictate specific physical features, like baldness, freckles, and moles, none of which negatively impact a person."

      "content": "About 20% of babies are born with blue eyes. Humans aren’t born with the full extent of melanin that they will later go on to produce, resulting in tons of babies with baby blues. About 20% of babies are born with blue peepers, although their eye color is very likely to change as they get older and melanin production starts up.

After a baby is born, their eyes can change colors for up to three years."

      "title": "Blue eyes play a hand in your health.",
      "content": "Blue eyes play a hand in your health. There are a few health-related pros and cons to having blue eyes. Since people with blue eyes have reduced melanin, they’re also more vulnerable to light and therefore, retinal damage. If you have very light blue eyes, be sure to wear UV-blocking sunglasses to protect your eyes, along with sunscreen to protect your skin, which is likely also sensitive to light due to lack of melanin. [11] X Research source Blue-eyed folks are also more likely to have ocular uveal melanoma, a very rare type of eye cancer. On the bright side, blue eyes are significantly less likely to develop cataracts than their brown-eyed counterparts."

This might seem like a no-brainer, but blue clothes and makeup naturally accent your blue eyes. Darker blues, like navy and sapphire, are associated with tranquility and trustworthiness, while lighter blues, like baby blue and sky blue, can convey innocence and whimsy. No matter which hue you pick, your blue eyes are sure to stand out, even in a sea of blue. [12] X Research source"

      "content": "Opt for jewel-toned makeup or shades with pinkish undertones. Applying jewel-toned eyeshadows, like emerald, ruby, and amethyst, can add depth and mystery to your persona. Your blue-eyed gaze is only further complimented by these bright colors, creating a stunning contrast. For a similar effect, makeup artist Devorah Kuperland recommends pink, mauve, and rose gold eyeshadow palettes to accent blue eyes. Fellow makeup artist, Alicia D’Angelo, loves this look, too, especially for spring and summer. She says, “Shades of pink and purple will give a pastel look against the blue.” A soft pink palette can further enhance the blue in the eyes, resulting in a glamorous and bold look."

      "content": "Use warm metallics in your eye makeup and face-framing accessories. Although this may seem like a surprising choice at first blush, colors like rust orange and gold work beautifully on people with blue eyes. More often than not, blue eyes contain flecks of other colors, and a great metallic eye liner can help make these more subtle shades pop. D'Angelo is a fan of warmer colors as well. She says, “Warm browns and golds will give the eyes a softer and more natural look.” You can also use accessories to help highlight your blue eyes, like gold earrings or an orange scarf ."

      "title": "Opt for neutral eyeshadows that are dark and cool-toned, like beige or gray.",
      "content": "Opt for neutral eyeshadows that are dark and cool-toned, like beige or gray. Lighter neutrals, like beige and cream, can allow your blue eyes to shine in a sophisticated manner. Darker neutrals, like brown and camel, can create a nice contrast against the light blue cool tone of your eyes. Makeup artist Charina Redugerio uses this same technique when applying eyeshadow. “For blue eyes, I like to go in with the grays and a little bit of brown,” she says. “I feel like they bring [the blue] out even more. It looks icier.” D’Angelo agrees with this color combo. She says, “Using cooler tones like grey, silver or shades of blue will bring out the variety of shades in the eye color.”"
