      "content": "Pronounce the “Sio” portion as “Shi” with a soft “ih” sound. For example, the sound is the same as in the word “ship” or “shiver.” [1] X Research source The Irish language has a rule of grammar known as the “caol le caol.” Irish has both broad vowels and narrow vowels. When an S appears next to a vowel like “a” or “o,” it sounds like “Sss,” but when it comes before or after a narrow one like “i,” it sounds like “Sh.” [2] X Research source When you read phonetics , keep in mind that, in Irish, Siobhán has a fada, or accent mark that appears above a vowel. So does Seán, which is why both Seán and Siobhán rhyme with “lawn” instead of “can” when pronounced in Irish or English. [3] X Research source"

It relates to other forms of Joan that include the French Jehanne and Jeanne, and the Hebrew Johanna.

It’s recently been a top 2000 female name in the U.S. and has increased in popularity due to a character named on the HBO series Succession known as Siobhan “Shiv” Roy.

      "title": "Both spellings of Siobhan are correct.",
      "content": "Both spellings of Siobhan are correct. In this case, Siobhán is the original Irish spelling of the name, because it includes a Síneadh fada, which is a long accent. When pronouncing Irish names , the accent on the letter “a” in the Irish spelling of Siobhan emphasizes the pronunciation of the “bh” as “v.” [10] X Research source Celebrity dialect coach Jack Wallace further explains the difference between an Irish accent and a British accent , in that “Irish speakers pronounce \"r\" sounds consistently, just like Americans. For example, the word \"Ireland\" in a standard English accent might be pronounced \"I-r-land,\" whereas in an Irish accent, it would be more like \"I-er-land.\" The vowels also change—for example, in the word \"goat,\" the vowel sound is different in Irish versus British pronunciation.”"
