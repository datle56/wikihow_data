      "content": "Make sure your child is comfortable with the nickname. If she doesn’t understand the concept, explain that a nickname is like an extra name your family (and potentially your close friends) use to show endearment and familiarity. Consider allowing her to pick out a few nicknames she likes—she might be especially fond of the funny ones, or want something cute and animal-themed. Respect your daughter’s preferences for who gets to call her by her nickname. Most people prefer that only close relatives use it, and may get annoyed if family friends or distant relatives try to call them by their nickname."

      "content": "Be prepared for your child to outgrow her nickname. As she gets into her teenage years, your daughter might not want to be called “Bubbles” anymore. Some nicknames feel too childish to grow with a person, while others remain used only by parents. Other nicknames may adapt or change with age. Whatever the case, don’t be too sad if a nickname falls out of use—it means your child is finding their own identity. For example, a girl named Emma may go by Emmy as a child, Em as a teenager, and Emma as an adult."
