The train line isn't important, but the time of day is very important: the time of day must align to the current time in your timezone. [3] X Research source If you try to rob a train at a time that doesn't match what your current time is, you'll miss the train. The time selection and corresponding actual times are as follows: Sunrise - 6 a.m. High Noon - 12 p.m. 4:20PM - 4:20 p.m. Sunset - 6 p.m. Midnight - 12 a.m."

      "content": "Set an alarm a few minutes before you need to rob the train. This is especially important if the next train isn't for a few hours, so you don't forget. For example, if you want to rob the sunset train, set an alarm for 5:58 p.m. to allow yourself enough time to open the app back up and get ready. Once your alarm goes off, go back to the train robbery menu and get your train line and train time selected in the dropdowns, but don't push Rob it until you're ready."

If you did it correctly your character will rob the train and will likely get away with a huge sum of cash (over $5 million and potentially up to $30 million). [4] X Research source If you didn't get the right time (i.e. clicked the button early, waited too long) you'll get a popup message stating that you failed, but you can always try again when the timing is correct. Don't change the time on your phone to get around having to wait. If you attempt this, BitLife can tell that you've done it and your character will die when they try to rob the train."

The reason this ribbon is a bit more difficult to get is because you can get other ribbons instead, even if you've committed a train robbery in your character's life. [6] X Research source The easiest way to get this ribbon is to try and get it specifically. Start any random life in BitLife, then age your character to 18. Don't do anything else of significance in this life, to avoid accidentally getting another ribbon instead. Once your character is 18, rob a train once. You'll need to follow the steps in this article to successfully rob a train. After you've robbed the train, have your character die before they do anything else noteworthy. There are a number of ways to do this, but an easy one is to die by changing the time on your phone and trying to rob a train again. This will result in the death of your character, and you should get the Bandit ribbon easily."
