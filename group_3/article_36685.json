      "content": "Blot the area with an old cloth or paper towel. Avoid rubbing the stain, which could make it bigger. Instead, press a soft and absorbent cloth onto the stain to soak up the excess dye. The dye will ruin the cloth, so you could use paper towels instead. Use a clean part of the cloth or towel each time you blot the fabric to prevent the stain from spreading. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Apply vinegar or rubbing alcohol to the area if the stain persists. If you still see henna dye on the fabric, pour a little distilled white vinegar or rubbing alcohol onto the stain. Let it sit for up to an hour, then launder the item according to the care label. If the item is too big to launder, flush the area with cold water to remove the vinegar or alcohol. If necessary, you could scrub the fabric with the detergent or fabric cleaner again, then rinse it out with cold water."
