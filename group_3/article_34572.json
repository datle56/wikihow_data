      "content": "Choose 4–5 horizontal branches to keep as the main scaffold. Look at the tree from multiple angles and identify 4 or 5 strong branches growing horizontally from the main trunk. Try to select branches that are evenly spaced around the tree, creating a balanced shape. These will be your scaffold branches, and they’ll support any new tree growth. [1] X Research source Supporting branches should come off of your scaffolds, not the main trunk."

      "content": "Remove branches coming from the trunk that aren’t scaffold branches. Cutting away branches from the main trunk is usually a good place to start when you’re pruning. Getting rid of large branches will make it easier to see where you need to make additional cuts. [2] X Research source You’ll probably need to use loppers or even a pruning saw to cut the larger branches coming off the trunk. [3] X Research source Be sure to disinfect your cutting tools with alcohol before you start pruning. Make your cuts about 1 ⁄ 4 cm (0.098 in) from the branch collar. The branch will contract slightly as it heals. Cutting slightly outside of the collar will help the final scar be flush with the rest of the tree. Cut in a smooth motion—gouges and jagged edges leave the tree vulnerable to pests and disease. If you’re cutting a large limb, cut underneath the branch first to keep the branch from tearing the bark as it falls. [4] X Research source Make multiple cuts if you need to."

      "title": "Cut back the suckers.",
      "content": "Cut back the suckers. Suckers are new shoots that come up from the root system around the base of the tree. Cut these all the way to the ground so the tree's energy is directed into the main tree trunk and won't get sapped by the suckers. [5] X Research source Suckers are usually small, so you should be able to use hand pruners to clear them out."

    {
      "title": "Remove branches that are growing toward the center or ground.",
      "content": "Remove branches that are growing toward the center or ground. Only keep branches that grow upward and toward the outside of the tree. If a branch grows in toward the trunk, cut it back all the way. Similarly, remove any branches that are growing down toward the ground—they won’t be very strong and may be prone to breaking once they’re weighed down with fruit. Removing center-facing branches will help encourage your plum to grow outward horizontally, opening up the center for better light and airflow."
    },
    {
      "title": "Cut branches that cross over other branches.",
      "content": "Cut branches that cross over other branches. Crossover branches crowd the tree and prevent sunlight from filtering through the branches. They also inhibit air flow and can leave the tree vulnerable to disease and pests. If two branches are crossing, keep the one that’s strongest, holds the shape of the tree best, or has the most bud clusters. [6] X Research source When two branches touch each other, the friction can rub the bark away, leaving the tree vulnerable to disease."

      "title": "Trim off long, thin branches with only a few buds.",
      "content": "Trim off long, thin branches with only a few buds. These branches don’t tend to be heavy producers, so it’s usually best to remove them completely, especially if they’re growing straight up or don’t suit the shape of the tree. But if a branch is growing horizontally and you want to keep it, cut it back so it has about 3–5 buds, making sure you cut just above an outward-facing bud. If it won't interfere with the shape, you can also prune away larger branches that don't seem to be producing fruit. [7] X Research source Similarly, remove weak branches that won’t be able to support the weight of fruit."

      "title": "Make heading cuts to control the tree’s height.",
      "content": "Make heading cuts to control the tree’s height. Plum trees tend to grow vertically. That can make it hard to harvest all of your fruit when the plums are ready. To make harvesting easier, trim back the tallest branches each year so you can reach the top of the tree—known as heading. If there’s fruit that you can’t harvest, it could attract pests like wasps. The plum tree should be short enough that you can reach the fruit from the ground or standing on a small step-ladder. [8] X Research source By controlling the height, you’ll also encourage horizontal growth, which means more branches will get sunlight—and you’ll get a better fruit yield. You can also use heading cuts to trim back long, thin branches that won’t hold much weight. If you’re leaving part of a branch, look for the buds that are emerging. Choose one that’s facing toward the outside of the tree—new growth will most likely emerge from this point, so this can help encourage outward growth in the future.

      "content": "Prune dead, damaged, and diseased branches as soon as you see them. Branches that are dead or damaged should be cut away so that the tree can stop wasting energy on them. Removing diseased trees can also keep the problem from spreading. [10] X Research source Dead and diseased branches can be removed any time of year, since taking them off won't affect the growth of the tree. Put diseased branches in the trash to dispose of them. Don’t add them to your compost, or the disease could spread to healthy plants."

      "title": "Try to avoid removing too many fruit spurs.",
      "content": "Try to avoid removing too many fruit spurs. Plums grow fruit on tiny branches called spurs that grow on branches that are at least 2 years old. These spurs develop tiny flower clusters that eventually develop into the fruit. When you’re pruning, try to keep the branches that have the most fruit clusters, and work carefully to avoid snapping off the spurs. Keeping the fruit clusters occasionally means that you might keep a fruiting branch you’d otherwise remove. But remember—you can always prune that branch next year if you need to."

      "content": "Prune to create an open, wine-glass shape. Most gardeners prefer to prune plum trees with an open center and a V-shape like a vase or wine glass—narrower at the bottom and wider at the top. A plum tree should also have plenty of space between the branches, allowing fresh air and sunshine to easily penetrate the entire tree. As you’re pruning, keep this ideal shape in mind to help guide you when you’re deciding which branches to cut. [11] X Research source Also, be sure to maintain a balanced shape, even if that means keeping a branch you’d normally prune. If the tree is unbalanced, it could start to lean, especially when it’s heavy with fruit. If there’s a vertical stem growing in the center of the plum tree, most gardeners will cut it back to the point where the scaffold branches emerge. [12] X Research source However, if you’re growing European plums, some gardeners recommend keeping the center branch."

Simply wedge it between the two branches you want to space out. [13] X Research source Remove the spreader once the branch starts to grow in the direction you want. This might take 2–3 months, or longer for more established branches."

Each year, prune the tree to remove any branches that are competing with the main scaffolds, crowding or crossing other branches, or growing into the center of the tree. Also, remove any dead, diseased, or damaged branches.

If you’re mainly pruning new growth, you can remove as much as 60–80% without harming the plant. [17] X Research source But avoid taking more than 1/3 of the tree’s total branches—that can stress the tree and interfere with fruiting. If you need to prune more than 1/3 of the branches—like if you’re renovating a neglected plum tree—make the cuts over several years instead of all at once."

      "content": "Prune in the winter to encourage growth. Dormant pruning is pruning the tree during the late winter, when no new growth is happening and the tree doesn't have any leaves. Pruning while the tree is dormant encourages vibrant growth come spring, and it's less likely to cause damage to the tree than summer pruning. It’s also usually easier to see the shape of the tree during the dormant season. Consider saving some pruning for the summer. If the tree puts too much energy into growing, your fruit yield might be lower the following year. Prune as late in the winter as possible before new growth occurs, since heavy freezes after pruning could damage the tree."

Whereas dormant pruning encourages vibrant spring growth, summer pruning cuts away the tree's energy and limits growth for the season. Pruning too late in the summer can make the tree vulnerable to cold winter temperatures. In the US, don't prune after July to reduce the risk of frost damage to new growth."

Silver leaf is a disease that causes the leaves of a tree to develop a silvery sheen. It’s caused by the fungus Chondrostereum purpureum , which releases its spores during humid weather. These spores can infect trees through a wound, like after pruning or other damage. [18] X Research source The silver leaf fungus prevents water from moving freely through the tree. Eventually, most trees with silver leaf disease will die, although some appear to recover. [19] X Research source"
