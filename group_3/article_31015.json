According to professional hair stylist Martin Nepton, you should “decide how long [you want] the shortest part of the haircut and how long [you want] the longest part of the haircut.” Then, you can ask for a soft, gradual transition in the layers from front to back. Have the sides faded for more contrast, keep them longer for a shaggier style, or add a step (which is a cross between the two). Show your barber reference photos of modern mullet haircuts that have the graduation and styling you like. Do you want the sides faded or more choppy? Are you going to push back the fringe? The key to a flattering haircut is to be clear about what you want!"
