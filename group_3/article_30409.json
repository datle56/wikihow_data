      "content": "The Mandela Effect refers to the phenomenon of a collective false memory. Have you and a friend ever sworn to remember a logo, quote, or image a certain way but then realize it’s not how you remember it? That’s the Mandela Effect! This Effect occurs when a large group of people remember something inaccurately. Most commonly, this occurs with logos, movie dialogue, and song lyrics. [1] X Research source How does the Mandela Effect work? The Mandela Effect occurs when you recall a false memory. Your memory is malleable, meaning it can be easily changed even without you knowing. Memories are stored in the brain with similar memories, and when paired with current and past perceptions, you may recall something that isn’t entirely accurate."

Other people misremembered the same details—some even recalling news coverage! The collective inaccurate memory led Broome down a rabbit hole of false memories, and she coined the phenomenon “The Mandela Effect.” [2] X Research source Since 2009, there have been hundreds of other Mandela Effects discovered and shared, leading people to question their memories and recollection as a society."

      "title": "False memories and confabulation are likely causes of the Mandela Effect.",
      "content": "False memories and confabulation are likely causes of the Mandela Effect. The most scientifically accurate and believable explanation of the Mandela Effect revolves around how your brain processes memories. Neuroscience proves that over time, your memories can jumble together. Memories are categorized and stored in your brain based on similarities. When two or more memories entwine, it can cause a false recollection. Similarly, your brain automatically fills in gaps in memory based on expectations. [3] X Research source For example, say you remember Curious George having a tail even though he never had one. When you think back to this childhood figure, your brain automatically fills in any gaps. Monkeys typically have tails, so your memory is altered based on this expectation. This is called a schema or cognitive schema —an association or collection of basic knowledge or memories. [4] X Research source Confabulation is the falsification of memory when an individual fills in memory gaps with fabrications or falsehoods they believe are true. [5] X Research source Schema theory of false memory has been ruled out as a universal cause for the Mandela Effect based on findings from the University of Chicago; however, it can still explain a collective misinterpretation based on those with similar associations or memories.

Learning new or misleading information before or after an event can change how you remember it. [7] X Research source Priming or the priming effect is when exposure to one thing triggers an immediate connection to something else. For example, if you see the word “doctor,” you’re more likely to recognize the word “nurse” immediately after than something unrelated, like “cat.” [8] X Research source"

Your memories and perceptions are constantly being swayed, whether you’re aware of it or not. False information spreads rapidly online and can quickly turn into societal fact.
