You can also use an electrical sander on the post to get the job done faster. This will give you a smooth, clean surface to work on. If you see any rust on the flag, latch, or hook, be sure to clean it off too."

If it is too windy, dust and debris can get caught in the paint. Paint will dry the fastest on a hot day – but don’t choose a day that’s too hot. Then, the paint twill dry too quickly and you’ll end up with a bad finish."

If you cannot work outdoors, then be sure to leave a window open so that you do not get a headache. If you get a headache while painting at any time, step away from your project and take a back. Return to your project once the headache goes away."

      "content": "Apply spray paint primer to the mailbox. Choose an outdoor quality spray paint primer that is intended for metal. It does not matter what color your use, but a medium grey seems to give you the most neutral base to work on. Hold the can 6 to 8 inches (c to c centimeters) away from the surface, and apply the paint using light, even strokes. Spray using a side-to-side motion. Over lap each stroke by a little bit; this will help prevent any gaps. [3] X Research source If you are planning on painting something that is currently covered up (like the flag) wait until you are completely done priming and painting the mailbox. Paint the entire mailbox first, then open the flap and paint the rim that's normally covered up by the flap. Wait until the paint dries before you close the flap, or it will get glued shut. [4] X Research source If you weren't able to remove the flag, you will have to paint around the flag. Do this by painting the mailbox, then moving the flag, and painting the bare patch that was underneath. [5] X Research source"

[7] X Research source As before, paint the mail box once with the flap closed, and once with the flap open. Never close the flap while the paint is wet, or it will get stuck. If you left the flag on, remember to move the flag up and down as you paint, so that you get the areas under it."

You can match the color to your mailbox, of you can experiment with different colors. For example, if you painted your mailbox white, try painting the latches and hooks black, and the flag a bright red. [9] X Research source If the parts are loose, simply set them down onto a plastic tablecloth or masking paper. Be sure to flip them over so that you can get the back too. If the parts are still on the mailbox, then pull off any painters tape and plastic bags. Make sure that the paint on the mailbox is dry, then wrap the mailbox in masking paper or plastic, but leave the hooks, latches, and flag exposed.

Refer to the label on your paint can for specific drying times. Some paints require only 2 to 4 hours to dry and cure, while others may need anywhere from 6 to 72 hours. Keep in mind that both temperature and humidity levels will affect drying times. Paint will dry faster when the air is dry, and it will dry slower when the air is humid."

If you like animals, you can paint your favorite animal, or animals commonly found in gardens, such as birds, frogs, and squirrels. Paint the mailbox to look like something different, such as a cat, cow, or dog (the flap of the mailbox becomes the mouth). You can even paint it to look like a bus, barn, house, or anything else that has a similar shape."
