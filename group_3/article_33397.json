Add one more face-down card on the four left-most piles, then, deal another card face-up on each pile. From left to right you will have 4 piles of 6 cards, then 6 piles of 5 cards.

The top card in a pile can be moved along with any cards of the same suit that follow it in descending numerical order. [4] X Research source For example, in a run that goes 9 of hearts, 8 of clubs, 7 of clubs, the 7 can move, the 8-7 group can move, but the 9 is “blocked” until the 8 and 7 are taken off of it. When a card or run is under a card that’s the wrong number or suit, it is “blocked” and can’t move. Moveable cards don’t need to be put on cards of the same suit, just in the correct numerical order. So a 5 of hearts can be placed on a 6 of spades (but then the 6 can’t be moved). Place each new card slightly lower than the card you're playing it on so you can still see the value and suit of each previously played card."

[5] X Research source : So for example, “K-Q-J-10-9-8-7-6-5-4-3-2-A” of hearts is one fully built sequence. Always put a card on a card of the same suit if you can. If you put an off suit card down, the card below it is blocked until the top card is removed."

Put any moveable card in a free slot before taking from the stock. Put kings down on available spaces whenever you can. This is the only way to move a king, since it’s the highest card.

In this game, you can move runs of all one color (for example, 3 of spades, 4 of clubs, 5 of clubs). [11] X Research source In this game, cards are “blocked” and can’t move when the card on top of them is the wrong color or in the wrong order. For example, if a 9 of hearts is under an 8 of clubs, the 9 can’t move until the 8 is taken off of it. The only difference is how you move the runs, not how you make them."
