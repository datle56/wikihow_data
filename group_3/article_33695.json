      "content": "Choose a stall where you feel comfortable and private. If a public restroom with multiple stalls is your only choice, make sure that the stall you are in has a functioning lock (the last thing you want is to be interrupted midway through defecating!). Then, if staying clean and avoiding germs is a top priority, choose one of the stalls closest to the door. There is research indicating these are used less frequently, so they are typically cleaner (although this may apply mainly to women’s restrooms). [1] X Research source If you need more privacy or are nervous about pooping in public, scope out a restroom that is not near the entrance or lobby of a building. These will likely have less traffic, and you will have a better chance of being in the restroom by yourself. If you’re pooping at a friend’s house, you might be concerned that someone will overhear your bathroom activities. Try running water in the sink as you use the toilet to create a sound barrier and an increased sense of privacy."

      "content": "Make sure the stall has toilet paper, and bring some wet wipes too. Check to make sure that the stall or room has plenty of toilet paper and that you can easily reach it. Try placing a small amount of toilet paper in the toilet before you poop. This will help you to avoid having an excessive amount of water splash back up as you do your business. Try to carry some hygienic wipes in your pocket or in your purse. You'll find them useful during the cleaning process. Take some paper towels into the stall with you if you can find any. They’ll be more effective than toilet paper if you happen to make a mess outside of the toilet bowl. Clothing tip: If you know that you’ll need to poop standing up in advance, choose your clothing wisely. For women, a skirt would be the easiest option—simply gather it up and hold it around your waist. Gentlemen, avoid wearing your best pair of dress slacks in case of a mess."

      "content": "Squat so you’re hovering above the toilet seat and relieve yourself. You will actually need to poop squatting, not standing straight up. This will help you make sure that you are aiming properly, and help ensure that you hit the toilet. Squatting will also provide stability, so you will be less likely to wobble. [2] X Research source Bend your knees slightly, and lean forward a little bit to squat. You can also try using your hands to spread your cheeks. This might make the process a little faster and easier for you. Plant your feet firmly on the ground to keep your balance. If needed, rest your elbows on your thighs for support. If you can squat deep enough to raise your knees slightly above your hips, you’ll be in an excellent position. To help the poop come out quickly so you’re not holding a squat too long, let your abdomen bulge out as you exhale and relax your anus muscles. Use your abdomen and pelvic floor to push the feces out. [3] X Research source"

It might seem like standing up can stretch out your digestive tract and stimulate a BM, but it’s not so simple. Research shows that moving between sitting, standing, or lying down is more likely to trigger a bowel movement than just choosing one position. Other studies have shown that standing has no effect on helping you to start pooping faster.

Anatomically, squatting straightens out the angle between your rectum and the anus, which makes it easier to go. [9] X Research source To squat properly, place your feet higher than the floor on a stool, a stack of books, yoga blocks, or even the world-famous Squatty Potty . Using an item is better than just pressing into your tippy-toes, which might actually make pooping harder. [10] X Research source Keep your lower back fairly straight and try leaning forward slightly to encourage an easier poo. Some people have success by leaning slightly backward, too. Fun fact: In prehistoric times, squatting to defecate was natural and common until sit-down toilets appeared in 5th century BC Roman cities. [11] X Research source It wasn’t until outhouses (18th century) and flushing toilets (early 1900s) became popular that sitting became the dominant position. [12] X Research source"

      "content": "Why does my toddler only poop standing? There are multiple reasons a toddler might stand to poop before or during potty training. For one, they may not understand what the phrase “Go to the bathroom” means or what a toilet is for yet, so try being more specific with your questions or instructions around potty time. [20] X Research source Second, some toddlers may still be learning what the sensation of “having to go” feels like. This makes them more likely to poop while they’re standing and doing something else. Other children may also not understand what poop really is or that it affects others negatively. If standing poops are a problem, try explaining that it’s unhealthy to poop anywhere besides a toilet. If your toddler seems to be in pain during bowel movements (in any position) or is straining hard, visit a pediatrician for advice."
