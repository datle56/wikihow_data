There can also be multiple judgement lines present at a time and false judgement lines appear in a few beatmaps. When the judgement line and the notes collide, that is your cue to hit them. Hit too early or too late and you will get a \"Bad\" judgement (indicated by the note disappearing with no animation) or \"Miss\". Hit the note perfectly and you will get \"Perfect\" - a gold square with a circle inside of it appears where the note is hit. Hit the note almost perfectly and you will get a \"Good\" - a blue square with a circle inside of it appears where the note is hit."
