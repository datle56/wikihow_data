Oftentimes, it's the cost of a game console that is a major concern. If you can find a PlayStation for a lower cost, your parents may be more willing to buy you one. You should also think about what you want to say to your parents. [1] X Research source You can also sign up for store emails to receive alerts and notifications when stores are having sales. You may want to wait until a console goes on sale to ask your parents about getting a PlayStation. Look around for the best possible price. Think ahead a little bit. You can write down why you want a PlayStation and why you think you deserve it. It can be stressful to ask your parents about a major purchase, so some planning ahead can help. Talk about how you're a responsible student and generally do your chores and follow rules. Explain how you would enjoy having a game console of your own. [2] X Research source"

[3] X Research source Ask if it's a good time to talk first. Even if you don't realize it yourself, your parents may be busy or stressed. Say something like, \"Mom, I want to ask you about something.

It's best to ask, and then explain your reasons. State your case right away. Start the conversation with something like, \"I've been wanting a PlayStation for a long time. Do you think it's something you guys would consider buying for me?\" [5] X Research source Your parents care about you and want to understand you. They probably dislike conflict as much as you do. Therefore, explain why you want the PlayStation. Pick reasons that will appeal to your parents. \"I think it'll be really fun\" may sound like a petty reason. Instead, try saying something like, \"I work hard at school and in my extracurriculars. I think I would benefit from having a new hobby.\" [6] X Research source It may be helpful to assure your parents you'll use the device responsibly. Say something like, \"I promise I'll only play after I'm done with my homework. If you want, I can agree to only play for an hour or two a day.\""

Explain to them ways you'll make sure those concerns do not become an issue. For example, say your parents are worried about the level of violence in video games. Respond with something like, \"I understand why that would be a concern for you. I would be open to allowing you to screen the games I pick. If there's anything you feel is inappropriate, I'll go with a different game.\""

At the end of the day, after finishing my homework, I would like to have something I can use to relax.\" [9] X Research source Do you have anything else that can help you make your case? For example, maybe you have some money saved up. You can say something like, \"I have saved up almost $100 from my birthday money and my allowance. I would be more than willing to put this money towards a PlayStation.\" [10] X Research source You should also think of any potential responses your parents may come up with and think of a counterargument. For example, maybe your mother is the type to worry about you wasting your time with video games. Write something like, \"I know you probably worry about me spending all my time playing video games. If you allowed me to get a PlayStation, I would be happy to have you and Dad decide how long I can use it each day.\" [11] X Research source End the letter respectfully. Thank your parents for taking the time to read it and ask them to get back to you. For example, \"I hope you'll take this all into consideration. Thank you for reading this letter. Let me know what you think. Love, Tara.\" [12] X Research source"
