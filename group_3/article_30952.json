Although you can find Mirage Island in zones 1-6, your chances are best in zone 5 since Sea Events spawn more frequently as you increase zones. [1] X Research source Update 20 changed how Mirage Island appears; instead of increasing the chances per player on a ship, Mirage Island appears based on the number of ships in an area. Mirage Island despawns if: 15 minutes have passed. The player who spawned the island isn't close. The player who spawned the island leaves."

Don't worry about server-hopping to find better deals! The Advanced Fruit Dealer's stock is the same across servers. The advantages of the Advanced Fruit Dealer are: Minimum of 7 fruits in stock (like Rocket and Spin). Higher chance of Legendary Fruits (Fruits worth more than 1 million). Restock takes 2 hours. This NPC spawns in different locations around the island. [2] X Research source"

You won't be able to continue with the Sealed King quest if you don't have the Mirror Fractal in your inventory."
