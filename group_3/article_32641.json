If you have multiple middle names or your last name is hyphenated, be sure to write down the whole thing. Also include any suffixes like Jr. or Sr. [1] X Research source Even if you’ve changed your name, most Numerologists recommend using your name at birth to determine your personality number. It can help to leave a little space between the letters—so if you were trying to find FDR’s personality number, you would write down F R A N K L I N | D E L A N O | R O O S E V E L T."

In the case of FDR, we would be left with the letters F R N K L N | D L N | R S V L T. If you have a Y in your name, count it as a consonant if it’s used as a hard “Y,” like in “Young” or “Maya,” or if it’s paired with a vowel in the same syllable and doesn’t create another vowel sound, like “Taylor” or “Jayden.” Otherwise, count it as a vowel.

Letters with double digits can be reduced by adding the two numbers together—so J, which is 10, would be 1 + 0, which is 1. [3] X Research source Or, skip the math and use this table to find the numbers for each letter: 1 A J S 2 B K T 3 C L U 4 D M V 5 E N W 6 F O X 7 G P Y 8 H Q Z 9 I R"

[4] X Research source For our example of FDR, here’s what we would have: F R N K L N = 6 + 9 + 5 + 2 + 3 + 5 = 30 D L N = 4 + 3 + 5 = 12 R S V L T = 9 + 1 + 4 + 3 + 2 = 19"

If that’s still a double-digit, add the numbers again until you’ve reduced it to a single number. [5] X Research source For FDR, we’d add: 30 = 3 + 0 = 3 12 = 1 + 2 = 3 19 = 1 + 9 = 10 = 1 + 0 = 1"

If those are a double-digit number, add and reduce them the same way you did before—unless your result is 11, 22, or 33. These are considered Master Numbers, and you wouldn’t reduce them. [6] X Research source In the case of FDR, we’d add 3 + 3 + 1 to get a Personality Number of 7. When you look into the meaning of this number, you can see how his trailblazing leadership style is reflected in #7’s characteristic traits of independence and wisdom."
