There’s a distinct Takbir for Eid, as opposed to the rest of the year, which is: “Allahu akbar, Allahu akbar, La ilaha illallah, Wallahu akbar, Allahu akbar wa lillahil hamd.” [3] X Research source This means “Allah is the greatest, Allah is the greatest, there is no god but Allah. And Allah is the greatest, Allah is the greatest and to Allah belongs all praise.” The Takbir is the name for the Arabic phrase “Allahu akbar,” which means, “Allah is the greatest.”"

      "content": "Follow the imam’s lead for the Eid Salah prayer. Even if you have a general idea for how the Eid Salah will progress, don’t move or speak before the imam has indicated it’s time to do so. Each imam will have their own pacing that they follow, even if the steps are the same. Your imam ill also indicate how many Takbirs will be said during the prayer, so listen closely. [6] X Research source This shows that you are respectful of the imam and that you are focused on the moment. If you’re performing Eid Salah at home, act as your own imam, and conduct the prayer at whatever pace is comfortable for you."

Repeat after him and raise your hands after each utterance. After you raise your hands, put them back down by your sides. The Dua al-Istiftah refers to the opening prayer of the salah. There are different duas to recite, but the most common is: سُبْحَانَكَ اللَّهُمَّ وَبِحَمْدِكَ وَتَبَارَكَ اسْمُكَ وَتَعَالَى جَدُّكَ وَلاَ إِلَهَ غَيْرُكَ (“Subhanaka Allahumma wa bihamdika wa tabarakasmuka, wa ta’ala jadduka wa la ilaha ghairuk”).
