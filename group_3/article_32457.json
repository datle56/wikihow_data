      "title": "Choose which toll road car tag you want.",
      "content": "Choose which toll road car tag you want. Texas has 3 different car tags used to pay for tolls. The tags are all very similar and you only need to get 1 of them. The tag allows you to access most toll roads in Texas. They differ slightly according to activation charges and fees, which you can read about on each agency’s website. [1] X Research source TxTag is available at https://www.txtag.org/txtagstorefront/en/ . Get a TollTag at https://www.ntta.org/custinfo/tolltag/Pages/default.aspx . EZ Tag is available at https://www.hctra.org/ ."

      "title": "Order your tag from a transportation agency.",
      "content": "Order your tag from a transportation agency. The Texas Department of Transportation offers TxTags. TollTag is from the North Texas Tollway Authority in Dallas, and EZ Tag is from the Harris County Toll Road Authority in Austin. You can order the tags online or in person at some stores using cash, a check, or a credit card. [2] X Research source For example, apply for a TxTag at https://www.txtag.org/txtagstorefront/en/ . Find retail stores that sell tags, such as at https://www.hctra.org/HelpAndSupport#ez-tag-store-locations ."

      "title": "Sign up for an online account.",
      "content": "Sign up for an online account. Once you have submitted your tag application, go online to the respective agency’s website. Use the options on the toolbars near the top or left side of the page to open an online account. Submit your license plate and tag number if the agency requires it. Depending on the agency, you may need to wait for your tags to come in the mail first. [3] X Research source You will need to pay a fee, currently $20 to $40 dollars USD, to activate the tag. Your account is what you use to prepay for tolls and handle any fees you incur. Official phone apps are available for each tag."

      "title": "Clean your front windshield off with a glass cleaner.",
      "content": "Clean your front windshield off with a glass cleaner. Once you receive your tag, you have to place it on your car to use it. Spray a liquid class cleaning solution, which you can get from a general store, onto the windshield. Then, wipe the area off with a microfiber cloth. Make sure the windshield is dry before attempting to install the tag."
    },
    {
      "title": "Position the tag behind the rearview mirror.",
      "content": "Position the tag behind the rearview mirror. On most vehicles, the tag needs to be centered behind the rearview mirror. If you have a top-mounted mirror, place the tag about 4 in (10 cm) down from the top of the car. For windshield-mounted mirrors, place the tag 1 ⁄ 2 in (1.3 cm) below the mount. If your vehicle doesn’t have a mirror, the tag is positioned either in the bottom-left corner of the windshield. If you have a motorcycle or the tag doesn’t stick to the windshield, you will need to order a special tag. Read the instructions included with your tag to position it correctly. This information is also available on each transportation agency website."

      "title": "Peel off the adhesive backing and place the tag.",
      "content": "Peel off the adhesive backing and place the tag. Hold the edges of the tag with 1 hand, then peel off the backing with your free hand. Stick the tag to the windshield in the proper location, pressing it flat. Rub your thumb over the tag a few times to push out any air bubbles underneath it. The tag may not stick if the temperature is under 50 °F (10 °C). Use your car’s heater to warm up the windshield first. Removing the tag destroys the chip inside it. You only get 1 shot, so make sure you have it where you want it!"

Deposit money by transferring it from a bank account. Put enough money into the account to cover any potential toll charges you may incur. [4] X Research source Check your account before you travel to make sure it isn’t low on funds. You can usually add money to your account online as well as by calling the transportation agency responsible for the tag. If you don't have a bank account or credit card, you can pay toll charges by mail or by visiting the agency's customer service desk."

      "content": "Set up automatic payments to avoid fees. While you are logged into your account, click on the “AutoPay” option.

      "content": "Drive on a toll road to use the tag. Simply drive towards a toll road. You will see signs informing you which tags are valid for use on the toll road. Cameras installed above the toll booths read your tag and take the toll charges out of your account. [6] X Research source If you do not have enough money in your account, you will get a bill in the mail. You can still drive on toll roads if you don’t have a tag. The cameras will read your license plate instead so the transit authority can send you a bill. If you prefer to make manual payments, you should still make sure you have enough money in your e-tag account."

      "title": "Receive your bill in the mail.",
      "content": "Receive your bill in the mail. Expect your toll bill to arrive within 1 to 2 weeks. The waiting time varies depending on how long it takes the transit authority takes to print and mail your bill. You will have about 30 days to pay your bill before extra fees are tacked onto it. You may get 2 bills if you have an electronic tag, 1 from the agency that manages the tag and another from the regional office that operates the toll road. Toll bills sent through the mail cost about ⅓ more than electronic bills and come with a $1 USD administrative fee."
