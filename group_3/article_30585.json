      "content": "Unload the gun. Open the cylinder and remove any cartridges that are still inside. [1] X Research source Point the gun in a safe direction and cup your left hand around the gun, keeping your fingers clear and away from the muzzle. Push or pull the cylinder release latch on the left side of the gun with your right thumb. Swing the cylinder out to the side of the gun. Slip the middle and ring finger of your left hand through the open frame. Turn the gun so that the muzzle faces up. Close your left thumb and fingers around the cylinder. Strike the ejector rod with the base of your palm one time. That should loosen the ammo sufficiently. Allow gravity to take over and drop the cartridges from inside the cylinder. Check all compartments of the cylinder to verify that the gun is unloaded."

      "title": "Insert a dowel rod into the muzzle.",
      "content": "Insert a dowel rod into the muzzle. Slide the dowel rod into the barrel of the gun until it touches the face or front of the cartridge cylinder. [2] X Research source Use a dowel rod that with a diameter that is smaller than the diameter of the revolver barrel. Do not force the dowel rod into the barrel since doing so can potentially cause damage to the gun. The front face of the cylinder rests just behind the frame of the gun and is the actual start of the barrel. Note that the cylinder is not included in the length of the barrel. When you are unable to push the dowel rod any further into the barrel, it has reached the face of the cartridge cylinder."

      "title": "Mark the dowel rod.",
      "content": "Mark the dowel rod. Once the dowel rod is as deep as it will go, draw a line on the side of the dowel rod at the point where the dowel rod first extends out of the muzzle of the barrel. Use a pen, pencil, or marker to draw this line. Make the line as close to the muzzle as possible. Lie the gun down flat on your working surface as you do this."

      "title": "Remove the dowel rod.",
      "content": "Remove the dowel rod. Carefully slide the dowel rod out of the gun barrel. Lay the gun aside and place the dowel on a flat working surface. When setting the gun aside, make sure that the muzzle points away from you and away from anyone else. Even though you already unloaded the gun, you should always treat a firearm as though it is loaded."

      "title": "Measure the dowel rod.",

      "title": "Unload the gun.",
      "content": "Unload the gun. Eject the magazine and remove any cartridges that are still inside. Hold the gun in your dominant hand and point it in a safe direction. Use your non-dominant hand to press the magazine catch/release latch at the side of the gun. Slide the magazine off with your non-dominant hand or carefully tilt the muzzle of the gun upward until the magazine drops out with the support of gravity."

    {
      "title": "Open and close the slide.",
      "content": "Open and close the slide. Grab the slide with your non-dominant hand and glide it completely to the rear of the gun. Release the slide and allow it to move forward on its own. Repeat the step two or three times. During the last time, pull the slide to the rear and hold it in place. Use the thumb of your dominant hand to push on the slide catch before letting go of the slide. The slide should be locked open and to the rear. Look into the ejection port and down into the magazine well. Make sure that there is no ammo or debris in the magazine well or the chamber. Sweep away any obstructions with one finger. Push the slide forward to close the breech face again."

Always use a dowel rod with a diameter that is smaller than the diameter of the barrel. Do not force the dowel rod into the barrel. Note that the breech face is where the cartridge meets the chamber. The chamber of the gun is included in the barrel measurement, which makes this measurement a little different from that of a revolver. You need to make sure that the dowel rod can reach into both the barrel and the chamber, stopping at the point where the cartridge head seats, where you will normally see the firing pin."

[3] X Research source Point the gun in a safe direction and turn it over. Look for a lever that moves up and down at the receiver. This lever is known as an elevator. Flip the elevator up with your dominant hand while pushing back on the slide with your non-dominant hand. This should eject any round inside the magazine from the bottom of the receiver."

Never force the dowel rod into the barrel. The point at which the cartridge and chamber meet is referred to as the breech face. The cartridge is not included in the barrel measurement, but the chamber will be."

The length of the barrel for this type of gun does not include the length of the entire barrel piece. Instead, the length is a measurement of the distance between the muzzle end of the barrel and the face of the bolt or breech face when that portion of the gun is closed. Close a bolt by pushing it forward and down. Close a non-bolt breech face by pushing the slide forward."

Use a dowel rod with a diameter that is smaller than the diameter of the barrel. If the barrel has a permanent choke tube attached, include that in your length measurement. If it has a removable choke tube attached, remove the choke tube before sliding the dowel into the barrel and do not include the choke tube in your measurement."

Regardless of the instrument you use, keep the line as close to the muzzle as possible. If the gun is not already lying flat on a working surface, you should lay it down while marking the dowel rod. Doing so will likely make the process easier and safer."

Regardless of whether or not you believe the rifle to be unloaded, you should go through the unloading process before attempting to measure the barrel. Note that the measuring process is essentially the same for all rifles, including both bolt-action and semi-automatic rifles. There can be some differences in the unloading process, however. For a bolt-action rifle: Point the gun in a safe direction, supporting the barrel with your dominant hand. Click the bolt upward and back to open it, using your non-dominant hand. Look down into the chamber and into the magazine. If there is any ammo in the gun, carefully slide the bolt into the magazine until it ejects the cartridges. For a semi-automatic rifle: [5] X Research source Point the gun in a safe direction. Locate the magazine release latch at the rear of the magazine cover. Pull the latch back to drop the magazine open. The cartridges inside the magazine should drop out of the bottom."
