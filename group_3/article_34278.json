      "content": "Inspect the system for damage. Check all piping and fittings for any cracks,, or damage, especially if system was shut down over the winter. Check each drain plug to see if it needs re-tightening, and manually operate any valves. Ensure that all nuts, bolts and anchoring fasteners of the pumping system are in place and tightened properly. You should also inspect any safety guards, belts and pulleys that there might be."

      "content": "Prepare a hose that can be connected to an independent water source. Flush the hose to remove any build-up and ensure you have clean water. Run water through it, keeping a constant stream for a few seconds before you shut it off. This is especially important for hoses that aren't routinely used or haven't been used yet this season. [3] X Research source Many people choose to use their garden hose or their washing machine hose connected to their garden hose. However, if your garden hose contains lead, know that you shouldn't drink from it. If you're using this for a well, be sure you have a way of filtering the water before and after it's through the hose."

If you have a water tank that is the steel bladderless type, try leaving the tank drain open at the start of the procedure. This way incoming water can enter the tank by pushing air out of the drain. However, when you see water coming out of the drain, close it."
