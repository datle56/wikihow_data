      "content": "The lowest possible ping is ideal for Fortnite. Under perfect conditions, the lowest possible ping you could have is 1ms. However, this isn't attainable for everyone, so a ping of 50ms or below is generally seen as being good. Ping between 50ms and 150ms can also be acceptable, but once you get a ping of over 150ms you will start noticing lag. However, you may notice the lag before you hit the threshold of 150ms."

      "title": "Use an ethernet cable.",
      "content": "Use an ethernet cable. Ethernet is a faster and more reliable connection than Wi-Fi. If possible, connect your computer or console to your router with a CAT5e or CAT6 ethernet cable . CAT5e and CAT6 are the two fastest categories of ethernet cables and are more than powerful enough to facilitate high internet speeds for gaming."

      "content": "Cut down on your router's traffic. If you're running multiple programs that use the internet on your computer, or there are unused devices accessing the internet in your house (i.e. a smart TV that's turned on but not in use), close those programs or turn off those devices. This will free up more resources, and might improve your ping."

      "title": "Try a different router.",
      "content": "Try a different router. If you have access to another router, try plugging your ethernet cable into that one to see if your existing router is damaged or defective. You can also try plugging your cable right into the modem, if you have a separate unit."

If you can't connect via ethernet and your router is in a spot where it can't evenly spread signal across your home, your device might have a hard time maintaining a decent Wi-Fi connection. Move your router to a central location in your home, ideally up high and in an area free from obstructions. If you live in a very large home, or you have obstructions such as brick walls in your house, you may want to consider investing in a mesh router system if you can't plug directly into ethernet."

      "title": "Try using a VPN.",
      "content": "Try using a VPN. If you live far away from an area with a Fortnite server, using a VPN may help decrease your ping. However, VPNs may not help lower ping at all and may increase it. This is because ping is all about routing, and if the VPN has the same routing problems as your Internet Service Provider (ISP), the VPN won't improve anything. However, if you don't have many other options, a VPN is worth a try."

      "content": "Ping measures latency. It's the length of time it takes a packet to travel from your computer to a server and back, and it's measured in milliseconds (ms). The higher your ping, the longer it took the packet to travel from your computer to the server, which can result in latency if the ping is high enough."
