      "title": "Break the word down into 6 root words.",
      "content": "Break the word down into 6 root words. Split the word like, '\"pneumono-ultra-microscopic-silico-volcano-coniosis\" when you first try to pronounce it so you can work on the individual root words rather than the whole thing. Each root has its own meaning that adds to the definition of the word. [3] X Research source For example, \"pneumono-\" meanings “relating to the lungs.” You can break the word into further roots if you still have trouble pronouncing the larger chunks. For example, you may break down “microscopic” into the roots “micro” and scopic.”"

    {
      "title": "Start by saying “pneumono” as “new-moh-no.”",
      "content": "Start by saying “pneumono” as “new-moh-no.” Remember that the letter P in “pneumono” is silent when you read it out loud. Articulate each syllable of the root so you can sound it out completely. [4] X Research source You may also use the “mah” sound in place of “moh” depending on how you want to pronounce the word. Either form is correct."
    },
    {
      "title": "Say “ultra” like “ull-truh.”",
      "content": "Say “ultra” like “ull-truh.” Put the tip of your tongue against your top teeth when you first start pronouncing the root to help make the “ull” sound. Make sure to use short U- and A-sounds, like the words bug or alone , when you say the root out loud or else you won’t pronounce it correctly. [5] X Research source Even though there is an O before the letter U in the full word, they do not make the “oo” sound since they come from separate roots."

    {
      "title": "Pronounce “microscopic” like “my-kro-skop-ick.”",
      "content": "Pronounce “microscopic” like “my-kro-skop-ick.” Make the first O in word long, like the words bone or low , and the second one short, like the words not or lock . Slowly say each syllable out aloud before combining them together. [6] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Say “silico” like “sill-ih-koh.”",
      "content": "Say “silico” like “sill-ih-koh.” Use the short “ih” sound for each I and the long “oh” sound for the O in the root word. Pronounce the letter C with a hard K-sound, like the words click or catch . Separate each syllable and work through them slowly before putting them together. [7] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Pronounce “volcano” like “vohl-kay-no.”",
      "content": "Pronounce “volcano” like “vohl-kay-no.” Use the long O-sound, like in the words bone or go , at the start and end of the root. Make a long A-sound in the middle of your word, such as the sound from bay or crazy . [8] X Research source The pronunciation of the root is the same as the full word volcano."

      "title": "Finish the word by saying “koh-nee-oh-sis.”",
      "content": "Finish the word by saying “koh-nee-oh-sis.” Make sure to use a hard C-sound, like the words crab or coil , when you start the final root of the word. Rather than an “eye” or “ih” sound, pronounce the first letter I with an “ee” sound. [9] X Research source"

      "title": "Put all of the roots together to say the word.",
      "content": "Put all of the roots together to say the word. Slowly say all of the root words in order, being careful to pronounce each syllable correctly. As you get more comfortable saying the roots together, combine them together and read the full word aloud. Point at the word and follow along with your finger throughout the pronunciation so you don’t miss any parts. [10] X Research source All together, the pronunciation will look like, “new-moh-no-ull-truh-my-kro-skop-ick-sill-ih-koh-vohl-kay-no-koh-nee-oh-sis.”"

When the page with the definition pops up, click the small speaker icon under the word to hear it out loud.
