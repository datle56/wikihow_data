      "content": "Summon Anchor Terrorshark. If you drive the boat with this material in your inventory, there's a chance that Terrorshark will spawn with the Shark Anchor, an awesome legendary sword. You need 5 other players to accompany you. You will see \"Your Monster Magnet has attracted an irregular beast\" on your screen if you have the material in your inventory while sailing Sea Danger Levels 2-6 when the Anchor Terrorshark is summoned. It will have 195,000 health, and the Monster Magnet will disappear from your inventory. If you die from the Anchor Terrorshark, you'll have to craft another Monster Magnet. When you kill the Anchor Terrorshark and you saw the \"Your Monster Magnet has attracted…\" message on your screen, you will have a 100% chance to get the Shark Anchor. However, if someone else is driving a boat with a Monster Magnet, and they see the \"Your Monster Magnet has attracted…\" message, then they will get the Shark Anchor and you won't. If you create the Monster Magnet and don't use it, it will remain in your inventory when you log off and back in. [3] X Research source"
