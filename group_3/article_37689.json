      "title": "Parboil if you prefer a soft texture.",
      "content": "Parboil if you prefer a soft texture. You can skip straight to roasting, but parboiling the parsnips first will help prevent dry or chewy parsnips. To parboil, put whole or halved parsnips in salted, boiling water and cook for 8 minutes or until slightly tender. [1] X Research source Rinse with cold water until they stop steaming, then pat dry. This is more important for mature parsnips more than 1 inch (2.5 cm) in diameter, which have a woody, fibrous core. If you do not plan on parboiling, cut out the cores from large parsnips and discard them. [2] X Research source Parboiling the peel will loosen it and allow you to slide it off by hand. If you did not parboil, leave the peel intact, since the best flavor is right underneath it. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Cut the parsnips into equal pieces. Cut the parsnips into 3 inch (7.5 cm) lengths. Cut pieces from the thicker end into quarters and the skinnier end into halves. [4] X Research source Alternatively, cut into thick batons for a shorter cooking time."

      "title": "Toss with oil and seasoning.",
      "content": "Toss with oil and seasoning. Drizzle the parsnips with olive oil or another vegetable oil. Toss well to coat using clean hands, until the parsnips are fully covered with a light layer of oil. If desired, add salt and pepper to taste, plus your favorite combination of savory herbs. Here are a couple ideas: Rosemary, thyme, and/or crushed garlic. A sprinkle of coriander and cumin. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Spread the parsnips out in a roasting pan.",
      "content": "Spread the parsnips out in a roasting pan. If you are using raw parsnips, a layer of foil over the pan will help retain moisture and prevent dry, shriveled vegetables. There is no need for foil if you parboiled the parsnips."
    },
    {
      "title": "Roast until lightly browned.",
      "content": "Roast until lightly browned. The parsnips are ready when they are browned or lightly caramelized in a few places, but not yet shriveled. This typically takes 45 minutes, or as little as 20 minutes if you parboiled the vegetables first. [6] X Research source Check on them early, since cooking time varies with the size of your pieces. For more even browning, check on the parsnips after 10 or 20 minutes and flip pieces that are sticking to the pan."

      "title": "Serve immediately.",
      "content": "Serve immediately. Like potatoes, parsnips tend to have a dry texture that improves when paired with butter, cream, yogurt, or crème fraîche. [7] X Research source Optionally, toss with fresh herbs that match your seasonings, such as chopped cilantro to go with coriander and cumin. [8] X Research source You can keep the dish warm in an oven on a low setting until the rest of your dinner is prepared. [9] X Research source"

      "title": "Toss in the other ingredients.",
      "content": "Toss in the other ingredients. Mix together roughly 1 part olive oil, 3 parts honey or maple syrup, and a little salt and pepper. (If you prefer exact amounts, measure 1 oz (30 mL) olive oil and 3.5 oz. (80ml) maple syrup or honey for each 2.5 lbs. (1kg) of parsnips.) Pour over the parsnips and toss until they are covered on all sides. If your honey is cloudy and semi-solid, warm it up until it is runny enough to pour. [11] X Research source You can use fake maple syrup, but it may not give the same depth of flavor. Avoid sugar-free substitutes, since you need the sugar to caramelize the parsnips."

      "content": "Roast until tender and golden brown. Depending on the size of your pieces, this can take 20 to 40 minutes. Turn the pieces over once during cooking, once they have browned on one side."
