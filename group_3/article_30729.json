[2] X Research source If you successfully accomplish self-realization, you should be able to feel the divine power sweep over your body in the form of a breeze that passes over your hand and head. It is believed by its practitioners that this experience has been witnessed by hundreds of thousands of people in over ninety countries worldwide."

      "content": "Understand the subtle system. The subtle system is made up of nadis and chakras. Nadis, or channels, carry energy throughout the body while chakras, or “wheels,” are the centers of energy located in the body. There are three primary vertical channels of energy and seven major chakras. This system can only be activated with a Kundalini awakening. The Kundalini awakening simultaneously cleans and balances the system and enlightens and purifies the chakras. [3] X Research source Each chakra has spiritual abilities. The chakras always exist in the body but they do not manifest their full qualities until the Kundalini is awakened. [4] X Expert Source Andrés Alarcón Sahaja Yoga Practitioner Expert Interview. 7 July 2020. When the Kundalini rises and nourishes the chakras, our bodies automatically become dynamic, creative, confident, and very humble."

      "content": "Know the spiritual abilities of the chakras. Chakras are called wheels because this is where the energy spins with frequency, similar to a galaxy of planets spinning on their axis. Chakras are located along the spinal cord region and supervise and maintain the perfect operation of the bodily system. What attracts and disturbs the chakras influences their sensitivity and performance. Self-realization will enlighten the central nervous system, allowing you to feel each of the seven chakras. [5] X Research source The mooladhara, or first chakra, will help you rediscover your innocence, and innate and intuitive wisdom. The second chakra, or swadisthana, will stimulate your creative instincts and establish pure knowledge. [6] X Expert Source Andrés Alarcón Sahaja Yoga Practitioner Expert Interview. 7 July 2020. At the nabhi, third chakra, the realization of your accomplishments will be satisfied and your inner peace will be established within.

Good communication, a sense of perspective, and a balanced approach to stressful situations will be summoned during vishuddhi, or the fifth chakra. At the sixth chakra, or agnya, your forgiveness will allow you to move forward with life without grudges or hatred. You will be able to identify with your freedom and power of your inner self. Finally, the last chakra, sahasrara, will allow you to have a transformative connection that enables you to understand a deeper and truer meaning and purpose to your life."

      "content": "Know the channels, or nadis. There are three main nadis: the left channel (Ida Nadi), also called the “moon channel,” is located along the left side of the body and provides the conduit for the energy of our desire. The right channel (Pingala Nadi), or “sun channel,” runs along the right side of the body and is responsible for active energy, as well as our mental and physical activities. The central channel (Sushumna Nadi) is located along the spine to the highest chakra. [8] X Research source The central channel coordinates the nervous system activities. It is not until the awakening of the Kundalini and its travel through the central channel and out through the top of the head that recognition occurs of the vastness of the subtle system. The left channel represents different qualities and aspects such as the expression of our desires and the past. Here one might collect all one's habits and conditionings. If this channel is obstructed or out of balance, you might feel depressed, sad or lazy. Through the practice of Sahaja Yoga, you might be able to remove all the obstacles on this channel so you can be free from the past. [9] X Expert Source Andrés Alarcón Sahaja Yoga Practitioner Expert Interview. 7 July 2020. The right channel is related with the power of action and the future. If this channel is not in balance, it is easily blinded by ego and can change our behavior to be more aggressive and dominating. The Sahaja Yoga meditation can remove this negativity and restore balance between the channels and the chakras. [10] X Expert Source Andrés Alarcón Sahaja Yoga Practitioner Expert Interview. 7 July 2020. Ask the energy to rise through your central channel to give you self-realization.

Repeat sixteen times to the Kundalini: “Mother, I am not guilty at all.” While placing your right hand on your forehead, bend your head down and say a few times: “Mother, I forgive everyone including myself.” Then, put your right hand on the back of your head, push your head back and say, “Oh, Divine Power, if I have committed any mistakes, please forgive me.” Finally, open your hand fully and press on the fontanelle bone area on top your head. Move it slowly clockwise seven times, moving your scalp in unison with your hand. Each time repeat: Mother, please give me my Self-Realization.\""

      "content": "Conclude the self-realization meditation. After you completed the meditation, take a moment to absorb your environment and to experience your feelings. By the time you finish, your feelings should be relaxed and your thoughts should have disappeared. [16] X Research source This is considered the first step of meditation, or “thoughtless awareness,” when you were completely cognizant without thought, in a pure state of peaceful consciousness. Now that you have reached this stage, you should feel the sensation of the cool breeze on the top of your hands and head. This is the Kundalini energy purifying the chakras in your body. If you fail to experience the breeze, the most likely cause is you did not forgive everybody. Therefore, say “Mother, I forgive everyone” a few times and check for the cool breeze once again."
