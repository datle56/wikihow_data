      "content": "A misaligned SIM card won't work properly. You'll get the network message if the SIM card is inserted wrong. Dropping your Android or jostling it can unseat the SIM card, too. Use a paperclip or thin tool to remove the SIM card tray so you can remove and reinsert the SIM card. Taking it out and putting it back in can also fix your \"No SIM\" error . Not all phones have physical SIM cards, so skip this step if you have a digital SIM card."

      "content": "Switching to a more available network can get rid of the network message. For example, if you're visiting an area with 2G or 3G coverage but are used to getting 5G, you'll most likely get the \"not registered on network\" error message until you switch your phone to use the slower networks. Newer phones like the S21+ may not support this customization. Instead, the switch is supposed to be automatic so your phone will use whatever network offers the strongest connection."
