      "content": "Win by making every shot \"around the world\" before everyone else. Around the World is all about accuracy and consistency when shooting. You set five or more spots in an arc around the basket. Each player gets two shots at each spot. If you make it, you move on to the next one. If you miss two in a row, you start from scratch. The first player all the way around wins. You need at least two players. However, there is no upper limit on the number of people that can play."

      "content": "Select your \"world spots\" before the game starts. You want to make a small half-circle around the basket. If you're new to the game, set it up around the key, the rectangle in front of the goal. If you're experienced you can back up, even setting every spot around the three point line. You want to make a half-circle, representing the world, so that you have to shoot from every angle and on both sides of the basket. However, you should feel free to pick whatever spots you want. Mark them with tape or chalk. [1] X Research source In general, you want your spots evenly spaced out. You can have as many spots as you want, depending on how long you want the game to go on for. Some people like to add the free-throw line as the first and last shot -- your \"home base.\""

If the first person happens to win, everyone else gets one round to try and tie them, forcing a rematch or overtime. Thus, the person who goes first does not matter too much.

If you miss both shots, it is the next person's turn to shoot. Since there is nowhere to go back to on the first shot, there is no reason to skip your second shot. Try bending your kneesâ€”this can help you take a longer shot. [3] X Expert Source Ryan Tremblay Basketball Coach Expert Interview. 13 November 2020."

      "title": "Skip your second shot to stay in place, especially if you're worried about missing.",
      "content": "Skip your second shot to stay in place, especially if you're worried about missing. This is where the strategy comes into play. If you miss two shots in a row, you must start over on your next turn. But if you miss the first one you can skip your next shot. When it is your turn again you get to start from the same spot you left off. If you have a big lead, it is often best to wait. Remember, however, that it only takes one good turn for someone to catch up -- or even win. If you're behind, it might be worth the risk to take your second shot. If you can develop some rhythm, one great round might help you come back."

      "content": "Allow everyone the same number of rounds to shoot. Every player should get the same number of chances to win. Say, for example, you're playing with four people who shoot in the order A, B, C, and D. During the fifth round, player B makes every bucket and wins. However, players C and D only got to play for four rounds. They each get one more chance to win, forcing a playoff. Player A, who got the same number of chances as Player B, loses. For tie-breakers, play one more round. Whatever player gets the furthest around wins."

You can add in the free-throw line, make players go down the line and come back, or make the last shot an extra-difficult 3-pointer. [5] X Research source Make sure everyone understands all of the shots before beginning -- it makes a big difference when deciding whether to move on or stay put for the second shot."

      "title": "Eliminate the second shot for higher stakes games.",
      "content": "Eliminate the second shot for higher stakes games. If you're a great shooter, you should be able to constantly hit every shot under pressure. If you're really looking to improve your game or make things tenser, only allow one shot per spot. You can also eliminate the ability to skip a shot, forcing players to take both shots every time and move back if they fail."

      "content": "Allow simultaneous shooting for a chaotic, strategic game. This is best for smaller groups of 2-4 players, and you may need a referee to ensure it all works out. Start with every player on roughly the same square, say go, and start shooting. The rest of the rules apply as well, except you cannot skip turns. If you miss twice, you start over. Players will have to be strategic about when to shoot, and smart players can even try and hit other players balls to knock them back to start -- though you'll be sacrificing one of your own shots as well. To make it easier to enforce the rules, players should shout \"chance shot\" every time they take a second shot, allowing you to know if they must restart if they miss."

      "title": "Limit the number of skips per game.",
      "content": "Limit the number of skips per game. You could only allow three total skips in the entire game, making them much more strategic and putting a greater focus on good shooting. It can, however, also make the game much longer."

    {
      "title": "Make shooters use both hands.",
      "content": "Make shooters use both hands. This little variation mixes up the normal game and allows for odd and spectacular shots. You can make players alternate arms every shot (making them more or less likely to risk the second shot), or force them to shoot opposite handed whenever they want to take a second shot. You can mix this up with backwards shots or blind, eyes-closed shots as well to make things interesting."
