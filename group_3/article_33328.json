      "content": "Gather 2-4 friends to play with. You can play Pogs with as many people as you like, but it’s best to play with just 2-4 close friends. [1] X Research source If you play with too many people, the game might last too long, or there won’t be very many Pogs left by the time the last players take their turns. If you or your friends don’t have any Pogs, play with old bottle caps or cut-out cardboard discs, which was how the game was first played in the 1930s. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Play for keeps, or play for fun. Before the game starts, decide with your friends if you’ll be playing to keep any Pogs you manage to flip during the game. This ups the stakes and adds some juicy tension to each turn. Otherwise, just play for fun, and return the Pogs to each player afterward. [3] X Research source If you play for keeps and lose some of your favorite Pogs, challenge your friend to a rematch to win them back."

      "content": "Select which Pogs you’ll play with. Make a circle with your friends and take turns placing a Pog into the center. Each player must add the same number of Pogs to the game. [4] X Research source There’s no set number of how many Pogs to use, but about 5-10 Pogs per player is a good number. Once your Pogs are gathered, shuffle them around with your hands to evenly and fairly distribute them in the collection. If you're playing for keeps, remember that any Pogs you put into the stack might not come back to you when you're done. Choose your Pogs carefully!"

      "content": "Stack the Pogs face-up on a flat surface. Gather everyone’s Pogs and arrange them into a single column, stacking each Pog so that the design faces upward. [5] X Research source Stack the Pogs on a flat, sturdy surface, like a table, carpet, or a hard floor."

      "title": "Flip a Pog to see who goes first.",
      "content": "Flip a Pog to see who goes first. Toss an unused Pog like a coin, and have your friend call it in the air—face-up or face-down. The winner of the toss takes the first turn. [6] X Research source If you’re playing with more than 2 people, repeat the coin toss with the winner of the last toss and the next player, repeating until each person has participated. The last toss winner goes first. Alternatively, play Rock, Paper, Scissors to decide who goes first. The first player typically gets the most Pogs out of the slam. It's a lot harder to flip over a very small stack of Pogs."

      "title": "Grip your slammer between your fingers.",
      "content": "Grip your slammer between your fingers. Slammers are heavier, sturdier Pogs that you throw at the stack. In American Pog tournaments, players hold the slammer between their index and middle fingers, and flick it downward over the back of their wrists. [7] X Research source But there are lots of ways to hold the slammer, so experiment with these common techniques to see which is best for you: Hold the slammer flat against the inside of your fingers, and keep it in place with your thumb. Throw it down toward the stack. Curl the slammer into your index finger and hold it with your thumb, like you’re going to skip a stone. Hold the slammer like you would a dart, sideways between your index finger and thumb. Or turn it so the flat side is between your finger and thumb."

Let the slammer go before it makes contact with the stack. Then, collect any Pogs that landed face-down. [8] X Research source After your turn, restack the Pogs and let the next player slam. If you’re playing for keeps, the Pogs you flipped become yours. Add them to your collection!"

Once there are no more Pogs, the player with the most Pogs is the winner. [9] X Research source If you're not playing for keeps, return all the Pogs to their original owners at the end of the game. To even the odds, have every player use the same slammer. Some players outlaw metal slammers, which can dent the Pogs."

      "content": "Play with different rules to mix things up. The basic game of Pogs is pretty simple, so try some different rules if the original game becomes a bit less exciting over time. Make up your own, or try some of these common classics: [10] X Research source Play best of 15 . If someone has a Pog you really want, offer to play more Pogs than them in order to get it. Make a stack of 15, and negotiate how many Pogs you’ll play in order for them to use the Pog you want. You might even play 14 Pogs for a chance to get their 1. Play the Pogs where they fall . After the Pogs scatter, pick up the ones you flipped, but don't restack the others. Instead, aim to slam them where they landed for a bigger challenge. Play long-range Pogs . Instead of throwing the slammer from just above the stack, make a line about 3 ft (0.91 m) away and make each player slam from behind the line to test your aim."

Then use the template to trace circles onto a flat piece of cardboard. Cut out the cardboard circles and draw designs on the top, or glue a printed design to one side. To make the slammer, glue 2 pieces of cardboard together. [11] X Research source Alternatively, collect bottle caps from glass bottles to use as Pogs."

If you play in a big group and everyone only puts in a few Pogs, you don't stand to lose many, but you can gain a bunch pretty quickly."
