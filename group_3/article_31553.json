The “sudo” command is short for “superuser do.” Using this command in Terminal allows you to run commands as the root account, also known as the superuser, without actually logging into your Mac as root. This is the safest way to run apps and other processes as root. However, you’ll need access to an administrator account to do it. [1] X Research source If you aren’t already on an admin account, you can either restart your Mac and log in as an admin, or go to Apple menu > Log Out [your username] and log back in as an administrator. Check out how to set up quick account switching on your Mac . If you don’t want to log into your Mac as an administrator, you can switch to an admin account in Terminal with the command su adminUsername . Replace “adminUsername” with the name of the admin account you want to use. You’ll be prompted to enter the correct password to continue."

If the app name contains spaces, put quotation marks around the entire path to ensure that Terminal recognizes it.

Right-click or Ctrl -click the name of the app and select Show Package Contents . Locate the executable file inside the package and right-click or Ctrl -click it, then press Option while the menu is open.

Keep holding the button during startup until you see a screen that says “Loading startup options” or displays an “Options” icon. Click Options , then click Continue under the Options icon.
