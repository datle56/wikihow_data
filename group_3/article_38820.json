      "content": "Serve sangria from a pitcher or punch bowl. Choose a clear pitcher or punch bowl to showcase the beauty of the sangria. Choose a pitcher or bowl large enough fit an entire bottle of wine and to serve 8 drinks. Fill glasses by pouring them from the pitcher or use a ladle to fill glasses from a punch bowl. A dispenser is not a good choice for serving sangria, as the fruit can clog the spout."

      "title": "Allow it to soak for several hours before serving.",
      "content": "Allow it to soak for several hours before serving. After you make sangria, don’t serve it immediately. Let it sit anywhere from 4 hours to overnight to allow the fruit to soak up the flavors. [1] X Research source However, don’t add any seltzer or sparkling water until you’re ready to serve the sangria."

      "title": "Serve sangria chilled or on the rocks.",
      "content": "Serve sangria chilled or on the rocks. Sangria is best served chilled, so store it in the refrigerator in the serving container while the ingredients are soaking. Alternatively, you can serve it on the rocks by filling glasses with ice before pouring in the sangria. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Put sugar or spices on the rim of the glass.",
      "content": "Put sugar or spices on the rim of the glass. Dip the mouth of a glass in a shallow bowl of water. Then, dip the wet glass in a shallow bowl of sugar or spices that complement the flavors of the sangria. Fill the glass with sangria and enjoy! Spices you could use to rim the glasses include cinnamon, cayenne pepper, cocoa powder, or a mixture of them."

      "title": "Add a fruit or herb garnish to the sangria.",
      "content": "Add a fruit or herb garnish to the sangria. Put cherries, cranberries, or raspberries on a pretty toothpick and stick it in the top of each glass. Alternatively, you could garnish the glasses with citrus slices, a few frozen blueberries, or a sprig of mint."

      "title": "Serve hot sangria from the stovetop or a slow cooker.",
      "content": "Serve hot sangria from the stovetop or a slow cooker. The best way to keep your sangria warm all through the evening is to let it simmer in a slow cooker (or crock pot). You could also allow it to simmer in a large pot or saucepan on the stovetop, if you don’t have a slow cooker. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Choose heat-resistant glasses for serving hot sangria. Rather than getting out your stemware, choose mugs for serving hot sangria. Not only will the mugs keep the sangria warmer than thin glasses, they also have a nice handle for holding on to the hot beverage. [4] X Research source Hot sangria could potentially crack thin glasses, so avoid using these to serve hot sangria."

      "content": "Let hot sangria simmer for 20 to 30 minutes before serving. You want all your spices and flavors to combine nicely, so this is an important step. Though you could simply heat the mixture and serve it, letting it simmer for a bit longer creates a more complex and nuanced flavor. Just be sure to keep the burner or slow cooker on a low setting.

Or use peaches, apples, or pears if you put white wine in your sangria. [9] X Research source Mix and match the fruits and don’t be afraid to choose several!
