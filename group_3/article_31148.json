      "content": "Examine your budget to determine a price range. The first step to moving into your own place is figuring out what you can afford. If you have a job lined up, look at how much you’ll be making and compare it with your expected expenses. Figure out how much you can afford to spend on rent and still have money to spare for other things. A generally good rule is that your annual (yearly) income should be 40 times the monthly rent. For example, if your rent is 550 then you should probably make at least 22,000 a year or more. [1] X Research source Keep in mind that you may need to save a little extra money for the initial move. Most apartments require a security deposit (usually equal to the rent amount). A lot of places also require first month's rent, and sometimes even last month's rent depending on the landlord. You may also need to pay for a moving van or a professional moving service. Some apartments have income requirements for their tenants (e.g., you must earn 3 times the cost of rent each month). If you can’t meet those income requirements, you might be able to get around them by using a cosigner. In addition to rent, common living expenses include transportation costs (e.g., gas and car maintenance), groceries and dining, home utilities (e.g., water, electricity, gas, Internet, and TV), and your phone bill. You may also have other expenses, such as student loan payments or credit card payments."

      "content": "Make a list of qualities you want in an apartment. Not all apartments are created equal. Before you start apartment hunting, think about your needs, and make a list of features you really want or need your new home to have. Prioritize the must-haves, and then make a list of features that you want, but don’t necessarily need. [2] X Research source Consider things like: The monthly rent payment If the utilities are included in the rent The size of the apartment Which floor the apartment is on If the apartment is furnished If the apartment is pet-friendly Parking availability Building security Amenities (e.g., laundry facilities and common areas)"

      "content": "Figure out what you want from your location. In addition to thinking about the apartment itself, you’ll also need to consider the area where your future apartment is located. Write down a few things you want out of your ideal area or neighborhood. For example, do you need to live relatively close to where you’re working or going to school? Do you want to live near amenities like grocery stores or retail outlets? Do you prefer a more urban setting, or something more secluded? Do you want a place that’s bike friendly or has good public transit?"

      "content": "Determine if you want or need a roommate . Renting with a roommate can make your first apartment much more affordable. You can advertise with a website like Craigslist or Roommates.com, or ask around among your friends to find out if they know anyone in the area looking for a roommate. Make a list of qualities you want or don’t want in a roommate. Figure out if you have any deal-breakers before you invite someone to share your home. For example, you might decide that your roommate must be a non-smoker or must be willing to live with a cat."

      "content": "Begin searching as far in advance as possible. It can take a long time to find a place that fits your needs, so don’t start apartment hunting at the last minute. Start your search at least a month before you plan to move. This will give you plenty of time to find and secure an apartment, and also to prepare for the actual move. [3] X Research source Summer (between May and August) is the busiest time for move-ins, so avoid the summer rush by moving at a different time of the year, if you can."

      "content": "Check apartment listings in the area where you want to live. Websites like Rent.com and Apartments.com not only list properties for rent, but help you narrow down your options by filtering for things like location, price, size, pet friendliness, and so on. You can also find apartment listings by: Looking at classifieds websites like Craigslist. Checking the classifieds sections in local newspapers. Looking at for-rent flyers on bulletin boards in local community centers, stores, and college campuses. Asking around among friends and acquaintances who live in the area."

      "content": "Set up a time to view potential apartments. Call the property manager or landlord to make an appointment. Seeing the apartment in person will not only give you an idea of whether you like the place, but can also give you a sense of what the management is like. Bring a list of questions to ask the landlord or property manager (e.g., “Who do I call if something breaks in my apartment?” or “How does trash pickup work?”). If you can, have a chat with another tenant while you’re there. Ask them how they like the place and if they’ve encountered any major problems during their time there."

      "content": "Fill out any required paperwork. Before you can move in to a new apartment, you will have to fill out a few forms. You will likely need to submit to a credit check or background check before you can be approved for a lease, and your new landlord might also ask you to supply a list of references. Be prepared to provide supporting documents, such as: Proof of employment or income, such as recent pay stubs or W2 forms. If you are about to start a new job, you may need a letter from your new employer. Your photo ID. Personal references (e.g., from professors or employers). Information about your co-signer, if you have one. This may be necessary if you have poor credit, no credit history, or don’t meet the minimum income requirement for the apartment."

These fees can range from $15-20 sometimes coming up to $100 or more in the U.S. [5] X Research source If you won’t be moving into your apartment right away, your landlord may also ask you to pay a deposit so they can hold your apartment while you’re getting ready to move in. If you are approved, you may need to pay additional fees, such as a security deposit or pet deposit. Check the laws in your area to make sure the landlord or management company is not charging you illegal fees. For example, in Boston, it is illegal for landlords to charge application fees, credit check fees, finder’s fees, or a fee for holding an apartment. [6] X Research source"

It’s a good idea to do this a few weeks in advance. You may need to be present for some utility hookups, so let the utility companies know when you will be moving in and schedule the hookups at a time when you can be there. Make sure that, at minimum, you will have electricity, water and gas set up at move-in time. Ask your landlord or property manager which companies supply these basic utilities to your apartment building. You will also need to look into setting up Internet, phone lines (if you need a landline), and TV service (if you want it).

In addition to your apartment key, you may also receive keys for the main entrance, storage areas, laundry room, or other common areas. It’s a good idea to have extra copies of at least your main apartment key and the key that lets you into the building. Go to a locksmith, hardware store, or key-cutting kiosk to get an extra set of keys made. Leave the keys with a friend or family member you trust in case of an emergency."

Try an exchange website like Freecycle.org, or go to a local bookstore, grocery store, or liquor store to see if they have boxes to spare. [8] X Research source Try to pack heavier items, like books, in smaller boxes. Otherwise, you might end up with a bunch of boxes that are too heavy to move!

For example, if you are moving a chest of drawers, consider wrapping it in plastic wrap to protect the chest and keep the drawers in place. Some items may need to be partially disassembled for easier transport and move-in (e.g., you might need to take the legs off your couch to get it through the apartment door). Put any loose parts in a bag, and tape it to the furniture. Wrap any fragile items in moving blankets or furniture pads to protect them from bumps and scratches."

Renting a van or truck can be especially helpful if you’re moving long-distance and can’t make multiple trips to bring over all your belongings. Search online for truck rental companies in your area, and read up on their terms and prices. Look for online reviews to determine if the company is reliable and trustworthy.
