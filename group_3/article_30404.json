[2] X Research source But realizing that needles are now much thinner and cause less pain may help relax you before an injection. [3] X Research source Ask your doctor or the person injecting you about the size of the needle if you like or what type of pain you might feel. In some cases, they may even show you how small it is. Recognize that fear of needles or injections is very common. [4] X Research source"

Ask her to explain how she will do the injection before she starts. Ask your doctor to talk to you while she injects you as a distraction technique.

[7] X Research source Focus on an object in the opposite direction of where you are getting the injection. Look at a picture or other object in the room. Watch your feet. This can help you take the focus off of your injection site. [8] X Research source Closing your eyes may help you relax and avoid anticipation of the injection. Imagine something else like a warm beach while your eyes are closed."

      "title": "Use relaxation techniques.",
      "content": "Use relaxation techniques. Relaxing your entire body can help you get through an injection. From breathing exercises to medication, try different relaxation techniques before and during an injection. Squeeze a stress ball or other type of sensory object with the hand opposite your injection arm. [13] X Research source Breathe slowly and deeply. Inhale deeply for four seconds and then exhale for the same amount of time. This type of rhythmic breathing, sometimes called pranayama, can relax you and may also distract you. Double up on your relaxation techniques if necessary. [14] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Tense and release muscle groups starting with your toes and ending at your forehead. Tense muscle groups for about 10 seconds and then give them 10 seconds to release. Take a deep breath in between groups to further relax you. Take an anti-anxiety medication to relax you. The injection is very quick, and likely the anxiety medication will far exceed the medication, so only use this if your fear or nervousness is extreme. Make sure to let the doctor know that you took the medication in case there are any contraindications with the injection and make sure you have someone to drive you home afterwards."

      "title": "Script the injection.",

I know I’m here for an injection and I’m a bit scared. But I’d like to talk about my upcoming vacation to Munich while you give me the injection.” Stick to the script as much as you can during the procedure. Take your notes with you if that helps."

      "content": "Frame the injection in simple terms. Framing and guided imagery are behavioral techniques that can shape how you think and feel about specific situations by making them seem commonplace or banal. Use either technique to help you manage your injection appointment. Reframe the injection as “this is a quick poke and feels like a baby bee sting.” [15] X Trustworthy Source University of Wisconsin Health Integrated healthcare system of the University of Wisconsin focused on treating and providing support to patients and public health initiatives Go to source Guide yourself with different imagery during the injection. For example, picture yourself on the top of a mountain or on a warm beach. Work with manageable units to manage the injection. For example, break it up into greeting the doctor, asking questions, distracting yourself during the procedure, and then happily heading home."
