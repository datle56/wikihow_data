      "content": "Sanguine Art is something to work towards. As it's considered one of the best fighting styles in the game, it's a good choice to get it.

Getting the Leviathan Heart is probably the most time-consuming part of the process, because there are a few prerequisites to getting this item as well: [1] X Research source Obtain the Beast Hunter boat. You can craft it by giving the Beast Hunter NPC 20 Leviathan Scales, 6 Electric Wings, 2 Mutant Teeth, 30 Fools Gold, and 6 Shark Teeth. Once you craft it, the Beast Hunter boat will be available for purchase for $5,000 from the Luxury Boat Dealer. Bring the Beast Hunter boat to go fight Leviathan . If you can't get the Beast Hunter boat, you can also get on an allied player's Beast Hunter boat. Defeat Leviathan. Make sure you don't die during the Leviathan fight, as this will render you ineligible to get the heart. If you die after Leviathan is defeated, you can still get the heart. Use the Harpoon on the Leviathan Heart after defeating it. Note that the Leviathan Heart will despawn if it's not harpooned within 1 minute of defeating Leviathan. Be on the Beast Hunter boat with the harpooned Leviathan Heart when it arrives at the Tiki Outpost. If you died after defeating Leviathan, just make your way back to the Beast Hunter boat and board it before it docks. 20 Demonic Wisps. Demonic Wisps are a possible drop from Demonic Souls, which are found in the Haunted Castle in the Third Sea. [2] X Research source 20 Vampire Fangs. Vampire Fangs are a possible drop from Vampires, which are found in the Graveyard in the Second Sea. [3] X Research source 2 Dark Fragments. Dark Fragments are a guaranteed drop from Darkbeard, a raid boss that can be summoned in the Dark Arena (north of the Kingdom of Rose in the Second Sea). [4] X Research source"
