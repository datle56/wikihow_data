      "content": "A mature hairline is the slightly recessed hairline men develop as they age. A maturing hairline is completely natural and begins to appear in most men between the ages of 17 and 30 (although exactly when it sets in depends on a number of factors, largely genetics). Before this, young men and teens have a juvenile hairline that sits lower on the forehead. As they get older, the hairline recedes evenly and gradually about 1 or 1.5 inches (2.5 or 3.8 cm) higher to form a mature hairline . [1] X Research source A hairline is the outer edge of your hair that separates your forehead from your hair and scalp. How high or low the hairline is depends on your age, genetics, lifestyle habits, and more. Technically, a mature hairline is a receding hairline. However, the recession is more gradual and less noticeable than a fully receding hairline and eventually stops once the hairline has settled into place. Most women also develop mature or slightly receding hairlines as they age, but it’s usually less pronounced and more gradual than in most men."

If your hairline is on or very near that wrinkle, then your hairline is still juvenile. If it has crept up to about 1 or 1.5 inches (2.5 or 3.8 cm) above the wrinkle, your hairline is mature. Any farther than that and you may have a fully receding hairline. [2] X Research source"

However, if the widow’s peak became very pronounced very quickly, it might be a receding hairline. [3] X Research source"

A mature hairline will also eventually settle into place and stop receding, while a true receding hairline will keep progressing. [6] X Research source"

[8] X Research source Both a mature and receding hairline can make an “M” shape as the temples thin out.

      "content": "A man’s hairline gradually matures from about ages 17 to 30. This doesn’t mean you’ll see your hairline rising as soon as you turn 17, though. [16] X Research source Some men will keep their juvenile hairline into their early 20s, while some may not notice any visible recession until closer to 30. The exact timing of when your hairline starts to mature depends largely on your genetics and family history, but nearly all men will see some recession during their 20s. You can tell if your hairline recession is normal by how gradual it is. If it changes very subtly over time, it’s just maturing. If it recedes rapidly, it may be a receding hairline or the early stages of balding. Usually, a man’s hair is thickest during puberty and for a time afterward, possibly into his 30s."

      "content": "No, having a mature hairline does not mean you’ll lose more hair or go bald. For one, a mature hairline is a normal part of aging and the hairline will stop receding once it settles into its “mature” place. Balding, on the other hand, is either genetic (like male pattern baldness) or caused by another underlying condition and will continue progressing as time goes on (there’s no point where it settles into place like a mature hairline). Check your family history if you’re concerned your maturing hairline might be part of bigger hair loss. If your father is bald, you’re twice as likely to have male pattern baldness. If your mother’s father is bald, you’re even more likely to experience balding. [17] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source If you don’t have a family history of hair loss and you see no other signs of thinning or balding besides your hairline moving up slightly, chances are you’ll retain a full head of hair for quite a while. As you get older, though, you may start to experience more pronounced hair loss or thinning (even if it isn’t full on male pattern baldness). About 25% of men show signs of hair loss by age 21, but this goes up to 50% by age 50 and 70% as aging continues.

      "content": "Try different hairstyles that flatter or hide your hairline. If you’re concerned that your maturing hairline is very visible or your current haircut is making it more obvious, try a new style that disguises it a bit. Here are some of the most effective styles for a mature hairline: [19] X Research source Buzz cut : A military-style haircut where all of your hair is buzzed down with the lowest clipper grade (you’ll look nearly shaved). Crew cut: Long hair on top with close-cropped or faded sides. Style with a matte wax for fullness. Ivy League cut: Like a crew cut but with long enough hair on top for a part or other styling. It looks polished and refined with a mature hairline. French crop cut : Faded or cropped hair on the sides with longer fringe or even spikes on top. The fringe hides your hairline fairly well and the style requires little to no maintenance. Pompadour : A high-volume cut on top that’s styled or slicked backward to reveal your temples and trimmed sides. It’s a great option if you want to show off your widow’s peak. Shaggy bangs: A messier style with bangs that hand over the hairline to look more laid-back and casual. It’s great for hiding the hairline and making you look more youthful. Fully shaved: Consider shaving your head to fully hide your hairline (and try out a bold new look)."

Unless your hair loss is due to an underlying condition (in which case, you’d have to treat the condition itself to see results), some medication can help slow down or reverse the effects of natural hair loss from aging or even treat male pattern baldness . The most common options are: [20] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Minoxidil (Rogaine) : This non-prescription drug comes in liquid, foam, or shampoo form and can slow hair loss and stimulate regrowth. Follow the instructions for your specific product; typically, you’ll apply to your scalp twice a day. It may take 6 months or more to see improvement or tell if it’s working for you. Finasteride (Propecia): This prescription drug for men is taken daily as a pill. It may also take several months to see results and may not be as effective for men over 60. Both medications only work as long as you’re taking them. If you stop, then your hair loss will resume."

There are several different procedures you might want to explore if your hairline is really bothering you and medications aren’t working. Keep in mind, though, that surgery may only delay the inevitable if you’re experiencing hereditary hair loss or male pattern baldness. [21] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Common procedures include: Follicular unit extraction (FUE): A minimally-invasive, low-scarring procedure where hair follicles from dense regions are inserted into the balding region to promote hair growth. This is the most popular hair restoration technique. [22] X Research source Follicular unit transplantation (FUT): A more invasive procedure with a longer recovery time than FUE where a strip of skin from the back of the head is taken and turned into grafts which are implanted in the balding region. This procedure is effective, but less popular than FUE. Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) injections: A patient’s blood is placed in a centrifuge to separate out the plasma and platelets from other blood components. The plasma is then injected into the balding region to stimulate hair growth and healing.

      "content": "Make lifestyle changes that put less stress on your hair. A healthy lifestyle won’t necessarily replenish your hairline by itself, but making a few positive changes can support other hair regrowth methods. For starters, be gentler with your hair; don’t tug or pull at your hair when it’s wet and try using a wide-tooth comb to prevent pulling out hair. Steer clear of harsh treatments (like curling irons, hot rollers, or perms) and high-tension styles (like extra tight braids or ponytails). Additionally: [26] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Protect your hair from harsh sunlight and UV rays with hats, shade, or a UV-protective hair spray . Try to cut back or quit smoking . Studies show that smoking is linked to baldness in men. Lower your stress levels in general. Get a good night’s sleep each night, exercise regularly, eat a nutritious diet, and make time for self-care and hobbies. High, chronic stress is associated with more rapid hair loss."

      "content": "Mature hairlines are caused by biological aging and genetic factors. The biggest factor is likely your levels of the hormone dihydrotestosterone (DHT). As you age past puberty, your elevated levels of testosterone break down into elevated levels of DHT. [27] X Research source DHT is active in your scalp region and is thought to be responsible for shrinking your hair follicles, shortening your hair growth cycle, and contributing to other hair loss and thinning as you get older. [28] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source The hairline is the first to experience the effects of DHT. If you have typical levels of DHT or aren't very sensitive to it, your hairline will mature without receding further. However, if you have excess DHT and/or a family history of baldness, your hairline may keep receding past the typical 1.5 inches (3.8 cm) of a mature hairline."
