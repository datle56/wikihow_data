      "content": "In comedy, “punching down” means making fun of people or groups who are less powerful or privileged than you. When a comedian punches down, they’re basically making a marginalized person or group (like African Americans, gay people, people with disabilities, etc.) the butt of their joke or the object of their ridicule. These kinds of jokes are often looked down upon because they reinforce stereotypes, prejudices, or existing power imbalances that contribute to discrimination or exclusion. [1] X Research source Some comedians argue you should “never punch down” and believe these types of jokes are lazy and alienating. Others believe that punching down may be OK sometimes depending on the joke’s wording, context, and subtext. Example: Say a male comedian tells a joke about how all women take a long time to get ready. Men are considered more powerful in society and the joke reinforces a stereotype that women are appearance-obsessed, so this would be considered punching down by most. However, if the joke had been about a specific woman that the comic knows (and not generalizing about an entire gender), it could be considered a roast or an observational joke from the comic’s own life.

      "content": "More broadly, it can be any verbal attack on a less powerful or privileged person. Punching down isn’t just a comedy term. Bullying someone for their race, religion, sexual orientation, gender, disability, or other marginalized part of their identity could be considered pushing down, for example. Or, politicians and news anchors who make false claims about groups of people based on their identity to sway votes or get higher ratings would be punching down, too."

      "title": "“Punching up” is when you make fun of those with more power.",
      "content": "“Punching up” is when you make fun of those with more power. Punching up is the exact opposite of punching down and usually targets politicians, bosses, oppressive groups, or anyone higher in status than the comedian. By targeting these groups with humor, a comedian can challenge the status quo and hold powerful people accountable in front of large audiences. It’s a funny way to call attention to specific issues and advocate for systemic change. [3] X Research source Example: Say a working class comic makes a joke at the expense of corrupt politicians who take bribes. As this group generally holds more power in society, this would be an example of punching up. However, say the comic honed in on a specific corrupt politician who happens to be a different race. If the comic started making race jokes at their expense, they would be linking that person’s race to their corruption. This would contribute to stereotypes and could be considered more of a “punching down” joke. [4] X Research source Outside of comedy, any critique or verbal attack against someone of higher status might also be considered “punching up.” Side note: In comedy, “punching up” also refers to editing a joke to heighten it or make it sharper. For example, “Your set is great, but you could punch up the bit about outer space.”"

      "title": "“Punching sideways” or “in” means mocking yourself or people like you.",
      "content": "“Punching sideways” or “in” means mocking yourself or people like you. These kinds of jokes could be self-deprecating (aimed at yourself) or meant to be enjoyed or appreciated by members of a specific community the comedian belongs to, like an inside joke. These jokes can help communities bond (and help comedians build a personal brand), but they come with risks. Listeners that are not in the community may find them enjoyable for stereotypical reasons. Some argue that these jokes may also contribute to a “ranking” of marginalized groups without attacking the power structure that holds them down. [5] X Research source Example: Say a trans comic makes a joke about “choosing” to be trans. This could be considered an inside joke with the LGBTQ+ community (and their allies) since no one “chooses” their gender identity or sexual orientation. However, it’s possible people with prejudices against trans people could hear this and feel their beliefs have been validated."

      "title": "“Punching” up or down probably comes from boxing terminology.",
      "content": "“Punching” up or down probably comes from boxing terminology. In the mid-1900s, sports writers used the terms “punching up” or “punching down” to refer to boxers who were throwing literal punches at an opponent who was above or below their weight class. In 2002, the term became more metaphorical when a report about a soccer coach hitting a player in London came out. The incident was still sports-related, but also brought power dynamics into play (coach vs. player). [6] X Research source Later, in 2006, sportscaster-turned-pundit Keith Olbermann said “You don’t punch down. If you’re in my position, you punch upwards,” to contrast himself with Fox News host Bill O’Reilly. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "George Carlin popularized the idea in a 1990 Larry King interview . The legendary comedian didn’t say “punching down” or “punching up” exactly, but many listeners interpret his words as supporting the idea that punching down is problematic: “Comedy traditionally has picked on people in power, people who abuse their power. Women and gays and immigrants are, to my way of thinking, underdogs.” [8] X Research source However, Carlin also expresses that comics should be able to perform how they want and that he will “defend to the death his right to do everything he does” when referring to another comic in the same interview. [9] X Research source Today, some argue it’s inaccurate to say Carlin was a strong advocate against punching down as a hard rule and point to some of his jokes as examples of punching in all directions."

      "content": "Not necessarily—some say there are times when it’s OK to punch down. Depending on the comic and the context, punching down might actually be a way to uplift marginalized communities by showing you’re “in on the joke” or covertly punching upward. Take this joke from pro comedian Nikki Glaser directed at Caitlyn Jenner as an example: [10] X Research source “I know you’ve only publicly identified as a woman for a few years, but I just want you to know that I know that deep down, you’ve always been a c***.” On the surface, this seems like a punching-down trans joke and a rude insult directed at a trans woman. However, Glaser is a known roast comedian who has vocalized support for LGBTQ+ people before, and Jenner is a wealthy, white celebrity who has at times caused harm to her own trans community and others. [11] X Research source In this context, Glaser is actually swiping at a problematic celebrity and acknowledging that the trans community sometimes has issues with Jenner as well (she’s “in on the joke”). Some comics say it can be self-aggrandizing to think that nobody “less powerful” than you can take a joke, and that by being too cautious, you can actually exclude people from the fun. However, most also recommend using these kinds of jokes sparingly. It’s also worth mentioning that punching up does not always guarantee a laugh or applause."

      "content": "There’s no standard definition of what “power” is and who has it. Some people, like bosses or politicians, are clearly in positions of power and therefore have a target on their backs for jokes. But when you start weighing different identities and privileges outside of those defined hierarchies, it gets a lot more complicated to determine who has higher or lower status. Blanket rules don’t always sit well with performers because their unique identity, experiences, and point of view all shape the jokes they want to tell."

      "content": "You may risk your jokes conforming to ideology over personal experience. Some argue that by being afraid to punch down out of fear of being canceled or critiqued, comics just end up repeating similar premises and punchlines about equality and power dynamics (similar to the wider argument about how “political correctness has gone too far”). Comedians become more concerned with how their beliefs will be perceived versus how funny their joke is. [12] X Research source The larger argument is that political correctness or always trying to punch up can limit a comedian’s creativity and that the point of comedy is to push boundaries."

      "title": "Some who say “never punch down” are not comedians themselves.",
      "content": "Some who say “never punch down” are not comedians themselves. Some professional comics say that “punching up” or “punching down” were not created by humorists or comedians and shouldn’t apply to jokes in such a black-and-white way. Others argue that “never punch down” is popular among non-comedians who operate from a moral high ground and think they have all the “correct” opinions about what’s offensive and what’s not. [13] X Research source Obviously, everyone is free to listen to whichever jokes they like. However, some feel that letting the audience dictate what the jokes should be about is against the point."

      "content": "Write from your own experience with empathy for different points of view. First and foremost, write what you know. An authentic perspective is refreshing and engaging for audiences, while trying to write humor about or from the point of view of other groups can come off insincere, crass, or at worst, an offensive punch-down joke (for example, writing about the Black experience as a white person). After writing, put yourself in another person’s shoes and look over your material. What’s the impact of your joke? Would you like it if it were applied to you or part of your identity? It’s possible to be edgy and push boundaries while still being socially responsible, and the best comics manage to walk this line successfully. [14] X Research source It may also go without saying, but don’t use “free speech” as a disguise to say blatantly racist, sexist, ableist, homophobic, xenophobic, or other -ist and -phobic statements. These kinds of jokes are definitely punching down and usually come off as angry or bigoted instead of funny."
