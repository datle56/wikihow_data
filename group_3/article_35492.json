You may have posted the video as an Instagram reel or sent it through a messaging app like Discord. If you posted your video to a social media account you can't access anymore, you can save the video by using a video downloader .

      "content": "Get your video from an iCloud or iTunes backup. If you regularly make backups of your phone's data, an old backup may have the video saved on it. You can use either an iCloud or iTunes backup, but only attempt this method if you're certain the video is saved in an old backup, as this method can lead to data loss. Before you attempt to restore an old backup, make a new backup of your phone that you can go back to if you have data on your phone you don't want to lose. After you recover the old video, upload it to Google Drive or send it to your email before you go back to your most current backup."

      "content": "Contact a local data recovery service for a quote. Data recovery services have the tools and knowledge on how to get into a hard drive and recover deleted memory. However, because this process is difficult, recovering data may cost you a few hundred to a few thousand dollars. [3] X Research source This may not be a feasible method if you're looking to recover one or two lost videos, but if you lost an important video or a big chunk of your data, it may be worth looking into. Not every data recovery service will service iPhones. Search \"data recovery service near me\" in a search engine to find local companies that can help you get your data back."
