[2] X Research source Each player draws 1 domino from the pile and flips it face-up. [3] X Research source Count the pips (dots) on each domino. Whoever drew the domino with the most pips starts the game as the dealer. [4] X Research source You can choose the first dealer randomly if you want to save a little time. You can play 42 with a double-nine or double-twelve set as long as you remove any dominoes showing a 7 or higher."

      "title": "Check your hand for doubles and dominoes that share a suit.",
      "content": "Check your hand for doubles and dominoes that share a suit. The domino suits are the values on one side of a domino, so each domino has 2 suits. Double dominoes have the same suit on each side, like 6-6 and 5-5. Doubles are valuable, so having 3 or 4 of them means you have a good hand. If you have 3–4 dominoes with the same suit, that's also a good hand. This means you have a majority of dominoes in that suit, giving you control of it. [7] X Research source The domino suits rank from high to low going sixes, fives, fours, threes, twos, ones, and blanks (when the side of a domino has 0 pips). [8] X Research source Even if multiple dominoes share a lower suit, it’s a strong hand since you have the majority of dominoes. A trick is when each player plays one domino from their hand to the middle of the table. Each trick is made up of 4 dominoes, 1 from each player. Players have 7 dominoes in their hand, so each round has 7 tricks. Each trick is worth 1 point."

      "content": "Look for point dominoes in your hand. The 5 dominoes with a total of 5 or 10 pips earn extra points at the end of the round and are called point dominoes . When a player wins the trick they’re played into, the dominoes are worth 5 or 10 points depending on how many pips they have. The total you can earn for collecting all the point dominoes is 35 points. The point dominoes worth 5 points are 5-0, 4-1, and 2-3. The point dominoes worth 10 points are 5-5 and 6-4."

[9] X Research source The player places a bid on how many points they think their team can collectively earn from winning tricks and collecting point dominoes. If another player already made a bid, the next person must make a higher bid than them. [10] X Research source Players only get 1 bid per round. The maximum bid a player can make is 42. Players aren’t allowed to communicate what they have in their hands with their teammate. Keep bids conservative since a team won’t earn any points if they don’t meet their bid."

If a player has a lot of low-valued dominoes in their hand or dominoes of different suits, they can say “pass” instead of bidding. Players can also pass if they don’t want to raise the bid any higher since it could make it tougher to compete for points. [11] X Research source If everyone passes without making a bid, reshuffle the dominoes and deal them again. [12] X Research source Or, as an alternate variation, the dealer must bid 30 points if everyone passes. If a teammate passes, it’s a signal they have a bad hand and that you should only bid if you have points showing in your hand."

The highest bidder checks their hand for the suit they have the most of and says it out loud to the rest of the table so they know what the trump suit is for the hand. [13] X Research source The trump suit acts as the highest suit for the current hand and will beat any other suits played during a trick. The player can claim doubles as a suit when choosing trump. 6-6 becomes the highest-valued domino for the round."

If multiple players played the trump suit, the domino with the most pips is the winner. If no one played a trump, the double of the lead suit wins. Otherwise, count the pips on the dominoes with the lead suit to determine who won the trick. The winner takes all of the dominoes played to the trick and sets them face-up near them. [17] X Research source Example: Fives are the trump suit and sixes are the led suit. If the played dominoes are 5-3, 6-1, 6-2, and 5-2, then the player who put down 5-3 will win the trick. Example: Ones are the trump suit and fours are the led suit. If the dominoes are 4-2, 4-3, 4-4, and 4-6, then 4-4 is the winner of the trick since doubles are the highest value of a suit."
