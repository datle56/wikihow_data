      "content": "Let your dachshund out every 2 hours during the day. Even though you won’t know exactly when your dachshund needs to go potty, it will have predictable times where it has to go out. Immediately after your doxie wakes up, finishes a meal, or has a play session, lead it outside so it has a chance to relieve itself. You should also try taking it outside right before you go to bed for the evening. Even though it may seem tedious, you should aim to let your dog out at least once every 2 hours.

So if you have a 4-month old dachshund, you should be okay leaving it inside for up to 4 hours. [3] X Expert Source David Levin Professional Dog Walker & Trainer Expert Interview. 19 December 2019."

Even though you’re letting your dachshund out every few hours, you may notice some other signals that mean you should let it outside sooner. If your dog circles around on the floor, has stiff back legs, or starts whining, let it out to go potty as soon as you can so you don’t need to clean up an accident.

It doesn’t matter if the spot is in your yard or along the path of your regular walk, but be sure you can go there every time your dog needs to go outside. If you can, choose a place that’s quiet and doesn’t have a lot of distractions so your doxie stays focused on training. Keep your dog on a leash so it doesn’t wander away from your designated spot. [5] X Trustworthy Source The Humane Society of the United States National organization devoted to the promotion of animal welfare Go to source While it may not seem like the most important thing, always take your dog to the same place. Dachshunds learn best from consistency and you may confuse them if you lead them to a different potty spot.

[19] X Research source Avoid getting a crate that’s any larger than you need since your doxie may have enough room to lie down on one end and go potty on the other.
