      "title": "Drop nail polish thinner into the bottle.",
      "content": "Drop nail polish thinner into the bottle. Nail polish thinner is specifically designed to thin and revive dried up polish. Add one drop of the thinner to the nail polish bottle at a time. Then, tightly close the bottle and roll it between your hands for a few seconds. Open the bottle again and repeat the process until the polish is the desired consistency. [1] X Research source Read the instructions for the nail polish thinner carefully, as different brands may have more specific instructions."

      "content": "Rinse the polish brush with acetone and place it back in the bottle. Pour some acetone in a glass bowl. Then, swirl the nail polish brush in the acetone until it’s clean, making sure to get rid of any clumps of polish. Place the brush back in the bottle once it’s clean and soaked with acetone. Shake the bottle lightly to help thin and loosen the rest of the polish. [2] X Research source If some clumps of polish won’t come off the brush, use a paper towel to remove them. Acetone is acidic, so avoid placing it in a plastic container. Consider mixing the acetone with orange oil before cleaning the brush, as this can help prevent dryness later on. [3] X Research source This is a temporary fix as acetone can break down polish over time and prevent it from drying on your nails. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Add nail polish remover to the polish bottle.",
      "content": "Add nail polish remover to the polish bottle. Nail polish remover contains acetone and can help thin out stubborn polish. Simply add one drop of nail polish remover to the polish bottle at a time, close the polish back up, roll the bottle between your hands, and then check the consistency. The more nail polish remover you add, the thinner the polish will be, so be careful! Try using an eyedropper to add the nail polish remover in with more precision. This is a temporary fix and some people caution against it. Acetone can break down polish over time, dissolving the lacquer and preventing it from drying properly. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Put the nail polish bottle in hot water for 2 minutes.",
      "content": "Put the nail polish bottle in hot water for 2 minutes. If the polish isn’t completely dried out, there may be hope with this quick fix! Heat up a cup of water. Then, place the nail polish bottle in the water. Wait 2 minutes, and then remove the polish and shake to help loosen the polish. [6] X Research source Make sure the bottle is tightly closed to prevent water from getting in the polish. The hot water can help soften and thin thicker polish, making it easier to apply; however, know that this isn’t a permanent or foolproof trick."

      "title": "Roll the bottle between your hands.",
      "content": "Roll the bottle between your hands. For only slightly thickened nail polish, you may be able to get it flowing again by just rolling it between your hands. Turn the bottle upside down once, allowing color to redistribute. Then, place the bottle between your palms and roll it back and forth. While this method isn’t foolproof, the heat from your hands may be enough to thin polish that’s only slightly thickened."

      "content": "Store nail polish in a cool, dry place. The best way to ensure your polishes stay fresh? Keep them in a cool and dry place. An environment that’s too hot or cold can affect the consistency of nail polish, making it too thick or drying it out. [7] X Research source Opt for a cabinet, container, or drawer that’s not in a moist bathroom or closet."

      "content": "Clean the top of the bottle with nail polish remover or acetone. Caked-on-dried polish can prevent the nail polish bottle from closing properly. This can allow air to seep into the bottle and cause dry, thick polish. To prevent this, simply clean the screwtop of the bottle with a little bit of nail polish remover or acetone and a cotton pad.

      "content": "Throw out nail polish after a couple of years. If the nail polish you’re trying to loosen up is over 2 years old, it may be too old to fix. Believe it or not, nail polishes have an expiration date, and once opened and if not stored properly, can expire. Save yourself some time and throw out old polishes. [9] X Research source Expired nail polish can be dried out, gooey, thick, and separated."

      "content": "Do not keep nail polish in the refrigerator. Back in the day, it was popular to store nail polish in the fridge as it was believed to slow down discoloration. However, storing nail polish in the refrigerator alters the chemical composition of the nail polish, causing it to dry out faster. Instead, opt for a cool, dry cupboard or container."
