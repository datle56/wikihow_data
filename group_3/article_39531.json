      "content": "Work your glutes. Strength-training exercises are ultimately the best way to shrink your butt. Muscle takes up less physical space than fat so toning your butt (turning the fat into muscle) will lift it and make it smaller. Carrying more muscle will also increase your metabolism and bring your whole body into proportion. [1] X Research source Doing dead lifts is a great exercise for your glutes. When doing a deadlift, emphasize form over weight. Keep your spine in a neutral position and aligned with your head and shoulders, engage your core throughout the deadlift, and rest your weight on your heels. [2] X Expert Source Melody Sayers, MS, RD, NASM-CPT Registered Dietician & Personal Trainer Expert Interview. 6 May 2020. Add squats into your routine. With your legs hip-width apart, slowly bend your knees, engaging your glutes as you go. Bend down as far as you can with your back straight, then stand back up to complete 1 squat. Doing lunges is another fantastic exercise for your butt. [3] X Expert Source Melody Sayers, MS, RD, NASM-CPT Registered Dietician & Personal Trainer Expert Interview. 6 May 2020. With one leg in front and one leg behind you, slowly bend your front knee until it’s at a 90-degree angle to the floor. Then, stand back up to complete 1 lunge. Do wall sits to fire up your glutes. With your back against a wall, bend your legs at a 90-degree angle to the floor, like you’re sitting in a chair. Hold the position for as long as you can, then stand up. Climb stairs to work your glutes. Simply walking up a set of stairs is a great way to target the muscles in your bum. As often as you can, take the stairs instead of an elevator to slim down."

Running, swimming, boxing, or cycling will burn the most calories. [4] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Burning calories leads to weight loss, which equals a smaller butt.

      "title": "Begin circuit training",
      "content": "Begin circuit training to mix up your exercise routine. Pick a high-intensity exercise, like squats, lunges, or climbing stairs. Then, alternate between this glute-toning exercise and a different high-intensity cardio activity every 30 minutes. [7] X Research source Circuit training is about combinations of using weights and doing cardio. If you don't have access to a number of weights or machines, jog with weights in intervals of a minute or two. Otherwise, add weights to your cardio exercises. You'll be killing 2 birds with one dumbbell."

      "content": "Eat the right carbs and fats. So often carbs and fats are made into villains.

Avocados, olives, nuts, olive oil, and salmon all have good unsaturated fats that will keep you satiated, which will keep you from overeating later. Whole-grain and whole-wheat breads, cereals and pasta, oatmeal, couscous, quinoa, and brown rice are good carbs that provide fiber, energy, and keep your insulin levels normal."
