      "content": "1961 Political Dispensers: $20,000 – $25,000 In 1961, PEZ Candy Company created and presented three political dispensers as a gift to President John F. Kennedy. Two of the dispensers feature a donkey head, while the third features an elephant head—these animals are meant to honor America’s two-party system. One of the donkey dispensers was presented to JFK during his visit to Austria just before his assassination. [1] X Research source What are they worth? These PEZ dispensers are rare enough to be placed in museums rather than be up for auction. One of the donkeys, for instance, can be seen at the PEZ Visitor Center in Orange, Connecticut. However, their combined value is estimated to be between $20,000 – $25,000 ."

      "content": "1982 World's Fair Astronauts: $12,000, Unknown This rare pair of PEZ dispensers are shrouded in mystery—and that mystery extends to their estimated value. Allegedly, only two of these dispensers were ever created, and they were produced for the 1982 World’s Fair in Knoxville, Tennessee for two PEZ employees. One is blue with a yellow helmet, and the other is white with a yellow helmet. However, only the former of these two dispensers has ever been found. [2] X Research source What is it worth? The blue dispenser (known as “Astronaut B”) has been valued at $12,000 by the PEZ Price Guide. The white dispenser has been lost to time—if it were ever to resurface, it would likely have an even higher value than Astronaut B. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Mickey Mouse Soft Head: $3,500 Most people are familiar with the modern PEZ dispensers, which have a hard plastic head. However, some 1970s-era dispensers had soft rubber heads that portrayed popular Disney characters. Disney rejected the project after the soft-head prototypes were made, meaning that these dispensers never made it to market. [4] X Research source What is it worth? Since so few of these gummy-headed PEZ dispensers exist, they’re quite valuable—the Mickey Mouse edition sold in 2019 for $3,500 ."

The head of this dispenser features the beloved elephant with his big blue ears and a yellow hat. The rubber-like head is attached to a peak dispenser stem. [5] X Research source What is it worth? One of the Dumbo PEZ prototypes sold for $2,728 in 2019."

One of these villains was Peter Pan’s Captain Hook, whose oversized head sits atop a dark red PEZ stem. [6] X Research source What is it worth? A Captain Hook Soft Head sold in 2019 for $2,247 in an eBay auction."

Since only one pair of these PEZ dispensers exists, they’re one of the rarest types you can find! [7] X Research source What are they worth?

The footless dispensers feature an astronaut head that’s wearing a white or silver helmet atop a pink stem. [9] X Research source However, it’s really rare to catch a glimpse of these rare dispensers as collectors usually hold on to them. [10] X Research source What is it worth?

There are two versions of this dispenser: both have a blue stem topped with a Mary Poppins head under a pink cap. [11] X Research source However, one version has painted red cheeks, and one does not.

Released in 1990, the Merry Music Maker series features a whistle on the back of its head that kids could blow through in order to create ~merry music~ as they ate their PEZ candies.

[17] X Research source The mustachioed dispenser is most valuable, although there is a facial-hair-free version that’s also worth quite a bit of money, coming in at an estimated $675. These dispensers were given away at the 1972 Munich Olympics—so their historic significance increases their value. [18] X Research source What is it worth?

      "content": "Consider whether your dispenser is still in its box. Like most rare collectibles, items that haven’t been unboxed are generally more valuable. Boxed dispensers are more likely to be in mint or near-mint condition, which also increases their value. If your PEZ has been taken out of its box, however, that doesn’t mean that it has no significant value—it may just be slightly diminished. [31] X Research source"

      "content": "Check the patent number to tell if it’s vintage (rather than modern). PEZ dispensers have a patent number running down the side of their stem—this number will tell you the dispenser’s age. Since older dispensers are generally more valuable than modern ones, an older patent number or a patent number from a significant era may raise your PEZ’s price. [32] X Research source For instance, dispensers with patent numbers 2,620,061 or 3,410,455 may be more valuable than others. These toys were made from 1952–1974, a peak era for PEZ."

      "title": "Verify if your PEZ dispenser is feetless (rather than footed).",
      "content": "Verify if your PEZ dispenser is feetless (rather than footed). Modern PEZ dispensers have “feet,” or a black plastic block at the bottom of their stem that’s used to help them stand upright. The standardization of these “feet” started around the 1980s. So, a footless dispenser may be a sign of an older model, which is likely to make it more valuable. [33] X Research source"

      "title": "Consider whether your dispenser portrays a popular character.",
      "content": "Consider whether your dispenser portrays a popular character. This aspect of PEZ valuation is pretty simple—is the character head at the top of the stem a recognizable image? If it’s not, it’s unlikely that your PEZ is worth a lot. Collectors of PEZ dispensers and general memorabilia are more likely to spend big bucks on a character that they feel nostalgia towards. [34] X Research source However, this isn’t always true! Some of the most expensive PEZ dispensers—like the Alpine Man or Astronaut A & B—are valuable for their history, not because they feature popular characters."

      "title": "Check the patent number on the side of the stem and compare it to the list below.",
      "content": "Check the patent number on the side of the stem and compare it to the list below. Look for the patent number under the words “Made in (manufacturing country) ,” which is usually on the side of the stem, although it can sometimes be on the bottom of the dispenser. The patent number gives a rough idea of how old the dispenser is—however, it’s possible that the vintage stem has been disassembled and recombined with other, more modern stems. Once you’ve found your patent number, compare it against these numbers to find the estimated year: [35] X Research source 2,620,061: Issued in 1952. 3,410,455: Issued in 1968. 3,845,882: Issued in 1974. 3,942,683: Issued in 1976. 4,966,305: Issued in 1990. 5,984,285: Issued in 1999. 7,523,841: Issued in 2009. 11,459,164: Issued in 2022. Note: PEZ collectors typically refer to a patent number using only the first two digits. For instance, patent number 3,845,882 is referred to as a 3.8 patent."

Kennedy—with the animals meant to represent the Democratic and Republican parties, respectively.
