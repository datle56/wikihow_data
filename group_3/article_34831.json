Note, however, that many people do not believe in magic or the efficacy of curses, and there is little scientific evidence to suggest they work. Studies have shown that people who believe they're cursed and feel helpless against it may suffer from diastolic flaccidity, which causes a rapid drop in blood pressure and can lead to death.

It is a popular belief amongst witches that curses are unethical and, as a result, will return to the curser in the same form they have been given. [3] X Research source If you curse someone, be prepared for bad luck to visit you as well. A common Wiccan concept also abides by this reap-what-you-sow mentality: it says that whatever you do, whether it be positive or negative , will come back to you threefold. There is little known about the psychological impact the person placing the curse may suffer when they are successful in hurting their target. If you place a curse on someone, you might suffer psychological stresses that you can't even imagine at this point. [4] X Research source"

Chances are, your time and energy are better spent moving your life forward instead of dwelling on negative emotions that will only make you feel worse. When you take time out of your life to seek vengeance instead of moving on , you're wasting valuable moments in which you could be bettering your life. The person who hurt you might very well deserve to have something bad happen to them, but they certainly don't deserve to take up any more of your time. Studies have shown that getting revenge can actually make us feel worse. Experts believe this might be because taking vengeance can make the event seem bigger than it actually was, whereas the failure to take vengeance can make the event seem more trivial in the long run.

In fact, it can be anything that symbolizes your target, including a photograph, some of his/her hair, or even a piece of paper with his/her name on it. If you collect hair or nail clippings from your target, be sure that you do this without being noticed — preferably by taking them from a trash receptacle — otherwise, you could risk getting into trouble not only with your target but the authorities. If you use a photograph of your target, write their name on it legibly in red or black ink. Also use red or black ink for writing your target's name on a piece of paper. If you choose to write your target's name down and include it in the jar, use the name that they identify with as opposed to their full name. For example, if you target's full name is Jonathan Smith, but he goes by John Smith, use “John Smith”. You can even use someone's online username if that's how you know them."

      "content": "Collect objects to use as mediums . The word has many definitions, but in this case, “medium” refers to the substance through which you'll transmit your bad energy (i.e. your curse). Any of the following items will serve as strong mediums: Rusty nails, thumb tacks, or other sharp items can be added to the jar to generally hurt your target. Red pepper flakes or whole red pepper pods will cause your target to become angry. Vinegar may be used to sour the life of an individual, or to sour the relationship between two people. Rose thorns may be used to cause your target harm through deception (as a beautiful rose looks deceptively soft until it pricks your finger) or to sour love. [7] X Research source A match can be added to jars containing paper to fire up your curse whenever you shake or move the jar. Poisonous plants may be added to the jar to cause harm to your target. Just be sure to wear protective gear (e.g. gloves, goggles, face mask) whenever you're handling anything poisonous. Urine (your own) may be added to the jar to help you gain domination over your target. Avoid using urine and blood that are not your own, as these are biohazards and could cause you to become ill. Graveyard soil can be used to drive someone away or drive two people apart. Soil from a fresh grave is the most potent, but taking it may be considered defilement by authorities. If you do decide to remove soil from a new grave, ask permission from the departed's soul and leave an offering — alcohol (e.g., wine poured into the ground), food (e.g., part of your last meal), or money (even a dollar) are standard. Note that you needn't use all of these items in your jar. One or two of them is fine!"

If you do this, make sure that no one sees you and that it's deep enough that no one can find it. Hide your jar well but make sure that it will be easy for you to retrieve if you need to. You never know, you might change your mind and want to break the curse at some point. Another reason to hide the jar well is that if someone finds it and breaks it, the evil intentions of your curse might come back to you. [8] X Research source"

It's also possible that your curse affected someone close to your target instead of your target him/herself. Before deciding that your curse didn't work, consider whether this may be the case.

Again it must be said, however, that your energy is better spent focusing on improving your own situation, rather than on making someone else's life harder.

From there, as your target's anxiety grows, the curse will become stronger. Your target will fulfill your curse for you, and all you did was put the thought into their head. [13] X Research source"

You can literally just give them advice and ask what they're doing all the time, and this will be enough to ruin their focus and make them perform more poorly at whatever they're doing.
