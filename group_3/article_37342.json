      "content": "Listen to each other's points of view. Rather than think of the argument as a you vs the other person, take a collaborative approach and listen mindfully and respectfully to both points of view. [1] X Research source Being collaborative means working side by side to reach a resolution, rather than pit your points of view against each other. Seeking a deeper understanding of the other person's point of view will allow you both to move forward towards a resolution."

      "content": "Identify the issue. Typically, arguments occur when one person's wants or needs are not being met. [2] X Research source So, work together to identify the core issue or problem by expressing how you feel. When you communicate the issue, be conscious of the language you use. For example, focus on using transitions in your sentence with a phrase like “at the same time”, instead of “but”. As well, try to express how you feel, as opposed to what you think the other person feels or thinks. [3] X Research source The issue could be identified in a simple statement like: “When you use your smartphone at dinner, it bothers me,” or “It makes me uncomfortable when you talk about my mother like that.” [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Take responsibility for your actions. Validating the other person's point of view by acknowledge the error of your actions or words is an important step towards forgiveness and resolution. This could be as simple as an apology and an acknowledgement that you made a mistake or are cultivating a bad habit like using your smartphone at the dinner table. Of course, this is a two way conversation, so the other person should also be willing to take responsibility for their actions and words, and apologize for responding angrily. Reader Poll: We asked 938 wikiHow readers about the most effective ways to resolve an argument, and 81% agreed that apologizing and taking accountability for your actions are key. [Take Poll]"

Now that you have identified the root cause of the argument, and have both taken responsibility for your actions or words, have a discussion about possible solutions to the issue. [5] X Expert Source Liana Georgoulis, PsyD Licensed Psychologist Expert Interview. 6 September 2018. Ask each other questions like: “What must change or happen to meet your needs?” “What can we both do to not argue about this issue again?” For example, if you struggle with your friend's smartphone at the table during dinner, suggest limiting their smartphone use to before or after dinner. Or if you take offense to the way your partner talks about your mother, discuss the issues your partner has with your mother and how you can both work to minimize these issues together."

Finding a “win-win” solution does not necessarily mean compromising, as sometimes a compromise can act as a quick-fix solution that doesn't last long. [6] X Expert Source Liana Georgoulis, PsyD Licensed Psychologist Expert Interview. 6 September 2018. A “win-win” solution is when the needs on both sides of the argument are met. [7] X Research source So if you struggle with your friend's smartphone use, agree to times before and after dinner where they are free to use their phones. Or if you have an issue with the way your partner talks about your mother, be open to discussing why your partner talks about your mother in a certain way, and consider a solution where your partner spends less time around your mother."

      "content": "Shake on it, or make up. Showing that you forgive the other person through a physical action like shaking hands, hugging, or even make up sex will reinforce your willingness to move past the argument. It will also be a good reminder for any future disagreements, as you have both acknowledged your mutual respect and love for each other. [8] X Research source Now that you've had a healthy discussion about your relationship, it's important to reward yourselves by enjoying each other's company, so go out for dinner, watch a movie together, or have another drink. [9] X Research source In fact, science has shown that the old adage, “don't go to bed angry” proves true, so don't settle for holding a grudge or withholding your forgiveness, and instead go to bed or leave the discussion with a strong sense of reconciliation and resolution."

[14] X Expert Source Liana Georgoulis, PsyD Licensed Psychologist Expert Interview. 6 September 2018. Depending on how intense the argument is and how good you are at tempering your emotions in the moment, you may feel comfortable with resuming the discussion with the other person once you take a moment to try to calm down. Another approach may be to physically step away from the argument. Let the other person know you need a timeout or time away from the argument. Once you inform them you need to take a break, go into another room, excuse yourself from the table, or head out for a long walk or run. [15] X Research source An argument is a time of heightened emotions, so physically distancing yourself from the situation can help to put your emotions into perspective. But it's essential you let the other person know you need a time away to sort out your thoughts and emotions, and never simply storm off or walk out of the room with no explanation or promise to return to resolve the argument.

      "content": "Work on ending the argument earlier, rather than later. If your anger can be charted on a scale, try to pause and calm down when your anger level is at a three or four, rather than a high 10. By the time you reach level four or higher on the anger scale, you may be so filled with rage or self indignation towards the other person you may end up saying more damaging and hurtful things to the other person. This will then likely make it more difficult to work on a mindful resolution of the argument later. [17] X Research source If an argument does reach a high 10 on the anger scale, and things are said that you or the other person will likely regret saying later, it's important to think about how this conflict will affect your relationship with this person. For partners who don't fight often, forgiveness may be the best way to resolve the argument, especially if it has escalated to a very angry or hurtful level. [18] X Research source Keep in mind that the idea of “fighting fair” is mostly an oxymoron in a relationship, like “jumbo shrimp” or “military intelligence”. [19] X Research source A fight usually begins on uneven or unfair ground for both parties, so even if it does escalate to very angry levels, it's important to work towards forgiveness rather than holding a grudge or being passive aggressive about your anger."

[20] X Research source You can write down your feelings in a journal or diary. You can also try to listen to music to calm down and focus on processing your emotions.

[22] X Expert Source Liana Georgoulis, PsyD Licensed Psychologist Expert Interview. 6 September 2018. The “need to be right” defense usually occurs because we are in fact afraid of being wrong or feel threatened by the other person's point of view. Think about how the other person may be feeling as a result of the argument. Consider if anything you said or did towards them could have acted as a trigger for their anger. Place yourself on the receiving end of your anger and think about how angry or upset you would be if you were in their position. [23] X Research source"
