Originally a quote from The Hunger Games , “May the odds be ever in your favor” has become an everyday phrase for many fans of the franchise.

      "content": "The phrase is a quote from The Hunger Games . The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins is a young adult dystopian novel in which characters fight to the death for the wealthy’s entertainment. The 3 novels were made into 4 movies, with the final book split into 2 films. In the series, when someone says “May the odds be ever in your favor,” it means they hope the character beats the odds and wins the games. [1] X Research source The phrase began gaining popularity with the release of The Hunger Games movie in 2012, in which Elizabeth Banks’s character Effie Trinket says it after selecting District 12’s tributes. In the series, the phrase has a darker undertone of forced optimism and irony. The main character Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence) says the phrase sarcastically to mock the Capitol, as she knows the odds are never in her favor due to the dystopian world she lives in. This phrase can be traced back to similar phrases like “May the odds be with you” and “May the odds favor you,” which are older gambling lingo."

      "content": "Look at individual words to fully understand the phrase’s meaning. While “May the odds be ever in your favor” is grammatically correct in English, most modern sentences aren’t phrased that way, so it may be a bit confusing to non-native speakers. If you’re struggling with this phrase, take a look at the breakdown below to help it make more sense: [5] X Research source May: “May” is a modal verb that is used to express a wish or desire. In this case, “may” is followed by the thing you’re wishing for, which is in turn followed by the base form of an infinitive verb. The odds: “The odds” are the chances of something happening, so in this case, it refers to the chances of winning the Hunger Games. Here, “the odds” are the thing we’re wishing for, so this phrase follows the word “may.” Be: “Be” is the base form of the infinitive phrase “to be,” which follows the thing you’re wishing for. In this case, it follows the phrase “the odds.” Ever: “Ever” is an adverb that means “always.” An adverb modifies a verb and expresses a time, manner, or frequency. In this case, it modifies the word “be” and means that you always want someone to have luck. In your favor: “In your favor” means for something to be to your advantage. When the odds are in your favor, it means you have a high chance of winning."
