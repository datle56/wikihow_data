      "content": "Scrape away all loose or peeling paint attached to the exterior wood. If your home has been painted before, remove all previous paintwork using a manual paint scraper. Paint scrapers are great for working in corners and tight spaces and sharp scrapers do the best job. You may find layers and layers of old paint if your house has been painted several times over the years, which all has to be removed for new paint to adhere to the wood surface underneath. Use a stout unhandled scraper with a curved blade, a drop cloth to catch the old paint, and safety goggles. A smaller scraper can also be used to get into nooks and crannies.These are all available from your local hardware store. [2] X Research source Divide the area to be scraped into parts. Scraping a whole house is a time-consuming job, so it’s good to achieve small victories in the process. A pocket radio can also help overcome the monotony of scraping. A Sony Walkman radio from Kmart costs about $15, so don’t destroy your iPod or smartphone in the process. [3] X Research source Always scrape with the grain of the wood and use a solid pressure, but don’t overdo it or gouge the surface. The idea is to return the wood to its original flatness in preparation for painting. [4] X Research source To finish, scrape lightly against the grain to remove any remaining edges, if necessary. Use the smaller scraper to get into those harder to reach cracks and corners. [5] X Research source Keep your work area well-ventilated, keep plants and animals away, and clean up the paint debris with a vacuum cleaner as you go. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Inspect the wooden surface of your house for rotted wood.",
      "content": "Inspect the wooden surface of your house for rotted wood. Rot is caused when water comes in contact with an unprotected wood surface. It can be hard to find and if left unchecked can completely destroy wooden building materials and even the structural integrity of your home. It’s important to check thoroughly for different types of rot, including dry rot (dry, crumbly sections of wood) and wet rot (soft, soggy spots). Always keep an eye on places where moisture can collect such as window sills, outside doors and sinks. The main principle to remember when checking for rot is that the wood should not be soft when you press on it. [7] X Research source To check for rot, keep a lookout for wear and discolouration. Use binoculars and a flashlight to inspect areas you cannot see up close. [8] X Research source To test for rot, poke wooden boards with a screwdriver to check the integrity of the wood. If the screwdriver is able to penetrate the wood easily, the rot is hazardous and needs to be removed. [9] X Research source Rot inspection should be repeated any time you want to repaint your house, especially in damp climates. [10] X Research source"

      "content": "Remove all traces of rot in the exterior wooden boards. Some types of rot can be repaired, but to be on the safe side, you should remove as much rot as possible before painting weathered wood, and take a few simple steps to prevent the conditions that could cause it to come back. Using a sharp tool such as a painter’s 5 in 1 or a Swiss Army knife, thoroughly remove all traces of rot in the wood. Cut around and gouge out the infected area. A wood chisel can also be a handy tool in this process. Get rid of the conditions that cause rot to grow to prevent it from coming back. This includes checking for leaks, damaged gutters and poor ventilation. [11] X Research source"

If any wood is damaged beyond repair, especially structural damage to roof support posts or railing posts, consider hiring a professional to replace it for you. If you feel like you have sufficient experience, you can replace damaged wood yourself. Remove all rotted wood and an extra three feet of surrounding wood to make sure no rot is left. [12] X Research source Clean all surfaces including steel and pipes within five feet of the rotted area. [13] X Research source Apply fungicide to all surfaces within five feet of the rotted area.

      "content": "Use filler to repair small holes in the remaining wood. Now that you have removed all rot and checked the wood’s integrity, use a solvent-based wood filler to seal all gaps where moisture could penetrate the surface again, especially in corners, seams and edges. Heavy-duty solvent-based wood fillers are designed for outdoor use. You can fill in nail holes, gouges or cracks, having already removed loose and flaking paint on the wood surface. [16] X Research source Ensure the surface is clean and free of dust by using a damp cloth. [17] X Research source Choose a filler that’s best for the job. You want your filler to expand and contract with the wood and not break away. Note that some epoxy fillers need to be mixed first to properly adhere to the wooden surface. [18] X Research source Using a putty knife, apply the filler to the edge of the damaged area such as a hole, and gradually move to the centre. [19] X Research source Always overfill the holes so the filler will shrink down when it dries, ready for sanding. [20] X Research source Smooth over the filled area with a clean part of the knife. Allow the filler to dry. This can take anywhere between 15 minutes to 8 hours, so be sure to read the instructions on the filler. [21] X Research source"

Using a coarse sandpaper of 40- to 60- grit, start by removing the ridges caused by the filler then expand your area to sand the entire wooden exterior surface. For manual sanding, begin with a coarse grit of sandpaper and then finer and finer grits until you achieve the desired smoothness. Always get rid of sanding dust with a vacuum cleaner before advancing to the next grade of sandpaper. Consider using an automatic sander to cover the surface area more quickly. You can even use two - one in each hand - but be sure not to cross them over. [23] X Research source The trick here is not to overdo the sanding - most of us sand more than we need to. At the finish, the wood should be smooth and even to the touch."

[25] X Expert Source Patrick Coye Painting Specialist Expert Interview. 22 July 2020. Wash off the remaining dust with a low-pressure hose that won’t break your windows. Scrub the surface with soapy water using a mild detergent and a stiff bristled broom or brush. [26] X Research source Ensure you rinse off the soap residue before finishing."

[27] X Expert Source Patrick Coye Painting Specialist Expert Interview. 22 July 2020. When you are sure that the outside wood has thoroughly dried, use a top quality latex or oil-based primer and apply it to the entire exterior of the house. Latex primer is an inexpensive, all-purpose choice. Bring your final paint sample when purchasing primer. Primers are usually white, but tinted ones are available to match your top coat. [28] X Research source Lay down a drop cloth to protect the ground and any plants in the area. Stir the primer well from the bottom of the tin to mix up all the solids that may have separated, and consider using a tray liner for your paint tray. [29] X Research source You can use a nylon-polyester brush, roller or an airless paint sprayer to apply the primer. [30] X Research source Start by priming the patched filler spots, then work your way down from the top of the outside wall to the bottom. Priming the patched areas first can improve the final paint job. [31] X Research source Let the primer sit for 24 hours to ensure it is completely dry."

Before you begin, mask windows and doors with heavy plastic and once again lay drop cloths on the ground. [33] X Research source For primed, bare wood, you will need about one gallon of paint per each 400 square feet. [34] X Research source Use a nylon and polyester brush for latex exterior paint or a paint sprayer for a faster job. Always start at the top and work down so that drips are erased as you work.

While it may seem like an extra expense at the time, you will save yourself time and money on future repairs by properly investing in the repair process now. If you can, you should always apply two finish coats, each within two weeks of each other. [36] X Research source After you’ve painted the body of the house, proceed to the trim, using an oil-based paint. Brushwork is best for applying trim tidily.
