Pessimism, for example, is an excellent example of avoidable stress we put ourselves through. Instead of focusing on the negatives and the problems that are causing you anxiety, concentrate on the positives. [9] X Research source [10] X Research source Negative thoughts lead to a negative mood state and positive thoughts lead to a positive mood state. When you feel down, pay attention to your thoughts. What have you been telling yourself? Try to spin negative thoughts into positives. For example, you may think to yourself \"I'll never finish all my work.\" Change this thought by spinning it: \"If I work at a steady pace and take regular breaks, I can knock this work out in __ hours.\" When you change your viewpoint, you can change your level of stress altogether.

So if you're catastrophizing because you've been running late (and you are thinking \"I'm going to be fired\"), your \"for\" column might look like: \"I was late twice last week and they're not going to tolerate me being late again;\" while your \"against\" column might look like: \"My boss said he understands that I have to drop my son off at preschool before I can drive to work,\" \"We have a time and attendance policy that allows me to be late a certain number of times, and I'm nowhere near that point,\" and so on."

[11] X Research source Write honestly and without fear. Your journal is only for you: no one else needs to read it or see what is stressing you out. It is a safe, judgment-free place to get out all your worries, emotions, thoughts, and feelings. [12] X Research source Once your thoughts are down on paper, they will no longer be taking up space in your brain. Journaling can help you experience clarity and see the source of your stress. Write out your problems to organize your thoughts. When your thoughts are not organized, you can't think clearly, which leads to confusion and stress. If you have a problem and can't decide between two solutions, make a two-column pros and cons list (for and against), such as dividing a sheet of paper down the center to compare two ways to handle that situation."

Keep track of your schedule to clearly acknowledge when you do not have the time or resources to take on extra tasks. Assertive people maintain eye contact, speak in a clear and non-threatening tone while standing up for themselves. If you know that you are already overbooked, say so. It's okay to say \"no\" when you do it in a way that also respects others. Some people take on too much out of fear of missing out on new and exciting opportunities. Yet, they end up not performing as well as they would because they are dividing their energies between so many different tasks or activities.
