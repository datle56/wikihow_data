      "title": "Tell them why you chose that specific gift for them.",
      "content": "Tell them why you chose that specific gift for them. This gives you an opportunity to show the thought and love that went into picking the gift. [1] X Research source If you explained it all in the card, just instruct them to read that first. Your sweet explanation of why you chose the gift may mean more to your partner than the actual gift. It’s a chance to show them how well you know them."
    },
    {
      "title": "Be honest about how you are feeling.",
      "content": "Be honest about how you are feeling. You can let your partner know what it is you love about them, how they make you feel, or anything else you want them to know. As long as you're speaking from you're heart, you're doing it right! [2] X Research source You could say, \"Jaime, I just wanted to let you know how much you mean to me. This summer has been great, and I'm looking forward to spending even more time with you.\" If it’s clear in their face that they don’t like the gift it’s not something they enjoy, don’t be afraid to address it. Tell them that you really want them to have a gift they will adore, and you’d love the opportunity to pick out something new with them."

      "title": "Take the time to write a meaningful and sincere card.",
      "content": "Take the time to write a meaningful and sincere card. Oftentimes, this can be the most memorable and touching part of a gift, so don't leave this until the last minute. Think about the occasion, reflect on your feelings towards the recipient, and don't be nervous about getting sappy. A perfectly written card is the cherry on top of the romantic gift. [3] X Research source Flatter the person you're giving the gift to. Tell them all the reasons why you love them, and why they deserve this gift. For example, you could say, “I love how kind you are and your sense of adventure makes every day with you fun.” Get nostalgic and talk about special moments you've shared. Look forward to the future, and talk about what else you hope to experience with them."

      "title": "Create a romantic atmosphere for the presentation of the gift.",
      "content": "Create a romantic atmosphere for the presentation of the gift. Whether you’ve chosen to present your gift in private or in public, make sure that you’ve set the mood. If you’re at home, candles, flowers, and soft music are all great ways to create an intimate mood. [4] X Research source If you want to give your gift in public, choose somewhere with dim lighting and a sexy vibe. Wine or champagne is a bonus in either scenario! Deciding the atmosphere that works best for your partner is absolutely the most important piece of advice, however."

      "title": "If your partner prefers it, pick a casual location.",
      "content": "If your partner prefers it, pick a casual location. If your partner feels uncomfortable at swanky restaurants or is allergic to scented candles and flowers, go somewhere chill. Worry less about creating the perfect “stereotypical” romantic evening, and more about making your partner feel loved and happy. You could have a picnic in a park or give them a present at your favorite low-key coffee shop."

      "title": "Try presenting the gift in a playful way.",
      "content": "Try presenting the gift in a playful way. Sometimes the process of giving and receiving a gift can be a gift all on its own! If your present consists of multiple pieces, think about giving it piece by piece throughout the day. This will keep your partner excited and feeling loved all day long. If you want to get really creative, construct a scavenger hunt for your love! You can give them clues that will lead them to their gift at the very end. [5] X Research source Don't be shy to enlist the help of your lover's family and friends. They may be able to help you pull off a really fun and special gift presentation."

      "title": "Try having your present delivered to your partner at work.",
      "content": "Try having your present delivered to your partner at work. They will get a lovely surprise in the middle of the day. They probably won't be expecting this and it's a great way to brighten the workday. You can celebrate with them after hours! [6] X Research source"

      "title": "You could also offer your gift when they are least expecting it.",
      "content": "You could also offer your gift when they are least expecting it. For example, try leaving it for them to find when they first wake up in the morning. [7] X Research source If surprises or celebrations make your partner anxious, find a more low-key way to give them a gift. Many people don’t deal well with uncertainty and that is okay. If you’ve noticed that your partner is one of those people, give them a heads up before springing a present on them. [8] X Research source Even if you think a surprise is more fun, try to remember this is about them, not you."

      "title": "Definitely take care with the wrapping to show how much you care.",
      "content": "Definitely take care with the wrapping to show how much you care. Wrap your gift beautifully. By concealing the present in gorgeous wrapping paper and placing it in a beautiful bag, your significant other will be even more giddy and excited at the moment of the big reveal. You can even increase the excitement and anticipation if you leave the wrapped gift in plain sight, before giving them the chance to open it. If you've purchased the gift from a store, ask if the clerk will wrap it up nicely for you. If you're on your own for this part head to a craft store to pick out the best wrapping supplies. If you're not a crafty person and don't know the best way to wrap the gift, check out YouTube! There are tons of tutorials on the best way to present a gift. [9] X Research source"

      "title": "You can go classic and choose your partner’s birthday.",
      "content": "You can go classic and choose your partner’s birthday. Valentine’s Day, your anniversary, or another special date are also great choices. However, if the romantic calendar date falls on a weekday and you’re celebrating on the weekend, you'll have to decide when you want to exchange gifts. If it’s a “just because” gift, then you can give it whenever you think works best. If you opt to wait for your celebration with your partner rather than the actual date, make sure they know something special is coming so they don’t feel like you forgot!"

      "title": "Choose the time of day that works best to give your gift.",
      "content": "Choose the time of day that works best to give your gift. You may see them on the morning of their birthday or your anniversary, but giving a romantic gift may work better at nightfall. However, if your significant other finds early morning to be the most amorous and dreamy time of the day, give them their gift then! Every couple is different, so consider your own personal style while planning the presentation. [10] X Research source The most important thing is to decide when you think your partner would most appreciate receiving the gift."

      "title": "Make a flexible plan for presenting your gift.",
      "content": "Make a flexible plan for presenting your gift. Being organized is great, but be prepared to roll with any unexpected changes. For example, If your anniversary falls on a Saturday but you just found out that your partner’s parents will be visiting all weekend, maybe you should consider presenting the gift early. If you’re giving an extremely romantic gift, you don’t want to create any discomfort or embarrassment by choosing the wrong time. Similarly, if you planned on giving your significant other a sweet letter and gift at dinner but they are having a rough morning, maybe give it to them early to help cheer them up."
