      "content": "Replace all redacted text with [REDACTED]. Start by replacing all the text you want redacted with the word [REDACTED]. You can do a find and replace search to find all the text that needs to be redacted. This will ensure you redact all the necessary text in the document so it is hidden. [1] X Research source For example, instead of noting the personal information of a customer: “Amy Hempel, 1031 SW Park Ave”, you may replace it with “[INFORMATION REDACTED]” or simply “[REDACTED]”. You can also place black squares or rectangles over information you want to redact. The black squares can be created by drawing long squares over the removed text areas and coloring them solid black. Make sure you delete the text underneath the black squares to ensure the black squares cannot be removed somehow to reveal the information. Make sure you do this for all instances and all variations of the information. You may need to do this manually if you use someone’s name in different ways throughout the document. For example, you may list “Amy Hempel” as “A. Hempel”, “Amy Hempel”, and “Ms. Hempel”. You will need to redact all instances of her name. You can do a find and replace search for every variation of her name or go through the document manually and replace them all with [REDACTED]. Save this version of the document as the “Temp-redacted” version. This will ensure you have two copies of the document, one with the original information and one with the information redacted."

      "content": "Copy and paste the text into Windows Notepad. Windows Notepad is a simple-text editor that does not save any of the hidden code found in a text file. This format only saves basic text information so no other text that can be uncovered in the document. This is essential, as you do not want someone to be able to trace back to the original code of the text file, thereby exposing the redacted information. [2] X Research source Select all the text in the text file. (CTRL-A or Edit > Select All) Copy the text in text file. (CTRL-C or Edit > Copy) Paste the text into Notepad. (CTRL-V or Edit > Paste) Save the file in Notepad as the “Text-redacted” version. It will be saved as a text (.txt) file. If you do not have Windows Notepad, you can use WordPerfect, WordStar, and Text Editor."

The document will have no page numbers, tabs, justifications, paragraph numbering, or any bolding, italics, and underlining. You can reformat it before you save it as a redacted file. [3] X Research source To reformat the document, you must close the Notepad file and open the “Text-redacted” text document in your word processing program. Reformat the text in the word processing program but do not change any of the text."

This will ensure you have a redacted document that does not contain any sensitive information and/or any information that can be uncovered or shown. [4] X Research source Convert the text file to a PDF by choosing the PDF format in the list of save file as options. Select PDF and save the file as the “Final-Redacted-PDF” version. Delete the “Text-redacted” and “Temp-redacted” versions so there is no paper trail to the original redacted information. You can now use the “Final-Redacted-PDF” version as the redacted file."

Though you can try using other programs to remove information from a PDF document, they will not be able to remove the hidden information in the document effectively and are not recommended. [5] X Research source The redaction tool option is only available for Adobe Acrobat Pro. It is not available for Adobe Acrobat Reader. [6] X Research source You can try a plug-in made for other versions of Adobe Acrobat, such as Redux. These plug-ins or add-on software can be used to redact information in a PDF file using other versions of Adobe Acrobat. If you have access to the document as a text file, you can go through the redaction process for a text file and then use the final redacted PDF. However, if you only have access to the PDF file and need to redact the PDF file, you will need to try this method."

Keep in mind this method may be time consuming if you have many pages of a paper document that you need to redact.

To make sure you caught all the information that needs to be redacted, you may want to ask a trusted individual to verify that you did not miss any information. Sometimes, having another set of eyes on the document can also help to catch any information that you may have missed. Let the reviewer know what method you used to redact the information so they can test it properly. If you are dealing with very sensitive information that could have legal implications, you may want to consider using a redaction expert. These individuals are trained to do redactions and can verify the document for you to ensure it contains no errors or mistakes."

Check to see if the redacted text is not present in the content. If it is not present, the redaction has been a success."
