      "title": "Wear gloves when pruning to keep your hands protected.",
      "content": "Wear gloves when pruning to keep your hands protected. Tree roses have large, pointy thorns that can pierce or scratch your skin. To avoid this, wear thick garden gloves to keep your hands protected. For best results, use gloves made of leather or thick canvas material. [1] X Research source Handle the stems with care and keep an eye out for thorns as you make your snips. Additionally, it is helpful to wear long sleeves to keep your skin protected."

      "title": "Use sharp garden shears or bypass pruners to make your cuts.",
      "content": "Use sharp garden shears or bypass pruners to make your cuts. You want to make clean cuts to keep your plants healthy. To do this, always use shears with a sharp blade. Bypass pruners feature a curved lower blade which is a bit longer than the upper blade. They work well when pruning canes 3 ⁄ 4 in (1.9 cm) or thinner. [2] X Research source Check your shears for rust if using an older set. If you are cutting canes thicker than 3 ⁄ 4 in (1.9 cm), use a pair of loppers."

      "title": "Clean your garden shears before and after you use them with alcohol.",
      "content": "Clean your garden shears before and after you use them with alcohol. Cleaning your shears prevents the spread of disease to and from your plants, and it also avoids rust. To clean them, use an alcohol wipe and wipe down all sides of the shears. [3] X Research source You can also use an all-purpose disinfectant and clean cloth. Disinfect your shears if you remove any diseased foliage so you don’t spread it to any other plants."

      "title": "Prune after the last frost in early spring to promote new blooms.",
      "content": "Prune after the last frost in early spring to promote new blooms. After the last frost, the tree rose comes out of dormancy and enters the flowering season. This is the best time to prune your plants since it promotes new growth. Tree roses have thin trunks and the tree can easily topple over or snap. Because of this, pruning roses is very important. [4] X Research source Pruning your tree keeps the top balanced and attractive. If you live in a mild area without a harsh cold, prune the tree in the winter."

      "title": "Remove faded flowers in the summer to encourage a quick rebloom.",
      "content": "Remove faded flowers in the summer to encourage a quick rebloom. When your roses start to get discolored or faded, it is time to snip them off. This process is called “deadheading.” To remove the flower, simply use your shears and trim the cane at the base of the flower. [5] X Research source This way, your tree rose will continue to grow new, healthy flowers. You can do this in the late summer and early fall, for example."

      "title": "Trim off long and unwanted stems in the fall so your tree looks great.",
      "content": "Trim off long and unwanted stems in the fall so your tree looks great. You can remove long, unsightly stems or unwanted, unattractive stems whenever you find them, though the fall is a great time to regularly do this. Look for stems that are much longer than the rest or stems that are jutting out in unwanted directions. Then, simply snip them off using pruning shears. [6] X Research source This keeps your stems from snapping in the winter months."

    {
      "title": "Remove all of the leaves so you can easily see the shape of your tree.",
      "content": "Remove all of the leaves so you can easily see the shape of your tree. Snip off any leaves from the stems of your plant. Make your cuts where the leaves meet the stems. This way, you can see the overall form of your tree, remove branches, and create your shape. [7] X Research source Dead leaves can take away precious nutrients from the healthy canes."

      "title": "Snip the canes 1⁄8–1⁄4 in (0.32–0.64 cm) above a leaf node.",
      "content": "Snip the canes 1 ⁄ 8 – 1 ⁄ 4 in (0.32–0.64 cm) above a leaf node. A node is the space on the cane in between 2 leaves. It is best to make your cuts 1 ⁄ 8 – 1 ⁄ 4 in (0.32–0.64 cm) above where a leaf meets the cane. [8] X Research source This way, your roses will grow back healthy and strong."

      "title": "Make your cuts at a 45-degree angle to keep the stems healthy.",
      "content": "Make your cuts at a 45-degree angle to keep the stems healthy. To make your cuts, angle your shears so they are at a 45-degree angle with the stem. Cutting the cane at angle encourages new growth while keeping the plant healthy. [9] X Research source Cutting straight across can weaken the plant."

    {
      "title": "Cut away dead and damaged canes starting at the crown of the tree.",
      "content": "Cut away dead and damaged canes starting at the crown of the tree. Dead canes are dark or brown in color, as opposed to green live canes. When you find brown canes, completely remove them from your tree. This helps your tree continue to grow healthy canes and luscious flowers. [10] X Research source The crown of the tree refers to the top of the branches and leaves."

      "title": "Get rid of any canes growing inwards or rubbing against another.",
      "content": "Get rid of any canes growing inwards or rubbing against another. If you have any branches that touch together or point towards the middle of the plant, snip them off using your shears. You want all of your branches to grow upwards to create an open structure. [11] X Research source Canes growing towards the center make your tree look uneven and unbalanced."

      "title": "Snip off any canes less than 3⁄8 in (0.95 cm) in diameter.",
      "content": "Snip off any canes less than 3 ⁄ 8 in (0.95 cm) in diameter. Thin, weak growth will not promote healthy, blooming flowers. To keep your tree healthy, cut off any canes thinner than a pencil. [12] X Research source This way, your tree will grow new, healthy stems."

    {
      "title": "Remove any stems or leaves from the bottom of your tree.",
      "content": "Remove any stems or leaves from the bottom of your tree. If you notice any unwanted growth around the base of your tree, cut off the stems or leaves. Cleaning up around the base of your tree helps preserve the tree-like shape. [13] X Research source"

      "title": "Cut your stems into a circular shape for a neatly manicured look.",
      "content": "Cut your stems into a circular shape for a neatly manicured look. To make a circle, trim the top of the tree so the sides are smooth and round. Then, make small cuts around the top in a circular shape to give your tree its form. Create a smooth, even shape so your tree has a full, blossoming top. [14] X Research source"

      "title": "Go with an oval shape for a natural, tree-like look.",
      "content": "Go with an oval shape for a natural, tree-like look. To make an oval, keep the top slightly more pointed to create an elongated shape. Trim the sides so they are smooth and round, and then leave a bit more on the top and bottom to create an oval-like appearance. [15] X Research source Your shape does not have to be completely perfect. As your roses grow, they will fill in the shape to create a natural appearance."

      "title": "Shorten all your canes to 3–4 in (7.6–10.2 cm) to create your shape.",
      "content": "Shorten all your canes to 3–4 in (7.6–10.2 cm) to create your shape. To create your shape, take off about one-third of the total length of your canes. Leave 1-3 bud eyes on the cane when you make your cuts. This way, your tree rose has an attractive, compact shape so it can grow gorgeous flowers. [16] X Research source A bud eye is a small bump where a leaf meets the stem, and this is where new flowers start from."
