      "content": "Find 2 trees to hang your hammock between. Look for healthy, sturdy trees and avoid trees that are young and thin. Try to find 2 trees that are spaced apart the same distance as the length of your hammock. If the trees are closer together than that, don’t use them or your body will be resting on the ground when you’re in your hammock. [1] X Research source If the distance between 2 trees is greater than the length of your hammock, you can use chains or rope to make your hammock reach. Just try not to go over 18 inches (45.7 cm) extra on each side of your hammock or it could rip. Look for trees that are at least two arms together in thickness. Be careful not to use a dead tree to hook your hammock."

      "content": "Wrap a tree strap around each tree. Tree straps are fabric straps with a loop on one end and a metal ring on the other. Using tree straps will prevent the trees you hang your hammock on from getting damaged. Wrap a tree strap around one of the trees you found and pass the metal ring through the loop. Repeat with a second tree strap on the other tree. [2] X Research source You can find tree straps online or at your local outdoor supplies store."

      "content": "Hook the tree strap rings to the rings on the ends of the hammock. Use either S-hooks or carabiners to hook the rings together. Make sure the hooks you’re using are designed to withstand heavy loads. Check the packaging before you buy hooks to see how much weight they hold, and make sure to get hooks that will hold at least your body weight. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Adjust the height of your hammock.",
      "content": "Adjust the height of your hammock. If you’re using a hammock with spreader bars (wooden bars on each end of the hammock that keep it spread out), hang your hammock 4-5 feet (1.2-1.5 meters) up the trunk of the tree. If you’re using a traditional hammock without spreader bars, hang it at 6-8 feet (1.8-2.4 meters) up the tree. Slide the tree straps up or down the base of the trees they’re attached to until the hammock is at the right height. [4] X Research source If your body is resting on the ground when you get in your hammock, raise the tree straps up to raise the hammock."

      "content": "Choose 2 walls to hang your hammock between. The distance between the walls should be at least the length of your hammock. Choose sturdy walls that have studs in them that can support the weight of the hammock. [5] X Research source If your hammock is too big for two walls that are facing each other, hang your hammock diagonally instead."

      "title": "Use a stud finder to find the studs in the walls.",
      "content": "Use a stud finder to find the studs in the walls. Hold the stud finder flat against one of the walls, near the section of the wall you want to hang your hammock from. Press the calibrate button on the stud finder and wait for it to stop flashing or beeping. Then slowly move the stud finder across the surface of the wall horizontally. When the stud finder beeps, stop moving it and mark the spot where the stud is with a pencil. Repeat on the other wall. [6] X Research source Test the spot a few times with the stud finder to make sure it’s not a false reading. You can pick up a stud finder at your local hardware store."

If your hammock doesn’t have spreader bars, drill the holes between 6-8 feet (1.8-2.4 meters) high. [8] X Research source"
