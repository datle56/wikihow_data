      "content": "Keep your laptop plugged in when not using it. This will ensure that your battery is fully charged when you turn the computer back on. For example, you might hook your computer up to a charger before going to bed."

      "title": "Close unnecessary applications.",
      "content": "Close unnecessary applications. Any programs which you aren't currently using should be closed in order to cut down the battery drain. If possible, you'll also want to avoid using battery-intensive programs like video players or photo editors."

      "title": "Unplug any unneeded accessories.",
      "content": "Unplug any unneeded accessories. Things like USB flash drives, CDs, mice, and other peripherals will cause your battery to drain faster, so remove these items for a small boost in battery life."

      "title": "Lower your computer screen's brightness.",
      "content": "Lower your computer screen's brightness. Click the square Action Center icon in the bottom-right corner of the screen (or press ⊞ Win + A ), then click the Brightness box until your computer's brightness is down to 50 percent (or lower if you like). Computer screen brightness is one of the largest contributors to battery drain, so this will drastically increase your battery's life if you were using high brightness. If your laptop uses a light-up keyboard, you can disable the light feature by holding down the Fn key and tapping the keyboard icon at the top of your laptop's keyboard (on some computers, you may not need the Fn key)."

    {
      "title": "Keep your laptop's vents clear.",
      "content": "Keep your laptop's vents clear. Your laptop's vents serve to cool down your computer, thus preventing the built-in fans from working too hard. If the vents become blocked by dust or items on your desk, the fans will have to work significantly harder, and your computer's battery life will suffer as a result. Always try to use your laptop in an open, well-ventilated space."

      "title": "Understand that age matters.",
      "content": "Understand that age matters. While you can prolong the life of a Lithium-Ion battery for a while, most such batteries won't make it past the age of three or four without taking a huge dip in short-term lifespan."

      "title": "Avoid using your laptop in extreme environments.",

Some HP laptops, such as high-tier Pavilion notebooks, don't have removable batteries; if this is the case for you, skip this step."

      "content": "Keep batteries stored at an ideal temperature. HP recommends keeping laptop batteries stored between 68°F and 77°F (or 20°C and 25°C). This will prevent them from being damaged by excess heat or cold. It's also a good idea to store your batteries in as dry a climate as possible."
