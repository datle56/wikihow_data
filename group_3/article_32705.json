Pay attention to his body language also. If he's following your body with his, and maintaining eye contact, it's pretty clear he likes you. [1] X Research source Prolonged conversation is another good sign. If he doesn't look distracted and isn't trying to find ways to get away from you, assume he's interested. “I gotta say, I’ve really enjoyed talking to you tonight.” “It’s been great meeting you and I hope we can keep talking!” “I feel really lucky I decided to come here tonight!”"

      "content": "Ask for his number. Be simple and direct. No need to dance around the topic or make a big deal about it. Ask him out for coffee, ask him to go dancing. Just make sure you keep talking once you have his number so you don't give him the impression you view flirting as an endgame. [2] X Research source Better yet, ask him if he’d like your number. This makes you come across more genuinely interested and it gives folks who might be wary of handing out their number an out: if they don’t want to text you, they don’t have to. [3] X Research source Prepare yourself for the eventuality that some guys may say \"no\" when you ask to exchange numbers. Even if you had a nice conversation, they may not want to move things further. That's OK. Everyone encounters rejection. Don't let it scare you away. “Do you think I could get your number? I’d love to text you later.” “Maybe we could exchange numbers and go out some time?” “Can I give you my number? Maybe you could shoot me a text if you want to go out sometime.”"

But if you've gone through the trouble of approaching a guy and you end up getting his number, text him . Invite him out for that coffee, or let him know you'll be going out with your friends. He may want to join. There’s no hard and fast rule about how long to wait before texting someone, but if you wait too long, you risk losing the momentum you had with this guy when you met—or worse, he might think you're playing games. [4] X Research source It's possible that he won't respond to you, or that if he does, you'll find that the two of you don't have much in common, or the attraction isn't there anymore. Either way, be respectful. “Hey, it’s Dan from the other night! It was so great meeting you. What are you up to?” “What’s up! It’s Clay from last night. I’ve been thinking about you!” “Hi, it’s Amal from yesterday! How’s it going?”"

Put your arms in a \"V\" over your head. [6] X Research source Stretch out in your seat or cross your legs and put your hands behind your head.

If you feel good, you'll have more confidence. Try dressing in clothes that you want to see yourself in. If you've always wanted to wear a suit, go out in a suit. The point is to wear something you associate with power and confidence. [7] X Research source Think about other qualities you want to have when you're looking in the mirror, even if they're not physical qualities. For example, maybe you want to be more charismatic or funny. Once you identify things you want to improve, you can start practicing.
