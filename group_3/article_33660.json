      "content": "Wash any dirt and debris off your plastic with soap and water. Mix a few drops of dishwashing soap in 1 cup (240 mL) of warm water to clean the plastic . Dip a soft cloth or sponge into the soapy water and lightly scrub the soiled section. Your goal is to remove as much dirt and debris as possible from the surface, as it may scratch the plastic if you don't. Once the dirt and debris are gone, rinse the plastic with clean water and dry it with a soft towel. [1] X Research source With car headlights or other car plastics, use car soap to avoid damaging the paint finish on your car. If you're cleaning a large object, such as vinyl siding, spray it down with plain water from a hose. If the plastic you're cleaning is small, use a cotton ball and rubbing alcohol. If some of the dirt is stubborn, try a melamine sponge and water to help remove it."

      "content": "Apply masking or painter's tape to protect areas you aren’t sanding. If you're buffing something like the headlights on your car, a light-tack tape helps protect the paint finish around the headlights. After making sure the area is clean and dry, line tape up against the edge of the headlights on all sides. [2] X Research source Use your fingers to smooth out the tape so there are no wrinkles. Painter's tape works well because it’s easy to remove, but masking tape also works."

      "title": "Use toothpaste for shallow scratches on plastics.",
      "content": "Use toothpaste for shallow scratches on plastics. The silica in toothpaste buffs the plaque off your teeth and also works on shallow scratches. Simply put a pea-sized dab on a cotton cloth or even a clean toothbrush and rub the scratched area in a circular motion. Keep working until the scratches are gone. [3] X Research source Wash the paste off to make it easier to see your progress. Apply more and continue to rub the area if the scratches are still visible. This works best on plastics that are injection molded. Identify injection-molded plastics by the small dimple on the bottom. Toothpaste is a very mild abrasive, so it may take more elbow grease to see results."

      "content": "Mix baking soda and water for slightly more abrasive power. Green Cleaning Expert Susan Stocker recommends mixing two spoonfuls of baking soda with enough water to make a thick paste. Use a cotton ball, cloth, or a clean toothbrush to apply the paste to the plastic. Rub the area with small, circular motions to remove the scratches. [4] X Research source Rinse off the paste occasionally to see how your work progresses."

      "content": "Smooth deeper scratches with a buffer for a quick fix. A buffer is a good option for harder plastics like acrylic and polycarbonate. Turn the buffer on and hold the plastic up to it so the surface buffs the scratched section. After a few minutes, the scratch disappears. [5] X Research source It will also work to buff soft plastics, like motorcycle trim. Choose a cotton buffing wheel for removing scratches in acrylic or polycarbonate. Buffing wheel attachments for drills also effectively remove scratches. Simply hold the buffing surface close to the plastic to remove the scratch. Both acrylic and polycarbonate are very hard plastics. Acrylic is tougher than polycarbonate. Identify polycarbonate by its dark edge."

      "title": "Try a plastic polishing compound to remove scratches.",
      "content": "Try a plastic polishing compound to remove scratches. With a 3-part polishing system, start by putting the roughest compound on a rag and rubbing at the scratch in a circular motion until the edges of the scratch are mostly gone. Wipe off the polishing compound . Then, move on to the next roughest, applying it in a circular motion. Once that's worn down the scratch, remove it with a rag. Finally, use the smoothest polisher to finish up. It should leave a smooth, scratch-free surface. [6] X Research source If you're working with polycarbonate, which has a dark edge, start with the second roughest polishing liquid. This method works well on car headlights. A wide range of plastic polishing compounds are available for different types of plastics, including plexiglass, resin, and acrylic. Liquid, paste, and putty-style products are available."

      "content": "Try progressively finer wet sandpaper to remove deep scratches. Start by rubbing the area with 220-grit sandpaper dipped in water. Use a circular motion. After working on it for a few minutes, move to 320- grit sandpaper , then 400-grit . The finer sandpaper produces a smoother finish. [7] X Research source Make sure to get sandpaper for wet sanding so it doesn't fall apart. Sandpaper is also effective for removing scratches on car headlights."

      "title": "Apply finer sandpaper for a shinier finish on all plastics.",
      "content": "Apply finer sandpaper for a shinier finish on all plastics. Start with 800-grit paper dipped in water to minimize friction and heat that may melt and distort the surface of the plastic. Rub the oxidized area in a circular motion to buff it out. After a few minutes, move up to 1,000-grit and then 2,000 grit . [8] X Research source Always use sandpaper meant for wet use to remove scratches from plastic, or it may fall apart as you work."

      "content": "Use a buffing wheel to get a gleaming finish. This works well for soft plastics like motorcycle trim and hard plastics like headlights. Turn the buffing wheel on and hold it with the edge against the plastic. For soft plastics, use a very light touch to get the best shine, and make sure to keep it moving in a circular motion. [9] X Research source If you don’t have a buffing wheel, use buffing papers in 3,000-grit and then 4,000-grit . [10] X Research source"

      "content": "Run a gas torch along the edge of the acrylic to restore the shine. Acrylic plastic is so hard, polishing it with a flame doesn’t cause damage. For a rough edge, hold the acrylic edge up using a flame-resistant glove . Turn the handheld gas torch on and run it along the edge quickly so it heats the edge and smooths it out. [11] X Research source If your acrylic edge has deep scratches, use 320-grit sandpaper first to smooth it out."

      "content": "Try vinegar, water, and brushes to remove oxidation from paneling. Pour 5 cups (1,200 mL) of vinegar into 1 gallon (3.8 L) of water and stir to combine. Spray it on vinyl paneling with a spray bottle. Work on a small area at a time so the vinegar doesn't dry out. Then, scrub the area with a telescoping cleaning brush with soft bristles. Keep moving around the area, spraying and scrubbing until the oxidation is gone. [12] X Research source When you're finished, spray the area down with a hose. For a stronger cleaner, mix 2 ⁄ 3 cup (160 mL) of a household cleaner, 1 ⁄ 3 cup (79 mL) of laundry detergent, and 4 cups (0.95 L) of bleach into 1 gallon (3.8 L) of water. DO NOT use a cleaner with ammonia. Mixing bleach and ammonia creates toxic fumes."

Mix ¼ cup (59.14 mL) of white vinegar, 2 ½ cups (591.47 mL) of water, and ½ teaspoon (2.46 mL) of dish soap in a spray bottle. [13] X Research source Shake the spray bottle, then lightly spray the spoiled plastic. Then, wipe away any dirt and debris with a soft cloth."
