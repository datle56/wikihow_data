      "title": "Distrust & Paranoia",
      "content": "Distrust & Paranoia You’re afraid to be vulnerable around them. You hesitate to express your feelings—especially negative emotions—for fear that they’ll misconstrue your words. You start to imagine scenarios with new accusations, and you’re constantly on edge for another fight. [3] X Research source You might even question your partner’s integrity. For instance, if they falsely accuse you of cheating, you might become convinced that they’ve been unfaithful to you."

      "title": "Avoidance",
      "content": "Avoidance You hesitate to speak up for yourself to prevent conflict. You’re afraid your partner will become angry if you defend yourself. You worry that your words will be used against you. To avoid arguments, you often opt to stay quiet. [4] X Research source Being unable to speak up for yourself can leave you feeling isolated and depressed, especially if your emotional needs go unmet."

    {
      "title": "Resentment",
      "content": "Resentment You feel deeply bitter towards your partner. You know you deserve to be treated better, but you worry your partner can’t be reasoned with. Over time, your sadness and frustration become overwhelming. You may still love your partner, but sometimes that love is eclipsed by anger. [5] X Research source Your resentment may boil over into arguments. Or you may spend days or weeks hardly talking to each other."

      "title": "Confusion",
      "content": "Confusion Their accusations make you question your sense of reality. You might ask yourself, “Am I remembering things wrong? What if I did do the thing they’re accusing me of?” You feel confused and torn. You’re certain your partner is wrong, but their confidence and intensity are making you doubt yourself. [6] X Trustworthy Source University of Rochester Medical Center Leading academic medical center in the U.S. focused on clinical care and research Go to source Gaslighting is a form of psychological abuse in which someone makes you feel like you’re going “crazy.” They may accuse you of lying, doing things you didn’t do, remembering things incorrectly, or being too “sensitive” when you get upset. If your partner is deliberately accusing you of something you didn’t do, they may be gaslighting you."

      "title": "Loneliness & Emotional Distance",
      "content": "Loneliness & Emotional Distance You’ve started to pull away from the relationship. You might spend less time with your partner or text them less often.

      "content": "Feeling Unsafe You sometimes worry for your safety, or your family’s. Your partner may intimidate you by yelling, throwing objects, or threatening you. They may have acted violently towards you or others in the past. You fear that they might physically harm you, your children, or someone else in your household.

    {
      "title": "They’re emotionally insecure.",
      "content": "They’re emotionally insecure. They have low self-esteem and tend to assume the worst in people. In some cases, this could lead them to falsely accuse their partner of lying, cheating, stealing, or some other malicious behavior. Since they have difficulty trusting others, they may refuse to accept their partner’s denials. [9] X Research source Insecure people are often “on guard” for signs that others will hurt them. If your partner is emotionally insecure, they may falsely accuse you of having done something hurtful."

    {
      "title": "They have a fear of commitment.",
      "content": "They have a fear of commitment. They may use false accusations to rationalize their own feelings of distrust, inadequacy, and fear of abandonment. Instead of acknowledging their inner pain, they try to see you as the “bad person” who can’t be trusted. This gives them an excuse to avoid committing to the relationship. [10] X Research source A fear of commitment is another sign of low self-esteem and past trauma."

    {
      "title": "They might be projecting their own behaviors onto you.",
      "content": "They might be projecting their own behaviors onto you. If they’ve cheated, they may accuse you of cheating. If they often lie, they may accuse you of lying to them. Whatever the specifics, they may project their behaviors out of guilt, or to divert attention away from their actions. [11] X Research source They may also assume that others behave and think like them. For instance, if your partner has stolen money from you, they may accuse you of stealing out of the assumption that most people steal."

    {
      "title": "They may be struggling with trauma or mental health issues.",
      "content": "They may be struggling with trauma or mental health issues. For instance, if your partner has been cheated on in previous relationships, they might assume you’ll cheat on them as well. They may also have an anxious attachment style—meaning that they struggle to trust people due to having been mistreated earlier in life. [12] X Research source In rare cases, paranoid or delusional thinking is a symptom of certain mental health disorders. People with these disorders may sincerely believe things that aren’t true.

      "title": "Calmly but firmly insist that the accusations are not true.",
      "content": "Calmly but firmly insist that the accusations are not true. Offer to show them proof that they’re mistaken, if possible (and if you feel comfortable doing so). For example, if they accuse you of cheating, you could refute their claim by showing them texts and DMs between you and another person. If you don’t have proof, stand your ground and calmly ask what you can do to convince them. Don’t feel obligated to let your partner invade your privacy. In the example above, for instance, you may feel uncomfortable letting them see your private messages. Remember that the burden of proof is on your partner to demonstrate that their accusation is true. If their accusation is based on a suspicion or “hunch,” ask them to show you specific evidence."

    {
      "title": "Validate your partner’s concerns, if they’re legitimate.",
      "content": "Validate your partner’s concerns, if they’re legitimate. Acknowledge any feelings or worries rooted in fact. For instance, if you’ve previously struggled with alcohol abuse and your partner falsely accuses you of drinking, you can say “I understand why you’re worried. You would have a right to be angry if I started drinking again.” [14] X Research source Validating their concerns is not the same as “confessing.” Instead, it helps your partner feel listened to, which could make it easier for them to believe you."

    {
      "title": "Communicate fairly and nonviolently.",
      "content": "Communicate fairly and nonviolently. Avoid yelling, interrupting, name-calling, and stonewalling each other. Practice active listening by paraphrasing what your partner says before replying, and have your partner do the same. Use “I” statements whenever possible to avoid attacking your partner. For example, instead of saying “You’re too stubborn to listen,” you could say, “I’m upset because you won’t hear me out.” Ask your partner to clarify their accusations and feelings. For instance, if they’ve accused you of being unfaithful, you could ask “Do you mean that I’m cheating? Or do you feel I’ve been emotionally distant lately?” Set healthy rules and boundaries for your conversations. For example, your partner should be allowed to ask questions about your behavior, but not make false accusations."

      "title": "Give each other time to cool off when you’re angry.",
      "content": "Give each other time to cool off when you’re angry. Avoid discussing the accusations when one or both of you are upset. Set aside a specific block of time to talk things over, and ask to pause the conversation if things get too heated. You could say, “I need a few minutes to think,” or “Can we continue talking about this after dinner?” [15] X Research source Give each other permission to speak uninterrupted. This ensures both of you feel heard and understood, and prevents the discussion from escalating into an argument."

Encourage them to see a psychiatrist to manage severe symptoms of anxiety, depression, substance abuse, or other mental health disorders. [16] X Research source Some people—especially men—are hesitant to seek help for mental health issues. If necessary, remind your partner that they deserve to feel better and that there is no shame in seeking treatment."

A skilled couple’s therapist can help you address underlying issues in your relationship, including issues related to trauma, mental health, family dynamics, and substance abuse. They can also help you navigate disagreements and practice good communication. [17] X Research source A therapist can also help you confront specific accusations in a safe, supportive environment."
