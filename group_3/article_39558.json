      "content": "Ask yourself why your sibling is behaving this way. Are they lonely? Maybe they just want to play. In that, are they trying to get your attention case, offer to spend more time with them. and don't know how to express it, especially if they're young? Try sharing a few things within your comfort zone. You can devote a bin in your room to things they are allowed to touch (and that are age appropriate). Let them know what the box is for, you might say: \"Layla, I would like you to stay away from my action figures, but you can play with the coloring books and Barbie dolls\"."

    {
      "title": "Ask them.",
      "content": "Ask them. The only way to know what your sibling is feeling is to ask them. Put some time aside to have a private conversation with your sibling about what is driving them to invade your privacy. Be calm and cordial. Let them know that what they're doing is a breach of trust in a calm, respectful manner. Don't make it seem like they're in trouble. Avoid being condescending."

      "title": "Tell them nicely but seriously that you need to be alone, and thank them as they leave.",
      "content": "Tell them nicely but seriously that you need to be alone, and thank them as they leave. Be kind. Don’t push your siblings out of your room or slam the door in their faces. Your siblings are more likely to be respectful to you if you’re respectful to them. Try saying, “I like spending time with you, but I have to study right now, okay?” Try talking to your sibling if they are old enough to understand. A helpful conversation may be enough to fix the issue. Ask them directly to stay away from your belongings, but be polite and don't be demanding or condescending. For example, you might say to your sibling: \"Andrew, I've noticed that you've been in my room when I'm not around and I don't like it\". Tell them why it makes you upset rather shaming them. You could say to your sister: \"Elsie, I like playing with you, but I would really appreciate it if you didn't mess up my backpack because it takes me longer to get ready\". You get more flies with honey than vinegar. Be kind and your siblings will be more likely to cooperate."

      "content": "Try to reach a compromise. Consider your sibling’s point of view. Breathe calmly and listen to what your sibling says. Think about what you can do to get along better. You won’t have to worry about the stuff in your room if you and your siblings can reach a peaceful agreement. [1] X Research source For example, don’t assume your siblings are trying to annoy you on purpose. They might be lonely or just bored.

      "title": "Come to a mutual agreement.",
      "content": "Come to a mutual agreement. If you want to effectively keep your sibling off of your turf, establish a contract or mutual agreement. Get together with your sibling and talk about privacy if they're old enough. Let them know what you would like in the agreement and encourage them to add points as well. Make the agreement mutual, meaning both parties uphold the contact. For example, you might agree to stay out of their room if they promise do the same. Print the contract, sign it, and keep it in a prominent place so that you both know what is expected."

They might bother you if they’re feeling neglected. [2] X Research source Find a hobby that you and your siblings enjoy. For example, if you and your siblings like playing board games, you can make a plan to play board games together every Sunday afternoon.

If you’re having a real problem with your sibling taking your things, for example, your parents may want to know about it. You can ask your parents if you could have a lock on your bedroom doorknob. Try saying, “Could you give me some ideas on how to get my siblings to respect my privacy?” [4] X Research source Try asking, “Can you make a ‘knock first’ policy?” If your parents agree to a knock first policy, and your siblings forget, give them gentle reminders.

Your little brother is unlikely to take interest in one of your school textbooks. Remove some of the dirt under a fake plant. Hide your good action figures there and stack the plant on top. You can also make a small incision in a tennis ball. When you squeeze the ball, the opening will be big enough to fit something through, but it will look normal sitting on your shelf"
