      "content": "Clean the potatoes and peel them (if needed). First, scrub your potatoes under running water to ensure that they’re clean. Next, check to see if the recipe calls for peeled or unpeeled potatoes, and peel them if needed. [1] X Research source If your potatoes do need to be peeled, use a potato peeler or a paring knife , and carefully peel them above a bowl or the trash. This makes clean-up a lot easier!"

      "title": "If necessary, cut your potatoes into equal-sized pieces.",
      "content": "If necessary, cut your potatoes into equal-sized pieces. Potatoes take a long time to cook, hence the need to parboil them. If you want to cut down their cooking time even more, consider cutting your potatoes into smaller pieces. [2] X Research source In general, the smaller the potato, the quicker it'll cook. Just make sure to cut them into uniformly sized chunks, so that they all cook at the same rate. Of course, if your recipe calls for whole potatoes, you won’t be able to cut them into chunks. That’s okay—they'll just take a bit longer to parboil!"

      "title": "Place your potatoes in a saucepan and cover them with water.",
      "content": "Place your potatoes in a saucepan and cover them with water. Fill the pot with room temperature water until the water reaches about 1 inch (2 cm or so) above your potatoes. This way, they'll all cook evenly. If you have a large amount of potatoes to parboil, you may need to use a larger pot, rather than a saucepan."

      "content": "Bring the water to a boil and let the potatoes cook for 5-15 minutes. Small to medium potatoes will typically need to boil for about 7-10 minutes, while larger potatoes may need about 12-15 minutes. If you’re parboiling potatoes that you’ve already cut into small chunks, you may only need to parboil them for about 5 minutes. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Remove the potatoes from the heat and drain the water.",
      "content": "Remove the potatoes from the heat and drain the water. Stick a fork into one of your potatoes (or into a potato chunk, if you’ve cut yours into pieces) to check if it's done yet. The potato should have a cooked and soft outer edge, but firmer toward the middle. When they're ready, take them off the heat and drain the water."

      "title": "Place the potatoes straight into cold water.",
      "content": "Place the potatoes straight into cold water. This stops the cooking process immediately. Simply fill a bowl with water and ice, then place your potatoes into the cool water for a few seconds. Your potatoes are now ready to be used as required in your recipe! Parboiled potatoes will not keep for a very long time. Try to use them within 1-2 days after parboiling. If you’re storing your potatoes for later use, put them in a bowl in your fridge. Don’t store them in a plastic bag, as this causes them to sweat and soften more. To extend their shelf life, try freezing your parboiled potatoes. Pat them dry, and place them on a lined cookie sheet in the freezer for a few hours. Once they’re frozen, transfer to Ziploc bags and store in the freezer for 2-3 months. [4] X Research source"

This cuts down on the cooking time and gives your hashbrowns the perfect consistency. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Sautéed mixed veggies Another reason for parboiling is that potatoes take so much longer to cook than other vegetables. For example, if you try to sautée raw potatoes in a pan with broccoli, carrots, and onions, the other veggies will cook much more quickly, leaving you with icky raw potato chunks. If you parboil your potatoes, you can throw them right in with the rest of your mixed veggies, and they should take roughly the same amount of time to sautée ."

      "content": "Parboiling potatoes cuts down their cooking time. When you parboil (partially cook) potatoes before adding them to a recipe, they’ll cook at roughly the same rate as the other ingredients in your dish. Parboiling potatoes also helps you get the perfect crispy exterior and fluffy interior when you’re making roasted, fried, or hash brown potatoes. [9] X Research source Parboiling potatoes is also helpful when you’re meal prepping for the week. When you’re ready to use the potatoes, they’ll cook much more quickly than raw ones would! Just make sure to use them within 2-3 days if you refrigerated them, or 2-3 weeks if you froze them. Note: For dishes that require fully boiled potatoes, parboiling is unnecessary. If you’re making mashed potatoes, for example, you’ll want to leave your potatoes in the boiling water until they’re fully cooked."
