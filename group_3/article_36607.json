      "content": "Let the dry material sit for 2 minutes. Avoid rubbing the dry material into the stain. Instead, let it just sit on top of the stain for a couple of minutes so the stain begins to lift. [5] X Research source This blotting and drying method works well for carpet. Unlike fabrics, you won't be able to toss the carpet in the washing machine."

      "title": "Vacuum up the dry material and check the stain.",
      "content": "Vacuum up the dry material and check the stain. Use a vacuum to suck up all of the dry material that you spread on the stain. Don't use any vacuum attachments that might rub the material deeper. Look at the space to see if the stain is gone. If it isn't, you'll need to deep treat the stain. [6] X Research source If you responded quickly and the stain wasn't deep, the dry material might easily lift the stain."

      "title": "Pour boiling water through the material.",
      "content": "Pour boiling water through the material. If you're treating a stain on a piece of fabric or clothing, stretch the fabric over a large bowl. Position the stain in the center and wrap a rubber band around the outside of the bowl to hold the fabric in place. Bring a kettle of water to a boil and slowly pour the hot water through the stain and into the bowl. [7] X Research source The hot water can loosen the stain and force it out of the fabric. If you're cleaning a fabric stain on a couch, you'll need to remove the cover or cushion to get to the stain."

Stir in 1/4 cup (60 ml) of hydrogen peroxide until it's combined. Apply the solution to the stain and let it just soak in for 20 minutes. Once the stain looks like it's lifting, wash the material in the washing machine. Only use the brightening dish soap solution on light fabrics since it can lighten dark fabrics."

      "content": "Pour boiling water over the stain. If you're removing the stain from fabric or clothing (not carpet), spread it tightly across a large bowl. Secure the fabric to the bowl with a rubber band and pour lots of boiling water right over the stain and into the bowl. The hot water should loosen the stain. [10] X Research source If the stain was light, the water may be enough. If the stain is still there, it should be loosened and easier to treat now."
