      "content": "Place a tape measure diagonally on the screen. Place one end of your tape measure or measuring stick in the lower-left corner of your TV screen, and measure upward to the upper-right corner. Note the distance of the screen from corner to corner. This is how most TV manufacturers measure the screen size that's listed in your TV's packaging or box, as well as in advertisements. The measurement on your TV's box or packaging only includes the screen size. It does not include the frame (also known as the bezel), which can add extra inches to the overall size. If you just want to know the size of the screen and not the whole TV, make sure you are only measuring the screen size and not the frame. To find out if your TV is going to fit on your shelf, you need to measure the entire TV . TVs come in a variety of sizes. Smaller TVs range from 24 in (61 cm) to 32 in (81 cm). Mid-sized TVs can range from 42 in (110 cm), up to 48 in (120 cm). Larger TVs can range from 55 in (140 cm) to 85 in (220 cm), or larger."

You can find the aspect ratio of your TV screen by measuring the width and the length, and then simplifying the two numbers. In most cases, older standard TVs have a 4:3 aspect ratio, while modern rectangular HDTVs have a 16:9 aspect ratio. The devices connected to your TV might have a different aspect ratio than your TV. If the aspect of your TV doesn't match up with your movie, game, DVD, or other video , you may see black bars on the screen or notice blurriness."

While knowing your screen size is useful for finding the proper viewing distance, it won't help you determine if your TV will fit on your shelf or cabinet. To do that, you will need to measure your entire TV, including the frame or bezel. To do so, use a tape measure or measuring stick to measure your TV horizontally (left to right), from edge to edge. Make sure you keep your tape measure or measuring stick level. Some TVs have a stand with legs that protrude out from the sides of the TV. If you are using a TV that has legs that extend beyond the left and right sides, make sure you measure the distance from the edge of one leg to the other to ensure your TV will sit properly on the shelf or stand."

To measure the depth of your TV, measure the distance from the front of your TV to the furthest point on the back of your TV. If the back of your TV is not flat, you can hold a measuring stick against the furthest point from the back of your TV so that it extends past one of the edges. Keep the measuring stick parallel to the front of your TV. If you are using a TV stand, you will also need to include the depth of the TV stand legs if they stick out in front or back of your TV. Measure from the front of the stand to the furthest point on the back of your TV."
