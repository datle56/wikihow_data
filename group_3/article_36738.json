      "title": "Soak the sticker in soapy water, vinegar, or nail polish remover.",
      "content": "Soak the sticker in soapy water, vinegar, or nail polish remover. Dip a cloth in hot, soapy water and place it on the sticker. Leave it on for at least 15 minutes so the sticker absorbs the moisture and begins to loosen from the plastic. If you think the sticker will be difficult to remove, substitute the water for white vinegar or nail polish remover, following the same process. [1] X Research source Rubbing alcohol also works if you need something a bit stronger. A 90% solution works best."
    },
    {
      "title": "Wipe away the solution and scrape off any remaining residue.",
      "content": "Wipe away the solution and scrape off any remaining residue. Scrub the area with a dry cloth to remove the solution, sticker, and residue. Most, if not all, of the sticker should come off without much trouble. Then, use something with a flat edge (a scraper , credit card, or even your fingernail) to scrape off the remaining residue. Be careful not to scratch or puncture the plastic as you do so. [2] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Repeat the process, if necessary.",
      "content": "Repeat the process, if necessary. If any stubborn residue remains after scraping, soak the area again. If you tried soapy water the first time, opt for a stronger solution like vinegar or nail polish remover this time. Repeat as many times as needed until all the residue has been removed. [3] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Wash and dry the plastic.",
      "content": "Wash and dry the plastic. Once the sticker and residue have successfully been removed, scrub the area again with warm, soapy water. This is especially important if you used vinegar or nail polish remover to get rid of any lingering odors. Then, wipe the plastic dry with a clean cloth. [4] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Soak the label in cooking oil.",
      "content": "Soak the label in cooking oil. Apply cooking oil directly to the sticker and let it sit for 10-15 minutes. Canola, vegetable, and other oils will soak into the sticker and loosen the adhesive. After the oil has soaked in, peel the sticker off with a scraper or blade. Repeat the process as needed if the sticker doesn’t come off the first time. [5] X Research source If you suspect the sticker will be difficult to remover, submerge the plastic in a container of cooking oil for 12 to 24 hours. Spraying the sticker with cooking spray also works. Be careful not to cut yourself or damage the plastic if using a blade."

    {
      "title": "Apply a commercial adhesive remover.",
      "content": "Apply a commercial adhesive remover. Some specialty products, like Goo Gone , are specifically designed to remove stickers and other sticky residue. Follow the instructions provided by the product to apply it to the sticker, usually letting it soak for 5-10 minutes, then scrub or scrape the sticker off of the plastic. [6] X Research source Lacquer thinner also works similarly."
    },
    {
      "title": "Spray a degreaser onto the sticker.",
      "content": "Spray a degreaser onto the sticker. Use a degreaser like WD-40 to wipe away the sticker. First, test the product on a patch of the plastic to make sure that it won’t harm the sticker if you plan to keep it. Then, spray the degreaser on a clean cloth or directly on the sticky label or glue residue. Rub in a circular motion with a towel until the sticker pulls away. [7] X Research source"

      "title": "Mix baking soda and coconut oil to remove goo.",
      "content": "Mix baking soda and coconut oil to remove goo. Mix together a paste with 2 parts baking soda to 1 part coconut oil. Apply the paste evenly to the sticker residue, and let it sit for at least 15 minutes. Then, use your fingers or a cloth to scrub and pull away the adhesive. If it doesn’t come off, apply more paste and repeat the process. Wash the container with warm, soapy water when you’re done. [8] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Scrape the residue off with a blade.",
      "content": "Scrape the residue off with a blade. Work the tip of the blade under the residue. Then, move the blade back and forth until the residue begins to come off. Continue using the blade until most or all of the residue has been removed. It’s best to use a plastic blade so you don’t damage the surface of the plastic. [9] X Research source Find blades specifically made for removing stickers on Amazon or similar websites by searching for label and sticker removers. Be careful not to cut yourself."

    {
      "title": "Rub an eraser over the residue.",
      "content": "Rub an eraser over the residue. Vigorously rub the residue with a rubber eraser until the adhesive begins to lift. Continue until most or all of the residue is removed. Use a blade to remove any stubborn bits, or apply a bit of vegetable oil to scrub them off. [10] X Research source"

      "title": "Put peanut butter on the sticker residue.",
      "content": "Put peanut butter on the sticker residue. As strange as it sounds, the oils in peanut butter will break down many adhesives. Cover the sticker residue in a thin layer of peanut butter—any type of peanut butter will do. Let it sit for a few minutes before wiping it off with a sponge and warm, soapy water. [11] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Rub mayonnaise over the residue.",
      "content": "Rub mayonnaise over the residue. Similar to peanut butter, the oil in mayonnaise breaks down the sticky residue leftover from the sticker. Any type of mayonnaise will work for removal. Rub the condiment over the sticker adhesive and allow it to sit for 15 minutes. Then, wipe it off with a dry cloth. [12] X Research source Repeat this process if the residue is thick or does not come off the first time."

      "title": "Use a hairdryer to remove stickers from metal.",
      "content": "Use a hairdryer to remove stickers from metal. Heat helps loosen the sticker glue to make it easier to peel off. Set your hairdryer to warm—not hot—and hold it over the sticker, applying direct heat for 1-2 minutes. After this, the sticker will usually peel right off without leaving any residue behind. [13] X Research source If residue does remain, scrub it away with a bit of hand sanitizer and a cloth or paper towel. A hairdryer may also work for some plastic surfaces, but heat can warp or melt plastic, so it might not be the best option. To remove a sticker from stainless steel , try soaking the surface with oil and then scrubbing the sticker off."

      "title": "Submerge glass in hot, soapy water.",
      "content": "Submerge glass in hot, soapy water. If you have a glass container with a stubborn sticker, fill a bowl or sink with hot, soapy water and let the container soak for at least half an hour. Then, simply peel the sticker off. It should come off easily, but if any residue remains, scrub it off with a sponge. [14] X Research source To remove a stubborn sticker from glass , try soaking the container in a mixture of 1 part vinegar, 3 parts water overnight. For larger pieces of glass, like windows, use a moist cloth to dampen the sticker, then dip the cloth in nail polish remover and rub the area. When the sticker comes off, clean the glass with warm, soapy water or a glass cleaner."

      "content": "Soak wood in vegetable oil or furniture polish. Rub some vegetable oil onto the sticker and let it sit for about 2 hours, then wipe it clean with warm soapy water. For stubborn residue, apply a bit of heat with a warm hairdryer before wiping with the water. Alternatively, dab some furniture polish onto a clean cloth and rub the area. It may take more than one application to fully remove the sticker from the wood . [15] X Research source Before applying any oil or polish, test it in an inconspicuous area to make sure it doesn’t harm the wood."
