      "title": "Cut 2 large square pieces of denim to serve as the patch.",
      "content": "Cut 2 large square pieces of denim to serve as the patch. Look through your closet or wardrobe for an extra pair of jeans, or some other denim garment that you don’t wear anymore. Take a pair of fabric scissors and cut out 2 sections of denim that are around 3 by 4 in (7.6 by 10.2 cm), or large enough to cover the inner thigh area of your jeans. [1] X Research source Cut your patches out of stretchy denim, as this will be easier to work with. You can also purchase pre-made denim patches at a craft or fabric store. It’s better for the patch to be too large than not large enough."

      "title": "Pin the patch to your jeans to hold it in place.",
      "content": "Pin the patch to your jeans to hold it in place. Slide the patch into your jeans without flipping your jeans inside out. Center the patch around the inner thigh area of your jeans, then hold it in place. Secure pins along the edges of inner thighs, holding the patch in place along the inside of your fabric. [2] X Research source The patch will likely be bigger than the section of your jeans that you’re reinforcing, which is completely normal."
    },
    {
      "title": "Sew over the patch in horizontal lines.",
      "content": "Sew over the patch in horizontal lines. Place the pinned section of your jeans beneath your sewing machine and clamp the foot down. Stitch across the inner thigh section of your jeans in straight, horizontal lines, using the back-stitch function to go back and forth, if your sewing machine has that function. These stitched lines will ensure that your patch is really secure, and will help reinforce your inner thigh areas. [3] X Research source Double-check that you’re stitching over the patch pinned beneath your jeans. The back-stitching helps reinforce your patch around your inner thigh area. For a durable finish, use thick denim thread, along with a denim needle, like a 100/16 jeans needle. If you’d like your patch to blend in, choose a thread that matches the color of your jeans.

      "title": "Rotate your jeans and stitch over them with vertical lines.",
      "content": "Rotate your jeans and stitch over them with vertical lines. Turn your jeans 90 degrees, but keep your stitch setting the same. Go back and forth across the upper thigh section of your jeans in consistent, vertical lines. If your machine has it, use the back-stitch function to add an extra layer of support to your stitching. [5] X Research source You’ll want to go over the entire section that you stitched with horizontal lines."

    {
      "title": "Turn your jeans inside-out and cut away any excess fabric.",
      "content": "Turn your jeans inside-out and cut away any excess fabric. Flip your jeans out so the large patch is visible. Take a pair of fabric scissors and cut away any excess denim along the edges of your patch, which will make your jeans more comfortable to wear. Leave 1 ⁄ 2 cm (0.20 in) of space around the stitched edge of your patch so it stays sturdy. [6] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Repeat this process on the other inner thigh of your jeans.",
      "content": "Repeat this process on the other inner thigh of your jeans. Take the second denim patch and pin it in place along the other upper thigh section along the opposite leg. Repeat the same stitches that you did before, using horizontal and vertical lines of stitching to secure and reinforce your patch. Cut off the excess fabric from the patch, and then you’ll be ready to wear your reinforced jeans!"

      "title": "Turn your jeans inside-out before washing them.",
      "content": "Turn your jeans inside-out before washing them. Check each individual garment before you toss it in your washer. Instead of washing your jeans as is, take a moment to flip them inside-out. This will help your jeans last longer after you wash them multiple times, and will keep the outer section of your jeans from rubbing against one another. [7] X Research source As an extra precaution, check the care label on your jeans to see if there are any special laundering requests, like hand-washing or a preference for water temperature."

      "title": "Wash your jeans every few wears so they don’t get worn out.",
      "content": "Wash your jeans every few wears so they don’t get worn out. Don’t launder your jeans every time you wear them—this will cause them to fade and wear out more quickly, which may potentially cause thigh rub holes down the line. Instead, wash your jeans after wearing them at least 3-4 times, or when they start looking or smelling really bad. [8] X Research source"

      "title": "Wear boxers or control shorts with your jeans.",
      "content": "Wear boxers or control shorts with your jeans. Slip on a pair of boxers, boy shorts, or another long undergarment before putting on your jeans. Adding this type of layer to your ensemble may prevent friction and thigh rub holes in your jeans. [9] X Research source These types of undergarments may also prevent chafing."

      "content": "Reduce friction by rubbing clear soap on your jeans. Take a clear bar of glycerine soap and scrub it on the inner thigh sections of your jeans. Do this whenever you put on your jeans, which may prevent long-term friction and eventual thigh rub roles. [10] X Research source"
