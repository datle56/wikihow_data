      "title": "Cushion the contents of the package.",
      "content": "Cushion the contents of the package. Bubble wrap and foam “peanuts” are commonly used for cushioning. How much cushioning you use in your package largely depends on the what you are sending. For example, if you’re sending a book, using bubble wrap should be enough cushioning. If you’re sending something more fragile, like plates, you will probably want to place them in a smaller box and then use bubble wrap and foam peanuts. [2] X Research source Shipping centers will often have free material for cushioning your package."
