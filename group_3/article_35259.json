      "content": "Understand general concepts of precipitation. What most people are concerned with is precipitation, which, in meteorology (the study of weather), is any form of water that falls onto the Earth's surface. Forms of precipitation include rain, hail, snow, and sleet."

      "title": "Recognize what a high pressure system is.",
      "content": "Recognize what a high pressure system is. A major aspect of weather interpretation involves being able to understand the actions caused by differences in air pressure. High pressure implies dry weather. A high pressure system is an air mass that contains denser air because its air is cooler and/or dryer than the surrounding air. Thus, its heavier air falls downward and away from the pressure system's center, like water being poured onto the ground. [1] X Research source With high pressure systems, the weather will tend to become clear or clearing."

    {
      "title": "Understand what a low pressure system is.",
      "content": "Understand what a low pressure system is. Low pressure is usually associated with humid air and in some cases, precipitation. A low pressure system is an air mass that has less dense air because its air is moister and/or warmer. Surrounding air draws inward toward the low system's center as the lighter air balloons upward, often causing clouds or precipitation because that moist air cools as it rises. [2] X Research source You see this effect when air's invisible water vapor is forced to condense into droplets when it contacts the outside of a cold glass). But droplets won't form if the glass is only slightly cool ...thus, rising low pressure air will only produce rain if it gets up where the air is cool enough to condense the water vapor into droplets too heavy to be kept aloft by the rising air. (Clouds are simply water droplets that are small enough to be kept aloft). With very low pressure systems, storms are on the way (if they aren't there already). Clouds begin to form and move across the sky -thunderhead clouds forming when moist air is thrust very high. Sometimes tornadoes form when very high pressure air collides with very warm, moist low pressure air."

      "title": "Study a weather map.",
      "content": "Study a weather map. Watch out for one on the TV news, online, or in your local newspaper. (Other sources may include magazines and books, but they may not be current.) Newspapers are a convenient method to find a weather map as they are cheap, reliable, and can be cut apart so you can carry them with you while learning to interpret the symbols."

    {
      "title": "Analyze a small portion of your weather map.",
      "content": "Analyze a small portion of your weather map. If possible, find a map covering a smaller area – these can be easier to interpret. Focusing on a larger scale may be difficult for a beginner. On the map, notice the location, lines, arrows, patterns, colors, and numbers. Every sign counts and all are different."

      "title": "Understand what air pressure measures.",
      "content": "Understand what air pressure measures. This is the weight or pressure the air exerts on the ground and is measured in millibars. It is important to be able to read air pressure because pressure systems are associated with certain weather patterns. [3] X Research source The average air pressure system measures 1013 mb (29.92 inches of mercury). A typical strong high pressure system measures around 1030 mb (30.42 inches of mercury). A typical low pressure system measures around 1000 mb (29.54 inches of mercury."

      "title": "Learn the air pressure symbols.",
      "content": "Learn the air pressure symbols. To read air pressure on a surface analysis weather map, check for isobars (iso = equal, bar = pressure) – plain, curved lines that indicate areas of equal air pressure. Isobars play a major role in determining the speed and direction of wind. [4] X Research source When the isobars form concentric closed (but not always round) circles, the smallest circle in the center indicates a pressure center. This can be either a high-pressure system (depicted by an \"H\" in English , \"A\" in Spanish ) or a low pressure system (depicted by an \"L\" in English, \"B\" in Spanish). [5] X Research source Air does not flow \"down\" pressure gradients; it flows \"around\" them due to the Coriolis effect (Earth spinning). Hence, wind direction is indicated by the isobars, counterclockwise around lows (cyclonic flow) and clockwise around highs (anticyclonic) in the northern hemisphere, thus creating wind. The closer the isobars are to one another, the stronger the winds."

      "content": "Learn how to interpret a Low Pressure System (Cyclone) . These storms are characterized by increased cloudiness, winds, temperatures, and chance of precipitation. They are represented on a weather map by isobars that are close together with arrows traveling clockwise (Southern Hemisphere) or counter-clockwise (Northern Hemisphere), usually with a \"T\" in the middle isobar, which forms a round circle (the letter can vary, however, depending on the language the weather report is presented in). [6] X Research source Radar imagery can show low-pressure systems. Tropical cyclones (South Pacific) are also named hurricanes around America or typhoons in coastal Asia."

      "content": "Learn how to interpret a High Pressure System . These conditions indicate clear, calm weather with reduced chance of precipitation. Drier air usually results in a greater range of high and low temperatures. [7] X Research source They are represented on a weather map as isobars with an \"H\" in the middle isobar and arrows showing which direction the wind is flowing (clockwise in Northern Hemisphere, counterclockwise in the Southern Hemisphere). Like cyclones, they can also be shown with radar imagery."

      "content": "Observe the types and movement of fronts. These mark the boundary between warmer air on one side and colder air on the other. If you are close to a front and you know the front is moving towards you, you can expect a change in weather (e.g. cloud formation, precipitation, thunderstorms, and wind) when the front boundary passes over you. Mountains and large bodies of water can distort its path. [8] X Research source On a weather map, you will notice some lines that have semi-circles or triangles on either side, or both. These indicate the boundaries for various types of fronts."

The side the semi-circles are on represent the direction in which the warm front is heading."

      "content": "Study an Occluded front . These are formed when a cold front overtakes a warm front. They are associated with various weather events (possibly thunderstorms) depending on whether it is a warm or cold occlusion. The passing of an occluded front usually brings drier air (lowered dew point). [11] X Research source A purple line with semi-circles and triangles both on the same side represents occluded fronts. Whichever side they're on is the direction the occluded front is going."

These fronts have long continuous rainy periods that linger for extended periods in one area and move in waves.

Isotachs – These are lines on a weather map that connect points where the isotach passes have the same wind speed."
