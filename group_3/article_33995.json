You may not experience any symptoms the first time you have your period though. [2] X Research source Ask your parent about a hot water bottle/heating pad or taking pain medicine to help with your symptoms. The older you get, it will be easier to tell when your period is coming. This is because your period will be more consistent and you will be more used to your period and its symptoms."

      "content": "Recognize when your period starts. Your period will usually begin between the ages of 12 and 14 and above. Menstrual blood will begin to come out of your vagina. This blood can be different shades of red and brown and may include clots. If you have not gotten your period by the time you are 15, you need to talk to your parents and your doctor. [3] X Research source If you feel any wetness, go to the bathroom to see if your period has started. There is a possibility it could just be discharge. Your first period may only last for a few days and be very light. You may only see some reddish and/or brown spots. It should last from two to seven days. You can wear panty liners if you suspect that your period may be starting soon. This will protect your clothes until you can use a pad, tampon or menstrual cup. Period underwear can also be used before your period. There is also less chance of leaking this way."

It is helpful to mark on a calendar or use a phone app to keep track of your period. You will begin to recognize a pattern and know when your cycle will start. Mark the first day your period starts, and then count the days until you bleed again. This will help you figure out the length of your cycle. Your periods may not come every month when you first start your period. It may take up to six years before you have a regular cycle. The average length of menstrual cycle during the first year is about 32 days. [4] X Research source See your doctor if your period comes more often than every 21 days or less often than every 45 days. Also see your doctor if your period was once regular, but you begin to have irregular periods."

Most people start off with pads, but try different products until you find something that you like. Pads and tampons come in different sizes. [10] X Expert Source Rebecca Levy-Gantt, MPT, DO Board Certified Obstetrician & Gynecologist Expert Interview. 3 April 2020. Products that say \"light\" or \"slim\" are for a lighter flow, and products that say \"heavy,\" \"super,\" or \"overnight\" are made for a heavier blood flow. [11] X Research source All menstrual products come with instructions. Read them before you use the products. It will take practice for you to feel comfortable using the products. Take your time and don't get frustrated. Do not use scented menstrual products. These products can irritate your skin and vagina. [12] X Research source Avoid perfumes and sprays as well.

      "title": "Know how to use a tampon.",
      "content": "Know how to use a tampon . Tampons are plugs of cotton that you insert into your vagina. You can't feel a tampon once it is inside of you. Most people sit on the toilet, squat, or put one leg up when they insert the tampon. Find a position that works best for you. Inserting a tampon should not be painful, but it may feel uncomfortable at first. [13] X Research source Wash your hands before inserting the tampon. Relax when you insert the tampon. It can be painful if you do not relax. Using a tampon with an applicator will make it easier to insert. You can also buy reusable applicators, which can be used with non-applicator tampons. Change your tampon every three to four hours. You should not wear a tampon for longer than eight hours as this puts you at risk for toxic shock syndrome (TSS). It may be best to wear period underwear, a menstrual cup or a pad when you are sleeping. The reason for not wearing tampons at night is they absorb moisture. This makes the tampon become larger. Since you sleep for a long time, usually the tampon will be larger and possibly a little more difficult to remove. The tampon will also not hold that much, so it may leak during the night. Tampons are good for swimming and sports activities. Use the string on the end of the tampon to remove it. If the string breaks, it is okay. You can gently use your fingers to find the end of the tampon and remove it. [14] X Expert Source Rebecca Levy-Gantt, MPT, DO Board Certified Obstetrician & Gynecologist Expert Interview. 3 April 2020. Do not flush tampons or applicators in the toilet. Thick blocks the toilet and can damage the ecosystem. If you are having problems, ask someone you trust to help you. Using a small amount of water-based lubricant may make it more comfortable for you to insert the tampon. This is especially useful if this is new to you."

Use pads with wings or flaps to help you feel more secure and to better protect your clothes and underwear. [15] X Research source Change your pad every three to four hours. Pads are safe to wear overnight. Reusable pads don't have an adhesive strip, but will instead have a popper to keep it in place. Do not ever flush your pad down the toilet. Wrap it in toilet paper or the wrapping or your new pad and put it in the trash. If you have a reusable pad, put it in the wash after use. Do not go swimming in a pad. The pad will absorb the water and become bulky. If you are having problems, ask your parent or someone you trust to help you."

      "title": "Consider a menstrual cup.",
      "content": "Consider a menstrual cup . Menstrual cups are made of rubber, silicone, or plastic and are inserted into your vagina. They are shaped like small bells and are reusable. The cups can look large and intimidating, but they will fit into your body. Like tampons, you will not be able to feel the cup once it has been inserted properly. Cups are usually more difficult to use than tampons and pads and will take more time to get used to. [16] X Research source Read the instructions that come with the cup for the best way to insert the cup. Instructions will tell you how to insert, remove, and properly clean the cup. Always wash your hands before inserting and taking out the cup. Menstrual cups can safely be worn overnight and for up to 12 hours. To remove a menstrual cup, put your hands inside your vagina and pinch the cup. This will release the cup from your vaginal walls. Once you grip the cup, pull it out and then empty the cup into the toilet. Wash the cup with mild, unscented soap and warm water before reinserting. If you are having problems, ask your mother or someone you trust to help you. Water based lubricants can be used with a menstrual cup. This may make it easier to insert and remove the cup, especially when your period is lighter."
