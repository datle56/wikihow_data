A neat, organized workspace is a place you will be happier to return to after the weekend. [3] X Research source Be sure to acknowledge receipt of emails. A simple \"Thanks\" or \"Got it\" is usually all it takes. It let's the sender know that they don't need to do anything else and can check this task off their list. If you do it, those you correspond with will, too. If you don't have time to get to all your emails, mark as \"unread\" the important ones. This will remove the worry that they will get lost in the clutter by making them easy to locate and respond to."

It may be tempting to get a head start on the week by doing work on Sunday, but that can be counterproductive.

Taking time to recharge your batteries, on the other hand, can make you a happier, more productive worker. Those work emails can wait until Monday.

Keep a log of specific actions, tasks, or times of days that trigger your blues. Write down exactly what you feel, what time it is, and why you think you feel that way. After a few weeks, look for patterns in your log to see what is causing your blues. [15] X Research source Ask yourself what you're really dreading. Acknowledging those feelings—without judging yourself for them—is the first step toward overcoming them. [16] X Expert Source Alexandra Janelli Certified Hypnotherapist & Anxiety and Stress Management Coach Expert Interview. 27 August 2020. If your Sunday blues come from leaving unpleasant tasks for the week ahead until Sunday night to complete, then you can help yourself feel better by changing your weekend and work routine. If your Sunday blues stem from anxiety about an upcoming presentation or assignment due on Monday, allow yourself to acknowledge your nervousness as normal, and then tell yourself that Monday will go well. Set aside prep time that weekend to make sure you are prepared. If your Sunday blues stem from your job, and none of the steps you take to address them work, then it may be time to look for new employment. Schedule a little time on Sunday's to update your resume and search for work. Taking positive steps forward will help you cope with returning to your job the next day. [17] X Research source"

Similarly, if you think of Sunday as the end of the weekend, you'll worry that you haven't maximized your time. But these days aren't ends. They are a part of an unending procession of days and nights, each one a part of a larger process. If you don't finish what you hoped to on Sunday, that's fine. You have the next week to do it. So instead of creating artificial units of time, separate from the rest of life, during which certain tasks have to be accomplished, try to weave those tasks into the overall fabric of your life. [18] X Research source If Sunday evening is approaching and you still have tasks to accomplish, don't try to cram them in that night. Instead, make a to-do list of how you will accomplish them during the week to come. Space out fun activities. Trying to cram all your fun into the weekend can be more stressful than enjoyable. Be sure to space out fun activities over the course of the week. That way you won't be disappointed if your weekend isn't as fantastic as you hoped."

If after adjusting your weekend routine, organizing your Fridays, and trying to make Monday a fun day, you still suffer from the Sunday Night Blues, it is time to get professional guidance to help you explore the deeper causes of your negative feelings. They might stem from experiences earlier in your life, such as fearing school on Mondays because you were bullied or had a learning disorder. Or they might reflect unease with the type of work you do. A professional counselor can help you talk through and, hopefully, resolve your negative feelings."
