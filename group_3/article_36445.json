      "content": "Download cRARk for Windows. You can grab the latest version from http://www.crark.net/#download . cRARk is a command line program that can crack RAR passwords using brute force. As long as the password is fewer than 6 characters long, you have a chance of cracking it with cRARk. [2] X Research source If you are trying to crack a password that's more than 6 characters and you have no information about the password, it's impossible to crack due to the incredibly strong encryption of RAR files. If you know a few characters in the password, you can crack passwords with cRARk up to 28 characters long. Knowing some facts about the password will really cut down on the time it takes to find it with brute force. cRARk supports GPU password recovery using CUDA and OpenCL technologies and works with NVIDIA and AMD GPUs. If you don't have a high-end GPU, finding the password will take much longer."

Only make changes to the section below those hash marks. All lines that begin with one hash # are comments—you'll see that the only uncommented line is the one that says $a * . This means that cRARk will try to brute-force the password using only lower-case letters. Several other examples appear in the file, including the option to search for passwords that only contain numbers, or combinations of both. To use any of these other options, delete the hash symbol from the beginning of its line to uncomment it. The last two options are for if you know part of the password. For example, if you know that the password begins with certain characters and ends with a 4-digit number, you can uncomment the line MyPass $1 $1 $1 $1 and modify it so it fits your criteria. To learn more about different options for the password definition file, see http://www.crark.net/cRARk.html#41 ."

If you want to stop the process, you can press Control + C at the prompt. If that doesn't stop the cracking, just close the command prompt window.
