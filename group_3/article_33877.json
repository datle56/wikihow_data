      "title": "Purchase fresh beetroots.",
      "content": "Purchase fresh beetroots. Choose small to medium-sized beets for a better flavor. Next, examine the beet roots for freshness. The leaves should be perky and green and the skin should be smooth and unbroken. If you’re going to cook the beets, choose beets that are similar in size. Otherwise, they will cook at different rates. If the beetroot skin is wrinkled, the beetroot is too old."

      "title": "Trim the leaves off the beetroot.",
      "content": "Trim the leaves off the beetroot. Leave about 1 inch (3 cm) of stem attached to the root. If you cut the entire stem off, the root will bleed as it cooks. Don’t throw away the leaves! They can be chopped up and added to a stew or salad. Store the leaves in the refrigerator for up to two days."
    },
    {
      "title": "Wash the beetroot.",
      "content": "Wash the beetroot. Gently rinse the root under warm water. Make sure you remove all traces of dirt and debris, especially if you’re serving the root raw. If you’re planning on cooking the beetroots, be careful not to tear the skins or the beetroot will bleed as you cook it."

    {
      "title": "Store the cleaned beetroots.",
      "content": "Store the cleaned beetroots. If you don’t plan on cooking or pickling the beetroots immediately, you can save them in the refrigerator before cooking them. First, lay a plastic re-sealable bag on your cutting board. Next, use a knife to score the bag two or three times. Place your trimmed and cleaned beetroot in the bag and store it in the refrigerator. [1] X Research source Trimmed and cleaned beetroots will stay fresh for about a week in the refrigerator. To help them stay fresh keep them in the crisper drawer. Uncleaned beetroots can be stored in a dark place for three days or in the refrigerator for ten days."

    {
      "title": "Peel the beetroot.",
      "content": "Peel the beetroot. Use a vegetable peeler to peel the skin off the beetroot. Stand over the sink as you work to allow the peeled pieces to fall into an easy-to-clean spot. Be careful where you lay your beetroot as raw beetroot can stain virtually any surface. [2] X Research source If you don’t want the roots to stain your hands, wear gloves while you handle them."

      "title": "Serve raw sliced beetroot as an appetizer.",
      "content": "Serve raw sliced beetroot as an appetizer. First, thinly slice the beetroot, discarding the top section attached to the stem and the pointy tip. Next, toss the beetroot slices with the juice from one lemon and a teaspoon of chili powder. Arrange the beetroot on a plate and garnish with extra chili powder. [3] X Research source Experiment with different spice blends to find one you love. For example, consider substituting cayenne pepper for chili powder. You can also look up variations of this appetizer online for more inspiration."

      "title": "Add shredded beet to a recipe.",
      "content": "Add shredded beet to a recipe. For example, shredded beetroots can be added to any coleslaw recipe to improve the nutritional value and flavor. After peeling the skin, use a cheese grater or vegetable shredder to grate the root into a plastic bowl. Prepare your favorite coleslaw recipe, either adding shredded beetroot or replacing the cabbage completely. If the recipe you prefer uses a lot of sugar, wait to add the sugar until the beetroots are fully incorporated. Then, add sugar to taste. Shredded beetroot can also be added on top of a salad or in a dip."

      "content": "Wrap your beetroots in foil. Choose a heavy-duty baking foil. First, measure out a square of foil and crinkle it slightly. Next, wrap each cleaned and trimmed beet in a loose layer of aluminum foil. Make sure every part of the beetroot is covered."

    {
      "title": "Bake the beetroots.",
      "content": "Bake the beetroots. Preheat your oven to 375° F (190° C). Place the wrapped beets directly on the oven rack and cook them for about an hour. Let the beets cool before handling them. [4] X Research source Test for doneness by piercing the tip with a paring knife. The knife should pierce the skin easily."

      "title": "Peel and trim the cooked beetroots.",
      "content": "Peel and trim the cooked beetroots. First, make sure the beets have cooled. Next, dampen a clean dishcloth. Use this dishcloth to rub away the skin of the beet. [5] X Research source After the beetroot is peeled, cut off and discard the top section attached to the stem and the long pointed tip. The skin of the beetroot should slip off easily when cooked. If not, cook the beetroot for another ten minutes. Remember to wear gloves while working with beets."

      "title": "Make a baked beetroot salad.",
      "content": "Make a baked beetroot salad. Once the beets have been roasted and peeled, chop the beets into bite-sized pieces and place in a serving bowl. Drizzle in some olive oil and toss the beets with salt and pepper. Now you can add nuts, sliced vegetables, pieces of citrus fruit, or soft cheese. Wear gloves while peeling the beetroots to avoid staining your fingers. Serve as a delicious winter salad. Baked beets, hazelnuts, blood orange, and goat cheese are a popular beet salad combination. If you prefer savory combinations, try adding feta cheese and sliced red onions to baked beetroots."

      "title": "Quarter and trim your cleaned beetroots.",
      "content": "Quarter and trim your cleaned beetroots. If you have small, uniform beetroots, you can steam them whole. If you have larger beetroots, cut the roots into quarters before you steam them. Next, cut off the top part of the beetroot attached to the stem and the pointed tip at the end. Discard these pieces. Don’t peel the beetroots before cutting them as the skin will help hold in nutrients and color."

      "title": "Prepare a stovetop basket steamer.",
      "content": "Prepare a stovetop basket steamer. Place a metal stovetop steamer basket on your stove over medium-high heat. Pour about two inches of water into the steamer reservoir and bring the water to a boil. Read the manufacturer instructions before using a stovetop basket steamer. Some steamers have specific limitations on heat and water levels. Stovetop basket steamers can be bought at most grocery stores and baking supply stores."

      "title": "Steam the beetroots.",
      "content": "Steam the beetroots. Add the beets to the basket. Cover the basket with the lid and steam the beets for about 45 minutes. Check the water level periodically and add more if needed. Check for doneness by spearing the beetroot with a fork. The fork should slide into the root easily. Steaming beetroots is faster than baking beetroots. However, steaming is less healthy as nutrients are lost to the water."
