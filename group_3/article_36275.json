[1] X Expert Source Karina Villalta Certified Esthetician Expert Interview. 19 August 2020. Even better, you can make it yourself at home by heating 1 cup (200 g) of sugar, 2 US tbsp (30 ml) of water, and 1 1 ⁄ 2 US tbsp (22 ml) of lemon juice in a small pan. Let the mixture cool, then spread it onto your skin, cover it with a fabric strip, and pull the strip away. As with any wax, this can be a little irritating to your skin, but most people find it gentler than traditional wax. [2] X Research source Sugar wax works best if you're removing hair that's at least 1 ⁄ 4 in (0.64 cm) long—about the length of a grain of rice. Don't skip the lemon juice in this mixture—it helps keep the wax spreadable. [3] X Research source Remove any leftover wax residue with oil. Then, clear away the oil with liquid dish soap.

Start with clean, dry skin, and gently rub the pumice stone over your skin in small circles. Make 2-3 circles in one area, then move to the next one—if you rub too hard in one spot, you might irritate your skin. The results will likely be gradual, but if you keep exfoliating every other day for about 2 weeks, you may start to notice results! [17] X Research source This can be drying to your skin, so be sure to moisturize every day throughout this process. [18] X Research source Don't use a pumice stone on sensitive skin, like on your face, bikini area, underarms, or thighs. You can use any type of pumice stone, but try to find one with smaller holes, since that's likely more effective."

      "content": "For quick results over a large area, go with this classic standby. When you think about removing hair, shaving is probably one of the first things you think about, and for good reason. It's quick, easy, and you get immediate results. You can even reduce your footprint by avoid plastic-handled or disposable razors. Instead, try using a safety razor with replaceable blades. Store your used blades in a safe container, like an old coffee tin with a hole cut in the lid. When it's full, tape it securely closed, clearly mark it, and recycle it at a place that accepts razor blades. [19] X Research source If you prefer, you can use organic soap instead of shaving gel or cream. However, soap may dry out your skin, so be sure to moisturize afterward. Keep in mind that the results from shaving will usually only last from 1-3 days."

      "content": "Pluck out single stray hairs. If you just need to remove a few hairs—like you want to tidy up your eyebrows or you have a couple of unwanted hairs growing under your chin— tweezing is a quick and easy way to take care of them. [20] X Expert Source Melissa Jannes Licensed Esthetician & Brazilian Wax Educator Expert Interview. 30 August 2019. Just remember to always pull the hair in the direction it's growing, and never yank hard. If you pull against the direction of the hair growth or you jerk on the hair, tweezing will be a lot more painful, and the hair could break, leaving you with stubble or even ingrown hairs. [21] X Research source Always keep your tweezers steady and pull the hair in a quick, clean motion. This way, you can remove the hair root without breaking the hair. [22] X Expert Source Melissa Jannes Licensed Esthetician & Brazilian Wax Educator Expert Interview. 30 August 2019. Tweezing is a little painful, but most people get accustomed to it after a while. Since you're removing the hair at the root, the results are longer-lasting than shaving. However, be careful when you're choosing which hairs to tweeze, because some hair may not grow back at all. Tweezing can leave your skin a little red and inflamed, but it should go away in a few hours."
