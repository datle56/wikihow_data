      "content": "This bold song opens reputation with a powerful synth bass and heart-dropping beat. Swift begins with a lyrically dense rap about a budding relationship, comparing the romance to a game of cops and robbers. With the chorus, Swift unleashes a sympathy of breathy notes and synthetic beats. Swift continues the cops and robbers storyline, alluding to the fact that her love affairs and relationships are never secret—her partner has to be “ready for it.” In this song, she takes on the persona of a serial dater, a reputation the media has given her since the start of her career. Swift’s the robber, stealing hearts and running off and never saying sorry. Standout lyrics: But if he’s a ghost, then I can be a phantom / Holdin’ him for ransom In the middle of the night, in my dreams / I know I’m going to be with you / So I’ll take my time And he can be my jailer, Burton to this Taylor Theories: Fans and critics speculate that this song is about Joe Alwyn, Swift’s then-boyfriend. Lyrics like Younger than my exes, but he act like such a man though allude to Alwyn’s young age and boyish look compared to Swift’s past relationships. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "With Ed Sheeran and Future appearing on this track, Swift leaned into her new hip-hop sound. “End Game” is about Swift questioning her reputation and public persona. Before starting a relationship, she has to remember that her love life is “a big conversation.” An endgame relationship is higher stakes because of Swift being in the public eye. As the song progresses, Swift transitions from worrying about what will be said about the relationship to being determined to make the relationship her endgame. [2] X Research source Standout lyrics: And I bury hatchets, but I keep maps of where I put ‘em I swear I don’t love the drama, it loves me You’ve been calling my bluff on all my usual tricks / So here’s the truth from my red lips Theories: There’s some speculation about who “End Game” is about. Some say it’s about Swift and Alwyn’s relationship, while others theorize it’s about ex-boyfriend Calvin Harris because of the line I don’t wanna be just another ex love and Harris’ link between ex-lovers Ellie Goulding, Rita Ora, and Tinashe.

      "content": "Arguably one of Swift’s most memorable tracks on reputation , “I Did Something Bad” starts with a tantalizing, synth strum. In this song, Swift, once again, takes on the persona of a serial dater. This Taylor flies boys all around the world and they never see it coming , what she does next. She speaks directly of the press, saying, They say I did something bad / Then why’s it feel so good? This track is hot, sexy, and all around unapologetic. [4] X Research source Standout lyrics: I never trust a narcissist / But they love me But if he drops my name, then I owe him nothing / And if he spends my change, then he had it comin’ They’re burning all the witches, even if you aren’t one Theories: It’s strongly believed that “I Did Something Bad” is about Calvin Harris and Tom Hiddleston, two of Swift’s exes. The media predicts that Swift broke it off with Harris and quickly rebounded to Hiddleston. Because of this, Swift was accused of being manipulative. [5] X Research source Fun fact: “I Did Something Bad” is the first song Swift publicly swears in. The original lyrics of “Cold as You” (from her debut album) featured a minor, less offensive curse word, but fans don’t count it."

      "content": "Fans have described this reputation track as a “trip to church.” With its chill-inducing harmonies and vocals, this song is deemed to be one of Swift’s most popular. In “Don’t Blame Me,” Swift plays with the media’s portrayal of her as a boy-crazy victim. She leans into the persona, claiming that love is what made her crazy. Swift compares love to a drug, pleading, Lord, save me, my drug is my baby / I’ll be usin’ for the rest of my life . In other words, according to the media, she’s addicted to love. Standout lyrics: Don’t blame me, love made me crazy / If it doesn’t, you ain’t doing it right I once was poison ivy, but now I’m your daisy And baby, for you, I would fall from grace / Just to touch your face Theories: There are no definitive theories about who this song is about. Fans and critics boil it down to a track that claps back against the criticism Swift has received over the years. [6] X Research source [7] X Research source"

      "content": "“Delicate” offers a glimpse into the start of a budding relationship. Track 5 of reputation is a tonal switch for the album. With echoes and intriguing beats, “Delicate” follows the same musical undertones as its predecessors, but the lyrics offer a hint of hope. Swift is vulnerable, explaining to a potential lover, This ain’t for the best / My reputation’s never been worse, so / You must like me for me . The beginning of a relationship is delicate for Swift because of how she’s perceived by the public. And because of that, she treads lightly when catching feelings. [8] X Research source Standout lyrics: Dark jeans and your Nikes, look at you / Oh damn, never seen that color blue Is it cool that I said all that? / Is it chill that you’re in my head? Sometimes when I look into your eyes / I pretend you’re mine all the damn time Theories: “Delicate” is widely believed to be about Joe Alwyn. Swift would later reveal that she and Alwyn met at a dive bar, which is alluded to in the song: Dive bar on the East Side, where you at? In essence, “Delicate” is a song about their first meeting. Fun fact: The “Delicate” music video shows Swift dancing around in downtown Los Angeles, suddenly “invisible” to the public."

      "content": "“Look What You Made Me Do” (LWYMMD) is the leading single off reputation , and rightfully so. This track is a pop hit full of Easter eggs, attitude, and catchy lyrics. LWYMMD was Swift’s re-emergence in the public eye—it was the start of the reputation era . In the song, Swift speaks directly of the feud between her, Ye (formerly Kanye West), and Kim Kardashian. Swift had to reinvent herself because of the public fallout from the feud, causing her to retaliate, shrug, and sing, Look what you made me do . People may have tried to push Swift down, but she got back up with a vengeance. [9] X Research source Standout lyrics: But I got smarter, I got harder in the nick of time / Honey, I rose up from the dead, I do it all the time I don’t trust nobody and nobody trusts me I’m sorry, the old Taylor can’t come to the phone right now / Why? Oh, ‘cause she’s dead Theories: LWYMMD is strongly believed to be about Swift’s feud with Ye and Kardashian. With direct references to Ye, such as: I’ll be the actress starring in your bad dreams and I don’t like your little games / Don’t like your tilted stage . Fun fact: The “Look What You Made Me Do” music video features numerous visual references to Swift’s career and easter eggs about her feud with Ye and Kim Kardashian."

      "content": "“So It Goes…” has the essence of being tangled up in bedroom sheets and hidden love affairs, making it the steamiest and sexiest slow-jam of reputation. The song slowly fades in, featuring Swift’s echoey vocals and pop-synth background beats. With this song, Swift describes a high-speed relationship that’s not necessarily good or bad. Each party has red flags and flaws, but in the end, it’s so simple —they want to be together. Standout lyrics: You know I’m not a bad girl / But I do bad things with you I did a number on you / But honestly, baby, who’s counting? I’m yours to keep and I’m yours to lose Theories: Some critics predict that this song was written around the same time Swift worked on “I Don’t Wanna Live Forever” with Zayn Malik in 2016, thanks to its dramatic sound and sexy lyrics.

      "content": "The eighth track of reputation is a turning point for the album. From here on out, Swift is done showcasing the media’s portrayal of her, done amusing them. Now, she’s telling her own story. “Gorgeous” opens with a child saying, “Gorgeous!” Gone are the deep bass sounds and electronic beats. In their place are playful beats and joyful chimes. Swift’s mood also changes with “Gorgeous.” There’s a hopeful, cheerful lift to her tone, almost as if you can hear her smiling. The song follows Swift as she falls head over heels for a boy with ocean blue eyes. Standout lyrics: Whiskey on ice, Sunset and Vine / You’ve ruined my life, by not being mine If you’ve got a girlfriend, I’m jealous of her / But if you’re single, that’s honestly worse Guess I’ll just stumble on home to my cats / Alone / Unless you wanna come along? Theories: “Gorgeous” is strongly believed to be about Swift’s ex-boyfriend Joe Alwyn. The lyric And I got a boyfriend, he’s older than us / He’s in the club doing I don’t know what could refer to Alwyn being one of Swift’s youngest boyfriends and how she was dating the older Tom Hiddleston at the time. [11] X Research source What Taylor says: Fans who attended a private, secret listening session of reputation before its release (coined the Secret Sessions by Swift) say Swift made them “all promise that if anyone made any accusations of who this song [“Gorgeous”] was about, we tell them it is 100 per cent about her angel boyfriend [Alwyn].” [12] X Research source Fun fact: The child speaking at the beginning of “Gorgeous” is James Reynolds, Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds’ daughter.

      "content": "A fan-favorite song, “Getaway Car,” combines Swift’s imaginative storytelling with Jack Antonoff’s creative rhythms. This upbeat song follows Swift in a love triangle. She’s currently in a relationship, but her heart is with someone else. Swift compares the relationship to Bonnie and Clyde and a high-speed chase. When Swift switches to the other side , no one’s surprised that her heart is no longer in it. All in all, “Getaway Car” is a metaphor for the feeling of wanting to be with someone else when you’re currently with someone. [14] X Research source Standout lyrics: I wanted to leave him, I needed a reason Ridin’ in a getaway car / There were sirens in the beat of your heart But with three of us, honey, it’s a sideshow Theories: It’s strongly believed that “Getaway Car” is about Swift’s switch from dating Tom Hiddleston to Joe Alwyn. Some theorize there might have been some overlap in their relationships. [15] X Research source Fun fact: Jack Antonoff is one of the leading producers on reputation . A good friend of Swift’s, Antonoff has helped produce several of her most popular records."

      "content": "With a soft melodic fade in and rhythmic snaps, “King Of My Heart” is an underrated bop on reputation . This playful song describes Swift’s strong love for a boy—he’s the king of her heart. Swift explains how he’s different from other boys: ‘Cause all the boys in their expensive cars / With their Range Rovers and their Jaguars / Never took me quite where you do. She’s been waiting her whole life to love someone like she loves him. Standout lyrics: Now you try on calling me ‘Baby’ / Like trying on clothes The taste of your lips is my idea of luxury Up on the roof with a school girl crush / Drinking beer out of plastic cups Theories: It’s widely believed that “King Of My Heart” is about Swift’s ex-boyfriend Joe Alwyn. The couple had reportedly met during Swift’s hiatus from the public and quickly fell in love. [16] X Research source Plus, Swift refers to Alwyn’s British mannerisms when she sings Say you fancy me, not fancy stuff ."

      "content": "A break from the more upbeat songs, “Dancing With Our Hands Tied” has a slow beat and a heavier emphasis on lyrics. With this song, Swift details the rough patches of a relationship and the fear of losing it. She worries that her reputation will interfere with her happiness ( I knew there was no one in the world who could take it ). But despite Swift’s worries, the couple dances with their hands tied. Swift wants to hold onto the memories and good times they have together, before the fear of it crashing and burning becomes a reality. Standout lyrics: Deep blue, but you painted me golden I’m a mess, but I’m the mess that you wanted I could’ve spent forever with your hands in my pockets / Picture of your face in an invisible locket Theories: Many believe “Dancing With Our Hands Tied” is about Joe Alwyn and Swift’s relationship during her hiatus, with Swift writing and singing, I love you in spite of / Deep fears that the world would divide .

      "content": "Arguably the sexiest song on reputation , “Dress” crosses a line Swift had never crossed before. Detailing a steamy night with a secret lover, Swift expresses the desire to be with someone privately. At the beginning of the track, the background instrumentals are soft, and Swift’s voice takes center stage. The song is intimate, putting you in the room with Swift herself. Her emotions are only heightened by the breathy notes and exclamations. Standout lyrics: Say my name and everything just stops / I don’t want you like a best friend Only bought this dress so you could take it off I’m spilling wine in the bathtub / You kiss my face and we’re both drunk Theories: “Dress” is known to be about Joe Alwyn and Swift’s past relationship. It’s believed Alwyn and Swift first met at the 2016 Met Gala, where Swift rocked a bleached hairdo and Alwyn had a buzz cut. The lyrics Flashback when you met me, your buzz cut and my hair bleached prove this."

      "content": "Upbeat, catchy, and full of attitude, “This Is Why We Can’t Have Nice Things” (TIWWCHNT) is one of Swift’s most underrated songs. With a hypnotic, electric opening, Swift paints the picture of friends stabbing each other in the back, singing, It was so nice being friends again…But you stabbed me in the back while shakin’ my hand . Each verse describes a new backstabbing scene, with Swift getting more and more ruthless, singing in a mocking tone as if she’s talking to a child. In this case, Swift is the victim, and when asked if she’ll grant forgiveness, she cackles. Standout lyrics: So why’d you have to rain on my parade? / I’m shaking my head and locking the gates This is why we can’t have nice things, darlin’ / Because you break them, I had to take them away But I’m not the only friend you’ve lost lately / If only you weren’t so shady Theories: TIWWCHNT is a direct comeback to Ye (Kanye West) and Kim Kardashian after their public feud drove Swift into hiding in 2016: And therein lies the issue, friends don’t try to trick you / Get you on the phone and mind-twist you .

      "title": "",
      "content": "Fans have deemed “Call It What You Want” the sequel of Swift’s 2008 “Love Story.” This love song describes Swift’s world crumbling around her: My castle crumbled overnight…They took the crown, but it’s alright . She alludes to her disappearance, but she’s doing better than [she] ever was because she has a supportive partner by her side. The man she’s with can see past the drama and misconceptions—he sees and accepts Swift for who she truly is. People can say whatever they want, but Swift knows the truth, and that’s all that matters. Standout lyrics: My baby’s fly like a jet stream / High above the whole scene / Loves me like I’m brand new All the drama queens taking swings / All the jokers dressing up as kings / They fade to nothing when I look at him I want to wear his initial on a chain ‘round my neck…Not because he owns me / But ‘cause he really knows me Theories: “Call It What You Want” is likely about Joe Alwyn, Swift’s then-long-time boyfriend, who stuck with her through all the 2017 drama and her fall-out with the public."

      "content": "“New Year’s Day” is arguably the most heartfelt song on reputation . A drastic change from the rest of the album, this song is acoustic, primarily featuring Swift playing the piano. In this final song, Swift celebrates the person there to help you clean up after a party, the one who stays past the fun. This sentimental ballad highlights the little, cozy, mundane parts of love that are often overlooked. [19] X Research source Standout lyrics: I want your midnights / But I’ll be cleaning up bottles with you on New Year’s Day I’ll be there if you’re the toast of the town, babe / Or if you strike out and you’re crawling home Please don’t become a stranger / Whose laugh I could recognize anywhere Theories: Fans and critics theorize that this song is about Joe Alwyn sticking by Swift during arguably the hardest moments of her life; however, fans have taken this song into their own contexts, allowing it to mean different things for them personally."
