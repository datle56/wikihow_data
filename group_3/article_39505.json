      "content": "Soak your boots in a tub of water for about an hour. It doesn't need to be a lot of liquid, but your shoes should be totally underwater. If they don't get good and soaked, they might not shrink evenly. [1] X Research source Alternately, you can use a wash basin or large bucket. If your boots are made of suede, submerging them might ruin their appearance. Instead, just wet the inside of the shoes and let them air dry in a sunny space. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Put on a pair of socks and dunk your feet in the water. The damp socks will help your boots shrink to the proper size. They'll also spare your feet from the pain caused by the shrinking leather. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Put the wet boots on over your socks. You'll want to do this as soon as you pull them out of the tub, because they'll start shrinking right away. Heads up: getting them on might take a little elbow grease. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Wear the wet boots and socks until the socks dry.",
      "content": "Wear the wet boots and socks until the socks dry. At this point, you can go ahead with whatever you've got planned for the day. As you walk around, the leather will naturally shrink to fit your feet. It may sound uncomfortable, but it's definitely effective. [5] X Research source By the time the socks have dried, your boots should feel much better."

      "title": "Fill up a spray bottle with hot water.",
      "content": "Fill up a spray bottle with hot water. Using a spray bottle lets you target specific parts of your shoe. This is super helpful if your boots aren't all leather and you've only got a few spots to hit. If you don't have a spray bottle, you can use a sponge or an old rag to dampen your boots."

    {
      "title": "Spray the leather outer surfaces of your boots.",
      "content": "Spray the leather outer surfaces of your boots. Don't be afraid to get them nice and soggy, because any dry parts simply won't shrink. Spray from about 5 inches (13 cm) away to avoid making a big mess."
    },
    {
      "title": "Blow dry the outside of the boots with a hair dryer on low speed.",
      "content": "Blow dry the outside of the boots with a hair dryer on low speed. Holding your dryer about 6 inches (15 cm) in from the boots, slowly and evenly pass over each one until they're both bone dry. The key here is to be gentle â€” holding the dryer too close (or running it too hot) can absolutely wreck your boots. The parts you dry first will shrink the most, so start with the parts of the shoe that are loosest on your feet."

    {
      "title": "Try on the boots to see how they fit.",
      "content": "Try on the boots to see how they fit. If either boot is still too lose, spray and dry the boots again in the same way. Repeat until the boots fit properly."

      "title": "Rub leather conditioner into the boots.",
      "content": "Rub leather conditioner into the boots. The conditioner will keep your leather from cracking or peeling following the heat from the blow dryer. Feel free to use lots of the conditioner to make your boots really shine."
