You may be overwhelmed with emotions , but it is important to wipe away the person who hurt you. No matter how you feel, toss away the photos and delete them from your social networking sites, as well as any text messages. Keep gifts from them in a box in case you find them useful at a later point in life. There is no point in holding onto a relationship that isn't meant to work out, so learn to release it by removing all triggers that may bring up old memories and hurt."

Understand that you enjoyed one another for a while, or at least enjoyed the thought of the person. However, although the circumstances seemed fine to you, the relationship would have eventually ended if it was not what your partner wanted for life. Understand that it was good that it ended sooner than later."

      "content": "Write all your feelings down. Release them a journal or write poems. Be absolutely honest and don't edit yourself as you go. One of the best results of writing it all down is that sometimes you will be amazed by a sudden insight that comes to you as you are pouring out your thoughts onto paper. Patterns may become clearer. As your grieving begins to lessen, you will find it easier to discover valuable life lessons from the whole experience if you've been writing your way through it. No relationship/crush is ever a failure if you manage to learn something about yourself from having gone through it all with your heart open to both joy and pain. Just because it didn't work out doesn't mean it wasn't a necessary part of your journey to becoming who you're meant to be. Allow at least the learning part to enrich your life."
