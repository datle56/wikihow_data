      "content": "Shuffle and deal a deck of 52 cards. These should be evenly distributed amongst the players. To keep the game from getting too complicated or lengthy, you should probably keep it from 3 to 6 players, though you can play the game with 2 to 10 players. Some of the players may end up with one more or fewer cards than the rest of the players, but that won't affect the outcome of the game in the long run. Before you begin, remember that the object is to get rid of all of your cards first. [1] X Research source Three or 4 players is the most ideal size for this game."

      "title": "Determine who should go first.",
      "content": "Determine who should go first. It can be the dealer, the person with the ace of spades, the two of clubs, or whoever has the most cards (if the distribution wasn't quite even). This person lays a card (or several) down on the table and tells the other players the type of card they just used. The person who goes first should always start by laying down an ace or a two.

      "title": "Continue putting down the cards clockwise in consecutive ascending order.",
      "content": "Continue putting down the cards clockwise in consecutive ascending order. For example, if the first player put down one or more aces, the next player should put down one or more twos, the third should put down three or more twos, and so on. When it's your turn and you put down your cards, you have to say, \"One ace,\" \"two twos,\" or \"three kings,\" and so on. You may not actually have the cards that you need to put down -- the fun is in faking it. [3] X Research source If you don't have any of the required cards, you can skip your turn though, it's better not to pretend to put down 3 of them -- and definitely not four. If you say you've put down 3 of a card you don't have, it's likely that a player will have at least 2 of the card and will know you're lying and will call \"bullshit!\" You should never claim to have 5 of a card, but you can bluff it if you think the other players aren't paying attention. You can also play dumb. Let's say it's your turn to put down queens, and you happen to have two of them. Say, \"What am I again?\" and look confused as you look through your cards before you put them down. Your goal is to make people believe you when you're lying, and make them doubt you when you're telling the truth."

      "title": "Call \"bullshit\" on anyone who you think is lying.",
      "content": "Call \"bullshit\" on anyone who you think is lying. If you know someone is lying because you have the cards they claim to have in your hand, because they're getting low on cards, or just because you have a feeling they're not telling the truth, then call \"bullshit!\" after the person puts down his cards and announces what they are. This entails an accusation and reveal, in which the person who just played is required to turn over the cards they just put and show everyone else what they actually are. [4] X Research source If the cards aren't what the player said they were and the person who called \"bullshit\" was right, the lying player takes all the cards from the pile and adds them to their hand. If the cards are what the player said they were and the accuser turns out to be wrong, all of the cards in the pile go into the hand of the accuser."

      "content": "Continue play after \"bullshit\" has been called. After \"bullshit\" has been called, another round starts with the last person to play. As the game progresses, it will become more difficult to get away with lying during a round, especially if the amount of cards you have keeps decreasing. In the end, it will come down to luck and how good your poker face is--just try not to make any moves that are too risky, and don't call \"bullshit\" unless you're fairly certain the person playing has indeed lied about their cards.

      "title": "Win the game",
      "content": "Win the game by playing all of the cards in your hand. Once one person has played all the cards in their hand, they are the winner. Of course, most people would call \"bullshit\" on the last play of the game, but you can get around this by making your final play very subtly and quickly, or by calling \"bullshit\" on the person right before you in hopes of starting the next round. Bullshit really is all about strategy, and the more you play it, the better you'll get. [6] X Research source After one player wins, you can continue playing until there are two or three people left if that's how you decide to play. If you only have one card left, don't announce it in advance or let people know that you're about to win. You can also take the bold strategy -- if you only have one card left, you can pretend to count off and say, \"Oh, perfect! I only have one three!\" Though this is more likely to fail than not, you can have fun trying to trick your teammates."

      "content": "Play with two or more packs shuffled together. This is ideal if you're playing with five or more people. It'll make the game last longer and it will be harder to tell who is actually bluffing. [7] X Research source Feel free to use card decks with cards missing or duplicated. This is a great way to recycle decks not suitable for normal card games."

      "content": "Change the sequence of ranks. Instead of playing the cards in ascending order of rank, play in descending order of rank. Start with twos, and then move back to aces, then kings, then queens, and so on. You can also play by going with the next highest or the next lowest rank of the person who went before you. So, if that person puts down a nine, you can put down a ten or an eight. [8] X Research source You can also allow the next player to put down the same card as the player before him or her, or the card below or above that card in rank. This will make it easier for each player to actually put down a card he or she has."

If this rule is in effect, a player can say he's putting down three cards, for example, while sneaking in a fourth card. You can still call \"bullshit\" on this player to check if he actually put down the correct amount of cards; if he lied, then he'll have to take the pile. [9] X Research source"

      "content": "Allow people with all four cards of the same rank to discard them off to the side, when its their turn, face up, telling everyone what rank it is. This helps make a shorter game. If you have for say, 3 nines, try to call BS when someone puts down the nine, hopefully it has a nine, then you can discard the nines. This is great especially if the pile has 3 cards, excluding the nine. Then, the number of cards in you hand goes down. Once the rank is put discarded, skip it next time. So if you or someone else discarded nines, it will go 7,8,10,etc, as long as those ranks are still in the game."
