There’s probably limited space at your friend’s place, so a single-person sleeping bag and twin-size pillow is probably all you should take with you. Make sure the sleeping bag is comfy and warm so you won’t get chilly during the night. [5] X Research source To make your stuff easy to carry, roll your pillow up in your sleeping bag like a burrito.
