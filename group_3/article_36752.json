      "content": "Know when to see a doctor. Most small swallowed items, such as teeth, will easily pass through the digestive tract along with food because they are the size of a pill and too small to cause any blockage— also, they're usually digestible and not a concern for most adults. However, it is possible that the tooth will become stuck somewhere in the digestive system and require medical attention. Small children, especially those who are losing their baby teeth, should be monitored closely in case of choking. Go to a doctor if: The tooth has not passed within 7 days. Vomiting occurs, especially with blood present. Symptoms such as pain in the belly or chest develop, coughing, wheezing, or shortness of breath. You have blood in the stools, especially black or tarry blood. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Keep hydrated and close to a toilet. If recommended by a doctor, you may consider using a laxative to aid in the recovery of the tooth. Make sure to take the right amount of the laxative to avoid overdosing. Overuse of laxatives can have serious effects and lead to dependency, loss of bone density, and a host of other problems causing dehydration followed by an increased heart rate and low blood pressure. [5] X Research source When your stool is fairly loose and/or watery (because of the laxative), place a screen on the toilet to catch the tooth."

      "title": "Be especially aware of your dentures.",
      "content": "Be especially aware of your dentures. Unfortunately, dentures or crowns that have come loose are less likely to be noticed by patients, and the lack of early recognition can present more serious health issues. The nature of dental prostheses' design and the materials used can be more harmful to the digestive tract and organs, as well as being more likely than teeth to become stuck. [7] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source They are made out of metal, ceramic, or plastic and none of these materials is biocompatible and they can harm the digestive tissue. If you wear dentures, check often to be sure they are intact. Do not sleep wearing your dentures. [8] X Research source Partial dentures have metal wires that can break after a while. Make sure that you check your dentures often to see if they are intact or otherwise you may swallow a part of them while you are eating."

      "content": "See a doctor for lost dentures. If you suspect that you’ve accidentally swallowed a denture, it’s best to see a doctor, especially if you’ve experienced any of the pain symptoms mentioned above in regards to teeth. Often the physician will recommend waiting and watching at first, but may also order an X-ray to determine the size, shape, and location of the dental prosthesis. It’s possible that the denture will pass easily through your digestive system. If this is the case, follow the same procedures as with a tooth. When you’ve recovered the denture, clean and disinfect it. This can be done by soaking it in a 1:10 solution of household bleach and water. [9] X Research source"

Vomiting after swallowing a foreign object could cause you to aspirate (inhale) the tooth into your lungs.

      "content": "Use a container. In order to retrieve the tooth, you’ll want to use a container or a sink with the drain closed. As unpleasant as it may sound, try to throw up into a colander that will catch the tooth and allow the watery content to run through, so you can avoid having to search through vomit for a tooth- which may just cause you to throw up more."

What home remedies have you already tried? What symptoms are you experiencing, i.e. pain, nausea, vomiting? Have you experienced a change in your bowel movements? How long has it been since it happened? How did it happen and what were you eating? Did you try drinking any liquids? Did symptoms appear gradually or suddenly?
