[10] X Research source Locomotive cards are wild, so they can be used in any set of Train Car cards. If the route on the board is gray, then you can use any color Train Car cards as long as all the cards you use have the same color. Some cities are connected by Double Routes. A single player can only claim one of the routes. In a 2- or 3-player game, only one of the Double Routes can be claimed, and the other is not used in the game.
