      "content": "Place the table in a large, spacious room or area. You’ll need a space that’s big enough to set up an 8 by 4 ft (2.4 by 1.2 m) rectangular table. Good options include a backyard, basement, or empty garage. [1] X Research source To avoid ruining carpet or hardwood with spilled beer, pick a spot that has durable flooring, like concrete or tile, or somewhere outdoors. If you don't have an 8 by 4 ft (2.4 by 1.2 m) rectangular table, you can use a different size table, as long as it's at least 6 feet (72 in) long. You can use a folding table or make your own table by laying a sheet of plywood on 2 sawhorses or structures of similar height."

      "title": "Set the 4 chairs so they face the table, with 1 chair at each corner.",
      "content": "Set the 4 chairs so they face the table, with 1 chair at each corner. Classic beer die is played while sitting down, so each player will need a chair. Arrange the chairs at the corners of the table, close enough so that the player can place their hand on the table without standing up. [2] X Research source The best type of chair for beer die is one without arms, like a folding chair. Try to line up the chairs so that the 2 chairs on 1 side of the table are directly across from the 2 chairs on the other side."
    },
    {
      "title": "Place 1 cup on each corner of the table.",
      "content": "Place 1 cup on each corner of the table. If you’re following the traditional rules of beer die, set each cup 6 inches (15 cm) from the long side of the table and 12 inches (30 cm) from the foot, or the short side, of the table. For a quick measurement, the width of your closed fist is about the equivalent of how far the cup should be from the side. You can use pint glasses or, if you’re worried about breaking glass, opt for plastic red Solo cups."

    {
      "title": "Fill the cups with 12 ounces (340 g) of beer.",
      "content": "Fill the cups with 12 ounces (340 g) of beer. Use any type of beer you’d like for the game. People most commonly use light beer since it’s easier to drink quickly. Pour your beer of choice into each of the cups on the table. [3] X Research source You can also fill the cups with water or another non-alcoholic beverage if you don’t want to drink alcohol."
    },
    {
      "title": "Divide into 2 teams of 2 people and have each player sit in a chair.",
      "content": "Divide into 2 teams of 2 people and have each player sit in a chair. Only 4 people play beer die at one time. Once you’ve picked your teams, split up the players so that 1 team is seated in the chairs at 1 end of the table, facing the other team who is seated at the opposite end. [4] X Research source You can choose your own teams or, if you want it to be random, draw names out of a hat. If you have more than 4 people who want to play, you can rotate in players throughout the game. You can also create more than 2 teams and have the other teams play the winner of the current game."

    {
      "title": "Set a minimum height that the die must reach on each throw.",
      "content": "Set a minimum height that the die must reach on each throw. This is usually either a height that’s equivalent to the length of the table, which is 8 feet (96 in), or the height of the tallest player. If you’re playing inside, the minimum height can also be 1 foot (12 in) from the ceiling. It helps to have a marker or object to measure each throw against during the game. For example, you might use a nearby light fixture or a door frame as the height so you have a visual."

    {
      "title": "Do not say the numbers “5” or “7” during the game.",
      "content": "Do not say the numbers “5” or “7” during the game. These are known as “bizz” and “buzz” respectively. If you accidentally speak “5” or “7” out loud and someone hears you, both you and your teammate have to take a drink. For example, if you say something like, “Don’t forget the Taylor Swift concert is tomorrow at 7!” while you’re playing, your opponent can make you and your teammate have 1 drink."

    {
      "title": "Have the eldest player throw the dice underhanded across the table.",
      "content": "Have the eldest player throw the dice underhanded across the table. No matter who may have won a previous game, the player who is oldest in age always starts a new game of beer die. Let them lob 1 dice across the table underhanded, with their palm facing up as they release the dice. Some people play with the rule that you have to either tap the dice on the table before you throw or announce that you’re throwing. This prevents the other team from being caught off guard. If you or your teammate is the oldest player, begin the game with your team throwing the dice instead."

      "content": "Catch the dice with 1 hand if it bounces off the table so your opponent doesn't get a point. If you make a successful catch, there are no points scored. If you don’t catch the dice, your opponent gets 1 point. In classic beer die, this is the only way to score a point. [5] X Research source You cannot reach over the table to catch the dice, use 2 hands, or do what is known as “trapping,” which is when you catch the dice against your body. If you make an unfair catch, return the dice to your opponent. They can then do a “shot-back,” which is just a re-throw."

      "title": "Chug your beer if the dice lands in your cup or your teammate’s cup.",
      "content": "Chug your beer if the dice lands in your cup or your teammate’s cup. This is known as either a “plunk,” \"splooge,\" or “sink.” If the dice bounces into either cup, both you and your teammate have to immediately drink whatever is left in your cup. After you chug your beers, refill them with another 12 ounces (340 g) of beer before continuing the game. If you “plunk” your own cup, meaning you knock it over, the game is over and your opponent automatically wins."

    {
      "title": "Throw the dice after both of your opponents have thrown it.",
      "content": "Throw the dice after both of your opponents have thrown it. Alternate turns, with both players per team making 1 throw each turn. Once the eldest player throws, their teammate will take a turn. Then, the dice get handed to the other team. Both players will each throw the dice once before it’s their opponent’s turn again. At any point during the game, you can request what’s known as a “cup check” in between turns. This is when you and your opponents make sure the cups are still in their proper positioning, as they can shift during play."

      "title": "Drink whenever you drop the dice or miss the table on a throw.",
      "content": "Drink whenever you drop the dice or miss the table on a throw. If you toss the dice when it's your turn and it doesn't hit any part of the table, this is called \"heinous\" and you have to take 1 drink. Likewise, if the dice falls out of your hands when you're waiting to throw, it's called \"sloppy die\" and you'll have to drink. [6] X Research source An exception is if your opponent tosses the dice to you to pass it back for your turn and you drop it. You do not have to drink. Know that the other team does not earn points when you have to drink. Drinking and scoring are separate in beer die."

      "title": "Score when you throw the die so it bounces off the table without being caught.",
      "content": "Score when you throw the die so it bounces off the table without being caught. This is the only way to score in beer die, and it's equal to 1 point for your team. Likewise, if the other team throws the die when it's their turn and it bounces off the table without you or your partner catching it, your opponent gets 1 point. [7] X Research source In some variations, you can also score 1 to 2 points if you get the dice in your opponent's cup. However in classic beer die, this is not worth any points."

      "title": "Continue playing until 1 team has a total score of 5.",
      "content": "Continue playing until 1 team has a total score of 5. Keep your own score during the game or have an objective bystander keep track. When either you or the opposing team get to 5 points, it's called \"reaching bizz.\" The first team to do this wins the game. Some variations include playing to \"buzz,\" which is 7 points. Others require you to win by 2 points, and you play overtime until someone does. If you have multiple teams waiting to play, have the winning team stay at the table. Rotate a new team in for the losing team."
