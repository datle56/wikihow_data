      "content": "Type in a destination. You can type in an address or a name of a business, but once it displays at the bottom of the screen, tap the listing that best matches the location based on the locations' address and name. If you've set your Home or Work location, you can also tap the listing to go to this location. However, if you are at one of these locations, your current Saved location will not be shown to you. If your pickup location is different than what Uber says you are at, you may either want to temporarily back out of the chosen box up to the pickup location (top line) and type in the pickup location, or you may want to hold off until a bit later. You can request a ride that has more than one stop using the directions at Request Multiple Stops Using Uber."

THe top two to three choices will be the most common choices for rides, or if you feel you'll need more, you scroll the list up and see two choices for economy rides and Premium rides. However, not all services are covered by every region and your options vary by what's available in each Uber City (location). UberX - The most affordable and most common option for most riders. This option will fit up to four riders. UberXL - A larger, more expensive Uber for groups of up to six. These most often will be minivans and similar, but there are a few out there that aren't but can fit that amount. UberSELECT - A more luxurious (and appropriately more expensive) option. UberBLACK - An expensive, high-end luxury service. UberSUV - A higher-end version of UberXL for parties of up to seven. UberACCESS - Comprises two separate services for disabled riders: UberWAV (wheelchair-accessible vehicles) and UberASSIST (vehicles with specially-trained staff to help elderly or mobility-impaired riders). UberPOOL - For no more than 2 riders in your party and has special restrictions for the pickup and dropoff location. You aren't allowed to schedule an UberPOOL in advance."

Uber uses a variety of payment options including most credit cards (Visa, Mastercard and Discover) along with using their own gift certificate-like account they call \"Uber Cash\". They use Apple Pay (and most other contactless options), if you'd like and have a variety of other ways to build up additional ride credits using special promotions, benefits and other similar programs. You should see your default payment option (e.g., PayPal) listed below the Uber options. To change this option, tap it and then tap Add Payment Method . You can add promotional codes and credit/debit cards here. You can also add cards via the Payment methods button screen found inside the Uber menu when not requesting a ride."
