      "title": "Figure out how much money you need to borrow.",
      "content": "Figure out how much money you need to borrow. Pawn shops are in business to make money, so they will only offer you about 60% to 70% of the true value of your jewelry. Therefore, you don’t want to pawn more jewelry than you have to, especially if you’re unable to repay the loan. Knowing how much money you need on loan will help you figure out the minimal amount of jewelry you need to choose from your collection for pawning."

      "content": "Prioritize your pieces. Try to choose jewelry to pawn that you know you can live without. Pawning family heirloom jewelry might be something you regret later on, but an engagement ring from an old relationship might be easier to part with."

    {
      "title": "Get your jewelry appraised.",
      "content": "Get your jewelry appraised. Pawn shops are usually only interested in pure metals, like gold and silver, and diamonds. They often turn down gold-plated items, as well as costume jewelry. Take your jewelry to an appraiser or jeweler for a free assessment to find out what your jewelry contains and what it’s worth. You can find appraisers and jewelers near you by doing an online search. Remember that a pawn shop won’t typically offer the true value of your jewelry, but it’s good to get an idea of what it’s worth, so you know what to expect at a pawn shop (about 60% to 70% of its true value)."

      "title": "Keep some jewelry on reserve.",
      "content": "Keep some jewelry on reserve. If possible, don’t pawn all your jewelry at once. Keep at least one or two valuable pieces with you in case you aren’t able to pay back the loan on time. That way, you can pawn again if you need to buy some more time so that you don’t lose ownership of your jewelry."
    },
    {
      "title": "Decide how much time you need to repay the loan.",
      "content": "Decide how much time you need to repay the loan. Pawn shops will allot you a certain amount of time to repay your loan. If you do not pay in time, the pawn shop is allowed to keep your jewelry. To ensure the highest chances of reclaiming your valuables, be sure to make an accurate assessment on how long it will take you to repay. Be sure to factor in some “wiggle room” into your time frame. Perhaps add an extra couple weeks into your projected time frame in case something comes up and you aren’t able to produce the money as quickly as planned."

      "title": "Research local and online pawn shops.",
      "content": "Research local and online pawn shops. Not all pawn shops are equal. Some will offer more money for less jewelry and others will have better interest rates or offer longer periods of time to pay back the loan. Do an online search ahead of time to find out which pawn shops offer the best terms based on your needs. [1] X Research source Online pawn shops may be able to offer you a better loan and a longer time to pay it off, but they will be harder to negotiate with, especially if you are trying to pawn rare jewelry."

    {
      "title": "Visit two or three local pawn shops with your jewelry.",
      "content": "Visit two or three local pawn shops with your jewelry. Pawn shops try to remain competitive with each other, so if you decide to pawn locally, visit a few different shops to be sure you are getting the best value for your jewelry."
    },
    {
      "title": "Be careful.",
      "content": "Be careful. Pawn shops can swap your jewelry for cheaper items when you aren’t looking so never let your jewelry out of your sight. If you didn’t get an appraisal done, bring your own scale to showcase the weight of your jewelry. Don’t trust a pawn shop scale. Don’t let a pawn shop talk your jewelry down or appraise it for you."

    {
      "title": "Negotiate at the pawn shop.",
      "content": "Negotiate at the pawn shop. When you’ve found a pawn shop with the right terms for your needs, don’t be afraid to negotiate for the best deal. The pawn shop staff can always decline your offer or offer a counter, so you have nothing to lose by trying. [2] X Research source When you negotiate, allow the shop to make the first offer. You can negotiate the value of the jewelry, the interest rate of the loan, and the time it will take you to pay it back. [3] X Research source Be prepared to walk away if the shop staff isn't willing to give you the terms that you want."
    },
    {
      "title": "Sign a contract.",
      "content": "Sign a contract. Don’t trust a pawn shop that doesn’t offer some sort of contract or agreement that documents the loan. Make sure the terms of the loan, the interest rate, and the timing of loan payback are clearly outlined. Be sure there is also a description of the jewelry included. [4] X Research source Take photos of your jewelry laying next to the contract at the pawn shop in case there are any future disputes about the terms or the jewelry pawned."

    {
      "title": "Pay back the loan on time.",
      "content": "Pay back the loan on time. It’s really important to pay back the loan on time so that you can recover your jewelry safely. Pawn shops can’t resell everything that gets pawned so they will often melt down jewelry into pure metals and sell it at a market price. They can do this as soon as the jewelry is officially theirs. Therefore, your best chance of recovering your jewelry is by repaying the loan by the date and time listed on the contract."
