      "content": "Shadow people are paranormal entities that resemble humanoid shadows. A shadow person, sometimes known as a shadow figure or black mass, is a term used to describe someone’s perception of a shadow-like, humanoid figure, typically seen out of the corner of their eye. Many people believe shadow people are spirits or paranormal entities, while others believe they are a visual hallucination with a scientific explanation. [1] X Research source Shadow people are typically described as dark, indistinct figures with no defining facial features. Witnesses often report feeling frightened by the experience, but this isn’t always the case. Shadow people frequently appear at night, especially to those who suffer from sleep paralysis. They may also appear at times of heightened emotion, like when someone is already feeling fearful."

      "content": "Many people believe shadow people are ghosts or spirits. One of the simplest and most common paranormal explanations for shadow people is that they are a type of ghost or spirit. Many paranormal investigators have reported seeing shadow people, which they interpret as being spirits that reside in the place they’re investigating. Because many people report feeling frightened, many believe shadow people are malevolent spirits or demons, as well. [2] X Research source For example, witnesses who have seen shadow people at Eastern State Penitentiary believe they are the ghosts of former prisoners. Some paranormal investigators, like Chad Stambaugh , have reportedly recorded images of shadow people on video."

Those who believe in astral travel state that we all astral travel when we sleep, which could explain why shadow people are mostly seen at night. Another theory suggests that people in the future have found a way to time travel and appear to us as shadows while they observe our timeline."

Some paranormal theorists believe that there are parallel universes that exist near our own but are invisible to us. According to this theory, shadow people could be beings that can travel between dimensions, appearing in our world as shadows. Similarly, other theorists believe shadow people could be aliens, as many abductees report that aliens can pass through walls and windows and disappear and reappear abruptly, almost like shadows.

When this happens, our brains can misinterpret sensory information or create visual images that we perceive as threats. In this case, we may perceive a normal patch of shadows as a shadow person.

While beliefs about shadow people have always existed, they were not a large part of modern, Western society until 2001, when they were discussed on a late night radio talk show called Coast to Coast AM . [11] X Research source Host Art Bell interviewed a man who claimed to be a Native American elder called Thunder Strikes, and listeners were encouraged to submit drawings of shadow people they had seen. Later that year, author Heidi Hollis published her first book about shadow people, The Secret War , and became a regular on the show.

Some believers report that there are many types of shadow people, and the Hat Man is one of the most well-known.

Witnesses often claim they feel him staring at them, even though he usually has no visible eyes. [12] X Research source The Hat Man has become a meme in recent years, as many people report seeing him after taking too much Benadryl. Taking more than the advised amount of Benadryl is dangerous and potentially fatal, however, so please do not attempt this yourself. [13] X Research source The Hat Man is also commonly associated with those who suffer from sleep paralysis, with descriptions of him dating back to the 2000s."

      "content": "Shadow people are commonly featured in books, movies, and other media. Like many other types of spirits and cryptids, shadow people are sometimes included in pop culture. [14] X Research source Many documentaries and paranormal shows feature witnesses who share their real-life experiences with shadow people, while books, movies, and media include fictionalized accounts. Here are a few examples of shadow people in pop culture: The Nightmare , a 2015 documentary, discusses shadow people and other cultural phenomena (like alien abductions) as potential symptoms of sleep paralysis. It features interviews from participants in the documentary, as well as re-enactments of their experiences. The 2007 novel John Dies at the End features “Shadow Men,” which are beings that can kill a person and retroactively erase them from existence, meaning history is rewritten as if they were never born. The 2013 horror film Shadow People depicts a fictional sleep study in which patients report seeing shadowy figures before dying in their sleep. The film follows a CDC investigator and a radio host as they research the study. In a 2012 episode of Intervention , a subject named Skyler is haunted by shadow people and builds weapons to fight them. He believes the shadow people are using stolen technology to telepathically communicate with certain individuals. In the video game series Deep Sleep , shadow people can paralyze and possess people who lucid dream, and those people are then turned into shadow people themselves. In the Twilight Zone episode “The Shadow Man,” a teenage boy has a shadow person living under his bed. According to the show, shadow people can kill humans but do not harm the person who owns the bed they live under. In the video game LSD: Dream Emulator , a humanoid figure called the Gray Man appears in some dreams to undo dream progress and erase saved flashback data. Shadow people may have also inspired horror characters like Slenderman ."
