Any variety of rose will be a beautiful addition to your garden, but it's important to check which roses will grow best in your region by looking at a regional guide to roses. You can also consider the appearance of the roses as well as their size. Here are several of the most popular and beautiful varieties of roses: Floribunda. These are the most colorful types of roses, and they are bushy shrubs that bloom freely, creating clusters of three to fifteen blossoms instead of just one blossom on a step. These shrubs can be grown individually but look the most impressive when you plant many rows of them next to each other. Hybrid Tea. These are one of the most popular types of roses, which grow as upright bushes that grow one flower per stem. These may be the roses you're most used to seeing at the florist's. Grandiflora. This beautiful variety of rose is a mix between a floribunda and a hybrid tea. It grows up to six feet tall and creates classic hybrid tea flower clusters. Shrub and landscape roses. These roses come in a variety of shapes and sizes and they can suit any landscape. They grow close to the ground, are naturally disease-resistant, and they require less attention than other roses while bearing roses over a long season. Climber roses. These roses add flavor to any garden and typically grow on a fence or a trellis. They have long, arching canes that have many flowers which can cover pillars, walls, or any structure that offers them support. Miniature roses. These are the smallest of the rose plants and they can grow anywhere from six inches to two feet tall. These roses flower continuously and are great for container gardening, making borders, and for growing in a small space. Tree roses. These roses have a hardy rootstock and are grafted to a long stem that is then grafted to a rose bush at its top. The tree rose is visually stunning but it takes more care for it to survive through the winter."

This is an important distinction to make because you will have to plant the roses differently depending on whether they are bare root roses or roses that come in a container.

You can plant these earlier in the growing season, as early as six weeks before your region's last average frost date in spring and not any later than two weeks after that date. If you plant them at the right time and using the right method, these roses will grow faster than container-grown roses. Container-grown roses. These roses have the advantage of already having flowers and therefore looking more beautiful when you plant them in your garden. They're usually sold in 1 gallon (3.8 L) sizes or larger and you'll have to be more careful about growing them in true springtime because they're more likely to get nipped by frost."

Here are some other things to keep in mind as you choose the perfect site for your roses: [3] X Research source Hot climates should have some shade to protect the roses from the hottest sun. Try planting your roses in a spot with morning sun and afternoon shade. Cold climates should have a warm wall or a fence to keep the roses from getting too cold. Your soil should have good drainage. Before you plant your roses, dig a hole and pour water into it to make sure that it drains after just a few hours. If your soil is too moist, the roots of your roses may rot. If this is the case, then you should consider planting your roses in raised beds. Make sure your soil isn't too thick or sandy.
