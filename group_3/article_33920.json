      "content": "Purchase oyster shells. Feed stores sell bags of oyster shells for a relatively small price. These shells are often pre-ground, saving you a lot of work. Both whole and ground shells can be obtained from a number of locations, including grocery stores. Ordering online is always an option. [1] X Research source Ground up shells and those at feed stores are typically cooked before you buy them. At grocery stores and some restaurants, they are often raw. You may be able to get used oyster shells from restaurants. Introduce yourself to owners by saying, “Hi, I live nearby and I could use your oyster shells for my chickens. Could we work out a deal?”"

      "content": "Bake raw oyster shells at 250 °F (121 °C) for 10 minutes. Place the shells on a baking sheet. If you run out of room, crack the shells into smaller pieces by striking them with a hammer. Once the shells are arranged, preheat the oven to 250 °F (121 °C) and let the shells bake for 10 minutes. [2] X Research source Baking kills off any mold or bacteria lingering on the shells. While raw shells often don’t cause harm to the chickens, it is better to be safe than sorry. Baking also dries out the shells, making them easier to crack."

      "title": "Stuff the oyster shells into a bag.",
      "content": "Stuff the oyster shells into a bag. You should break up the oyster shells first so the chickens have an easier time eating them. Start by loading all of the shells into an old sack, pillowcase, or feed bag. These are all safe ways to hold the shells as you strike them with a hammer. Tie the sack shut to protect yourself from flying fragments. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Smash the shells with a hammer.",
      "content": "Smash the shells with a hammer. Bring the sack to a spot that won’t be damaged by hammering, such as the ground outside. Lay the sack flat, then strike it with a hammer or another blunt object. Break the shells down until the fragments are the size of your fingernails. Although the size doesn’t particularly matter, smaller shells are easier for a chicken to pick up with its beak. [4] X Research source You can also drive over the bag with a car to crush the shells quickly."

    {
      "title": "Use a food processor if you want to grind the shells into a powder.",
      "content": "Use a food processor if you want to grind the shells into a powder. Plug in an old food processor or blender. Dump all of the shell fragments into it, then turn on the machine to finish breaking them down. Your chickens will have no problems gobbling down the powder, which can be fed to them in a number of ways. You don’t have to make powder if you don’t want to. Chickens will eat fragments or even whole shells. However, chickens have to peck at the shells to break them if they are too big to swallow."

      "title": "Start feeding oyster shells to hens at 18 weeks of age.",
      "content": "Start feeding oyster shells to hens at 18 weeks of age. Oyster shells, along with other calcium boosters, are only meant for egg-laying hens. Once the hens are 18 weeks old, start purchasing oyster shells. Set the shells out in an accessible location. Within a few weeks, the hens should start laying healthy eggs. [5] X Research source There is no risk of chickens eating too much calcium. If they don’t need it, they won’t eat it. As long as you don’t add it to the food or water, it won’t be an issue. Feeding hens younger than 18 weeks can lead to kidney damage. They only need the calcium boost when they lay eggs."

      "title": "Set the shells out in a feed container inside the coop.",
      "content": "Set the shells out in a feed container inside the coop. Never add the shells to the feed. Instead, set a dish inside the coop or barn. Fill the bowl full of shell powder or fragments. Your chickens will instinctively eat from the bowl when they need the extra calcium. Roosters and younger chickens will avoid it. [6] X Research source A rabbit feeder is another way to keep the shells available. Install it on a wall where the chickens gather. You could also sprinkle some powder on the coop floor or near some plants or grit they peck. They will discover it on their own, but you may find it difficult to monitor how much of it they eat."

      "title": "Provide oyster shells year-round.",
      "content": "Provide oyster shells year-round. Even if you don’t get eggs from your chickens during part of the year, stock the bowl or feeder. Hens still benefit from the calcium. It keeps their bones strong and prepares them to lay more eggs later in the year. If they need it, they will go and eat some. [7] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Give your hens more oyster shells if their eggs break easily.",
      "content": "Give your hens more oyster shells if their eggs break easily. The most recognizable sign of calcium deficiency is thin-shelled eggs. If you notice splattered eggs in the coop or if the eggs break in your hands, calcium deficiency may be the reason. Set out more shells as needed. Make sure they are broken down and placed where the chickens can find them. [8] X Research source Rough spots and wrinkles on the shell are another sign of low calcium. Your chicken’s eggs should look like they belong in a supermarket. Commercial-grade feed does contain calcium. Usually this is enough, but not always. Foraging or table-scrap-fed chickens often need the extra calcium source."
