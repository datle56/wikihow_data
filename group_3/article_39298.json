      "title": "Choose a soap to use.",
      "content": "Choose a soap to use. The trick is to choose something that is able to lather and cover your skin completely. It is also best to choose something that is moisturizing to help glide your razor across your skin smoothly to prevent burns and irritation. Use soap products like: Hair conditioner: Conditioner smooths and softens hair and is a great moisturizing agent. Shampoo: Shampoo lathers quite well and can get rid of pollutants and grease from your skin. Body wash: Body wash acts similarly to shampoo and lathers better than conditioner. For best results, choose a body wash that uses body butter to better moisturize your skin. Dish washing soap: When you've run out of body and hair soaps, dish washing soap is a good alternative that lathers very well. It is a low skin irritant but can be quite drying."

      "content": "Wet the area of the skin that you are going to shave. It's always important to use water to help lather soap onto your body. Shaving without water or any moisturizing agent can cause your razor to glide unevenly and create burns or cuts on your skin. If you're not in the shower or bath, you can get a wet wash cloth or cotton pad and dab it where you want to shave. For best results, shave 10 to 15 minutes after you've been in the bath or shower. The water and heat helps to soften your skin and open up your hair follicles for a better, closer shave .
