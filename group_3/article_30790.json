[1] X Research source You can use a double-boiler instead. The overall process will be the same; just put the ingredients into the bowl or upper pan. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Add 2 tablespoons (30 mL) of heavy cream. This is ideal for 14 ounces (397 g) of caramel. If you used more than 14 ounces (397 g) of caramel, then use more heavy cream; if you used less than 14 ounces (397 g), then use less heavy cream. [3] X Research source The amount suggested here is just for starters. You can always add more heavy cream later if you prefer a thinner consistency. If you don't have heavy cream, try milk instead. You could even use water in a pinch. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Cook the caramels over medium-low heat for 10 to 15 minutes. Give the caramels a stir every 5 minutes with a rubber spatula. Frequent stirring will keep them from burning and help them cook more evenly."

      "title": "Stir in more heavy cream or milk if you want a thinner consistency.",
      "content": "Stir in more heavy cream or milk if you want a thinner consistency. The caramel should be thick enough for coating caramel apples with. If you want to drizzle it over something, like chocolate, add 2 tablespoons (30 mL) of your liquid. If you want to use it as a filling instead, try 6 tablespoons (90 mL). Keep stirring the caramel until the milk, creamer, or water are all mixed in and the color is consistent."

      "title": "Allow the caramel to cool for a few minutes before you use it.",
      "content": "Allow the caramel to cool for a few minutes before you use it. The caramel doesn’t have to reach room-temperature, but you don’t want it to be scorching hot either. Pour any leftover caramel into a jar. Let it reach room temperature, then store it in the fridge. Eat it within 3 months. You will need to reheat the caramel to use it. It will be thinner than it was before you added the creamer and melted it, but you still need to warm it back up."

Place the candies into a microwave-safe dish. Use soft caramel candies, not hard. You can use a larger or smaller bag, but you'll need to adjust the amount of liquid accordingly."

For a richer treat, use heavy cream instead. You can use water, but it may give you a milder flavor. [5] X Research source"

It's ready once you get all of the lumps out. [7] X Research source If you have a powerful microwave, or if the caramel is melting quickly, work in 30-second intervals instead."

      "title": "Let the caramel cool for a few minutes before using it.",
      "content": "Let the caramel cool for a few minutes before using it. If the caramel is still too thick for you, stir in more of your liquid 1 to 2 tablespoons (15 to 30 mL) at a time until you get the desired consistency. Pour any leftover caramel into a glass jar. Let it cool down to room temperature, then store it in the fridge for up to 3 months. Add the liquid before the caramel cools. The caramel will harden a little in the fridge. Reheat it using your preferred method before using it again."

Use a large bowl for large batches of caramel, and a small bowl for small batches. The size of the slow cooker does not matter. As long as the bowl can fit inside it, you are all set!"

You will need 2 tablespoons (30 mL) of milk for every 14 ounces (397 g) of caramel, so plan accordingly. [8] X Research source Don't overfill the bowl. The caramel should be about 1 inch (2.5 cm) below the rim. If you don't have milk, use heavy cream or water. The key here is to keep the caramels moist while they melt."

How much water you use depends on how many caramels you used as well as the size of the bowl and slow cooker itself. The water needs to be level with the caramels. You are essentially creating a double-boiler or bain marie in your slow cooker."

If your cooker has one, take advantage of it. [9] X Research source Make sure that the slow cooker is on a heat-safe surface, such as a tile or granite counter."

Open the slow cooker and give the caramel a stir with a rubber spatula. If you don't see any lumps, you're all set. If you do see lumps, let the caramel cook longer. [10] X Research source Depending on how many lumps there are, you may have to cook the caramels for another 15 to 30 minutes. You can keep the caramel in the slow cooker for up to 2 hours on a WARM setting. This is great if you're dipping lots of caramel apples or serving it at a party. [11] X Research source"

If you put hot caramel into the fridge, the temperature inside the fridge may rise and cause the food to spoil. Use the caramel within 3 months. You can reheat it using whatever method you want."
