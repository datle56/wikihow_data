      "title": "Get the basics set up.",
      "content": "Get the basics set up. Before you can open your franchise, you need to make sure you have all supplies ready to go. You need to buy food supplies from the McDonald's restaurant, figure out how to deal with waste management, and set your hours. In order to buy and sell food, you need to apply for the proper permits in your city. Such permits vary from district to district, so make sure you visit the Department of Health website in your town to find out the rules and regulations. This should also tell you what you need to know about trash disposal. You may need to provide your own private dumpster for restaurant-related trash or you may have access to a community dumpster for restaurants in the area. This depends on your location and the regulations of your city. The McDonald's corporation will mail you the food supplies you need from your restaurant, and you will learn the process for placing orders as well as basic costs during your training. Setting your hours can be complicated. Most cities have regulations as to how early or late businesses can operate by district. You may be in a 24 hour zone, but operating 24 hours can be risky as there's added cost of labor, utilities, and all else needed to keep a restaurant running. To determine your hours, you should see what sort of establishments are in your area and what their hours look like. You should also figure out when the peak hours are for the place where your building is located. Is it most crowded at lunch rush hour or are people more likely to stop by on the their way home from work? Is this a bar district? If so, maybe staying open until 2 or 3AM would be a good idea as people may be on the lookout for food after the bars close."
