      "content": "Set the book against a solid-color background. Keep the focus on the book by placing it on a solid-color background. You can lay it on a solid-color counter, table, or piece of cloth. Consider choosing a background color that contrasts with the color of the book. [1] X Research source For example, put a white book on a solid black cloth backdrop to make it really stand out."

      "content": "Avoid putting props in the photo. Don't place any other items in the shot or the buyer may be confused about what you're selling. Make the book the singular focus of the photograph. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Set up your camera on a tripod, if possible.",
      "content": "Set up your camera on a tripod , if possible. While you can hold a film or digital camera and photograph a book, you'll get steadier results if you mount the camera on a sturdy tripod. A tripod is also useful for when you need to hold the book open to photograph. [3] X Research source You can use a film or digital camera to photograph books. Use whichever you're most comfortable with."

      "title": "Use natural lighting when you photograph.",
      "content": "Use natural lighting when you photograph. Since many books have glossy covers, a camera flash can create glare. Turn off the camera's flash to avoid using artificial lighting. Instead, use the indirect natural light that's available to you. Try to photograph in a well-lit area so the colors of the book are visible. [4] X Research source You'll need to plan on photographing during the day in a room that has good lighting. If natural lighting isn't available, try using a lightbox to control the lighting and shadows. [5] X Expert Source Richard Engelbrecht Professional Photographer Expert Interview. 1 October 2020. Try shooting outdoors in the early morning or evening or on a cloudy day to get a warm look without a lot of shadows.

      "content": "Set up the photograph size, if you're using a digital camera or cell phone. If you're selling the book on a website, check the site's photo size requirements. Adjust your camera or phone settings to select the pixel and image size for the photo. Try to shoot in the highest quality without making an image file that's too large. [7] X Research source For example, if you're selling on eBay, the book photo needs to be at least 500 pixels on the longest side."

      "title": "Adjust the shutter speed.",
      "content": "Adjust the shutter speed. If you're using a tripod, you won't have to worry about adjusting the shutter speed too much. But if you're holding the camera, the shutter speed needs to be higher than 1/50 of a second. If the shutter speed is lower than this, your photo may come out blurry."

      "title": "Set the camera's aperture.",
      "content": "Set the camera's aperture. You'll need to play around and take lots of photos to find the best aperture for each book you photograph. Start around f/16 to get medium depth-of-field and detail. If you find that the title on the book isn't detailed enough, move to higher f-stop. [8] X Research source"

      "title": "Photograph the exterior of the book.",
      "content": "Photograph the exterior of the book. Take a picture of the cover of the book so the entire book is in the shot. Avoid zooming in to just capture the title. Flip the book over and photograph the back. Then, turn the book on its side so the spine is facing up. Take a picture of the spine. [9] X Research source If the book has a dust jacket, you should also take it off and photograph the book without it."

      "content": "Take pictures of the copyright and title pages. Open the book to one of the earliest pages that has the copyright information. Hold this open and take a picture of the whole page. Flip the title page and photograph this as well. Try to keep your fingers out of the shot. [10] X Research source If you're worried you may damage the spine if you press it open, have someone hold the book open a little while you photograph the copyright or title page."

      "title": "Avoid adding borders, text, artwork, and logos.",
      "content": "Avoid adding borders, text, artwork, and logos. Don't add distracting images or text to the photo since these will remove the focus from the book. Many online booksellers won't allow seller logos or borders on the photos. You may be asked to include the title and description of the book in a separate form."

      "content": "Clean your camera lens and turn off the flash. Prevent dust from ruining a picture by wiping the lens with a soft cleaning cloth and cleaning solution. Turn off the flash and adjust the settings to a high resolution.

      "content": "Take a shelfie (a bookshelf selfie) to share your personal style. Remove any trash or clutter from your bookshelves and leave your decorations. Wipe the shelves clean of any dust and make sure your book titles are visible. Photograph a single shelf or a whole bookshelf to give viewers a little glimpse of your personality. Keep in mind that the colors of your decorations should be carefully chosen so the items compliment each other. [12] X Research source For example, if you're showing a soft, romantic style, place pale-colored candles and delicate flowers around the shelf."

      "content": "Add props to highlight your personality. Think about the mood you want to convey with the book you've chosen to photograph. For example, if you've been enjoying a great morning with a good book, photograph the book with a cup of coffee, a notebook, or your breakfast. Depending on the type of book you're photographing, consider placing some of these items in the frame: [13] X Research source Pinecones Scarves Sunglasses Cooking tools Snacks Plants"

      "content": "Use natural lighting to create a snapshot of your life. Since you're not trying to photograph the quality of the book itself, focus on capturing an authentic-looking shot. Photograph your book using the natural light that's available to you. [14] X Research source You can include candles or lamps if you'd like to make the photo feel cozy or warm."

Photograph the page and use a filter or change the contrast so the text is easy to read. Then, click the teardrop icon to access the tilt shift feature. Choose the line to get a linear tilt that will highlight the quote you want. [15] X Research source You can use your finger to change the size of the focus area or move it."

      "content": "Photograph from high-level or at eye-level. If you're taking a shelfie, hold the camera so it's level with the bookshelf. This will give the viewer the sense that they're standing where you are looking at the books. For a single book photograph, hold the camera above the book and shoot down at it. High-angle photos can be as closely focused on the book as you like. If you want to include simple props, you can pull out a little to include the items."

      "content": "Adjust the photographs in post-production, if desired. While many book photos on Instagram appear natural and unaltered, you can adjust the exposure, contrast, brightness, and sharpness of your images. Use Adobe Photoshop to edit your images. If you took the photos on your cell phone, you may be able to use an app to edit your pictures."
