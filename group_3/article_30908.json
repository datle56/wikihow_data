      "content": "Using a seed when generating images creates consistency. While you won't get the same result every time, using a seed can help create more images that look similar to one you like, or it can help create consistency with characters. Seed numbers should only be used within the session they are created, as they aren't static and can lead to unintended results if used between sessions."

You can generate an image by using the /imagine command and then entering a text prompt.

From there, you can select a Midjourney plan by posting /subscribe in one of the newbies channels.
