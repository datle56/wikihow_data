      "title": "Take out the key and turn the steering wheel counterclockwise to lock it.",
      "content": "Take out the key and turn the steering wheel counterclockwise to lock it. It’s important that you cut off all power to any of the controls in your steering wheel before you take it off so you don’t risk shocking yourself. Turn off your vehicle and remove the key from the ignition so it’s not drawing any power from your battery. Then, turn your steering wheel counterclockwise, or to the left, until you hear it click so it’s locked into place. [1] X Research source Locking the steering wheel will make it easier to remove and find the right alignment so you can reinstall it correctly."

      "content": "Disconnect the battery and wait 10 minutes to deactivate the airbag. Removing all electricity from your vehicle will make sure your airbag won’t accidentally deploy when you try to remove it. Pop the hood and find your car’s battery. Use a wrench to loosen the screw and remove the cable from the negative terminal first, which will have a negative symbol (-) next to it. Then, remove the cable from the positive terminal, which will have a plus sign (+) next to it. Wait about 10 seconds for the power to drain from your airbag. [2] X Research source Oftentimes the negative terminal will have a black covering and the positive terminal will have a red covering that you need to lift in order to access the terminals. Don’t remove the screw holding the cables to the terminals. Just loosen them enough for you to slide them off."

      "title": "Pop off the trim pieces on the steering wheel with a screwdriver.",
      "content": "Pop off the trim pieces on the steering wheel with a screwdriver. The trim of your vehicle covers and protects the bolts that attach your steering wheel. Look for 2 small coverings in the trim on either the sides or the top and bottom of your steering wheel. Take a flathead screwdriver and wedge it into the crease of the trim pieces and pop them off to expose the bolts underneath. [3] X Research source The location of the trim pieces varies based on the make and model of your vehicle."

      "title": "Use a socket wrench to remove the bolts beneath the trim pieces.",
      "content": "Use a socket wrench to remove the bolts beneath the trim pieces. Attach a socket that fits the bolts to your wrench. Fit the socket over 1 of the bolts and start rotating it counterclockwise to unscrew it. Continue unscrewing the bolt until you can remove it by hand. Then, remove the other bolt the same way. [4] X Research source Some vehicles may have bolts that fit a star bit, which you can attach to your socket wrench to remove."

      "title": "Pull out the airbag and unclip the wiring harness to remove it.",
      "content": "Pull out the airbag and unclip the wiring harness to remove it. With the bolts removed, the airbag will be loose enough to be pulled out of the center of the steering wheel, but there are still wires connected to it, so don’t pull it all of the way out. Use your hands to gently pull the airbag from your steering wheel until you can see the wiring beneath it. Then, locate the harness on the back of the airbag and carefully disconnect them to remove the airbag. [5] X Research source Set the airbag aside so you can reinstall it later."

If your vehicle has cruise control or extra controls on your steering wheel, there will be additional wires on your steering wheel that need to be disconnected. Find the harnesses that the wires are connected to and gently pull them apart so they’re separated.

On the slot where you removed the center bolt, look for 2 markings where the steering wheel and shaft meet that are lined up to indicate the correct orientation of the steering wheel. If there aren’t 2 markings, take a marker and draw a small line over where the steering wheel and the shaft connect.

If your steering wheel has 2 slots on each side of the shaft, then you’ll need to use a puller to remove it. Fit the puller over the center of the steering wheel and insert both of the long puller screws into the 2 slots. Tighten them by hand so they’re firmly attached.

The easiest way to cut out a strip of leather that matches the dimensions of your steering wheel is to use the old leather itself. Take your new leather material and lay it on a flat surface so the underside is facing up. Cut your old leather at the seam and stretch it out straight. Place it on top of your new leather material and use a pencil to trace the outline onto the new material. [16] X Research source Look for quality leather material at auto body shops, craft supply stores, or by ordering it online."

Start at 1 edge and push the needle all the way through the ends of the leather, loop it over, then push it through again. Continue sewing along the ends and tie a knot at the end to secure the stitching. [20] X Research source Curved sewing needles work better for sewing leather.

Start at the edges that you’ve sewn together and push 1 needle through 1 side of the leather and push the other needle through the other side so they’re directly across from each other. Sew the material together by alternating the needles back and forth to form a baseball stitch over the surface of the steering wheel. Pull the thread tight each time you push the needle through the leather. [22] X Research source Take your time and insert the needles evenly along the edge of the leather to form a tight and strong stitching.
