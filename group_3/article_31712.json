      "content": "Use an emergency key or screwdriver to unlock a twist bathroom lock. Place an emergency key directly into the pinhole in the doorknob (many locks come with these keys in case of lock-outs). Slide the key around until you feel it slide into a notch inside the knob. Then, turn the key to unlock the door. [1] X Research source Check the ledge on the trim above the door for an emergency key. Many people store the keys there. If you don’t have the emergency key, use a screwdriver to unlock the door . Simply insert a small flathead screwdriver straight into the hole in the middle of the doorknob and twist it until you hear the door unlock. You don’t need to turn the doorknob while using the screwdriver. [2] X Research source Choose a small screwdriver like the ones that are used to repair eyeglasses, watches, or electronics. Screwdrivers with thicker rods won’t work as these will not fit inside the door handle."

      "content": "Bend a paper clip or flatten a wire coat hanger for a makeshift key. If you don’t have the emergency key or a small screwdriver, use a large paperclip to unlock the door. Unbend one end of the paper clip to make a longer, straight piece. Then, use needlenose pliers to bend the end into a U-shape about ½ an inch (12.7 mm) long. Place the bent end of the paperclip straight into the hole on the doorknob. Turn it gently until you feel it slip into the notch, then turn it more firmly to unlock the door. [3] X Research source Be sure that the width of the “U” is small enough to fit in the hole on the knob. Small paper clips are too thin and flimsy to turn the lock. Alternatively, straighten the top hook of a wire coathanger. Then, place the hanger on a hard surface like concrete and hit it with a hammer to flatten the end. Put the flattened end of the hanger inside the doorknob hole and turn to open the lock."

      "content": "Place a butter knife in the keyhole to open a push-button lock. If you are locked out of a bathroom in your home, use a butter knife to unlock the door. Place the butter knife into the keyhole in the same way you would use a key. Twist the knife to gently release the lock and then turn the doorknob to open the door. [4] X Research source Locksmith Ray Lawrence says if there's enough gap, you could shim the latch back with a butter knife much like you would with a credit card. However, he cautions against it. “I would probably advise anyone not to use a butter knife. Use a credit card instead.” [5] X Expert Source Ray Lawrence Locksmith Expert Interview. March 16 2023."

      "title": "Use a bobby pin to unlock a bathroom door with a push-button lock.",
      "content": "Use a bobby pin to unlock a bathroom door with a push-button lock. Place the rounded end of the bobby pin in the hole on or near the doorknob. Keep the bobby pin straight and push until the end meets the lock release button on the inside of the locking mechanism. Once you hear the click of the lock opening, turn the knob to open the door. [6] X Research source Bobby pins are often used to pick locks , even on doors with key locks. This is because they’re easy to find and manipulate into the right shape."

      "title": "Try using a credit card to unlock the door.",
      "content": "Try using a credit card to unlock the door. Slide the card between the door and the frame, just above the lock. Tilt the card towards the doorknob. Then, bend the card towards the doorknob to try and get it to slip in between the lock and the frame. Lean on the door and wiggle the card back and forth to unlock the door. [7] X Research source Use a card or other thin piece of plastic that you don't mind damaging. A loyalty card may be a good choice, as it is easier to replace than a credit card, gift card, or identification card. [8] X Research source Lawrence says it’s not possible to use a credit card on an internal door with a key lock. [9] X Expert Source Ray Lawrence Locksmith Expert Interview. March 16 2023."

      "title": "Remove the door handle if you can’t otherwise unlock the door.",
      "content": "Remove the door handle if you can’t otherwise unlock the door. If the door handle has exterior screws, use a drill or screwdriver to unscrew them. Once the screws are out, place the screwdriver into the lock mechanism of the door handle and twist it gently to undo the lock. [10] X Research source For door handles that don’t have exterior screws, place a flathead screwdriver under the slit in the throat of the doorknob. Then pull the screwdriver up to lift the exterior away to expose the screws underneath. Unscrew these screws using a screwdriver or drill. Only remove the knob after trying the other options. Not only does it take longer, but it can also damage your doorknob or door."

      "content": "Use a tool from a lock-picking set if you have one. A lock-picking set is invaluable if you frequently have trouble with the lock on your bathroom door. Because most interior doors have a simple locking mechanism, you most likely won’t need the full lock-picking set. Select a long, slim tool that fits into the hole on the doorknob. Then, place the tool inside and turn it to release the lock. You most likely won’t need a lock pick set to open the interior doors of your home. Lock-picking sets are most commonly used to pick key locks . The multiple tools allow you to manipulate the springs inside the lock to mimic the unique ridges on a key."

      "content": "Take a few deep breaths and remain calm. Although it can be frightening to suddenly be locked inside a bathroom, stay as calm as possible. Try to control your breathing and think about the situation rationally. [11] X Research source Being locked in a small space, like a bathroom, can cause some people to panic. However, this may cloud your thinking, which can make opening the locked door more difficult."

      "title": "Call to get the attention of others who may be nearby.",
      "content": "Call to get the attention of others who may be nearby. If you’re in a busy location, like an office or public restroom, calling for help is the easiest way to get out of the locked bathroom. Shout for attention, explaining that you’re locked in the bathroom. If people can’t hear you, use your hand or an object inside the bathroom, like a trash bin, to make enough noise to get someone’s attention. [12] X Research source It’s much easier to open a locked bathroom door from the outside than from the inside. This is because there are more people around outside who are able to help, like a homeowner in a private residence or a janitor or building manager in a public space. These people may have access to keys or tools that can be used to get the door unlocked."

      "title": "Use a thin, plastic card to slide between the door and the frame.",
      "content": "Use a thin, plastic card to slide between the door and the frame. As with opening a bathroom door from the outside, a credit card, identification card, or gift card can help you get a door open from the inside. Place the card just above the bolt and angle it slightly towards where the bolt retracts. Slowly turn the handle and pull the card downward sharply to open the door. [13] X Research source This may take a few attempts to get right. The aim is to disengage the lock by turning the handle while using the card to hold the bolt slightly away from the frame. This allows the lock to retract and for you to open the door. [14] X Research source Try to use a nonessential card, as this method of opening the door may damage it. A plastic card is one of the only ways to unlock a bathroom door from the inside. Butter knives, bobby pins, and screwdrivers can only be used from the outside."

      "content": "Check the bathroom for other ways to exit. If you aren’t able to get anyone’s attention and the lock isn’t coming open, look around the room to see if there’s a window large enough for you to climb out. While bathroom windows are often very small and don’t open very wide, some windows may be large enough for a person to fit through. Check outside the window to make sure it’s safe to climb out. [15] X Research source Only climb out a window if the bathroom is on the ground floor. If the bathroom is higher up, climbing out of a window could be dangerous. Don’t try to climb through the window if there are bars in the way or if you don’t have a good place to land."
