If it doesn't, you can also find the order on eBay by logging in and looking under your account. [1] X Research source eBay recommends that the seller use a drop-down menu to add a return policy, meaning the policy is usually listed on the item page. To find the item you bought, look under \"My eBay\" and \"Purchase History.\" You should be able to find the order, which will have a link to the original item."
