Wrap as many layers as players, with some to spare in case more players turn up. The parcel should be large enough for at least a 5 minute game, so add more layers even when you have only a few players; it just means they get more turns."

Add reasons such as: \"is wearing green\", \"has a pink ribbon\", \"likes penguins\", \"got an A in math this week\" etc. The labels should be more descriptive the better you know the children, and less descriptive for parties where you aren't very familiar with the children. Colors, hairstyles, types of clothing and shoes are always a safe bet. Read \"Tips\" for how to make this more fun for adults."

Wrap many extra layers over it, writing a silly activity for the player to perform on every layer outside the first one, up until the second last. An activity example: Jump on one foot while clapping your hands over your head and sing the alphabet backwards. That's a good one for older children and adults; don't make the activities too difficult for young children or they'll lose interest. Make enough layers and activities for at least two per person. A bag of candies, balloons, plastic toys, etc. makes a good shareable choice."
