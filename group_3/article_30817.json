You can also use an entire bar of soap, if you prefer. Any bar soap, whether whole or in pieces or scraps, will work. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Shred the soap using a cheese grater. A regular, four-sided standing metal cheese grater works perfectly, but a smaller hand-held cheese grater would also do the trick. The idea is to reduce larger pieces into smaller shreds that will be easier to melt. [2] X Research source A citrus zester or a potato peeler could also be used if you don’t have a cheese grater on hand."

      "title": "Heat the soap pieces in a pot with 8-9 cups of water.",
      "content": "Heat the soap pieces in a pot with 8-9 cups of water. In a large saucepan over low to medium heat, heat the soap pieces until melted. If you’re planning on making a creamy body wash instead of a liquid hand soap, use less water. The more water you use, the thinner the end product will be. [3] X Research source If you’re concerned about reusing your saucepan for cooking and possibly contaminating food with soap ingredients, you might want to designate an old pot just for melting soap, or pick up a cheap, used one at a thrift store."

      "content": "Remove the soap from the stove. Let it sit covered for 12-24 hours. The soap will thicken overnight. If the soap is not at the consistency you prefer, you can reheat it and make adjustments as necessary. [4] X Research source If you’re still not sure of the consistency, use a whisk or a blender to mix it together further."

      "title": "Cut your soap base into cubes and put them into a glass bowl.",
      "content": "Cut your soap base into cubes and put them into a glass bowl. Glassware is better than plasticware, as plastic may leech out any fragrance oil in your soap. If you’re planning on making bar soaps as your end project, weigh out the amount of soap in advance so that it matches the mold you’ll be using. If you’re unsure of how much your mold holds, fill it with water and then dump it into a measuring cup. It’s best to use ½ to 1 ounce more than what the mold holds. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Cover the glass bowl with plastic wrap and put it in the microwave. Covering the bowl helps to keep the moisture sealed inside. Heat your soap at 30 second intervals. It’s important not to overheat your soap base as it could ruin the integrity of the soap."

If you’re using goat milk soap, adding 1 tablespoon (14.8 ml) of water for every 2 cups of soap will help the soap scraps or pieces bind to each other. [9] X Research source"

The best thing to do is just stir the soap every couple of minutes or so. If the soap shreds or pieces are not melting into each other, add 1 additional tablespoon of water at a time, up to 3 teaspoons. [10] X Research source"
