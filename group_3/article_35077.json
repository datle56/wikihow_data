Let her say what’s on her mind before you talk. [1] X Research source She may want to express her feelings, which can range from shock to denial to joy, or a mixture of many emotions at once. [2] X Research source If your girlfriend tells you she’s pregnant, and doesn’t really say anything else, she might be looking for a sign that you care. Show her that you do and give her a chance to express herself by asking something neutral like “How do you feel about it?”"

      "content": "Let her know you care. [4] X Research source Assuming that you will try to be supportive of your girlfriend, you should react by showing that you care about her and the situation, and will support any decision she makes. Saying something reassuring like “This is really big news, but don’t worry—I’m going to be there for you and help you with whatever you need” can be meaningful. This is especially true in cultures where pregnancy can bring shame to the family and lead to the girl getting ostracized."

      "content": "Keep in contact with your girlfriend. If you want to be supportive of your girlfriend, then don’t run away or hide from her. Be there when she needs to talk, and make sure she can easily contact you when you’re apart. Keep in mind that she might need to talk more about the pregnancy later on, even after she first shares the news."

      "content": "Make sure she is pregnant. As soon as your girlfriend thinks she is pregnant, she should take steps to make sure. If she hasn’t already by the time she tells you, she can start by taking a pregnancy test, which she can get at a pharmacy or many other stores. If the pregnancy test shows “positive” or “pregnant,” your girlfriend should still see a doctor to make absolutely sure. A doctor can run tests to verify that she is pregnant, and give an ultrasound to make sure the pregnancy is viable. If your girlfriend is pregnant and she wants to have the baby (either to parent it or to offer it for adoption), it is important that she see a doctor, who can help her and the fetus (unborn baby) stay healthy and safe during pregnancy."

      "content": "Learn about your options. [5] X Research source Your girlfriend may have several options for handling a pregnancy. Before making a decision about what to do, make sure that she has good information about them. Your girlfriend may want to have the baby and parent it. This may or may not mean marriage or a long-term relationship. The two of you should discuss your long-term relationship plans in addition to the pregnancy. Your girlfriend may want to have the baby and offer it for adoption. Your girlfriend may also decide to terminate the pregnancy (have an abortion). Laws regulating when and how a woman may elect an abortion vary by state. [6] X Research source In some states, for example, a minor can make an abortion decision on her own, while parental consent must be provided in other states. Emergency contraception (“the morning after pill”) will not work if your girlfriend is already pregnant.

      "title": "Talk about it.",
      "content": "Talk about it. Maybe your girlfriend knows exactly what she wants to do about the pregnancy. On the other hand, she might be confused, unsure, or just not ready to make a decision. If she’s not sure, the two of you can start talking about your options and how to handle things. Common options for handling a pregnancy including having the baby and parenting it (as a single parent or a couple), offering it for adoption, or terminating it (having an abortion). Each of these options brings unique concerns, so your girlfriend shouldn’t rush to make a decision without getting information and thinking things through. The decision is ultimately up to your girlfriend, so you should support her without being demanding. Don’t push your girlfriend one way or another. Avoid making statements like “You need to…” or “You have to…” If your girlfriend is considering multiple options, let her know you care by saying something like “I’ll support you whatever your decision is.” If your girlfriend asks what you want to do, be honest. If the two of you don’t agree, tell her something like “I know this is a really hard decision to make. I wanted to be honest with you, but I’m willing to talk about it and change my mind if we think another option is better.” You can also offer to support her decision even if it is different from what you would have chosen."

It can be very stressful to tell others about the pregnancy, especially if you are young, and your girlfriend will probably appreciate the support. Make a plan to tell her parents and/or your own before you meet. [9] X Research source Tell the parents something direct like: “I (or we) have some big news to tell you. [Name] is pregnant.” Give parents time to speak and react, and be prepared for them to have a range of responses. Parents might be angry, happy, shocked, upset, hurt, disappointed, concerned, excited, or feel a combination of emotions. Remember that parents’ feelings can change over time, just like your own. Most parents want to be supportive, even if they are upset at first."

[11] X Research source Becoming a parent, or the possibility of becoming a parent, involves a wide range of personal, emotional, physical, medical, and legal concerns. Even an option that seems like an obvious choice will come along with its own issues and things to deal with. If your girlfriend wants to have and keep the baby, help her decide how to plan for it, considering finances, education, work, living situations, etc. If your girlfriend wants to have the baby and offer it for adoption, help her through the adoption process and the decisions that must be made (for instance, whether or not the biological mother and father will be revealed to the child, whether or not there will be contact between the biological and adoptive parents, etc.). If your girlfriend wants to have an abortion, make sure she understands the medical and emotional risks of the procedure, and that she will be cared for afterwards.

If you and your girlfriend don’t agree on what to do, you will have to realize that in almost all cases the decision about a pregnancy is ultimately up to the woman. You can try to compromise, or work with a counselor or lawyer to find a way to agree or understand each other. If your girlfriend wants to have to the baby and the two of you do not marry, you may be required to pay child support. The two of you will also have to work out arrangements regarding custody, visitation, etc. If your girlfriend wants to have the baby and offer it for adoption, and you do not, you may or may not be able to get custody of the child (laws vary by state). If your girlfriend chooses to have an abortion, it is her decision (though she may need parental consent if she is a minor, in some states). If you oppose, however, you may be able to work with a counselor to reach an agreement."

You can support your girlfriend afterwards by helping her with daily tasks and providing comfort. Expect there to be some bleeding, cramps, and discomfort afterwards. If there are unusual or unexpected symptoms, such as heavy or continuous bleeding, fever, or extreme pain, help your girlfriend get medical assistance right away. Help your girlfriend follow any advice from the doctor, such as getting and taking medications, resting, etc. It is normal to have a range of feelings afterwards, or even to have mixed feelings. However, if you think your girlfriend is suffering in some way (depression, stress, etc.), help her consult a counselor."

The combination of physical changes, stress about things that have to be taken care of, and just the general newness of it all can mean changes for your relationship with your girlfriend. Attending some prenatal counseling sessions can help the two of you prepare for the changing roles and expectations. Things to expect include: Changing roles at home (taking on more chores, for instance). Alterations to sleep schedules. Less attention to each other as you work to meet the needs of pregnancy and a new baby. Different sexual habits, desires, and needs."
