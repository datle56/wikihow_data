      "title": "Show them your empathetic side.",
      "content": "Show them your empathetic side. “Pisces is a very compassionate sign. It’s a very sensitive sign,” explains Eyedealism. Because of this, they’re usually looking for a partner who shares their caring, kindhearted energy. If you really want to catch a Pisces’s attention, show them you're a compassionate person through your actions. For example, things like volunteering for charities, animal shelters, or environmental clean-ups can really impress a Pisces. You can even invite them to join you! It’s also important to show compassion to a Pisces on a personal level. If they’re going through something, take the time to talk them through it and emotionally support them. This will likely make them feel more connected to you."

      "title": "Talk about your dreams and fantasies with them.",
      "content": "Talk about your dreams and fantasies with them. Ruled by Neptune, the planet of imagination and illusion, Pisces are known for being idealistic dreamers. [1] X Research source They’d much rather talk about big, fantastical goals than mundane, day-to-day things. If you want to attract a Pisces, strike up a convo about your most out-of-the-box ambitions and aspirations, and ask about theirs, too. They’ll likely jump at the chance to dream with you!"

      "title": "Explore spiritual topics with them.",
      "content": "Explore spiritual topics with them. Pisces tend to be very interested in the spiritual, mystical, and otherworldly, and they’re most compatible with people who share these interests. If you’re talking to your Pisces crush, try asking them about their spirituality or philosophical interests, and share a bit about your own beliefs. Water sign Pisces isn’t a shallow pool, they’re a deep ocean, so they won’t shy away from these meaningful conversations—in fact, they’ll totally love them! [2] X Research source Just remember to be respectful and open-minded . As mutable signs, Pisces tend to be flexible, accepting people, and they’re looking for partners who match this energy, Eyedealism explains. In other words, it won’t go over well if you’re super rigid in your beliefs and not accepting of theirs. Pisces can easily get turned off by intolerance or black-and-white thinking. Instead, maintain an open-minded curiosity about their spiritual ideas. Pisces are incredibly deep and intuitive people, so you might gain some fascinating new insights from them!"

      "title": "Connect with them over music and other art forms.",
      "content": "Connect with them over music and other art forms. “Music is a huge thing with Pisces, music and art and colors,” says Eyedealism. “So, for example, if a Pisces suggests that they really love a certain song, or that they would like to find out what your musical interests are, that would be a great way to create intimacy with them,” she explains. If you’re trying to start a conversation with them, for example, try asking what songs or albums they’ve been into lately. Or, if you’ve already been talking and flirting for a bit, you could even offer to make them a personalized playlist of songs you think they’d love. This will totally make a Pisces swoon! If you don’t share the same taste in music, try connecting with them over other art forms. Share a book recommendation with them, or get a fun convo going by asking a question like, “What do you think is the best movie of all time?”"

      "title": "Express yourself through your clothes and personal style.",
      "content": "Express yourself through your clothes and personal style. Pisces are a very artistic sign, and they deeply value aesthetics. [3] X Research source Because of this, they’ll definitely appreciate it if you show off your personality and style through your clothing choices. Luckily, Pisces are also very accepting, so there’s no one type of style they prefer best. If you dress in clothes that make you feel confident and comfortable, you can’t go wrong! As a water sign, a Pisces may be drawn to blues, violets, and greens, so if you have any clothing pieces in these colors, it could be a good idea to wear them around your Pisces crush. [4] X Research source If your clothes have a story attached to them (the skirt you're wearing belonged to your mother and she wore it to Woodstock, or your watch was a gift from your grandfather) it’ll also make for good conversation. Sentimental Pisceans love these kinds of things!"

      "title": "Find out what your Pisces really likes.",
      "content": "Find out what your Pisces really likes. Try not to assume your Pisces’s preferences when it comes to dates. Instead, really take the time to get to know them through conversation and find out the things they enjoy. A Pisces will really appreciate it if you plan a super personalized and unique date for them—it shows that you really know them, and that kind of sensitivity and care is kryptonite for a Pisces! [5] X Research source Just try not to be too direct or obvious when you’re trying to gain intel. Eyedealism explains that Pisces prefers a bit of mystery and magic in the wooing process. “They do not like direct action at all,” she says. For example, instead of saying something like, “I want to take you on a date. What kind of things do you like to do?” try something vague, like “I saw a flyer for a paint-and-sip event that looked cool. Are you into that sort of thing?” Then, once you’ve sneakily confirmed that they would enjoy this type of date, you can surprise them with tickets to the event."

      "title": "Invite them to a concert.",
      "content": "Invite them to a concert. As Eyedealism explains, a typical Pisces will likely be very into music. So, if you’ve tried to gather some intel and you’re still not sure what kind of date they’d like, a live music event could be a great place to start! For example, if they’re a major fan of a certain band or artist, do some research and see if they’ll be performing any shows in your area soon. Or, if you can’t find any major concerts to take them to, look for some local bars or restaurants that feature live music on certain nights. Both of these are great options because you may also get a chance to dance together, which can increase your connection both physically and emotionally. If live music isn't your thing, try inviting your Pisces over to listen to music. Extra points if you have a record player—you can put on an album they love and share a meal together!"

      "content": "Explore a museum, or do an artsy activity together. “Pisces are interested in art and culture,” so at times, their taste is “going to be a little bit more highbrow,” explains Eyedealism. This means that many Pisceans would jump at the chance to visit cool museums or attend interesting art exhibitions with you. If you're not really into art, you don't have to force it, but this may be an opportunity for you to broaden your interests a little! Other artsy dates that would interest a classic Pisces might include tickets to the ballet, going to see an arthouse film, or attending a poetry reading or gallery opening."

      "title": "Plan something that’s both romantic and outside-the-box.",
      "content": "Plan something that’s both romantic and outside-the-box. According to Eyedealism, “Putting imagination or creativity into the wooing process is what will engage [a Pisces].” In other words, a Pisces may not be all that impressed by a cookie-cutter date, like going to see a movie together. They’d be much more captivated by something unique and atypical, but still super romantic. For example, if your Pisces crush is into ceramics, plan on taking a pottery class together. Then, after the class, take your Pisces to a rooftop picnic you've planned, complete with candles, blankets, wine, and delicious foods. This type of date combines their artistic interests with swoon-worthy romance, which is totally perfect for a Pisces!"

      "title": "Look for clues about what makes them feel good.",
      "content": "Look for clues about what makes them feel good. While spending time with the Pisces, watch for clues about what seems to make them feel cared for, valued, appreciated, and attractive. Did they light up when you complimented their sense of humor? Or when you held their hand, or said they looked amazing? According to Eyedealism, Pisceans are “all about vibes and instincts and feelings,” so if you take the time to pay attention to their cues and show you’re intuitively tapped into their emotions, this will go a long way. For example, if you notice that your Pisces date always seems super happy when you put your arm around them or hold their hand, continue making an effort to show them physical affection. Or, if you notice that your Pisces is always in an awesome mood after you compliment their appearance, make sure to mention how beautiful, handsome, or attractive they look when you go out on a date. In other words, try to show love and affection in the specific way that your Pisces prefers to receive it. This will show them that you’re truly paying attention to who they are as a person, which is important when wooing a sensitive, sentimental Pisces!"

      "content": "Shower them with romantic gestures. “Pisces are big romantics [...] they love flowers, they love candlelight,” says Eyedealism. So, if the two of you have gone on a few dates and you’re really trying to take things to the next level, some fairytale-like romantic gestures could be exactly what your connection needs. Think wine, chocolates, poetry, handwritten love letters—as long as you’re being romantic and sincere, a Pisces will totally be swept off their feet! For example, if you know they’ve been having a hard week at work or school, leave a bouquet of their favorite flowers on their doorstep, so they have something beautiful to cheer them up when they get home. Or, if they’re not that into flowers, surprise them with takeout from their favorite restaurant, along with decadent dessert and nice wine. If you aren’t really the artistic or expressive type, try texting them a famous poem, along with a message like, “This is exactly how I feel about you.” This is a great way to do something romantic, even if you’re having a hard time coming up with the words on your own!"

      "title": "Connect with them on a deep, emotional level.",
      "content": "Connect with them on a deep, emotional level. “If a Pisces is interested in you, they’ll really want to merge with you,” explains Eyedealism. In other words, they aren’t satisfied with a surface-level, casual relationship. Instead, they’ll want to really connect with you in an intense, intimate way. They aren’t just looking for a fling—they’re looking for their soulmate or their other half. To reach this type of deep connection, try to be emotionally open with your Pisces. Share your thoughts and feelings with them, both about your relationship and about the world at large. Ask them about their deepest thoughts and emotions, and show genuine interest the way they see the world, too. These types of deep, soul-baring conversations are exactly the kind of things that would make a Pisces fall deep in love with someone! Reader Poll: We asked 706 wikiHow readers what their biggest dealbreaker is as a Pisces and 62% of them said someone who lies. [Take Poll] Being open and honest about your feelings is a great way to connect with a Pisces."

      "title": "Talk about your romantic fantasies when you’re getting physical.",
      "content": "Talk about your romantic fantasies when you’re getting physical. When it comes to sexual relationships with a Pisces, they’re looking for someone who “puts some imagination into lovemaking,” says Eyedealism. This is no surprise, considering their ruling planet Neptune rules over imagination, illusion, and dreams! To really lean into this energy, ask your Pisces about their fantasies in the bedroom, and share a few of yours. For example, an imaginative, dreamy Pisces may be interested in out-of-the-box things, like roleplaying. A Pisces may also be very into foreplay, since this gives them the chance to use their imagination and build up excitement. Don’t make assumptions about what your Pisces crush would like, though. As with all sexual things, it’s essential to talk with your partner about what you’re each comfortable with, so you both feel safe and enjoy yourselves."
