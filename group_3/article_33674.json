      "content": "Find out the finish of your floor. Polyurethaned floors have a hard finish. You can clean them with a small amount of water. On the other hand, shellac or lacquered floors can’t have any water on them and may need to be waxed regularly. [2] X Research source If your floor has been shellacked or lacquered, you’ll have to strip and wax it yearly. You can use denatured alcohol and lacquer thinner to test your floor finish. Test a small area of the floor you normally cover with furniture or a rug. Apply 2-3 drops of the alcohol. After a few seconds, touch the spot with an old cloth. If it feels soft, it’s shellac. If the alcohol doesn’t soften the finish, apply 2-3 drops of lacquer thinner to a nearby spot. If it softens to the touch, the finish is lacquer. If it feels tacky, it’s likely water-based.

[4] X Research source Use smooth strokes. Start at the interior corner and work outward toward a doorway. This motion will keep you from stepping on your wet floors. Wipe up excess liquid if you see standing water. It can cause damage and buckling in your floors. Use a clean dry rag or towel. Make sure the surface is completely dry. Never mop floors that have been waxed. Clean them by vacuuming and sweeping. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Buff the floor. Get on your hands and knees to buff with a microfiber cloth. If you prefer to stand, use a dry microfiber mop. Move in a circular motion until it shines. You could also rent a buffing machine if you prefer. Move the machine in the direction of the wood grain. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Buy the right polish.",
      "content": "Buy the right polish. Use water-based (urethane) polish on floors with a polyurethane finish. For other finishes, use a wax-based polish. Squirt the solution onto the floor and wipe the floors with a microfiber cloth. You can do this by hand or attach the cloth to your mop.”"

      "title": "Test an area of your floor.",
      "content": "Test an area of your floor. Even if you know what kind of finish your floor has, you should test the polish to make sure it won’t discolor the wood. Locate an area under a large piece of furniture or in a closet. Apply the polish. Wipe it with a microfiber cloth. If no damage appears, you can polish the entire floor. If you see discoloration, seek advice from a professional contractor."

      "title": "Apply the polish.",
      "content": "Apply the polish. Depending on the directions, either spray the polish directly to the floor or apply it to a cloth first. [7] X Research source Use a “feathering” technique (wiping the polish in a semi-circle). Overlap your feathering strokes for a streak-free finish."

Continue along the length of the room to the third corner. Polish to the last corner. Begin to move inward to polish the center of the room. Polish the area by the doorway last to avoid ruining your hard work. If your floor has been waxed, apply 2-3 thin layers of polish instead of one thick layer. Wait for each coat to dry completely (about 24 hours) before applying the next one. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Allow the polish to dry completely. Your floor will feel tacky or sticky until it’s completely dry. For good measure, wait six to 24 hours before walking on the floor with socks. Don’t wear shoes for at least 24 hours. You can replace your furniture after 2 days. Block off the area with painter’s tape or a chair for at least 6 hours. If you have companion animals, keep them away from the polished area for at least 24 hours. You could also fit them with “doggie socks” after 6 hours."
