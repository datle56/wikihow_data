Writing a palanca letter is a religious practice of sending blessings to a loved one. These letters often include prayers, sacrifices, or actions you’re making to God on their behalf. [3] X Research source These letters are often sent for Confirmation retreats or for Cursillo weekend. This is a three-day series of talks to call upon the Holy Spirit for enlightenment and guidance. [4] X Research source Letters can also come from strangers. For incarcerated men, there is a three-day retreat called Residents Encounter Christ. It is in support of those who are working to build a personal relationship with God. [5] X Research source"

Instead of opening the letter with the recipient’s full name, address them by “Dear Child of God,” “Dear Brother In Christ,” or “Dear Sister In Christ.” [6] X Research source This helps reinforce the idea of social belonging.

      "content": "Explain why this person matters to you. Your letter’s introduction should address your relationship to the person you’re writing to—a sister, brother, friend. Reflect back on shared memories. What was a time you can recall a good action they did? How have they brought love and joy into your life? This is your opportunity to show your appreciation for who they are. If you are writing to a stranger, open with your palanca and how long you’ve been practicing it. For example, “For the last two weeks, I have been fasting on your behalf in hopes you’ll grow closer to God.” [8] X Research source"

For example, if you’re writing to a younger sibling who has been struggling with balancing their religious studies with school work. Take the time to celebrate their dedication and recognize that may not have been an easy task. [9] X Research source"

While the letter doesn’t have to be written for your offering to be effective, the letter contributes to a hopefully long-lasting bond between you and the recipient. [10] X Research source It is something they can look back should they need a positive boost. Your offerings show them your commitment and belief in their journey and success. For an example of acts of service, “I have been volunteering to work in the food pantry every Saturday for the last three weeks in support of your journey.”"

While you are welcome to share your palanca in advance, don’t tell your recipient about the letter itself. After spending three days on a retreat, the letter serves as a way to summarize a wonderful, moving experience. [12] X Research source Sharing your offering in advance can look as simple as letting the person you’re writing to know, “I’ve been praying for you,” or “I’ve been practicing small good deeds every day on your behalf.” You’re welcome to go more in-depth in the letter about your experience."

      "content": "Dear Brother in Christ, It feels just like yesterday when I held you in my arms for the first time, and sometimes, it’s hard to believe that fourteen years have passed since then. I am so proud to see how you’ve grown into such a wonderful young man. Always so considerate. I think a lot about how quickly you’re able to take care of Mom when I can’t. I’ll admit sometimes I feel guilty about not being able to step up to the plate, but you’re always so genuinely happy to help. As your Confirmation day grows closer, I find myself praying for you every night. After you and Mom go to bed, I make a small cup of tea and sit out on the porch and pray for your continued perseverance and safety. You work so hard, and I am eager for a day where you can take a step back and relax. I know that God will guide you in that direction with time. I simply pray you’re able to continue on until then. When I find myself struggling, I look back at this picture I have of the two of us. We both have the biggest smiles. It was taken just after we climbed a big rock that was three times our size. I still remember how nervous Mom was. But you were so determined to make it to the top, and we did. It was the first time we saw the mountain range and I remember how close I felt to God and to you in that moment. I hope you know that no matter what happens in life, I will be just one step behind you, ready to catch you if you fall. The same way that God continues to carry us. I hope you’re able to feel His presence on your retreat and remember how much love and support surrounds you every day—because you deserve every ounce of it. Love always, Your sister"

You are answering a calling and by doing so, God will bless you and bring you closer to Him. For the last few weeks, I have been volunteering at a food drive. With every belly filled, I think and pray for you. I pray that you are able to find forgiveness in your life, and forgiveness for others. I pray that you will continue on in your journey and only grow closer to God instead of further from Him. His love is powerful. I have no doubt that with time and prayer, you will be able to fully experience his love, too. I hope you are reading your bible often. If you can’t, I will read a scripture before bed every night on your behalf. God bless you, Janie"
