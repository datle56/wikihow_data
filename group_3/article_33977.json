      "content": "Get up at the same time every morning. Even though you've done most of your prep work the night before, you still don't want to be rushing around in the morning. Leave yourself plenty of time to get cleaned up, get dressed, and get your things together before you have to leave. [1] X Research source For example, if you have to catch your bus at 7:30, you might want to wake up at 6:30. This gives you an hour to get dressed, eat breakfast, wash your face, brush your teeth, and make sure you have everything you'll need for school. You might find that you don't need as much time in the morning, but be careful not to cut it too close. Ideally, you'll have time to do everything you need to do and still be calm, friendly, and social with your family before heading out. Since you went to sleep at the appropriate hour, you should feel well-rested in the morning. If you feel tired, bump your bedtime up a half-hour and see if that helps. You might have to play around with it a little until you find the right time.

Scrambled eggs only take a few minutes to make—add spinach to get your vegetable in. If you don't have time in the morning, make them in advance. Put your eggs between 2 slices of bread, an English muffin, or a bagel, then wrap it up and put it in the fridge. All you have to do is heat it in the microwave for about 10 seconds and it'll be good to go. Stay away from sugary cereals and toaster pastries—the sugar will cause you to crash later and won't give you the focused energy you need. If your school serves breakfast, it's fine to wait until you get there to eat something. Just make sure you're starting your day with something healthy that will give you the energy you need."

Since you took a bath or shower last night, this should be all you need to do to look your best in the morning—and it probably won't take you more than 10 or 15 minutes. Start by putting on the clothes that you laid out last night. If you have longer hair, you might want to pull it back so it's out of your way at school or more manageable during activities.

You can always put it in the fridge for the next day to keep anything from spoiling. [5] X Research source If you're eating lunch at school, you might want to look at the lunch menu schedule so you know what your options are for the next day. If you have a choice, figure out what you want the night before so you won't have to make a decision on the spot tomorrow."

If you'll need a change of clothes for PE or another activity, make sure they're clean and ready to go along with your other school things. You might want to check the weather as well.

This will get your mind and body to slow down and get ready for sleep more naturally. This works best if everybody else in your family is also engaged in relatively quiet activities so they don't disturb or distract you. [11] X Research source If the sun is still out when you're transitioning toward bedtime, close the blinds or curtains so the natural light won't come into your room. Avoid stimulating activities, such as exercise or watching an exciting television show, right before bed. When you stimulate your mind, you'll have a harder time falling asleep and won't sleep as deeply when you finally do. [12] X Research source"

Studies show that grade-school-age children need between 9 and 11 hours of sleep each night, while teenagers need 8 to 10 hours. Count backward from the time you need to wake up for school every morning to establish your bedtime. [13] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source For example, if you're 16 years old and you need to get up at 6 a.m., that means you need to go to bed sometime between 8 p.m. and 10 p.m. If 8 p.m. sounds way too early for you to go to bed, start with a 10 p.m. bedtime. You can always adjust it if you consistently feel tired in the morning."

One weekend or another day you don't have school, go through the motions as though you are getting ready for school—check the time when you're done and you'll know how much time you need each morning. [14] X Research source For example, you might find that it takes you 30 minutes to do everything you need to do in the morning at a normal pace. Add 15 minutes to this time (just in case anything goes wrong) and set your alarm for 45 minutes before you need to leave. Don't forget to add in time to wake up as well. If it usually takes a couple of minutes for the alarm to wake you up, set it a couple of minutes earlier than you need to get up to account for that."
