It has the same silly energy as walking into a room and yelling “Surprise!” at a surprise party or other celebration.

Use it to talk about gifts you want to give or receive specifically, or combine it with other festive emojis to describe the celebration in general. You can even include it in party invitations for a celebratory vibe (just make sure to clarify whether gifts are requested or not, since some people might think they are if they see a 🎁 symbol on the invite). “Can’t wait to celebrate with you on your birthday tomorrow! 🎁🎈🎂🍾” “I can’t wait to see what he got me for our anniversary. He always outdoes himself! 🎁”"

      "content": "Use it to symbolize generosity, giving, or gratitude. On a more abstract level, the 🎁 emoji represents sharing or receiving blessings and goodwill. Use it in casual, personal messages to express gratitude for gifts (literal or metaphorical) you’ve been given. Or, include it in a call to action to inspire others to make a donation or support a noble cause (in your personal or professional messages). “I loved catching up with you this weekend! Seeing you is always a blessing 🎁” “With a small donation of $5, you can sponsor a home cooked meal for one of our clients in need 🎁🥘”"

      "content": "Someone may be looking to exchange gifts or money for a date, hookup, or relationship. Listing a 🎁 emoji in your profile could mean you’re “gen” (generous) on dating and hookup apps like Grindr or Tinder (or that you’re looking for someone who is). Being or looking for someone “gen” could encompass a variety of things, from seeking a sugar baby-sugar daddy/momma relationship (where an older partner treats someone younger to gifts, money, or free dates) to more explicit solicitation (i.e. exchanging money or gifts for sexual acts). Most dating apps prohibit such solicitation and the exchanging of money or services in general. Grindr even includes the 🎁 emoji in its list of emojis that allude to buying or selling goods or services. [3] X Research source"

[5] X Research source The Unicode system assigns a unique numeric code to images and symbols (like emojis and letters) so that they appear the same way on different devices and in different languages. [6] X Research source However, early and non-standardized variations of the 🎁 emoji had been around for years (possibly since the late ‘80s or early 90’s in Japan, where emojis originated) before it was adopted by Unicode. The 🎁 emoji was recognized in Unicode’s first batch of documented emojis (Emojis 1.0) in 2015. [7] X Research source"
