If your sections are larger than the diameter of your rollers, then your curls will look limp. For short hair that's at least 2 inches (5.1 cm) long, you can try using very small rollers. If your hair is too short for rollers, follow the same rolling instructions using a 1-inch barrel curling iron, instead."

Begin with the bottom layer and smooth the straightener from about .5 inches (1.3 cm) away from your scalp steadily down your hair shaft. [6] X Research source When the bottom layer is finished, continue separating small sections of hair in the middle layer. Smooth hair with the flat iron from a .5 inches (1.3 cm) away from your scalp down the hair shaft. Lift hair from your scalp when straightening the top layer. After separating small sections of your top layer of hair, place the flat iron as close to your roots as possible. Press the iron firmly closed and draw it down the hair shaft outward from your head. For pin-straight, divide each layer into small sections. Glide the straightener only a few times over each section before moving along. [7] X Research source If your prefer smoother hair, divide it into larger sections. Then clamp the flat iron tightly and run it over each part slowly, ensuring the heat penetrates each section but with less direct contact."
