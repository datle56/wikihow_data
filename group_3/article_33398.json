The development cards come in 3 colors (green, yellow, and blue), and they’ll be the main deck you’re pulling from. You can separate the Noble Tiles and the gem tokens and put them in their own piles. [1] X Research source The aim of the game is to get as many Prestige points as possible. You get Prestige points by purchasing development cards with your gem tokens. Whoever has the most Prestige points at the end of the game wins!"

Green has 1 dot, yellow has 2 dots, and blue has 3 dots."

However, if there are less than 4 gems in the stack, you can’t do this action. [10] X Research source This action gets you less tokens than taking 3 different ones, so it’s a little bit of a desperate move.
