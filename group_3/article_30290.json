      "content": "Use origami paper or make a square. Origami paper already comes in the shape of a square, but you can make your own square with regular paper. To create a square, take a piece of paper and fold the top corner over to the opposite side of the paper, until the top edge of the paper is in line with the side of the paper. This will create a triangle. Then, cut around the triangle shape and open it up. You should have a square. make a square from normal letter-sized paper It's easiest if you start by taking the shortest side of the paper, then fold it down so it lines up along the longest edge. Then, cut off the excess paper to make a perfect square. [1] X Expert Source Lois Wade wikiHow Crafts Expert Expert Interview. 30 July 2020. You can use any color for this project—choose a color that you want for your dog."

      "content": "Fold your paper to create a triangle. If your paper doesn't already have a crease down the diagonal, you'll need to create one. Take the top, left corner and meet it with the bottom, right corner, lining up both sides of the triangle. Then, create a crease along the diagonal of the triangle. Unfold your paper back into the square and repeat on the opposite side. Once you unfold your paper back into the square you should have 2 diagonals across your square, intersecting in the middle. To get nice, sharp creases, run the back of a kitchen spoon across each fold as you make it. [2] X Expert Source Lois Wade wikiHow Crafts Expert Expert Interview. 30 July 2020."

After you have created the first fold, turn your diamond to the left, so that you have another bottom point, and fold that point into the middle crease. Then, turn it to the left again and fold that point inwards. Once you get to the last point, don't fold it. Flip your shape over. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Fold the sides of your shape inwards. Once you have flipped your shape over, position it so that the square of the shape is on the left and the triangle with the highest point is pointing towards the right. Then, fold the bottom half of your square over until it reaches the middle crease in your shape. Repeat on the other side, making sure you don't fold the flaps that pop up. Basically, once you are done folding, your shape should be very long horizontally, and you should have a diamond shape at the left side of your shape, with a much smaller diamond shape at the right side. If you folded your flaps on this fold, your diamond shape would not be complete. As you fold the sides of your square over, they should each have a triangle attached to them (on the top fold the triangle points upwards and on the bottom fold the triangle points downwards). Allow these triangles to flap up with the fold. Don't crease them into the fold."

Now, above your largest diamond, you should see 2 little triangles, 1 on the right and 1 on the left. These triangles are right triangles, with their 90° angle as the top corners of the shape. Open up the top right triangle until its top left point meets the edge of your shape. [5] X Research source Fold along the crease once you have opened up your triangle. Essentially, as you fold your triangle over to create a new shape, the top side of your triangle that was in line with the top edge of your bigger shape, will line up with the left and right side of your shape. Once it has lined up, you can create a crease. Remember to press your creases down well. A clean, sharp crease will give your folds more strength.

The top right side of your triangle should line up with the left side of your shape. Create the crease in your folds once everything is lined up. When you look at your shape once you have made your folds, you should see a straight top edge, with 2 small points sticking out of the sides. Then, underneath those 2 points you should see your larger diamond with 2 larger points sticking out to the sides. Then, underneath that you should see 2 triangles, with their bases along the sides of your shape. Finally, underneath those you should see a smaller diamond. If you don't have this shape quite right, you might consider going back a few steps and redoing your folds."

Once you have done this step, you'll still have somewhat of a large diamond shape, but the top point is inverted into a V instead of a point. Then, above the diamond shape, you should see 2 small squares, 1 on the right and 1 on the left."

[8] X Research source After you have done this, you should still have your long rectangle with the bottom triangle pointing downwards (almost like a pencil).

As you fold it over, you want the 2 sides of your wing, or your triangle to line up. If you looked at just that part of your shape it would create a rectangle."

Flip your shape over and repeat on the opposite side. Essentially, take the bottom right corner of your triangle and bring it towards the top point of your shape.
