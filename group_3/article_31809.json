      "content": "Use órale when making casual conversation with close friends. A lot of Mexican Spanish speakers say órale but only in informal settings, like at home or when they run into someone they know while running errands. The friends and family you say órale to will likely be the people you feel the most comfortable around and who are okay with you saying a Mexican slang term in their presence. [9] X Research source Avoid órale in professional settings or around older adults. When you're in a board meeting, talking to teachers and other professionals, and addressing your elders, stick to formal language. While órale doesn't have an offensive meaning, it's still a slang term, and that kind of casual terminology can be inappropriate in the above contexts."

      "content": "Órale originates from the Spanish word ahora meaning \"now.\" Over time, Spanish speakers dropped the \"a\" and \"h\" from the beginning of ahora, leaving it as ora . Then, Mexicans added \"le\" to the end of ora , which turned the word into an imperative – órale – a verb one uses to command or direct someone else. [10] X Research source Today, órale is used for a variety of different contexts, not just as an imperative."
