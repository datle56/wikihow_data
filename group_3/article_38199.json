      "content": "Say \"wǒ ài nǐ\" (我爱(愛)你) to literally say \"I love you\" to someone. The phrase \"wǒ ài nǐ\" (我爱(愛)你) is the most literal way to say \"I love you\" in Chinese. This is considered an expression of extremely strong emotion and is never used casually. [1] X Research source Use this phrase to express a lifelong love for someone in a more formal situation or serious occasion. For example, you might say this to your new spouse at your wedding, or on an anniversary. The phrase \"wǒ ài nǐ\" (我爱(愛)你) is not just romantic. It can also be used to express love between family members. However, as with romantic partners, it wouldn't be used off-handedly in a casual setting."

      "content": "Go with \"wǒ xǐ huān nǐ\" (我喜欢(歡)你) to express romantic feelings. A Chinese person would probably look at you strangely if you said \"wǒ ài nǐ\" (我爱(愛)你) to them — especially someone you just started dating or have a crush on. A literal translation of the phrase \"wǒ xǐ huān nǐ\" (我喜欢(歡)你) would be \"I like you,\" but it is actually the most common way to say \"I love you\" in Mandarin Chinese . [2] X Research source This phrase is also used in more casual situations where \"wǒ ài nǐ\" (我爱(愛)你) would be considered out of place. For example, you might say it to your romantic partner before the two of you go your separate ways."

      "title": "Use numbers to say \"I love you\" in a text message.",
      "content": "Use numbers to say \"I love you\" in a text message. Texting is very popular in China and a text short-hand has emerged to express your feelings for someone using numbers rather than the words themselves (either in Chinese or in English). The numbers are used in place of Chinese characters because the word for the number in Chinese is pronounced roughly the same as the character itself. Some romantic Chinese text message abbreviations include: [3] X Research source 520 (wǔ èr líng) stands for \"wǒ ài nǐ\" (I love you) 770 (qī qī líng) stands for \"qīn qīn nǐ\" (kiss you) 880 (bā bā líng) stands for \"bào bào nǐ\" (hug you) 530 (wǔ sān líng) stands for \"wǒ xiǎng nǐ\" (miss you). This phrase can also be interpreted to mean that you're thinking about the person."

      "title": "Try simply saying \"I love you\" in English.",
      "content": "Try simply saying \"I love you\" in English. While it's not Chinese, many Chinese speakers will switch to English when they want to tell someone they love them. Primarily, they do this because the phrase \"wǒ ài nǐ\" (我爱(愛)你) is considered far too strong or too serious. If you're just saying \"I love you\" in a casual moment, such as when getting off the phone, it would probably be more appropriate to say it in English than to say it in Chinese."

      "content": "Say \"wǒ xiǎng nǐ\" to let a romantic interest know you're thinking about them. The phrase \"wǒ xiǎng nǐ\" (我想你) can mean either \"I miss you\" or \"I'm thinking of you.\" Either is considered an expression of affection. The person's understanding of the phrase really depends on the context in which you say it. [4] X Research source For example, if you texted the phrase to someone you hadn't seen in a while, it might more commonly be interpreted to mean that you missed them, although either understanding would be appropriate. If you've only met the person recently, it would typically be interpreted to mean that you were thinking about them."

If you are in an exclusive relationship with your romantic interest, there are several Mandarin phrases you can use to let them know that they are your \"one and only.\" These phrases let your romantic interest know that they are special and loved.

If you want to show someone that you're interested in them romantically or find them attractive, complimenting them is a good start. At the least, you've indicated that you think of them positively.

[8] X Research source You might also try \"wǒ xǐhuān nǐ\" (我喜欢(歡)你), which means \"I've got a crush on you,\" or \"wǒ rènwéi nǐ bù jǐnjǐn zhǐ shì yí gè péngyǒu\" (我认为你不仅仅只是一个朋友/我認為你不僅僅只是一個朋友), which means \"I think of you as more than a friend.\" [9] X Research source"

If you say \"nǐ duì wǒ éryán rúcǐ zhòngyào\" (你对我而言如此重要) to someone, you're saying \"you mean so much to me.\" While this phrase is typically used in a romantic context, you could also use it with a friend or family member who has gone out of their way to help you out. [10] X Research source When you say this to someone, they will see that you recognize and appreciate their efforts and care deeply for them."

      "content": "Do something nice for the person you love. Many Chinese people believe that your actions truly speak louder than your words. It's likely that your loved one will gauge how much they mean to you by what you do for them rather than how often you say romantic things to them. For example, you might do a chore for them that you know they particularly dislike or have a difficult time doing. You might also cook them their favorite meal, record their favorite TV show for them, or get them tickets to a concert you know they'll enjoy."

      "content": "Make something special for the person you love. You don't have to be particularly crafty or artistic to make something creative that the person you love will cherish. Just the fact that you made it with them in mind will warm their heart. For example, you might print photos of the two of you together and make a scrapbook of your relationship and all the adventures you've been on. You might also make a sign or poster related to the person or something they enjoy. If you're musically inclined, you might consider writing a song that tells the person how much they mean to you."

      "content": "Demonstrate affection through gestures and touch. Chinese people express their love more often nonverbally. If you love someone, let them know by holding their hand frequently and putting your arm around them. Leaning next to them or cuddling while the two of you are engaged in something else lets them know that you're attached to them. For example, you might put your arms around your significant other's waist as they're cooking, or massage their shoulders as they're reading or working."

      "content": "Write a love letter to your romantic interest. Ornate, handwritten letters are cherished in Chinese culture, so if you write a love letter to your romantic interest in Chinese you'll be certain to capture their attention (and their heart). In this kind of letter, you can afford to be more serious without having to worry that you'll offend them. [11] X Research source For example, \"wǒ ài nǐ\" (我爱你) would be much more appropriate in a formal love letter than if you simply said it. If you're just starting to learn Chinese , you might want to have a native speaker look over your letter before you give it to your beloved."
