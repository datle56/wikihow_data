      "content": "Set priorities. It is easy to become overwhelmed when studying, especially when you have a very limited amount of time. Determine study topics in highest need of studying and in least need of studying. [1] X Expert Source Jai Flicker Academic Tutor Expert Interview. 20 May 2020. Create a study checklist. Make a column listing the reading, assignments, lecture notes and handouts that were covered in class. Next, highlight the areas where you are the weakest. In addition, highlight areas that received the most attention during instruction. Identify areas in your notes where you have vague or insufficient information. Review a classmate’s notes to help fill in these gaps. Setting priorities are important, but be sure to not over prepare. Avoid trying to study all of the material covered in class. Your instructor will most likely test you on the most important ideas and concepts, so focus your attention on this."

      "content": "Choose your study area wisely. Where you study is as important as what you study. You need to study in a place that is free from distractions and conducive to learning. [2] X Expert Source Jai Flicker Academic Tutor Expert Interview. 20 May 2020. Choose a place to study that is free from TV or computer distractions.

      "title": "Take breaks.",
      "content": "Take breaks. Your brain needs time to process and rejuvenate when obtaining a significant amount of information. Avoid studying for longer than 2 hours at a time without taking a break. Ideally, take short 5-minute breaks after each hour of studying and longer breaks after longer stretches of studying. [5] X Expert Source Jai Flicker Academic Tutor Expert Interview. 20 May 2020. Plan to take a break for a certain amount of time and stick to that schedule. If you don’t, you may lose focus.

      "title": "Create an outline.",
      "content": "Create an outline. An outline is a useful way of focusing your attention on just the most important information. With an outline, you capture only the most important words, thus allowing you to retain what matters the most. If you’re doing a literary or rhetorical analysis or revising your own work, create a reverse outline. Make 2 columns and put the topic of each paragraph on the left-hand side. Briefly explain how the paragraph pertains to the focus or argument of the text on the right-hand side. [6] X Research source When creating an outline, make sure to put the information in your own words. This will make the information more meaningful and easier to recall. If you are copying someone else’s outline, also use your own words. Otherwise, you are likely to forget the information. [7] X Research source"

This type of mnemonic device and many others are useful in retaining information while studying. Create acronyms as a way of retaining information. For example, the acronym H.O.M.E.S is used to remember the 5 Great Lakes (Huron, Ontario, Michigan, Erie, Superior). [9] X Research source Use word and picture associations to recall what you study to connect new words and definitions to words and images that you can easily recall.

Therefore, a waxing moon is a moon whose illuminated surface increases. [11] X Research source"

      "content": "Engage your senses. You probably recognize that you have a preferred way of learning. For example, you might prefer auditory learning activities such as listening to a lecture, or perhaps you prefer visual activities such as reading notes. [12] X Research source However, the more senses you involve in learning, the more information you will retain. When reviewing a concept, try to incorporate reading, writing, listening, and speaking throughout your study time. For example, if you were reviewing the parts of the body, you would not only read the definition and function of each part, but also draw a diagram and discuss the importance of each part with a study partner.

      "content": "Create study flashcards. Flashcards are an easy to make and an effective method for recalling and retaining information. They are also easily portable, so you can take them with you to review at anytime you want. Create term flashcards by placing the term on one side and the definition on the other side. For math flashcards, write the math problem on one side with examples on the other. To study an illustration, on one side draw a picture with an arrow pointing to the area of focus, and the answer on the other side. [14] X Research source"

      "content": "Study with others. Do you ever notice how more motivated you feel when exercising with others? Oftentimes, studying with others can be a morale booster as well. Be sure to have a clear plan when working with a study group to maximize its benefits. Ideally, keep your study group to about 3 to 6 people. Choose academically conscientious group members who have a track of record of focusing in class, taking notes, and performing well on exams. Be sure to set some group ground rules and expectations that all group members agree on. Also, set clear goals and objectives to help your study group remain focused. As a group, determine the structure of your study session. Decide how much time you will study and how much time will be devoted to various tasks. Two to three hours should be sufficient. Spend the first half of your study session clearing up any confusion or misunderstandings that individual group members have about the material. This will allow for other group members to clarify any problems or misconceptions. To clarify misunderstandings of specific study questions, check to make sure group members understand what the question is asking, the concepts being addressed in the question, and the steps taken to solve the problem."

Not only will this get you up and moving, but it also gives you some much-needed time to socialize."
