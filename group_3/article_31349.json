      "title": "A dirty charging port will cause your Switch to not charge.",
      "content": "A dirty charging port will cause your Switch to not charge. This is because the charging cable won't have good contact inside the port to transfer the charge. Use a flashlight to check to see if your ports need to be cleaned, and if so, clean them out with compressed air. Take this time to also check your Switch for damage. If your device's port is visibly damaged, this is likely the culprit for your device not charging, and you'll either need to get your charging port fixed or replaced."

      "content": "Loose cables in your dock can lead to charging issues. Make sure all of the cables are plugged in tightly and that the cables are not damaged. If you notice any visible wear and tear on the cables, you should replace them with new ones. If you notice that your dock's power cable is worn out, make sure to purchase an official Nintendo Switch replacement cable. Third-party cables are not recommended by Nintendo."

      "content": "Sometimes a quick reboot is all you'll need to do to get your Switch to charge. Anecdotally, some users have found that doing a soft reboot of their Switch helped fix this charging issue. [2] X Research source To do this, simply follow these steps: Press the Switch's power button for 15 seconds to enter safe mode. Press the volume up button, volume down button, and power buttons all at the same time to reboot your Switch. Once the Switch reboots, plug it back in to see if it will charge."

      "title": "Try a different outlet to see if the outlet is the culprit.",
      "content": "Try a different outlet to see if the outlet is the culprit. Plugging your Switch dock's power cord into a different outlet can help identify whether the issue is with your outlet or your charging cable. If you identify that there's an issue with your outlet, you should repair the outlet to avoid potentially damaging your electronics."
    },
    {
      "title": "The charging problem could be related to the dock.",
      "content": "The charging problem could be related to the dock. If something is wrong with your Switch's dock, you won't be able to use it to charge your Switch. To identify if that's the problem, try removing your Switch from the dock and plugging it directly into the Nintendo Switch AC adapter. If your Switch still won't charge, it could be a problem with the adapter itself, or with the outlet."

    {
      "title": "If you aren't using an official Switch charger, try using one instead.",
      "content": "If you aren't using an official Switch charger, try using one instead. If you don't have another Switch charging cord, you can try a different USB-C cable in a pinch. However, Nintendo doesn't recommend using anything other than the official Nintendo Switch AC adapter to charge your device."
