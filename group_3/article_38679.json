      "content": "Research your LEGOs to find out what sets you have. LEGOs are typically sold as collections, sets, mini figures, or parts. If you do not have your original packaging or you're unsure which LEGOs you have, inspect your LEGOs for a part number and then look up the numbers online. [2] X Research source Once you have the part numbers you can search for them online by entering the number and the word “legos.” In most cases, the BrickLink catalog website will have your parts listed. The theme or franchise of your LEGO can have a significant impact on value."

      "title": "Sort general pieces by color or shape.",
      "content": "Sort general pieces by color or shape. If you have parts that are not part of a set, make your own groupings to sell together. It's best to either make packs of specific colors or specific shapes. If you have unique pieces, such as jewel rocks, you can list them individually. [4] X Research source Your groupings can range from 2 pieces to hundreds of pieces. With specialty pieces, such as antennas, it's best to group just a few together. With general building blocks, you can make groups of hundreds if you have that many. When you make a grouping, write down how many pieces there are and what shape they are in so that you can use this information in your listing."

      "title": "Pick a general online selling platform for selling common LEGOs.",
      "content": "Pick a general online selling platform for selling common LEGOs. There are a wide variety of websites that allow you to sell LEGOs. The most popular, and easiest to use, is eBay. eBay is a website where all kinds of items are sold. However, there are also a variety of other sites, including buyback stores. [6] X Research source Online buyback stores typically have a form, email address, or phone number to call to start the sales process. They'll ask for a description of your LEGOs, and they might ask for a photo. If they're interested, they'll make you an offer. If you accept, you'll ship your LEGO to them and they'll pay you in cash or store credit. Examples of such stores include The Plastic Brick, Toy Brick Brigade, and Replay Bricks. If you already have an eBay account, it will be easy to sell your LEGOs on that website."

Include set and mini figure names, collection weights, conditions, status of the packaging (missing, damaged, or new), and anything else you know about your LEGOs. [8] X Research source List everything that is included in the sale, as well as any parts that are missing from sets. If you're selling a LEGO collection, you do not need to identify each individual piece, as long as they are all included. If applicable, include your payment and shipping policies. This should include under what conditions you will accept returns. However, on some websites, the shipping costs and policies are set by the company, not you."

    {
      "title": "Include photos in your listing.",
      "content": "Include photos in your listing. Take high-quality photos from multiple angles to make it easy to understand what you're selling. Having clear photos of the exact LEGOs you are selling will make your pieces sell much quicker than without them. Show any discoloring, scratches, and cracks in the photos. This will help you avoid disputes and poor ratings because your buyer won't be able to claim that they didn't know what state the LEGOs are in."

      "title": "Ask for a fair price to facilitate quick and hassle-free sales.",
      "content": "Ask for a fair price to facilitate quick and hassle-free sales.

Make a decision and set a price that you will be happy with, even if it takes awhile to make a sale. [9] X Research source Include how much shipping will cost, including whether the buyer will pay it separately or if it is included in the asking price. Collections are typically worth between $5 to $15 per pound, depending on their makeup: mostly bricks, mostly mini figures, a mix of non-LEGO parts (like Hotwheels tires), etc."

      "content": "Sell to brick-and-mortar stores that deal in LEGOs. Toy stores and pawn shops often buy used LEGOs. Take your LEGOs in to the store to see if they're interested in buying. You can find local brick-and-mortar stores with a quick online search. [11] X Research source This is a quick way to sell your LEGOs but it won't get you the highest price in most cases."

      "title": "List your LEGOs on local classifieds sites.",
      "content": "List your LEGOs on local classifieds sites. Websites like Craigslist and Facebook Marketplace are great places to sell LEGOs without having to ship them.
