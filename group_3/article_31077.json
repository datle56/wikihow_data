      "title": "The MBTI model assesses personalities on four axes, or “preferences.”",
      "content": "The MBTI model assesses personalities on four axes, or “preferences.” In this case, a preference is how you orient yourself when focusing your mind or using your brain to make decisions. While you might naturally prefer to do things one way according to your personality type, that doesn’t mean you can’t do things any other way—it just might not be your first instinct. To understand the MBTI personality types , consider these four axes: [11] X Research source Extraversion (E) vs. Introversion (I): Extraverts gain energy from interacting with the outer world, people and things, while introverts fuel up by focusing inward on concepts and ideas. Sensing (S) vs. Intuition (N): Those who prefer sensing focus on concrete, tangible details, while those who use intuition look for patterns and future possibilities to construct the “big picture.” Thinking (T) vs. Feeling (F): Thinkers rely on impersonal facts and logic to make decisions, whereas feelers consider personal concerns, relationships, and the people involved. Judging (J) vs. Perceiving (P): Those who judge prefer a structured life and control their world through planning and decision-making (judging), while those who perceive prefer a flexible lifestyle and interact with the world through information gathering (perceiving)."
