There are a variety of solutions you can use for the job: [7] X Research source Hot water and a few squirts of dish soap. This works perfectly well on most wallpaper paste. Fill up a gallon-sized bucket with the solution. Hot water and vinegar. This is great for tougher jobs. Mix a gallon of hot water and a gallon of white distilled vinegar.

If you don't want to use a sponge, you can use a spray bottle. Pour the solution into the bottle and spray a 5 x 5 foot area with the wallpaper paste remover. Wait 5 minutes for the paste to soften.
