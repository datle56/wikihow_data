      "content": "Gather a small group of players. Although Simon Says is normally a children’s activity, all ages can play and enjoy the game. Gather a few friends and family members together so you have a few players. [1] X Research source Simon Says works best with 5 or more people, but you can play short games with fewer players. Normally, all the players in Simon Says remain standing for the duration of the playing round, but you can also play while sitting down if it’s more comfortable."

      "content": "Give commands as Simon to eliminate players. Whenever Simon is ready, they can start giving commands to the rest of the group. If you begin a command with “Simon says…”, the listeners have to obey and do what you tell them. If you simply state the command, then the listeners should not follow the instructions. If a listener incorrectly follows Simon’s instructions, they’re eliminated for the rest of the game. [2] X Research source Give your commands quickly and frequently switch up whether you say “Simon says…” to confuse the listeners. Some common commands you can give include: Touch your toes Hop on one foot Dance around the room Do some jumping jacks Give yourself a hug Play air guitar"

      "title": "Obey “Simon says” commands as a listener.",
      "content": "Obey “Simon says” commands as a listener. When you’re playing as a listener, pay attention very carefully to the commands given by Simon. Only follow the instructions if they say “Simon says…” before the command. Simon will try to trick you into obeying commands you shouldn’t by giving the commands very quickly. If you don’t follow the instructions correctly, then you’re eliminated for the rest of the round. If Simon gives a command, keep performing it until the next time they say “Simon says…” For example, if they say “Simon says hop on one foot,” then keep hopping on that foot until they say “Simon says stop.” Wait a second before performing a command to make sure you heard Simon correctly."

      "title": "Win the game if you’re the last remaining listener.",
      "content": "Win the game if you’re the last remaining listener. During the round, Simon keeps giving commands until there is only one listener left. That player is the winner for the round and becomes the new Simon for the next round. All the eliminated players are back in the next game."

      "title": "Give listeners a strike instead of eliminating them right away.",
      "content": "Give listeners a strike instead of eliminating them right away. Give each player 3 or 5 strikes for the round of the game. When a listener follows an instruction incorrectly, they gain 1 strike. When they hit the set amount of strikes, then they’re eliminated from the game. [3] X Research source Players could also say a letter to spell out a word when they make a mistake. For example, strikes can spell out H-O-R-S-E like the basketball game Horse. Once a player spells out the entire word, they are eliminated."

      "title": "Change Simon’s name to fit a different theme.",
      "content": "Change Simon’s name to fit a different theme. During holidays or certain festivities, the leader of the ground can change their name from Simon to a more fitting character. If you’re playing at a birthday party, you could say “Birthday boy says….” If you’re playing sometime around Valentine's Day, try saying “Cupid says…” instead. On the Fourth of July, you could say Uncle Sam instead of Simon."

      "title": "Incorporate sports activities into the commands.",
      "content": "Incorporate sports activities into the commands. Simon Says can be translated into a fun training activity for any sports team, especially teams that have older kids. Give out different drills as commands, or assign exercises as punishments for following a command incorrectly. For example, a volleyball version of Simon Says would include all volleyball-related commands like: Block – All players jump up to block Dive – All players pretend to dive for a ball Defense – All players go into their defensive, ready position Shuffle – All players would shuffle in the direction indicated by Simon"
