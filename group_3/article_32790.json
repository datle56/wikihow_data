You can read these results to get an idea of the connection strength between your computer and the address you pinged. The \"time=#ms\" (where \"#\" is a number) tag refers to the number of milliseconds it took for the address to respond to your ping. The lower the number of milliseconds per ping, the stronger your connection to the computer or address you're pinging. After stopping the ping command, the Terminal will print a recap of what happened. It will tell you how many packets were sent, how many packets were received, and what the average round trip of a package is. If you receive fewer packets than you sent, you're experiencing what is known as packet loss. The terminal will display packet loss as a percentage. Packet loss can be caused by a poor Wi-Fi connection, ISP-side internet issues, or an overloaded connection. It manifests as lag in video games, slow downloads, and choppy video playback, to name a few. [1] X Research source Check out our article on fixing packet loss if you're experiencing it."

There are a few errors you might encounter when running the ping command: Unknown host: This error could mean that the host or domain does not exist, but it also may mean the name cannot be translated into an IP address by your DNS servers. Destination host unreachable: This error means your computer was unable to send any packets to the address. It could be an issue on your end or somewhere between your computer and the host destination. Request timed out: This error means your computer sent the ping request but did not receive a reply. The host may not be online, there could be a network problem on the host's end, or the ping could've been blocked by the host's firewall. Name or service not known: This error means the hostname or address you're trying to ping does not exist. If the host does exist, there's a problem with your network configuration."
