      "title": "Use a measuring tape, pencil, and paper to record your measurements.",
      "content": "Use a measuring tape, pencil, and paper to record your measurements. Find a fabric measuring tape that will wrap around your body, as well as a piece of paper and pencil or pen. It's best to use the measuring tape in inches, as this is how most UK bra measurements are taken. [1] X Research source It may be useful to use a full-length mirror to see yourself as well."

      "title": "Pull the measuring tape around your ribcage to find the band size.",
      "content": "Pull the measuring tape around your ribcage to find the band size. The measuring tape should go right under your bust where the band of your bra would sit. Pull the measuring tape so that it's snug but not too tight or loose, making sure it's in an even line around your body. Write down the band size on a piece of paper in inches, as this is how most bra sizes are taken in the UK. [2] X Research source Stand up straight and have someone help you if necessary to ensure the measuring tape gives you an accurate measurement."

      "title": "Round your measurements to a multiple of five if using centimeters.",
      "content": "Round your measurements to a multiple of five if using centimeters. If you'd rather take your measurements in centimeters, you'll need to round your measurements up or down to the nearest multiple of five before writing them down. Since bra sizes are mainly taken in inches, you'll need to go online and find a bra size calculator to then convert your measurements. For example, if you measured your band size as 83 cm (33 in), you'd round that number down to 80. When you plug your measurements into the online calculator, it will convert them from centimeters to inches before telling you your bra size."

      "title": "Measure around the fullest part of your bust for the cup measurement.",
      "content": "Measure around the fullest part of your bust for the cup measurement. Pull the measuring tape around your bust to find the cup measurement—this will be the fullest part of your chest, about where your nipples are. Make sure the measuring tape is in an even line around your body, and write down the number so you don't forget. [3] X Research source Many people say it's easiest to get an accurate measurement by wearing a non-padded bra, though you can measure yourself braless as well."

    {
      "title": "Round both measurements to the nearest whole number.",
      "content": "Round both measurements to the nearest whole number. Once you've measured around your ribcage for your band size and around your chest for your cup measurement, round these numbers up to the nearest whole inch. If your band size is an odd number, add 1 to make it even. [4] X Research source Band and cup measurements of 29.8 in (76 cm) and 34.6 in (88 cm) would round up to 30 in (76 cm) and 35 in (89 cm) respectively. If you measured a band size of 31 in (79 cm), you would round it up to the even number 32 in (81 cm)."
    },
    {
      "title": "Subtract the band measurement from the cup measurement.",
      "content": "Subtract the band measurement from the cup measurement. Take the rounded up measurements and subtract them from each other to end up with your cup size. The number difference between these two measurements will correlate to a letter. For example, a 1-inch difference would be an A, 2-inches a B, 3-inches a C, and so on. [5] X Research source For example, if you subtract your band measurement from your cup measurement and get 4, you're a D cup. A band measurement of 34 and a cup measurement of 37 would be a difference of 3, or a C. If you're not sure which sizes correlate to which numbers, go online to find a cup size chart to refer to."

      "title": "Put the band size with the cup size to find out your bra size.",
      "content": "Put the band size with the cup size to find out your bra size. Now that you have all of your measurements, just place your band size in front of your cup size and you're done! For example, if your band size is 34 and your cup size is a C, your bra size is 34C. [6] X Research source Note that bra sizes vary widely between bra companies, so use this bra size as a reference point."

      "content": "Use an online bra size calculator to find your size in a specific brand. After you've taken your band measurement and cup measurement, you can have the web calculate your bra size for you by typing them in to a bra size calculator. To find a site that will do these calculations for you, type “bra size calculator” into a search engine online. [7] X Research source Most bra size calculators are found on a specific bra company's site, so be aware that you may get different sizes from different companies depending on how they measure bras."

      "content": "Try a bra on in person before committing to it. This is the best way to determine whether a bra fits you well. Even if you've calculated your bra size according to the measurements, you won't know for sure if a bra is right for you unless you can try it on and evaluate whether it's comfortable and supportive. [8] X Research source If you ordered a bra online, keep the tags attached while trying it on in case it doesn't fit well and you need to return it."

      "title": "Make sure the bra straps don't pinch or fall down.",
      "content": "Make sure the bra straps don't pinch or fall down. If your bra straps are causing marks in your shoulders, or they're slipping off of your shoulders throughout the day, this is a sign that you're not wearing the right size. A fitted bra should have straps that sit on your shoulders comfortably without falling down or causing pain. [9] X Research source Make sure your bra straps are even on both sides."

      "title": "Look for a band that is firm and straight.",
      "content": "Look for a band that is firm and straight. If your bra band is riding up on your back or is uneven in any place, it's not the right size. Your band should rest evenly around your body without pulling up or down, and you should be able to fit two fingers under it snugly. [10] X Research source Look in a mirror to ensure the band goes straight across your body and isn't uneven in any spots."

      "content": "Check that the bra bridge sits flat on your body. The bra bridge is the piece of fabric that connects each cup of your bra, resting in the middle of your chest. This part should lay flat on your body without any room underneath. [11] X Research source"

      "content": "Put on a tight-fitting shirt to see if your bra is visible. If you can see the lines of your bra or any skin bulging, it's likely that this bra isn't the right size. Ideally, your bra won't be seen or felt when it's properly fitted. [12] X Research source The cups of your bra should be smooth and moulded to your breasts. If your bust is spilling out of your cups, you need to go up a size or two."

Stores that sell bras know how challenging it can be to find the perfect bra, so many stores have employees that will measure you for the right bra while you're there.
