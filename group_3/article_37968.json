      "title": "Salam alaikum means “peace be upon you.”",
      "content": "Salam alaikum means “peace be upon you.” “Salam Alaikum” is an Arabic greeting that literally translates into “peace be upon you.” It can be used by both Muslims and non-Muslims in the Arabic-speaking world and is, in fact, used by many Arabic-speaking Christians and Jews. One of the main pillars of Islam is the spread of peace and “salam” is Arabic for “peace,” which is why Muslims are encouraged to use this as a greeting among one another. [1] X Research source “As-Salam” is one of the 99 names of Allah as mentioned in the Quran, meaning “The Giver of Peace.” While the grammar and pronunciation of the phrase varies across regions and dialects, \"as-salamu alaykum\" is one of the most common pronunciations. In a casual setting, you can use the shortened “salam” which simply means “peace.”"

      "content": "The greeting is used whenever Muslims or Arabic speakers gather. Whether Muslims are gathered at a religious service, event, or at home, greeting one another with \"salam alaikum\" is expected and encouraged. Spreading peace is one of the main principles of Islam, along with declarations of faith, charity work, prayer, and fasting. “Salam Alaikum” supports the Islamic practices of spreading peace and humility between social classes, strengthening bonds with the community, and the reassurance of faith. [2] X Research source Muslims are encouraged to exchange these greetings at all gatherings, as it is written in the Quran. An-Nisa 4:86 reads, “And when you are greeted, respond with a better greeting or at least similarly. Surely Allah is a [vigilant] Reckoner of all things.” [3] X Research source The greeting should be initially exchanged by one person walking toward a seated person, by those of an upper class to those of a lower one, and from the young to the old. Despite these observed social rules, it’s never a bad thing to say “salam alaikum” first."

      "title": "The appropriate response to “salam alaikum” is “wa alaikum salam.”",
      "content": "The appropriate response to “salam alaikum” is “wa alaikum salam.” If an Arabic-speaker greets you with their native salutation of “salam alaikum,” meaning, “peace be upon you,” you may reply with, “wa alaikum salam,” meaning, “peace be also with you.” A longer, more formal reply is, “assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh.” This iteration is not only a greeting but a declaration of faith among Muslims, translating into, “Peace be upon you and God’s mercy and blessings.” [4] X Research source The person being greeted should meet, or preferably exceed, the other’s generosity in their reply. The more generosity you offer in your reply, the more favored you are perceived to be by Allah."

      "content": "It’s not offensive unless it’s being mocked or culturally appropriated. The peaceful greeting is highly encouraged by Islam as a means of spreading peace, one of the major tenets of the religion. While it’s used by Arabic speakers everywhere, whether they be Muslim, Christian, Jewish, or other, the context in which you’re saying “salam alaikum” is important. [5] X Research source If you’re Muslim, the use of the greeting is not only allowed but incentivized, as spreading peace to humanity is one of the ways to guarantee entry into heaven. If you’re a non-Muslim Arabic speaker, greeting someone with “salam alaikum” might simply be part of your culture and something you don't need to second-guess. If you’re a non-Muslim, non-native speaker of Arabic, you should never open with “salam alaikum” unless greeted by a Muslim in this way. Then, you may respectfully reply with “wa alaikum salam.”"

      "content": "“Salam” or “peace” is one of the foundations of Islam. “Salam” or “peace” is one of the 99 names of Allah, or God, and carries great significance to Muslims everywhere. When a Muslim greets you with “salam alaikum,” they are expressing their most earnest wishes for your safety, protection, and good fortune, acting as a verbal shield from evil. It showcases purity of heart and goodness between friends, family members, and even strangers. [6] X Research source The phrase appears 7 times in the Quran, written as “salamun ʿalaykum.” According to the Quran, the first instructions Muhammed gave upon arriving in Medina, or the first Islamic state, was to spread peace. [7] X Research source He also meant for the greeting to be shared with every Muslim, stating, “You feed others and offer greetings to both those you know and those you do not know.” [8] X Research source The longer the variation of the greeting– whether it be “wa alaikum salam,” “assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh,” or others—the more favor one gains with Allah. Islam is a religion founded on peace, and promoting peace is one of the most important philosophies Muslims live by."

      "content": "The Hebrew equivalent is “shalom aleichem.” Meaning “peace be upon you” in Hebrew, this similar Semitic variation doesn’t stray too far from the original. Exchanged between Jews everywhere and frequently used by Ashkenazi Jews, the phrase holds a more concrete religious meaning than its Arabic counterpart. The correct response to this greeting is “aleichem shalom,” which means, “unto you peace.” [9] X Research source The greeting appears 6 times in the Talmud, or book of rabbinic scriptures. The popular song, “Shalom Aleichem,” is often sung before the Friday evening Shabbat meal. It was composed by Rabbi Israel Goldfarb in 1918. [10] X Research source"

      "content": "In Pakistan and India, the greeting is paired with a handshake or hug. Pakistan’s population is comprised of 253 million residents as of 2025, with 96.5% of the population being Muslim. Therefore, the Muslim greeting, “salam alaikum,” is common and relatively formal, typically paired with a right handshake. Then, both people briefly place their hands over their hearts as a token of respect. [14] X Research source In Pakistan, two people may hug when greeting if they haven’t seen each other in a while or otherwise share a close bond. Exchanging physical affection between opposite genders when greeting one another is usually reserved for people who are family or very close friends.
