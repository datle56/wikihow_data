      "content": "Learn how slots work. Despite the seeming variety, the general rules of every slot are the same. Almost every slot has reels, symbols, and paylines. Advanced video slots also have special symbols, like wilds and scatters, that enhance your gameplay, activate special features like bonus rounds and free spins, and grant extra winnings. Here’s a short glossary: Reel - a vertical line where symbols are located. Usually there are 3-5 reels in a slot, and each reel fits 3-5 symbols. Symbol - basically, any image that is used to create a winning combination along the payline. Payline - a virtual line that goes across the reels, usually from left to right. A win occurs when you get a certain number of matching symbols on an active payline as indicated in the game’s help screen. Wild symbol - a so-called Joker in slots that substitutes other symbols to create a winning combination. For example, if you get three Cherry symbols and a Wild on an active payline, it counts as four Cherries. Scatter symbol - a special symbol in advanced slots. The special thing about it is that it doesn’t have to appear on an active payline to trigger a win. It may be “scattered” across the reels. In most cases it also activates some kind of bonus round. Bonus round - a mini-round within a slot game that grants extra winnings. It may be a simple “pick one of the three chests” game, where your pick determines the win amount, a complex multilevel videogame-like experience with shooting aliens, or anything in-between. Free spins - another form of a bonus, where you get a number of spins that don’t reduce your balance. It sometimes comes with additional features like extra Wild symbols, win multipliers, etc."

      "content": "Register at the casino. The registration process is usually very simple and requires you to fill in your email and personal details like post address, date of birth, and full name. The casino needs this information to verify your identity in order to pay out the winnings, so make sure the information is correct. Be sure to choose an online casino that is legal in your region. For example, if you're in Canada, you'll want to choose an online casino that is licensed to operate in Canada."

      "title": "Choose a slot.",
      "content": "Choose a slot. While you can choose whichever game you like based on your personal preferences, there are two things you should keep in mind - RTP and Variance. RTP - stands for Return to Player. This is a theoretical percentage a game gives back to players in the long term. For example, if the RTP of a slot is 97%, it means that for every €100 wagered it returns €97 as payouts, keeping €3 in the casino. Note that this number doesn’t necessarily apply to your particular gaming session, but rather to billions of spins made by all players in total in the lifespan of the game. You may win €1000, and it would mean that a hundred other players lost €10 each. The opposite is also true. Good casinos usually publish this information somewhere on the website. Some slots also have this information available in the game rules. Variance - this is basically how often a slots pays out. Low variance slots pay smaller winnings often. High variance slots are the opposite: you may not get any wins for a while, but when the win comes - it’s big. This may result in the same overall RTP, so it’s just a matter of personal preference."

      "title": "Learn when to stop.",
      "content": "Learn when to stop. However much fun you have while spinning the reels, at some point you will have to stop. Set your bankroll limit before you begin and stick to it. It may also be a good idea to set a win limit. For example, tell yourself to stop when you win 20% over your initial bankroll. This way you’ll save your money for withdrawal or for the next gaming session."
