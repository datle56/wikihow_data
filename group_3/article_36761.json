Then, lining up the \"v\" with the tick's head, slide the card under the tick. Now, try to gently edge the tick's head from your dog's skin with the card. [1] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source The goal is to remove the tick entirely, especially the head. These parasites attach to your dog via tiny hooks in the skin. Attempting to forcefully rip the tick from your dog's skin risks leaving the head attached."

      "title": "Use dental floss to pull the tick out.",
      "content": "Use dental floss to pull the tick out. Unspool a length of dental floss—6 in (15 cm) is more than enough. Loop the dental floss around the tick’s mouthparts, wrapping as close to the skin as possible. Tie a knot on the other side of the tick to form a small circle around the parasite's belly. Finally, tug upwards on the string to pull the tick from your dog’s skin. [2] X Research source If you’re having trouble looping close enough to the skin, try using a straw. Loop and tie your floss around the straw. Place the straw over the belly of the tick, with the end as close to the head as possible. Then, slide the floss off of the straw."

      "title": "Force the tick to detach using heat and a needle.",
      "content": "Force the tick to detach using heat and a needle. Heat a needle by holding it inside a flame for a few seconds, preferably with a match. Hold the hot needle directly on top of the tick—if possible, on the parasite's head. Now, wait. The heat may encourage the tick to dislodge its head. [3] X Research source Note that this approach involves risk. If the tick dies while still attached to your dog's skin, removing the head could become even more challenging. Heat can also cause the tick to produce more saliva. This saliva can carry diseases that can infect your pet with illnesses. If you're in a pinch, you may decide this method is still worth trying. But if you have other options available, try something with less risk first."
