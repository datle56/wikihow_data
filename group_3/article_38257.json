      "title": "Say “cảm ơn” to express thanks in a casual and friendly way.",
      "content": "Say “cảm ơn” to express thanks in a casual and friendly way. The nearest equivalent to the English phrase “thanks,” in Vietnamese uses the words “cảm” and “ơn.” These two words together translate literally to the directive to “feel favor.” Use “cảm ơn” when thanking someone informally. [1] X Research source In English, the phrase “thank you” has the person you are addressing built in – “you.” In Vietnamese, however, you’ll also need to add a word to indicate the person you are addressing."
    },
    {
      "title": "Pronounce “cảm ơn” like “gauhm uhhn.”",
      "content": "Pronounce “cảm ơn” like “gauhm uhhn.” Since Vietnamese is a tonal language, pronunciation is extremely important to the meaning of both words and phrases. When you’re hoping to say “thank you,” say “cảm” in a broken falling tone, and “ơn” in a flat tone. Since it is hard to imagine these sounds from simply reading about them, listen to recordings of the phrase online. [2] X Research source When pronounced correctly, “cảm ơn” will sound like “gauhm uhhn.” The “auh” portion of the first word is sounded out in a rising, then falling voice."

      "title": "Include a personal pronoun to make your \"thank you\" more distinctive.",
      "content": "Include a personal pronoun to make your \"thank you\" more distinctive. Increase the politeness of your expression by including a personal pronoun corresponding with the person you are addressing. In other words, say, “cám ơn,” in addition to an appropriate word for “you” in Vietnamese. [3] X Research source Use “bà,” pronounced “baa,” when addressing an older woman, and “cô,” pronounced “coh,” to address a young girl. Use “ông”, pronounced “ohng,” to address a man who is older than you, and “anh,” pronounced “ang,” when thanking a young man. For instance; “cám ơn cô” means “thank you,” as you would say it to a young woman."

      "title": "Emphasize your gratitude by adding “nhiều lắm.”",
      "content": "Emphasize your gratitude by adding “nhiều lắm.” Add “nhiều lắm,” pronounced “nyee-oh luhm,” after saying “cảm ơn” to express especially strong gratitude. This addition indicates the English equivalent of \"a lot\" or “so much.” Accordingly, say, “cảm ơn nhiều lắm,” pronounced “gauhm uhhn nyee-oh luhm,” if you’re hoping to more strongly convey your gratitude.

      "title": "Say thank you in formal settings by starting with “xin.”",
      "content": "Say thank you in formal settings by starting with “xin.” The Vietnamese language includes another word to help express appreciation in contexts that requires extreme formality and politeness. In particular, the word “xin,” which translates to “to ask” or even “to beg” is placed before “cảm ơn.” Altogether, say “xin cảm ơn,” pronounced like “sin gauhm uhhn.”"

      "content": "Try some of these other common expressions of gratitude. If you want to go above and beyond simply saying “thank you,” there are a few other expressions that can help convey your deep sense of gratitude. To say “thank you very much,” add “rất” ahead of “cảm ơn,” pronounced “zhat gauhm uhhn.” [5] X Research source If you want to explicitly say, “I appreciate you,” you can say, “tôi đánh giá cao nó.” Prounounce it, “toe den zha cow no.”"

      "title": "Smile when you receive a compliment to express your thanks.",
      "content": "Smile when you receive a compliment to express your thanks. Vietnamese culture dictates that smiles are often used to convey appreciation instead of a verbal expression of thanks. Think of a smile as a silent “thank you.” Modesty is highly respected in Vietnamese culture, and deflecting a compliment with a smile is the best way to express appreciation for a compliment modestly. Similarly, if you pay someone a compliment, do not expect them to express their gratitude verbally."

      "title": "Keep in mind that a smile can also mean \"hello\" or even \"sorry.\"",
      "content": "Keep in mind that a smile can also mean \"hello\" or even \"sorry.\" In English, people are often quick to say “hello,” as well as “thank you” and “sorry” in many different contexts. [6] X Research source In Vietnamese culture, a smile often takes the place of these phrases. In fact, anyone who is older or in a position of authority will usually not thank younger or subordinate people verbally, do don't be offended if you don't get a verbal thank you from them. In particular, do not expect someone who is your parents age or a teacher to say thank you. Instead, you will likely receive a nod."

      "title": "Use other nonverbal expressions with care.",
      "content": "Use other nonverbal expressions with care. In Vietnam, crossing your arms when expressing gratitude is a sign of respect. Some common physical gestures in Western culture, however, have different connotations in Vietnamese culture. For instance, avoid patting someone’s back or pointing while talking, as these actions will be perceived as disrespectful. [7] X Research source Similarly, avoid placing your hands in your pocket or on your hips, especially while expressing gratitude."

      "title": "Avoid holding eye contact to be respectful in Vietnam.",
      "content": "Avoid holding eye contact to be respectful in Vietnam. Eye contact with someone of a greater age or social status may be taken as a challenge. Meanwhile, eye contact with someone of the opposite gender indicates affection or desire. Accordingly, take care not to maintain eye contact with anyone who may misread your expression. In fact, avoiding eye contact is a sign of respect. [8] X Research source Since people maintain eye contact when speaking in many other cultures, averting your eyes may be hard to get used to. Practice looking away from a conversation partner's eyes before you go to Vietnam."

      "title": "Say “you’re welcome” with “không có gì.”",
      "content": "Say “you’re welcome” with “không có gì.” In Vietnamese, the equivalent of the English phrase “you’re welcome” is synonymous with “there isn’t any problem.” Accordingly, say, “không có gì” to say “it’s nothing” or “không có chi” to say “you’re welcome” when someone thanks you. [9] X Research source \"Không\" is spoken in a flat tone, while \"có\" is spoken in a rising tone. \"Không có chi\" is pronounced \"khong koh tsee.\" This expression is most common in North Vietnam. The version more popular in Central and Southern Vietnam is \"không có chi,\" with a stronger \"ch\" sound at the end."

      "content": "Say \"ón nghĩa gì,\" which means, \"It isn’t a big deal!\" Since Vietnam is a collectivist culture, people view helping one another as something essential to their core values. So, saying \"thank you\" and \"you're welcome\" in grand, formal ways is mainly reserved for really big favors. After someone gives you a huge help with something, you can say. \"Ơn nghĩa gì!\" [10] X Research source \"Ơn nghĩa gì\" is pronounced “ohn gilazeh.”"

      "content": "For a more formal reply, say, “Tôi rất vinh dự.” This is most appropriate in very formal or business settings, like if your boss gives you a promotion. Feel free to express how happy you are after they thank you for your hard work by saying, “tôi rất vinh dự!” It translates into, “It’s my honor!” ”Tôi rất vinh dự” is pronounced “toy zhat vin zhu.”"

      "title": "To respond to an acquaintance, say, “Tôi rất vui khi được giúp bạn.”",
      "content": "To respond to an acquaintance, say, “Tôi rất vui khi được giúp bạn.” This is the Vietnamese blend of the English phrases, “I’m pleased to help” and “It’s my pleasure,” resulting in a reply that means, “I’m pleasured to help.” This phrase should be used when speaking to a person you don’t know very well. ”Tôi rất vui khi được giúp bạn” is pronounced “toy zhat boy hee d’rock zhoot bohn.”"
