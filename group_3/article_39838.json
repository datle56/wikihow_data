Though magnesium’s effects haven’t been definitively proven, many people believe it improves sleep quality and reduces insomnia. It may affect your melatonin levels, which helps you fall asleep more quickly, and it can also help relax your muscles. Magnesium supplements can be purchased in the vitamin section of your pharmacy."

[12] X Research source White noise or natural sound machines are often wonderful. But if you cannot afford one, a fan can make a soothing noise. So can a radio tuned to \"between stations,\" where it creates static. Make sure that the radio is not too loud. Repetitive or ambient music is very good for falling asleep.

You may be more tired for the first few days, but this may help you sleep. After a week, if you're still not going to sleep quickly and staying asleep, reduce the sleep time by another 15 minutes. Continue reducing the sleep time by 15 minutes each week, until you are able to go to sleep quickly and stay asleep. (Waking up during the night is normal, as long as it's only for a few minutes.)
