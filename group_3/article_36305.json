  "steps": [
    {
      "title": "Try an eraser first.",
      "content": "Try an eraser first. If the ink stamp is light enough, an eraser by itself might do the trick. This will better protect the paper. Pencil erasers are fine as long as they're still soft. If you’re not making any progress after about five minutes, switch to something more abrasive."
    },
    {
      "title": "Acquire sandpaper.",
      "content": "Acquire sandpaper. Any type will work as long as the grit is between 150 and 400. The lower the grit, the higher the abrasiveness. If you’re using thin paper (such as notebook paper), opt for the highest grit possible. [1] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Tear off a section of sandpaper.",
      "content": "Tear off a section of sandpaper. Make sure it measures about 1 by 1 inch (2.5 by 2.5 cm). This will be small enough to focus on the ink stamp without affecting the surrounding area. [2] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Set up your work surface.",
      "content": "Set up your work surface. Place several sheets of scrap paper on your work surface. Pile them one on top of the other. This is to cushion your paper from the hard surface of the table so you may avoid tears. The number of sheets will depend on how thin your working paper is. Make sure your work surface is solid. A table should be fine. Clear away anything you won’t need."
    },
    {
      "title": "Set up the paper with the stamp.",
      "content": "Set up the paper with the stamp. Place it face-up on top of the scrap paper. Hold it down firmly with your free hand. Be sure to use all of your hand and not just your fingertips. Position this hand so that the inked area of the paper is visible between your thumb and index finger. Make sure the paper is perfectly flat."
    },
    {
      "title": "Sand the ink off the paper.",
      "content": "Sand the ink off the paper. Work away from your body. Use slow and gentle strokes. Avoid pressing too hard. Be patient. This method can be time-consuming. As you sand, hold the paper up to the light to make sure you're not in any danger of sanding through. When the sandpaper feels less gritty, you can clean it by holding it up and flicking the back of it."
    },
    {
      "title": "Alternate with an eraser.",
      "content": "Alternate with an eraser. Try erasing the ink as it becomes lighter. This mainly helps with any smearing effects from the sanding. Continue the process. Keep sanding the stamp. As the marks lighten, you can use the eraser to remove what remains. [3] X Research source Keep in mind the paper is weaker where you have sanded it, so be as gentle and patient as possible.

      "content": "Check the thickness of the paper. Make sure the page is at least as thick as the pages at the beginning and end of a typical library book. You can use this method on white or colored paper. You could also do this on the inside cover of the book. [5] X Research source For extra protection, it might help to place several sheets of scrap paper under the page you’re working on. If the page is thin like computer paper or notebook paper, use an eraser or sandpaper instead."

      "title": "Get a book repair knife.",
      "content": "Get a book repair knife. You can find these in specialty craft stores or online. Look for a blade that’s completely flat on one side with a deep bevel on the other. This will remove the ink stamp while protecting the page from damage. [6] X Research source Don’t use an X-Acto knife or butter knife. It will remove the stamp, but it will also damage the page."

      "title": "Begin scratching.",
      "content": "Begin scratching. Start with a letter or small design element in the stamp. Gently follow the shape of the letter or element as you scratch. Move in a back-and-forth motion with the tip of the blade. Be patient. This method can be time-consuming, but you will get professional results. [8] X Research source For example, if you’re removing a capital L, move the blade vertically on the long stem and horizontally on the shorter stem."

    {
      "title": "Use an eraser to remove remnants of the ink.",
      "content": "Use an eraser to remove remnants of the ink. As the letters or lines begin to lighten, try to erase them. Erase gently. Move in a regular motion as if you were erasing pencil marks. This will prevent damage that could come from additional scratching. Continue the process. [9] X Research source Keep scratching out individual letters or design elements with the knife. As they lighten, you can use the eraser to remove what remains."
