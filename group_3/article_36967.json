      "content": "Scare monkeys off yourself if there’s only one or two present. If you find a monkey has entered a residential area, don’t panic. Grab some big sticks, a hose, or another water spraying device handy at home to scare the monkey off without harming it. Monkeys will quickly learn that your neighborhood is not a good place for them to return to! [1] X Research source Stay safe around monkeys. Some monkeys may become aggressive when provoked. Do not approach a monkey directly, stare at it, or try to corner it. Identify an exit and encourage the monkey to leave by hitting the ground with a stick. Never hit a monkey. A strong jet of water directed toward the monkey can also encourage it towards the exit. Young monkeys may be more aggressive than mature adults. If there are juveniles in a group of monkeys, be especially cautious. Lower your head, keep your distance, and move away quickly and calmly. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Try using motion sensor lights, sprinklers, or speakers. To scare off lone monkeys, install motion-sensor lights or a camera to pick up on their movement around your property. There are several different types that may flash bright lights or spray the monkey with water to spook them away. Some even play predator animal sounds (like roaring lions) or other loud, scary noises like gunshots to frighten the monkeys off. [3] X Research source Keep in mind that eventually, monkeys may get used to the sounds, lights, or water and stop being deterred by them."

      "title": "Deploy an electronic sound repellent.",
      "content": "Deploy an electronic sound repellent. Increasingly, places and institutions frequented by monkeys are turning to ultrasound repellent devices to ward off the monkeys. These devices tend to be used where there are lots of people coming and going and it is hard to ensure that no rubbish or food waste is left accessible to monkeys in the area. The sounds cause stress and discomfort for monkeys in the area, who will move away to avoid the sound. A sound repellent’s impact on a monkey's health and well-being is uncertain, so more gentle preventative methods should be used first. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Install an electric fence around your property. In extreme circumstances, it might be necessary to construct an electric fence around your home or yard to stop large groups of monkeys from entering. [5] X Research source There is evidence that electric fences are effective at containing monkeys, and are unlikely to harm the animals if done correctly, but you will need expert help for this. [6] X Research source However, this is not a straightforward task and you should try less dramatic steps first like securing all outdoor garbage bins and closing off any food sources before considering this. If you think your monkey problem is this serious, contact a local government representative and ask them about electric fencing. Having an electric fence installed is not cheap, but it’s worth it to have a professional do it. Do not try to set up dangerous electrical equipment on your own."

      "content": "Try using natural deterrents like garlic or citrus in the garden. Monkeys have a good sense of smell and are repelled by strong scents they dislike. If monkeys are a problem in your yard or garden, place citrus peels, garlic cloves, or vinegar-soaked rags in strategic areas (like near plants you want to protect or entrances to your home). All of these scents together create an environment that most monkeys won’t want to explore. [7] X Research source Also consider companion planting, or planting monkey deterrent plants near ones you want to protect. For example, place marigolds, chili peppers, and garlic throughout your garden to keep monkeys back (they hate the smell). Or, plant thorny or prickly shrubs and bushes around the perimeter of your garden to physically block monkeys from entering it."

      "content": "Limit your interactions with monkeys to prevent an attack . A monkey may attack if it feels threatened or provoked, so avoid making direct eye contact with a monkey or teasing and antagonizing it in any way. Walk lightly (don’t run) around monkeys if you must pass them and do not try to cut between a mother monkey and her infant. [8] X Research source If a monkey does try to touch you, place an object like a board or backpack between you. Make loud noises or smack a branch against the ground to frighten it away."

      "title": "Use fully secured bins outside.",
      "content": "Use fully secured bins outside. Monkeys are attracted to residential areas if they think they can access food easily. Make sure you are not encouraging them to enter your neighborhood and check that there are no open or inadequately secured garbage bins outside your home which monkeys can gain easy access to. Use monkey-proof bins which can be properly secured and will not attract monkeys. You can secure bin lids with an elastic strap or bungee cord . [9] X Research source Tie all garbage bags with a double-knot and make sure that no food waste is left lying around or spilling out of the bins. Having easily accessible food in rubbish areas will encourage monkeys to move further into residential areas and even enter houses."

      "title": "Pick the fruit from your trees.",
      "content": "Pick the fruit from your trees. If you have fruit trees around your house or in your neighborhood, don't forget that these are a potential food source that could attract monkeys. Harvest any fruit trees as soon as possible in order to reduce the chances of monkeys finding the fruit. [10] X Research source If this is a consistent problem, consider whether you should continue to cultivate fruit trees. If you are growing vegetables in the ground, be sure to cover them with a strong wire mesh that is designed to resist primates."

      "title": "Don't feed the monkeys.",
      "content": "Don't feed the monkeys. After ensuring that food waste and rubbish areas are closed off and monkey-proofed, it is essential that you and your neighbors do not feed monkeys in the area. If the monkeys get fed, they will come back looking for more food. Cut off their access to human sources of food so they continue to forage in their natural habitat, not in urban areas. [11] X Research source Once monkeys know there is a food source, they are likely to visit every day."

      "title": "Monkey-proof all of the entrances to your property.",
      "content": "Monkey-proof all of the entrances to your property. It is also important not to make it easy for monkeys to enter your house to look for food. To do this, ensure that all windows are secured. You can simply close the windows, or monkey-proof them with a mesh covering . Meshing a window and keeping food out of sight will discourage curious monkeys. Also make sure that all pet entrances are closed and secured, if you have them."

      "title": "Avoid the use of plastic bags.",
      "content": "Avoid the use of plastic bags. If you have monkeys in the area, avoid using plastic bags as much as possible when you are walking around. Put any plastic bags inside canvas bags instead. Monkeys are curious and will snatch plastic bags to forage for food. They can easily tear through the plastic, so ensure they do not have the opportunity. [12] X Research source"

      "content": "Keep a fake snake or images of other predators outside. Monkeys fear snakes as predators or attackers, and studies have shown that just looking at pictures of snakes can make a monkey more pessimistic and risk-averse. [13] X Trustworthy Source Science Direct Online archive of peer-reviewed research on scientific, technical and medical topics Go to source So, some recommend keeping a fake snake (or several) outside near garbage bins, windows, roofs, boundary walls, or doors to scare monkey away without hurting it. [14] X Research source Some even slither and move automatically to appear more life-like. Some businesses have even found that large cardboard cutouts of predator animals (like large wild cats or aggressive, larger species of monkeys) can also scare monkeys away."

      "title": "Encourage neighbors to take anti-monkey precautions too.",
      "content": "Encourage neighbors to take anti-monkey precautions too. If you live in an area that borders the edge of a forest where monkeys live, it's important that you make sure your neighbors understand what to do to discourage monkeys from entering your residential area. If you secure your bins, close windows, and don't feed the monkeys, but your neighbors don’t, the problem won't be solved. Speak to your neighbors and explain how discouraging monkeys is the most effective way to deal with them. Education and awareness raising are essential for long-term solutions to be successful. You need everyone to buy in and take responsibility. [15] X Research source Contact your local town government or animal control agency if monkeys are consistently a problem in your neighborhood. They may be able to relocate the monkeys safely to a less bothersome area or help you install monkey deterrents near your home."
