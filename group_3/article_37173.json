If they have a relatively common name, you may also want additional information so you can distinguish them from others with similar names. It's also a good idea to have an approximate age range for the person, even if you don't know exactly how old they are. [2] X Research source Search on the internet to see if you can find any news reports related to their conviction. Those might give you more information about the person and the crime they were convicted of."

This website includes the sex offender registries for all 50 states, the District of Columbia, US territories, and Indian Country. [3] X Research source Your state or territory may also have its own website that you can search. However, the national site could potentially give you more information, since it will show if the person is listed on more than one registry."

      "content": "Report registry violations to the local registry office. Registry violations include not only failing to register but also participating in certain activities or being in certain areas. The specifics regarding what a registered sex offender is allowed to do vary depending on where they live and what crime they were convicted of. [5] X Research source For example, if the person was convicted of a sexual crime and their victim was under the age of 16, they may not be permitted to work around children. If they were working in a daycare, you could report that as a violation. You might also want to notify their employer and local law enforcement. You can also report a failure to register to the US Marshals Service by emailing iod.nsotc@usdoj.gov. However, keep in mind that violation of a state registration law is not necessarily violation of the federal registration law.

      "title": "Notify other authorities if the person failed to disclose their registration.",
      "content": "Notify other authorities if the person failed to disclose their registration. Some registered sex offenders are required to disclose their registration when applying for a lease, starting a new job, entering a school, and in other circumstances. The circumstances that require disclosure vary depending on the state where you live and the crime the person was convicted of. If you believe someone was required to disclose their registration and failed to do so, contact the person they were required to disclose to. For example, suppose you've learned that someone who lives in your apartment building is a registered sex offender. Your lease clearly states that registered sex offenders cannot live in your building. In that situation, you could talk to your property manager and let them know that the person is a registered sex offender."

Typically, you'll find details about this in the platform's help pages. [7] X Research source If you can't find the information in the help pages, use a contact form to contact the platform directly and ask if convicted sex offenders can have accounts on the site. As of 2020, states are constitutionally barred from enacting laws that ban sex offenders from using social media websites. [8] X Research source However, as private companies, the platform itself is free to restrict access to sex offenders."

[10] X Research source If the platform does not have a specific form for reporting a sex offender, use a blank contact form to report the person, providing the same information. Include any other information you may have about the person's activity on the platform. For example, if you have evidence that a convicted sex offender is trying to talk to teenaged girls through the platform, you might include that information."

Explain that you need help to report a convicted sex offender who is using a social media platform in violation of the platform's policies. [11] X Research source The officer you speak with may insist that there's nothing they can do because it's not against the law for the person to have social media accounts. Acknowledge that you understand that, then say that the platform recommended that you get local police involved if you couldn't complete the report on your own."
