Wait a bit to approach her and start off by listening more than you talk. Do not reveal your intention right away as this might be off-putting. Move slowly, at least at first. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Dress up . If you want a woman to notice you, you'll have to dress your best. Work on dressing up if you expect to see someone you're attracted to at a bar, party, or other event. Choose nice, flattering clothing. If you're worried your current wardrobe is too drab, go to a department store. You can ask a sales consultant to help you choose an outfit that's flattering for your body. Remember, it's sexy to be yourself . Strive to look your best on your own terms. That is, do not shave if you enjoy having a beard or dress in a suit where you're more of a button down guy. You won't feel comfortable if you're not behaving like yourself. This is something your date can easily sense and confidence is key to seduction. [2] X Research source Take a shower before you go out and consider using a bit of cologne. Too much could be overpowering, but a dab of a classy scent can help."

      "content": "Listen to her. When you approach a woman, try to listen. [3] X Expert Source Courtney Quinlan Matchmaker & Dating Coach Expert Interview. 27 August 2021. People tend to be attracted to those who seem interested in them. Rather than boasting about your own accomplishment and telling all your own stories, try listening instead. Try to ask more questions than you answer. Simple ice breaking questions are nice. Try things like \"What do you do for living?\" and \"Where did you grow up?\" [4] X Research source Always convey that you're listening. Smile , nod, and occasionally offer commentary like \"Uh-huh\" or \"Yeah.\" Ask follow up questions as well. Ask for clarification or further details on stories and personal information. Sexual attraction is tied to personality. Getting to know a person well can actually enhance your sexual feelings for that person. If you do end up successfully seducing a woman, you might enjoy the sexual encounter more if you know the person well. [5] X Research source Reader Poll: We asked 251 wikiHow readers to tell us which personality trait they find most attractive, and 50% of them said kindness . [Take Poll] When it comes to attraction, being genuinely nice can go a long way."

Try to proceed with confidence while you interact with the women you desire. [6] X Research source Remember, there's a fine line between confidence and egomania.

Make her laugh . Many people are attracted to people with a healthy sense of humor. Try to crack an appropriate joke during your encounter to see if you can impress her with your comedic side."

      "content": "Try an appropriate pick-up line. Pick-up lines have a bad rap. However, if you choose a pick-up line that's not overused or sleazy, it can actually highlight your charm and get a woman interested. Research on pick-up lines shows that this is a situation where highlighting your good qualities--that is, bragging a little--can help. Women respond less favorably to pick-up lines that are empty compliments or sexual in nature. They tend to be more interested in pick-up lines that allow them to learn something about a stranger that helps them stand out amongst other potential matches. [8] X Research source For example, if you're a nurse, you could try something like, \"Wow, this party is pretty lifeless, huh? As a nurse I think I'm pronouncing this DOA.\" Or, if you're a firefighter, you could try something like, \"Is it just me or is it hot in here? As a firefighter I think you might be the source of the fire here.\" If you want to choose a pick-up line, think of something clever that highlights an aspect of your own personality or life. Work in your occupation, if it's interesting, or some of your hobbies or positive qualities. Do not leave it at a pick-up line, however. Research indicates pick-up lines work best when they're followed by conversation. [9] X Research source"

      "content": "Use smell to your advantage. When you invite a woman over, a pleasant aroma is key to successful seduction. Try opening the windows for a few hours before she comes, letting any bad smells out. Light some incense . Choose a smell that's pleasant without being overpowering, like a light vanilla scent or something like sandalwood. Try to do a little research into what she likes beforehand. Try to work questions about smell into a conversation. Ask her about types of perfumes she likes or body washes to get a sense of the kind of smells she prefers. [10] X Research source"

      "content": "Try music. A little music can help get her in the mood . Remember, keep the focus on her and not you. Choose a type of music she'd like but also songs that are slow, soothing, and sensual. Ask her about her musical tastes beforehand. Try putting on a band she likes, but choose songs that are slower. Quicker pop tunes are more likely to put someone in a dancing mood than a sexual mood. Classic choices, like Barry White, run the risk of coming off as cheesy. Stick to somewhat non-traditional choices so your date won't end up rolling her eyes."

      "content": "Initiate touch . Initiate touch. When starting to initiate things, move slowly. Initiate touch by sitting close, placing your hand on her knee or shoulder. Seduction, once again, is all about pacing. Going too fast can be a turn off. The first kiss should be gentle, more than a peck but not full on making out. Leave her wanting more. Try to figure out her kissing style as well. How did she kiss back? That gives you a clue as to what she might enjoy. [11] X Research source If you're trying to seduce someone you've been with a long time, try to initiate things in unexpected places. People fall into routines in longterm relationships, which can get boring. Try making out , say, in the kitchen or hopping in the shower with your wife or girlfriend. [12] X Research source"

Not everyone's erogenous zones are the same, but certain areas of the body tend to be sensitive for many women. [13] X Research source The neck and ears have many nerve endings and are generally not touched during the day. They might respond well to kissing, sucking, licking, and gentle biting. The head and feet are major erogenous zones for many. A gentle scalp or foot massage might help get things moving. When kissing, focus on the lips. Try licking, biting, and sucking on the lips.
