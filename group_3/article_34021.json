      "content": "In the 7 days leading up to the meet, stick to your healthy habits. Now isn’t the time to try a brand-new work out routine and switch to a Keto diet. Sleep at the same time you normally do, go to work and/or school like you always do, and maintain any routines. Do things the same way you normally would to avoid throwing off your body or messing with your energy and comfort levels. [1] X Research source Maintain your normal practice and training regimen for the first 3-4 days of the week. Then, wind down and take it easy."

      "title": "Make sure that you know when and where to meet your team.",
      "content": "Make sure that you know when and where to meet your team. Ask your coach what time warm-ups are, what events you’re swimming, and whether or not the meet has positive check-in. Confirm the times, make sure your schedule is clear, and figure out how you’re getting to the swim meet. [2] X Research source Positive check-in is when you have to write your initials next to your name on a sign-in sheet. This lets the officials know that you are there and so they write out the heats so that there are no empty lanes. Your coaches should have a sheet with your events, although you may have an online schedule you can check."

      "title": "Make sure you have everything you’ll need for the meet.",
      "content": "Make sure you have everything you’ll need for the meet. This way, you won't be scrambling the next morning to gather your things and you can take it easy as you get ready. Pack your trunks, 2 pairs of goggles, 2 swim caps, a snack or two, and a change of clothes. [3] X Research source You might also pack a spare charger for your phone, a book, headphones, and any hygiene products you might need."

      "title": "The 2-3 days before the meet, engage in some self-care.",
      "content": "The 2-3 days before the meet, engage in some self-care . If you have school, do not rush between classes. Take your time walking up and down the stairs. Do not over-exert yourself so that you save your energy for the race. Take long baths, relax every night, and do something calming and enjoying for you. [4] X Research source This is especially important if it’s a multi-day swim meet. You really don’t want to exert yourself in the days leading up to a longer event. If you are going to work out at all, keep things very light and low-impact. Take a short jog, stretch, or do some yoga ."

      "title": "The day before the meet, load up so you have energy for the next day.",
      "content": "The day before the meet, load up so you have energy for the next day. Don't eat anything difficult to digest, excessively greasy, or completely out of the norm for you. The best plan is to eat something simple and easy to digest. Opt for some lean protein (like grilled chicken or salmon), healthy veggies, and a starchy carb, like potatoes, pasta, or rice. [5] X Research source Stay away from acidic foods (including tomato and tomato sauce), which can upset your stomach and cause cramps the next day."

      "title": "Aim to get 8-9 hours of sleep so you’re fully rested for the big day.",
      "content": "Aim to get 8-9 hours of sleep so you’re fully rested for the big day. You don’t need to change your sleep schedule or try to sleep for 12 hours or anything like that, but get some good rest ! If you don’t get a good night’s sleep the day before the competition, you will still be exhausted, which can have a negative impact on your performance. [6] X Research source If you tend to struggle to go to sleep the night before a big event, get up earlier than you normally do the day before the big meet. This way, you’ll be more tired than you normally are once it’s time for bed."

    {
      "title": "Consume something small and light in the morning before the meet.",
      "content": "Consume something small and light in the morning before the meet. You might have a small bowl of sugar-free cereal and a banana, or Greek yogurt with some nuts. Just like dinner, don’t eat anything radically different from what you would usually eat. If you normally eat two slices of toast with jam and marmalade and one egg, eat just that on the morning of your event. [7] X Research source If you're swimming in the afternoon, eat a healthy breakfast and a light lunch. If you are swimming in the morning, eat a light breakfast and eat a big lunch. Eat 1-2 hours before the event. Bananas, crackers, and plain toast with no butter are all great options."

      "title": "Listen to some good pump-up music and psych yourself up.",
      "content": "Listen to some good pump-up music and psych yourself up . Throw on some headphones and put on your favorite hype music. Alternatively, you might put on some calming music to get yourself into the zone and focus. Whatever it is that you do to build your energy up and get in the right state of mind, do it while you’re on your way to the event or gearing up for the swim meet. You might do some shadowboxing , use power poses, or read an inspirational book."

    {
      "title": "Drink plenty of liquids before the event and while you’re waiting to swim.",
      "content": "Drink plenty of liquids before the event and while you’re waiting to swim. Water is ideal, but you can also drink a sports drink that’s high in electrolytes. If you do drink a sports drink, stay away from the high sugar stuff. Drink plenty throughout the day and during the meet. A lack of liquids can negatively affect your performance, so stay hydrated ! [8] X Research source Just don’t forget to use the bathroom right before you get out there to swim."

      "title": "When you do arrive, check in with your coach and go to the locker room.",
      "content": "When you do arrive, check in with your coach and go to the locker room. Sign in and confirm the schedule so that you know how much time you have. Don't put your swim trunks on until after warm up and you are dry. Put your gear away, lock it up, and meet up with your coach and team to discuss what’s next. Put on sunscreen if you’re outside. Remember, it takes 30 minutes to soak in. You don't want goggle tans, that's for certain."

      "title": "Think through how you’ll handle mishaps and false starts.",
      "content": "Think through how you’ll handle mishaps and false starts. Create a mental map of how you’re going to respond to obstacles. Knowing how you’re going to react will help you stay calm in the heat of the moment. What will happen if my goggles fall off when I dive? Tighten the straps of your goggles. When you dive, tuck your chin to your neck. This way, the water will not apply direct pressure to the goggles. What if I come in last place? It happens. What you should know is that your coach entered you in the meet because they have faith and confidence that you can handle it. What if my time becomes worse? Give your races everything you've got. Every single ounce of energy left in you should show in that race. If you do come last, know that you tried hard and give yourself credit for that."

      "title": "Focus on the things that you can control versus the things you cannot control.",
      "content": "Focus on the things that you can control versus the things you cannot control. You can control your start and your turn; you cannot control the size or speed of your opponent. You can control what you eat before your race, you cannot control the conditions of the water in the pool. [9] X Research source"

      "title": "Picture yourself winning the race and swimming your absolute best.",
      "content": "Picture yourself winning the race and swimming your absolute best. Sit down somewhere quiet, and visualize the race from the moment you're up on the block to the moment you hit the wall. Visualize the exact time that you want to see on the time board. This will help you maintain a positive attitude and focus on your goals. [10] X Research source"

      "title": "Get in the pool and swim to get your muscles moving.",
      "content": "Get in the pool and swim to get your muscles moving. Don't tire yourself out by going too fast. Get in and stretch out and get a feel for the water. Do a few light laps. Do some kicking, sculling, or drills depending on whatever you prefer to do to get the blood flowing. [11] X Research source If you do feel the need to go fast, do a short hard set but don't go over 80 percent of your maximum speed. Make sure your intervals give you a good amount of rest. Wear two caps. If one comes off you will have another underneath. If you put one on, then goggles then another cap, your goggles are less likely to come off."
