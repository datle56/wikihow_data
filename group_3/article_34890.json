      "content": "Attach your mute to your violin. The mute should attach to the one or both of the two middle strings, D and A. It should attach between the tailpiece and the bridge, with the prongs facing the bridge. When you do not need to use the mute, leave it between the tailpiece and bridge. If it gets too close to the bridge, it will cause a rough, buzzing sound, so be sure to keep it away from the bridge."
