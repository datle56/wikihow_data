Also, discard any that have deformed primers, indicating excessive pressure during firing. [1] X Research source Rub the inside of the case with a soft cloth to remove powder residue and dirt. Reach into the case with a case neck brush. Lubricate the casings to keep them from getting stuck in the sizing die. Spread a light coating of case lubricant on a lube pad and roll several casings across the pad at once. Reapply lubricant to the pad as needed."

      "title": "Remove the spent primers.",
      "content": "Remove the spent primers. Insert each case into the loading press. The handle should be positioned up. Lower the handle to resize the case and push the fired primer out. Raise the handle back up, remove the case and place it in a reloading tray. Repeat this step for all the cases. Some presses have a rotating tray that allows you to load several at once. You'll still want to go through the process of de-capping all of the spent casings before you go loading any of them. It'll be tedious, but worth it in the end."

      "title": "Insert a new primer into the case.",
      "content": "Insert a new primer into the case. Raise the handle to its highest position and place a new primer into the cup of the primer arm. Insert a case into the shell holder. Push the primer arm into the ram slot and lower the case onto the primer. Remove the casing and inspect the primer. It should be flush or slightly lower than the case base."

    {
      "title": "Reload the casing with the correct powder.",
      "content": "Reload the casing with the correct powder. Each type of size of shell requires a different variety and weight of powder. It is recommended that you buy a respected loading handbook such as the Alliant Powder Reloader's Guide that covers the calibers you intend to load. Follow their recommendations regarding powder and weight. [2] X Research source Weigh out the correct amount of powder. You can weigh each charge individually or use a volumetric powder measure or calibrated dipper. Add the powder using a funnel. Discard or return unused powder to the factory container. If it's left on your measurement device or other equipment, the powder can damage it. Keep the reloading area clean and free of powder."

      "content": "Seat the bullet. The seating die pushes a bullet to the proper depth in the neck of the case and crimps the shell. Put one of your casings in the shell holder, lowering the press handle to crimp the casing, securing it in place with the lock ring. Consult the owner's manual for more guidance regarding crimping. [3] X Research source Hold a bullet over the open casing with one hand while you lower the press handle with the other. If the bullet needs to be seated deeper into the case, adjust the seater."

      "title": "Check your empty shells for reusable hulls.",
      "content": "Check your empty shells for reusable hulls. The only reusable component of the shotgun shell is the plastic shell itself, which is ejected from the shotgun after firing a round. To find reusable hulls, look for signs of wear around the mouth of the shell. They should be relatively uniform, rounded and intact plastic casings to reload. Hold potential reload hulls up to the light and examine the mouth of each for splits and substantial wear along the crimping. If it's too torn up, you won't be able to use it to properly crimp back down, resulting in a faulty shell. Generally, it's a good idea to throw away shells that have been stepped on or jammed with mud in some way. Shells that come from break-open shotguns that allow you to remove the empty shells directly from the gun are your safest bet. Put them directly into a box or bag to keep them, if you want to reload."

Pull the lever, and the uncapping pin will remove the spent cap from the empty shell, also resizing the casing to proper specifications. If the shell has warped some in transport, this step should round it back out some. [5] X Research source"

The safest way to make sure that you're reloading your shells to the proper specifications is to consult a trusty reload guide like the Alliant Guide. Included will be a rundown of powder weights, shot types, and primers used in all brands and varieties of shells. If you're planning on reloading regularly, it's essential to invest in one of these guides."

      "content": "Rotate the shell plate to load the shell with primer and powder. Each reloader will work differently, so you might check your owner's manual from your reloading press for a proper guide. Most reload guides call for Red Dot shotshell powder for use in reloading, of a varying amount.12 ga. shells are usually loaded with between 16 and 25 grains of powder. Most reloaders have a rotating plate that allows you to keep a load of each necessary \"ingredient\" queued up, allowing you to work relatively quickly. To advance between the steps, you simply rotate the plate and pull the handle again. You can go as quickly as you can do that simple action."

[6] X Research source You've got some choice in the matter when it comes to what shot you want to load your shells with, depending on your purposes. 12 gauge shells generally use size 7.5, 8, or 9 size shot, sold in big 25 pound bags. The smaller the number, the larger the little lead balls. If you're shooting for sport, 8 or 9 is generally better, while you might want size 7.5 if you're hunting or reloading for some other purpose."

      "content": "Crimp the shell. Rotate the reloader again to crimp the shells closed, securing the completed shell. Store them in shotshell trays, widely available at sporting goods stores or other outlets, or just put them back in the old boxes that the shells came in. If you've altered the shells in any way--using different sizes of shot or made other manual-approved modifications--make note of it on the box so you know what you're shooting."
