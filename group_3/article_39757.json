In many versions of the game, pocketing the 8-ball on the break guarantees the breaker an automatic victory. However, if you pocket the 8-ball on the break and scratch the cue ball, you will automatically forfeit the game to your opponent. [1] X Research source"

For a standard game of eight-ball pool, the 1-ball is placed at the rack’s apex and the 8-ball is located in the center of the triangle. One bottom corner must contain a solid and the other corner must contain a stripe—the numbers on these two balls do not matter. All other balls are randomly placed within the rack. Make sure the rack is tight--the balls should be close together."

      "content": "Locate the head string. The head string is a line that goes across the table, from side rail to side rail. The line connects the second diamonds on the head end and passes through the head spot, a point equidistant from both side rails. [3] X Research source Pool tables have four rails, or sides: a head rail, a foot rail, and two side rails. Pool tables are have two ends, the head end and the foot end. Pool tables have three strings, or imaginary lines: the head string, the center string, and the foot string. These lines are never drawn on the table. The head string is nearest the head rail. The area between the head rail and the head string is called the Kitchen. On the break, the cue ball may be placed anywhere within the kitchen or along the head string. The center string connects the pockets on the side rails. The foot string falls between the second diamond on the foot end. The foot string passes through the foot spot, a point that falls equidistant between the two side rails. The apex of the rack is placed on the foot string. Each end has three diamonds."

If these placements aren’t working for you, try moving the cue ball along the side rail or towards the center of the table. Remember, the placement of the cue ball isn’t wrong if it works for you. For a nine foot table, place the cue ball one ball’s width away from the side rail you will be breaking from and three ball’s width from the head string (into the kitchen). For an eight foot table, place the cue ball one ball’s width away from the side rail you will be breaking from and two and one half ball’s width from the head string (into the kitchen). For a seven foot table, place the cue ball one ball’s width away from the side rail you will be breaking from and two ball’s width from the head string (into the kitchen. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Apply english, or sidespin. To sink the eight ball on the break, you need to apply english, or sidespin, to the cue ball. This is an advanced technique that affects the curve and throw of the cue ball. Imagine a clock face on the side of the cue ball facing you. If you are breaking from the right rail, use low left english—hit the cue ball at approximately 7:00. If you are breaking from the left rail use low right english—hit the cue ball at approximately 5:00. Mastering english requires a lot of practice. It is important to be patient while you work on developing this skill. Some experts recommend hitting the cue ball at 6:00, while others suggest hitting the cue ball at 6:30 or 5:30. Avoid hitting the head ball—it will cause the 8-ball to go in the wrong direction."

      "title": "Hit the cue ball with a draw stroke.",
      "content": "Hit the cue ball with a draw stroke. The draw shot is ideal when applying lower right or left english. This stroke causes the cue ball to reverse its path back towards you after it hits a pool ball—in your case the second ball to the right or the left of the head ball. Keep your cue level, your grip loose, and follow through with the tip of the cue down. The amount of force required will vary from person to person. While professional players break at about 36 mph (58 km/h), it is possible to make the shot by breaking at half the speed. Experiment with different amounts of force and remember that what works for you may not work for other people. This is an advanced stroke. Practice, practice, practice and be patient! The follow through is what causes the cue ball to roll back to you."
