      "content": "Rinse away water spots and then dry your car thoroughly. If you notice water spots when they’re still fresh, you may be able to get rid of them with a quick rinse. Just be sure to dry your car thoroughly with a soft microfiber cloth for cars to prevent new spots from forming when the rinse water evaporates. [1] X Research source Some dealerships recommend washing and rinsing your car with deionized water, but this isn’t necessary if you dry the car’s paint finish thoroughly. There is some thought that blow-drying water spots with a hair dryer helps remove them. While this can help remove water spots on wood floors, there’s no evidence it works on car finishes."

      "content": "Use a 2-bucket method to wash your car. Giving your car a good wash using a 2-bucket car wash method removes most superficial water spots. With the 2-bucket method, fill 2 buckets with water. To wash a car by hand , mix a few squirts of a gentle car wash or baby shampoo in the first bucket. Use only clear water in the second bucket. With a sponge or car washing mitt , apply the soapy water to your car. Rinse and wring out the mitt or cloth in the bucket of plain water before saturating it with soapy water again. [2] X Research source Using a separate bucket of plain water to rinse your mitt or cloth prevents you from wiping the minerals from the water spots back on the car. This method also helps you avoid rubbing grit across your paint, which may scratch or dull the finish."

      "content": "They’re water drops that evaporate, leaving mineral deposits. Unless it’s distilled, water naturally contains tiny amounts of sediment and minerals like sodium, potassium, magnesium, calcium, chloride, bicarbonate, and sulfate ions. [10] X Research source Water can only hold a certain amount of minerals. As it evaporates, the mineral particles left behind form mineral solids that stick to the surface of your car. [11] X Research source When water has a high amount of minerals – over 7.5 grains per gallon (gpg) – it’s called hard water. Under 3 gpg is soft water because it has a low concentration of minerals. Hard water doesn’t pose any health risks. [12] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source However, the mineral buildup it leaves causes corrosion on appliances and, if you use it to wash your car, your paint finish. Most of the water in the US is classified as hard.

      "content": "The minerals in water spots chemically etch your car’s finish. When a water drop sits on your car, it starts evaporating, leaving the minerals behind on the finish. These minerals chemically etch into the clear coat, making small divots on its surface. As more water gets into these divots, it leaves more minerals that etch deeper into the paint. [14] X Research source If water spots are still on your car after you have tried washing and other DIY methods for removing them, they have done permanent damage. The good news is that it’s possible to remove permanent damage from water spots with wet-sanding and polishing (after making sure all of the minerals have been removed). [15] X Research source If the damage is bad enough, though, it may require repainting your car."
