      "title": "Pull the mouthpiece with your hand.",
      "content": "Pull the mouthpiece with your hand. If the mouthpiece is stuck, you can try to grip it with your hand and give it a little counter-clockwise twist. If it is not stuck too much, you will be able to pull it out with your hand."

      "title": "Tap at the mouthpipe with a wooden mallet.",
      "content": "Tap at the mouthpipe with a wooden mallet. Use a wooden mallet and give several little, fairly light taps around the mouthpipe (the insertion point where the mouthpiece goes in). This might help to loosen the connection between the mouthpiece and the instrument. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Tie a loop of rope around the mouthpiece.",
      "content": "Tie a loop of rope around the mouthpiece. Hold the instrument in one hand and hold the ends of the rope in your other hand. Give the rope a yank to see if the mouthpiece will come out. [2] X Research source You can also wrap something around the rope, such as a mallet or other object, that will give you more leverage in pulling on the rope to remove the mouthpiece. If the mouthpiece pops out, it might go flying across the room and hit the floor, putting it at risk for further damage."

      "title": "Place your instrument over a sink.",
      "content": "Place your instrument over a sink. You will need access to very hot running water. Have a towel ready as well, in case the water starts to drip over the instrument too much as you’re working."

    {
      "title": "Tie some ice cubes to the instrument with a wide rubber band.",
      "content": "Tie some ice cubes to the instrument with a wide rubber band. Using a wide rubber band, such as the kind that holds broccoli together, position ice cubes around the mouthpiece. They should touch the insertion point where the mouthpiece goes into the instrument. Let the ice cubes sit against your instrument for a few minutes to get the metal really cold."
    },
    {
      "title": "Start running very hot water over the mouthpipe.",
      "content": "Start running very hot water over the mouthpipe. Run the water as close to the mouthpiece insertion point as you can get without melting the ice. As the hot water hits the mouthpipe, it will start to expand the metal slightly, while the cooling effect from the ice cubes will contract the mouthpiece metal. Keep the hot water running for a few minutes. Don't get the hot water on the lacquered (brass colored) part of the lead pipe. This will cause the lacquer to tarnish or even come off altogether."

      "title": "Turn off the water and pull out the mouthpiece.",
      "content": "Turn off the water and pull out the mouthpiece. Take the instrument out of the sink. Wrap the rubber band around the mouthpiece as tightly as possible. Grab the mouthpiece firmly, using the rubber band as a sort of grip, and pull the mouthpiece out."

      "content": "Inspect the mouthpiece for damage. The mouthpiece end that inserts into your instrument should be round and clean. There should be no rust or other debris on it. Look for dents and an oval or squashed shape by holding the mouthpiece at eye level or comparing it to an undamaged mouthpiece."

      "content": "Use a mouthpiece trueing tool. If your mouthpiece is misshapen at all, use a trueing tool to return it to its correct shape. This tool looks like a skinny T and has a somewhat pointed end. To use, insert the tool into the end of your mouthpiece. Tap it very gently with a rubber mallet (not a hammer!). The tool will force the mouthpiece end to become rounded. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Buy or borrow a mouthpiece puller.",
      "content": "Buy or borrow a mouthpiece puller. A mouthpiece puller is a handy device that is solely intended to pull stuck mouthpieces out of brass instruments. They can be used for small and large instruments, so they are versatile enough to use on trumpets, trombones, tubas and so on. These are available online or in music stores. The most common mouthpiece pullers are: Bobcat Mouthpiece Puller: This is the least expensive, costing about $40. This one has two screws that need to be tightened simultaneously when using it. Ferree G88 Mouthpiece Puller: This is a more expensive option, costing about $100. It is bulkier, but it only has one T handle that needs to be screwed in when being used. DEG Magnum Mouthpiece Puller: This is usually the most expensive puller, costing about $130. It is very similar to the Ferree."

Alternately, you can do this on the floor, especially if you have a large instrument. You may want someone to help you by gently holding the instrument still while you operate the mouthpiece puller."

There are usually grooves or other U-shaped areas where your mouthpiece will fit into the puller. Read the manufacturer’s instructions to ensure you are using the mouthpiece puller correctly."

Depending on the type of puller you are using, tighten the screws (on the Bobcat mouthpiece puller) or the T handle (on the Ferree G88 mouthpiece puller). Turn the screws evenly, steadily and slowly. The mouthpiece should start to move out of the instrument."

      "content": "Remove the mouthpiece. Once the mouthpiece puller has loosened the mouthpiece, you should be able to gently twist and pull to get it free. It should come out smoothly. For mouthpieces that are really stuck, use a rubber mallet to tap the puller when it is tightened up. This might enable you to turn the screws a little more to help move the mouthpiece.
