[1] X Research source Use acrostics, [2] X Research source or silly sentences, which start with the first initial of each planet name, to help you remember the order, starting with Mercury and ending with Neptune (Pluto has been changed to a 'dwarf planet' so it doesn't count as an actual planet) (or just until Neptune, if that’s all you need to learn). Some examples are: [3] X Research source My Very Educated Mother Just Showed Us Nine My Very Elderly Mother Just Sat on Uncle Ned Mom Visits Every Monday, Just Stays Until Noon My Very Educated Mother Just Served Us Noodles Mustard Volcanoes Erupt Meaty Juicy Sandwiches Up North"

      "content": "Sing a song. Setting the names of the planets to a song may help you remember the order. There are a number of songs that help you recall a basic fact about each planet and help you remember their order. One example is “Planets Song,” which can be downloaded as an audio file from Amazon or iTunes [4] X Research source . Search online for other examples, downloadable music files and videos of other planet songs."

      "content": "Make up an acronym. An acronym is made up of the first initial of each planet’s name. [5] X Research source For the planets, an acronym would be: MVEMJSUN. This may be hard to remember until you make the acronym sound like a word by adding necessary vowels here and there. The acronym might sound like “Move-em-jason” if it were spoken out loud."

      "content": "Listen to an audio recording of yourself saying the planets. Many people are auditory learners, meaning that they retain information better when they hear it spoken out loud. Make an audio recording of yourself speaking the planets in order. Repeat it several times in the recording. Listen to this recording over and over. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Write down the planet names. For some people, it helps to write down information in order to lock it into their memories . Writing down the planet names in order over and over can be a useful way to remember the order. [7] X Research source It might help to use a different color marker to write each planet’s name. It might help you remember the names if they are associated with a particular color, especially if the colors are in rainbow order (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, purple)."

      "title": "Say the names in a chant.",
      "content": "Say the names in a chant. Saying the names in order over and over is another way to use repetition to remember the order. Chants are usually easier to remember when they are just a few words, and they do get more difficult when you have 8 or 9 planet names. But for some people, this is still an effective memorization method."

[8] X Research source Each number will be given a word that represents an object. For example, 1 will be given “bun,” 2 will be given “shoe,” 3 will be given “tree,” and so on. This method is particularly useful for a visual learner."

The linking method of memorization involves taking the names of the planets and working them into a story that will help you remember the proper order. [11] X Research source One such story is this: “Imagine the hot sun. What do you see coming out of the sun? A tube that contains MERCURY of course. Who gets covered by the Mercury as it falls? The goddess VENUS. What does Venus do to escape from the burning metal? She digs a hole and builds up a pile of EARTH. Who gets upset by the noise made by digging the hole? The little red-faced man (MARS is known as the red planet) eating a MARS bar. When he throws the MARS bar, who does it hit? It hits JUPITER the king of the gods. What has Jupiter got on his T-shirt? The letters S, U and N which stand for SATURN, URANUS, and NEPTUNE. Who is the little dog following the chap wearing the T-shirt? The little dog looks just like PLUTO.” [12] X Research source"
