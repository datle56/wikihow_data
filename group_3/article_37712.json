      "content": "It is possible to hack Roblox, but it's risky. Roblox can be hacked using exploits. Exploits are third-party programs or glitches that give the player an advantage over other players. While it is possible to hack Roblox, there are some risks involved. Hacking and using exploits goes against Roblox's terms of use and many exploits contain malware that is unsafe to download. Furthermore, many exploits only work temporarily until the game is updated and the exploit is patched out."

      "content": "Hacking is done using exploits. Exploits are third-party programs that inject code into the game. This may manipulate the player's speed, allow them to jump high or fly, walk through walls, and more. Most exploits work by loading a DLL file into the client that injects Lua scripts into the client. Some exploits are designed to work with specific games or game modes. These may give players more powerful advantages such as, God-mode, unlimited power-ups, cooldowns, and more. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Client-side exploits.",
      "content": "Client-side exploits. Client-side exploits manipulate code that is stored on the player's computer. When a player joins a server, the server loads data to the player's computer that allows the player to move, chat, and interact with the world. This data is the most easy to manipulate since it is stored on the player's computer. This is where most Roblox hacking takes place. Manipulating this data allows players to change their speed, jump high, teleport, and more."

    {
      "title": "Server-side exploits.",
      "content": "Server-side exploits. Server-side exploits manipulate code that is stored on the server. Since this data is stored on the server, it is much more secure and harder to manipulate. In recent years, Roblox has implemented anti-cheat systems that make this type of manipulation much more difficult. [2] X Research source Manipulating this data could theoretically allow you to have access to unlimited money or items, or inventory items. Most server-side exploits take advantage of bad security. Often, they will only work temporarily until the game is updated."

      "content": "Many exploits contain malware. Many exploits may contain keyloggers or spyware that can be used to steal your personal information. Exploits that claim to give you unlimited money are usually malware and don't do what they say. Exploits you see advertised through spam in Discord channels, Telegram servers, in YouTube videos, email or other platforms are probably malware."

This can be done using modified game files or using modified APK files to side-load a modified version of the game on Android. Mods for iOS also exist, but are much harder to come by and install.

If you choose to engage in Roblox hacking, do so at your own risk. Hacking Roblox may result in your account getting banned. You may even receive an IP ban, which prevents you from creating another account. Hacking creates an unpleasant experience for other players because it gives you an unfair advantage. When other players aren't happy, they're likely to report you. The risk of exposing your computer to viruses and malware is incredibly high. You could be putting your private information at risk or risking damage to your computer. Most legitimate exploits today are designed by people who are knowledgeable enough to bypass Roblox's anti-cheat system and are not free. [5] X Research source . [6] X Research source"
