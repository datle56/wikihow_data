      "title": "Get it out of the water immediately.",
      "content": "Get it out of the water immediately. Most modern phones have some water resistance. However, that doesn't mean they're completely waterproof. According to Bell, water seals on phones aren't as good as they say they are. The longer they sit submerged in water, the more likely it is that water will seep into your phone and reach the sensitive components. Water-resistant phones have ratings that begin with \"IP6,\" followed by the number 7 or 8 (e.g., IP67, IP68). The phone's IP rating represents how water-resistant the phone is. [1] X Research source IP67-rated phones can generally be submerged in up to one meter of water for 30 minutes without water making its way inside. Some phones that are rated IP67 are Google Pixel 2, iPhone X, iPhone 8, iPhone SE (2020), iPhone 7, and iPhone XR. IP68-rated phones can be submerged in up to 1.5 meters of water for up to 30 minutes. Some IP68-rated phones are iPhone XS, iPhone XS Max, iPhone 12 models, iPhone 11 models, Google Pixel 3 and later, Samsung Galaxy S7 and later, Galaxy Note8 and later, Sony Xperia 1 II, and LG Velvet. Salt water is more corrosive and damaging to a cell phone than regular water. If your phone is submerged in salt water, assume it has water damage, regardless of how long or how deep it was submerged."

      "title": "Turn your phone off immediately.",
      "content": "Turn your phone off immediately. Leaving it on can cause it to short-circuit. If it’s been in water, assume it is waterlogged whether it is still working or not. If the phone is plugged in while submerged, unplug the cable at the outlet! If you don't unplug it first, you could get a shock when removing it."

      "title": "Remove your phone's protective case and any other accessories.",
      "content": "Remove your phone's protective case and any other accessories. Quickly gather some lint-free cloths or paper towels, then lay your phone on top of them while you remove anything that's connected. Anything that remains connected to your wet phone can further trap water inside and/or become damaged."

      "title": "Remove the SIM card and battery (if possible).",
      "content": "Remove the SIM card and battery (if possible). If your phone has a removable battery, remove the battery cover and take out the battery. If the SIM and/or SD card is under the battery cover, remove it as well. If your phone has a SIM tray, pop it out and remove the SIM card. [2] X Research source Pat down your SIM card, memory card, and/or SIM tray with a dry paper towel or cloth, and then set it down to dry. These parts tend to not get water damage and can be kept for recovery. Some phones have water damage indicators that can tell you if water made its way inside. If you have a phone with a removable battery cover, you'll usually find a water damage indicator behind the battery, or on the battery itself. If your phone has a removable SIM tray, you may find an indicator on the tray. Look for a small white, pink, or red dot or square. If the dot is pink or red, that means the water damage indicator senses water has made its way into the phone."

      "content": "Wipe away water with a lint-free rag or towel. If you have a microfiber cloth, that will work best. In a pinch, a clean towel (even paper towels) will do. Use the cloth to remove as much moisture from your phone as possible, taking special care not to push any water into the charging port, headphone jack, or card slots. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Take your phone to a repair specialist. According to Bell, the best thing you can do after your phone gets wet is to take it to a reputable repair shop. They have special equipment that can treat water damage. They can disconnect the battery to prevent further electrical damage. They can also put your phone in a vacuum chamber that will boil and evaporate water at low temperatures that won't damage your phone. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Leave your phone in open air with a fan.",
      "content": "Leave your phone in open air with a fan. If you can't get your phone to a repair shop, place your phone on top of a dry towel or other absorbent surface, and position an electric fan to blow air across your phone’s surface. The more powerful the fan, the better. Leave the fan running (and the phone off) for 48-72 hours. [5] X Research source You can also position your phone so that the charging port is facing down. This will allow water to drain from the charging port."

      "title": "Use silica gel packets to dry out your phone.",
      "content": "Use silica gel packets to dry out your phone. Silica gel packets are designed to absorb moisture. If you happen to have a few packets on hand, place your phone in a ziplock bag with a handful of silica gel packs. Allow it to sit for up to 72 hours. You can buy silica gel online or at a store. They also come packaged with a variety of products, like shoes or beef jerky. However, speed is the most important element in saving your wet phone. If you don't have silica gel, simply place your phone in a dry, ventilated area. There’s no need to open the packets. Simply place them in the container with your phone."

      "content": "Do not use rice or kitty litter. It's a common myth that placing your phone in a bowl full of rice will absorb the moisture. However, studies have shown that rice is not very effective at removing moisture. Certainly not in the time needed to prevent water damage. Furthermore, rice and kitty litter can introduce dust particles that can be damaging to your phone. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Do not power on or charge your phone.",
      "content": "Do not power on or charge your phone. This may be one of the hardest parts of drying your phone. Any electricity can cause your phone to short-circuit, even if it seems like it works. Avoid the temptation to power your phone on or plug it in to charge until it is finished drying."

      "title": "Do not blow or use compressed air on your phone.",
      "content": "Do not blow or use compressed air on your phone. Blowing into the charging ports or using compressed air can push moisture further up inside your phone and make it hard for it to escape. According to Bell, once liquid gets past the water-resistant seals, those same seals will prevent the water from getting out."
