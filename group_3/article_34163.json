      "title": "Let scents and lotions dry before putting on gold-plated jewelry.",
      "content": "Let scents and lotions dry before putting on gold-plated jewelry. The chemicals in these kinds of products make gold plating fade over time, and the oils can gunk up a piece and make it lose its shininess. So when you get ready in the morning, put on your perfume, cologne, or lotion first, and let it dry for a few minutes. Once that’s done, accessorize! [1] X Research source If you use a lot of hand lotion throughout the day and wear gold-plated rings, try to remember to take the rings off before putting on the lotion."

      "content": "Keep plain pieces of gold-plated jewelry in resealable plastic bags. Air leads to tarnishing, so push the air out of the bag as you seal it closed. To keep items from getting tangled, use a separate bag for each piece of jewelry. [3] X Research source For added protection, slip a sheet of anti-tarnish paper into the bag along with the jewelry."

      "title": "Place anti-tarnish strips in along with your jewelry to prevent tarnishing.",
      "content": "Place anti-tarnish strips in along with your jewelry to prevent tarnishing. You can find these products online or from most jewelry stores.

      "content": "Soak your gem-free jewelry in warm, soapy water for 5 minutes. If your jewelry contains gemstones or pearls, skip to the last step in this section. To clean gem-free jewelry, fill a small bowl with water and swish around a few drops of mild dish soap. Then, gently lower your jewelry into the bowl and set a timer for 5 minutes.

      "content": "Scrub away grime with a soft, clean cloth. Tougher tools, like a bristled brush, will scratch the gold coating, which is the last thing you want! Simply rubbing the piece all over with the cloth should be enough to remove built-up oil and dirt. You can use a new, soft toothbrush to gently scrub the jewelry, if you'd like.

      "title": "Rinse the jewelry with clean water.",
      "content": "Rinse the jewelry with clean water. Either swish the jewelry through a bowl full of fresh water or carefully rinse it under running water in the sink. Check that all the suds are gone from any settings or crevices in the piece. [10] X Expert Source Edward Lewand Graduate Gemologist & Accredited Appraiser Expert Interview. 6 August 2020.

      "title": "Lay your jewelry on a soft, clean towel to dry.",
      "content": "Lay your jewelry on a soft, clean towel to dry. If you want, pat the piece dry with a clean towel to remove excess water. Then, let it finish air-drying on a clean towel. Try putting pieces with settings at an angle or upside down so that water can drain out of them. [12] X Research source Make sure the piece is completely dry before putting it away. Lingering moisture corrodes gold-plated jewelry and makes it tarnish quickly."

      "title": "Clean pieces with pearls and gemstones with a soft, dry cloth.",
      "content": "Clean pieces with pearls and gemstones with a soft, dry cloth. Don’t soak the pieces. Instead, wipe them down thoroughly to remove any dirt or grime. Once they’re clean, set them on a dampened cloth. Once the cloth is dry, you can put away the jewelry. [13] X Research source Pearls are porous and more prone to cracking if they get overly wet, which is why you should keep them away from water. You can also use cleaners made specifically for pearls if you’re dealing with an especially dirty piece."
