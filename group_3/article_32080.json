      "content": "Create a DIY packer using rolled-up socks. Position 1-3 rolled socks at the center of your crotch, then move them up or down to create the bulge you want. Wear tight briefs or boxer briefs to hold the socks in place. Use a safety pin to pin them to the center of your underwear and keep them from moving around. [1] X Research source Experiment with bulge size by choosing different-sized socks. For example, crew socks are bigger than ankle socks, so they'll likely create a bigger bulge. Use packing underwear to hold your DIY bulge in place. These are specifically designed for packing and come in all sizes and styles. DIY packers are very affordable, making them perfect for beginners and folks on a budget. However they may not work well in shorts, bathing suits, or clothes made from thin fabric."

      "content": "Wear a soft packer inside tight underwear or a jockstrap. A soft packer looks and feels like a flaccid penis and scrotum, giving you a very realistic bulge. It also helps with bottom dysphoria by allowing you to look down and see a penis in your underwear. [2] X Research source Soft packers come in many sizes and skin tones and work well in all kinds of clothing. You can buy them online: Ur basics offers a wide selection of soft packers ranging from $7-$58 (plus shipping). FTM Essentials has soft packers ranging from $16-$100 (plus shipping). They ship items in discreet packaging so that no one can tell what’s inside. The Emisil flaccid series packers cost between $300-600 (free shipping). These ultra-realistic packers come in many sizes and skin colors, and include options for pubic hair and circumcised or uncircumcised penises. [3] X Research source If you wear a jockstrap, you can wear loose-fitting boxers without worrying your packer will move out of place."

      "content": "Use a stand-to-pee (STP) packer to urinate standing up. STPs allow you to use urinals and urinate in toilets in gendered bathrooms without having to sit down. They’re also great for folks who experience bottom dysphoria when using the restroom. You can buy STPs from online trans-affirming retailers: [4] X Research source Transguy Supply offers a variety of STPs of different sizes, colors, and styles. Prices range from $15-$106 (plus shipping). If you don’t want to buy a separate STP packer, you can still urinate standing up using a pStyle ."

      "content": "Use a swimmer's jockstrap to pack under swimwear. A swimmer’s jockstrap is designed to be worn under a swimsuit or wetsuit. It’s made of water-resistant fabric, just like a swimsuit, and is designed to blend into swim trunks. This can help alleviate dysphoria caused during swimming since your bulge will be visible when your bathing suit sticks to you. [5] X Research source If you're going swimming, opt for a packer made from a non-absorbent material like silicone. If you’re using socks for a DIY packer, place them in a tight zip-up bag to keep them dry."

      "content": "Check your bulge in a mirror to make sure you like how it looks. Look at yourself face-on, from the size, and from the back. Then sit down in a chair or on the floor to see how it looks while you’re sitting. Move the packer up, down, left, or right until you find a position you like. [6] X Research source It may take several adjustments to get the bulge you want."

      "content": "Practice sitting, walking, and standing so your bulge feels comfortable. Your packer may feel uncomfortable when you first start wearing it. Give yourself time to get used to it. Start by wearing your packer for a short period of time, then gradually lengthen how long you wear it. [7] X Research source Wear it around your home first until you get used to wearing it, walking with it, and so on. Then wear it in public, if you want to. Remember that your gender identity is valid with or without a packer. You have a right to pack every day, occasionally, or never. It’s your decision."

      "title": "Choose a regular hard packer for a realistic bulge.",
      "content": "Choose a regular hard packer for a realistic bulge. Hard packers, a.k.a. “pack-and-plays,” are designed for penetrative sex. A regular hard packer is a strap-on dildo that resembles a real erect penis, complete with a scrotum. Some hard packers are extremely realistic and come in different sizes, skin colors, and with or without foreskin. [8] X Research source Regular hard packers aren’t ideal for daily use since they’re shaped like an erect penis. Their stiffness can make them uncomfortable and impractical to wear with clothes on. While you can choose any hard packer you want, it’s best to go with something close to the average penis size, 5 to 6.5 inches (13 to 17 cm). [9] X Research source The Emisil Erect Series costs $370-900 (free shipping). They’re quite expensive, but also super-realistic. They come in many sizes, skin colors, pubic hair colors (optional), and even in circumcised and uncircumcised varieties. [10] X Research source"

      "content": "Opt for a 3-in-1 packer to use for packing, urinating, and sex. A 3-in-1 is a multipurpose packer that allows you to soft pack, urinate standing up, and insert a special rod to make it erect, just like a dildo. 3-in-1s are great for packing when you plan to have sex later. “4-in-1s” and “5-in-1s” are specialized 3-in-1s with extra features to stimulate the wearer’s clitoris during sex and masturbation.One drawback is that they can be quite expensive. [11] X Research source urBasics sells “5-in-1” packers for $103-113 that provide extra stimulation for the wearer, in addition to allowing urination, penetration, and regular soft packing. Emile sells 3-in-1 packers for $370-$450 (free shipping). They’re made to be almost indistinguishable from a biological penis. FTM Shopping specializes exclusively in 3-in-1 packers . They cost $350-580 (free shipping) and can be customized to your specifications. Apart from the non-inclusive branding (not all AFAB trans folks identify as male, after all), these 3-in-1 packers are top-of-the-line. They look and feel like a real penis, and function as well as one."

Once you have the harness on, tighten or loosen the straps as necessary for a comfortable fit. [12] X Research source Purchase a harness online if you don’t have one for your dildo. Some websites may offer bundles allowing you to purchase a dildo and harness together."

[13] X Research source If you’re having a date night at home, you might enjoy showing off your erection through your pants. If you want to wear your dildo in public, try different positions for hiding your dildo to figure out which one is more comfortable for you. For example, your dildo may be less visible if you push it back between your legs or position it so it’s down against your thigh."

Feel free to reposition your packer while you’re out and about if you want to. Just as cis-men adjust their penises, you should adjust your own bulge as needed. [14] X Research source You can also excuse yourself to the restroom if you prefer to adjust your packer in private. It’s your choice."

Wash socks used in DIY packers with your regular laundry, Wash realistic soft packers and hard packers with soap and water, or follow the instructions provided by the manufacturer. Silicone packers can usually be sanitized in boiling water or thrown in the dishwasher, but double-check the cleaning instructions before you do so, just to be safe. Avoid leaving your packer unwashed for more than a day or two. Otherwise, it could get a bit smelly, like any used clothing item. [15] X Research source"

Avoid stuffing it in a drawer or closet to prevent it from getting bent, dented, or misshapen. [16] X Research source If the manufacturer provides a box for storage, keep your packer in that box when you’re not wearing or cleaning it."
