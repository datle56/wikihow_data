If the appraiser understands that your goal is to sell your jewelry (rather than, say, to get it insured), then they will be able to give you a more realistic idea of your jewelry's resale value."

You will be in a better position to get the best price for your diamonds if you can give potential buyers plenty of information about them. In addition to asking your appraiser for the resale value of the diamonds, try to find out about the following factors, which can affect the value and desirability of a diamond: [2] X Trustworthy Source Federal Trade Commission Website with up-to-date information for consumers from the Federal Trade Commisson Go to source Color: The Gemological Institute of America rates diamonds on a color scale from D (most colorless) to Z (highest color). In general, the more colorless the diamond, the higher its value (with the exception of “fancy color diamonds,” such as pink and blue diamonds).

      "content": "Get information about the setting. If you have a diamond or diamonds set in a piece of jewelry, this can also have an impact on the value and desirability of your diamonds. Find out what the setting is made of, what condition it is in, and (if possible) how old it is. If you have any information about your diamond jewelry already (e.g. where it came from, when it was purchased, how much you or whoever purchased it originally paid for it, or whether it has ever been reset), share it with your appraiser. This may help them understand your piece better and give them a better idea of its value."

      "content": "Get it in writing. Ask your appraiser for a written appraisal report and a sealed statement of value. The report should include a clear explanation of how the value of the piece was assessed, and should also describe the reason for the appraisal (since this will affect the assigned value of the piece)."

If you can't afford to hire an appraiser, or if you suspect your diamonds are worth less than $2000, you can get a ballpark estimate of your piece's value by going to a jeweler who buys or sells diamonds. [5] X Research source Take your diamond jewelry to two or three local fine jewelry stores so that you can get a range of opinions on the piece's value. A good jeweler should be able to give you at least a general idea of the quality and condition of your diamonds and their setting."

      "content": "Use the appraised value as a starting point. If you've had your diamonds appraised for resale value, you should have a good ballpark estimate of what they are worth. However, keep in mind that potential buyers of used diamond jewelry are probably looking for a good deal or hoping to make a profit by reselling or repurposing the gems. Understanding the resale value of your diamonds is more important than knowing their original retail value or the value of the raw materials. [6] X Research source Unfortunately, there is no simple formula for figuring out the fair market value (resale value) of diamond jewelry. There are many factors involved, including the quality of the diamonds, the overall condition of the jewelry, and the subjective appeal of the piece – i.e., is the piece fashionable and attractive? In general, you will probably have to settle on a price much lower than the retail value of your diamond jewelry. For example, most dealers who specialize in estate jewelry will pay around 10-20% of the current retail value for your jewelry. [7] X Research source"

[8] X Research source When searching for similar items, include information about the quality of the diamond (color, clarity, carat and cut), the type of setting (ring vs. necklace, etc.), and the material used for the setting (e.g. 14k yellow gold).

Set the absolute minimum price for which you are willing to part with your diamonds. For example, if you found similar pieces ranging in price from $399-$1000, you could set your minimum price around $400. If you decide to sell your piece on an auction site like eBay, you can set a reserve price (a hidden minimum price requirement) or sell for a fixed price."

Check out your potential buyer's Better Business Bureau ratings or find out if they are registered members of a gem society that promotes ethical practices (like the American Gem Society). [9] X Research source While selling your diamonds to a dealer is a quick and easy option, you are unlikely to get the best price this way. Jewelry dealers will want to resell your piece, and will probably need to pay less than market value in order to make a profit."

      "content": "Sell your diamonds through a consignment shop. Consignment dealers tend to offer better prices than other jewelry dealers. Rather than buying your diamonds from you, they will sell your piece for you and take a percentage of the sale price. So the higher the price they manage to get for you, the more money they make. Look for a consignment dealer who specializes in gems or estate jewelry. Make sure you find a dealer with good references and reviews. Selling through a consignment dealer usually involves handing your jewelry over to the dealer so that they can sell it for you, so you need to find someone you can trust. Most consignment dealers will take a 25-40% commission on whatever price they get for your diamond. [10] X Research source"

There are a number of options for selling your diamonds directly to public buyers online, including auction sites like eBay, general online classifieds sites like Craigslist, craft sites like Etsy, or specialist sites like I Do…Now I Don't. [11] X Research source Some sites will take a commission on the sale of your jewelry, or charge a small fee for listing your item. Make sure you review and understand each site's policies before deciding where to sell your diamonds. If you'd rather not sell your diamonds online, consider selling them through the classifieds section in your local newspaper."
