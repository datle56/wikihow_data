      "content": "A 22-inch (56 cm) bag gives you space for a week’s worth of clothes. Carry-ons work well for the summer months when you’re packing light clothes and only a few layers. [1] X Research source However, you might have to size up your suitcase for the winter months, since you’ll have bulkier clothes and more layers. For a 7-day trip in the winter, go up to a medium-sized suitcase, meaning a 24- to 27-inch (60-69 cm) bag. [2] X Research source Pick a softshell suitcase for a little more flexibility and space (especially if you’re planning on buying souvenirs). Choose a hard suitcase for more protection. Most airlines won’t require you to check a 22-inch (56 cm) bag on domestic flights, but international flights may require your carry-on to be 21-inches (53 cm) or less. Carry-ons are usually referred to by their height. For instance, a 22-inch (56 cm) bag is typically 22 inches (56 cm) tall, 14 inches (35.5 cm) wide, and 9 inches (23 cm) deep."

If you’ll be going out for a date night or attending a formal event, add in a nice shirt or dress, as well as your formal shoes.

Or, you might realize you can’t imagine wearing that wide-brimmed straw hat more than once on the trip. [5] X Research source Some “just in case” items are still important. For instance, don’t skimp on bringing raincoats and umbrellas if there’s a chance it’ll rain."

Rolling clothes into cylinders is a lot faster than folding, and rolling is also more compact.

This method’s best for synthetic materials like polyester and lycra, since those won’t wrinkle as easily as natural materials like cotton or linen. Fold up bulkier clothes and sweaters, especially items made from wool. [10] X Research source You should also fold (not roll) clothes that are prone to wrinkling, like dress shirts and linen clothes. [11] X Research source Feel free to combine this rolling method with using packing cubes. You can even put rolled clothes inside packing cubes to squeeze more into the cubes."

[21] X Research source Consider swapping your big camera out for your phone camera to reduce the number of cables and devices you have to bring. See if you can load up all your e-books onto your computer, tablet, or phone, rather than bringing an extra e-reader and its charger. In a pinch, use a bubble-wrap mailing envelope for a DIY laptop sleeve. Bring country-specific power outlet adapters if you’re traveling abroad. If any of your devices have lithium-ion batteries, you have to carry them on–you can’t check them due to flammability concerns."
