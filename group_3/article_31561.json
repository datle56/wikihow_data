      "title": "Familiarize yourself with the lock.",
      "content": "Familiarize yourself with the lock. A lock has three main components. The shackle is the U-shaped piece which attaches it to an object. The dial is the portion with numbers that turns. The body is the rest of the lock. If you hold the lock with the shackle on top and the dial facing you, typically the locking mechanism is on the left side of the shackle."
    },
    {
      "title": "Practice pressure.",
      "content": "Practice pressure. To find a lock combination you will need to pull up gently on the shackle. Too much pressure will make it impossible to turn the dial. Too little and the dial will spin freely. You should exert gentle pressure. This may take some practice."
    },
    {
      "title": "Find the first number.",
      "content": "Find the first number. Pull up gently on the shackle and hold it in place. Turn the dial clockwise listening carefully until you hear the lock click. Start with a good deal of pressure and gently let up as you spin it around, until you meet resistance in only one place. If the dial catches every few numbers, you are pulling too hard. If it never catches at all, you are not pulling enough. It should catch in only one place, making a click. If the click happens when the dial is between two numbers, round up to the higher number. Add 5 to that number and write it down. This is the first number in the combination."
    },
    {
      "title": "Set the first number of the combination as your starting point.",
      "content": "Set the first number of the combination as your starting point. It may be helpful to spin the dial a few times before doing this to reset the lock."
    },
    {
      "title": "Turn the dial counterclockwise to find the second number.",
      "content": "Turn the dial counterclockwise to find the second number. Maintaining gentle pressure on the shackle, turn the dial slowly. You should go all the way around the mechanism once before reaching the second number. The lock will bump and catch as you turn. Eventually the lock hit a point where it will be very difficult to turn. This stopping point is the second number. Note it on the same piece of paper."
    },
    {
      "title": "Try combinations.",
      "content": "Try combinations. One method of finding the third number is to simply test every possible combination. Set your first two numbers as if you were ready to unlock. Then turn the dial clockwise very slowly, testing each possible combination. At this point there should be only forty possible combinations. You do not have to reset the first two numbers for each combination. Simply turn one number then tug. Repeat the process until the lock opens."
    },
    {
      "title": "Test for the third number.",
      "content": "Test for the third number. A different method for finding the third number is to test the catch. Spin the dial clockwise a few times to reset the lock and set it at 0. Apply upwards pressure on the shackle and turn the dial clockwise. The lock will catch several times, allowing for slight movement back and forth between two numbers. Write down the number in the middle. For instance, if the lock catches between 33 and 35, write down 34 on a separate piece of paper. This is not necessarily the final number. The lock will also catch partway between numbers. For example, the range might be between 27.5 and 29.5. If the middle number is not a whole number, such as 28.5, do not write it down. Lock combinations are always whole numbers. Proceed all the way around the dial, writing down all the whole numbers where it catches. You should have four or five numbers written down. Most of the numbers will fit a pattern, for instance all ending in 5. The one number that does not fit the pattern is the final number in your combination. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Consider your lock.",
      "content": "Consider your lock. Recently made locks are designed to be shim-proof by the manufacturers, although in some cases it is still possible to pick them. This method will work better on older locks."

      "title": "Identify where the locking mechanism is.",
      "content": "Identify where the locking mechanism is. In order to use a shim properly you need to be working with the place where the shackle locks, as working on the hinge will not accomplish anything. Usually the locking mechanism is on the left side if you are looking at the lock with the shackle on top and the dial facing you."

      "content": "Cut an aluminum can. You can create a shim for yourself by cutting up a soda can. [2] X Research source Use scissors to cut off the top of the can, down the length and then to cut off the bottom. You should be left with a single piece of aluminum that was once the body of the can and is now a wide strip of metal."

      "content": "Cut a strip of metal. Turn the aluminum horizontally, so you are cutting the shorter side of the material. This piece will be used to make the shim. Cut a strip a little over one inch wide. If any of the edges are ragged, trim them. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Make two diagonal incisions. Cutting from the bottom of the metal around a quarter of an inch from the base of the U, cut diagonally upwards to intersect with the top of the U and remove the triangles of material. The result should be a strip of metal that looks something like the letter M, with the middle of the M curved instead of pointed. This will be the shim."

      "content": "Fold the sides to make a handle. Turn the top of the metal downward an eighth of an inch or so. Then fold the sides upward around the top of the strip of metal. Folding the sides allows you to have a handle on the shim that will not cut your hand with a sharp edge."

      "title": "Gently fold the shim around the shackle of the lock.",
      "content": "Gently fold the shim around the shackle of the lock. The U of the shim should face downward. You will want to wrap the shim carefully around the outside first so it molds to the shape of the shaft. When you have got the shape you want, turn the shim so the U is on the inner part of the shackle and your handle is on the outside of it. Remember to do this on the side of the shackle that has the locking mechanism."

Using your other hand, slowly work the shim into the crack between the shackle and the lock itself. It will take a few minutes and you should not rush or force it. When you have worked it in as far as it will go, stop."
