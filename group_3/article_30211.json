Then, either punch the tree trunk or use an axe to mine at least 3 wood block (also called logs) from the tree. [1] X Research source Hitting the tree without a weapon will take longer, so it’s probably worth crafting an axe if you plan to do a lot of building. If you already have a crafting table, you only need 1 block of wood for your armor stand and 2 to use as fuel for the furnace."

[2] X Research source Stone is very common, so you shouldn’t have much trouble finding it. You’ll need 8 cobblestone blocks to make a furnace and 3 cobblestone blocks to make the smooth stone block for your armor stand."

When the cobblestone blocks are finished smelting, they will be turned into regular stone blocks.

To put the armor back on, have empty hands, point your cursor at the armor stand, and click. If you want to move the armor stand after you place it, put moving water blocks or a piston behind it.
