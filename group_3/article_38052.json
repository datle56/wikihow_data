      "title": "Get a ripe spaghetti squash.",
      "content": "Get a ripe spaghetti squash. For the best seeds possible, pick a spaghetti squash that is firm and fairly heavy. When fully ripe, the squash should have a rich, yellow color; if it's green, it's not ready. If possible, avoid harvesting seeds from squash that are cracked or soft, since they may have been exposed to bacteria. [1] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Cut open the squash.",
      "content": "Cut open the squash. Open up the squash using a sharp, clean kitchen knife. Then, separate your squash into 2 halves, revealing a soft, stringy interior. [2] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Remove the seeds.",
      "content": "Remove the seeds. With a spoon, scoop out every bit of the stringy substance from inside the squash, then set it aside for later use. The stringy substance is made up of the fruit's seeds and the pulp connecting them together. When you're finished, the inside of the spaghetti squash should look completely smooth and uniform. [3] X Research source If you plan on cooking your squash, make sure to harvest the seeds before doing so."

      "title": "Place your seeds in a bucket of water.",
      "content": "Place your seeds in a bucket of water. Grab a bucket and fill it with a large amount of cool water. Set it in an area where it will not be disturbed, then drop your seed and pulp mixture inside. This will give your seeds a chance to both get clean and germinate."
    },
    {
      "title": "Let everything ferment until the mixture separates.",
      "content": "Let everything ferment until the mixture separates. In addition to simply cleaning everything up, the water will help you determine which seeds are worth keeping. Good seeds, ones that are still alive and rich with nutrients, will sink to the bottom of the water. Dead seeds, along with pulp, will rise to the top. Let the seeds sit until they are fully separated, which normally takes about 1 day. [4] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Discard the seeds and pulp on the surface of the water.",
      "content": "Discard the seeds and pulp on the surface of the water. Once they've had enough time to sit, carefully pour out the water so that the dead seeds and pulp escape while the healthy seeds remain in the bottom of the bucket. [5] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Rinse the good seeds off with cool water.",
      "content": "Rinse the good seeds off with cool water. To make sure the healthy seeds are as clean as possible, fill the bucket up with new, fresh water. Let the seeds soak for a few seconds, then pour the water out. Repeat this 3 or 4 times. Rinsing the seeds thoroughly will remove dirt and grime, preventing them from sticking to the drying sheet."

      "title": "Place your seeds on a drying sheet.",
      "content": "Place your seeds on a drying sheet. Once you've rinsed off your seeds, move them to a glass tray, a ceramic plate, or a sheet of flat newspaper. Spread the seeds out so that they each have ample room and are not touching the other seeds. [6] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Let your seeds sit in a dark place until they are completely dry.",
      "content": "Let your seeds sit in a dark place until they are completely dry. Put your seed tray in a dark area, like a basement or closet, and let them sit until fully dry. If you do not have access to a dark area large enough for your seeds, cover them with multiple sheets of newspaper. Your seeds should be completely dry after 2 or 3 days. [7] X Research source"

      "title": "Check on your seeds twice a day.",
      "content": "Check on your seeds twice a day. While checking your seeds, look out for any that may be rotting or decaying and remove them from the tray. Make sure to clean off any pooling water and, if necessary, remove wet and soiled newspaper."

      "title": "Remove excess pulp if necessary.",
      "content": "Remove excess pulp if necessary. Once your seeds are completely dry, you may find that there is still a small amount of pulp left on them. To get rid of it, simply peel they excess pulp off the seeds and dispose of it."

      "title": "Wrap your seeds in paper.",
      "content": "Wrap your seeds in paper. To keep your seeds contained, place them inside a small paper envelope or wrap them in a dry paper towel. This is especially important if you plan to store different types of seeds in the same container. After placing your seeds inside, examine the paper to see if any moisture appeared. If some did, give the seeds another day to dry, that way you don't encourage mold or mildew growth. [8] X Research source"

      "title": "Seal your seeds inside a jar.",
      "content": "Seal your seeds inside a jar. Get a solid glass container, like a mason jar, and wash it with antibacterial soap. Rinse out all the soap and dry the jar. Once the jar is completely dry, place your paper packet of seeds inside. Cover the container with a lid and make sure to close it tight, thereby keeping as much bacteria out as possible.

      "content": "Label the jar. To avoid mixing the seeds up with other strains, and so you remember when the seeds were cultivated, label the jar in clear, legible handwriting.
