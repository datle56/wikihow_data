      "content": "Replace the cotton balls as needed. You will probably need to use at least three cotton balls to take the nail polish off of your nails. However, you might need more, depending on the amount of nail polish on your fingernails. You should get a new cotton ball if the cotton gets caked with your old polish, starts to dry, or if it drags on the surface of your acrylic."

      "content": "Get a 150 or 180 grit nail file. You will need a nail file that has enough texture to file off the gel polish. Using a 150 or 180 grit file should be enough. You can fine this type of file in a beauty supply store. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Move the file in one direction over the nail polish.",
      "content": "Move the file in one direction over the nail polish. While holding the nail file in one hand, press the file onto the surface of one of your nails. Then, begin to move the file in swift strokes going in one direction. As you do this, you should start to see the nail polish come off of your nails. [2] X Research source Make sure that you move the file over different parts of the nail as you file. Do not focus on just one area. This is important to avoid generating heat over one part of the nail due to friction caused by the file."

      "title": "Continue to file each nail until the gel polish is gone.",
      "content": "Continue to file each nail until the gel polish is gone. After you finish removing the gel polish from your first nail, move to the second one. Then, continue to file each nail until you have filed the polish off of each of them. This will take a while, so you might want to do it while listening to a podcast, chatting with a friend, or watching a TV show."
