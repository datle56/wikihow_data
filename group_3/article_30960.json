Install the Roku app on your phone if you haven't already. Create a hotspot on a different device (NOT the one with the Roku app installed) that has the same name as the last network your Roku connected to. To find the name, go to Settings > Network . If you don't know the password for the original Wi-Fi network, you might be able to make it work by leaving it blank. Restart your Roku TV or streaming device, and it will connect to the hotspot. Connect your phone (the one with the Roku app) to the hotspot you created on the other device and open the Roku app on your phone. Select your Roku using the remote on your phone. You can now navigate the menus to set up your new Roku remote without Wi-Fi ."
