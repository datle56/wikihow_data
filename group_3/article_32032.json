Make sure the cable is firmly attached to your TV and console, and make sure that there isn't a lot of wiggle in the port. [1] X Research source If the cable looks damaged, try another HDMI cable. You also want to make sure that you're using the same input channel as the port on the PS4 to which you're connected."
