Fold the right corner over to meet the left corner. Crease well, then unfold. [1] X Research source You can find a range of origami paper on Amazon . When you start, the outside of the paper should face you. Note that \"pureland\" refers to a type of origami that only uses basic mountain and valley folds."

Fold the top left edge in the same way so that it meets at the center crease. [2] X Research source Note that a \"valley fold\" refers to a type of origami fold in which you fold the edge in your hand in, toward you, rather than folding it out and away from you."

Crease well, then unfold. [3] X Research source For this step, you should only crease the center of this fold and not the entire length. The center of your creased portion should intersect with the first pre-crease you created in an earlier step. When done, turn the paper over so that the inside side faces you."

Also note that a mountain fold is the opposite of a valley fold: fold the edges outward, creating a mountain-like peak along the fold itself. [9] X Research source Note the distinguishable downward pointing triangle at the bottom of the model. Valley fold this piece in half vertically. Mountain fold the top part of the model in half vertically. Valley fold the top two diagonal pre-creases and the bottom two diagonal creases.
