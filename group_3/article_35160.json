      "content": "Human design is a self-exploration system that combines ancient and modern beliefs. Human design draws on traditions like the I-Ching , the kabbalah, the chakra system , and astrology to help you understand what makes you unique. You can use this system to explore your personality and psychology, and the overall goal is to provide you with the tools to help you live your best life. Though human design isn’t based on science or studies, it is founded on ancient and respected traditions. If your bodygraph fits you well, that’s great! If it doesn’t, then there’s no need to stress. At the end of the day, you define yourself. You might also hear human design referred to as the Science of Differentiation, the New Astrology, or the Science of The Aura."

      "content": "A human design chart is a blueprint of who you were born to be. As a system, human design is probably most similar to astrology since the chart is generated based on your birth information (similar to a natal chart in astrology ). The chart, also known as a bodygraph, reveals information about your personality, natural tendencies, and energetic aura. You can use it to help you recognize and embrace your innate gifts. [1] X Research source Your human design chart will include information you’d normally find through personality tests like Enneagram and Myers-Briggs , but it delves much deeper since it includes the astrological side of things, as well."

      "content": "Energy type This is the foundational element of your chart. There are 5 energy types that define energetic auras: Manifestor, Generator, Manifesting Generator, Projector, and Reflector.

Understanding your energy type will teach you a lot about your innate qualities and help to put your other chart elements into perspective. Manifestor: Your bold and spontaneous energy makes you a trailblazer. You're an innovator who loves to make things happen. Generator: Your energy is uplifting and this draws people to you. You stay busy and seek out things that excite you. Manifesting Generator: You're a blend of Manifestor and Generator energies, so you're an innovator with boundless energy. Projector: You see the world in a unique way, which draws people to you. You're an analyzer with a gift for seeing patterns in the world around you. Reflector: Your energy is empathetic and intuitive. You're a sensitive and ever-changing chameleon who reads people and situations with ease. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Strategy",
      "content": "Strategy Each energy type is linked to a corresponding strategy. Strategy tells you how to most efficiently use your energy in your daily life. Following your strategy allows you to use your aura correctly and can have a significant impact on your life. The Manifestor’s strategy is to inform. Since your energy is bold and spontaneous, you forge ahead with creative plans. But, you don't keep others in the loop. Instead of going at it alone, explain your intentions before you act. You're a born leader , so others will assist you. The Generator's strategy is to respond. Your boundless energy is magnetic, but sometimes you're too busy to notice new people and opportunities. Slow down and respond to the things you attract. You don't need to chase after them—they'll come to you! The Manifesting Generator's strategy is to visualize and inform. Your boldness is a force of nature. You forge ahead when inspired (which is often), and you stay busy. This causes you to miss amazing, new opportunities. Slow down so you can respond and react to good things in your life. The Projector's strategy is to wait for recognition and invitation. You're a great leader, but sometimes you push yourself (and others) beyond capacity. This can create friction. Take a step back and let others appreciate your work. When they inevitably invite you to do more, seize the opportunity. The Reflector strategy is openness. You reflect energies around you, which makes you naturally sensitive and ever-changing. It's your gift! Don't try to mask it so others feel more comfortable. Embrace your open nature and give yourself permission to chase life's mysteries—don't worry about what others think."

      "content": "Not-self theme Each energy type is connected to a specific not-self theme, which reflects the negative emotion(s) your energy type feels when you aren’t using your energy effectively. If you notice yourself feeling these emotions, it's a sign that you need to embrace your specific strategy to make changes in your daily life. Generator: Frustration Manifestor: Anger Manifestor Generator: Frustration + Anger = Impatience Projector: Bitterness Reflector: Disappointment"

      "content": "Inner authority Your inner authority is your intuitive way of knowing if a decision is the right one for you. Think of it as your personal compass that you can consult to help you make decisions like where to live, what career path to follow, which relationships to develop, and so on. The main inner authorities are: [4] X Research source Emotional: Trust your feelings to help you make decisions. Sacral: Listen to your inner voice to make decisions. Splenic: Use your intuition to help you make decisions. Ego: Fall back on your willpower to help you make decisions. Self-projected: Reflect on who you truly are before making decisions."

      "content": "Energy centers Each energy center is a hub that corresponds to certain functions. On the chart, energy centers are represented by geometric shapes that are shaded in with color (colors vary by chart) or white. If an energy center is shaded in with color, that means you connect strongly with that center; it’s fixed and reliable. If the center is white, it means you don’t naturally connect to this area (meaning you’re more vulnerable there). Think of these as your natural strengths and weaknesses.

Your profile will consist of two numbers (ex: 5/1, 1/3, etc.) The first number represents the part of you that you're more aware of, and the second number reflects how others see you (so you may be less aware of these qualities). Work on embracing the second number while honoring the first. (1) The Investigator: You love to study deeply and research things. (2) The Hermit: You tend to hold back and wait for the right opportunity. (3) The Martyr: You learn by trial and error. (4) The Opportunist: You network and leverage your relationships.
