      "content": "Go to a reputable fish market that handles the salmon safely. To ensure that your salmon is fresh and safe to eat raw, you need to find a market that treats the fish properly. Check to see if the salmon fillets are displayed in aluminum trays with plenty of crushed ice surrounding them. Whole salmon, on the other hand, should be completely buried in ice. [1] X Research source Salmon fillets should be arranged so that their flesh touches as little of the other fillets’ flesh as possible. The staff at the store should cut the salmon fillets in full view of customers. Make sure that the cutting boards are cleaned and sanitized regularly."

      "title": "Choose farmed salmon to avoid parasites.",
      "content": "Choose farmed salmon to avoid parasites. To be completely sure that there are no parasites in your sushi, it’s best to avoid wild salmon. Farmed salmon are fed parasite-free food, so you can be certain that the fish is safe. [2] X Research source Farmed salmon is usually labeled as such, but if you aren't sure, ask a fish market worker whether it comes from a farm or the wild."

      "content": "Buy whole salmon to make it easier to judge the freshness. While salmon fillets are easier to work with, freshness is usually more apparent with whole salmon. You'll be able to choose the freshest fish if you choose whole salmon. [3] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Study the fish's eyes and flesh to determine freshness.",
      "content": "Study the fish's eyes and flesh to determine freshness. With whole salmon, make sure the fish’s gills are bright red, its eyes are clear and bulging, and the flesh is clear and firm. With salmon fillets, look for bright pink or orange flesh and fine white lines running through it. [4] X Research source Whole salmon should also have a clean marine smell and tight muscles. If a whole salmon's eyes appear cloudy and/or sunken, the fish likely isn't fresh. A milky film on the exterior of the fish is another sign that the salmon may be bad. If the salmon fillets have a dull gray or yellowish color, they've probably gone bad."

      "title": "Scale and gut the salmon",
      "content": "Scale and gut the salmon yourself to be safe. Scaling and gutting can be a lot of work, especially if you’re not used to it, but if you aren't sure how clean and reputable the fish market is, you may want to take care of cleaning the fish yourself. You’ll need a fish scaler, fish tweezers, and a boning knife to handle the job. [5] X Research source If you clean and gut the fish yourself, make sure to wash all of the blood and guts out of the fish with running water. If you trust the fish market, it’s fine to ask them to clean and gut the fish."

      "content": "Sanitize your work surface with a bleach solution. Before you begin filleting or cutting the salmon, it’s important to ensure that your work area isn’t dirty or covered with germs. Wipe down your counter or cutting board with a solution of 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of bleach mixed into a gallon (3.7 liters) of water. Allow the solution to sit on the surface for 30 seconds before wiping it dry. [6] X Research source"

Sanitize the knifes by filling a spray bottle with cool water and then remove the spray nozzle. Dip it approximately three-quarters of the way in bleach, return it to the bottle, and shake well to mix the bleach and water. Repeat the process two more times, and the spray the knives with the solution. Let it sit on the blades for 10 minutes. [7] X Research source"

Wash your hands with antibacterial hand soap and dry them well as the last step of your preparation before handling the fish as well.

[10] X Research source Next, take a large butcher knife, and insert it into the salmon just behind the head. Cut along the spine with an in and out saw-like motion until you cut all the way to the end of the fish. Tilt the knife downward slightly toward the spine, so you’ll get the most meat off of the salmon as possible. While you’re cutting, it helps to lift the flap of belly meat out of the way. This makes sawing along the spine a little easier because it provides better access and gives you some leverage."

Cut the second fillet in the exact same way as you did the first, sawing the knife along the spine until you reach the back of the head.

Keep the knife as close to the ribs as possible so you don’t remove any more more meat than is necessary. [11] X Research source To be sure that you've removed all the ribs, run your fingers along the fish to see if you can feel any that you've missed. You can also scrape your knife along the fish to check for missed ribs."
