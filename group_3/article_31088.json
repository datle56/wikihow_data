They're truly dedicated to the people they're close to. So when you go to someone else for love and support, Cancer will take this personally. Then, they'll start to overthink: Um...why didn't they come to me for help? Jealousy is sure to follow! Be careful with your words to keep Cancer cool. Call someone \"a great listener\" and Cancer may hear \"a way better listener than you. \" Luckily, apologies work well with this water sign. If Cancer's jealous, tell them you’re sorry . Then, sweeten the deal with a compliment or two. Cancer is likely to be passive aggressive when they're hurting—if they go quiet, ask them directly about what's bothering them."
