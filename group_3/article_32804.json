      "title": "Pisces is represented by the fish.",
      "content": "Pisces is represented by the fish. Pisces’ official zodiac symbol is 2 fish swimming in opposite directions. Psychic astrologer Stina Garbis says fish represent this sign because “Pisces takes on the emotional characteristics of the water since they are a water sign.” Like the waters fish swim in, Pisceans “are really clear and transparent when it comes to their emotions.” Fish are also associated with mystery and the unconscious, which mirrors a Pisces’ “rich fantasy life” and their “very creative, intuitive, and artistic” personality. The 2 fishes also represent Pisces’ dual nature . Pisces is simultaneously dreamy and imaginative and grounded and compassionate. So, they can be conflicted by their idealistic outlook and reality. Garbis says, “The Greek myth behind [Pisces' relationship to fish] is that Aphrodite and her son Eros transform themselves into fishes to avoid the monster Typhon.”"
