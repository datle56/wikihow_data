      "content": "Purchase qualifying menu items at McDonalds to obtain game pieces. The game pieces are basically stickers that you peel off the food's packaging. Most qualifying items are worth 2-3 game pieces apiece. The qualifying items are different in each country and change every year, but you should be able to get a list in-store at McDonald's or on their website. Items with 2 stickers are called “Double Labels” and items with 3 stickers are called “Triple Labels.” [1] X Research source Keep in mind that game pieces are only available during game time. Pieces from previous years are not eligible."

      "content": "Mail in a request to get free game pieces without buying any food. McDonald's offers Monopoly as a \"no purchase necessary\" game in most countries. Get the mail-in address online or off the game board and copy it onto a large envelope. Write your return address at the top left of the envelope. Then, grab a second envelope and address it to yourself. Put a stamp on this envelope so the postage is paid for. Place this empty, self-addressed stamped envelope (SASE) into the larger envelope addressed to McDonald's. Add a brief handwritten note that states you want free game pieces and mail everything off. McDonald's will use the empty envelope you included to mail you 2 game pieces. [2] X Research source You aren't allowed to send more than 2 requests per week. The return address on your outer envelope must match the recipient's address on your SASE (self-addressed stamped envelope). The address can change from year to year and varies by country. To get this year’s address, check McDonald’s website at https://www.mcdonalds.com/ . Keep in mind that due to the coronavirus, the 2020 game has been cancelled or postponed in most countries."

      "content": "Get a game board in-store or access the game board online. The game board basically looks like a regular Monopoly board. It shows all of the properties and their names so you can keep track of your property game pieces. The game board also tells the prizes for each corresponding set of property pieces. [3] X Research source The game board isn't essential—your pieces are still valid if you don't have one—but makes it easier to keep track of your stickers. You might want to keep a physical copy or save it as a digital file for reference."

Grab the edge of the sticker label where it says “Peel Here” and pull the label right off the packaging. Flip the sticker over to see what kind of piece(s) you have. [6] X Research source If you got game pieces through the mail, you won't have to peel them off any food packaging—the pieces will be ready to use. Most items are worth 2-3 game pieces. There are perforations between individual stickers so that you can easily separate them. There are 3 possible types of game pieces: Instant Win, Online Prizes, and Property Sets.

For example, you could enter your codes at 2 am and see what happens. [9] X Research source According to McDonald's official rules, you must use the URL printed on your game piece. The URL varies depending on the year and what country you're in. There's no live URL unless the game is active. [10] X Research source"
