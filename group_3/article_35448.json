      "title": "Keep the key out of the ignition and turn all electronics off.",
      "content": "Keep the key out of the ignition and turn all electronics off. Set your headlights, dome light, and other electronics to “off.” Otherwise, a power surge may occur when you reconnect the battery, possibly damaging the car’s electrical system. If your car has a start button and keyless ignition system, unlock all doors and keep the keyfob away from the vehicle to prevent the electronics from starting. [1] X Research source In many vehicles, the electronics will automatically turn on if the key is inserted into the ignition, or if the keyfob is within a certain distance of the car. Manually unlock all the doors to avoid getting locked out. Your power locks may not work until the battery is reconnected."

      "title": "Slide the positive battery cable onto the positive terminal.",
      "content": "Slide the positive battery cable onto the positive terminal. The positive cable will have a circular red connector, while the positive battery terminal (also called a battery post) is labeled with a “+” sign and may also be marked in red. The red connector slides onto the positive battery terminal like a ring sliding onto a pole. Slide the connector onto the terminal with your hand until the connector lies flat against the battery. [2] X Research source Wear rubber gloves to avoid electric shocks, and never touch both terminals at the same time. If the connector won't slip over the terminal post, use a wrench to loosen the bolt on the connector so that it fits around the post."

    {
      "title": "Use a wrench to tighten the connector onto the post.",
      "content": "Use a wrench to tighten the connector onto the post. Locate the bolt on the flap of metal attached to the circular red connector. Turn the bolt clockwise to tighten the connector and secure it to the battery post. Keep tightening until the connector is firmly clamped and doesn’t move easily. This will prevent the connector from coming loose due to vibrations from driving. [3] X Research source Wiggle the wire on the terminal a bit with your hand to make sure it's secure. If it moves at all, tighten the connector further. If the battery’s design makes using a socket wrench difficult, use an open-ended wrench instead."

    {
      "title": "Connect the negative cable to the other post and tighten it in place.",
      "content": "Connect the negative cable to the other post and tighten it in place. The negative cable has a black circular connector, while the negative battery post is labeled with a “-” sign and is sometimes marked in black. Slide the black circular connector onto the negative battery post, just as you did for the other post. Use your wrench to tighten the connector until it no longer moves easily. [4] X Research source If either cable can't reach the appropriate terminal, your battery may not be oriented correctly. If this occurs, disconnect the cables, remove the hold-down mechanism, and remove the battery. Then install the battery again in an orientation that allows the cables to reach the terminals."

      "title": "Insert the key into the ignition and start the car.",
      "content": "Insert the key into the ignition and start the car. With the battery connected, the dome light should come on when you open the driver's side door, or when the keyfob comes close to the car. Insert the key into the ignition and turn it to start the vehicle, or press “Start” if your car has a keyless ignition system. The vehicle should start and run normally. [5] X Research source If the vehicle does not start, check the connections at the battery, the alternator, and the location where the negative cable touches the body. If any connections have come loose, attach them and try again. If all connections are in place, try starting the car a few more times. If your car still won’t start, the battery may be dead. Try jump-starting the car to charge the battery, or take your vehicle to a mechanic to check for electrical problems."

      "content": "Scrub and remove any rust or debris from the battery cables. Spread more baking soda/water paste onto your wire brush, then scrub the metal connectors at the end of the cables. Remove all rust or buildup to ensure electricity flows freely when the connectors are reattached to the battery terminals. Use a damp rag to remove the paste when you finish. [9] X Research source If the outer surfaces of your wire connectors are painted, leave the paint intact and scrub the inside of the connectors to remove debris."

      "title": "Apply anti-corrosion spray to the battery posts and connectors.",
      "content": "Apply anti-corrosion spray to the battery posts and connectors. Apply plenty of spray to prevent rust or debris from accumulating again in the future. Spray both the positive (+) and negative (-) terminals of the battery, as well as the inside of the wire connectors. Use a clean rag to wipe off excess spray. [10] X Research source Choose an electrically conductive corrosion protection spray designed for car batteries. You can also buy corrosion protection cream , instead of spray. Use a clean rag to apply the cream to avoid electric shocks."
