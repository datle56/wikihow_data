      "content": "Use positive self-talk to motivate yourself to live better. [1] X Expert Source Sheila A. Anderson Certified Image Consultant & International Branding Icon Expert Interview. 19 July 2021 You likely have a negative voice in your head that sometimes criticizes your looks, intelligence, talents, or accomplishments. Ironically, this critical voice is often trying to protect you from embarrassment and heartache by convincing you to play it safe, even if that holds you back from your dreams. If you listen to this negative voice, you'll likely end up with low standards for yourself because you'll be too afraid of failure to go after what you want. Instead, replace this negative voice with positive self-talk by telling yourself you’re strong, capable, and totally amazing. [2] X Research source You might tell yourself things like, “I can do anything I set my mind to,” “It’s okay to make mistakes as long as I learn from them,” or “I'm worthy of love.” It's okay if you slip back into negative self-talk sometimes. Gently remind yourself to use your positive self-talk and try to do better moving forward."

Additionally, feeling exhausted makes it harder for you to make healthy choices, like choosing baby carrots for a snack instead of candy. Set a bedtime for yourself that allows you to get 7 to 9 hours of sleep every night. Spend 30 minutes to an hour before bed winding down with relaxing activities like reading, bathing, or listening to calming music. [3] X Research source Try different ways to relax before bed to find what works for you. For instance, you might find that reading is too stimulating for you, but a nightly meditation might do the trick. Find what helps you sleep best. Make a list of reasons why extra sleep is so important to help you stay motivated to sleep more."

      "content": "Make small changes to your diet so you eat healthier meals. You probably know that eating nutritious foods is healthy for you. While improving your diet is a great goal, trying to change how you eat all at once can be really challenging, and you could be setting yourself up for failure. Instead, focus on making small switches. Here are some ideas for getting started: If you normally skip breakfast, make overnight oats or buy some yogurt so your breakfast is ready in the morning. For snacks during the day, skip the candy and salty snacks. Instead, choose baby carrots with ranch dressing, apple slices with peanut butter, or string cheese with a handful of grapes. At dinner, fill half your plate with veggies so you’ll be less hungry for other less healthy foods. Place notes or quotes around your kitchen and workspace to remind yourself how healthy eating improves your life. Your notes could say, \"Fruits and veggies = energy,\" \"A healthy diet creates a vibrant life,\" or \"I put good things in my body so I feel my best.\""
