Make sure that all of the cards are facing in the same direction in the pile. Then, place the pile face down on the card spot of the board. There are 11 different types of cards in the deck and they all allow you to do slightly different things. The cards included in Sorry are: [2] X Research source 1: You can move a pawn from the start or move forward 1 space. 2: You can move a pawn from the start or move forward 2 spaces. You must draw again. 3: Move forward 3 spaces. 4: Move backward 4 spaces. 5: Move forward 5 spaces. 7: Move forward 7 spaces or split between 2 pawns (e.g. 3 spaces for one pawn, 4 spaces for another). 8: Move forward 8 spaces. 10: Move forward 10 spaces or move backward 1 space. 11: Move forward 11 spaces or switch places with an opponent. If it is impossible to move forward 11 spaces, and there are no opponent pawns on the board, then you will have to switch places with your partner or forfeit your turn. 12: Move forward 12 spaces. Sorry!: You can save the card for later use, or you can use it to bump an opponent's pawn to the start."
