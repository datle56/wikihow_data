      "content": "Wet your lips just enough to soften them. Since a peck is quick and light, you don’t want rough, chapped lips. Lick your lips lightly, but make sure they’re dry before the kiss by popping them a few times. If you need to, dab a little bit of chapstick onto your top lip and rub it onto your bottom lip. [1] X Research source It’s important that your lips are soft rather than rough, but also only moisturized and not sloppy-wet. If you’re aiming for a romantic kiss, you can drop a hint that you’re about to go for it by saying something like, “Close your eyes,” or even just, “Can I kiss you?”"

      "content": "Close your lips gently. As you go in for the kiss, press your lips together like you're holding your breath. You don't want an open mouth, and you definitely don't want your tongue out at all. Don't press them tightly like your lips are sealed, but just enough that they touch. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Push your lips out a little.",
      "content": "Push your lips out a little. This is called puckering, or pursing, your lips. Imagine you ate something slightly sour, and make that face. Don’t push your lips out so far that your top lip touches your nose. Push them out only so much that the inner part of your lips is visible. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Press your lips lightly against his skin. Whether it’s a kiss on the mouth, the cheek, or the forehead, a peck is always quick and light. You want to press your lips so that he feels it, but not so your lips feel smashed against him. The ideal peck will leave hardly any dampness on his skin. Peck him on the cheek if you just want to be friendly, or even a little flirty. Peck him on the mouth to be more romantic, or to make a move."

      "content": "Pull away in less than 1 second. A peck is the quickest of all kisses, so don’t let it linger! Make the kiss last long enough that your lips touch him, but pull away right after that. Practice the kiss so you get a feel for how long it should be. Remember, touch your lips to skin, and then pull away. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Peck for your first kiss to build up to a bigger kiss. Dating coach Eddy Baller recommends “building up the level of intimacy” on a first date, or before a big first kiss. If you’ve never kissed a guy before, a peck is a good way to start. Follow the usual steps, but plant the peck right on his lips. If it feels good, then turn it into a full kiss , or go in for a second peck right after the first one. If it doesn’t feel right, it’s quick enough that you can pull away. Just remember, you may have to talk about it afterwards if it doesn’t feel right. Pulling away before it turns into a real kiss is also a great way to leave him wanting more. Pro matchmaker LeTisha Underwood says to kiss him like this for the first couple dates to really build tension."

Dating coach Michelle Jacoby recommends asking a first date what they’re comfortable with, then giving a slight peck if they want to show affection in public. Give your guy a little peck on the cheek or lips to show you are together without making it a long drawn out kissing session. If you are out to dinner with your friends and your guy says something especially sweet, give him a peck on the cheek to show your appreciation. If you're at a party and you're leaving your guy to go talk to some other friends, peck him on the lips and say, \"Bye for now.\""

This kind of kiss is common in lots of different cultures, and people do it to family, friends, and sometimes even when meeting for the first time. [7] X Research source That said, it might be romantic! It depends on the person who gave the kiss, and the context. Watch to see if they greet other people this way, too.

      "content": "A peck kiss on the lips might be romantic. While a peck kiss is always more casual and less meaningful than a full kiss, a peck kiss on the lips could be romantic, or hinting toward something romantic. Couples often do it as a small way to show affection. Some people might give a peck kiss on the lips on a first date as a way to express their interest. Again, it depends on the context! If it’s a date, then it’s probably romantic. If it’s more of a group get-together and they’re kissing everyone like this, then it’s probably just casual. A peck kiss is more casual and flirty than a real kiss . Think of it like an appetizer before the full meal. Most people would say that a peck kiss counts as a “real kiss” if it’s on the lips , and is meant as a way to flirt or show your interest. Peck kisses on the hand are also usually romantic. Think of it like a very formal way of flirting!"

      "content": "Pull away and check to see if they’re into it. Baller says to make sure they’re comfortable with a full kiss before committing. There are a few ways to do this. First, pull away from your peck and look them in the eye. If they’re smiling, that’s a green light! If they’re nervous or looking away, leave it at the peck, and save the kiss for another time. The best way to be sure is to ask! Say, “I liked that. Can I give you a real kiss now?” If they say no, no big deal! It doesn’t always mean they don’t want to kiss ever (unless they say that). It could just mean they’re not comfortable with the idea just yet."

      "content": "Make a romantic move like grabbing their chin. Next, Baller suggests starting “with a little bit of light physical contact” before you make your big move. Grab their arm or their hand. Or, for some real fireworks, lightly touch their cheek or their chin. This signals that you’re going in for the big one. You might also put your hand on their thigh or their hip. Or, you might pull them into a close hug."

      "content": "Purse your lips slightly, and touch your lips to theirs. A real kiss is a lot like a peck, just longer! Close your eyes and keep your lips gently shut, and push them out just slightly. Then, go in for it. Press your lips lightly against theirs. That’s all there is to it! [8] X Research source Don’t worry about feeling awkward. If they’ve said or signaled that they want it, then there’s no reason to hesitate. Plus, plenty of first kisses are awkward. It’s all the kisses after that really count."

      "content": "Let the kiss linger for several seconds before pulling away. Now, just enjoy it! Pull away when it feels natural—that’s usually after about 5 seconds, but roll with the vibe, and with your heart. Baller says, “in that kind of moment, it's easy to feel that sexual tension.” If it feels right, you make the kiss more intimate by opening your mouth just a little, and see if they match your energy. If they do, you might consider adding a little tongue ."
