      "content": "Maintain a straight spine while reading to avoid back pain. The straighter that you can keep your spine, the less pressure you’re putting on your lower back. If you’re sitting, rest your butt against the junction where the back of the chair meets the seat. Alternatively, if you’re lying down, keep your spine level with your neck. This will make it easier to keep your spine straight without even thinking about it! [1] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source This will also make it impossible for you to lean too far back if you’re in a chair, since your tailbone will be directly underneath your spine. Don’t worry if this feels a little goofy at first. Many people naturally develop poor posture over the years, but it’s nothing some good habits can’t change. You’ll get used to this over time. The term “straight spine” is a little misleading, since you have some natural curvature in your back. You know that your spine is straight if your shoulders are directly over your hips and your back is firm and upright."

      "content": "Keep your head straight and avoid tilting your neck. Keep your neck aligned with your spine and move your eyes to read from line to line instead of moving your entire head. Unless you’re deliberately stretching your neck out, tilting your head at an angle will result in neck strain. It will also throw your center of gravity slightly off, which may inadvertently put some light pressure on your back.

[3] X Expert Source Jason Myerson, DPT, DMT, OCS, FAAOMPT Physical Therapist & Certified Orthopedic Specialist [v161359_b01] 15 April 2020. Keep your elbows bent and hold the book up a little beneath your eyes. If you hold the book down near your lap, you’ll bend your neck down while reading, which will strain your neck and upper back muscles while you enjoy your book. [4] X Research source Resting your elbows on a table or armchair will make this easier to do over a longer period of time. Otherwise, you can rest your elbows against your sides and bring the book a little closer to your eyes than you normally would. If you prefer to use an e-reader, opt for a lightweight model to make it easier to hold up in front of you."

[5] X Expert Source Jason Myerson, DPT, DMT, OCS, FAAOMPT Physical Therapist & Certified Orthopedic Specialist [v161359_b01] 15 April 2020. For ideal posture, choose a comfortable seat with a straight back that will allow you to rest your entire back against the chair. Any chair, sofa, or bench can work so long as you can sit with your knees at a 90-degree angle and your feet flat on the floor. [6] X Research source Recliners are great for maintaining good posture—especially if they have a footrest. Tilting your spine back 15-30 degrees while keeping your knees at a 90-degree angle is a great way to ensure that your spine stays straight. It tends to be a little harder to hold a book up in one of these chairs, though. While it may seem counterintuitive, a straight-backed chair is actually better for your posture than a soft sofa. You can still put a cushion on the straight-backed chair to make it more comfortable if you’d like. If you're reading in bed, prop yourself up against the headrest or wall with a pillow behind your back for more support. [7] X Research source"

[8] X Expert Source Jason Myerson, DPT, DMT, OCS, FAAOMPT Physical Therapist & Certified Orthopedic Specialist [v161359_b01] 15 April 2020. Get a laptop stand or small adjustable table and set it down in front of you. Set your laptop or e-reader on top of the stand or table so that the screen rests a little under eye level. If the device is on a platform, you won’t need to slump forward to look at it, which can cause neck pain. [9] X Research source There are plenty of cheap options for e-reader stands and using one will keep your arms from getting tired from holding the e-reader up. When your arms get tired, you’re bound to lower them eventually which will cause you to tilt your head down."

      "content": "Keep the room well-lit to avoid straining your eyes or moving your neck. If the room is dark, you’ll struggle to focus your eyes on the text. This means that you’ll naturally squint your eyes and lean forward a little to get a better look at the words. If you’re leaning forward, your spine won’t be straight and your neck will be tilted over your lap. This can lead to a sore back and neck, in addition to strained eyes. [10] X Research source If you’re using a digital e-reader or laptop, make the brightness of the screen lower than the brightest light in the room. It’s relatively difficult for your eyes to focus on a bright digital screen against a dim background. If the digital screen is the brightest source of light in the room, it will strain your eyes and lead to headaches or eye pain. [11] X Research source"

You can sit with your feet planted on the floor at a 90-degree angle, but if you’re struggling to keep your spine straight, prop your feet up a little.

If your back is getting sore while you’re seated, grab a small towel or cloth and roll it up. After sitting down, slide the towel behind your lower back, just above the edge of your tailbone. [14] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source You can use a small pillow instead of a towel if you prefer. You’re not harming your posture by adding a cushion or towel. If you’re comfortable, it’s a good sign that your posture is correct! Giving the lower back additional cushioning is a great way to make sure you aren’t leaning forward or back as well, since you’ll be able to feel the towel sliding down if you lean forward, or compressing against the chair if you lean back."

After 60 continuous minutes of reading, stand up and walk around for a few minutes. Do some simple stretches or callisthenic exercises. You don’t need to work up a sweat or anything, but a little bit of movement will stretch your muscles out and make it less likely that you get sore while you’re reading. Jumping jacks are a great simple way to work your body out for a minute or two. Stretch your arms, roll your neck around the stretch the muscles out, and bend over to touch your toes. You don’t need a full workout or stretching session; a few simple stretches will do the tricks just fine"

To keep them from tightening up, stick your legs out in front of you and roll your ankles around in the air.

A little physical movement will also help your body stay comfortable while you’re sitting for a long period of time. [16] X Research source"
