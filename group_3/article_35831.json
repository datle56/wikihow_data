Ask yourself why you want to reinvent yourself and what you want your future to look like. Make a list of all the things you want to change, and all the ways that you can begin to do so. [1] X Expert Source Lucy Yeh Life Coach Expert Interview. 21 November 2019. Write down the big changes you want to make. Maybe you want to lose a considerable amount of weight; maybe you want to learn to be generous; maybe you want to go from working on Wall Street to being a scuba diving instructor. Whatever big changes you want to make, write them down, and make a list of how you can go about accomplishing those goals. Write down the small changes, too. Though reinventing yourself takes big leaps, Rome wasn't built in a day, and the new you won't be, either. Make a list of small things that can slowly help you build up to your new life. This could be learning to meditate in the morning, volunteering in your community for just an hour a week, or eating more fruits and vegetables every day."

Once you've written down the changes that will give you a new future, write down a reasonable goal for a time when you can say, \"Yeah, I accomplished this thing.\" It could be months, or even a year or more away. But once you pick a date, you'll be closer to your goal. You can make goal dates for the small stuff; for example, you could say, \"I will read three new books by the end of the month.\" Making a plan is a part of the commitment.

You'll feel more confident about your goals once you reflect. Write down at least three reasons why you want to reinvent yourself on an index card. Carry it around with you at all times so that you can pull it out and stay pumped in a moment of weakness."

Sit down with all of the important people in your life and tell them about the change you want to make, and ask for their support during this period of adjustment. They should understand that you're serious about changing and should help motivate and encourage you as you go through this process. [4] X Research source If you're active on social media, share with your online community as well. The more people who know about your plans, the more indebted you'll feel to making this serious commitment. Make sure your loved ones take you seriously. They shouldn't try to draw you in to the \"old you\" that you want to shed."

Here are some great places to start: Think more positively.

Though you may reach your set goals, if you want to be an improved, well-rounded person, you should recognize that there is always more to learn. This will keep you from being complacent and will continue to drive your hunger for knowledge. Here are some traditional and non-traditional ways to get an education: If you've been thinking about going back to school for the last few years, it's time to put down your reservations and apply, no matter how old you are or how insecure you feel. You should enroll in courses at your local community college or a university to improve yourself, especially if you need a more formal education to reach your career goals. Read works by experts on subjects you want to know about. You can learn a lot about almost any given topic by getting the information straight from the horse's mouth. You can make a goal of learning about one completely new subject each week. Travel. Seeing the world in all its glory can help you change your perspective and will help you become more open-minded and learn about how other parts of the world function on a daily basis. Learn a new language. Taking a language class in person, online, or through a textbook can help you expand your brain and learn to think in more than one set way."

You can read a variety of materials, from newspapers, fiction, historical nonfiction, memoirs, or science journals. Anything you read, as long as it comes from a credible source, will help you build knowledge and become a more well-rounded person. Here are some great things to read: Read philosophy. Philosophy will expand your worldview and will show that the world is more complicated than it seems. It will also open up more ways of viewing your daily life, and will help you improve the vision you have of the future you. Read international fiction. Reading works by authors from different countries will help you gain an understanding of how people live on the others side of the world. Reading about other countries is also a great way to travel without moving from your couch. Read the newspaper. Make a goal of reading the newspaper for just 10-15 minutes a day, so that you feel more complete as you follow current events and have a stronger sense of how the world works. Read the classics. Indulge in Tolstoy, Dickens, or Poe, and you'll feel like you have a more well-informed knowledge of the history of literature. And after all, literature can teach you a lot about how to live, and many classics are about a central character who is trying to reinvent himself."

Take the time to talk to the people around you to see what valuable knowledge they can impart, and how they can give you the skills you need to fully tackle your reinvention goals. Here are a few ways to learn from others: Ask a close friend to teach you a skill. If you have a friend who cooks like a world-class chef, dances like a professional, or just really loves watercolor painting, ask if the friend can spend an afternoon with you to teach you the ropes. Ask your colleagues for work-related help. Talk to people who have been working at your company longer than you and ask a few questions that can help improve your productivity or the way you approach your work. And if you're looking for a career change, talk to some people who are experts in your new career of choice, and see what advice they can give you. Talk to your older relatives. Take the time to talk to your older relatives, not only for life advice, but to learn more about your family history.

Keep a clear work space, a logical filing system, and a decluttered home. If you know where everything is all the time, it'll be easier for you to concentrate on any given tasks. Learn to avoid distractions. Spend less time browsing the Internet, watching shows that don't matter, or texting your friends nonstop instead of just making one phone call. Push away all of the things that are keeping you from accomplishing your goals. Let yourself take a break. Part of focusing means taking breaks after every hour of intense work.

If you have long hair, why not chop it just above your chin? Sick of the same brown hair you've had since the beginning of time? Go blonde. Change the way you dress. Have you always gone grungy? Go for a sleek look. Have you always been preppy? Try the hipster trend. Improve your body language. Your body language is a big part of your appearance, so you can work on standing taller, keeping your arms at your sides instead of crossed over your chest, and making eye contact when you talk. Smile more. Smiling will give you a healthy glow and will make you look like a more positive person."

If you're a big talker, take the time to listen more and talk less, and you'll find that you'll learn a lot more. If you're shy, try to talk more often in everyday conversation, and you'll find that you have more to contribute than you think. Change how you talk. If you're a fast-talker, take the time to slow down and articulate every word. If you talk softly, work on talking louder and with more confidence. Change the things you talk about. If you spend more time grousing or complaining than you'd like, work on talking about the positive things in your life, and the things that make you happy. Gossip less. Though it's tough to stop gossiping completely, try to avoid saying bad things about people behind their backs, making fun of people, or just generally being not nice. You'll feel much better about yourself if you find yourself saying nice things about people when they aren't there."

Here are some great ways to change your environment: If you really want to reinvent yourself, consider moving to a completely new place where you don't know anybody. This may be scary, but this will make it easier for you to disconnect from your old self. Move into a new home. If you're sick of your old apartment but have been too lazy to move to a new place, now's the time. Living in a place that makes you feel comfortable and different can help you transition more smoothly into your new skin. Go on vacation. Though a vacation isn't a good permanent solution to any problem, taking a week or two to travel in a new place, whether it's a foreign country or a national park a few hours away from home, will help you clear your head and better complete your vision of your future. Renovate your space. If you can't move and don't have time for a vacation, try painting your walls a new color, moving your furniture around, and throwing out or donating any furniture or clothes you don't need. You can change your space enough to make it feel like a new environment. Consider working abroad. This is a dramatic move, but it will certainly help you reinvent yourself even faster."
