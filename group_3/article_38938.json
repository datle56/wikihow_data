      "content": "Create a mounded surface in the tank. Though red-clawed crabs are aquatic, they do breathe air. These means they’ll need high areas above the water line that they can reach by walking or climbing. You can create this with the decor items, or add a ramp for this specific purpose.

Remember, hiding spaces make the crab feel secure, so place them in accessible spots and make sure they’re large enough for your crab. Choose the decor. Red-clawed crabs like to climb, hide, and dig, so you need to provide them with items to interact with, such as: [4] X Research source Slopes Driftwood Plants Rocks Caves Pebbles Sand"

      "content": "Fill the tank with room temperature brackish water. Though red-clawed crabs are freshwater creatures, they thrive in lightly salted water. Mix 1 teaspoon of sea salt per litre of 72-82°F water, and add it to the tank. Make sure to leave some areas above the waterline which the crab can reach to breathe. [5] X Research source"

[9] X Research source By changing the water, you dilute the nitrates and ammonia in the water, as well as remove other toxins and pollutants that may build up in the tank. [10] X Research source Scoop out the old tank water using a vessel like a large cup or small bucket, and add an equal volume of new tap water back into the tank."

      "content": "Clean the filter. Your filter may be mechanical, chemical, or biological. It will need to be cleaned every 1-2 months, depending on the type of filter. The cleaning will likely involve rinsing of the sponge or pads and scrubbing of the casing and tubes. Specific instructions for cleaning your filter will be included in the owner’s manual. Follow these to guarantee the filter continues to function properly."
