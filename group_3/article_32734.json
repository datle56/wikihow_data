      "content": "Use a lock-picking kit for the best results. Using a lock-picking kit will save you time and make it easier to unlock your mailbox. Lock-picking kits come with multiple lockpicks and levers (tension wrenches) to choose from, so you have options in case something doesn’t fit in your mailbox lock. If you don’t own a lock-picking kit, order one online or look for one at your local hardware store. [1] X Research source Vallelunga says, “Lock picking uses a rake and a tension wrench. You’ll need both. The pick’s purpose is to slide along the pins of the lock quickly and push them up into the cylinder. While doing this, the tension wrench applies slight pressure to the cylinder.”"

      "content": "Or, make a DIY lockpick and lever out of 2 hairpins. If you don’t have a lock-picking kit, make your own lockpick by using hair pins (bobby pins). Vallelunga says, “The pick can be made by straightening out the 180 bend in the hairpin. This will leave you with a straight hairpin with little ridges in it. The little ridges will hit the pins and push them up as you slide the hairpin back and forth.” To make the lever, bend the second hairpin at the point that’s about .5 inches (1.3 cm) away from the curved part of the hairpin. Once you’ve made a 90-degree angle, stop bending the hairpin. Use a pair of needle nose pliers to help you bend the hairpins if you’re having trouble. Vallelunga says, “It would be very difficult to make a tension wrench out of a hairpin because you’d really have nothing to hold onto to keep pressure applied. Use a small screwdriver or something else for that purpose.”"

      "content": "Alternatively, fashion a lockpick and lever out of 2 paper clips. To make a lockpick with paperclips , Vallelunga says, “The pick can be made by straightening out the paper clip and then bending the end into a little bump (a tiny little hill in the straight clip). The bump is what hits the pins and pushes them up as you slide the paperclip back and forth. To make the lever, straighten out the second paper clip almost all the way, leaving one bent curve at one end of the paper clip. Then, bend that curve until it’s at a 90-degree angle from the rest of the paper clip. As with hairpins, Vallelunga says it would be “very difficult” to make a tension wrench out of a paperclip and recommends using a small screwdriver instead."

Once the lever is inside the lock, press the long end in the direction you would turn the key to unlock your mailbox. While you’re picking the lock , continue to press the lever in this direction to apply pressure to the barrel of the lock. Without the pressure on the barrel, you won’t be able to pick the lock open.

      "content": "Insert the bent end of your lockpick into the lock. Inside the lock, there are 5 pins that need to be raised to the same height in order for the barrel to turn and unlock the lock. The bent part of your lockpick will lift these pins to the right height. When you insert the lockpick into the lock, keep it close to the opening of the lock, as that’s where the first pin is located. [3] X Research source"

Push up on the first pin using the end of your lockpick. If the pin pushes up without any resistance, it’s not seized. Push it up and continue to the second pin. If it is seized, wiggle the lockpick up and down to force the pin up above the barrel. [4] X Research source You’ll hear a click whenever a seized pin is raised up all the way."

If you encounter a seized pin, force it upward using the lockpick. Make sure you hear a click after you raise a seized pin before you move on. Repeat this process until you’ve successfully raised all 5 pins. [5] X Research source"

Many mailboxes are not rekeyable, so your locksmith may have to drill out the lock and replace it with a new one. Sometimes, however, they may be able to make a new key so you can unlock your mailbox. [7] X Research source Be aware that hiring a locksmith can be pretty pricey. Prices vary from location to location and from company to company, so call around to find the best prices in your area."

If you’re looking for a quick way to open your locked mailbox, insert the screwdriver into the small gap between the door and the box on the side of the keyhole. [8] X Research source Pry the door open as far as you can without using force, then push the claw end of the hammer into the opening. Remove your screwdriver, then use the hammer as a lever to apply quick force and open the door. If the lock doesn’t pop, you need more leverage. Try a crowbar instead of a hammer. Do not use this method on thin metal, as it may distort the metal and leave the mailbox unusable. It may also damage any surrounding mailboxes."

      "content": "Drill through the mailbox and replace the lock. This is typically how locksmiths replace locks. Remove the lock’s dust cover, and use a punch to make a dimple in the lock so the drill bit doesn’t slide away. Use an electric drill to drill straight through the lock. Once you drill to the other side, there will be nothing holding the tailpiece of the lock in place. You’ll then be able to open the door and replace the lock. [9] X Research source Choose a drill bit that is slightly larger than the keyway."

If your mailbox is owned and maintained by the United States Postal Service, do not try to break into it, as doing so is illegal. Instead, contact your local post office to see if they can replace the lock or give you a new key. [10] X Research source If you own the mailbox, it is legal to break into it and replace the lock yourself. Remember, though, that just because the mailbox is on your property doesn’t necessarily mean you own it. Make sure it isn’t owned by the USPS or anyone else first. It is also illegal to break into a mailbox belonging to anyone else. Be aware that the legalities of lockpicking vary from location to location, so familiarize yourself with the laws of your area first. In some places, owning a lockpicking kit is illegal if you don’t have a legitimate reason for owning it."
