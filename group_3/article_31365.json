      "content": "“Noice” is just stylized slang for “nice” with an Australian or British accent. It means “nice” or “awesome,” and it’s typically used as an exclamation at the end of a statement from someone else to indicate approval. “Noice” is an exaggerated form of “nice” and means mostly the same thing, but “noice” carries more playfulness and familiarity between the speaker and the person they're talking to than “nice” does. The word is commonly used in colloquial speech and online, and it’s pronounced just like it looks—it rhymes with Joyce , voice , or choice . It’s especially prevalent in gaming communities and may be used by anyone, but it’s more frequently linked to young adult men. The comparative and superlative forms of the word are noicer and noicest , respectively."

      "content": "\"Noice\" likely began as a way to stereotype British and Australian accents. It’s unclear exactly where the term “noice” as a slang word originated, but we know it’s a written representation of how you might say “nice” in an Australian, Cockney, or Norfolk British accent. Charles Dickens used the term “noice” to represent a character’s thick English accent in Nicholas Nickleby in 1838: “‘Ye be noice chaps.’” So, the word’s been around for quite some time—but it’s unlikely modern TikTok users grabbed it from this book. The term and exaggerated Australian accents in general may be associated with Crocodile Hunter Steve Irwin or Australian sitcom Kath & Kim ."

      "content": "Key and Peele released a skit called Nooice in 2013. In the skit , two dance video hype men fall in love after a dispute about who owns the catchphrase “Noice.” It ended up being one of the most popular Key & Peele skits ever, and while it may not have originated the term “noice,” it likely helped propel the word into popular usage."

      "content": "A video of author Michael Rosen using the word went viral in 2015. The 2013 video featured English children’s author Rosen reciting his poem “Hot Food,” in which he repeats variations on the line, “I only put a little bit on my fork and I blow [imitates blowing] ‘til it’s cool, just cool, then into the mouth, [imitates eating, smacks lips]: noice.” Unlike in the Key & Peele sketch, which used the term in the slang way we tend to use it now, Rosen said “noice” because…well, he’s English, and that’s how he says the word! But Rosen’s comedic delivery paired with his pronunciation of “noice” caused the video to take off a few years after it was posted, further cementing the popularity of the term."

      "content": "Say \"noice\" after someone says or does something you like or are excited by. It’s a great way to show you approve of what has happened or what’s been said, while also demonstrating some playfulness, confidence, and pizzazz. Keep in mind \"noice\" is generally only used in informal, friendly settings. In other words, when your boss tells you you can take off early, don't say, \"Noice!\" “I had a really great time on our date last night.” “Noice!” “How about pizza for dinner?” “Noice!” *Sees a dog* “Noice!\""

In standard British and American English, the long i vowel sound in words such as “bite,” “tight,” or “nice” is known as a diphthong (that is, two vowel sounds joined in one syllable to form a single sound) and is formed with lips unrounded. [1] X Research source But in some Australian and British accents (as well as New York English), the long i sound begins with lips rounded, creating a rounder oi sound, as in moist or coil , or, yes, noice ."

      "content": "\"Noice\" and \"niiiice\" are often used interchangeably, but have different vibes. Many people use \"noice\" and \"niiiice\" to mean pretty much the same thing: approval or satisfaction, with a playful spin. \"Niiiice\" is just a little more chill and drawn out, while \"noice\" is more rowdy and exuberant. \"Niiiice\" may also be used more frequently than \"noice\" in a sexual or flirtatious context. For example: If you find out you've passed a test you studied hard for, you might let out a celebratory \"Noice!\" (But you could also use \"Niiiice\" here, to be honest.) But, when you see what your date is wearing on your night out, you might say, \"Niiiice\" to sound more suave and flirty. Saying \"Noice\" in this context would probably take the vibe from flirty and sexy to friendly and boisterous."
