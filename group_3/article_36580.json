If it does leave behind a backing or if it won't budge, you'll need to use water to assist you in the removal process. [5] X Research source Some very stubborn wallpapers may even need to be steamed away. But, try using hot water first before you rent a steamer."

Simply run the tool over the wallpaper while applying light pressure. [7] X Expert Source Mike Katona DIY Home Improvement Specialist Expert Interview. 25 August 2021. [8] X Research source This step is most helpful for waterproof wallpapers or ones that are glossy or made of vinyl.

Scorers quickly poke hundreds of tiny little holes into the wallpaper. You can buy them at all home improvement stores or online for $10 or less."

[11] X Research source If you're working with plaster walls, don't worry about how much water you're applying—it can take a lot of liquid! But if you're working with drywall , try to only use as much water as you need—saturation for more than 15 minutes can cause permanent damage."

Take your time and rewet the wall as you go to help the process move along. [12] X Research source You could also use a metal spatula to the same effect. The more flexible the instrument, the less likely it'll be to mark up the wall. If you discover a second layer of wallpaper underneath the first, focus on removing the top layer completely before thinking about the second layer. That bottom layer will come up much more easily if the first layer is completely gone."
