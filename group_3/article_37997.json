      "title": "Sapiosexuality means being attracted to people based on intelligence.",
      "content": "Sapiosexuality means being attracted to people based on intelligence. Someone who is sapiosexual finds intellect more attractive and important than gender identity or biological sex. [1] X Research source People who identify as sapiosexual can only develop an attraction to someone who stimulates their mind intellectually. The term “sapiosexual” is used by both people who identify as heterosexual and people who belong to the LGBTQIA+ community. Being sapiosexual is sometimes confused with being graysexual or demisexual, but all three are distinct terms. People who identify as graysexual experience sexual attraction infrequently or not very strongly. Hence, their sexual attraction is in the gray area between being asexual and sexual. People who identify as demisexual don’t feel sexual attraction to someone unless they already have a strong emotional bond with that person."

      "title": "People argue whether sapiosexuality is a true sexual orientation.",
      "content": "People argue whether sapiosexuality is a true sexual orientation. Some believe that sapiosexuality is a form of romantic preference or turn-on. Many argue that claiming sapiosexuality as a sexual orientation is a way to align oneself with LGBTQIA+ groups without being marginalized and discriminated against in the same way other members of that group are. [2] X Research source Sapiosexuality is also criticized for being ableist and elitist. Critics argue that sapiosexuality leaves out people who are neurodivergent and people with learning disabilities. Others claim that those who identify as sapiosexual are only attracted to Western standards of intelligence, such as a high score on the IQ test or access to higher education."

      "content": "You prioritize intellect and intelligence when choosing a date. If you’re swiping through dating apps, you’ll be drawn toward people who show intelligence in their prompts (or maybe even have a bookstore as the background for their first photo). When meeting people in person, you will only be attracted to people once you have a good sense of their intelligence. But once you get a whiff of someone’s smarts, all bets are off, and it doesn’t matter if other people find them physically or sexually attractive."

      "content": "You feel “seen” by the label of sapiosexual. Maybe you’ve always felt a bit outside the norm when you see people around you dating. Sapiosexuality might make you feel like there’s a word for how you’re attracted to and interact romantically with others—and being seen in that way is a wonderful feeling."

Having deep conversations , joining a book club, or learning a new skill together are all ways to bond with a sapiosexual partner.

      "content": "Partner feeling pressure If one partner has communicated that they’re sapiosexual, the other person may feel pressure to be or appear smarter.

[3] X Research source Remember that having a successful relationship depends on you being yourself —the right person for you will love you exactly how you are. You shouldn’t have to prove yourself to anyone via looks or brains!"
