Many other types of fruit trees are best pruned in the winter while they’re dormant, but apricot trees can be especially prone to catching disease. [2] X Expert Source Steve Masley Home & Garden Specialist Expert Interview. 19 June 2019. Pruning an apricot plant in the summer enables the tree to heal quickly and seal itself from moisture, which can cause damage and introduce disease. [3] X Trustworthy Source Royal Horticultural Society Leading gardening charity in the U.K. providing resources for identifying, growing and caring for flowers and other plants Go to source Trim your tree as soon as possible after harvesting fruit. At this stage, the tree will still be in a growth phase and will be able to heal more quickly. Pruning in late summer gives your apricot tree more time to grow new branches, which means that your tree will produce more apricots next year."

      "content": "Acquire sharp pruning shears and a pruning saw. The blades on your shears should be sturdy, not corroded, and able clip through smaller branches. A pruning saw is usually necessary to cut thicker branches. It should have a curved blade and wide teeth. Older tools can often be sharpened at your local hardware store. If you can’t reach the top of your tree, you’ll also need a sturdy ladder. Folding and leaning ladders not safe to use when pruning, as they’re not stable on uneven ground. Instead, use an orchard ladder, which has a more sturdy tripod structure."

Soak shears and saws for 30 seconds to make sure they’re clean and won’t transmit any diseases to your tree. If you’re pruning multiple apricot trees, re-soak your tools in between each tree.

Cut them off at their base, as close to the trunk or branch as possible, without leaving a stub. [8] X Research source “Suckers” are small sprouts coming out of the base of the trunk. Look for them below the main branches of the tree, closer to the ground. “Watersprouts” are shoots that grow straight up from the main branches of the apricot tree. These perfectly vertical new branches won’t produce fruit, but often block sunlight from reaching the fruit on lower branches."

      "content": "Choose a few healthy scaffold branches that you want to keep. Optimal tree growth can be promoted by choosing 3-5 branches located 18–36 inches (46–91 cm) from the ground. These will serve as your primary fruit-producing branches. [11] X Research source It’s best to choose branches that are growing outwards away from the trunk, rather than straight up, as vertically-growing branches are more prone to snapping off if they produce a lot of heavy fruit. Think of a clock, and look to keep branches growing outwards at about a 2:00 or 10:00 angle. All of the scaffold branches should be evenly spaced around the trunk of the tree so that the tree’s structure is well-balanced. Mark these scaffold branches with a piece of brightly-colored ribbon or string, so you won’t accidentally trim them later. Keeping these intact will help prevent over-pruning and ensure your apricot tree’s overall structure is sound."

      "content": "Cut most of the remaining branches about 0.25 inches (0.64 cm) above where they connect to the trunk. Use a shears to clip thinner, new branches, or use a pruning saw to cut thicker boughs. Look for the collar at the base of the branch. This is a thicker, ridged area of bark that connects the branch to the trunk. Cut the branch just outside the collar, as this region promotes formation of new tissue and cutting it can cause damage and introduce decay."

This helps promote adequate air circulation and lets sunlight reach all the way down through the tree to apricots on the lower branches. [12] X Research source Thinner branches towards the top of the tree can be left a little closer together, whereas the thickest branches towards the bottom need the most space."

Depending on how large the tree is, and how much it grew within the past year, this could mean trimming anywhere from 2 inches (5.1 cm) to 4 feet (1.2 m). Chopping the ends encourages branches to grow shorter and bushier and spurs the tree to grow more fruit on the lower branches. [15] X Research source Trimming vertical branches encourages new branches and leaves to form, and prevents them from growing too tall and blocking sunlight. Pruning horizontal branches promotes new fruit-producing wood."

      "content": "Trim branches to 0.25 inches (0.64 cm) above a bud, stub, or branch. Buds will continue to grow in the same direction as they’re currently facing, so choose a bud that faces outward, away from the trunk and other nearby branches. Cut at a 45 degree angle away from the bud. For example, if you’re shortening a branch that’s close to another branch, trim it near a bud that’s facing the opposite direction of the nearby branch. Shortening a branch will make buds within 1–8 inches (2.5–20.3 cm) of the cut grow more vigorously, so make sure you’re trimming at a place along the branch that gives new buds room to grow."
