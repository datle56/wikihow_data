Take 2 pegs of the same color and put them at the start of the track so one is in front of the other. Have the other player put their pegs at the start of a different track. [1] X Research source Most cribbage boards have 2 or 3 tracks. It doesn’t matter which track you choose as long as both of your pegs are in the same one. The cribbage board is just a way to visually keep track of the score. If you don’t have a board at home, you can track your score with pen and paper."

Take turns cutting the cards and revealing the bottom card of the section you picked up. Whoever has the card with the lowest value becomes the dealer and the other player becomes the “pone.” [2] X Research source Kings are the highest-value cards and aces have the lowest value.

Set those cards face-down in front of the dealer to form their “crib,” which is an extra hand that’s hidden and scored at the end of the round. Keep the 4 leftover cards in your hand. You score points at the end of the round for pairs, runs, and sets of cards that total 15 in your hand. Try to keep cards that will score points in your hand."

[4] X Research source Both players can use the start card to make combos and score points with their hands at the end of the round. If the start card is a jack, the dealer immediately scores 2 points, known as “his heels.” Move the peg furthest back on your track that many spaces ahead of the front peg."

Continue alternating turns for the rest of the round. [6] X Research source Example: If your opponent starts with a 3 and you play a 4 on your turn, you would say “7” as the new total.

Whenever you score points, take the peg of your color that’s furthest back and move it ahead of the one that’s in front. That way, players can see the last amount that you scored. When a played card brings the count exactly to 15, score 2 points. If the last card played makes the total count 31, score 2 points. If you make a pair by matching the last card your opponent played, get 2 points. If your opponent has another matching card, they’ll earn 6 points. If you are able to play the 4th card of the same value, you move forward 12 points! If the card you play completes a sequential run of cards, earn 1 point for each card in the run, no matter what order the cards were played in. For example, if you played a 4 on your turn and your opponent played a 2 on their turn, you could play a 3 to earn 3 points. If you play the last card for the round, gain 1 point."
