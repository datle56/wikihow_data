      "content": "Clean the decal and the surrounding area. Fill a small bucket with warm water and add a couple squirts of liquid dish detergent or laundry soap. Dunk a sponge in the bucket and rub the area well to ensure that no dirt or grime interfere with the decal’s ability to separate. [1] X Research source"
