      "content": "Page-based reading plan Take the number of pages in your edition of the Bible and divide it by 365—then, read that number of pages every day . For example, if your edition of the Bible has 1,760 pages, that’s around 4.8 pages a day (or 5, rounded up). If a daily reading plan doesn’t make sense with your schedule, try calculating a monthly page count instead. Just divide the number of pages in your Bible by 12 instead of 365."
