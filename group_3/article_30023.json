      "title": "Choose a sturdy hanger.",
      "content": "Choose a sturdy hanger. You'll want to use a hanger that will not easily snap. Test the strength of the hanger with your hands by tugging on it in various directions. If it feels brittle or like it might break, it may not be strong enough to be used for a bow"

    {
      "title": "Cut the hanger.",
      "content": "Cut the hanger. The traditional shape of a bow is a smooth arc. To make this, you'll need to remove the hook with a sturdy pair of scissors or a sharp, durable knife. Then, if any sharp edges remain, use a file to blunt the edges. For stubborn hangers that refuse to cut, you may need to notch the attitude with your knife first, and then cut it with your scissors. For more authentic bows, you might also remove the plastic connector running between the ends of the arc of your hanger. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Wrap your bow in duct tape. Take your duct tape and wrap it smoothly around your coat hanger until all surfaces are covered. Be sure your tape is wrapped thickly enough so that no edges of plastic protrude. Colored duct tape can be used to add a personal touch to your bow. Silver, gold, black, and brown duct tape are good duct tape colors to consider for giving your bow some character."

      "title": "Fashion your bowstring.",
      "content": "Fashion your bowstring. The string of your bow should be made of thick, sturdy rubber bands. Depending on the length of your bow and the size of your hanger, three to five bands should be enough to make your string. Cut each in half with your scissors and tie the ends together with simple knots. [2] X Research source You can strengthen your bowstring by doubling or tripling the single string with more bands."

    {
      "title": "Tie your bowstring to your bow.",
      "content": "Tie your bowstring to your bow. Now that you have your bowstring made, you can tie it to the end of the arc of your coat hanger to complete the bow. If you find that the bowstring doesn't stay in place, take a knife and cut V shaped notches into the plastic at either end. Then you can re-tie your bowstring so that it's seated securely in the notches."

      "content": "Wrap your arrows in duct tape. You'll be using pencils to make your arrows. Wrap these completely in a layer of duct tape to give them a more realistic appearance. You may want to use a different color of duct tape for your arrows than you used for your bow, though this is a matter of preference."

      "title": "Draw your arrowheads.",
      "content": "Draw your arrowheads. Draw two triangles on a piece of card stock or rigid cardboard for each arrowhead you plan on making. To make your arrowheads uniform, you can draw an arrowhead stencil, cut it free, and then use this to trace the shapes of the rest of your arrowheads. Your arrowheads can be as large or as small as you like, but for more polished looking arrowheads, measure out 2-inch (5 cm) sides for all three sides of your triangular arrowhead."

      "content": "Glue your arrowheads together. Take the two pieces of card stock that you have cut into the shape of arrowheads and use your glue to attach these to the tip of your arrow. If the card stock you are using is a little on the flimsy side, you might want to reinforce your arrowheads by putting small pieces toothpicks, cake pop sticks, or kebab sticks between pieces, gluing the supports in place as you glue the pieces together."

Mark your cardboard tube with the shorter length and use your scissors to cut the tube so it is an inch shorter than your arrows. Then, use your duct tape to cover the outside of your tube and close off one of the ends."

      "title": "Use PVC pipe to make a better bow.",
      "content": "Use PVC pipe to make a better bow. A PVC pipe bow will be more authentic than cardboard models or bows made of light plastic. PVC is more ideal for bow-making, as it is rigid enough to provide the tension necessary for firing an arrow, but is not so weak that it will break after a few uses. CPVC inserts at either end of your PVC bow will serve to reinforce the ends by adding thickness. This will result in a sturdier construction and will also help prevent cracking."

Insert one 1½-inch CPVC piece into the long PVC piece until it is nested completely inside the long PVC piece. The fit will be tight and might require you to twist the smaller piece back and forth, or you may need to tap the small CPVC piece into place gently with a hammer. Do this for both sides. [3] X Research source The ends of your short CPVC pieces and your long PVC piece should be even when you finish this."

Decide which side of your pipe will be the back of your bow. The back of your bow is the side your string will run along, so your slots will need to be on this side on either end of your long piece. Your slots should be about ½-inch (1¼ cm) long. [4] X Research source"

After this is done, bend the top of the C so that it faces you while the bottom points off to the side. Now you can: Measure the middle point of the left side of your handle with your tape measure. Place the bottom of your paper clip at the midpoint with the bottom of the paper clip facing away from the bow and your offset top piece flat against the bow. Use your electrical tape to attach your paperclip to firmly to the bow. Note: the top of your paper clip will act as a stopper so your arrow holder does not get pushed back against the bow, but it will allow your holder to move forward and out of the way of arrows when shooting."

Two to four inches (5 - 10 cm) extra should be ample for the purposes of stringing your bowline and tying knots. Cutting paracord can leave frayed edges. You can \"re-seal\" the ends of your cord by holding it in the flame of a match or lighter for a few moments until the ends melt closed. Allow at least a minute to pass for the ends to cool.

Take your dowels one at a time and put an eraser cap on each to give it the appearance of a pointed arrow head. To create a sturdier arrow, you might use glue on the end of your dowel. Do this before putting on the eraser cap to create a seal between the arrowhead and arrow. If you use glue, be sure to allow your arrows to dry completely."
