      "content": "“Shrimps is bugs” is a nonsensical phrase that came from Reddit. The phrase came from a viral Reddit post and quickly became an internet meme. Part of the reason why it’s funny is because it seems true—shrimp look a lot like other insects. The bad grammar and the uncapitalized, small font that many of the memes use also add to the phrase’s comedic effect. Since the phrase is talking about the entire species of shrimp, the correct version of the sentence should be “shrimps are bugs.” The meme is also funny because it originally came from a picture of a tattoo, which means someone liked the phrase enough to permanently inscribe it on their body. Although people like to speculate whether the phrase has a deeper meaning, the original poster even admitted that “it was just a dumb inside joke.”"

      "title": "The Shrimps Is Bugs meme is from a tattoo posted on Reddit.",
      "content": "The Shrimps Is Bugs meme is from a tattoo posted on Reddit. In May 2023, Reddit user u/Lewbular posted a photo of a tattoo above his knee that says “shrimps is bugs” (along with a smaller tattoo of a hand above it) to the subreddit, r/tattoodesigns. The user then asked fellow Redditors for “Cover up suggestions?” The original post says, “I need ideas for a horizontal design for this dumb tattoo I got above my knee when I was 19. I like American traditional/black and grey type stuff but I haven’t been able to find any designs that would cover it and look good. Any ideas are appreciated. P.s. the little guy above it can stay or go as long as shrimps is bugs is covered.” The post quickly went viral and has over 2,000 comments. The most popular responses ask the original poster not to get rid of the tattoo because it’s so hilarious. The top comment is by a deleted user, who said “This may be the best tattoo I’ve ever seen. It would be a travesty to get it covered. Now, what you should do is get a frame tattoo around it.” In the r/ShrimpsIsBugs subreddit (which was created a day after the post was made) u/Lewbular eventually posted “...holy sh*t. Alright fine I’ll keep it.”"

Just a day after the original tattoo was posted, the r/ShrimpsIsBugs subreddit started filling with memes about real shrimps, along with images of their pets lying curled up in “shrimp-like” positions. The viral phrase has also been printed on hats, shirts, and other items. In the r/ShrimpsIsBugs subreddit, u/g0back2bed posted a picture of a cake with two shrimps and the famous phrase drawn in icing."

Redditor u/TyrannosaurusWreckd posted a photo of a shrimp with the phrase in ribbons above and below it, with the caption “Looking for cover up suggestions,” referencing the original post. u/Fl1pper_ shared a picture of the tattooed phrase with the caption “Never get drunk around someone with a tattoo machine.”"

      "content": "No, shrimps are technically crustaceans while bugs are insects. Shrimps come from the scientific class Crustacea, while bugs are part of the Insecta class. However, shrimps and bugs share a common ancestor that lived half a billion years ago, and they have a lot of physical similarities. [1] X Research source For example, both have exoskeletons and no backbone. [2] X Research source Not all insects are bugs. Bugs (or “true bugs”) come from the Hemiptera group under the Insecta class. True bugs include cicadas, bed bugs, and plant hoppers. [3] X Research source Bugs and shrimps belong to the Arthropod phylum (or group). Arthropods include animals with invertebrates, segmented bodies, and jointed legs, like insects, arachnids, and crustaceans. [4] X Research source"
