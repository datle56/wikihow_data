They come in all sorts of shapes and sizes, so buy a zipper pull tab that is proportionate to your zipper slider. [1] X Expert Source Korri Burton-Universe Professional Tailor Expert Interview. 12 January 2021. If you have a large, heavy duty zipper, you should buy a large pull tab. If you have a smaller garment zipper, like what you would find on a dress, buy a small pull tab instead. You can also salvage a replacement pull tab from another zipper. If you don't know what size to get, bring the original pull tab or zipper into the store with you."

Grab the loop by the base with a pair of pliers or metal snips, then pull the loop off. Be aware that this may damage some zipper sliders.

      "content": "Remove the old zipper pull tab, if needed. If you pulled the top part of the slider off, there is nothing holding the old pull tab in place. Simply lift it off of the zipper. If your zipper slider has a hook-type loop instead, grab the old zipper pull tab and wriggle it out. You made have to lift it up so that it is perpendicular to the zipper slider first. If you still can't get the old pull tab out of the hook-type loop, pry the hook open with a flat-head screw driver. You may have to use a pair of pliers to grab and twist broken pull tabs. For separating zippers, you can clip the first stop at the top of the zipper, and for non-separating zippers, you can remove the metal stop at the bottom of the zipper and take out the zipper pull.

      "content": "Move the locking mechanism out of the way, if needed. Some types of zippers have a locking mechanism. You can see this mechanism if you look closely at the zipper from the side, then move it up and down. You'll notice a lock moving up and down inside the loop that the zipper pull was attached to. [9] X Research source The locking mechanism needs to be out of the loop. If you can see the lock inside the loop, then move the zipper slider slowly until the loop is clear."

Pry open the end with your fingernail, a flat-head screwdriver, or a knife. Slide the end of the key ring into the loop. Feed the key ring through the loop until it is completely attached and closes by itself. [10] X Research source A key ring is a great option for jean zippers that won't stay shut. Zipper up your jeans, slide the key ring over the button, then close the button. Avoid using key rings that are too large, or they will look clunky."

[11] X Research source If you are using nylon cording, you can melt the cut ends with a lighter or a candle flame for a smoother finish. Match the color of the cording to the zipper, if possible."

Match up the ends of the ribbon to make sure that it is centered, then finish it in 1 of the following ways: [12] X Research source Tie the ends together in an overhand knot to make a loop. Sew across the ends 2 to 3 times using a zigzag stitch to create a loop. Use hot glue or fabric glue to glue both ribbon halves together to form a single strip."

Trim the excess wire off with wire cutters so that it is between 1 ⁄ 2 and 1 inch (1.3 and 2.5 cm) long.

Slide 1 end of the jump ring through the loop on your charm. Slide the other end of the jump ring through the loop on the zipper slider. Use the pliers again to close the jump ring. [15] X Research source Choose a jump ring that is between 1 ⁄ 4 and 1 ⁄ 2 inch (0.64 and 1.27 cm) wide, and made from thick wire. Use a charm that is easy to hold between your thumb and index finger. Hold each side of the jump ring with a pair of pliers. Pull the ends past each other to open the jump ring, and towards each other to close it, just like a door. Do not pull the ends of the jump ring away from each other like sliding open a drawer. This will distort the shape of the jump ring."
