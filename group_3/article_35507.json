You can do the following to strengthen your account security once you have recovered it: Use a strong password that is unique, long, and hard to guess. You should use a different password for all of your accounts, and a password manager can help you remember them. Ensure the linked email and phone number belong to you. If these have been changed, change them to your phone number and an email address. Use 2FA. Two-factor authentication adds another layer of security to your account by requiring you to verify your identity when logging in to your Snapchat account. Forget linked devices you don't recognize.
