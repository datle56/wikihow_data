      "content": "Monarch butterflies are symbols of hope, rebirth, and transformation. The beautifully winged creatures start as nothing more than a caterpillar—small and ordinary. But then they fold themselves into a chrysalis and start to change. With great effort, they crawl out of their “shell” to flap their new wings and fly. [1] X Research source There are many odds against a butterfly in all its forms, yet it still prevails to become the beautiful creature it was born to be. The natural perseverance of a butterfly is an embodiment of hope. Even when it's trapped in a chrysalis, this insect can dig itself out. The change from a caterpillar to a butterfly represents rebirth and transformation as this insect moves from one stage of life to the next."

For Mexicans, this represents family unity and expresses the notion that we’re all family in the afterlife.
