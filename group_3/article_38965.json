The new interface will ask you for details so that it can generate your key pair. It will ask you for your name and e-mail address, for example. For name, put your screen name; you can either leave e-mail blank, put your real e-mail address, or use a fake e-mail address. It should be noted that the name and e-mail address you use will be visible to anyone you send your public key to. It will also ask you for a comment, which you can leave blank if you wish, or you can put a comment in if you have a reason to do so."
