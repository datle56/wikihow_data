      "content": "Freeze garlic. This is the easiest way to preserve garlic for later use. Simply peel the garlic cloves, put them in a plastic bag, and stick them in your freezer. Chop garlic before freezing to make it easier to throw into a dish quickly. Freezing chopped garlic in oil prevents it from freezing solid, which will allow you to scoop only appropriate amounts out when you're ready to use it. Using olive oil can make your garlic last longer than any other oil. [4] X Research source Peel the cloves and purée them. Purée with oil in a blender or food processor using 2 parts oil to 1 part garlic. The puréed garlic will stay soft enough in the freezer to scrape out parts to use in sautéing. Freeze this mixture immediately—do not store it at room temperature."

Simply submerge peeled cloves of garlic in red or white wine vinegar and add a tablespoon of salt for each cup of vinegar you used. If you want, add dried herbs like red pepper flakes or oregano to flavor. The garlic will keep as long as it remains submerged in the vinegar. [7] X Research source"
