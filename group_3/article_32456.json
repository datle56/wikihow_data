      "content": "Set up the credit card company as a payee with your bank. If you use online banking to pay your bills, you can pay the credit card bill through your online account or mobile app. Simply add the name of the credit card company as a payee and include the account number of the person whose bill you want to pay. If you want to pay the person's credit card bill online, this is usually going to be your easiest option. You won't have to ask the person for their login information to access their online credit card account and you won't be accessing their credit card account."

      "title": "Go through the credit card website if you have the cardholder's credentials.",
      "content": "Go through the credit card website if you have the cardholder's credentials. To make a payment directly to the credit card, you'll need the username and password of the person whose bill you're paying. Credit card companies typically won't let you create an account except to pay your own active card. [2] X Research source This usually isn't a viable option unless you're paying the bill of someone you know very well who trusts you with their login information. Even so, you might recommend that they change their password after you've made the payment."

      "content": "Choose your amount and frequency of payment. Use the one-time payment option if you're only making a single payment. Typically, you don't have to save your bank account information in the person's account to do this.

      "content": "Save your payment confirmation for your records. Whether you pay through your bank or through the credit card company's website, you'll typically get a confirmation number. Print that out or write it down so you'll have it in case there's a problem with the payment. You might also want to pass on the confirmation number to the person whose bill you paid. The credit card company likely won't talk to you if there's a problem processing the payment since you aren't an authorized user."

Tell them that you want to pay someone else's credit card bill and they'll let you know what you need to do. [6] X Research source For some cards, you might be able to make a payment using the automated payment system, depending on the information you have for the account and the cardholder.

[11] X Research source If you can't get ahold of the person's statement or you're making the payment as a surprise, check the credit card company's website.

If you write a personal check, make a copy before you mail it. For cashier's checks or money orders, keep the receipt as your record of payment. You might also want to make a copy of the check or money order (or receipt) for the person whose bill you're paying.

Since the account holder's name isn't listed on your check or money order, adding their name is also helpful.

If the person's credit card was issued by a bank, you can typically make credit card payments at any open branch during regular business hours. When you go, make sure you have the person's full name (as it appears on the card) and credit card account number. That should be all you need, but you might want to call ahead and make sure you don't need any additional information. Some credit card companies don't have physical locations where you can pay the bill in person. In these situations, check the company's website to see if they have partnered with other companies, such as Western Union, to accept in-person payments. [14] X Research source The website will give you information to include with your payment to make sure it's credited correctly. [15] X Research source"

It's also usually a good idea to have an amount in mind that you want to pay. The teller likely won't be able to give you any information about the account for privacy reasons. For example, it might not be possible to walk in and pay the balance in full unless you know the amount of the balance. The teller typically can't release that information unless you're listed as an authorized user on the account. It helps if you have a copy of the person's most recent statement since it will have most of the information the teller needs to complete the transaction."

Typically the teller will automatically give you a receipt for your payment. Ask for 2 copies so you have one for your records and another to give the person whose bill you paid. If you planned the payment as a surprise, hold their copy until they discover their bill has been paid. Then let them have it for their records."
