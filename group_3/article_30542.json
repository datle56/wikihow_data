Measure out your dry ingredient into the 1 / 4 cup, along with the 1 / 2 cup. If you don’t feel like using two different measuring cups, just fill and dump the 1 / 4 cup three times. [1] X Research source Did you know? Larger measuring cup sets come with a 3 / 4 cup, or you can buy 3 / 4 measuring cups individually."

Use these spoons to scoop out 12 even tablespoons (or 36 teaspoons) of the ingredient to measure the necessary amount. It may also help to think of a 3 / 4 cup as 1 / 2 with 2 tbsp added in.

[3] X Research source In other words, any container that holds exactly 6 fl oz (180 mL) can help you measure wet ingredients and dry ingredients (without the need for a measuring cup). Here are some household items that might fit the bill: A small mason jar (some mason jars also come with measurement notches) Small food canisters Small leftover cans A laboratory beaker Pro tip: Only have larger cans on hand? Fill up an 8 fl oz (mL) can 75% of the way full, and fill up a 12 fl oz (mL) can so it’s only half full. Keep in mind, though, that this isn’t the most accurate way to weigh out your measurements."

      "content": "Use a kitchen scale to measure the precise weights of ingredients. Does your recipe provide ingredient amounts in ounces or grams? If so, spoon your ingredient into a cup that’s placed on your scale to see if you’ve measured out the precise amount. Always make sure to weigh your measuring tool on the scale first before adding in any ingredients, so you can subtract the tool’s weight from the total.

This helps prevent the ingredient from getting packed down. [5] X Research source For more precise results, place your measuring cup on a food scale to double-check the weight of each dry ingredient."

Stop pouring when the liquid reaches the ¾ line; then, bend down and take a closer look. The upper, uneven surface of your measured is liquid is known as the meniscus —for your liquid measurements to be accurate, the bottom of this meniscus needs to line up with the 3 / 4 or 180 mL line. [6] X Research source It might seem like a tiny bit of liquid is going over the line, which is totally normal!"
