      "content": "Go when crowds are smaller but events are happening. Disney World events and hours vary from season to season and day to day. Planning your trip around special events and extended hours is an excellent way to enhance your magical experience. Consult one of several unofficial Disney Crowd Level Charts online for information on how different special events and holidays impact crowd levels. Avoid the biggest crowds and save some money by scheduling your Disney World vacation during the offseason: mid-January to mid-March, excluding Presidents Day Weekend; mid-April to mid-May, excluding Spring Break; mid-September to mid-November, excluding Halloween weekend. The parks are also less busy Tuesday through Thursday. [1] X Research source"

Purchasing a vacation package can ease the stress of planning a vacation. Compare the costs and perks of a variety of packages in your price range. [2] X Research source Disney employs travel agents that are available to assist you. The phone number for this service is 407-939-5277 (U.S.). [3] X Research source You may (or may not) save money by booking an all-in-one vacation package; you'll definitely save time. Decide how you’d like to experience Disney—value, moderate or deluxe— and look for a travel agent that can put together a trip for you, making sure they know which are your and your family’s favorite characters or franchises."

You may stay at the campground or book a deluxe villa. Staying at a Disney Resort also grants you several privileges: Disney resort guests receive free transportation to and from the airport. If you drive in, you will have the luxury of parking for free. You will also have the ability to enter the park early and stay after regular hours. [4] X Research source"

Begin your search for flights 6 months in advance. If you intend to visit Disney over a school vacation or holiday, it is especially important that you book your flights early. Search for flights every day. Use online tools to find deals on flights. Consider flying in or out on a Tuesday, Wednesday, or Saturday.

Ideally, Disney wants you to land at Orlando's airport, take their shuttle right to your Disney resort, and stay within the Disney World complex for the entire vacation. But, you can escape Mickey's grasp from time to time if you prefer. For budget-conscious Disney vacationers, driving is often the most cost-effective option. In addition to saving money, road-tripping to Disney is an excellent way to see America. If you are flying and not staying at a Disney resort, you will need to rent a vehicle. [6] X Research source Off-site hotels are inexpensive alternatives to the Disney resorts. They are ideal for couples and families vacationing on a budget. If you are vacationing at Disney with a large group, consider booking a local timeshare or vacation home. [7] X Research source"

Once you've created your list of “must see”/“do” items, organize them by date, time, and location so you won't be racing back and forth across a Disney park (or, even worse, shuttling between parks) to get from a character dinner to a fireworks show. For instance, if the Magic Kingdom has a parade at 5:00 pm and fireworks at 9:00 pm (and both are on your list), see if you can squeeze in a “must do” character dinner and a few high-priority rides in the vicinity. Even if you do end up buying “Park Hopper” tickets so you can visit multiple parks in a single day, limiting travel between parks whenever possible will make your day that much less hectic and tiring."

If you schedule each day down to the minute for several days, you'll definitely “hit the wall” by the third or fourth day — and probably sooner if you have small children! For every two (or possibly three) fully-scheduled park days, set aside a non-park day with no set times or plans. It is supposed to be a vacation, after all! [14] X Research source You'll find plenty to do at your lodging resort, especially if it's a Disney property. You can hit the pool(s), play games, shop, or just sleep! If you can't stand just hanging around the pool all day, head over to Disney Springs on your “free day” — it's full of shopping, dining, and activity options. [15] X Research source"

If you're an in-shape pair of twenty something honeymooning at Disney World, you might be able to hoof it across the parks at a fast pace for several days straight. But, most traveling parties need to be realistic about how quickly they can go and how long they can keep up the pace. You can easily walk several miles during a day at a Disney park, and stand for several hours when you aren't walking. If your kids can still fit in the seat, bring (or rent) strollers, even if they don't use them anymore at home. Worn-out five-year olds equals cranky preschoolers equals a less than “magical” day. [16] X Research source Likewise, if you're traveling with anyone with any type of mobility limitation, check into getting a wheelchair or motorized scooter — even if they usually don't use one at home.
