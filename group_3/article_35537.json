      "title": "Let yourself feel.",
      "content": "Let yourself feel. It’s normal to experience strong emotions after a friend attempts suicide. It can be very devastating and even traumatic for you to find out that your friend tried to end their life. Allow yourself to experience and process these emotions. Talk to another trusted friend who may also be experiencing what you’re going through, or consider going to a mental health professional. Some normal reactions include: Anger or “How could they do this?” Guilt or “I should have done more to help them.” Fear or “What if they try again?” Avoidance or “I can’t deal with this right now.” Minimizing or “They didn’t really mean it. They’re just trying to get attention.”"

      "title": "Seek support.",
      "content": "Seek support. It’s important you get support for your emotions from loved ones, friends, a professional, your church, a support group, or blogs and literature. Although it may be difficult to understand or talk about your friend’s actions, you’ll need someone (aside from that friend) who you can be open with on how their actions affected you. It’s especially important you seek support if you continue to remain friends and help them through recovering from their suicide attempt.

      "title": "Recognize what you can do.",
      "content": "Recognize what you can do. You can’t do everything for your friend or change what happened. You can’t cure them, force them to get help, or fully protect them from attempting suicide again. It is normal to feel helpless and to blame yourself, but remember that you are not responsible for their happiness. Forgive yourself for these limitations and focus on what you can do instead. You can: [2] X Research source Listen. Remove unsafe objects and weapons from their home. Involve other friends and family members for help. Allow yourself a break-to eat, to go to the bathroom, to rest-you’re only human."

      "title": "Take care of your body.",
      "content": "Take care of your body. Just as you should seek support and take care of your emotional health, make sure you also focus on your own physical health. In the next few months as you spend more time taking care of your friend, you may forget to take care of yourself, especially if you have other responsibilities like work, school, or family. Take time for yourself to: Exercise on a daily basis, or at least a few times per week. Eat healthy and regular meals and snacks. Get adequate sleep, at least 7-9 hours per night."

      "content": "Remember your own happiness. Don’t lose yourself in your friend’s mental health problems. It’s going to likely be a long and difficult journey ahead for them. Making sure you take time to fulfill your own needs for fun, play, and happiness will help you be better able to help your friend in the long run. Do whatever you need to do to be happy, whether that’s spending time with friends, going to the movies, painting, writing, or listening to music."

      "content": "Avoid reacting negatively. Remember that even though you’re feeling very emotional right now, your friend is probably feeling worse and needs your support now more than ever. Avoid shaming them and making them feel worse about the suicide attempt. Don’t do any of the following: Lecture them. Panic. Try to fix them. Abandon them. Make them feel guilty."

      "title": "Be supportive.",
      "content": "Be supportive. Even though you’re feeling overwhelmed yourself, try your best to be supportive of your friend during this time. You might not know what to say exactly, but let them know they’re safe with you, can be honest with you, and will be supported by you. You can say: “I know this is really hard for you, but remember I’m here for you.” “I want to be here for you and help you. Tell me what you need from me.”"

      "content": "Encourage them to get help. Remember that you, other friends, and family members are no substitute for professional help after a suicide attempt. For the most part you’ll want them to take responsibility for their continuing care after a suicide attempt. However, you should still be supportive, encouraging, and involved if they’re motivated to get help. You could: Help them to find a good counselor. Provide them with a number for a suicide hotline. Help them keep track of their medications. Volunteer to drive them to counseling appointments."

You can encourage healthy, supportive social interaction by getting them out of their house and scheduling activities with other friends."
