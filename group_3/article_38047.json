You can also try \"right-clicking\" the picture by pressing your Mac's trackpad button with two fingers, or by pressing the right side of the trackpad button on some MacBooks."

This will prompt the photo to download immediately into your Mac's \"Downloads\" folder, which is usually a folder literally named \"Downloads\". If you're using a browser other than Safari, you can click Save Image As instead. This option will allow you to select a name and a specific download location for the file before you download it. You can open the \"Downloads\" folder by opening Finder (the blue, face-shaped app icon) and then clicking Downloads on the left side of the window. If you set your Mac's default \"Downloads\" folder to a different folder (e.g., the \"Desktop\" folder), you'll find the image there instead."
