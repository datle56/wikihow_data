      "title": "It’s not your job to carry someone else’s negativity.",
      "content": "It’s not your job to carry someone else’s negativity. Instead, make a conscious effort to think hopeful, grateful, and positive thoughts. Focus on looking for the good in every situation, instead of dwelling on someone else’s misery and negativity. Remember: at the end of the day, you are only responsible for yourself and your own happiness, and not anyone else’s. [2] X Research source Instead of thinking, “I always feel awful after talking with Jen,” think something like “Jen may not be fun to talk to, but I won’t let that conversation ruin my day.” You might also think “Today is going to be a great day” or “I know that no matter what happens today, my friends and family have my back.”"

      "title": "Your time and energy are just as valuable as anyone else’s.",
      "content": "Your time and energy are just as valuable as anyone else’s. You don’t owe anyone your time and conversation, especially energy vampires. If you’re sensing someone else’s bad vibes, feel free to leave the area—your mental health and wellbeing are most important! [3] X Research source For example, if someone like your roommate is an energy vampire, spend as little time around them as you possibly can."

      "title": "Boundaries are a polite, effective way to block off negative energy.",
      "content": "Boundaries are a polite, effective way to block off negative energy. Let your peers, co-workers, relatives, friends, and acquaintances know what your limits are. Tell an energy vampire that you’re feeling tired, or that you’re preoccupied with something else at the moment. If you have to spend time with a negative person, like a relative, set firm start and end times for your meet-up. [4] X Research source You might say, “Sorry, I can’t talk right now. I’m behind on some assignments” or “I didn’t get a lot of sleep last night, so I’m not up for a long chat right now.” You might agree to have lunch with a toxic friend or relative for 1 hour instead of leaving the outing open-ended."

      "title": "It’s okay to call a negative person out on their negativity.",
      "content": "It’s okay to call a negative person out on their negativity. Listening to the constant complaints and gripe of a friend, relative, co-worker, or acquaintance is exhausting, and not your responsibility. Instead of letting them go on and on, challenge their bad attitude. Invite them to look for solutions instead of dwelling on the past. You might say, “I’m sorry you’re feeling frustrated, but complaining isn’t going to solve anything.” You could also say, “I’m sorry you’re having a rough day, but I have a lot of work to do and don’t have time to sit here with you.”"

      "title": "Make an active choice to stay away from negative people.",
      "content": "Make an active choice to stay away from negative people. This may seem easier said than done, but it’s not as hard as you may think. Before going to school, work, or any other place, make a vow that you won’t talk or interact with any negative people. This way, you’ll be completely protected from their negative vibes. [5] X Research source For instance, you might take a different route to class so you don’t bump into a toxic, constantly complaining peer. You could sit or work further away from a negative colleague so you won’t be distracted at work. It’s not always possible to avoid negative people, but you can still try to keep your distance."

      "content": "Embracing positive energy is just as important as expelling negative energy. Whenever you can, spend lots of time hanging out with encouraging and supportive friends. Positive energy is one of the best ways to protect yourself from negative energy! After a tough day at work, you might go out for drinks with some friends. Good friends won’t judge you and will support you unconditionally. You’ll feel happy and content when you’re around them, instead of emotionally drained. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Getting stressed and upset won’t get rid of the negativity. Instead, do your best to stay calm around negative, energy-draining people, even if it’s really challenging. If you get upset, the negative person will probably get upset too, which won’t make anything better. Staying calm and collected is a simple but effective way to protect yourself from negative energy. [7] X Research source For example, you might take a deep breath or excuse yourself from the room."

      "content": "At the end of the day, you can only control yourself. Chances are, perpetually negative people don’t want to be fixed, and will continue to act up in the future. Instead of helping the negative person, put your own mental and emotional health first by keeping a safe distance. [8] X Research source"
