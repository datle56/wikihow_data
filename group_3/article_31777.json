      "content": "Use the Ruy Lopez opening to free up your bishop and knight. Start by advancing your king’s pawn 2 spaces forward to the e4 square to take control of the center. In the mainline variant, your opponent will mirror your play and move to e5. Develop your king’s knight to the f3 space to put pressure on your opponent’s pawn. Your opponent will usually move their queen’s knight to c6 in response. Then, move your king’s bishop diagonally to b5 so you can attack the knight next turn. [1] X Research source Pawns can only advance 2 spaces the first time they move. Development refers to moving your more powerful pieces out from the back row and toward the center of the board. This opening allows you to easily maneuver across the board while freeing up the space between your rook and king so you can castle, which is when you move your king next to your rook and then put the rook on the opposite side. This helps protect your king."

      "content": "Open with the Fried Liver Attack line to draw out your opponent’s king. Start by moving your pawn to e4 and allow your opponent to advance their pawn to e5. Position your knight on f3 so your opponent moves their knight to c6. Then, develop your bishop to c4 to put pressure on your opponent’s king’s side. Your opponent will usually bring their other knight to f6 so you can move your knight to g5. Your opponent will typically advance their queen’s pawn to d5 so you can capture it with your pawn. Next, your opponent will capture your pawn with their knight, but you can capture f7 with your knight. [2] X Research source After that, your opponent will need to move their king to f7 to capture your knight, which will prevent them from building a strong defense. However, you will lose 1 knight early in the game."

Your opponent will typically mirror your movement and advance their pawn to d5. Bring your king’s knight to f3 to protect your pawn and control the e5 square. Your opponent will mirror your move and develop their knight to f6. Then, move your queen’s bishop to f4 so you have additional control over the board. [3] X Research source"

Your opponent will usually move their queen’s pawn to d5 in response. Then, move your pawn to c4 to put pressure on the pawn. Your opponent will usually capture the pawn on c4, but that’s okay. Advance your king’s pawn forward to e3 to free up your bishop. Your opponent will typically develop their knight to f6 so you can capture their pawn with your bishop.

If your opponent moves a pawn to e5, then develop another pawn to f4 to put pressure on your opponent. Typically, your opponent will capture the pawn on f4 to “accept” the gambit.

Your opponent will typically respond by developing their knight to f3. Move your queen’s pawn forward 1 space to d6 for control over the e5 space. If the white player advances their pawn to d4, capture it with the pawn from c5. Even though your opponent will probably capture your pawn with their knight, you still have good control over the board.

Rather than mirroring their play, develop your knight to f6 so you can potentially capture on d5 and e4. If your opponent follows up by moving a pawn to c4, advance your king’s pawn to e6 to free up your bishop. When your opponent develops their knight to c3, move your king’s bishop to b4 to put pressure on your opponent’s pieces. [7] X Research source Leave your king’s rook and king in their starting squares so you can castle. If your opponent attacks your bishop on a3 with a pawn, capture their knight on c3 to put them in check, which means you can capture their king on your next turn. They will capture your bishop during their turn with a pawn, but the pawn will be stuck behind another one of their other pawns and won’t be able to move freely."

Your opponent will usually respond by advancing their queen’s pawn to d4 so they have more control of the center. Mirror their play and move your pawn to the d5 square. While your opponent may be tempted to capture your pawn, you’ll be able to retake it right away.

      "content": "Try the Caro-Kann Defense to set up a strong pawn structure for the late game. Much like the Sicilian Defense, if your opponent opens by moving a pawn to e4, position one of your pawns in c6 to put some pressure on the d5 space. If your opponent follows up by moving a pawn to d4, respond by advancing a pawn to d5. The white player will typically move their knight to c3 for added defense. You can respond by capturing the pawn on e4 so you regain control of the center. [9] X Research source The diagonal wall of pawns on the queen’s side will help protect you later in the game and it frees up your bishop to attack the king’s side."

Try to move either your king or queen’s pawn into the center and set up your other pieces so they can capture on those squares. The longer that you can maintain control of the center, the more likely you are to win the entire game.

Rather than trying to move all of your pawns right away, bring out at least 1 bishop and knight from the back row so they’re closer to the middle of the board. This helps you gain mobility around the board and puts more pressure on your opponent’s pieces. [13] X Research source Remember, knights can jump over other pieces so you can advance them without moving a pawn out of the way."

      "content": "Try to move different pieces with each turn. While you’re moving the same piece, your opponent may develop more of their pieces to the center and take control of the board. As you start your game, switch between which pieces you move until you have a strong board presence. Get as many pieces off of their starting squares as you can so it’s easier for you to get around the board. [14] X Research source If you can capture an enemy piece other than a pawn, it’s okay to use a piece you already moved. Otherwise, you can continue developing other pieces."

Keep your queen near the back row and protected by your other pieces so it doesn’t get attacked right away. That way, you can use it during the endgame to maneuver around the board quickly and put pressure on a lot of squares. [15] X Research source"

Try to clear out all the pieces between one of your rooks and your king within the first few turns of the game. As long as you haven’t moved your king or rook, you can slide the king so it’s in the square next to your rook. Then lift up your rook and put it on the opposite side of the king so your king is protected in the corner. This will make it more difficult for your opponent to attack. [17] X Research source You can castle with either the king’s or queen’s rook. Even though you’re moving 2 pieces, castling still only counts as 1 turn."
