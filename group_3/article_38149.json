      "content": "Greet people with the title that matches their gender. Spanish is a very gender-based language, so the titles you use will change depending on someone’s gender. Typically, terms addressing or describing males end with -e or -o, while terms addressing females end with -a.

Gender-neutral terms are yet to be officially accepted by the official Spanish-language dictionary. However, native Spanish speakers in Latin America commonly use -e as the neutral ending for Spanish words. [5] X Research source For example, you could replace the gendered title maestr o (“male teacher”) or maestr a (“female teacher”) with maestr e ."
