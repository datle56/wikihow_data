      "content": "Rozane wafer mark (from 1905) One of the earliest marks used by Roseville Pottery was the die-impressed Rozane mark, introduced around 1905. This mark features the phrase “Rozane Ware” in a circle and sometimes includes the name of the pottery line beneath it.

      "content": "Rv ink stamp (from 1923) In 1923, Roseville began using the blue ink stamp Rv mark. This mark is stamped onto the bottom of a piece in blue ink and features a small “v” tucked inside an uppercase “R.” [2] X Research source Lines with this mark: Roseville Carnelian, Rosecraft Panel, Rosecraft Hexagon, Rosecraft Vintage, and Mostique."

      "content": "Paper or foil label (1927-1935) From 1927 to 1935, Roseville patterns were only marked with a paper or foil label that sometimes included the corresponding shape number and size. [3] X Research source Gray and black paper labels were introduced around 1927, and silver and gold foil labels were introduced in 1933. Lines with this mark: Baneda, Blackberry, Cherry Blossom, Falline, Futura, Jonquil, Monticello, and Sunflower. One of the most common labels from this time frame was shield-shaped with a black and silver legend of “ROSEVILLE POTTERY.” Note that pottery produced between 1927 and 1935 was not marked with any of the Roseville stamped trademarks introduced after 1936."

      "title": "Die-impressed trademark (from 1936)",
      "content": "Die-impressed trademark (from 1936) In 1936, Roseville began using a die-impressed “Roseville” trademark with a corresponding shape number and size. These marks varied from piece to piece at first, and in 1940, Roseville began marking pieces with a raised “Roseville U.S.A.” mark featuring the corresponding shape number and size. [4] X Research source The size is expressed in inches. For example, a Roseville Lotus vase that is in the L4 shape and stands 10 inches tall would be marked as “Lotus L4-10”.” Roseville patterns that were produced over many years, such as the Pinecone, use several different pottery marks and often confuse collectors because of it."

      "title": "Pre-1905 marks",
      "content": "Pre-1905 marks It’s important to note that not all authentic Roseville pieces will have a mark and that some earlier pieces (before 1905) may feature random or less common marks. [5] X Research source Here are a few early marks to be on the lookout for: Vase assortment/Victorian (1896-1900): The shape number is impressed in the mold in an old-style cursive. Scroll label (1896-1900): Shaped like a scroll, this paper label has occasionally been found on Vase Assortment products from 1896-1900 and is initialed with “RP Co.” Rectangle label (1900-1904): This early rectangle-shaped paper label is sometimes found on Majolica jardinieres and lists the number, size, and price of the piece. Rozane stamped (1900-1904): Pre-1905 Rozane brown-ware featured a stamped “Rozane PRCo” mark. Azurean mark (1903-1904): Azurean pieces were typically marked as both Azurean and Rozane with the shape number stamped on the base. Chloron cursive ink (1905): Before the Rozane wafer mark was introduced, some Chloron pieces featured the work “Chloron” inked onto the bottom of the base in cursive."

      "title": "Research the supply and demand.",
      "content": "Research the supply and demand. Demand is the most important factor when determining the value of a Roseville piece. The more sought-after a piece is, the more money it’s worth. Both supply and demand varies depending on the line, color, form, and how trends change over the years. If you’re not sure what a piece is worth, look at recent auction house sales records, check collectors’ forums, and talk with appraisers and collectors to determine how to price it . [6] X Research source Remember, value can change over time. Something that would go for $500 a few years ago may now only be worth $200, for example. Because Roseville is no longer produced, there is a limited supply of pieces. Many were also broken and discarded or are tied up in collections. While the rarity is often directly correlated with demand, it isn’t always, so some rare pieces may not actually go for that much. Some lines are in greater demand than others, like Pinecone. Some colors within that line may also be in higher demand. For example, blue Pinecone pieces typically have a higher resale value than green Pinecone pieces. For example, an Apple Blossom basket in excellent condition may only go for around $120, while a Baneda vase in excellent condition may go for $650. Trial vases may go for even more—the Roseville Primrose Experimental Trial Glaze 1936 is listed at $5665 online. [7] X Research source"

      "title": "Ensure the piece is in good condition.",
      "content": "Ensure the piece is in good condition. It may sound obvious, but pottery in good condition is usually worth more than damaged or broken pieces. Depending on the rarity, having it professionally restored can increase the value of a damaged piece to about 50-90% of a mint item. If the piece isn’t in high demand, however, it may not be worth the cost of restoration. [8] X Research source The restoration price depends on a number of factors, like how damaged the piece is and where you take it to get restored. In some cases, repairing ceramic may cost between $400-750. [9] X Research source The price of a mint item depends on which line it’s from. Pieces with little demand may go for just over $100, while rare pieces may go for thousands. Check with an appraiser or look at what similar pieces have sold for in auctions or on sites like eBay."

      "content": "Check the production quality. This includes factors like molding, color/glazing, and factory flaws. Pieces with sharp, well-defined molding tend to look better than those with worn molds and may be worth more money. Some collectors may prefer more intense colors, as well.

Often, fake Roseville pieces have “Roseville” or “Roseville U.S.A.” printed on the bottom, even if the original piece had a different mark or no mark at all. Alternatively, pieces that are meant to say “Roseville U.S.A.” often just say “Roseville,” as the reproductions are made overseas. Be sure to check which line the piece is a part of to determine what its mark should look like. [11] X Research source"

      "title": "Check the quality of the glaze.",
      "content": "Check the quality of the glaze. Roseville Pottery was known for its meticulously applied glaze. Examine the piece for any drips or smears or a particularly dull or flat glaze. Additionally, real Roseville pieces were glazed entirely; if the inside isn’t glazed, it’s a good sign the piece is a fake. [12] X Research source"

      "content": "Feel the weight of the piece. Authentic Roseville pottery is made with denser clay than most of its imitators.

      "content": "Look at the quality and color of the design’s details. True Roseville pottery has beautiful details that are sharp and clear, as well as subdued but glowing colors. If the details seem vague or dull or the color either too bright or too muddy, the piece might be fake. Because these details vary from piece to piece, it’s a good idea to compare the piece in question to images of authentic ones. [14] X Research source"

      "content": "Determine if the price is too low. Usually, if something sounds too good to be true, it probably is. When looking for authentic Roseville pottery, check online or with an appraiser to determine a piece’s average value. If you find a piece being sold for way under this price, it’s probably fake or at least damaged. [15] X Research source For example, if you find a piece being sold for under $50 at an antique store or by an antique dealer, it’s unlikely to be authentic. If it is true Roseville, it probably has significant damage, so be sure to ask as many questions as possible before you consider buying. While the average asking price will vary depending on the piece and the line it’s a part of, authentic Roseville pottery will rarely sell for under $100. Usually, pieces on the lower end sell closer to the $200-250 range. [16] X Research source"

      "content": "In the early 1910s, Roseville started producing commercial pottery. In the early 1910s, the demand for expensive, hand-crafted pottery declined, so Roseville shifted their production to more commercially produced pieces. This switch allowed them to continually produce popular patterns and styles more easily than their competitors, as by 1915, Roseville was using assembly-line decorating and firing.
