      "content": "Craft a unique greeting based on the person’s age and experiences. Take into consideration any milestones that have happened in the past year and incorporate those into your birthday greeting. Acknowledge what the person has accomplished to show that you are invested in their life. For example, you could say something like, “This past year you succeeded at starting your own business, and I look forward to seeing all that you accomplish in the year to come. Happy birthday!” Examples of milestones include learning how to drive, graduating from high school or a higher education program, buying a home, growing a family, getting a new job, getting married, moving, starting a new business, and meeting a personal goal, like running a marathon or reading 50 books in a year."

      "content": "Write out a personal message for a more specific birthday wish. Get a birthday card or stationery and sit down for 10 minutes and write a short letter to your friend or family member. Think about the ways in which they have positively impacted your life, what makes them special, and what you hope will be true for them in the coming year. Taking the time to handwrite a message is a gift in and of itself. Most communication happens quickly via the Internet or the phone, so a handwritten note will be something the birthday person can hold onto for a long time."

      "content": "Express gratitude if you're wishing your parent a happy birthday. Take time to either call or see your parent in person on their birthday to give them a warm birthday wish. Express your gratitude for their role in your life and be sincere in what you say. If you have a strained relationship with a parent, it’s okay—try to remember that you have them and that their birthday is a special opportunity to say “Thank you” or simply, “Happy birthday.” You can say something like, “Words just don’t come close to saying how thankful I am that you’re my parent. Happy birthday!” Or try something like, “I know who I am today is because of who you have been in my life, thank you—and I hope you have the happiest birthday!” If you have a parent who has passed, their birthday can be a painful reminder of that loss. You can take time to remember them, visit a spot that was special to them, or look at old photographs to honor their memory."

When cards get passed around at work for everyone to sign, take a minute to write out something a little longer than just “Happy birthday.” Depending on how well you know the person, you could write something like “All the best in the year to come” or something more personal like “Looking forward to working on more projects together in the next year.” Make sure to sign your name beneath your greeting to make it more personal."

      "content": "Buy or make a card for their birthday. Search for a card that reminds you of the birthday person, or get creative and design a card either by hand or on the computer. Write a personal message inside the card, rather than simply signing it. [3] X Research source If you don’t plan on seeing the person on or near their birthday, mail the card a few days before the date so they will have it in time. Sending a card is a great way to show you care because it takes time to purchase or make a card."

[5] X Research source You can find out where the person will be by asking something simple, like “Do you have any plans for the week of your birthday? I know I usually take my birthday off and spend it at home.” This will start a conversation where they can tell you if they plan on doing anything out of the ordinary. Make sure to include a note with the flowers/gift basket that includes your name. The website or person taking your order will ask you what you would like the note to say. You could even arrange to have their favorite take-out meal delivered to them for a special birthday treat."
