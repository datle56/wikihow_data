If you're not signed in, you'll be prompted to log in now . The Advanced Search form isn't available in the X mobile app. But don't worry—if you're using an Android, iPhone, or iPad, you can still use this method to access the form in your mobile web browser. If you're using a mobile web browser, you may not see the Advanced Search form right after signing in. If you're brought to your feed instead, go to https://twitter.com/search-advanced again to pull up the form."

The \"Words\" section at the top lets you search for tweets from that user that include (or don't include) certain words and phrases. This section is great when you need to find tweets about certain subjects. For example, if you wanted to search all of @wikiHow's tweets for mentions of pizza, you could type pizza into the \"All of these words\" field. Or, you could type pizza pasta marinara into the \"Any of these words\" field to find any of @wikiHow's tweets that contain any of those words. And if you didn't want any of those results to include the word \"lasagna,\" you could add lasagna to the \"None of these words\" field. [2] X Research source The \"Filters\" section lets you choose whether to include replies in addition to original posts, as well as tweets with links. The \"Engagements\" section lets you choose whether to see tweets with specific amounts of likes, replies, and retweets. Use the \"Dates\" section to view tweets from a specific date range."

Replace the smiley with a sad face :( to see just the tweets that X thinks indicate a negative attitude."
