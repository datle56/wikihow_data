      "content": "Understand how Super Mario Odyssey differs from various classic Mario games. While classic Mario games are side-scrollers, Super Mario Odyssey allows you to move Mario in a full 3D world. This means that it controls much more like a traditionally third-person game (such as The Division or Crash Bandicoot) than a third-person side-scroller."
