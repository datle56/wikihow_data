[9] X Research source For example, if he asks you to tell him what you're wearing, say, \"My favorite old sweatshirt and a pair of jeans,\" instead of playing along and saying something sexy. This also lets him see that you have boundaries and you don't like being pushed. He should respect that and adjust his text messages to make you more comfortable.
