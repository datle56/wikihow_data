      "title": "Remove the anodization if you like the look of unfinished metal.",
      "content": "Remove the anodization if you like the look of unfinished metal. Anodized metals are stronger and more resilient than their unfinished counterparts. Stripping anodization requires the use of a caustic chemical and it will undoubtedly weaken the metal surface. With this in mind, the only reason to strip anodization is if you like the look of bare metal. Unless you love the way bare metal looks, there’s no real reason to do this. [1] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source If you’re stripping the anodization on a screw, bearing, nut, or computer part, recognize that there’s probably a reason the part was anodized in the first place. Unless the object is purely ornamental, you’re probably better off leaving it the way it is."

      "content": "Put on some rubber gloves, a dust mask, and protective eyewear. You cannot remove anodization without using a caustic chemical, so get some thick rubber gloves to protect your hands. Put on a dust mask or respirator to protect your lungs. Wear some protective eyewear to protect your eyes from splashes and fumes. [2] X Research source Do this outside if you can. If you want to do this indoors, do it near an open window and turn a fan on."

      "title": "Get a liquid rust remover or oven cleaner.",
      "content": "Get a liquid rust remover or oven cleaner. Any cleaner that lists hydrochloric or sulfamic acid as an ingredient can be used to remove anodization. The two most common household cleaners that contain these ingredients are rust removers and oven cleaners. If you don’t have one of these at home, pick one up at your local cleaning supply store. [3] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Fill a bowl or cup with your cleaning agent.",
      "content": "Fill a bowl or cup with your cleaning agent. Get a large glass or plastic bowl that is bigger than the object you’re stripping. You can use a glass if your metal object is small enough to fit inside. Pour your oven cleaner or rust remover into the bowl or glass. Fill it with enough liquid to completely submerge your object. [4] X Research source if you’re using an aerosol cleaner, spray the bottom of the glass or bowl with a thin layer of your oven cleaner or rust remover."
    },
    {
      "title": "Disassemble your object or remove any pieces you want to keep clean.",
      "content": "Disassemble your object or remove any pieces you want to keep clean. If your anodized object is attached to a larger item, like a screw in a computer, take it out. Remove any washers, rubber pieces, or fasteners that don’t need to be stripped. If the anodized object can be disassembled, like a small toy, take it apart the best that you can. The cleaner will not work its way into airtight surfaces and it may destroy non-metal objects, so remove non-anodized pieces or take your object apart if possible. [5] X Research source If you don’t need to disassemble anything, go ahead and skip this step. If your anodized surface is attached to another item and you cannot remove it, there’s no consistent way to strip the anodization without damaging the object that it’s attached to. You can try wiping the surface with a towel soaked in your cleaner, but you’re highly likely to damage the surface around the anodized metal."

      "title": "Drop your anodized object gently into the bowl or cup.",
      "content": "Drop your anodized object gently into the bowl or cup. Hold your anodized item 1–3 inches (2.5–7.6 cm) above the surface of your bowl or cup. Gently lower the object and release it into the liquid. Move your hands away from the bowl or cup quickly to avoid any splashes from getting on to your skin. [6] X Research source If you’re using an aerosol stripping agent, hold the nozzle 6–8 inches (15–20 cm) away from the surface of the object and spray it until the object is completely covered in the cleaner."

    {
      "title": "Let the object soak for 15-30 minutes to strip the anodization.",
      "content": "Let the object soak for 15-30 minutes to strip the anodization. The acid in the cleaner will automatically begin sizzling as it starts eating away the anodization. Leave the object in the liquid for at least 15 minutes. If the cleaner is clear, you will see the anodization changing the color of the liquid. This is normal, and it isn’t anything to worry about. [7] X Research source You don’t need to mix the stripping agent while your object is submerged. Simply let it be and wait for the anodization to disappear."

    {
      "title": "Remove the object and set it out on a towel to check the color.",
      "content": "Remove the object and set it out on a towel to check the color. With your rubber gloves on, reach into the cleaner and lift the object out. Set it down a clean towel and inspect the metal to see if the color is entirely gone. If the color is completely stripped, the metal is no longer anodized. If there’s still a shade of anodization on the object, drop it back into the cleaner and let it sit for another 15 minutes. [8] X Research source"

      "title": "Rinse the object thoroughly under a steady stream of water.",
      "content": "Rinse the object thoroughly under a steady stream of water. Take your metal object to a nearby sink, or set it down on the sidewalk or grass and grab a hose. Rinse the metal thoroughly with water for 2-3 minutes. Turn the object around in your hands while you’re rinsing it to remove all of the cleaning agent. Let the metal air dry or wipe it clean with a dry towel. [9] X Research source Do not take your gloves off while doing this. Even water-diluted cleaners can still irritate your skin."

      "title": "Pour the excess cleaner out and wash your hands thoroughly.",
      "content": "Pour the excess cleaner out and wash your hands thoroughly. You can pour the oven cleaner or rust remover down the sink if you dilute it with water. Set the bowl or cup in your sink and turn the water on. Fill the bowl and cup with water and pour it down your sink. Keep the water running and rinse your gloves thoroughly under the water to remove the cleaner before taking them off. To finish, wash your hands, glove, and bowl with a dish soap and water. If you want to neutralize the acid on your gloves before removing them, pour baking soda on to your gloves and rub the powder around in the rubber. Then, rinse the baking soda off before removing your gloves. This is really only necessary if you had a spill or splash, though."
