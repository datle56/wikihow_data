This helps prevent \"dead-zones\" in your house where you have weak or no Wi-Fi. Keep in mind that walls and floors can impede a wireless signal and cause connection issues. Avoid putting your wireless router next to metal, concrete, or brick structures."

Then connect it directly to the \"LAN\" or \"Internet\" port on your router. [3] X Research source If you want, you can use your old combination modem/router device as a modem only. To do so, connect a computer to the old modem/router using an ethernet cable. Open a web browser and type the modem's IP address and log in. Look for the “IP Passthrough” settings on the modem's user interface. Switch the “Allocation Mode” settings to Passthrough, and set the “Passthrough Mode” box to “DHCPS-fixed.” Then, type in your new router’s Media Access Control (MAC) address below."

[4] X Research source The default IP address is usually something like \"192.168.1.1,\" \"192.168.0.1,\" or \"10.0.0.1.\" If you can't find your IP address, you find your IP address on Windows and Linux as well as Mac .

If you don't know the password, you can reset the router to it's factory default settings. To do this, locate the reset button on the router and press and hold it for several seconds.
