      "title": "Gather the materials.",
      "content": "Gather the materials. To create a water elevator, you must build columns of Glass to encase the water. Determine how high you want your elevator to be, and then multiply that number by four to find the number of Glass blocks you need. You will need: Glass blocks : Obtained by smelting sand from deserts and beaches in a furnace [1] X Research source . Bucket : Obtained via crafting with three Iron Ingots in a V shape. Fill it with water from an ocean, river, or swamp. Kelp : Found in the ocean. Soul sand : found in Soul Sand Valleys in the Nether and ancient cities underground in the Overworld. Magma block : Found in the Nether and in underwater ravines in the Overworld. Bone meal (Optional): Crafted from bones. Bones can be obtained by killing skeletons or from certain structure chests."

      "title": "Build the glass enclosure.",
      "content": "Build the glass enclosure. Create four columns of glass as high as you'd like. They should be arranged in a rhombus shape, connected diagonally. Be sure to leave a block of space in the middle of the enclosure for the water and a two-block tall space for the elevator's entrance at the bottom. To stop the water from escaping, stand in the middle of the enclosure and place a door, or two signs, in the two-block tall space."

    {
      "title": "Fill the elevator with water.",
      "content": "Fill the elevator with water. You can place the water in the elevator from the top block. It will flow down to fill the remaining space, but the blocks below will be flowing blocks, and you must turn the water into source blocks for the elevator to work. This can be done with kelp."

    {
      "title": "Place kelp in all elevator blocks.",
      "content": "Place kelp in all elevator blocks. Starting from the very bottom of the elevator, place down kelp as you rise to the very top. You can also place kelp on the bottom block and bone meal it to fill the elevator. This will turn all the water blocks into source blocks. You'll also be able to breathe underwater with the help of the bubbles."
    },
    {
      "title": "Destroy the kelp.",
      "content": "Destroy the kelp. Return to the bottom of your elevator and open the door. Destroy the first kelp at the bottom. The rest of the kelp will break."

    {
      "title": "Place a soul sand block at the bottom.",
      "content": "Place a soul sand block at the bottom. This will create an upwards bubble column. If you want players to descend with this elevator, place a magma block instead. You can now use the water elevator. This can help you move around much faster than stairs ."
