      "content": "The Master Number 11 amplifies the characteristics of number 2. The Master Numbers in numerology are 11, 22, and 33. They are much rarer compared to the standard numbers (1 through 9) and bring with them a lot of potential and power. However, along with all of that potential comes a bit of pressure to live up to such high expectations. When the number 11 is reduced (the sum of its two numbers is taken), you’re left with the number 2 (1 + 1 = 2). This means that the Master Number 11 possess the same type of energy as 2, but it manifests itself in a much more powerful way. [1] X Research source For example, people with 2 in their numerology charts are sensitive and affectionate, so people with 11 in their charts may experience these feelings much more strongly and be more influenced by them in their daily life."
