      "title": "He might like you.",
      "content": "He might like you. This could be his way of flirty with you in a goofy way, especially if you’ve just started dating. Maybe he playfully shoves your shoulder while he says it or sends you a “😉” alongside it. Either way, this might be his way of saying “I’m into you” without actually admitting it."

    {
      "title": "He could be undermining your judgment and emotions.",
      "content": "He could be undermining your judgment and emotions. “Crazy” can easily be turned into an insult in an argument, especially if he says it after you’ve expressed an opinion or emotion. It doesn’t matter if he’s your friend, boyfriend, or even your ex. This could be his way of swatting your feelings aside in a casual discussion or an argument. Think about how he said it. Did he scoff and roll his eyes? Did he physically brush past you to avoid the conversation? [1] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "He might be trying to put the blame on you.",
      "content": "He might be trying to put the blame on you. Invalidation could be his motive whether you’re dating or going through a breakup. Maybe you’ve gotten into an argument, and after expressing your feelings or concern, he calls you “crazy.” If you’re in a rocky relationship, this could be his way of making you feel like the one at fault, so you’ll take the blame for everything and fess up for something you didn’t even do."

    {
      "title": "He could be trying to manipulate you.",

    {
      "title": "\"Crazy about you!\"",
      "content": "\"Crazy about you!\" This is a great response if your head-over-heels for him. You’re telling him your behavior is only because you like him without actually telling him you want him! He’s bound to chuckle, and could even blush if you send him a flirty “😉” if you’re texting. Try using another word like “wild” or reframing your response with more details like, “Only because I’m in love with you!”"

    {
      "title": "\"As if you’re not!\"",
      "content": "\"As if you’re not!\" Hit him right back with this playful response. You’re not the only “crazy” one in the relationship!

    },
    {
      "title": "\"But you secretly love it.\"",
      "content": "\"But you secretly love it.\" Give this flirtatious reply if you’re feeling in the mood. Maybe you’re cuddling or texting before an evening date. Either way, this is the perfect response if you want to tell him you’re ready to have fun. Smile flirtatiously at him while you say it, or add a “😏” to give him a nudge."

      "title": "\"I’ll take that as a compliment coming from you.\"",
      "content": "\"I’ll take that as a compliment coming from you.\" Brush him off with this one-line response. Not only is this a dig at him, but it’s also a quick way for you to acknowledge and end the conversation. If he calls you “crazy” in person, simply say this and walk away.

      "title": "\"Takes one to know one.\"",
      "content": "\"Takes one to know one.\" This response is sure to make him quiet. Maybe he said the word as the punchline of a joke or meant it as an insult.

Use this as a last resort. If he’s insulting you, the last thing you want to do is stoop down to his level."
    },
    {
      "title": "\"That’s rather insensitive, don’t you think?\"",
      "content": "\"That’s rather insensitive, don’t you think?\" Call him out on his use of the word “crazy.” This is the perfect response for just about anyone, whether he’s a past friend, ex, or someone just being downright mean. Teach him about why “crazy” can come across as insensitive. Everyone can benefit from a little lesson. If you’re texting, send him links to articles that emphasize the importance of changing your terminology. Who knows? Maybe he’ll start using the word “wild” instead!"
