      "title": "Rinse your hands with water.",
      "content": "Rinse your hands with water. As soon as you notice any silicone caulk on your hands, go to the sink and rinse off your hands with water. While silicone caulk is waterproof when it dries, it takes several minutes to hours for it to cure. So, rinse off your hands as soon as possible to get off most of the caulk. [1] X Trustworthy Source U.S. National Capital Poison Center Independent poison control center providing resources to prevent poisonings and save lives Go to source When caulk is spread thin or in tiny drops on your hands, it typically dries faster. So, it’s important to rinse off your hands as soon as possible. Dried caulk is generally harder to remove than wet caulk, which is another reason why it’s important to act fast."

      "content": "Wipe off leftover caulk with a paper towel. If there are still bits of silicone caulk left on your hands, grab a paper towel or tissue and wipe it off. [2] X Research source Just let the silicone dry and harden on the towel or tissue before you throw it away in your trash can. [3] X Research source Don't use a fabric towel (especially one that you care about) to wipe off the silicone. Once silicone dries, it's very difficult to get out. Additionally, it's basically waterproof, so even if it doesn't ruin your towel's appearance, it may make it less useful."

      "content": "Rub your hands with a plastic grocery bag to remove stubborn caulk. If you’re still dealing with a few stubborn spots of caulk, grab a plastic grocery bag and rub it over your hands like a washcloth. If the silicone is still slightly wet, it will readily transfer and cling to the bag instead of your hands. [4] X Research source If you don't have a grocery bag handy, other plastic bags, like trash can liners, work well. While this trick is a little unconventional, it's cited by many home improvement resources as being effective."

      "title": "Wash and dry your hands.",
      "content": "Wash and dry your hands. To remove any remaining bits of caulk, scrub your hands with hand soap and water. Feel free to scrub with your fingernails, a sponge, a paper towel, or a mild abrasive (like pumice ). Then, dry your hands with a paper towel or old rag. [5] X Research source Examine your hands carefully after drying them to check for any remaining caulk. If you see any remaining caulk on your hands, rub them with the plastic bag again and wash them. You may need to repeat this a few times to get off all the caulk. If the caulk won’t come off of your hands, it’s likely dried. Luckily, we have a list of different methods below to help remove dried caulk from your hands."

      "content": "Pick off dried pieces of silicone caulk with your fingers. If there are any large pieces of caulk on your hands, simply use your fingers to scrape them off. You might not be able to get every bit of caulk off, but removing the large pieces can help make the other removal methods below more effective."

      "title": "Scrub your hands with soap, water, and an abrasive, like pumice.",
      "content": "Scrub your hands with soap, water, and an abrasive, like pumice . Another way to get dried silicone caulk off your hands is to scrub them. Start by lathering your hands with soap and water. Then, use a mild abrasive, like a pumice stone, kitchen sponge, or piece of fine-grit sandpaper , to gently rub off the caulk. Alternatively, use a pumice soap to scrub your hands. Be very gentle with the abrasive to avoid rubbing your skin raw. Use a light touch and stop scrubbing if your hands start to feel irritated or sore. Remember, the caulk will eventually fall off on its own, so there's no reason to hurt yourself trying to get it off. Do not use a harsh abrasive, like steel wool, to remove the caulk; it can be too tough on your skin."

      "content": "Rub your hands with butter and baking soda. Cut off a few slabs of butter and work them into your hands until they’re evenly coated. Then, pour a heaping spoon of baking soda into your hands. Simply rub the baking soda into your hands to lift off the caulk. [6] X Research source Once all the caulk is gone, wash and dry your hands. The butter helps loosen the caulk while the abrasive baking soda scrubs it off."

      "content": "Dab the dried caulk with rubbing alcohol. Rubbing alcohol is a mild solvent that can dissolve sticky residue like silicone caulk. Simply soak a cotton ball with rubbing alcohol and dab it into the caulk on your hands. It may take a few applications to remove it all. [7] X Research source Wash, dry, and moisturize your hands once all of the caulk is gone. Alternatively, use an alcohol, like vodka, in place of rubbing alcohol."

      "content": "Apply acetone-based nail polish remover onto the caulk. Acetone, an organic chemical that’s frequently used in nail polish removers, can dissolve some plastics with ease (like acrylic nail polish). Just soak a cotton ball or paper towel with an acetone-based nail polish remover. Then, gently wet and dab the caulk spots on your hands until they’re gone. [9] X Research source Wash, dry, and moisturize your hands once you’re done. Don't pour the acetone all over your hands. Acetone-based nail polish remover can be tough on your skin and dry it out. It can also produce unpleasant fumes. Check the label on your bottle of nail polish to ensure it contains acetone."

      "title": "Cautiously heat the caulk with a hair dryer.",
      "content": "Cautiously heat the caulk with a hair dryer. Home improvement specialist Eric Shipe says silicone caulk weakens and melts off surfaces when you heat it up gradually. So, heat may help remove caulk on your skin, too. Turn your hair dryer on low and hold it high above the affected areas so you can feel the warmth but don’t get burned. Simply wave it over the caulk until you feel it start to loosen and melt. [10] X Research source Use a sponge or another mild abrasive to scrub off the melted caulk under running water. Stop heating the caulk if the heat becomes intense or painful on your skin. Silicone isn't worth burning yourself over—it will eventually fall off on its own."

      "content": "Rub your hands with Goo Gone or WD-40 . Goo Gone is a popular adhesive and sticky-substance remover. They make a product that’s safe to use on your skin, which may help remove stubborn silicone caulk. Shipe also says WD-40 can “break down the silicone” on surfaces, “making it easier to scrape off.” So, spray a bit on a cotton ball or paper towel and dab the caulk on your hands. Wash your hands thoroughly after applying WD-40. While WD-40 isn’t considered toxic or harmful, it can potentially irritate your skin when left on it for a long time. [11] X Research source"

      "content": "Dab the caulk with mineral spirits . Shipe says mineral spirits (which is a paint thinner and turpentine substitute) can soften and weaken stubborn silicone caulk on surfaces, so it may work on your hands. Just apply some on a cotton ball or paper towel. Then, lightly dab and wipe at the caulk until it comes off. Warning : Thoroughly wash your hands when you’re done. While mineral spirits are usually not dangerous to touch, being in direct contact with mineral spirits for several hours or longer can lead to serious chemical burns. [12] X Research source Warning : Do not throw away soaked cotton balls or paper towels in your regular trash, as mineral spirits can spontaneously combust. Instead, allow them to dry. Then, place them in an oily waste container and take them to a hazardous waste disposal facility .

      "content": "If all else fails, simply wait for the silicone caulk to fall off. Particularly stubborn spots of silicone caulk might stick to your hands despite your best efforts to get it off. In this case, your best bet may be to simply wait for it to fall off on its own. Your body naturally sheds dead skin cells and once the skin under the dried caulk falls off, it will take the caulk with it. The human body takes about 27 days to completely shed and replenish an entire layer of skin. [14] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source However, it’ll probably take about 1 week for the silicon caulk to fall off your hands."

      "content": "Wear gloves and long-sleeved clothing when applying caulk. The best way to avoid getting silicone caulk on your hands is to wear nitrile gloves . Then, put on a long-sleeved shirt and pair of pants that you don’t mind getting dirty to prevent the caulk from getting on your arms and legs, too. [17] X Research source Remove caulk on your clothes by rubbing the spot with a damp cloth. If that doesn’t work, freeze the caulk and scrape it off with a spoon or butter knife. Or, dab the stain with acetone."

      "title": "Wet your hands before touching the caulk.",
      "content": "Wet your hands before touching the caulk. If you don’t have gloves, wetting your hands with water is a simple way to prevent the caulk from sticking to your skin. Just keep a wet sponge or rag with you to ensure your hands stay moist as you apply the caulk. [18] X Research source Professional handyman Barry Zakar suggests using “the wet finger technique” to smooth the caulk after you apply it. He says you just “wet your finger and run it along the bead” to “get a nice, smooth even result.” Alternatively, use a putty knife or caulk finishing tool to smooth the caulk. This way, you don’t have to worry about your hands getting dirty."

      "title": "Apply a thin layer of caulk and work slowly.",
      "content": "Apply a thin layer of caulk and work slowly. When applying caulk , Zakar advises only cutting the tip of the nozzle so you produce a small bead; cutting the tip too large can create “too much excess” and “it makes a mess.” Then, he suggests you “take your time” and “maintain an equal, even pressure on the gun as you move along and place the caulk.” Professional handyman Kevin Turner agrees and says, “When you apply [caulk]...you want to try to use it as thin as possible. The more you use, obviously, the harder it is to keep clean.”"

      "content": "Use masking tape to create neat and straight lines. Instead of using your finger to smooth the caulk, home renovation and repair specialist Art Fricke says to “use masking tape.” He suggests placing the tape in a straight line next to the area you’re caulking. Apply the caulk and then “mash in the silicone” to “get it nice and smooth.” He just says to “pick up the tape before the silicone gets tacky” to reveal the “perfect caulk line that goes exactly where you want it to go.”"
