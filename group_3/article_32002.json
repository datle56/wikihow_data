Even if you do mess up, you are human, as is everyone watching you. Even professionals mess up."

      "content": "Stop unrealistic predictions. One unhelpful thing people do when dealing with social fears is make false, unrealistic predictions about the social situation. You can't predict what will happen. If you try, you will only come up with the worst case scenario, which will not be close to a realistic reflection of the actual event. This only causes unnecessary anxiety. [3] X Trustworthy Source HelpGuide Nonprofit organization dedicated to providing free, evidence-based mental health and wellness resources.

If so, take a step back, and realize that most people aren't focused on you. If they are focused on you, they are not thinking the same negative thoughts as you are. Don't try to read people's minds. You can't know what people are thinking. Plus, they do not see the same negative self that you see in your mind. Use social situations to practice changing negative thoughts about yourself, and practice stopping and altering your thoughts about judgement from others.

      "content": "Change your focus. One of the ways to help reduce your anxiety is to take the focus off of yourself in social situations. Try to pay attention to your surroundings, the conversation, and connecting with the people around you. Begin to understand that although you are focused with how others will think of you, everyone else is not as focused on you. If you say or do something embarrassing, others may not even notice. Or if they do, they will quickly forget it. Try to focus on other things when you notice your physical symptoms in social situations. You are not being as obvious as you think. It is very rare that others can notice physical symptoms of anxiety or even panic attacks. Instead notice your experience of the event, such as music you hear, how each bite of food tastes, or other entertainment such as art or dancing. Most people are just as nervous in social situations as you are. They are too busy focused on themselves."

Starting at the bottom, try to gradually face each anxiety-inducing situation. Wait until you feel moderately comfortable with the previous situation before moving to the more stressful one. You want to overcome your anxiety, not increase it. This list may take awhile to get through, and that's okay. You may never reach number 10. But if you have conquered 1-7, you have made your social phobia significantly more manageable. If you feel you are struggling through this, contact a mental health professional who can offer you support while you attempt to face each fear on your list."

      "content": "Make observable goals for yourself. Getting over your social anxiety may seem like a nebulous process. How do you know if you are getting better? Just putting yourself in social situations isn't enough. That might be step 1, but after that, you need to work on interacting more. Make goals for yourself for each social outing. As you accomplish your goals, you can start to see progress and improvement in yourself. Make small talk with people you see often, such as employees, schoolmates, or other people that you come in contact with. This may be just a comment on the weather, your homework or work project, or the meeting you had earlier. Start by giving yourself a goal of speaking to one person once a week. Then increase it to every day, or speaking to multiple people in one day. Make a goal to make one comment in class or in your meeting. Don't worry about what everyone else thinks. Focus on the fact that you did it. That is progress. If you are in a group setting, make a pact with yourself to say at least 3 comments in the conversation. Ask someone to dinner. It can be as a friend or as a date. Don't focus on the response - only focus on the fact that you were assertive and asked. This helps you focus on the task and the goal, not the nerves. The idea here is to get control of the situation. You know you can control what you do, what you say, and what you ask. You can't control the other person, so don't worry about them. You can even try practicing with a friend at home what youâ€™ll do or say in social situations."

Worrying and stressing about the event causes you to have anxiety when you finally get to the situation. Try thinking about the event while you are relaxed. Take a warm bath, curl up in a cozy blanket, or listen to your favorite song. Think about the upcoming event. Since you are in a good, relaxed head space, this can help you feel better about the upcoming event. Imagine that you are in the situation. Imagine yourself relaxed and confident. Thinking about the situation in a positive, relaxed way can help you overcome negative thoughts. [8] X Research source"

Registered Clinical Counsellor & Men's Mental Health Expert Expert Interview. 10 February 2021. Do breathing exercises everyday so it becomes second nature and comes naturally when you're in a stressful situation. Breathe through your abdomen, not your chest. To do this, lay on the floor or sit straight in a chair. Place a hand on your chest, the other on your abdomen. As you inhale, the hand on your abdomen should move while the one on your chest stays mostly at the same place. Inhale slowly and deeply through your nose. Hold for a count of 7. Exhale slowly through your mouth for a count of 8. Gently contract your abdominal muscles to get all the air from the lungs. This is extremely important. Complete 5 deep breaths. Try 1 deep breath per 10 seconds."

A good friend or family member will help to motivate you and help you overcome your fear. Ask these people to help support you as you gain the courage to try something new. Ask your family or friends to go places with you that cause anxiety. Sometimes going to new places with someone you trust can help reduce your anxiety. Make sure you lean on supportive, positive, and encouraging friends and family members. If they are negative, put you down, lecture you, or criticize you, find someone else to support you.

The more you get used to something, the less fear and control it has over you. [11] X Research source Try making spaces yours. Anything is nerve-wracking when it's unfamiliar. Go to a restaurant, a part of town, or your gym. Walk around. Become familiar with it. Once you start to become familiar with a place, it can feel more comfortable. Plus, you start to put your focus on your surroundings. Then you can start socializing with people. Take someone with you. You don't have to do this alone. Take a friend or family member to an event. Start small. Take a free class at a community center, go to a group class at the gym, volunteer, or join a meet up group and attend a gathering."

This helps you connect with the other people, which is a good thing, and offers you opportunities to talk. When you start to worry about how you look to everyone else, pause and refocus on the present moment. Add comments and talk when it seems natural. Focus on the present, instead of replaying things that have already happened."

At first, the anxiety may feel unbearable, but anxiety gradually lessens the longer you are in a situation. Try to stay in the situation until your anxiety reduces by half. This may take up to half an hour, but oftentimes it lessens quickly. Some social situations are quick, like saying hello or making small talk. Although that may cause anxiety that you can't wait through, you can feel good about speaking to the person and making small talk."

There are a bunch of people contributing into the conversation, so don't feel like you're pressured to say something. Try to be comfortable. Look around at the other people in the room. Are they all focused on you? Or are they enjoying everyone's company? When you get a chance to contribute something meaningful that you think the others will appreciate, throw it in there. You'll do just fine. This is a great place to make goals for yourself. Start by saying you'll say one thing in the conversation, and increase as you get more comfortable."

Most people make an effort to pay attention to the good things people do and say. Feel confident in this knowledge and express your good qualities. Be yourself. Most people will enjoy your company. Those who pick at your flaws usually do so because of a lack of self-esteem on their part. If they are judging you, you don't want to be around them in the first place."
