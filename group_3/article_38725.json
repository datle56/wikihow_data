      "content": "Visit your guidance counselor’s office. Your guidance counselor is a valuable resource when you’re applying to college. Your counselor can help make sure you understand application requirements, help you narrow down your preferred schools, and may even write letters of recommendation to colleges on your behalf. Even if you haven’t been to the guidance office for application help already, stop by and request your transcript. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Fill out an official transcript request form and pay any required fees. Some colleges will give you a form which you must take to your guidance counselor, but if you didn’t get one in your application packet, your high school counselor will likely have their own form for you to fill out. You may be expected to pay a small fee when you request your transcripts, so check with your counselor first. [2] X Research source Some schools charge a one-time fee at the start of freshman year, while others require a small fee each time transcripts are requested."

      "content": "Ask your counselor to send your official transcript for you. Your guidance counselor is usually the one who is responsible for sending your transcript to the schools you’ve applied to. If you decide you want to deliver your transcripts yourself, request an official sealed copy. Make sure the envelope containing your transcripts stays sealed until you deliver it to the college registrar. [3] X Research source Some schools will not accept transcripts that are delivered by students, even if they are sealed. Be sure to check with your school before choosing this option. Some colleges accept transcripts which are sent electronically, but you'll need to ask your counselor if your high school has this option. Some high schools don't make their transcripts available to online services until after the student has graduated."

Records for students who have already graduated are often kept at the headquarters of the local school district or the Board of Education for your county. Contact them first to ask about getting copies of your transcript sent to a college. [4] X Research source"

If your local school district no longer has your school records, they may be stored at the state's Department of Education building. Each state has its own regulations on how long education records must be stored, but most states keep records for at least 50 years. The state of Oregon keeps an original copy of student records for at least 75 years. [5] X Trustworthy Source State of Oregon Official website for the State of Oregon Go to source"
