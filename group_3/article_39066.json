[1] X Trustworthy Source U.S. Small Business Administration U.S. government agency focused on supporting small businesses Go to source For example, setting up your café near a college is a good idea because college students frequently go to internet cafés and coffee shops to study.

Search databases such as the Better Business Bureau (BBB) for your name ideas so you don't choose one that's already taken. Business advisor Madison Boehm says choosing a name is one of the 3 most important things every business owner should prioritize. The other two things are financing (especially understanding how tax laws work in your state) and establishing a business structure (i.e., an LLC or a sole proprietorship). At the same time, don't spend too long choosing a name! According to marketing expert Travis Peters, \"Brand is much more important than name. Focus on the brand and/or culture you want to build and the name will follow.\""

      "title": "Set up your internet café's business structure.",
      "content": "Set up your internet café's business structure. To start a business in the United States, you must choose a structure that will dictate how taxes are paid and whether or not the owners are liable for any debts or costs they accrue. The most popular options for small cafés are the sole proprietorship or the Limited Liability Company (LLC) . [2] X Research source Sole proprietorships are easier and quicker to set up and manage for taxes, but they don't offer any liability protection to the owner. In other words, the owner's personal assets are considered the same as their business assets in the eyes of the law, which means they can be seized if the owner fails to pay their business debts. LLCs take longer to register and the taxes are a bit more complex, but the upside is they protect the owners' personal assets from liability. To start a sole proprietorship, you may not need to file any paperwork. Check with your local county clerk's office to make sure. An LLC, on the other hand, requires several legal documents, including Articles of Confederation, an Operating Agreement, and an Employee Identification Number (EIN) for taxes. Contact the county clerk when you're ready to get started."

A Doing Business As (DBA) is an assumed name that's sometimes (but not always) required whenever you're transacting using your business name instead of your own. Even if your local government doesn't require it, it's a good idea to get one. For example, let's say you need to buy disposable coffee cups and lids for your Internet café. If you use a credit or debit card under your DBA name (i.e., the Internet café name), you're effectively keeping your business and personal finances separate. That makes them easier to keep track of for sales and tax purposes.

Marketing plan : The marketing plan should describe how you plan on addressing the needs of your market, how you will communicate with customers, and how you will advertise your café. Funding request : The funding request outlines how much funding (i.e., money) you need to finance your business for the next 5 years. It should include staff salaries and estimated equipment costs. You should also specify what type of funding you're looking for, whether that's investment capital or a business loan.
