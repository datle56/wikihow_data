      "content": "Choose a heavyweight fabric, such as canvas or laminated cotton. Aprons are usually made from a durable, washable fabric. Opt for natural material, such as cotton, but make sure to choose a fabric that is heavy enough to protect your clothing from any food or grease that may splatter onto it. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Buy, download, or create a pattern for the apron body. Purchase an apron pattern in a craft supply store. If you don't want to buy a pattern, find a free apron pattern online to download and print. To create a pattern, fold an apron in half lengthwise and place it on top of a large piece of paper. Then, trace around the outside of the apron to create a pattern for the body of the apron. Add an additional 0.5 in (1.3 cm) around the non-fold adjacent edges of the apron body for seam allowance.

      "content": "Measure the straps and draw them on the pattern paper. Measure the length and width of the strap that goes around the neck. Do the same for the ties at the waist of the apron. Then, draw a rectangle that is twice the width and half the length of each of the straps plus 1 in (2.5 cm) to both measurements for seam allowance. Make a separate pattern for the neck strap and the waist straps. [3] X Research source For example, if the waist straps on the apron that you are using as your example are 20 by 2 in (50.8 by 5.1 cm), then your rectangle would need to be 10 by 4 in (25 by 10 cm) plus 1 in (2.5 cm) seam allowance, so 11 by 5 in (28 by 13 cm). Only make 1 waist strap pattern and cut it out 2 times to get 2 waist tie pieces."

      "content": "Fold your fabric in half and pin the pattern pieces on the fabric. Fold the fabric in half lengthwise and smooth it out to make sure that there are no lumps or bumps. Place the body pattern piece so that the long straight edge is against the fold. Place the strap pieces so that 1 of the short ends is on the fold. Insert pins through the pattern piece and fabric. Place 1 pin every 2 to 3 in (5.1 to 7.6 cm) going all the way around the edges. [4] X Research source Pinning your pattern on the fold saves you the trouble of cutting out 2 pieces for each part of the apron and sewing them together again."

Cut out 1 body piece, 2 waist straps, and 1 neck strap. Cut out 2 waist strap pieces using the waist pattern piece you made. [5] X Research source Make sure to use a pair of sharp fabric scissors to cut out your pieces and be careful not to create any jagged edges as you cut."
