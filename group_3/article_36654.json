      "content": "Hold the condom's rim. When you have finished sex, hold your penis parallel to the floor or pointing downwards with one hand. Use the other hand to grab the condom's ring, or outer end. Make sure you grasp the condom's base firmly. By holding onto the bottom, the condom is less likely to come off. Remove the condom carefully by rolling it down. Do not pull on the tip of the condom. Roll the ring down and then slide it off when you have rolled it down enough to easily slide it off your penis. Inspect the used condom for holes. If your condom has broken, your partner will need to use a back-up form of birth control. Pills like Plan B can help in this situation. Additionally, you or your partner might need to seek STI testing. [3] X Research source Do not fill the condom up with water to test it for holes! This used to be recommended, but it is not recommended anymore."
