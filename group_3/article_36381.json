      "content": "Remove mildew or mold by vacuuming out any moisture. Use a wet-dry vac to vacuum out any moisture from your car's upholstery or carpets. Once you're done, leave the windows open for 8-10 hours to allow the car's interior to fully dry out. If you cleaned removable rugs or mats, let them dry in the sun to kill mold and mildew. Once the interior is dry, the mildew smell should be gone. Prevent future mildew in your vehicle by checking for any leaks in your car. You can check for leaks by parking your car over a sheet of clean cardboard overnight. If you find that your car has leaks, take it to a mechanic for repair. If leaks aren't an issue, the mildew or mold may have occurred because of a spilled drink or wet gear being placed in the car and left there. Remove any contaminants such as rotting food and clean the area of the car with an all-purpose cleaner or shampoo."
