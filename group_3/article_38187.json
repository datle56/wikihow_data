      "title": "To say \"hello\" in Polish, say \"cześć.\"",
      "content": "To say \"hello\" in Polish, say \"cześć.\" This very common, albeit somewhat informal greeting, is pronounced roughly like \"cheh-sh-ch.\" Non-Poles may find it difficult to pronounce this word correctly. Following a \"sh\" sound with a \"ch\" sound is something that is almost never done in English. [2] X Research source \"Cześć\" is a little informal to use in serious social situations. While it's fine for friends and family members, some etiquette-conscious Poles may be offended if you use it the very first time you meet them. \"Cześć\" may also be used to say \"bye.\""

    {
      "title": "To say \"good day,\" say \"dzień dobry.\"",
      "content": "To say \"good day,\" say \"dzień dobry.\" This greeting, which literally translates to \"good day,\" is pronounced as \"jayn DOH-bry.\" The first syllable in this phrase sounds almost like \"Jane.\" The final \"y\" sounds like the \"i\" in \"fin,\" \"dinner,\" and \"sick.\" [3] X Research source This is a more formal way to say \"hello,\" and is suitable for situations where you're dealing with people that you don't know, or that you know in a professional context (e.g., customers, bosses, teachers, etc.) \"Dzień dobry\" can also mean \"good morning.\""
    },
    {
      "title": "To say \"good evening,\" say \"dobry wieczór.\"",
      "content": "To say \"good evening,\" say \"dobry wieczór.\" This is pronounced as \"DOH-bry VYEH-choorh.\" \"Dobry\" is pronounced the same way as in \"dzień dobry.\" The W at the beginning of \"wieczór\" is pronounced like a V, not an English W. [4] X Research source As in English, this greeting is used when meeting people after the sun has begun to go down but before it has gotten completely dark. \"Dobry wieczór\" has the same level of formality as \"dzień dobry.\""
    },
    {
      "title": "To say \"hey,\" say \"hej.\"",
      "content": "To say \"hey,\" say \"hej.\" This is pronounced exactly like the English \"hey.\" It is a very familiar and informal greeting. You won't want to use it for formal situations or people that you're interested in maintaining a professional relationship with. It is best used among close friends. \"Hey\" in Polish works the same as saying \"hey\" in English."

    {
      "title": "Say \"witam\" when you are greeting guests and you are the host.",
      "content": "Say \"witam\" when you are greeting guests and you are the host. This word is pronounced as “vee-tahm.” The W in the first syllable is pronounced like the English V. The second syllable has a soft \"ah\" sound, as in \"apartment.\" [5] X Research source \"Witam\" is not always an appropriate greeting, especially to strangers. It can subtly imply that you occupy a higher social station than the person you're talking to. It is best reserved for when you are greeting guests to your home."

    {
      "title": "When in doubt, opt for semi-formal/formal greetings.",
      "content": "When in doubt, opt for semi-formal/formal greetings. Unlike what is common in many English-speaking countries today, for Polish people, it's not typical to greet someone you've never met before as if you are already friends. Greetings are more reserved and formal than what many English-speakers are a little used to. Thus, it's often best to use the more formal greetings at your disposal, such as \"dzień dobry,\" rather than risking an informal \"hej\" or \"cześć.\" [6] X Research source Of course, once you've gotten to know someone, you can usually progress to the informal greetings for casual conversations. However, unless you're a confident Polish speaker, you may want to play things safe and follow the lead of the person you're talking to."

      "title": "Use \"Pan\" or \"Pani\" when addressing a man or woman by last name.",
      "content": "Use \"Pan\" or \"Pani\" when addressing a man or woman by last name. Respect is an important concept when it comes to greetings in Polish society—especially those occurring in a business/formal setting. Because of this, you will want to address the people you meet by their proper titles until you are invited to address them on a first-name basis. If you don't know the honorific for the person you are talking to, use \"Pan\" for men and \"Pani\" for women. [7] X Research source \"Pan\" has a soft \"ah\" sound to it, as in \"apartment.\" \"Pani\" starts out just like \"Pan,\" but has a long \"e\" sound at the end, as in \"bee\" or \"see.\" Polish last names ending in \"ski\" change depending on gender. Polanski would be used for a man, while Polanska would be used for a female. Don't be offended if you don't get invited to address someone by his or her first name. Getting invited into this \"inner circle\" is a big social step to Poles. Many business and professional relationships go on for years before \"making the jump.\""

      "title": "Greet everyone at social events, but greet women first.",
      "content": "Greet everyone at social events, but greet women first. When attending a social event, such as a party or a business meeting, it's important etiquette to greet everyone that you encounter in the room. Passing someone over, or not acknowledging him or her, can be seen as rude and disrespectful. Traditionally, women are greeted first in Polish society. Usually, your host will handle the introductions, so you probably won't have to worry about this."

      "title": "Shake hands upon greetings, and maintain eye contact.",
      "content": "Shake hands upon greetings, and maintain eye contact. You will also want to shake hands (again, with eye contact) upon leaving as well. [8] X Research source If you are male, and the woman you are greeting extends her hand to you (palm down), you may take it, bow down, and give it a delicate kiss; never lift the woman's hand to your lips. This is a little old-fashioned, but still considered good etiquette."

      "title": "Know that close friends and family members often greet each other with a kiss on the cheek.",
      "content": "Know that close friends and family members often greet each other with a kiss on the cheek. While adult males and teenagers who aren't well acquainted typically greet with a handshake, people who know each other well will often greet one another with a friendly kiss on the cheek. This isn't a sign of romantic affection at all. It can be done innocently by almost any combination of two people as long as they're close (e.g., people of different sexes, people of the same sex, siblings, parents and their children, and so on.) In Poland , it is customary to use two to three kisses: first on the right cheek, then on the left, then on the right again. Hugs are almost common among Polish people. Don't be alarmed if an overly friendly host gives you one as though you were an old friend."

      "title": "Get into the spirit of giving and receiving.",
      "content": "Get into the spirit of giving and receiving. When visiting someone's home, it is not uncommon for the guest to bring a small gift, such as cut flowers, sweets, or alcohol. Flowers are the most common and expected, however. If you are bringing flowers, try to pick out an odd number instead of an even one. Do not bring chrysanthemums, which are often used for funerals. Skip on the very expensive gifts, as this might embarrass the host. Do not be offended if you are a host and do not receive a gift. On the other hand, if you do receive a gift, be sure to thank your guest, and to open the gift."

      "title": "Don't be \"prymitywny\"!",
      "content": "Don't be \"prymitywny\"! In Polish, a rude person who ignores social etiquette is called \"prymitywny\" (literally, \"primitive.\") Luckily, avoiding this label is simple: just give an honest effort to greet the people you meet with respect and treat them with the courtesy and kindness you'd want for yourself. Unless you're an excellent Polish speaker, you'll probably make a few minor breaches of etiquette in during your time in a Polish-speaking community. As long as you do your best to be polite and acknowledge your mistakes, you'll be fine. Anyone who gives you grief for minor slip-ups in a language you're not familiar with is prymitywny."

      "title": "To say \"goodnight,\" say \"dobranoc.\"",
      "content": "To say \"goodnight,\" say \"dobranoc.\" This is pronounced as \"doh-BRAH-nohts.\" The \"oh\" sounds are soft, as in \"ocean.\" The a is a soft \"ah\" sound, as in \"apartment.\" [9] X Research source This word is used similarly to the way you'd use \"good night\" in English—you can say it to someone as you depart at night, right before you go to bed, and so on."
    },
    {
      "title": "To say \"how are you?\"",
      "content": "To say \"how are you?\" say \"jak się masz?\" In many languages, it's customary to ask how someone is after saying \"hello.\" Polish is no different. This phrase is pronounced as “yahk sheh mash.” Both of the \"a\" sounds are soft \"ahs,\" as in \"apartment. [10] X Research source This is also informal, and is best used after \"cześć\" or \"hej.\" It's not suitable after more formal greetings, such as \"Dzień dobry\" or \"dobry wieczór.\""
    },
    {
      "title": "To say \"goodbye,\" say \"do widzenia.\"",
      "content": "To say \"goodbye,\" say \"do widzenia.\" When it's time to leave, use this phrase, which is pronounced \"doh veed-ZEN-yah.\" The only item of note here is that the W here receives the customary V pronunciation. The rest of the word is fairly easy to sound out. It's pronounced almost how it would be if it were an English. [11] X Research source"

      "title": "Say \"thank you\" when asked how you're doing.",
      "content": "Say \"thank you\" when asked how you're doing. If you want to really impress your Polish hosts, offer this up when someone asks you how you are doing after the initial greetings. The implication here is that, by asking about you, someone has shown an interest in your affairs. By saying \"thank you,\" you are graciously acknowledging their interest and paying them a social courtesy in return. [12] X Research source \"Dziękuję\" is pronounced like \"jen-KOO-yeh.\" \"Proszę\" (prosh-eh) means \"please.\" It can also mean \"you're welcome\" if it follows \"dziękuję.\" \"Dobrze\" (doh-b-jeh) means \"good.\" \"Bardzo dobrze\" (bard-zoh doh-b-jeh) means \"very good.\""
