      "title": "The speaker is fascinated by her lover’s beauty.",
      "content": "The speaker is fascinated by her lover’s beauty. Perez has stated that she wrote “ Sailor Song ” about a girl who looked like Anne Hathaway, but there’s also a deeper meaning behind the song’s opening lines, “I saw her in the rightest way/Looking like Anne Hathaway.” [1] X Research source These lyrics suggest that the speaker is captivated by her lover and that her lover has an elegant, star-like quality about her. The speaker loves her not just for her appearance but for her magnetic personality. Some other lines in the first verse are “And then, she came up to my knees/Begging, baby, would you please/Do the things you said you’d do to me.” This suggests the feeling is mutual and that both people in the relationship want to find connection and be close to each other."

      "title": "The song is about loving someone passionately.",
      "content": "The song is about loving someone passionately. In the song’s chorus, Perez sings, “Oh, won’t you kiss me on the mouth and love me like a sailor?” Sailors sail through storms and dangerous waters, dedicating their lives to the sea. By saying she wants to be loved like a sailor, the speaker is saying she wants an all-encompassing love. She wants her lover to stick by her side through all the highs and lows of a relationship and to be proud of loving her. [2] X Research source Sailors also travel and spend a lot of time away from their loved ones. Another interpretation of this line suggests that the relationship could be long-distance and that Perez wants their love to remain strong despite the distance."

      "title": "The speaker’s admiration for her lover is akin to worship.",
      "content": "The speaker’s admiration for her lover is akin to worship. In the chorus, Perez also sings, “I don’t believe in God, but I believe that you’re my savior.” This use of religious imagery shows that the speaker is highly devoted to her lover and puts her on a pedestal. Instead of finding comfort in faith, her partner brings her a sense of peace and purpose. It’s almost as if their relationship is the only faith she needs. [3] X Research source Because the song is about two women, some people also interpret this line as a critique of the church’s stance on gay relationships. Because the church does not accept their love, the speaker instead finds solace in her lover. The following lines say, “My mom says that she’s worried, but I’m covered in this favor.” This suggests that outsiders don’t understand the intensity of the relationship, but the speaker feels protected by the relationship."
    },
    {
      "title": "“Sailor Song” is also about longing.",
      "content": "“Sailor Song” is also about longing. Perez finishes the chorus by singing, “I sleep so I can see you and I hate to wait so long.” In this line, the speaker looks forward to sleeping because it means she can see her lover in her dreams. This suggests that the couple may not always be able to be together physically. The speaker yearns for her lover, almost like it’s painful to be away from her. Perez repeats this line, stressing its importance."

    {
      "title": "The speaker compares this relationship to her past.",
      "content": "The speaker compares this relationship to her past. Perez sings, “She took my fingers to her mouth/The kind of thing that makes you proud/That nothing else had ever/Worked out.” This small, intimate moment is so special for the speaker that she feels like all of her past mistakes and failed relationships led up to this moment. It’s like a reward for everything she’s been through. The relationship isn’t perfect, however. In the following lines, Perez sings, “But nothing can capture the sting/Of the venom she’s gonna spit out right now.” This shows that even in a deeply intimate relationship, there is still conflict. The word “venom” suggests the intensity of their relationship can also sometimes be hurtful."

    {
      "title": "The song is about finding a safe space in love.",
      "content": "The song is about finding a safe space in love. In the final lines of the song, Perez sings, “And we can run away to the walls inside your house/I can be the cat, baby, you can be the mouse/And we can laugh off things that we know nothing about/We can go forever until you wanna sit it out.” This suggests the speaker has a desire to escape from everything and focus all her attention on being with her lover. They want a safe space where they can leave their worries behind. [4] X Research source The “cat and mouse” line also suggests that there is a playful aspect to the relationship despite its intensity."
