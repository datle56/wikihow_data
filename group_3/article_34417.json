      "content": "Cut a 4 inch (10 cm) section off a stem just below the root node. The root nodes are the small brown nodes on the golden pothos’ stems. Try to find a 4 inch (10 cm) section of stem that is healthy and has at least 3 leaves on it. [1] X Research source Use pruning shears or a sharp knife to cut the stem. Avoid propagating with stems that are wilted or brown."

      "content": "Dip the stem in a rooting hormone if you want it to root faster. Rooting hormones are gels or powders that help plants grow roots faster. You can still propagate your golden pothos stem without a rooting hormone, but it may take longer to root. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Put the stem in water if you want the roots to grow before you pot it. Golden pothos can be rooted in both water and soil. If you decide to root the stem in water, fill a jar with enough water to cover the base of the stem. Put the stem in the jar and place it somewhere that gets indirect sunlight. Wait about a month for the roots to form. Then, transfer the rooted stem to soil."

      "content": "Fill a small pot with 1 part peat moss and 1 part coarse sand. You can also use perlite instead of sand. The sand or perlite will give the soil good drainage, which will help prevent your new golden pothos from getting root rot. [4] X Research source Use a pot that has drainage holes in the bottom."
