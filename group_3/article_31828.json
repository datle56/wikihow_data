      "content": "Go online to find a list of food providers in the area. Type “restaurants near me” into any search engine to compare the various dining options you have available to you. If your smartphone or device has a voice-activated digital assistant, you could also try simply asking it something like, “Where’s a good place to eat around here?” [1] X Research source Reading through the user reviews on sites like Yelp, TripAdvisor, and Zomato could help you narrow down your choices if it comes down to a toss-up between multiple restaurants. Some hotels (typically those that aren’t equipped with full kitchens) also provide takeout menus for local restaurants. These can ordinarily be found somewhere in the lobby or lounge area."

      "title": "Decide what you want to eat.",
      "content": "Decide what you want to eat. One of the biggest advantages of getting food delivered to your hotel is that you can get just about anything you’re in the mood for, rather than being restricted to what’s on the room service menu. It could be a fully-loaded sub from a neighborhood deli, some spicy curry, or a trusty pizza made just the way you like it. Listen to your stomach! [2] X Research source Peruse the menus of multiple restaurants that specialize in the same style of cuisine if your first choice doesn’t offer the dish you’re after."

      "title": "Confirm the address of the hotel where you’re staying.",
      "content": "Confirm the address of the hotel where you’re staying. Run a quick search for the name of the hotel plus the street it sits on and the city you happen to be in. The hotel may also print their street address on their check-in literature, stationery, or other in-house materials. And if all else fails, simply ask for the information you need at the front desk. [3] X Research source If you’re the tech-savvy sort, another option is to zero in on your current location using the maps app on your phone or device. [4] X Research source Make sure you’re providing the right address, especially if you’re lodging at a popular hotel chain. It’s not uncommon for these businesses to operate multiple locations within a single town or city."

      "title": "Build your order through the restaurant's website or app.",
      "content": "Build your order through the restaurant's website or app. To get started, just select the tab that says something like “Place Your Order” or “Order Online.” The online ordering systems for most restaurants are fairly intuitive—they’ll walk you through the process from start to finish. The simple click-to-add-item interface will be basically identical if you're going through a third-party delivery service like GrubHub or DoorDash. [5] X Research source Alternatively, you can do things the old fashioned way and call in your order over the phone. You’ll usually find an establishment’s phone number listed in the short profile displayed at the top of your search engine results. If you decide to dial up the eatery, make sure you use the correct area code and any necessary extension numbers for outgoing calls. In most cases, these will be labelled on or near the phone in your room."

      "content": "Add a drink to your order to avoid paying for overpriced hotel beverages. There’s no sense in dropping $5 on a canned soda from the minibar in your room when you can get a fresh one delivered with the rest of your food for a fraction of the price. Just mention that you’d like to tack on one or more drinks while you’re putting in your order. [6] X Research source A lot of the time, this is the only way to enjoy specialty beverages from various restaurants without actually dining on-site."

Then, use the provided spaces to put in a name for your order, the address of the hotel where you’re staying, and your credit or debit card information. Some apps and websites might also allow you to pay using other mobile methods, such as ApplePay or PayPal. While paying for your order through a third-party delivery service, you’ll have the option to add a tip to your total. Either choose one of the specified dollar amounts ($1, $2, $3, $5, etc.) to keep things quick and easy, or tap the “Edit” button to enter a custom amount. [7] X Research source Your final total will include the price of your food plus tax, plus a delivery fee and a small service charge, if you went through an app."

There, you’ll find the unique tracking number assigned to your order, along with a short message displaying its current status and an ETA (estimated time of arrival). Your order status will update periodically, so be sure to check back if you’re curious as to the whereabouts of your food. [8] X Research source You can also keep tabs on your order by clicking the “Track My Order” link in the confirmation email you get as soon as it’s been received. Some services even provide their customers with digital maps allowing them to follow their delivery person’s movements in real-time. [9] X Research source"

Don’t forget to hand off a cash tip to your delivery person before they depart, assuming you didn’t charge the extra amount to your card when you paid for your order. 10-15% of the total cost is customary in most parts of the world. If you’re feeling generous, consider leaving 20% or more. It will certainly be appreciated! [11] X Research source As a general rule, it's alright to tip a little less if there was a delivery charge included in your order total. Keep in mind that most food delivery people work primarily on the basis of gratuity, which means if you don’t tip, they don’t get paid (much).

      "content": "Be prepared to sneak your food in if the hotel doesn’t allow outside orders. Not all hotels are equally open to their guests having meals delivered from other businesses. If you’re lodging somewhere that has a strict no-outside-food policy and you just can’t live without your sesame chicken fix, it might be wise to intercept your delivery person in the parking lot or go pick up your order yourself to keep the transaction on the down-low. Crack a window before you dig in if your hotel prohibits guests from eating inside their rooms. That way, there will be less chance of the appetizing aroma giving you away. While very few hotels have rules expressly forbidding outside food, there are some that do. Take the time to read the fine print in your booking agreement so you won’t be at risk of being kicked out for violating the terms of your stay."

Room service menus often take the form of slick, multi-page brochures at large chain hotels; in more modest hotels and inns, they may be limited to a single printed page. You’ll find a wide range of foods to choose from in the average room service menu, from light breakfasts and simple lunches to full meals and even single items like smoothies, specialty coffee drinks, and bottles of wine. Don’t be shocked when you see the prices listed next to each item—hotel room service is infamous for being exorbitantly expensive. Try to look at it as the cost of convenience.

Tell them what you’d like and what room you’re staying in. They should give you an estimated time for delivery before hanging up. [14] X Research source Feel free to modify, customize, or enhance your order however you desire. Most hotel kitchens are happy to accommodate special requests. These days, many nicer hotel rooms come equipped with tablets that make it possible to put in an order for room service with a few swift taps. This type of technology could come as a relief if you don’t feel like having to talk to anyone. [15] X Research source"

Room service etiquette differs from one hotel to another. In some cases, your waiter may knock and then excuse themselves quietly. In others, they may wait for you to answer the door to confirm that you’re in your room. [17] X Research source Make sure you’re decent when you answer the door. [18] X Research source You’re welcome to tip your waiter if you’re in a giving mood, but be aware that a sizable gratuity is frequently factored into the price of room service food. [19] X Research source Hang up your “Do Not Disturb” sign if you don’t wish to be bothered. This will signal to your waiter to drop off your order, which you can then come out and collect at your own leisure."

[20] X Research source If you want to go the extra mile, call room service back when you’re done eating to let them know that your tray is ready for collection. Don’t pile your room service tray with product packages, paper, used coffee filters, or other non-food-related trash you’ve generated in your room. That’s what the waste basket is for."

This is a standard practice in many hotels, and one that makes things easier for the majority of guests. [21] X Research source Some hotels may also offer their guests the option to pay with cash upon delivery. In-room payment might work better for you if you only plan on making use of room service once or twice or want to avoid putting too many unnecessary expenses on your credit card."
