      "content": "Work out your budget for the cocktail party. It is not essential that you provide a full bar. As long as you have a variety of spirits, wine, beer and non-alcoholic drinks, the guests will most likely be content."

      "title": "Choose the location for your bar.",
      "content": "Choose the location for your bar. You want to make sure there is a flow of people past the cocktail bar and into standing or seating areas. Place the bar away from the appetizers or other food and away from the entryway, to avoid a bottleneck. If possible, place your bar in the kitchen, because it is easier to clean spills off counters and tile than off carpet."

      "content": "Protect the bar area by laying down place mats on the counter or table and rugs on any carpeted or hard-to-clean floor. If the bar will be away from the kitchen, make sure you have a nearby source of water and kitchen towels for spills. Lay a tablecloth over the table. If you are putting up a collapsible table for your bar, make sure it is about 30 inches (76 cm) wide and 6 feet (182 cm) long, to avoid a long wait for drinks."

      "content": "Decide if you prefer a self-serve bar or a bartender. Hire a bartender a month to a few weeks in advance, as the good freelance bartenders book up early."

      "content": "Choose a signature drink, if you want to provide drink that matches the theme of your party. This can be mixed in advance. For example, if it is a winter cocktail party, you can mix eggnog in advance and have it available for guests. If you are going to have a punch bowl, consider putting it on a table of its own, since the punchbowl and glasses can take up a lot of space."

      "content": "Make a list of the liquors, beer and wine you want to provide. If you want to have wine, choose a white and a red, but stay with the same type of wine so that the guests do not have to make more decisions. Consider stocking these staples that are common to a self-serve bar: vodka, rye whiskey, tequila, white rum, gin, and scotch or bourbon. If you are serving themed-drinks, buy other ingredients, such as Blue Cura√ßao or Irish Cream. Buy mixers, such as tonic water, club soda, cola, cranberry juice and other sodas."

The fourth and front row should have napkins, an ice bucket and tongs. Only keep 1 or 2 bottles of each liquor or wine out at once and restock as the night goes on."
