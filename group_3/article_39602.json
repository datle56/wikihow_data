      "content": "Use a signature that’s easy to read. If people can’t read your signature, they won’t be able to identify you as the artist. It's true that some famous artists have illegible signatures, but they can get away with it because a lot of people in the art world are familiar with them. If your signature is illegible, future owners of your painting will have a hard time finding out who you are. [3] X Research source Practice signing a legible signature on a piece of paper.

      "content": "Avoid using an eye-catching signature. A signature that is too bold can take away from the rest of your painting.

You can sign in the left or right bottom corner, although signing in the right bottom corner is more common. [6] X Expert Source Jeanine Hattas Wilson Professional Painter Expert Interview. 11 May 2021.

      "title": "Sign somewhere inside of the painting if you want a less obvious signature.",
      "content": "Sign somewhere inside of the painting if you want a less obvious signature. You could place your signature inside of an object in your painting, or have it going vertically up the side of something. If you do place your signature inside of your painting, make sure it blends in by keeping it small and using a color that matches the colors around it. [7] X Research source For example, if your painting features a bowl of apples, you could place your signature inside one of the apples and paint it a shade of red so it blends in."
