      "content": "Unexplained damage to your car Unexplained broken windows, scratches, damaged locks, or signs of forced entry often indicate that a thief has attempted to or successfully gained access to your car. Other evidence of tampering includes cut wires, removed alarms, or disabled immobilizers; these often indicate a thief has tried to disable your car’s security features and protection mechanisms.

      "title": "Missing items",
      "content": "Missing items If you notice any items you left in your car are missing or not where you left them, this could mean a thief gained access to your vehicle. Because they know it’s possible to get into your car, they may target it to do more damage later on."

      "title": "Suspicious individuals or vehicles",
      "content": "Suspicious individuals or vehicles If you notice strangers lingering around your vehicle, especially as if they’re monitoring it, it may be a sign your car is being targeted. Pay attention to any unfamiliar vehicles, as well, especially if unfamiliar people seem to be sitting inside for no reason for long periods of time. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Adjusted wing mirrors",
      "content": "Adjusted wing mirrors Pay attention to the placement of your wing mirror whenever you leave your car unattended. If you return to find it in a different position, it could mean your vehicle has been targeted. Thieves often reposition mirrors to signal to their accomplices because it isn’t typically noticeable unless you know what you’re looking for. [3] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Presence of chalk, marker, or gum",
      "content": "Presence of chalk, marker, or gum Thieves often use subtle signs to mark cars for later theft. Often, these signs will look like small coded messages or symbols with chalk or markers. Thieves may also leave chewed gum in specific places on or around the vehicle to indicate certain things, like whether the vehicle contains valuables or seems easy to break into. [4] X Research source You may also see small dots or lines drawn onto the bodywork of the car or stickers placed on the windows or headlights."

      "title": "Unusual electronic interference",
      "content": "Unusual electronic interference Car thieves sometimes use electronic devices to interfere with immobilizer or keyless entry systems. If you have difficulties starting or unlocking your car or if there’s unexpected interference when using your vehicle’s remote key, it could mean someone is targeting your vehicle. [5] X Research source Sometimes, you may also experience unusual car radio interference. However, technical issues and environmental factors could also be to blame, so this doesn’t guarantee your car is being targeted."

      "title": "Lock your doors.",
      "content": "Lock your doors. Though this may seem obvious, it can be easy to forget to lock your car after you exit the vehicle. Many thieves don’t bother with locked cars; it’s much easier for them to slip into an unlocked vehicle. Keeping your doors locked is one of the easiest ways to prevent theft. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Park in well-lit areas.",
      "content": "Park in well-lit areas. Thieves are more likely to target cars if they think they won’t get caught. Parking in well-lit areas, especially areas that have cameras, will likely help prevent theft. When you’re at home, try to park in a garage, driveway, or a secured car park. These areas are more likely to attract attention, so thieves generally leave them alone. [7] X Research source Keep your wheels facing the curb, as well. This positioning often deters thieves because it slows them down while attempting to steal the vehicle, which may attract unwanted attention. Thieves often target cars in public parking lots, gas stations, intersections, and near ATMs, so take extra precautions and lock your doors if you’re parked near these areas."

      "title": "Hide your valuables.",
      "content": "Hide your valuables. Thieves can easily look in your car’s windows, and if valuable items like purses, laptops, or phones are lying around, they’re more likely to try to break in. Don’t leave valuable items in your car overnight, and if you must leave them unattended, make sure they’re out of sight. [8] X Research source Don’t leave important paperwork in your car, either. For example, if you keep your car’s title and registration in the glovebox, a thief might get away with it if a cop pulls them over. Instead, keep these documents in a safe place in your house, like a safe."

      "content": "Don’t leave your car unattended. Thieves often look for signs of “puffing,” which refers to a vehicle that is left unattended while running. If you defrost or warm up your car in the morning, it’s easy for a thief to jump in and take it if the vehicle is unlocked. To avoid this, keep your car locked and don’t leave the key in the ignition. [9] X Research source"

      "title": "Don’t leave your windows cracked.",
      "content": "Don’t leave your windows cracked. Many people crack their windows to cool their cars down, especially on hot summer days. However, this provides an opportunity for potential thieves. Even though the opening is small, they can grab the top of the window and rock it so it’s off-track, which will then allow them to open it. Make sure all your windows are completely rolled up before leaving your vehicle. [10] X Research source"
