      "content": "Open the can from the bottom using a can opener . The majority of canned cranberry sauces are meant to be opened from the bottom of the can rather than the top. If you don’t have a can opener , you can also use a kitchen knife to perforate around the edge of the can’s bottom to pry it open. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Run a butter knife around the walls of the can to loosen the jelly.",
      "content": "Run a butter knife around the walls of the can to loosen the jelly. The cranberry sauce often gets stuck to the sides of the can. It will be easier to get it out if you run a knife between the jelly and the inside edges of the can. [3] X Research source Don’t destroy the cylindrical shape of the cranberry sauce jelly when you loosen it. You want it to retain its shape so you can slice it more cleanly."
    },
    {
      "title": "Slide the jelly gently onto a cutting board.",
      "content": "Slide the jelly gently onto a cutting board. Position the can over your cutting board and allow the sauce to drop out the bottom. Canned cranberry sauce resembles the can it was stored in, with ridged edges and a cylindrical shape. If you’re having trouble getting the sauce out of the can, you can cut two small holes in the top of the can with a knife, then put your mouth to the holes and suck in while you pull up on the can to help release the suction. [4] X Research source If you use this method, discard a slice of jelly from the top of the can to avoid spreading germs."

    {
      "title": "Slice the jelly cylinder into 1⁄4 inch (0.64 cm) rounds.",
      "content": "Slice the jelly cylinder into 1 ⁄ 4 inch (0.64 cm) rounds. Position the canned cranberry sauce horizontally on your cutting board. Use a knife to cut it into 1 ⁄ 4 inch (0.64 cm) slices. [5] X Research source You can repeat this process with as many cans of cranberry sauce as you’d like, depending on how many people you plan to feed. One 14 fl oz (410 mL) can of cranberry sauce contains approximately 6 servings."

    {
      "title": "Use a cookie cutter to shape the cranberry sauce, if desired.",
      "content": "Use a cookie cutter to shape the cranberry sauce, if desired. Once you’ve cut the jelly into slices, you can lay each slice flat on the cutting board and use a cookie cutter to create a shaped piece of jelly. This is optional, but can add a fun holiday flair to your canned cranberry sauce! [6] X Research source Choose seasonal cookie cutter shapes, like leaves in the fall or snowflakes in the winter. If your cookie cutter is small enough, you may be able to cut 2 shapes out of one slice of jelly. Make sure to position the cookie cutters to minimize excess sauce."

      "title": "Transfer each slice to a serving dish with a wide knife or spatula.",
      "content": "Transfer each slice to a serving dish with a wide knife or spatula. Slide the knife or spatula underneath each slice of jelly to move it from the cutting board to the dish. This will be easier than trying to pick up the slippery jelly with your hands. [7] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Arrange the slices on a serving platter.",
      "content": "Arrange the slices on a serving platter. If you have a long, narrow serving dish, lay out the slices in a straight line. Overlap each slice of cranberry sauce about halfway with the slice you just put down. If your dish is circular, lay the slices out in overlapping concentric circles. [8] X Research source If you cut the jelly with a cookie cutter, don’t overlap the different pieces. Lay them out across a plate so there’s some space in between, making it easier to identify the shapes."

      "content": "Place sugared rosemary sprigs on top of the cranberry sauce slices. Break apart some fresh rosemary into small sprigs. Dip the sprigs into water and lay them out on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Sprinkle them with 1 ⁄ 2 cup (120 mL) of sugar and allow them to dry. Garnish the cranberry sauce slices with the sugared sprigs of rosemary. [9] X Research source Use roughly 7 sprigs of rosemary to garnish 1 can’s worth of cranberry sauce slices. Try arranging them at alternating diagonal angles to create a zig-zag pattern."

      "content": "Top with fresh cranberries and rosemary for a pop of color. Arrange a few sprigs of rosemary on your serving platter for a touch of green against the red of the sliced cranberry sauce. Rinse off a handful of fresh cranberries and scatter those across the serving platter as well. [10] X Research source Make sure to pick out any mushy cranberries before you add them to the platter. Use roughly 7 sprigs of rosemary to garnish 1 can’s worth of cranberry sauce slices."

Then, sprinkle them along the top of your jelly slices, using approximately 2 strips of ginger per slice of cranberry sauce. You can buy premade candied ginger at most grocery stores. You can also make your own at home up to 3 months in advance. [11] X Research source"

      "content": "Chop orange zest and thyme, then sprinkle them on the cranberry sauce. Zest an orange using a grater or microplane. Mix the zest together with roughly 3 tablespoons (44 mL) of thyme leaves and chop them coarsely with a sharp knife. Dust the sliced cranberry sauce with this mixture so it’s spread evenly on top. [12] X Research source Make sure to rinse the thyme leaves before you chop them into the garnish. The orange of the zest against with the green of the thyme will create visual interest and dress up the cranberry sauce."

Juice the orange halves using your hands or a juicer. [13] X Research source Roll the oranges firmly across your counter or tabletop before you cut them to soften them and make them easier to juice."

Measure out 1 ⁄ 8 teaspoon (0.62 ml) cinnamon and 1 ⁄ 8 teaspoon (0.62 ml) nutmeg and add to the pan. Finally, toss in your orange juice and zest.

      "content": "Pour the sauce into a serving bowl and let it cool. Transfer the still-warm sauce into a bowl and allow it to cool for several minutes. The sauce will thicken a bit as it starts to cool down. This recipe makes about 15 fluid ounces (440 mL) of sauce. [17] X Research source Store the sauce in the bowl you plan to serve it in, which will make things simpler when you're ready to serve your meal."

When you’re ready to eat, just take the bowl out of the fridge and add a serving spoon. [18] X Research source This dish can be made up to 2 days in advance of your meal. This is a great way to spice up the flavor of canned cranberry sauce while still honoring a holiday tradition."
