      "content": "Review the four photos. These four photographs have something in common—a single word that fits into the squares below the images. Count the squares to find out how many letters are in the correct answer. Your selection of letters appears just below the blanks. For example, if a puzzle has two photographs of women with their arms in the air and two others of the sea, the common thread (thus the answer) would be \"wave.\" Sometimes the word will be obvious, while other times, it can pretty hard to guess. This is especially true of later levels."
