      "content": "Decide what kind of rope you want to buy. The type of rope you purchase will depend on your experience/fitness level and how you plan to use your jump rope. If you are a beginner jumper, then you may want to choose a cloth or beaded jump rope. These types of jump ropes turn more slowly and offer more control than PVC ropes, so they are a good choice for mastering form when you are just starting out. If you are an intermediate/fitness jumper, then you may want to choose a leather or PVC jump rope. These types of jump ropes are lightweight and they can move quickly for speed training. If you are an experienced/speed jumper, then you may want to choose a speed rope. Speed ropes are made of lightweight PVC and some speed ropes have ball bearings attached to the rope ends that help your rope turn even more quickly."

      "title": "Select the right length.",
      "content": "Select the right length. You will need to buy a rope that is about 2-3 feet longer than your height. If you have trouble deciding between two lengths, go for the longer one. You are better off buying a rope that is too long than one that is too short. Remember that you can always reduce the length but you cannot add to it."

      "content": "Step on your jump rope with one foot. Make sure that your foot is on the center of your jump rope. Pull on your rope handles and check the alignment of your handles to see if they are even. If they are not even, lift up your foot slightly and adjust the rope until your handles are even. Hold up both jump rope handles as high as they will go. Both handles should be vertical and the rope should be taut. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Check the location of your handles in the mirror.",
      "content": "Check the location of your handles in the mirror. Look and see where the tops of your handles align with your body. If the rope is above your shoulder line, then it is too long and you will need to adjust it. For beginners, the tops of your rope handles should be just below your shoulder line but above your armpit. This length is ideal for kids and beginners because it will swing around more slowly than a shorter rope. For fitness jumpers, the tops of your rope handles should be aligned with your armpit. This length is ideal for fitness jumpers because your rope will move quickly and it will be easier to control than the longer length. This length is also ideal for doing double unders, which is known as one of the most difficult CrossFit moves. Double unders are easier if your rope is well-sized [3] X Research source For experienced speed jumpers, the tops of your rope handles should be an inch or two below your armpits.This length is ideal for speed jumpers because your rope will move quickly with less effort and it will be easier to control."

      "content": "Adjust the length of your rope. If your jump rope is too long, you will need to adjust the length. There are a couple of different ways to adjust the length of your jump rope. The easiest way to adjust your jump ropeâ€™s size is by tying a knot or a couple of knots in the rope. Tie the knot as close to the handle as you can without letting the knot actually touch the handle. If you need more than one knot to adjust the size, tie one knot (or two) on each side of the rope. This method is best for beaded and cloth ropes."

If you can jump rope in front of a large mirror, that is ideal. If not, ask a friend to watch you. As you jump rope, notice the distance between the top of your head and the middle of your rope. For beginner jumpers, this distance should be about 16-30 inches. For fitness jumpers, this distance should be about 6-10 inches. For speed jumpers, this distance should be about 2-6 inches.

If you will be crimping the end of the rope with a clamp that was included with your jump rope, then you can leave a little less length.
