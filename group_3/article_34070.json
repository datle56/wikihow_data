      "content": "Cut blooming flowers in your garden during the summer. Choose flowers in full bloom so you can preserve the rich color of the petals or blossoms. For best results, pick your flowers in the morning, and move the fresh-cut flowers from the sunlight as quickly as possible.

You can also use flowers that bloom in the winter, such as Hellebore, Winter Jasmine, and Algerian Iris."

      "content": "Select healthy flowers that are free of insects and disease. Avoid choosing flowers with brown spots or uneven sections.

      "content": "Cut the stem so it is at least 6 in (15 cm) and remove extra foliage. Using pruning shears, make a cut at a 45-degree angle along the main stem of your flower. Then, use your fingers to pick off some of the extra leaves and greenery. You can leave 2-4 leaves to add some color to your bouquet. [2] X Research source If you cut your flower stem less than 6 in (15 cm) long, it may be too small to display in a vase. You can use 1 single flower or many flowers, based on your desired look."

      "content": "Tie a piece of dental floss to the ends of each flower or bouquet. Cut a piece of dental floss about 12–16 in (30–41 cm) long. Secure the piece of dental floss to the stem of an individual flower. Additionally, you can wrap a rubber band around a small bouquet of 3-6 flowers, and then tie the dental floss to the ends of the bouquet. [3] X Research source If you don’t have dental floss, you can use twine instead. Make 2-3 knots so the floss stays in place."

Tie 2-3 basic knots so the dental floss stays put. Hang each of your flowers along the bottom of the same hanger until you run out of space. [4] X Research source For instance, secure 3 bouquets of 4 flowers to the bottom of 1 hanger."

They will lose pigment and shrink up a little once they're dry. The petals will be crispy and break off easily, so handle them carefully! [5] X Research source"

In addition, you can spray a light layer over the blooms and stems while the flowers are still in the vase."
