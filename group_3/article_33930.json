      "title": "Purchase TVP.",
      "content": "Purchase TVP. TVP looks like dried cereal and may be purchased in plastic bags or resealable containers. It has a long shelf life and can be found in your grocery store's health food section or with other bulk foods. Textured vegetable protein in a non-sealed sack has a shelf life of about a year, but textured vegetable protein in an airtight container will last much longer. Because textured vegetable protein is made from soybeans, the cost of the product is relatively inexpensive. You can purchase flavored TVP, either dry or frozen, which can be heated and added to a number of dishes. However, since TVP is so easy to cook with and flavor yourself, it's best to start with dried TVP free of additives and flavors. That way, you can add whatever spices and flavors you want, without the extra chemicals."

      "title": "Measure out your TVP in a bowl.",
      "content": "Measure out your TVP in a bowl. Ground beef cooks down and shrinks when you apply heat, but since TVP gains volume when you reconstitute it, it will stretch a lot further. To make a meal that will feed 2 - 4 people, you'll need about 2 cups of dry TVP."
    },
    {
      "title": "Add hot water.",
      "content": "Add hot water. The ratio of water to TVP should be 1:1. To reconstitute the TVP, you simply add hot water and let it sit for 5 - 10 minutes. The TVP will begin to fluff and take on the texture of ground beef. If you'd prefer, you can simply add the TVP to a pot of soup or a sauce that contains plenty of liquid. The TVP will reconstitute as part of the dish - there's no need to do it separately. If you're working with larger pieces of TVP, such as TVP cutlets, you might want to squeeze the reconstituted pieces so they aren't full of excess water."
    },
    {
      "title": "Add spices and seasonings.",
      "content": "Add spices and seasonings. Now that you have a bowl of reconstituted TVP, use it as a canvas to add your favorite spices, just the way you would any other protein. You can season it with a simple mixture of salt and pepper, give it Italian flair with some oregano and sage, or make it spicy with cayenne."

    {
      "title": "Use the TVP as part of a meal.",
      "content": "Use the TVP as part of a meal. You can make TVP tacos or enchiladas, TVP chili, TVP burgers - the sky's the limit. Once the TVP has been reconstituted, simply use it as a filling the same way you'd do with ground beef. You can brown the TVP if you want to maximize the flavor. Try reconstituting it with stock or broth instead of plain water."

    {
      "title": "Toss out leftover TVP.",
      "content": "Toss out leftover TVP. TVP lasts a long time on the shelf when it's still dry, but once you reconstitute it, the mixture won't keep for long."

    {
      "title": "Make TVP burgers.",
      "content": "Make TVP burgers. If you have a craving for a hearty burger, TVP serves as a great substitute for ground beef or bison. Serve it with a side of chips or fries for a classic, meat-free meal. Reconstitute 2 cups of TVP in vegetable broth. Mix in salt and pepper to taste. Add soy sauce and ketchup to taste. Mix in one egg (to bind the TVP). Mix in 1/4 cup flour. Form the mixture into patties. Bake them in the oven at 350 degrees for 10 - 15 minutes, until they're brown and crispy."

      "title": "Make TVP chili.",
      "content": "Make TVP chili. TVP is a great ingredient to use in chilis and soups - you don't even have to reconstitute it first. Simply make your favorite chili recipe without the meat, and add dried TVP once the liquid has come to a simmer, toward the end of the cooking process. In 10 minutes, the TVP will be reconstituted and your meal will be ready to enjoy."
