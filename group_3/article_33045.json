      "content": "Pull the Pull It button to set the game mode. Pulling the knob once turns on the Bop It and causes it to start talking. Pull it repeatedly to switch between solo, pass it, party, and one-on-one mode. The game is automatically set to solo mode at first, so you don’t have to change it if you’re playing on your own. [1] X Research source After about 3 minutes of doing nothing, Bop It goes into sleep mode. Use the Pull it button to reactivate it again."

      "content": "Move the Flick It lever to adjust the difficulty setting. Bop It comes with 3 different difficulty settings. Beginner mode is where you start when you want to play the game normally. Expert level switches the voice commands to sound effects. Finally, master mode is a challenging mode that uses both sound effects and color commands. [2] X Research source Note that you can unlock the harder modes by scoring 100 points in the mode preceding it. For example, score 100 points in beginner mode to unlock expert mode. Since there are so many models of Bop It, the difficulty levels may vary depending on the one you own. The Extreme 2, for instance, has a voice command (vox bop) mode and a sound effect (beat bop) mode. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Turn the Spin It button to adjust the game’s volume.",
      "content": "Turn the Spin It button to adjust the game’s volume. Listen to the Bop It to determine which voice setting you want. It has 3 settings: low, medium, and high. The default is usually medium, but you might want to turn it up if you’re playing with others or turn it down if you’re playing quietly on your own. Modern models of Bop It have a headphone jack near the Bop It button. Plug headphones in for a more personal way to play that doesn’t disturb anyone around you."

      "title": "Rotate the Twist It button to hear the current high score.",
      "content": "Rotate the Twist It button to hear the current high score. Bop It records your playing scores! It saves the best score for solo mode only, so you won’t be able to check your scores from multiplayer games. It tells you the highest score for the difficulty mode you have selected, which you can adjust first with the Flick It command. [4] X Research source With a standard Bop It, you unlock higher difficulties by scoring 100 points on the previous level. For that reason, the high score on the lower difficulties will always be 100. Some newer models of Bop It allow you to play past 100 points. Some have a maximum score as high as 250 or 1,000 points."

      "content": "Hit the Bop It button to start a new game. Once you have the mode and difficulty set, all you have to do is push the big button in the center to start playing. You will hear the Bop It play a brief tune and then start giving commands for you to follow. Be prepared to follow the commands as soon as you hit the button! [5] X Research source If you don’t choose a mode and difficulty, Bop It defaults to the last settings you used. If you haven’t played recently, it defaults to the beginner difficulty or voice command mode."

      "content": "Press the button in the center when you hear “bop it.” The Bop It button can be black, white, or green depending on the version you own. It is always labeled and positioned in the center, so it’s easy to find. Hold onto the game’s handles, then reach in with one hand to tap the button. Move your hand back to the handle afterward to prepare for the next command. [6] X Research source Remember that the commands change on higher difficulty settings. Instead of “bop it,” expect to hear a drum sound effect or a color, usually white or black. The Bop It button is typically double-sided. In solo mode, the side you use isn’t important. It matters in multiplayer, though."

Activate it by pulling it away from the Bop It. If you were fast enough, the Bop It will give you a point and move on to the next command. [7] X Research source The Flick It lever is also represented by a “boing” sound effect on higher difficulties."

Then, move your hand back up to the hand grip before the next command plays. [8] X Research source The “wobbling wheel” sound effect stands for “spin it” on higher difficulties. Note that some Bop Its call the wheel orange instead of red during color command mode."

      "content": "Twist the yellow handle when you hear “twist it.” The Twist It button is on the upper left side of the game. This one can be a little tricky since it varies depending on the type of Bop It you have. Traditionally, it is a yellow knob that looks like a cyclone. Sometimes it is an orange cap you have to grab and rotate. [9] X Research source On sound effect mode, the corresponding sound effect is a cranking sound. The creators call it a “low-pitched ratchet.” The Twist It knob is usually yellow and is called yellow in the color command mode. Be aware of the difference if your model happens to have an orange button instead."

      "content": "Slide the blue lever out when you hear the “pull it” command. The Pull It button is a big knob sticking out from the bottom-left part of the Bop It. Grasp it with your left hand and pull it away from your body. The Bop It will then play a sound effect and give you a point. Put your hand back on the hand grip for the next command. [10] X Research source The “pull it” sound effect is on a slide whistle. For most players, it is one of the easiest ones to remember during an intense game."

      "content": "Shake the Bop It if your version has a “shake it” command. This command isn’t available on all Bop Its, but some of the newer ones include it. Unlike with the other commands, there isn’t a button to press. Instead, firmly grasp the hand grips and shake the entire device up and down. Don’t worry, you won’t damage it, and the game will soon move on to the next command. [11] X Research source ”Shake it” is represented by a cowbell during sound effects mode. ”Shake it” was introduced in 2010 with the Bop It! XT. If you have a version made after 2010, it most likely will include this command."

      "title": "Speak into the microphone when the “shout it” it command is given.",
      "content": "Speak into the microphone when the “shout it” it command is given. Some versions of the game have a built-in microphone. It is typically located right above the Bop It button. When you hear “shout it,” raise the Bop It toward your mouth and say something out loud. Be quick, since the game only waits a few seconds. [12] X Research source It doesn’t really matter what you shout into the microphone. If you don’t feel like shouting, try blowing into it. During a sound effects mode, the “shout it” command becomes a scratching sound from a DJ’s turntables. The “shout it” command was introduced in the early 2010s. Most later versions have it. However, the command is typically optional depending on the game mode chosen."

      "content": "Perform the correct motion when you hear commands like “saw it.” Some versions of the game have a bunch of new, unique actions to perform. The new actions are whip it, drink it, selfie it, comb it, answer it, and saw it, hammer it, cradle it, sing it, and golf it. Move the Bop It to mimic each command given by the game. [13] X Research source For example, if you’re told to golf it, swing the Bop It like a golf club. For selfie it, hold it in front of you like it’s a camera. Bop It! New Moves was released in 2016. Another version called Bop It! Maker from 2017 has some additional actions and allows you to record custom moves."

      "content": "Pick solo mode if you’re playing on your own. As the default mode, playing solo is great when you’re on your own. It includes several difficulty modes toggled by Flick It lever. If you’re unfamiliar with the game, try starting with solo mode to get used to the various commands. The game ends after you make a mistake or reach 100 points. [14] X Research source Note that Bop It doesn’t have a pause button, so you can’t stop mid-game. Solo mode can also be a good way to get other people involved. Take turns and see who gets the higher score!"

      "content": "Choose pass it mode if you’re playing with multiple people. This mode is meant for 2 or more people. One person starts with the Bop It and plays as they normally would. When you hear the voice say “pass it,” give it to the player on your left. Keep playing until only one person is left. [15] X Research source In pass it mode, you get eliminated when you make a mistake or don’t react fast enough. The next person can continue the game by pressing the Bop It button."

The person on the left is responsible for the Twist It and Pull It buttons. The person on the right handles the Flick It and Spin It buttons. Keep the game going as long as you can or try to outlast the other player. [16] X Research source Bop It Extreme has a built-in one-on-one mode. It has a yellow and green Bop It button. The player on the left presses the yellow side while the person on the right hits the green side."

      "title": "Hit buttons with your body in party mode if your Bop It has it.",
      "content": "Hit buttons with your body in party mode if your Bop It has it. Party mode is a unique multiplayer mode built into the Bop It XT and other models. In this mode, the voice suddenly shouts out a body part. You have to hit the Bop It button with that part. It’s a little silly, but it’s a fun challenge at a party. [17] X Research source For example, it might say “elbow.” Hit the button with your elbow. Everyone else should be watching to make sure you follow the instructions."
