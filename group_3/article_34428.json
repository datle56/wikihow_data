      "content": "Verify that marriage is the next step for both of you. Reflect back on what she’s said about marriage in the past to make sure it’s something she wants. You can also gauge her feelings by bringing up your plans for the future. [1] X Research source If she’s planning a future with you, she’s probably going to say “yes” when you pop the question. Chatting with her friends and family can also help. They know her really well, so they can reassure you that it’s time to propose. Your girlfriend might express doubts about getting married or could even say marriage isn’t something she wants. If that happens, hold off on proposing and instead talk about both of your expectations for your relationship. If you’ve only been together a few months, you might wait a little longer to make sure you’re both wanting a long-term relationship."

      "content": "Tell her parents you plan to propose before you pop the question. These days, you don’t have to ask for permission to marry her—unless that’s what she wants. At the same time, her parents will really appreciate it if you let them know that you love their daughter and plan to propose. Plus, they might be able to give you some insights into what their daughter will like best. [2] X Research source “I just wanted to let you know that I love your daughter with all my heart, and I’m planning to ask her to be my wife.” “Your daughter means the world to me, and I can’t imagine life without her. I wanted to tell you that I’m planning to propose.” Some people find this old-fashioned, so don’t worry about talking to your girlfriend’s parents if it’s not important to her or if she doesn’t have a great relationship with them."

Get ideas for what she likes by checking out her current jewelry, or ask one of her besties to come along. To get her size, take a ring that she typically wears on her ring finger when you go to pick out her engagement ring. [3] X Research source If you’ve been talking about marriage, ask her to show you rings that she likes. You might even visit a few jewelry stores so she can point out the rings she likes best. Additionally, ask her what size you should get. Be sure to hide the ring somewhere she won’t find it. You don’t want to ruin the surprise!"

You might feel more comfortable on a secluded beach than at a crowded restaurant, and that’s totally okay. You can propose practically anywhere, so go with a spot that feels special to you. [6] X Research source Here are some ideas: The beach at sunset. At her favorite restaurant. On a scenic hike. On a fancy vacation. Where you had your first date. At home in a candlelight dinner. On a bridge under the stars. At the top of a landmark. On a romantic picnic. In a hot air balloon. On a camping trip. At a sporting event. In a botanical garden. At the aquarium. In a museum.

Every day with you is a new adventure, and I can’t wait to see what tomorrow unfolds. You bring out the best in me: you challenge me, you see my talents, you encourage me. I hope that I can be as great a partner to you as you are to me. I want to spend all my days with you, making you the happiest woman on earth. I love you so much, and I just have one question. Will you marry me?”"

Tell your photographer how you plan to propose and their cue to start taking photos.

[8] X Trustworthy Source American Psychological Association Leading scientific and professional organization of licensed psychologists Go to source Some people choose to skip the photographer, and that’s okay! You and your future fiance might prefer to keep the moment private. If you hire a professional, you might go ahead and take some engagement photos for when you announce your nuptials."

You don’t want to ruin the surprise! [10] X Research source “Hey, babe. I got us reservations at that new Italian place this Friday. Let’s get dressed up and have a date night.” “I just found out about a big work event this Saturday.

It’ll still sound perfect to her. “Lately, I’ve been thinking about how much better my life is since we first met. I still remember the first time I saw you. You had foam on your nose from your latte, and it was so cute. I’m so grateful for the joy you bring to my life and for all the ways you’ve helped me become my best self.
