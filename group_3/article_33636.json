      "content": "Explain the dangers your kids face while online. You probably don’t want to scare your children, but they need to understand why Internet safety is important. Tell your children that online predators exist and that it’s really hard to spot who they are. Encourage your children to stay cautious anytime they’re online. [1] X Research source If you have young children, say something like, “You’re going to meet a lot of nice people online, but unfortunately, some people may want to hurt you. Since it’s hard to tell who is nice and who isn’t, treat everyone you meet online like a stranger.” If your child is older, you might say, “I know you’re really smart about the Internet, but it might still be hard for you to realize when someone is trying to trick you. I want you to be safe, so I expect you to follow my rules.”"

      "content": "Set rules so your kids are empowered to make good choices. Your rules will give your child guidelines about what’s okay when it comes to going online. Tell your child what you expect from them and why. Here are some rules you might set: [2] X Research source Ask your child to only friend people they know in real life. Require your kids to get approval before friending someone they don’t know. Limit what your child is allowed to post. Specify times your child can be online.

      "content": "Discuss that people may pretend to be someone they’re not. People can be anyone they want online, and some people use this opportunity to take advantage of others. Talk to your kids about this possibility and teach them to be skeptical of what people tell them online. Ask them to get your help in determining if someone is trustworthy. [3] X Trustworthy Source State of Michigan Official website for the State of Michigan Go to source For younger children, say, “People can lie about how old they are when they’re online. That means a grown-up can say they’re a child, like you. Always check with me when you add a new friend so I can help you figure out if they’re safe.” For older kids, say, “You probably know that people can lie online, but it’s really hard to figure out when someone is pretending to be someone they’re not. Please tell me when you meet someone new so I can help you stay safe.”"

      "content": "Help your kids pick good screen names. Your child’s screen name should protect their privacy, but it’s important to pick a name that won’t attract a predator. Unfortunately, names that are sexually suggestive or that indicate the age of your child might draw a predator to your child. To protect your kids, make them get your approval before they post a screen name. [5] X Research source Use your child’s interests to help them find a screen name. After you and your child have a few ideas, pick a name that could be used by an adult or a child."

      "content": "Set strong passwords with your kids. Teach your child to incorporate multiple words, capital and lowercase letters, and numbers or symbols into their passwords.

[6] X Research source Say, “A good password is hard for someone to guess. Try using a phrase, capital letters, numbers, or symbols to make your password super hard to figure out.” A good password might be “CoFFeeSandWich540” or “nap$oN$@today.”"

      "title": "Explain that images posted online are on the Internet forever.",
      "content": "Explain that images posted online are on the Internet forever. Since children’s brains aren’t fully formed, it’s really hard for them to understand long-term consequences. Because of this, they may make a split-second decision to post a photo online that will haunt them forever. Talk to your child about what pictures are okay to post and why they shouldn’t post revealing or suggestive photos. [7] X Research source You might say, “While it’s your choice what you do with your body, please don’t post nude or revealing photos of yourself or share them online. Once these photos are out there, you can’t get them back, and some people may misuse them in ways you don’t like.” Tell your child to come to you if they accidentally share a revealing photo or if someone tries to get them to provide one. You might say, “I am on your side at all times and promise you won’t get in trouble if you ask for help. Please come to me.” Try not to judge your child for taking photos you think are too revealing. It’s normal for them to want to explore and celebrate their body. Keep the focus on making safe decisions."

This allows you to make sure they aren’t doing anything that may be unsafe. Compare available apps and use the one that fits your needs. [11] X Research source You might try an app like Net Nanny, Qustodio, MamaBear, OurPact, or Kaspersky Safe Kids. Some of these apps offer a free plan, but you may have to pay for protection.

[12] X Research source Periodically review the content to make sure it’s still okay. Read reviews and ratings if they’re available.
