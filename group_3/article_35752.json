      "content": "Set up an account on an online genealogy research service. Online genealogy research services provide tools that will help you access records and organize the information you find. While these services typically require you to purchase a subscription, many public libraries have accounts that allow you to access them for free and set up your own profile. [1] X Research source Online genealogy research services also may have access to digital records that you wouldn't be able to get otherwise. This can be particularly helpful with older records."

      "content": "Start with yourself and work backward through your family. Search for records dealing with your parents, then move on to your grandparents, great-grandparents, and so on. Closed adoptions may seem like a dead-end but there are ways you can work around them to trace your ancestry. [2] X Research source Keep in mind that if someone was adopted, their adoptive parents would not be considered your biological ancestors. You need to find their biological parents or other biological relatives, such as aunts or uncles, who can help you trace your lineage. Some adoption records also include information about tribal membership."

      "title": "Talk to family members about your Native American ancestry.",
      "content": "Talk to family members about your Native American ancestry. Often, family stories will be the source of your belief that you have Native American ancestry. Digging into those stories can help you uncover details about family members that you may not have known. Those details, in turn, can help you fill out your family tree. [3] X Research source If you have access to older family members, they're more likely to have documents, photographs, and other information that may lead you to uncover the identity of your Native American ancestors."

      "title": "Check local court and other public records.",
      "content": "Check local court and other public records. You may not be able to fill out your full family tree online. Public records can help you connect ancestors, particularly those who lived locally. Many of these records required Native Americans to register their ethnicities. [4] X Research source For example, if you have an ancestor who was adopted, you may be able to find the court adoption order for them. That adoption order may include information about the tribe they came from. If you had ancestors who live in a different area, check the court's website or the state's public records office. You might be able to order records online or over the phone, which would save you a trip to search in person."

      "content": "Search for your ancestor on the Dawes Commission Rolls. Finding a Native American ancestor isn't enough if you want to register as a Native American. You must also be able to point to their name on the Dawes Commission Rolls. Many online genealogy research services have access to the Rolls. You can also access the Dawes Rolls on the National Archives website at https://www.archives.gov/research/native-americans/dawes . The Tulsa Library has a searchable index of the Dawes Rolls, as well as other resources for researching your Native American ancestry, at https://www.tulsalibrary.org/research/genealogy-center/american-indian-research ."

      "content": "Fill out your CDIB card application. The CDIB card application requires you to recreate your family tree, tracing your lineage back to your Native American ancestors. If any of your ancestors were adopted, you will need to list the names of their biological parents if you know them. Include as much information as possible. Your application is more likely to be approved if you have complete information about your ancestors. You may have ancestors who were enrolled in different tribes. If so, you must list each of these tribes on your CDIB card application. However, you can only apply for tribal membership with one tribe."

You can expect to pay between $15 and $30 for each certificate you order. These certificates will not be returned to you. Most birth and death certificates can be ordered online through the VitalChek service. If there's a certificate you can't get online, check with the vital records department of the state where the person lived.

It's a good idea to make a copy of everything for your records before you mail it. [5] X Research source BIA agency offices are included on the tribal leaders directory, available online at https://www.bia.gov/bia/ois/tribal-leaders-directory/ . If you are potentially eligible for citizenship in more than one tribe, you'll need to pick the one you want to enroll in.

Expect this process to take several months depending on the complexity of your family tree. Once the investigation is complete, you'll get a CDIB in the mail at the address you provided on your application.

However, depending on the citizenship requirements, you may have to provide additional information. Applications are typically available online or you can call the tribal leadership office and request a paper application in the mail. If you're eligible for citizenship in more than one tribe, you typically have to sign a form rejecting citizenship in any other tribe.

Typically, the tribe conducts its own investigation into your lineage, then the tribal leadership votes on whether to accept your citizenship. [11] X Research source You'll typically receive a letter in the mail letting you know of the tribe's decision. Some tribes may require you to attend an interview with tribal leadership before your application is finally approved. Many tribes have ceremonies you can attend to be officially welcomed into the tribe. You'll also get information about any services you are now eligible for by virtue of your tribal membership."
