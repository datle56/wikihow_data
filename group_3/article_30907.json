      "title": "Virgo Midheavens approach their careers with an organized mind.",
      "content": "Virgo Midheavens approach their careers with an organized mind. Your Midheaven speaks to your career, accomplishments, and legacy, and always sits at the beginning of your 10th House—the House that symbolizes your career and public image. When Virgo fills the Midheaven position on your chart, you tend to have a great work ethic, pay close attention to the details, and always put a ton of hard work and effort into everything you do. With this placement, you also don’t care much about being the center of attention; if anything, you often prefer staying behind the scenes. [1] X Research source To sum things up, Virgo Midheavens have their 10th House in Virgo. Some birth charts may label your Midheaven as “MC,” which is an abbreviation of the Latin phrase “medium coeli,” or “middle of the sky.” [2] X Research source This makes sense, seeing as your Midheaven sits in the very center of your birth chart. Not totally sure what your Midheaven sign is? Double-check by plugging your birth info into this calculator . (You’ll need to know your birth time to get an accurate birth chart.)"

      "title": "Detail-oriented",
      "content": "Detail-oriented Other people like to focus on the big picture. As a Virgo Midheaven, though, you like to focus on the little details—in fact, you absolutely thrive on them. You’re most in your element when you’re focusing on singular tasks; on some occasions, you can even get lost in your own world as you focus on the minuscule details of a particular assignment. Tip: Create time limits for yourself when you’re working on certain tasks in the workplace. Allow yourself to focus on something for a set amount of time, and then switch gears once that time limit is up."

      "title": "Perfectionist",
      "content": "Perfectionist Perfectionism is a common trait associated with the Virgo sign in general—and being a Virgo Midheaven is no exception. As a Virgo MC, you like to do (and have things done) in a very certain way and to a very particular standard. If that standard isn’t met, you aren’t afraid to try again and again until these standards are met. Tip: Creating a checklist can be a helpful way to keep your perfectionism in check by reminding you of other tasks that need to be completed. It can also help to modify your standards for a certain assignment, like dedicating 2 hours to a task that you might normally dedicate 4 hours to.

      "title": "Demanding",
      "content": "Demanding A key part of being a Virgo Midheaven is knowing exactly what type of work you expect from yourself, especially at the workplace. Oftentimes, though, these expectations transfer over to the people you work with, too. You aren’t trying to get on anyone’s bad side, though—you just want to see people doing the best work they possibly can (even if you’re holding them up to your standards). Tip: Practicing a little empathy can go a long way when it comes to working with others! Try to put yourself in the other person’s shoes to better understand the way they’re approaching a task before expecting them to perform it in a specific way."

      "title": "Rational",
      "content": "Rational As a Virgo Midheaven, you don’t think theoretically at the workplace; instead, you approach most problems in your career with a specific, actionable, and intentional perspective.

Tip: While it’s great that you take such a practical approach to life, there’s nothing wrong with letting your imagination soar . Sometimes, it helps to tackle problems with a more open-minded and unconventional perspective!"

    {
      "title": "Self-conscious",
      "content": "Self-conscious As a Virgo Midheaven, you’re often on your guard, especially when it comes to how other people publicly perceive you. It’s easy for you to overthink how you interact with others, or stress that you’ve somehow said or done the wrong thing in your interactions. In fact, you might even avoid spending time in the public eye with other people since you don’t want to be perceived in the wrong way. Tip: Try approaching social interactions in baby steps, whether that’s texting a friend or posting a friendly status update on social media. It’s totally okay to stay private, but you shouldn’t isolate yourself from the world, either!"

Tip: Don’t feel like you have to imitate someone else’s life routine—instead, make a routine that’s accessible and feasible to you. While each and every person needs to incorporate healthy meals, exercise, and sleep into their schedule, it’s important to incorporate these things in a way that’s completely specific to you (like making time for a long walk versus going to the gym)."

Try to afford yourself that same sense of compassion during difficult times."
