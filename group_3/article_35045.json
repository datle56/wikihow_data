Visit auction houses, check pawn shops, and see if there are any card show events or conventions near you.

These cards are then sealed for protection and given a certificate of authenticity. This helps reassure buyers that they’re getting what they paid for, so graded cards are typically more valuable than ungraded cards, even if they’re in the same condition. [21] X Research source Some collectors also prefer certain grading companies. For example, cards that are PSA-graded usually go for a higher price because the company is well-recognized."
