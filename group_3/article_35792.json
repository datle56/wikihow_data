      "content": "Eat more foods rich in dietary fiber. Dietary fiber is a portion of plant-based foods that your body can neither digest nor absorb. Fiber helps move material through your digestive tract and also adds bulk to your bowel movements, but of which can help regulate your bowels. [3] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Though your diet should include a solid mix of both, dietary fiber comes in two forms—soluble and insoluble. Soluble dietary fiber means that the fiber is water-soluble, the mix of which creates a gel-like substance that can help promote the movement of material through your bowels. Since this fiber absorbs water, it also cuts down on runny stools by solidifying them. Foods rich in soluble fiber include oats, peas, beans (navy, pinto, black, kidney), apples, citrus fruits, carrots, barley, and psyllium. Insoluble fiber is not water-soluble, so it helps add bulk to stool, which helps maintain regular movement of your bowels. Foods rich in insoluble fiber include whole wheat flour, wheat bran, nuts (pecans, almonds, Brazil nuts), beans, and vegetables (such as cauliflower, green beans, leafy greens, and potatoes). Your suggested amount of daily fiber depends on your sex and age. Men and women age 50 and under should aim for 38 and 25 grams per day, respectively. Men and women over age 50 should consume 30 and 21 grams per day, respectively. A high-fiber diet can help you fight constipation-predominant IBS. With this type of diet, you might eat 3-5 servings of fruits and veggies a day, and switch over to whole grains.

[6] X Research source While most of your fluid should come from water, you can also include fruit and vegetable juices, as well as clear soup broths to meet your daily requirements. Some medical conditions (such as congestive heart failure) will require you to restrict your fluid intake. [7] X Research source Consult your doctor regarding your acceptable level of fluid intake before making any changes if you have a condition where you fluids have been restricted. Dehydration is also associated with a condition known as “retentive constipation,” especially in children.

Jan 19 (1) 35-47. With this condition, initial constipation due to dry, hardened stool is worsened by stagnating in the colon/rectum where additional water is drawn out, hardening it even further. This can lead to a vicious cycle of irregularity."

      "content": "Check any medications you’re taking. Narcotic pain medications, some antidepressants, some anticonvulsants, aluminum-containing antacids, and some blood pressure medications are just a few examples of medications that commonly lead to constipation and irregularity. You should always consult your doctor before making any changes to a prescription regimen, but in some cases your doctor may be able to switch you to a drug without constipation as a side effect. If you currently take narcotic pain relievers, then getting plenty of fluids and moving around frequently can help to promote peristalsis. Peristalsis is the wave like motions of your colon that helps to move waste through your body and promote bowel movements. If you have recently has surgery and are taking narcotic pain relievers, then you may be encouraged by your surgical care team to take a stool softener along with the pain medication to reduce your chance of becoming constipated."

You doctor will likely recommend one of these options if a necessary medication has caused your irregularity. However, you can also use these options as directed even when a medication is not the cause. Just be sure to check with your doctor first if you have a chronic GI condition. OTC options include: [14] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source Osmotic agents - These options (such as Milk of Magnesia and Miralax) help stool retain fluid usually absorbed by the digestive tract, easing the passage of bowel movements. Stool softeners - These products (including Colace and Docusate) mix fluid with your stool to soften them and ease passage. Doctors especially recommend these options for those who strain during bowel movements or for women who suffer from constipation after childbirth. Lubricants - Lubricants (such as Fleet and Zymenol) coat stool, helping it to retain fluid and move more easily down the lower digestive tract. Stimulants - These options (which include Dulcolax and Correctol) contract the intestines, causing them to move stool more quickly through your intestinal tract. Though available over the counter, you should reserve stimulants as a last resort for severe cases, and you should avoid stimulants containing phenolphthalein.
