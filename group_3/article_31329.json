      "content": "It’s a proverb that suggests meeting your idols can lead to disappointment. “Never meet your heroes” is a piece of advice that means people shouldn’t meet their heroes because they may be disappointed by the hero’s true personality. This happens because people tend to idealize people they look up to instead of viewing them as multifaceted humans with flaws, and they may have unrealistic expectations about what will happen when they meet their hero. [1] X Research source The hero might not have the time, energy, or interest in meeting their expectations, destroying the perfect image that person has built in their head. The logic behind this proverb is that many celebrities craft public personas, and the image they portray online or on camera may be vastly different from how they act in real life. With that being said, some people say that meeting your heroes can be a positive experience and serve as a reminder that heroes are no different than normal people."

      "content": "“Never meet your heroes” has existed since the 19th century. While the exact origins of the “never meet your heroes” are unclear, the concept has been featured in literature for centuries. One of the earliest accounts of the phrase is from Madame Bovary , a French novel by Gustave Flaubert. The original French quote is “Il ne faut pas toucher aux idoles: la dorure en reste aux mains,” which translates to “Don’t touch your idols: a little gold always rubs off.” [2] X Research source The phrase became more widespread in the 20th century, since fans would often share stories of meeting their heroes and being let down. Musicians, actors, and other celebrities have also shared the sentiment in interviews, warning people not to put others on a pedestal."

      "content": "You can learn to see them as normal people with weaknesses. Even if you don’t have a positive or memorable experience with your hero, meeting them can remind you that everyone has things they can improve on. Humans are complex, multifaceted beings, and putting anyone on a pedestal is unhealthy. [3] X Research source Seeing your hero’s flaws and vulnerabilities can lower your expectations of others, plus make you more forgiving of your own imperfections. For example, if you meet a singer and they are rude to you, it can remind you not to idolize them. You can either learn to separate the art from the artist, or stop supporting them."

      "content": "You might be able to ask them questions and get advice. If you’re lucky, your hero could be just as amazing as you envisioned them to be, and you may be able to get their wisdom and insights. Meeting them in real life gives you the rare opportunity to ask them questions about how to overcome challenges and get to where they are in their career. For example, if you’re a film student, you could ask an actor about how they handle creative differences on set or how they handle rejection."

      "content": "You might be able to build a relationship with them. Sometimes, you can meet someone and form an instant connection with them. This may spark a friendship or mentorship, and lead to new opportunities in your career. Meeting your hero, in this case, is just like networking —you form a positive, genuine connection with them and are able to gain contacts, information, and experiences. For example, if you’re running a podcast and have an amazing conversation with an author, you could ask them to connect on LinkedIn and invite them for an interview."
