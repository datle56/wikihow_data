You are granting authority to a third party (a proxy) to act on your behalf, but the letter should be addressed to second party (the one with whom you and your proxy are dealing). You may have to leave this portion blank if you do not know the party with which you will be dealing. For example, if you have granted emergency medical powers over your child to a child care worker in case you cannot be reached, you may not know which hospital your proxy will have to deal with."

A few examples of situations that may require an authorization letter include: A parent or guardian may grant child care workers authorization to make basic emergency medical decisions regarding the children in their care. It is advisable to give an authorization letter for minors traveling with adults who are not their parents or guardians. This will protect the minor from child trafficking and child custody issues.

The third party is the person selected to act as a proxy in the first party’s absence. The letter should be addressed to the second party. The letter will explain the rights granted to the proxy who will be acting in your place.
