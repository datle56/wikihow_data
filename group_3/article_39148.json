      "content": "Place the hair tie inside it the rectangle. You will need to scrunch the fabric up in order to get it to wrap around the hair tie. When you are done, the long, raw edges of the rectangle should be outside the hair tie. The folded part should be on the inside. The hair tie should be sandwiched inside the folded rectangle, touching the right sides of the fabric."

You can do this by hand, using very small stitches, or on a sewing machine. Do not stitch the narrow ends together. When you are done, you should have a tube around the hair tie. Again, you may have to scrunch the tube up to get it to fit. Remove the pins when you are done."

When you are done, the seam should be on the inside, and the right side of the fabric should be facing you. Remove the safety pin when you are done."
