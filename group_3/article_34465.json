      "content": "Choose a password that will be hard for hackers to guess. Your Facebook password should be difficult to guess, yet easy for you to remember. [1] X Research source Avoid including your name, birthdate, pets, or common words in your password. The longer the password, the more difficult it will be for others to crack. One way to create a strong password is to think of a long phrase or series of words that you can remember, but that nobody would ever guess. Always include numbers, a mix of upper- and lower-case letters, and symbols in your passwords. Aim for at least 10 characters. Try making an acronym out of a memorable sentence or song lyrics. For example, \"I'm gonna take my horse to the old town road\" could be iGTMhtthotR9! Who would guess that?"

There are many good password managers available that will encrypt and safely store your passwords so you only have to remember one master password. [3] X Expert Source Luigi Oppido Computer & Tech Specialist Expert Interview. 31 July 2019. Some popular options are LastPass, Dashlane , and 1password . You might even have a password manager built into your operating system. For example, if you have a Mac, iPhone, or iPad, you can use the iCloud Keychain for free. If you're using a browser that saves your passwords, such as Google Chrome, you'll be required to enter a master password to see them in plain text. In the case of Chrome, you'll have to enter your Google password. If it's Microsoft Edge and you're using Windows 10, you'll have to confirm your default sign-in password or PIN."

Hackers commonly use keyloggers on computer systems that record everything you type, including passwords. [5] X Research source If you must log in on a computer you don't trust, you can request a one-time password from Facebook in some regions as long as your phone number is already linked to your account. [6] X Research source To do this, send a text message to 32665 (if you're not in the US, see this list for your number) containing the letters otp . As long as your mobile phone is linked to Facebook, you'll receive a 6-digit temporary passcode you can use in the \"Password\" blank to sign in. If it’s not possible for you to use a one-time password and you absolutely must sign in, change your Facebook password as soon as you're back at your own computer, phone, or tablet. Avoid using the “remember password” feature on computers other than your own. If you sign in to Facebook on a public computer (or even at a friend's house), you may see a “remember password” prompt that asks if you'd like to save the password. Choose the Not Now (or similar) option, or else other users of that computer can gain access to your account."
