      "title": "Pay attention to the email address.",
      "content": "Pay attention to the email address. One of the most common techniques of email scammers is to use an email address that appears to be official. After all, if the bank is emailing you, it stands to reason it's a legitimate inquiry. Often these email addresses aren't actually official email addresses, and are only similar to email addresses. For example: [1] X Research source The legitimate domain for Bank of America is @bankofamerica.com. If the domain in your email is @bankofamerica.us, or @ bankofamerica.net or any variation it's probably a fake."

      "content": "Don't fall for any urgent appeals. There are very few \"urgent\" circumstances arising between a bank and its customer. Even if there are urgent circumstances, email is the last method of contact the bank will use. [2] X Research source If an urgent circumstance does arise, you'll either be contacted by telephone, postal mail, or you'll learn about it on the news. Keep an eye out for poor grammar, spelling, and punctuation. Phishing emails often originate from scammers outside of the US, so English isn't the native language of the scammers. Their correspondence is often littered with errors and/or spelled according to British spelling conventions."

      "title": "Remember that personal information is the key to identity theft.",
      "content": "Remember that personal information is the key to identity theft. Scammers are usually out to commit some permutation of identity theft. As such they'll typically ask for some type of personal information in a phishing email. [3] X Research source In particular, they'll ask for Social Security numbers, credit card numbers, the PIN to your debit card or ATM card, or your Bank of America online login information. Bank of America will never ask you for any of the above in an email."

      "title": "Don't delete the email--yet.",
      "content": "Don't delete the email--yet. You'll need to share the email with Bank of America eventually, so keep it in your mailbox until then. Meanwhile, don't click on anything in the suspicious email. Scammers can be very clever, and if they can't get you to give up your personal information directly, they will sometimes embed malware into links given in emails. The malware, which can be very hard to remove, can record personal information such as logins and passwords used to steal your identity."

They will contact you by telephone to let you know whether or not the communication was legitimate. If the communication is fraudulent, they will work with law-enforcement to track down its source.

      "content": "Beware of similar schemes. Less commonly, the same types of scams are run through text message and Voice Over Internet Protocol phones. The same hallmarks, including urgent appeals, poor spelling, and the solicitation of private information, all apply. [6] X Research source You can report these types of suspected fraud exactly the same way. Email abuse@bankofamerica.com or call 1-800-432-1000."

When it comes time to throw them away, shred or otherwise destroy them first. [9] X Research source Better yet, switch to online banking and electronic billing. That way, a record is kept without the accompanying paper trail. In addition, it helps you familiarize yourself with your bank's online protocols, making it less likely you'll be fooled by a phishing email in the future."

      "content": "Keep identifying information separated. Don't write your account number or driver's license number on a personal check, or your PIN on your debit card. By doing so, you make it easy on scammers. If they get a hold of one of these items, they are already in possession of more than one type of important information. Even though it sacrifices convenience, keeping your identifying information separate is more secure. [10] X Research source"
