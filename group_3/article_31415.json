      "content": "Sit strategically. You want to try to sit in the teacher’s blind spot so they hopefully don’t notice you. Where you sit depends on the style of your classroom and your teacher. Try to sit in the edge of the classroom, out of the teacher’s main focus of vision. You can sit in the back to hopefully hide or the very front so the teacher possibly completely looks past you and forgets you are there. [1] X Research source You can try to sit next to someone who answers a lot of questions to hopefully blend in next to them. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Look toward the front of the classroom.",
      "content": "Look toward the front of the classroom. While the teacher is teaching, look toward them. Don’t look out the window, fidget, doodle, or text. At least look like you are paying attention to what they are saying. The teacher might find it disrespectful and think you are not paying attention if you seem distracted. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Have an appropriate balance of eye contact.",
      "content": "Have an appropriate balance of eye contact. When your teacher is scanning the room trying to decide who to call on, do not make direct eye contact with the teacher. However, don’t clearly avoid eye contact and definitely don’t look down. Look away for a second then look back at the teacher then look away again. Try to find a good balance between completely avoiding looking at your teacher and looking at them too much. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Look confident.",
      "content": "Look confident. Even if you aren’t confident and have no idea what the answer to the question is, pretend you do. Sit up straight and don’t look worried or nervous. Don’t look eager to answer the question, but don’t look like you clearly were not paying attention either. The teacher will likely call on someone who either seems overly confident or nervous.

      "content": "Look through your notes. When the teacher is scanning the room, looking for someone to call on, search through your notes. Make it look like you are trying to find the answer and that you remember writing it down. If the teacher sees you searching through your notes, they might not call on you because they know you are trying to find the right answer. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Pretend to write down notes. You should write real notes too, but if you are trying to trick your teacher not to call on you, pretend to write more notes. If the teacher is scanning the room, start writing down notes as if you are writing down a few more points from what the teacher said. The teacher will think you are really concentrating and trying to understand all the points. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Rifle through your bag. When the teacher is deciding who to call on start rifling through your backpack, binder, or pencil case like you are looking for something important. Your teacher will hopefully see that you are focused on needing something urgently and not want to interrupt you. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Make a concentrated face. Look like you are really focused and trying to think of the answer when the teacher is calling on students. If you look like you are concentrating the teacher will assume you were paying attention, but don’t know the answer, so they won’t call on you. You can also try making a really confused face like you don’t understand the question. [9] X Research source"

      "content": "Overcome speaking anxiety. If you want to avoid getting called on in class is because you are nervous to talk in front of other people, you might have a speaking anxiety . You can overcome this by being prepared for class and feeling confident and positive. Start your answers strong and don’t mumble. Practice speaking in front of smaller groups and then work your way up to talking in class. [11] X Research source"

      "title": "Pay attention in class.",
      "content": "Pay attention in class. If you pay attention and concentrate, you will feel a lot more comfortable answering questions in class. When the teacher talks, actively listen and try to process what is being said. Take notes while the teacher talks and sit in the front of the class. Don’t be on your phone during class. It will distract you and stop you from paying attention."

Do any homework assignments before class so you are prepared for any questions that the teacher might ask. If you feel confident, you won’t have to worry about avoiding the teacher and you will have a better experience in class."
