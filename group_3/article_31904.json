      "title": "“Of course.”",
      "content": "“Of course.” This friendly response makes it clear to your friends and family that your help and kindness are guaranteed. By saying “Of course,” you’re telling them that they can expect favors or help from you because you’re happy to support them.

      "content": "“No problem.” Responding to a friend’s, “Thank you” with a cheerful “No problem” or “Not a problem” means that the help you gave them didn’t bother or inconvenience you. This is an especially great response to ease someone’s worry or guilt if they thought they were burdening you with a favor. For an even more casual response, say “No prob” or “No problemo!” [2] X Research source Them : “I can’t thank you enough for picking up Chili from the dog groomers! You are a lifesaver.” You : “No problem! I was already headed that way so it just took me a second to get him.” Note : Older adults can find “No problem” impolite or rude, as it can sound like the help they asked for was a problem for you (even though this phrase means the opposite). So, stick to saying it to your younger friends and family instead of your elders."
    },
    {
      "title": "“No worries” or “Don’t worry about it.”",

    },
    {

[3] X Research source Them : “Wow, I can’t believe you got me such a thoughtful gift! I love it, thank you so much!” You : “Absolutely!

[7] X Research source Them : “I’m so grateful that you could come over early and help me set up for the party. Everyone said it was a blast!” You : “Really, it’s the least I could do!

    },
    {
      "title": "“I’m sure you’d do the same for me.”",

It also communicates that they didn’t ask you to do something inconvenient or bothersome, as they’d be glad to do the same favor for you. Them : “I can’t thank you enough for taking care of me while I was sick. I’m not sure how to pay you back for your kindness.” You : “I know you’d do the same for me. So, don’t worry about it.

[8] X Research source Them : “Thanks so much for watering my plants while I was on vacation! They look just as happy and healthy as when I left.” You : “Hey, just returning the favor! You kept my plants alive when I was gone last month.”"
