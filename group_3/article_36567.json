When you are at the pet store, you may not find a shampoo that is specific to removing a urine smell. Fortunately, a thorough cleaning with a mild, good-quality shampoo will likely be effective in getting the smell out of your pet's skin and fur. Deodorizing shampoos are available that contain baking soda or citrus to neutralize bad odors. [2] X Research source Oatmeal- or aloe vera-containing shampoos are usually a good choice, since they will not dry out your pet's skin. [3] X Research source [4] X Research source If your pet has a skin condition (e.g., allergies, dry skin), your veterinarian can recommend a shampoo that is specific to your his medical needs. Do not use a human shampoo (even baby shampoo). Although human shampoo is not toxic to your pet, it can contain ingredients or fragrances than can irritate his skin. In addition, human shampoo has a pH that could lead to a skin reaction.

[7] X Research source The type of brush you need will depend on the texture of your pet's coat. The staff at your local pet store can help you pick out the type of brush that would work best for your pet. For your cat, a metal comb and a bristle or rubber brush are useful for smoothing her coat and removing dead and loose hair. If your dog has a short and smooth coat, bristle and rubber brushes will loosen and remove dead skin and dirt. If your dog has long hair, slicker and bristle brushes are most useful.

If you are bathing your pet in your tub, you will need to put a towel in the bottom of the tub to create a non-skid surface. [9] X Research source At least one or two more towels (depending on your pet's size) will be needed to dry off your pet after his bath. Super-absorbent towels are available at your local pet store. [10] X Trustworthy Source American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Leading organization dedicated to the prevention of animal cruelty Go to source If you have a cat or very small dog, he's probably small enough to be bathed in your sink. However, since he smells like urine, it is advisable to bathe him in your bathtub instead of your kitchen sink. Pet-specific blow dryers are available at your local pet store if you prefer to dry your pet with a blow dryer. They can be especially useful for long haired pets. Make sure that your pet is comfortable with the noise of a blow dryer before using it to dry him off. [11] X Research source"

[12] X Trustworthy Source American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Leading organization dedicated to the prevention of animal cruelty Go to source In addition to the aforementioned bath supplies, you may also need some cotton balls that you would place in your pet's ears to keep protect them from water. [13] X Trustworthy Source American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Leading organization dedicated to the prevention of animal cruelty Go to source A small washcloth will be needed to clean your pet's face. Pouring or spraying water directly on your pet's face would be a very unpleasant experience for him.

Trimming your pet's nails may keep you from being scratched when you are bathing your pet. [15] X Research source It is important not to get shampoo in your pet's eyes, so you may want to consider purchasing an pet-safe eye ointment. [16] X Research source Ask your veterinarian for recommendations on which ointment to purchase. If you are bathing your pet outside, you may want to purchase a pet-specific tub (available at your local pet store) or kiddie pool to set him in.

[20] X Research source You can pick up your cat, but he may run and hide from you if he knows that you are about to give him a bath. Entice him out of his hiding spot with a treat. Do not be surprised if your pet becomes resistant once he realizes where he is going. If this happens, do not raise your voice. [21] X Research source Be gentle yet firm with him, since bathing him will be necessary to remove the urine smell. Once you get to the bathing area, it may be helpful to give your pet a treat or two.

Keep in mind that shampoo has the tendency to strip the skin and coat of natural oils, so you do not want to shampoo him too many times. Use a washcloth dampened with plain water (no shampoo- bold) to wash your pet's face.

Your veterinarian can perform various diagnostic tests, such as bloodwork and a urinalysis, to determine the cause of your pet smelling like urine. If your cat has arthritis, he may smell like urine because his arthritis prevents him from adequately grooming and cleaning himself. An obese cat would also be unable to groom and clean himself."
