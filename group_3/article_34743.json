      "title": "Insert a pushpin into the valve at the bottom of the lighter.",
      "content": "Insert a pushpin into the valve at the bottom of the lighter. Turn the lighter upside down to reveal a valve with a small metal ball inside of it. This is the lighter valve, which needs to be open to refill the lighter. To do so, push the tip of a pushpin over the metal ball to push it into the lighter, then remove the pin. [1] X Research source When you push the metal ball into the lighter, you’ll be able to hear it moving inside."
    },
    {
      "title": "Make sure the lighter is completely empty.",
      "content": "Make sure the lighter is completely empty. Some fluid may spray out when you remove the pushpin. You want to make sure you empty any excess fluid before refilling the lighter with fresh butane. [2] X Research source When the lighter fluid is completely empty, there won’t be any hissing sound coming from the valve. You can check if there’s fluid by flicking the lighter to see if there’s a flame."

      "title": "Place 3 rubber grommets over the nozzle of the butane.",
      "content": "Place 3 rubber grommets over the nozzle of the butane. Remove the lid of the butane can to reveal a small nozzle on top. Slide 3 rubber grommets over the nozzle so they come just past the tip of the nozzle. This keeps excess butane from spilling out when you refill your lighter. [3] X Research source Rubber grommets are small circular rubber devices with a hole in the middle, shaped sort of like a donut."

    {
      "title": "Shake the butane can and then refill the lighter.",
      "content": "Shake the butane can and then refill the lighter. Hold the lighter upside down (so the valve faces up), then place the nozzle of the butane can into the hole at the bottom of the lighter. Gently push down on the butane container to refill the lighter. [4] X Research source Wait about 5 seconds. That's about how long it takes the lighter to fill. The rubber will muffle the sound so you may not be able to tell that the lighter is being filled, but it is."

    {
      "title": "Remove the butane can and immediately cover the valve with your thumb.",
      "content": "Remove the butane can and immediately cover the valve with your thumb. Once you've filled the lighter, remove the butane can to keep it from overflowing. The fluid will spray out if you don't cover the hole, so place your thumb over the hole as soon as you remove the nozzle. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Insert the pushpin back into the hole in the valve.",
      "content": "Insert the pushpin back into the hole in the valve. Do this as fast as you can to prevent butane from spilling out. This will remain in the valve to seal it. You will be unable to reuse the factory valve, so you'll have to use a pushpin to seal it. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Cut off the top of the pushpin with a metal snipper (optional). Since it looks a little strange to have a pushpin sticking out of the bottom of your lighter, you can use metal snippers to remove the top of the pushpin. Just wrap the snippers over the base of the pushpin and cut. Finish by smoothing the edges of the cut area with a metal file. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Pull the lighter out of the metal case. Open the case of your zippo lighter, and grab both sides of the flint wheel (the grooved circle that you turn with your thumb to create a flame) with your thumb and index finger. Hold the bottom of the lighter with your other hand and pull the metal part up to remove the lighter from its case. [8] X Research source It should come out easily, but if it’s a newer lighter, you may have to pull a bit harder to get it out."

Use your fingers to lift this pad and expose the inside of the lighter. If you can't lift it with your fingers, try using a pushpin or flathead for help. [9] X Research source"

      "content": "Squirt Zippo Premium fluid into the lighter. Insert the nozzle of the lighter fluid into the compartment just under the lever. Squirt some fluid into the lighter until the padding on the inside is dark and damp. You may want to squeeze the fluid for 3 to 5 second increments and wait 10 seconds for it to soak in. [10] X Research source If you don’t have Zippo Premium lighter fluid, you can use any lighter fluid you like. Just make sure to transfer it to a smaller squirt bottle so you control how much fluid you add to the lighter."

Once you're done refilling the lighter, put the felt “Lift to Fill” pad back in its place and reinsert the lighter into its case. It should now be ready for use. [11] X Research source Warning: Never light your Zippo lighter when it's out of its case—lighter fluid may have leaked during the refilling process and you could end up burning your hand or causing an explosion."

Push the tip of a screwdriver (or pushpin) into the hole and press down until you don’t hear any noise. This means all the butane has escaped and you can begin refilling the lighter.

Fill the lighter with butane for about 3-4 seconds, then check the butane level window to see if it’s filled with liquid. [13] X Research source"

As you wait, check the lighter for leaks and wipe up leaked fuel with a paper towel.
