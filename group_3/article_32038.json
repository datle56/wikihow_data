      "title": "Tuck one cup into the other.",
      "content": "Tuck one cup into the other. Fold each bra in half, inverting one cup so that it collapses into the other. The cups of non-molded bras are not easily distorted, so you should be able to invert them without causing any damage to the integrity of the cup shape or the overall bra. [2] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Stack the bras.",
      "content": "Stack the bras. Fold each bra separately, then stack them together. Stack one on top of another so that the cups of one bra rest over the cups of the one beneath it. For sports bras, simply fold them in half and stack them on top of each other."

      "title": "Keep the bras in a protected space.",
      "content": "Keep the bras in a protected space. If possible, place the bras in a separate zipper compartment of your suitcase instead of keeping them in the main space with the rest of your clothes. Another option would be to slide the stacked bras into a large Ziploc bag. [3] X Expert Source Archana Ramamoorthy, MS Tech Executive Expert Interview. 26 February 2019. Leave some air in the bag to protect the bras from getting crushed by other items in your suitcase.

      "content": "Unpack the bras when you reach your destination. Remove the bras from your suitcase and keep them out for the remainder of your stay. Leaving any bra in a stuffed suitcase for a prolonged period can cause damage to the underwire and the overall integrity of the bra. You can hang your unpacked bras on a hook, hanger, or doorknob. You could also lay them in a drawer."

      "title": "Save the bras for last.",
      "content": "Save the bras for last. Your bras should be one of the last things you pack so that the weight of your other items don’t compress them. Clear a space for them within the top layer of clothes in your suitcase. [6] X Research source If you try to cram the bras into a space that is too small, you may distort the cups."

    {
      "title": "Stack the bras on top of each other.",
      "content": "Stack the bras on top of each other. Place your bras together so that the cups of each one rest on top of the cups of the bra beneath it. All of the bras should lie flat, not folded. Do not fold one cup into another when you are packing molded bras. By inverting one cup, you distort the shape of that cup. This can lead to dents, bumps, and an overall improper fit."

      "title": "Stuff the cups so they keep their shape.",
      "content": "Stuff the cups so they keep their shape. Roll up your socks, tank tops, or underwear and stuff the material into the cups of the bottom bra. Fill the cups of the bra with enough material to keep them as full as possible. Doing so will preserve their shape and prevent the cups from caving inward even when accidental pressure is applied.

      "content": "Tuck in the straps to prevent the hooks from getting snagged. Stuff the straps beneath the cup of the bra they belong to and above the cup of the bra beneath. For the bottom bra, stuff the strap in between the cups of the bra and the stuffing material you filled them with."

      "content": "Protect the bras from items that could damage them. Place the stacked bras in a large Ziploc bag, and leave some air in the bag to cushion the bras. This prevents the bras from being snagged on other items and helps preserve their shape. Do not place anything heavy on top of the bras, and keep them away from anything that may crush the cups.

      "content": "Remove the bras from your suitcase as soon as possible. Ideally, you should unpack your bras as soon as you reach your destination. Do not leave them in your suitcase once arriving where you plan to stay, or the cups may become distorted. Lay your bras in a drawer, or hang them up for the duration of your trip."

      "title": "Choose a hard case.",
      "content": "Choose a hard case. You can choose an ordinary box or a specialized bra traveling case, but either way, the container you use should be rigid. Options include a sturdy plastic container or cardboard box. The container should span the length of your bra cups when they lie flat, and the width of the container should roughly match the height of the cups. [9] X Research source There are several cases available on the market that are specially designed to hold bras, but the best are bra-shaped, hardcover, and designed so that the bras will lie flat instead of folded."

      "title": "Stack the bras inside the case and tuck in the straps.",
      "content": "Stack the bras inside the case and tuck in the straps. Lay the bras out flat and stack them on top of one another. The cups of one bra should fit over the cups of the one beneath it. Tuck the straps in to prevent the hooks from snagging on other bras. The straps of each bra should be wedged in between the cups of the bra they belong to and the cups of the bra beneath it. Take care not to overstuff the case! When packing bras with molded cups, you should never fold one cup into another. Doing so will cause dents, bumps, and other distortions in the cup you invert, and as a result, the bra will no longer fit as well as it should."

      "content": "Place the case inside of your empty suitcase. Before packing the rest of your items, place the packed case inside of the main body of your empty suitcase. Pack the rest of your clothes around the case, and fill in as much space around the sides of the case as possible. Doing so can prevent the bras from getting tossed around and tangled during transport. [10] X Research source Note that you can unpack your bras when you reach your destination or you can keep them in the case for the duration of your trip."

      "content": "Select bras based on the activities and events you have planned. You’ll need different styles of bras based on what kind of trip you are taking. For active outings and exercising choose a sports bra. Pick a t-shirt or standard bra, with or without underwire, for everyday activities. If you plan to attend fancy events, choose a strapless or convertible bra to be sure it doesn’t show beneath your formal wear. [11] X Research source"

[12] X Expert Source Archana Ramamoorthy, MS Tech Executive Expert Interview. 26 February 2019. For most purposes, a standard smooth bra in a nude color or skin tone will be your best option. For black tops and other dark shades, consider packing a dark-colored bra to avoid any of the dye rubbing off onto a light-colored bra. [13] X Research source"

      "content": "Pack enough bras to last through your trip. Figure out how many days you'll be gone and determine how many days you can wear each bra you’ve selected. Make sure that you have enough to rotate through during your trip. Always pack more than one bra, even if you're only going to stay somewhere for a couple of days, in case an unforeseen mishap occurs, like the snapping of a strap. [14] X Research source As a general rule, you should plan on wearing one bra for every two to three days of your trip. If you plan to do laundry while you're away, make sure that you have enough bras to last you through your intended laundry day, plus one extra in case your laundry day is delayed."
