      "content": "Wear proper protection. At bare minimum, you should wear shatter proof glasses or goggles when machine-sharpening skates. Ear and breathing protection are also recommended. Do not wear loose clothing or accessories that can be caught in the grinding wheel. Tie back long hair and consider a protective hair covering."

      "content": "Turn on the machine. Make sure that your work area is free from clutter. Before powering the machine, double-check that nothing is in contact with the grinding wheel, including the diamond dresser. Make sure the grinding wheel is balanced before you begin. Some machines require that the diamond dresser be in position, touching the wheel, before the machine is turned on. Read your machine's operating manual to determine if this applies.

      "title": "Figure out the radius size you need.",
      "content": "Figure out the radius size you need. The default that most skate shops use is a 1/2\" radius, which is standard for young skaters. A smaller radius will create a deeper hollow, creating better grip and more drag. A larger radius, on the other hand, will produce a shallow hollow with worse grip and less drag. Grip determines maneuverability, while less drag allows for greater speed. The \"radius\" refers to the shape the grinding wheel takes out of skate that's brushed against it. You may remember from geometry class that the radius of a circle is half its width. Think of a circle with a small radius and how that can cut into the end of a rectangle. It can overlap much more than a circle with a larger radius. Thus, smaller radii create much more dramatic edges (a deeper hollow) than the more blunt edges of larger radii (a shallow hollow). [2] X Research source Typical starting radii include: 3/8\" for very light skaters, 5/8\" for average skaters, 3/4\" for heavy skaters, and 7/8\" â€“ 1 1/4\" for hockey goalies. Start with these guidelines but tailor your radius to what ends up working best for you. For increased glide, select a radius of 1\" or higher. For better grip and control, pick one that is 3/8\" or smaller."

      "content": "Adjust the diamond dresser. Change the dresser's position within the dresser arm to achieve the appropriate radius size. In general, you will loosen the diamond's arm grip with a thumbscrew and move the dresser backwards or forwards. The diamond dresser will be marked with lines according to radius size."

      "content": "Dress the grinding wheel. Press the diamond dresser into the moving grinding wheel for a few seconds. In general, the dresser will be attached to a tool that you will move up and down across the wheel. The exact method for dressing your wheel, and for machine-sharpening in general, will vary depending on the model you're using. Always consult your machine's user guide and documentation for details."

      "content": "Gather your materials. You will need a sharpening jig, a large 2-sided sharpening stone, a small burr stone, and a rag to wipe everything down. Look for a jig and stones specifically meant for sharpening skates. These are often sold together as a sharpening set. You will also need something to lubricate your stone, which will depend on the particular type you use. This will usually be water, some type of oil, or a mixture thereof. If you are a speed skater, you probably want skates that are completely flat, creating a perfect 90 degree angle with the ice."

      "title": "Lubricate your stones.",
      "content": "Lubricate your stones. Simply wet your stones with a few drops of the correct lubricant. The lubricant will help to whisk away debris as you sharpen. If you are using a set of traditional oil-lubricated stones for the first time, you will need to saturate them with oil before their first use. In a plastic container, pour or brush some oil onto one side of the stone. Wait for the stone to absorb the oil before adding some more. Once the oil absorption slows, flip the stone over and repeat the process on the opposite side. Wrap the stones in plastic between sharpenings. This will prevent your stones from becoming clogged with dirty oil. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Mount your skate in the sharpening jig.",
      "content": "Mount your skate in the sharpening jig. Speed skate sharpening jigs generally hold two skates parallel to each other with clamps. The heel and toe ends of each skate will have their own clamps for a total of four. Different jigs will have different specific instructions. Consult the user manual that came with yours if you aren't sure how to secure your skates properly. Orient your skates parallel with the blades in the air, as if you were skating upside-down. The toe end of a jig usually has a guide-plate. Make sure the end of each blade is up against this plate before you finish tightening the clamps. The exact orientation of your blades isn't as important as maintaining consistency between the right and left sides and across multiple sharpenings. For example, some people place the heel-ends of their blades up against the guide-plate instead of the toe-ends. As long as this is done every time the blades are sharpened, this is a perfectly valid way of mounting a skate."

Sometimes you will find burrs before you begin to sharpen. If that's the case, remove them with your burr stone. Position your burr stone flat against the side of the blade with the top of the stone placed slightly past the top of the blade. Apply steady, even pressure to push your burr stone along the entire length of the blade in one motion. Repeat these strokes until the burr is removed. [5] X Research source"

When four distinct burrs have formed, one on either side of each blade, you have finished the grinding process. Keep in mind that a partially-sharpened blade will develop a burr on the outside edge before it does so on the inside. How many total sets you will need to do will depend on how dull the blade was when you began. A blade that has been recently sharpened may only need a few sets of 2x20, while a very dull skate may need a few dozen. [10] X Research source"
