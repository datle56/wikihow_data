      "content": "If you’re overwhelmed, take a methodical approach. Bring home three big boxes from your grocery store. Label each box using a permanent marker: one \"Keep\", one \"Sell\", and one \"Charity\". Also get a large, lined garbage can into which you can toss things that you don't want to keep, sell, or donate. Using an organized approach will help you break down the task. [1] X Research source In each room make a pile of items on the floor. Pick up an item, decide which box to put it into, and toss it into the box. Repeat the process until all the items in the pile are sorted. Feel free to move the items around between boxes or swap them out after you’ve had a chance to think."

      "content": "Tackle just one room. Each room or area of a house can present its own level of decluttering difficulties. If you’re not sure where to start, try cleaning up a lesser-used area (like a formal dining room). Spaces that are less frequently used will likely be easier to declutter and can therefore bring a quick reward to keep you motivated. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Set a time limit for the decluttering session. Give yourself 15 minutes to one hour, set a timer, and don't start more than you can finish in your allotted time. When the timer rings, make yourself stop, clean up, and then take at least a 15-minute break so you don't burn out. You can always decide to do another round after the break is over.

      "content": "First, shift your mindset to prioritize yourself over your stuff. To declutter quickly and efficiently, you’ll need to recognize that your time and happiness are more important than every item you’re evaluating. Set up a sticky note or a sign to remind yourself that you are more than your stuff. Oftentimes, in de-cluttering, it’s the emotions surrounding objects that prevent you from getting rid of items.

      "content": "Use a strict rule to get rid of items. Decide to get rid of any item that doesn’t make you enthusiastically say, “Yes! I want to keep that!” By using strong criteria, you’ll be able to make decisions faster instead of staying in the “maybe” zone. If the item isn’t a solid “yes!” then throw it into the “Donate,” “Sell,” or “Trash” pile. You can decide which pile to use based on the item’s value, signs of wear, and potential usefulness to someone else. [5] X Research source"

Acrylic storage bins work well for toiletries while you can use large plastic containers to store off-season clothes and open-top storage cubes to store small items of clothing. Sort your items by use (i.e. desk supplies, socks, hiking gear) and place items you use frequently where they’re easier to access. [8] X Research source"

You can also determine whether to store items based on the season. For example, during the winter months you may not entertain as often. If so, you can place your serving trays and extra dishes in the basement until spring or summer comes. You can do the same for seasonal items like BBQ accessories (skewers, grills, etc.). Putting away items temporarily can also help you decide if the item is something you really use or not! [10] X Research source"

Be sure not to confuse “usefulness” of an item with real use. For instance, if you have a fancy kitchen mixer, but you never bake, that’s a “useful” item, but you’re not actually using it! It may be time to let that item go. Before you let something go, make sure to ask yourself whether you need the item. For instance, medical documents might not be useful to you on a day-to-day basis, and you might not care much about them, but you do need them in case of an emergency! [12] X Research source As you’re deciding whether or not to keep an item, ask yourself these three things, “Do I use it? Do I love it? Do I need it?” [13] X Research source If you feel guilty about getting rid of an item, don’t beat yourself up. For expensive items or bad purchases, remember you’re paying for the item with the space it’s taking up (if the item isn’t adding value to your life). For sentimental items, recognize that your feelings around the item are not part of the physical object itself. You can hold onto great memories of past trips and experiences without the memorabilia.
