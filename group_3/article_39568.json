      "content": "The 😮‍💨 (sigh) emoji means someone’s feeling exhausted. Someone who’s had a particularly hectic day or is feeling super overwhelmed by all the work or studying they have to do might send you this sighing emoji. You can practically feel their weariness being conveyed through this big, digital exhale. [1] X Research source “Work was so crazy today. I just want to lay down 😮‍💨” “I just got done with my test and literally feel like passing out 😮‍💨😴” “😮‍💨😭 I need a vacation.”"

      "content": "😮‍💨 can imply that someone’s disappointed or upset. Haven’t you ever felt the urge to just let out a deep sigh when things don’t go as planned? That might be exactly what your friend is trying to convey to you over text by sending 😮‍💨. [2] X Research source “I can’t believe I didn’t pass this test 😮‍💨 I studied so hard! 😤” “I didn’t get the concert tickets 😮‍💨” “😮‍💨 I didn’t win the contest. Guess I’ll try again next time 🤷”"

      "title": "😮‍💨 means that someone is feeling anxious or nervous.",
      "content": "😮‍💨 means that someone is feeling anxious or nervous. When your friend or family member sends you 😮‍💨, it might mean that they have something big coming up and are feeling a bit nervous. In this case, 😮‍💨 looks more like someone letting out a nervous exhale and trying to calm down. [3] X Research source “My presentation is literally in 10 minutes 😮‍💨 Wish me luck 😭” “My boss just said she wants to ‘talk’ to me. Cool, I’m totally not nervous at all haha 😮‍💨😅” “Test results come out today. I’m trying so hard not to freak out right now 😮‍💨”"

      "content": "Sending 😮‍💨 can convey relief. This emoji is a visual representation of what it feels like to finally be able to breathe after going through something stressful or nerve-wracking. Maybe your friend just got out of a job interview, or maybe they finally finished a huge project they were working on. Either case would be the perfect time to send 😮‍💨. [4] X Research source “It took me a collective 20 hours, but I finally finished this essay 😮‍💨” “Turns out my cough was just from allergies and I’m not actually sick 😮‍💨” “Just found out that my appointment is actually at 3, so I can still make it to your party! 😮‍💨🎉”"

      "content": "A person might be telling you they’re bored by sending 😮‍💨. In this case, the sigh this little emoji is letting out is one of boredom. Maybe they’re stuck in a super boring meeting, or maybe they’re sitting at home with nothing to do. Sending the sighing emoji might be their subtle plea for you to entertain them. [5] X Research source “This class is so boring 😮‍💨 I haven’t been listening for the last 30 minutes.” “It’s Friday night and I’m literally sitting at home 😮‍💨 Wanna hang out?” “My friend is making me watch a documentary about snails 😮‍💨🙄 Save me.”"

When you look at it, the 😮‍💨 emoji also looks like a person trying to catch their breath after running around or doing some other physical activity. If someone sent you 😮‍💨, it could mean that they’re texting you while they’re still out of breath. “I know I’m late, but just know that I’m literally running to get there 😮‍💨😮‍💨🏃” “Just got back from the gym 😮‍💨🏋️” “I didn’t realize that bike riding was so tiring 😮‍💨😮‍💨”"

It could also be interpreted as someone exhaling when the weather is so cold that it makes their breath visible. [6] X Research source “I’m going out for a smoke break 😮‍💨🚬” “It’s so cold today I can literally see my breath 😮‍💨🥶”"
