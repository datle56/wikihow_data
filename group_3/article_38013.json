      "content": "Opt to go on a whale watching tour instead of a marine attraction. If you’d like to spend some time around blue whales, sign up for a whale watching tour, which allows you to see the mammals in their native environment. During the tour, ask the guide questions about the biggest threats to the whales in the area. [2] X Research source Many coastal cities like San Francisco, Maui, Boston, and Newport have whale watching tours. If you live near the ocean, check online to see what kinds of whale watching programs are operating near you."

      "content": "Adopt a whale on a charity site to show your support. Search on the websites of large organizations for blue whale “adoption” opportunities. While you won’t be owning or caring for a physical whale, your gesture will directly serve conservation and protection efforts for blue whales. With some organizations, you can purchase different adoption “tiers,” which give you photos, informational cards, and other rewards for your support. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Participate in beach clean-ups to reduce pollution in the ocean. If you live near the coastline, look online for local clean-up events happening in your area. When necessary, register online for the project so you can participate. If there are no beach clean-up projects happening, try organizing one yourself! [4] X Research source When you get rid of litter, you help make the ocean a safer and healthier place for Blue Whales. Blue whale adoptions can also be done virtually, and given to friends and family members as gifts."

      "content": "Give money to a whale sanctuary project. If you live in a coastal region, search online for information on any whale sanctuaries being constructed near you. Regardless of your location, use an online donation option to give money to the development and construction of future buildings. Since these projects cost millions of dollars to complete, any amount can help! [5] X Research source Sanctuaries provide blue whales with a safe place to live and reproduce without any threats from shipping and pollution."

      "content": "Sign online petitions that advocate for the blue whales’ protection. Search on different advocacy sites for petitions related to the safety and wellbeing of blue whales. Additionally, check government-sponsored websites for petitions; depending on the website, the petition might be viewed by the government if it gets enough signatures. Before signing anything, check that the digital document has a clear message with a tangible action plan. [6] X Research source For instance, a petition that only says “Save the whales!” wouldn’t be very helpful or productive in the long run. Instead, look for a petition that says something like: “We want to push for legislation that reduces pollution by…”"

      "content": "Boycott large companies that participate in the whaling industry. Research if the grocery stores, distributors, and brands in your region work with any whaling companies. Even if the companies aren’t actively participating in whaling, make an effort to avoid their products and business until the company’s leadership makes a change in their policy. If you choose to boycott a company, suggest to your friends, family members, and acquaintances that they do the same. [7] X Trustworthy Source National Resources Defence Council Multinational environmental advocacy group focused on grassroots activism and legislative action Go to source Be on the lookout for companies that do business with known whaling affiliates, like HB Grandi. On the other hand, look for businesses and brands that actively speak out against whaling, and direct your patronage there."

      "content": "Contact a local representative in your government to make your opinion heard. Search on the national website of your government to find the contact information for both local and federal officials. When writing a letter for the first time, focus on a mayor, state legislator, or county executive. Speak clearly and directly in your letter, so the public official knows why and how they can support your request. [8] X Trustworthy Source USA.GOV Official website for the United States federal government Go to source For instance, try writing something like this: Dear Mr. Johnson, I am contacting you to remind you about an upcoming vote for pollution control. This legislation is extremely important to saving the blue whale species, which is currently endangered. When addressing a letter to an official, be sure to use their full title in the return address (e.g., The Honorable Steve Grant)."

Using the email or address provided, draft a short, concise message to the official, stating your intention and disagreement with the whaling practice. If you can’t find the contact information for a specific ambassador, ask the consulate if they can provide you with what you need. [9] X Research source For example, try writing something like this: Dear Mr./Madam Ambassador, I am writing to you today to discuss your country’s participation in the whaling industry. With this in mind, I’d like to bring to your attention that hunting the blue whale, in addition to other marine mammals, is an issue of international concern."

Although you might not think it’s a big deal, litter is a huge contributing factor to ocean pollution, which has a negative impact on blue whales. [13] X Research source Be especially careful when disposing of items like fishing lines, fish hooks, and plastic six-pac rings. If these items wash into the ocean, marine life can get tangled in them. [14] X Research source"

Look on your town or city’s website to find the best way to throw out toxic materials, like batteries, chemicals, and old medication. Avoid pouring or dumping any toxic materials down the drain or in an open area, as these substances can pollute the surrounding waterways, including the ocean. Depending on your area, you might be able to toss out your hazardous waste at a special location. [15] X Trustworthy Source United States Environmental Protection Agency Independent U.S. government agency responsible for promoting safe environmental practices Go to source Don’t keep your toxic waste in food containers. Although it might seem practical, don’t combine different types of waste into one bottle or container. This could cause the chemicals to ignite or cause a bad chemical reaction."

      "content": "Check your vehicle for leaks to prevent unwanted runoff into the ocean. After driving your vehicle, check around and beneath the car or truck for any signs of leaking. If notice any oil dripping from your car, take the vehicle to an appropriate mechanic immediately. If you see any vehicle oil pooling in your garage or driveway, pour an absorbent substance like sand or cat litter over the spill. Once the sand or litter hardens with the oil, sweep up and dispose of the remains. [16] X Research source After a rainstorm, this oil run-off will flow into storm drains, which eventually lead to major water sources. When lots of unhealthy substances eventually drain into the ocean, it creates an unhealthy environment for whales. Follow your city’s protocols whenever you dispose of used motor oil and other caustic materials. Some places will recycle old car oil free of charge."

      "content": "Avoid using excess pesticides and fertilizers to prevent toxic run-off in the ocean. While lawn and gardening additives can be helpful in a pinch, you don’t want to saturate your yard with them. Always follow the bag or bottle’s instructions when applying fertilizer and pesticides, so you don’t apply too much product to a single area. If you notice any extra fertilizer in the street, use a broom to sweep it up and return it to the original bag. [17] X Research source After a rainfall, these substances wash away into storm drains, which lead into larger water sources. When lots of these chemicals wash into the ocean, it creates an unhealthy environment for blue whales. Some farms use special, environmentally-friendly method known as integrated pest management (IPM) to get rid of bugs and pests carefully.

If you don't need the product in your daily life, then you probably don’t need to purchase it. When you’re buying necessary items, like groceries and toiletries, use reusable shopping totes instead of plastic bags. [19] X Research source Try not to buy food items that are wrapped in plastic wrap. While a piece of wrap may seem small, it can contribute to a much larger pile of waste and ocean pollution once it’s thrown out. Cigarette butts are a huge source of beach pollution."
