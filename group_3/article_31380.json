Tampons provide more freedom in motion and are sometimes better when playing sports, especially those involving water. However, tampons can require some effort with handling or insertion. [1] X Expert Source Rebecca Levy-Gantt, MPT, DO Board Certified Obstetrician & Gynecologist Expert Interview. 3 April 2020. Sanitary pads are worn within your underwear and catch the blood flow. They come in a variety of sizes from slim liners, designed for short term use, to overnight styles. Many women find pads to be bulky and cumbersome; however, they are easy to use and a safe option if you are concerned about forgetting to switch out tampons regularly. A menstrual cup is a flexible, small rubber cup that fits inside your vaginal canal. You insert it by hand and it then collects the blood. You have to remove it at intervals in order to rinse out the collected blood before repeating the process. People who are worried about a tampon's materials may be more comfortable with this option. However, you do have to learn how to properly remove and insert the cup."

The applicator is the harder plastic cover that includes a barrel covering the absorbent interior, a grip area for your fingers to hold onto, and a plunger to help push the tampon inside of you. Go ahead and turn a tampon over in your hand and take a close look. If you are worried about the string for removal, go ahead and give it a tug or two. You will see that it is very snug and not likely to break off. If it makes you more comfortable, you can plan on testing the string of each tampon before using it. Also, get into the habit of taking a good look at the outside packaging. Never use a tampon that comes from a ripped or torn package."

You can also buy just tampons without the applicators. These will require that you use your finger to insert the tampon.

Go to a private place, such as the bathroom, sit on the toilet and use a hand mirror to examine your vulva, also known as your outside genitalia. Don’t be afraid; you really can’t hurt yourself. You will notice that your vaginal opening is the middle area and a smaller hole, your urethra (for urination) is in the area as well, but is smaller. You will insert the tampon within your vaginal opening. Getting to know your body will make you feel more confident about using a tampon properly. [4] X Research source Make sure to always wash your hands before and after touching your vagina. This will ensure that you do not pass germs along. It may appear as if your vaginal opening is not large enough to accommodate a tampon, but this is generally not the case. With a bit of lubrication, often period blood, this opening will stretch wide enough. If you do a bit of research online regarding female anatomy, you will see that it is also not possible to lose your virginity by using a tampon. It is unlikely that a tampon will tear your hymen (the tissue that covers your vaginal opening deep in the interior). And, the loss of virginity requires sexual intercourse. Additionally, virginity is a social construct, so there's no need to worry about it if you don't want to."

There are many reputable websites, including The Period Blog, which provide step-by-step images showing how to insert and remove a tampon. Some sites will even let you ask a question in the comments area, to be later answered by the moderator. It is also a good idea to read the instruction sheet that came with your package of tampons. This sheet often shows a usage diagram, as well and lists safety information as well. Studying your anatomy and usage charts will also show you that your vagina is essentially a canal with the cervix as its end point. This means that it is not possible to permanently “lose” a tampon within you. This is a myth."

If the area is sufficiently lubricated, the tampon applicator should slide smoothly in. You should not have to push it hard or jab it at all. This is the step that presents the most problems for first-time users. If you need to, take a few deep breaths and pause before moving the applicator in."
