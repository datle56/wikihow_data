      "content": "Know the symptoms. Whenever the air pressure around you changes, such as when you're flying in an airplane, climbing to or descending from a high altitude, or diving underwater, the pressure in the cavity inside your ear is supposed to change with it. When the pressure change is quite sudden, however, the pressure inside the ear doesn't always catch up right away. [1] X Expert Source Payam Daneshrad, MD Board Certified Otolaryngologist Expert Interview. 30 September 2020. This difference in pressure between the ear cavity and the outside environment, called barotrauma, leads to uncomfortable and even painful symptoms, like the following: Pain or discomfort in the ear A feeling of fullness or pressure in the ear Ringing in the ear (tinnitus) A change in hearing, almost as if you are submerged in water and sounds are muffled In severe cases, hearing loss, bleeding and vomiting"

      "title": "Yawn and swallow.",
      "content": "Yawn and swallow. To prevent your ear from popping uncomfortably or painfully, you need to stop the difference in pressure from building up. You can do this by yawning and swallowing, actions that open the Eustachian tubes in your ears, allowing the pressure in your ear to sync up with the pressure in your environment. You can also help yourself swallow by chewing gum, sucking on candy, or nursing a drink, all of which will keep you swallowing."

      "title": "Exert counter pressure.",
      "content": "Exert counter pressure. You can do this by performing a simple exercise: close your mouth, pinch your nose, and blow gently. The air has no where to go, so it presses on your Eustachian tubes, which relieves pressure. Do not blow too hard when you attempt this. If you blow too hard, the maneuver is quite painful, and has the potential to actually damage your ear drums. Blow just hard enough to gently pop your ears. Repeat the maneuver several times, especially during takeoff or descent while traveling by plane."

      "title": "Use filtered earplugs.",
      "content": "Use filtered earplugs. These earplugs are specially designed to gradually equalize the pressure as you gain elevation or descend, so that pressure does not build up in your ears. Filtered earplugs are available at drugstores and in airport shops.

      "title": "Treat congestion before you gain altitude.",
      "content": "Treat congestion before you gain altitude. Barotrauma happens more often when you have a head cold, sinus infection or any type of congestion. That's because the Eustachian tube doesn't always open properly when it's inflamed due to allergies or a cold. If you're feeling stuffy before changing altitudes or diving, use a nasal decongestant or antihistamine in preparation. Take a decongestant, such as Sudafed, every six hours and continue for 24 hours after you land to shrink membranes in the sinus and ear. Follow the precautions on the label. [3] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source You can use a pediatric-strength nasal spray as directed on the packaging. The child-strength formula will help open your Eustachian tubes without giving you a stronger dose of medication than you need. Do not take decongestants before or during diving. The body metabolizes decongestants differently while underwater, so taking them before diving is considered risky. If your congestion is quite bad, you might want to reconsider your travel or diving plans and reschedule for when you're feeling better, especially if you've had severe barotrauma in the past.

      "title": "Keep your child awake.",
      "content": "Keep your child awake. While you might be tempted to lull your child to sleep before airplane ascent or descent, if she is awake you can help her prevent barotrauma from happening. Keep her occupied so she doesn't end up falling asleep right when the cabin pressure changes. Try people watching, or read a book together. Be sure that you prepare a young child for the loud sounds and bumpy process of takeoff and landing, so that she does not become frightened. While you can't warn a young baby, you can try other methods of comfort, smiling and saying soothing words to let her know everything is alright."

      "title": "Encourage your child to swallow.",
      "content": "Encourage your child to swallow. Giving your toddler, baby or child something to suck on is a good way to encourage swallowing. Have him swallow throughout the ascent and descent, or if he seems to be complaining that his ears are bothering him. Nursing works great for young babies if you breastfeed. If not, try a pacifier or bottle. An older kid can drink through a sippy cup or a straw, or suck on a lollipop. The key is to get him to actively suck and swallow, so if he is old enough, teach him how to consciously do this in advance so that you can prompt him when it is time."

      "title": "Fake yawn to encourage yawning.",
      "content": "Fake yawn to encourage yawning. While no one really knows why, yawning is socially contagious, so if your child sees you fake a yawn, she is likely to actually yawn in response. Yawning opens the Eustachian tubes in your child's ears, so that the pressure that has built up will equalize with the rest of the cabin."

[5] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Young children generally should not be given decongestants, so if your child has a stuffy nose or sinus infection, it might be a good idea to reschedule your flight to avoid severe barotrauma. Plus, you can avoid exposing other passengers to the illness. If your child has flown before and did not exhibit signs of extreme discomfort, its not necessary to reschedule your flight."

      "title": "Wait for equilibrium to be restored.",
      "content": "Wait for equilibrium to be restored. If your ears pop on a plane or while diving, the problem will usually right itself when you're back on land. Even if the pressure doesn't equalize right away, after an hour or two your ears should feel normal again. In the meantime, yawning and swallowing can help you feel better faster. Some people take a few days for pressure to equalize in their ears, during which time hearing can be muffled, although this is rather rare."

[7] X Expert Source Payam Daneshrad, MD Board Certified Otolaryngologist Expert Interview. 30 September 2020. Severe barotrauma is rare, but can cause permanent ear damage and bring about hearing loss. In very severe cases, barotrauma can cause the inner ear to rupture. This injury usually heals on its own, but you should see a doctor just in case there's another problem complicating the injury. If you experience any of the following symptoms that might indicate your inner ear has ruptured, get medical attention immediately: [8] X Research source Discomfort or pain that persists for several hours Severe pain Bleeding from the ears Hearing loss that doesn't go away"

An incision is made in the eardrum to allow pressure and fluid to drain. [9] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source If you experience severe pain that doesn't go away, see a doctor to determine whether surgery may be necessary. In the meantime, do not fly, dive, or perform any other activity that requires you to gain or lose significant altitude. If your ears pop again further injury could occur."
