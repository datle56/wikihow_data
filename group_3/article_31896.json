      "title": "Break a leg!",
      "content": "Break a leg! While it sounds like the opposite of good luck, this idiom is a form of well-wishing to performers. It has its origins in the theater, where superstition held that saying “good luck” to a performer would bring them bad luck. Now, “Break a leg!” is a common expression to tell any performer. [1] X Research source For example, say, “I can’t wait to see the show. Break a leg!” It’s best to avoid using this expression when talking to an athlete since the risk of injury is greater. Instead, say it to friends or family before a theatrical, comedic, or other performance."

      "title": "Go get ‘em!",
      "content": "Go get ‘em! Use this expression to let a friend or family member know you believe in them. Rather than emphasizing the chance element of the situation by saying, “Good luck,” you’re firing them up to give it their best. Use this idiom before your athlete friend’s big game or a family member’s job interview. For example, tell someone, “It’s your time to shine. Go get ‘em!” This phrase supposedly stems from the longer chant, “Go get ‘em, tiger.” This saying originated at a 1968 Detroit Tigers baseball game. [2] X Research source Keep the “tiger” or drop it for a more general well-wish."

      "content": "“Good Luck, Babe!” If you want to wish a pop music fan good luck, reference the song of the same name by Chappell Roan.

      "content": "You’re in my thoughts and prayers. Instead of telling someone “Good luck!” in a serious situation, let them know you’re thinking about them another way. If they’re religious, you can mention that they’re in your prayers. Otherwise, stick to a saying like “I’m keeping you in my thoughts.” This phrase is best for when someone is going through a crisis, such as awaiting medical results, facing a surgery, or has to go to court.
