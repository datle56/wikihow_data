      "content": "Level—or at least flatten—the ground along the intended fence line. The pallets rest on the ground with this quicker and less permanent DIY method, so use a shovel to remove any vegetation and smooth out the ground where the fence will sit. You can build this kind of fence on ground that has a gentle, even slope, but you’re better off installing permanent fence posts with concrete if you want to build a pallet fence on steeper or uneven ground.

      "content": "Mark the perimeter of your fence with a string line and stakes. Pound wooden stakes in the ground on the outer edge of all ends and corners of your fence line, as well as about every 10 ft (3.0 m) or so in between. Run a string between the stakes, wrapping it around each stake so that it’s toward the inside (fence side) of the stake. [2] X Research source You can skip this step if you want, but you’ll be surprised by how easy it is to end up building a leaning or wavy fence without realizing it!"

      "content": "Stand the first pallet upright, slats horizontal, along the string line. Position the pallet so that the outside of it just touches up against the string line. If the pallet won’t stand up straight, move it out of the way and use your shovel to level out the ground some more. (Or, have someone else hold the pallet in position while you take care of the next step.) [3] X Research source Putting the pallet’s slats in a horizontal position means that there is solid wood along the vertical sides where the pallet fence panels meet together. Putting the slats vertical leaves open gaps (meant for forklift tines) along the vertical sides."

Slip the end of the pound-in metal fence post with the arrow-shaped blade into the opening at the top of the pallet, right alongside the vertical wood that runs along the vertical edge of the pallet. [4] X Research source Drive the post down into the ground with a small sledgehammer or a post driver until the blade is fully underground. [5] X Research source For a “kind of sturdy” fence, drive in only one post, on the edge of the pallet that is either the endpoint or a corner of the fence. For a “pretty sturdy” fence, drive in two posts, one on each edge of the pallet. For a “really sturdy” fence, check out the other method in this article! To build a fence made of typical 40 in × 48 in (100 cm × 120 cm) pallets, use 5 ft (1.5 m) metal fence posts."

Lift and slide the second pallet into place so that it’s just touching the string line and is butted up right against the first pallet. Drive another fence post into the ground against the inside edge of the second pallet—on the side furthest from the meeting point with the first pallet. [6] X Research source Try to keep the second pallet lined up while you pound in the post, but don’t worry if it moves a little. You’ll be attaching it to the first pallet shortly. If you’re looking to build that “pretty sturdy” fence instead, go ahead and drive 2 posts into the second pallet, one at each end."

Stand up one of the boards and line it up over top of the joint where the 2 pallets meet. Drill at least 8 pilot holes through the 2x4 board (at least 4 apiece into each pallet), then drive 2.5 in (6.4 cm) screws through the board and into the pallets.

      "content": "Repeat the process along your fence line. Installing a pallet fence this way is mostly just a repetitive process of lining up the pallets, pounding in posts, and screwing together the pallet fence panels. But here are a few complications you might face: [8] X Research source Corners: Line up the 2 pallets at a 90-degree angle so that one overlaps the edge of the other at the corner. Drill through each of the interior slats of the overlapping pallet and into the side vertical support of the covered pallet, then drive in 2.25 in (5.7 cm) screws. Cut pallets: If you need to cut a pallet to fit your fencing area, aim to cut through the horizontal slats right up alongside the vertical support that runs up the center of the pallet. You’ll basically end up with a half-width pallet fence panel that will install in the same fashion. Gates: Check out the next step!"

      "content": "Attach a pallet gate with hinges, if needed. A gate on a pound-in post pallet fence will inevitably be a little wobbly, so you may want to consider setting the gate posts in concrete (if so, see the next section). But, if you prefer to stick with the pound-in method, do the following: [9] X Research source Leave the gap for the gate opening about 1–2 in (2.5–5.1 cm) wider than the width of a pallet. Secure the pallets on either side of the gate opening with 2 pound-in posts apiece. Lay scraps of wood on the ground to prop up the gate pallet about 1–2 in (2.5–5.1 cm) off the ground. Screw in at least 3 gate hinges on one side of the gate pallet and the fence pallet beside it. [10] X Research source Install the gate latch on the side of the gate pallet opposite to the hinges."

If you’re using common 40 in × 48 in (100 cm × 120 cm) pallets, for example, lay out the fence posts so that there is 80 in (200 cm) of open space—the width of 2 pallets—between each post. That way the pallets will slip right into place when it’s time to attach them to the posts. [11] X Research source If you’re making a gate opening, leave only 41–42 in (100–110 cm) of space between a pair of fence posts in that location."

Use a manual post hole digger or power auger to dig post holes that are at least 2.5 ft (0.76 m) deep and 12 in (30 cm) in diameter. [12] X Research source 30 in (76 cm) is typically the minimum digging depth for fence posts, and it works well for a 4 ft (1.2 m) high pallet fence. At this depth—and after adding some crushed stone to the bottom—at least 1/3 of the total length of your 4x4 posts will be buried underground, making for a sturdy fence."

Angle the 2x4s so they’re touching the ground, then drive a wooden stake into the ground right up against each one.

Either fill the fence post hole with concrete up to about 1 in (2.5 cm) below the surface (so you can cover it with soil), or mound it up around the base of the post about 1 in (2.5 cm) above the surface (to help shed water). Do the same with all the other posts. Let the concrete set up for at least 3 days (or whatever is recommended on the package) before proceeding. If you’re using a quick-set concrete , pour the dry mix into the hole, then pour in water, all according to the specific product instructions."

Add 2 in (5.1 cm) to the height of your pallets—for example, 50 in (130 cm) for 48 in (120 cm) pallets—and measure up from ground level for each post. Cut the posts to that height with a circular saw or other saw of your choice. [15] X Research source The extra 2 in (5.1 cm) is for ground clearance so that your pallets are flush with the top of the posts but not touching the ground."

Reach in between the pallet slats to drill pilot holes and drive 2.25 in (5.7 cm) screws through the pallet structure and into the posts. Drive in at least 6 screws per side. [16] X Research source While it’s possible to do this job solo, it’ll definitely be easier with a second (and even third) set of hands!

Simply use longer 4x4 posts and cut them to 98 in (250 cm) after installation, and stack one pallet on top of another to create the higher fence. Connect the pallets together and to the posts as before. [19] X Research source To make your double-height fence more sturdy, consider setting your posts with 40 in (100 cm) spacing instead of 80 in (200 cm) so that each stacked pair of pallets is secured to two posts. Check for any fence height restrictions where you live before building this kind of fence. If you’re limited to a 6 ft (1.8 m) high fence, for example, you’ll have to cut each top pallet in your stacked fence in half."

Start by building your fence using either method outlined in this article. The roughly 4 in (10 cm) gap between the horizontal slats at the top of the fence will serve as your planter row. Simply staple landscape fabric in the gap to create a sling that you can fill with potting soil and your favorite flowers. [20] X Research source"

Here are the basics: [21] X Research source Connect a series of pallets side-by-side with gate hinges (2-3 hinges per connection). Alternate the sides of the gate hinges so your standing fence can have a zig-zag (or accordion-style) pattern. Install 2 heavy-duty caster wheels on the bottom of each pallet fence panel. Stand the fence upright on the wheels and adjust the panels into a zig-zag/accordion pattern so they’re sturdy. Wheel the fence into position (this fence works best on a flat, hard surface, such as a patio or driveway). When you’re done with the fence, fold the panels flat for storage."
