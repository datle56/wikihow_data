      "content": "The song is about having passion and pride while being true to yourself. The song celebrates the success Richman has earned through all his hard work and dedication to his craft—but it also serves as a reminder not to lose your head in your search for success and fame. Lyrics like “I ain’t never rep a set, baby, / I ain’t do no wrong” really showcase Richman’s ambition, self-confidence, and pride. He knows his worth (and so do we!). The phrase “rep a set” often refers to representing a gang, but Richman claims he’s not affiliated with anything like that—and the lyric that follows (“I ain’t do no wrong”) might further hint that he tries to follow the straight-and-narrow. These lyrics could be a critique of the glorification of gang life Richman sees among young men in his circles."

      "content": "The song is also about the importance of love and loyalty. Tommy Richman is a real one, y’all. And just as the song is about being true to yourself as you follow your dreams and chase success, it’s also about being true to the person you love and working to be as good of a person as you can for them. Richman’s willingness to be the best version of himself for someone he loves is emphasized in lyrics like, “I could clean up good for you / Oh, I know right from wrong.” Later in the song, Richman sings, “She a bad li’l mama, she a diva, / No matter what happens, he cannot come between us again,” suggesting their relationship may have once been on the rocks, but that he’s determined not to let anything break them apart again. He also sings about “[taking] her to Queen’s Gambit,” a karaoke bar in his hometown of Woodbridge, VA, and “[showing] around my friends,” suggesting this girl is important to him: he’s inviting her to one of his favorite haunts and introducing her to his circle."

      "content": "“Million Dollar Baby” is a tribute to Richman’s home state of Virginia. With lyrics like “You rep my city for so damn long / But you still don’t notice me, my sound next, / VA next,” “Million Dollar Baby” is Richman’s attempt to put Virginia on the map as a major player in the music industry—but it’s also a reminder to not take your roots for granted or forget where you came from. Richman isn’t the only one looking to put the DMV (D.C., Maryland, and Virginia) area on the map: he was signed to fellow artist and DMV native Brent Faiyaz’s label ISO Supremacy in 2023 and has since joined Faiyaz on his F*ck the World, It's a Wasteland Tour and collaborated on Faiyaz’s track “Upset.”"

      "content": "The song took off on TikTok before its official release. When we say it took off, we mean took off . The then-still relatively unknown Richman began teasing snippets of the song on TikTok in spring 2024 before its release, and these teases garnered lots of attention on the app—to the point that when the song was officially released on April 26, it was an immediate hit, gaining 4.6 million on-demand U.S. streams that day alone. [2] X Research source “Million Dollar Baby” was released through ISO Supremacy and Pulse Records. The song was written by Tommy Richman, with production credits from Jonah Roy, Max Vossberg, Mannyvelli, Sparkheem, and Kavi. It was later redistributed by Concord and Universal Music Group.

      "content": "The song peaked at #2 on the Billboard Hot 100. A big enough accomplishment on its own, but it did this a week after Taylor Swift’s Tortured Poets Department was released— and in the midst of Kendrick Lamar and Drake’s rap feud , which was dominating YouTube at the time. That’s power, baby. [5] X Research source After also reaching #1 on the Billboard Top 50, the song occupied that top slot for 10 weeks in a row, starting in May 2024. The song also topped the charts in other countries, including Australia, Latvia, and New Zealand. Barack Obama even included the song on his yearly summer playlist in 2024, alongside other hits of the year like Beyoncé’s “Texas Hold ‘Em” and “365” by brat summer icon Charli XCX.

      "content": "The song is a fusion of hip-hop, R&B, trap, rap, funk, and psychedelia. Tommy Richman takes pride in his refusal not to confine himself to specific genre labels, which makes his music both amazing…and somewhat difficult to categorize ! “Million Dollar Baby” is mostly considered R&B, but it borrows from a wide variety of genres, including funk, Southern trap, and psychedelic music. While the song’s admittedly somewhat hard to categorize, it’s because of its confident fusion of various influences—in addition to the compelling lyrics, intoxicating melody, and Tommy Richman’s captivating falsetto—that “Million Dollar Baby” became the hit it is."
