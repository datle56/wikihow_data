      "title": "Cut off a snake plant leaf with pruning shears, scissors, or a knife.",
      "content": "Cut off a snake plant leaf with pruning shears, scissors, or a knife. Make your cut near the soil, close to the leaf’s base. Choose a leaf that’s about 6 inches (15 cm) or more tall and dark green. If the leaf is browning, that’s a sign it’s getting old and shouldn’t be used to propagate. [1] X Research source If the leaf is large enough, propagate multiple plants from it by cutting it into several smaller pieces (about 4 inches (10 cm) long)."

      "content": "Make an upside down V or slanted cut at the bottom of the leaf. Use your shears, scissors, or a sharp knife. The cut reminds you which end of the leaf is the bottom (it won’t root or grow if you plant it upside down!). It also adds more surface area for roots to grow from. [2] X Research source Make a cut at the bottom of each leaf or leaf cutlet you’re propagating."
    },
    {
      "title": "Let the cut leaf dry for 1 to 2 days.",
      "content": "Let the cut leaf dry for 1 to 2 days. Allowing the leaf to dry lets the cuts callous over and heal. This is an important step to take to prevent your cuttings from rotting. Lay your cutting somewhere safe and away from direct sunlight to dry. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Place the leaf in a clean jar filled with about 3 inches (7.6 cm) of water. The water level should be just slightly higher than the top of your V cut at the bottom of the leaf. Leave the jar in a spot that gets lots of indirect sunlight and replace the water about once a week.

      "content": "Wait 3 to 5 weeks for roots to begin growing from the base of the cutting. Depending on the plant, it may take up to 2 months for the snake plant cutting to root. About 2 or 3 weeks after roots begin forming, you’ll see small pups (baby leaves or offshoots) forming. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Transplant the cutting in soil when the roots are 1 inch (2.5 cm) long.",
      "content": "Transplant the cutting in soil when the roots are 1 inch (2.5 cm) long. Pot the plant about 1.5 inches (3.8 cm) deep in moist, well-draining houseplant potting mix or succulent soil. Place your pot in a bright spot that receives lots of indirect sunlight. [6] X Research source Improve the drainage of your soil by mixing in some perlite or pumice . Young snake plants rot if the soil is too wet. Only water about every 2 weeks or whenever the top 2 inches (5.1 cm) of soil feel dry to the touch. Choose a porous pot , like one made of terracotta or clay, that allows some moisture to move through it."

The leaf doesn’t have to be as long as you’d need to root in water—about 3 inches (7.6 cm) long is fine.

      "content": "Use scissors or a knife to make a notched cut at the bottom of the leaf. An upside down V shape or slanted edge will work great. The cut is to indicate which side of the leaf is the bottom (it also increases the available surface area for roots to grow from). Cut each leaf or leaf segment this way.

      "content": "Dip the bottom of each leaf in rooting hormone powder. Rooting hormone is a chemical compound you apply to cuttings to increase your chance of propagation success. It helps prevent rotting and speeds up the cutting’s rooting process. First, dip the leaf cutting in water. Then dip the bottom 0.25 inches (0.64 cm) of the cutting in the hormone powder. [10] X Research source Purchase root hormone powder or make your own mixture at home."

The soil should be moist but well-draining (too much moisture can drown or rot a young snake plant). The bottom of the cutting should be about 1.5 inches (3.8 cm) deep in the soil. [11] X Research source Keep your fresh cutting somewhere that gets bright, indirect sunlight (too much direct light can damage the plant). If you’re concerned your soil isn’t draining well, mix in perlite or pumice . Choose a pot made from porous material , like terracotta or clay. Only water whenever the top 2 inches (5.1 cm) of soil feel dry to the touch (about every 2 weeks)."

      "content": "Check for new leaves and shoots in about 2 months. If you see growth, this is a sign that the cutting is healthy and rooted! If desired, you can cut away the original leaf. If you suspect the cutting is rooted but you don’t see growth, adjust the temperature in the snake plant’s room—it will develop more quickly above 60 °F (16 °C). [12] X Research source Another quick rooting test is to lightly tug on the cutting. If you feel resistance, it’s rooted! If it slides right out, replant it and continue watering only when the soil has dried out."

The goal is to divide the tangled ball of roots into sections (with their leaves attached) that can be replanted independent of the mother plant and grow. If needed, use a sharp knife or scissors to divide the roots. [14] X Trustworthy Source Penn State Extension Educational organization dedicated to delivering science-based information to people, businesses, and communities Go to source Each division should have at least 3 leaves attached to their accompanying roots (or at least a little bit of a leafy top or pups attached). Create as many divisions as you like—each division will grow into a new plant identical to the original. If your snake plant has pups (small offshoots), remove those instead of rummaging through the root system. Rooting a pup will give you a smaller plant than a full division."

If the plant starts leaning to one side, add more soil until it’s secure. [15] X Trustworthy Source Penn State Extension Educational organization dedicated to delivering science-based information to people, businesses, and communities Go to source Keep each pot in a bright area of your home that gets plenty of indirect sunlight. Giving each division its own pot leaves plenty of room for new growth and root development.
