To share an entire folder, select Add directory , and choose the folder. [3] X Research source Be careful when selecting an entire folder to share—don't share your entire Documents or Desktop folder unless you want someone to be able to access all of the files inside of that folder. After selecting a file or folder, make sure you don't move it—the files you want to share have to stay in the same location so others can download them."

      "title": "Choose whether to make the torrent private.",
      "content": "Choose whether to make the torrent private. If you just want to share the file(s) with one person, you can check the box next to \"Private.\" This means that as long as your IP address does not change, your file(s) will be available to download only by people who know about the torrent. Restarting your router might change your IP address, so keep this in mind if sharing a private torrent. If you don't care who has access to the file, you can leave \"Private\" unchecked. Anyone will be able to download the torrent, but only if they know your IP address and port number. If you are using a dynamic IP address that changes often, this is going to be a better option."

The torrent will only download when both you and your friend are online at the same time and you have uTorrent open and seeding."
