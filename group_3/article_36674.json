      "content": "Understand the difference between a sealed record and an expunged record. If a criminal record is sealed, it’s hidden from the general public but still exists. Sealed records can actually be unsealed in some instances. Expungement, on the other hand, erases the record permanently. If your record is sealed, the felony typically will not appear when someone runs a criminal background check on you, as when you apply for a job or seek to rent an apartment. [1] X Research source Some states (Illinois, for example) do not allow records of any felony convictions to be either expunged or sealed under any circumstances absent pardon from the governor."

      "title": "Make sure the required time has elapsed since your conviction.",
      "content": "Make sure the required time has elapsed since your conviction. All states require you to wait a few years after you’ve served your sentence before you can get your record sealed. During that waiting period, you should go out of your way to avoid any further brushes with the law. The waiting period may differ depending on the severity of your crime. For example, Massachusetts requires you to wait ten years before applying to have a felony record sealed, compared to five years for a misdemeanor conviction. [2] X Research source Know when the waiting period starts. In some states you must first complete any period of probation and pay all fines. In other states the waiting period begins the day you’re convicted. Elsewhere it may begin on the day you leave jail. [3] X Research source In many states, records may be sealed upon request after a certain period of time has elapsed without further review. However, you must maintain a clean record during that waiting period."

In others you can mail them to the probation office.

In other states sealing a record is an administrative process requiring nothing from you apart from your signature on the petition.

Your records will automatically be sealed, although it may take some time for that to happen.

      "content": "Find out if expungement is available in the state where you were convicted. Expungement acts to dismiss the felony, almost as though it never happened. Only 16 states allow expungement of a conviction. [8] X Research source The general public may not know about your expunged felony, but law enforcement agencies and courts still have access to that part of your record. If you’re convicted of another crime after having a prior conviction expunged, the expunged conviction may add to the severity of your sentence. Most states don’t allow expungement of serious, violent felonies. Some states do not allow you to expunge felonies at all. [9] X Research source If you live in a state where this is true, you will have to work to get your felony reduced to a misdemeanor, and then you could possibly get that misdemeanor expunged. Some states allow the expungement of arrests only. [10] X Research source If you live in a state like this, you might not be able to expunge felony or misdemeanor convictions at all. Even if you’re successful in getting your conviction expunged, you may still have to disclose it in some instances, such as if you’re applying for a professional license or a job in law enforcement."

Depending on the state, you might have to wait several years after your conviction before you can file to have your record expunged. The length of time you have to wait can depend on several factors, including your age and the severity of the crime. Those factors vary from state to state. The waiting period doesn’t start until after you’ve finished all aspects of your sentence. This includes successfully completing any probation period and paying all fines."

      "content": "Gather your records. In many states you’ll have to present police and court records about your felony when you file for expungement. You probably will have to pay fees for certified copies of those documents. You also will need copies of your criminal history and fingerprint records from the arresting police department. In some states, such as Florida, you also must have new fingerprints taken to submit with your expungement petition."

The clerk’s office will have a list of local process-serving companies, and you’ll have to use one of those. You’ll pay fees to file your expungement request, which usually amount to a few hundred dollars. If your state requires you to serve the forms, there will be fees for that service as well. These fees are nonrefundable. When the clerk stamps and files your petition, s/he will give you a docket number and schedule your hearing."

The hearing may be less formal than a trial, but you should treat it with the same respect. Dress neatly and conservatively, and arrive early with copies of all the documents you’ve filed. The judge or parole board must decide if you’ve been successfully rehabilitated, so you may be asked questions about your education, home and family life, financial health, physical well-being, and employment. Police officers and district attorneys may attend your hearing to object to the expungement of your record. If the judge grants your expungement, you need copies of the signed Expungement Order to deliver to law enforcement agencies. The clerk’s office will let you know where to send them. If the judge denies your request for expungement, ask him/her to list the reasons for the denial and to explain what you can do in response. After a period of time, during which you resolve those issues, you may well be able to reapply for expungement. [13] X Research source"

It not only erases or seals a record but establishes that the record should never have existed in the first place. [14] X Research source Generally you can file a petition for this certificate if you believe you are innocent of a crime for which you were convicted, and you’ve discovered new and exonerating evidence that wasn’t available at the time of your conviction. [15] X Research source Certificates of Actual Innocence serve to overturn wrongful convictions. For example, an accused person might be pressured to give a false confession after being unlawfully interrogated. [16] X Research source Constitutional claims leading to Certificates of Actual Innocence often are brought by nonprofit legal-aid societies such as the Innocence Project or by clinics at law schools.

Generally you cannot have had any further brushes with the law and must be a responsible and law-abiding member of the community.

However, a notice will be added, stating that you’ve been pardoned (forgiven) for committing the crime. Your civil rights, including the chance to own a firearm and serve on a jury, will be restored.
