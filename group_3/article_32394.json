To familiarize yourself with the 7 core concepts of life insurance, focus on all the unique ways that insurance contracts address either personal injuries or car accidents. Start by reading a brief review of each key item. Then, reflect on what would “breach,” or go against, these important 7 principles: Principle of Utmost Good Faith : the policyholder and the insurer should act in “good faith,” or with honesty and positive intentions. Principle of Insurable Interest : the item or property listed in a contract, such as a car, is worth money, so the insurer or policyholder would face a financial loss if it was damaged Principle of Indemnity : a promise to repay the policyholder for any losses that they suffered from an injury of accident Principle of Contribution : each insurance company a policyholder has a contract with will cover the amount of losses they originally agreed to pay for Principle of Subrogation : the policyholder has the ability to substitute one insurance company for another one Principle of Loss Minimization : it is the policyholder’s responsibility to avoid injuries or accidents as much as possible Principle of Causa Proxima (Nearest Cause) : not all losses are likely to be covered by one type of insurance contract"
