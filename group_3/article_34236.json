      "content": "Change your home's exterior door locks if you've recently moved in. For the optimum security, your home needs to be outfitted with strong deadbolts and door locks to keep your stuff and your family safe. You can do this yourself , as door locks are easy and inexpensive to replace. [1] X Research source Once you do, always lock them and instruct anybody else you live with to always lock them. It's possible that previous residents likely have kept a spare key, so it's a good idea to change the locks if you've just moved in, to help prevent theft."

      "title": "Consider getting an alarm system installed.",
      "content": "Consider getting an alarm system installed. Having an alarm reduces the likelihood of a break-in, and makes the effects of a break-in much more minor. You can engage the alarm when you're away, as well as setting it to night or stay mode, for your own safety while you're in for the night. Invest in a system that will alert the police (or fire station) immediately and your home phone should receive a call from them asking if everything is all right. [2] X Research source Shop around for the best monthly monitoring prices. The brands you probably recognise from television cost four times per month more than other companies that are probably local to you. Knowing the pricing of other companies will help you negotiate a lower rate. [3] X Research source Be sure to set the alarm each time you go out, and change the code every year or two, using something hard to guess, but easy to remember. If the alarm company offers signs for windows or your lawn, use them. The whole idea is to make your home less attractive for potential burglars."

      "content": "Have anti-shatter plastic installed on your windows. You can help prevent theft at your home by putting a clear thick window film on your ground floor and basement windows to keep them from being broken. There are clear, frosted and reflective (mirrored) films, depending on your privacy needs. This is commonly used in countries with a high number of earthquakes to prevent shattering, and is also useful to resist a break-and-enter type of theft."

      "title": "Keep an eye out for your neighbors.",
      "content": "Keep an eye out for your neighbors. Help your neighborhood by getting to know the cars and habits of your neighbors. This may seem like a little thing, but thieves really do target places where they think they are blending in or not noticed. Once they know someone is very aware of them, they will feel uncomfortable and will quickly move on. As you probably can't be at home all the time, this works best if you can encourage your neighbors to do the same. [4] X Research source [5] X Expert Source Saul Jaeger, MS Police Captain, Mountain View Police Department Expert Interview. 21 February 2020. If you see someone strange or a strange vehicle near your house, go out and offer to help them with directions (pretend to think that they are lost) or otherwise engage them \"how are you, how is your day.\" Be polite and never challenge them (\"what are you doing here\") as a confrontation could be a risk to safety. A thief will talk as little as possible and then move on to another neighborhood."

      "title": "Never invite strangers into your home.",
      "content": "Never invite strangers into your home. If they arrive at your door, go outside to talk with them, locking your door behind. Many thieves use some excuse to come into the home to get some idea of what to steal. Going outside will help deter them. If they ask, politely say no. [6] X Research source If they claim to be from your town government, ask to see ID first and take their picture using your mobile phone. A real government official won't be upset by this and may even praise you on being safe. Always document strangers who come around or seem suspicious in some way. Take a quick picture just to have it in case something happens in the future."

[8] X Expert Source Saul Jaeger, MS Police Captain, Mountain View Police Department Expert Interview. 21 February 2020. If you're concerned about security at your home, consider investing in a family pet who will have the added benefit of barking its head off any time someone comes around with ill intent. This can help you feel safe and provide you with an added layer of security."
