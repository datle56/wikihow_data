      "content": "Consider your options. Because of increasing banking and identification security regulations in the United States, you will likely have difficulty finding a bank that will accept a third-party check. [1] X Research source If you have a banking account and can deposit or cash the check written to you, it is almost certainly going to be easier for you to do that, then write your own check (or hand the cash) to the third party. Signing over a check may seem like it would be more convenient (by cutting out the middleman, so to speak), but is unlikely to be so anymore. Look into electronic transfers of funds to your third party, either through your existing bank accounts or a service such as PayPal, if you are seeking another convenient option. If you: 1) have a check written to you; 2) don't have a bank account; and 3) need to pay a third party the amount of the check written to you, this is the only real scenario in which you might want to try to sign over a check. See Part III of this article for other options in this scenario."

      "content": "Confirm that the person you want to endorse the check to, the third party, will accept a signed-over check. Ask the person if they have used a third-party check at their bank before. This will improve your chances of success since there are no laws requiring banks to accept third-party checks."

If you cannot contact the person immediately but know their bank branch, you can call the bank's customer service number to inquire about special endorsements of this kind. [2] X Research source Ask if any special procedures are required by the bank to accept the third-party check. Some banks have enacted their own rules governing these procedures, such as requiring that both parties have accounts at the bank to ensure the funds can be transferred."

If it is possible for you to open an account, do so, because it will make this situation (and likely others) simpler. To open a checking account at a U.S. bank, you generally need to be 18 or older; provide basic information such as full name, address, contact information (phone / email), and Social Security number; and show a government-issued photo ID. [5] X Research source You should be able to find a no-fee checking account at one of your local banks. Also look into online banks, where free checking accounts are more typical."

Checks with \"or bearer\" written following the name of the payee can be deposited or cashed (typically, depending on bank policies) by whoever presents the check. [6] X Research source The third party should be prepared to present identification when depositing or cashing the check, depending on the policies of the financial institution, especially if the check is for a larger amount. Checks written out to \"cash or bearer\" or just \"bearer\" will work similarly."

Check-cashing charges generally range somewhere between 1% and 12% of the check amount, so shopping around for the best deal can pay off. Some national retailers, including Walmart, provide this service. [7] X Research source You will need a photo ID to cash the check."
