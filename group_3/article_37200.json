      "title": "Decide on a station to call in to.",
      "content": "Decide on a station to call in to. Turn on the radio to a station that plays the type of music you like. You should understand the type of music they play before calling in. Listen out for DJs that encourage call-ins. Research the station and save the station’s phone number into your phone. Most radio shows even have a page on their site that lists the recent or most play songs. This will give you a sense of what music they prefer and if your request is relevant."

      "title": "Know what song you want to request.",
      "content": "Know what song you want to request. Some people go through the steps and when it’s time to request a track, they freeze up and waste their call. Have a few songs prepared in case the station doesn’t have your first choice. [1] X Research source Make sure your song selections match the genre or theme of the radio station you’ve decided on."

    {
      "title": "Give yourself time.",
      "content": "Give yourself time. Listen to the radio station for a while before requesting your song. This will help you in case the song is played before you have a chance to request it. About a half hour later, you could try to call the station number."
    },
    {
      "title": "Call in your request.",
      "content": "Call in your request. You may get a busy signal, so hang up and try again until you reach the station’s operator. Usually you’ll speak to someone who will screen you before talking to the DJ. Speak clearly into the phone."
    },
    {
      "title": "Talk to the DJ.",
      "content": "Talk to the DJ. Some radio stations will broadcast your request over the air. They may ask you where you are from, the station you are listening to, and your name. Refrain from using inappropriate language or else your song request will not be honored."
    },
    {
      "title": "Listen to the radio.",
      "content": "Listen to the radio. Listen and hopefully the song you requested will be played. Not every request will be played on air. Be patient and don’t create a grudge if they don’t play your song."
    },
    {
      "title": "Research a radio station.",
      "content": "Research a radio station. Some radio stations will only allow you to request a song through the internet. After finding a radio station that you enjoy, look the station up online. Most radio stations have a website and pages for a show on that station."
    },
    {
      "title": "Submit a request through a form.",
      "content": "Submit a request through a form. More and more stations set up an electronic form to request a song. The form will typically ask for your name, email, location, and information about what type of music you like. Fill these out to best of your ability. Depending on the radio station, you will receive information about the request you submitted. Some stations won’t send you any information about your request. Fill out several forms and hope for a response."
    },
    {
      "title": "Request a song through social media.",
      "content": "Request a song through social media. Many radio shows will have their own social media page that is separate from the station’s website. Look through the history of the radio show’s comments and look for song requests. If you see other people requesting tracks, you have a chance yourself. Be polite and enthusiastic when requesting through social media websites. The show’s web coordinator will appreciate a fan of the show and might honor a request by her."

    {
      "title": "Compliment the DJ.",
      "content": "Compliment the DJ. Nobody will want to play your request if you comment “you never play good songs so please play Hounds of Love by Kate Bush.” Instead, you could compliment them for a specific hour you heard last Thursday after work. If you follow the latter with a song request, your chances are higher of being honored. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Know the song name before chatting. Getting in touch with a DJ for a request is not the easiest process these days. Have respect for the DJ and know the name of the song. [3] X Research source Do not sing or say something like, “it’s the song that goes “Nah de dah nah; hey hey hey.” They aren’t taking your call to be quizzed."

      "title": "Listen to the station.",
      "content": "Listen to the station. After going through your steps in requesting a song just listen to the station. Part of letting listeners request a song is a ploy for radio stations to gather more listeners. Be patient and if your song doesn’t play, don’t sweat it. Try again if you still have the urge."
