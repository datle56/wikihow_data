      "content": "Ensure the liquid leather matches perfectly. You can send a small swatch of the leather (there will be extra underneath the seat) to the liquid leather distributor to find an exact match. Or, provide the color code or name to the distributor to make sure you get the right shade. Liquid leather is a combination filler and adhesive compound that can be purchased online and in many auto parts and upholstery stores. Test the product in an inconspicuous spot before applying it to the rest of the seat. Adjust the color with the provided toner or exchange it for a better match, if necessary."
