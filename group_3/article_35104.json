      "title": "He needs some time alone.",
      "content": "He needs some time alone. Since they’re really emotional, Cancers sometimes need time to work through their feelings. Once he feels better, he’ll come back to you completely refreshed. It’s normal to feel nervous when your man needs time away from you, but it could actually help your relationship be stronger. To find out if this is the problem, ask him if he just wants some time to himself. Being alone can actually give him time to realize your relationship is important to him. Cancers are the sign most associated with home. He wants to feel cozy and comforted by familiar surroundings, and sometimes this makes him check out from the world around him for a while."
    },
    {
      "title": "He wants more affection.",
      "content": "He wants more affection. Cancers highly value closeness and touching in a relationship. You probably give him lots of affection, but if he wants more, he’s temporarily pulling away because he’s feeling unfulfilled. To figure out if this is the problem, think back to the past week or two to see if there’s been a sudden dip in physical intimacy. Maybe you just haven’t had time to go out on a date recently, or perhaps you’ve just had less time to hold hands and cuddle."
    },
    {
      "title": "He feels like you aren’t communicating well.",
      "content": "He feels like you aren’t communicating well. Communication is super important to Cancers, and they pull away if they feel like you aren’t connecting. He may think you aren’t opening up about your emotions, or he could feel ignored. Ask yourself if you’re being open and honest with him about how you feel. If not, this could be the issue."
    },
    {
      "title": "He’s feeling hurt or angry.",
      "content": "He’s feeling hurt or angry. Since he’s so sensitive, he’s easily hurt and takes things personally. A Cancer man is often more comfortable processing his feelings in private. When he’s upset, he'll usually storm away to think things over. [1] X Research source Review the past few days to see if anything could have hurt or angered him. Keep in mind that even something innocent could upset him, since he feels so deeply. You may not have done anything wrong."
    },
    {
      "title": "He’s feeling defensive.",
      "content": "He’s feeling defensive. As one of their weaknesses, Cancers can get hyper-sensitive and take things personally. When this happens, he may pull away as a defense mechanism to feeling attacked. [2] X Research source Chances are, he’ll come back around soon. Look for these other signs that he might be defensive: [3] X Research source He verbally attacked you. He insists you’re wrong. He bent the truth to win an argument. He tried to convince you that you misunderstood him."
    },
    {
      "title": "He’s not sure how he feels about you.",
      "content": "He’s not sure how he feels about you. Cancers like to take their time when falling in love. He wants to make sure he’s absolutely head-over-heels for you before he gets too close to you. [4] X Research source Consider how far along you are in your relationship to figure out if this may be your problem. This could be the case if you’re reaching a milestone moment, like the 3rd date, 1-month mark, or 6-month mark. He may be wondering what comes next. Once a Cancer man commits to you, he’ll be super loyal and devoted to you. He’s definitely worth the wait!"

    {
      "title": "He’s worried you aren’t ready to commit.",
      "content": "He’s worried you aren’t ready to commit. As an emotional person, a Cancer man is going to protect his heart. He won’t let you crack his protective shell until he knows your intentions. Have you talked about your future yet? If not, this could be your issue. Ask him if he wants to talk about where your relationship is going. Say: “I’m really excited to see where this relationship goes. When you’re ready, I’m open to discussing our future.” “We’ve been dating for a while now, and I really enjoy spending time with you. Do you think we should start talking about our future?”"

      "title": "He’s worried you don’t get along with his family or friends.",
      "content": "He’s worried you don’t get along with his family or friends. Cancers are loyal to a fault, so they prioritize the people they love. Your man wants a partner who cares about his friends and family as much as he does. If he thinks you’re at odds with them, he might pull away to mull things over. [5] X Research source Review all of the interactions you’ve had with his friends to see if this could be the problem. He’s loyal to you, too, so don’t worry if you occasionally have conflicts with other people in his life. He just wants to make sure you all care about each other."

    {
      "title": "He’s keeping a secret.",
      "content": "He’s keeping a secret. Since Cancers are ruled by the moon, they’re very secretive and mysterious. When they’re hiding something, they naturally pull away so you won’t catch on. [6] X Research source If you suspect he’s hiding something, trust your gut and ask him about it. You could say, “Lately, I’ve noticed some distance between us, and it seems like there’s something you’re not telling me. Is something going on?”"
    },
    {
      "title": "He’s playing you.",
      "content": "He’s playing you. Sometimes Cancer guys test you to see if you’ll stick around, so he might distance himself to see if you’ll work harder to keep him. When a Cancer man is playing you, he won’t do the things he normally does in a relationship, like nurture you. Look for these signs he might be playing you: [7] X Research source He rushes the beginning of a relationship, then pulls away. He ignores you for weeks at a time. He stands you up for dates. He won’t introduce you to his friends and family. He only cares about what he wants. He never talks about his feelings or the future."

    {
      "title": "He’s losing interest in the relationship.",
      "content": "He’s losing interest in the relationship. Because Cancers are passive and non-confrontational, he’ll try to avoid breaking up with you. Instead, he might distance himself from you so you get frustrated and dump him. [8] X Research source Even though it’s hard, talk to him to find out what’s really going on. Since Cancers are ruled by the moon, they’re very intuitive. That means he picks up on your emotions and may assume that you’re doing the same. Because of this, he might think you already know why he’s pulling away."

      "content": "Stay positive because it’s normal for people to need their independence. It’s scary when your partner suddenly seems distant, but Cancers are known for their tendency to pull away because they’re moody. Try not to panic because every relationship will experience moments like this. If you’re feeling worried, distract yourself by doing something fun with a friend, engaging in self care, or doing a hobby.

You could say something like: “I’ve noticed you’ve been distant lately. What can I do to help us feel close again?” “Lately, I’ve got the feeling you need something more from our relationship. Can we talk about this?” “You’re so important to me. Is there something you need from me that I haven’t been giving you?”"

Say something like: “I’m just thinking about wrapping my arms around you and kissing you softly on the lips.” “I love cuddling with you on the sofa. I can’t wait until I can hold you close again.” “I have a hug and a kiss for you when I see you next.”"
