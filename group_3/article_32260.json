      "content": "Use a paint scraper or a putty knife to scrape away loose paint. Press the scraper or knife firmly against the paint, but make sure you don’t damage the metal underneath. Don’t worry about patches where the paint is in good shape, as you can simply paint over those. To help the primer and paint adhere to the roof better, try lightly scuffing the surface of the metal. For instance, if you're painting a smaller roof, you might use 80-120 grit sandpaper or a wire brush. [1] X Expert Source Patrick Coye Painting Specialist Expert Interview. 22 July 2020."

      "content": "Wash the roof with a power washer . A power washer will be able to remove any areas of peeling paint you might have missed. It will also clean the roof, preparing it for the next coat of paint. Rent a power washer from a local home improvement store. Spray down your entire roof, moving the wand side to side to catch the whole surface. [2] X Research source If you can’t get a power washer, use your garden hose on the strongest setting. It is not as effective, but it can still clean the roof."

      "content": "Wait at least an hour for the roof to dry. How long it will take your roof to dry completely depends on the temperature and how sunny it is. Check the last area you washed after an hour. If it’s still wet, check again every 15 minutes or so. The roof needs to be completely dry before you move forward."

      "content": "Choose a day with good weather. Avoid painting in the rain, as this could wash your paint away. If possible, try to paint in the spring or fall. Metal roofs can get extremely hot in the summer, making them very difficult to work with."

      "title": "Apply a coat of primer to the entire roof.",
      "content": "Apply a coat of primer to the entire roof. Use a paintbrush or a paint roller to spread the primer. You need only one coat, but it should be a thick coat. Work from your ladder whenever possible. Carefully go onto your roof for areas that are hard to reach from the ladder. Purchase a roller with a long handle from a home improvement store. This allows you to reach further from your ladder. [3] X Research source"

When applying your additional coat, try working from different positions than you did for the first coat. This might help you hit spots you missed before. After the second coat, your roof should be well protected and have a nice color. If the color doesn’t seem dark or rich enough yet, apply an additional coat. [6] X Research source Always wait for the previous coat to dry before adding a new one."

Instead, choose a neutral color that complements the sides, or a lighter color that gives an accent to your home. If your house is made of brick or stone, it is especially important to make sure your roof complements these materials, as their colors cannot be changed."

      "content": "Work from an extension ladder instead of going on the roof if possible. It’s usually safer to work from a ladder instead of on the roof. Lean the ladder against your house. Keep the ladder away from power lines. Do not place the ladder in front of any doors, as someone opening a door could knock the ladder down. [10] X Research source Always keep both feet firmly against a rung of the ladder, and hold onto the side of the ladder with the hand you’re not working with. [11] X Research source When painting from your ladder, don’t try to extend your reach to paint areas that are too far away. This could cause you to lose your balance and fall. Instead, use a paint roller with a long handle to reach patches far away from you."
