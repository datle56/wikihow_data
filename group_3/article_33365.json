Pass the Presidential Candidate placard clockwise and have the player nominate a new Chancellor. If you tie or vote “Nein” 3 times in a row, then the top Policy of the stack is revealed and immediately placed on the matching board. Whenever the token reaches the end of the track, reset it to the bottom. If a majority of players vote “Ja!” , then the candidates become the President and Chancellor. If there are already 3 Fascist Policies enacted, ask the Chancellor if they are Hitler. The player must be honest and if they are Hitler, the Fascist team immediately wins. Otherwise, the game continues. When you’re on the Liberal team, try to slow down the vote and discuss since the Fascist team might try to rush to a decision."

[16] X Research source If the Chancellor enacts a Fascist Policy, it could mean the President or the Chancellor is on the Fascist team, but it may have been an unlucky draw. Remember you can lie and deceive the other players about why you made a decision. After 5 Fascist Policies have been enacted, the Chancellor can choose to veto the 2 Policy tiles they have to choose from. If the President agrees, the Policy tiles are discarded.
