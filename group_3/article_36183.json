      "content": "Apply an anti-aging gel, cream, or serum every day. There's an endless array of skincare products on the market, and each has a unique formulation and combination of active ingredients. Regardless of which product you choose, you'll get the best results if you apply it consistently, so be sure to incorporate your anti-aging products into your daily skincare routine. Anti-aging creams are typically thick, and they're especially effective at nourishing dry skin. [1] X Research source Gels are lighter than creams and they often have a silky feel. They absorb into the skin more quickly than creams, so they're a good option if you want to incorporate your anti-aging products into your morning routine. Serums tend to have a high concentration of the active ingredient, and they're good at penetrating deep into your skin. You may still want to use a cream or gel moisturizer after your anti-aging serum if your skin feels dry, but just use a plain moisturizer without anti-aging ingredients. [2] X Research source"

You may also notice mild side effects like dry skin, itching, redness, or burning, which may go away after a few weeks. https://www.self.com/story/retinization-period However, if they persist, try using a different formula, like a moisturizer containing retinol or retinaldehyde, which tend to be less irritating.

      "content": "Smooth your skin with alpha hydroxy acids. Alpha hydroxy acids (AHAs), like glycolic and lactic acid, and beta hydroxy acids (BHAs), like salicylic acid, gently exfoliate your skin. In addition, they might have a slight plumping effect, which can decrease the appearance of wrinkles and lines. [7] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source You can often find these ingredients in chemical exfoliants. Start by only applying them once a week or so, since they might make your skin extra sensitive. Your skin will likely look more smooth and plump right away, although the effects may only be temporary.

Just tap or smooth it into place and wait for it to dry according to the label instructions. The effects will be gone once you wash your face, but you should see results right away, so this is a good option if you just want to look fresh-faced in a hurry. You can apply makeup right over the wrinkle filler, if you'd likeâ€”the silicone will work as a primer. Although most wrinkle fillers won't have any long-term effects on your skin, some do contain exfoliants that can gradually help smooth out your wrinkles. These are typically marketed as wrinkle fillers, although you may get a similar effect by using a silicone-based makeup primer."

[23] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Botox is especially effective when it's used to treat wrinkles around the eyes and in the center of the forehead. Botox should only be administered by a licensed medical professional. In addition to the visible effects you'll get during the 3-4 months the Botox is active, your wrinkles might actually start to go away in the long run.
