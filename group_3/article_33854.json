      "title": "Start by expressing gratitude and appreciation.",
      "content": "Start by expressing gratitude and appreciation. Thanking God at the beginning of your prayer for the sick – or any prayer, period – is key. Your goal is not just to make a one-off request, but to establish a relationship and rapport with your Heavenly Father that will support you in your struggles. Woodford suggests thanking God for the things we tend to take for granted, like the nature around us, our food, and everything that keeps us alive “without us having to do anything.”"

      "title": "Appeal to God for healing instead of demanding.",
      "content": "Appeal to God for healing instead of demanding. Imagine how you feel when someone comes to you and demands something from you instead of asking nicely for it. God feels the same way when you demand things of Him, even if it’s an important request like healing a sick person. Instead, Woodford instructs, approach your request with humility and appeal to God’s unfailing kindness and mercy. Woodford recommends allowing yourself to be vulnerable when you pray to God to heal you or someone else. Feel free to use the same words you would say in a conversation with a good friend, like, “I'm really needing help here,” or “I'm really feeling out of sorts.” Speak to God from where you are and admit you can’t handle what life has thrown at you, especially if it’s a health-related issue. While God doesn’t respond well to demands, He always responds to honesty."

      "title": "Praise God for answering (even if it’s not the answer you want).",
      "content": "Praise God for answering (even if it’s not the answer you want). Woodford says that God always answers your prayers, but you may not always like the way He chooses to do so. Nevertheless, even if things don’t turn out the way you want them to – maybe your friend doesn’t get better, or maybe your child takes longer to recover from an injury – know that God is listening and verbally praise Him for his attentiveness. Acknowledge that God answers prayers by saying, “Thank you, Lord, for listening to my cries for help,” or “I love how I can turn to you for all my needs.”"

      "title": "End by affirming you accept God’s will.",
      "content": "End by affirming you accept God’s will. When your prayers don’t get answered, your faith may be shaken to the core. Trust that God, in His omniscience, knows what’s best. This will bolster your relationship with Him and grant you a sense of peace over all the things you can’t control. A classic way to affirm God’s will in prayer is by speaking the phrase, “May your will be done.” You can also ask God to help you accept the outcome of what you’re praying for, no matter if you perceive it as positive or negative. For example, if you’re requesting that He relieve someone in pain, ask, “Please help me trust your wisdom and accept your judgments.”"
