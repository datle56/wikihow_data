      "content": "Familiarize yourself with gift tax law. Any method of paying for someone else’s mortgage would qualify as a gift. In the United States, if you give someone a certain amount of money without receiving a service in return, you become liable for the gift tax. The gift tax is the U.S. government’s way of preventing people from avoiding income taxes by giving away all of their money. The gift tax kicks in once your annual monetary gifts exceed a certain value. The gift tax rate mirrors your individual income tax rate, so it can be as high as 40 percent. As of 2014, an individual can give up to $14,000 in gifts each year to any number of individuals without being liable for a gift tax. That means if you have three children and you want to give them money, you can give them each $14,000 per year without having to pay any gift tax. A couple can give up to $28,000 per year to any number of individuals without paying federal gift taxes. That means a couple can give $28,000 per year to each of their children without having to pay any gift tax. For example, a father and mother could give a child and their spouse $56,000 every year ($28,000 to two individuals). As of 2014, the lifetime cap on gift tax exemptions is set at $5.34 million. If, for example, you give $14,000 annually in gifts to multiple individuals, you will not be liable for an annual gift tax, but you will eventually surpass this lifetime limit for gift exemptions and become liable for any additional gifted income over $5.34 million. Taxed gifts do not count toward this lifetime cap. As of 2014, Connecticut is the only state to levy a state gift tax. [1] X Research source Other states have enacted gift taxes, but most have been repealed in recent years. [2] X Research source These gift tax exemptions are subject to yearly change. Consult your tax preparer to see how to report your gifts on your tax returns."

However, if you need to pay the mortgage off over a long period of time and don’t want it to be in the original owner’s name anymore, assuming the mortgage is the only way to do it. Creditors do not particularly care who pays the bill. The process of making a direct payment as a third party is no different than that of paying your own mortgage. However, some additional steps will be necessary if you want to remain anonymous. Whoever pays the mortgage receives the tax deduction for mortgage interest. The homeowner will no longer be able to claim deductions for payments that you made, but you will."

Similarly, you can find the bank’s phone number and pay the bill by phone. Find the bank’s address to mail a check. Send a check or cashier’s check. Mail the check via certified mail to confirm receipt. Make sure that you write down the name and address of the debtor and their account number in the memo section of the check so that the bank knows which mortgage you are paying.

Many mortgage contracts include a “due on sale” clause that requires the entire sum of the mortgage to be paid shortly after it is transferred. However, some lenders will be willing to make exceptions for qualified applicants with good credit. Also, some types of loans can always be assumed. [11] X Research source Even when there is a due on sale clause, you can still assume a mortgage if: you are assuming your parents’ mortgage, transferring the property to a relative after the death of the borrower, transferring the property between spouses, or transferring it according to the terms of a divorce. [12] X Research source FHA and VA loans are always assumable. If there is a due on sale clause in the mortgage, but the lender is fine with you assuming it, they might still change the terms of the mortgage, possibly increasing the interest rate.

Assuming a mortgage may allow you to get lower interest rates than are currently available and to avoid large closing costs. There is no general rule as to which option will be better, however, because interest rates are currently higher than they were in recent years, it is quite likely that assumable mortgage will have rates much lower that you could currently find. The drawback to assumable mortgages is that often the original borrower will still be liable for the mortgage. If the mortgage is not paid it can affect their credit score. Try to get a written release of liability from the lender and keep it for your records. [14] X Research source"
