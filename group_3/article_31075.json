      "title": "Jump in once the mosh pit opens up.",
      "content": "Jump in once the mosh pit opens up. Mosh pits usually form front and center of the concert crowd, so wait in that general area for the mosh pit to start. Don’t do any moshing until it’s clear that the mosh pit has started. You’ll know it’s getting ready to rumble when the performer announces it or other concertgoers begin to make a circular-ish clearing near the stage. [1] X Research source Not everyone wants to mosh, and those who do will be in the pit. Moshing before the pit opens or away from the pit could get someone hurt."

      "title": "Take only what you need, and strap everything down.",
      "content": "Take only what you need, and strap everything down. Mosh pits are kinetic, and any loose objects can and will get thrown around. To avoid losing your things or accidentally throwing them into another concertgoer’s face, leave them with a friend. Or, place them in your bag and make sure everything’s zipped, strapped, and secure. [2] X Research source Leave your open drinks with a friend, too. Glass bottles or sticky liquids are a no-go in the pit."

      "title": "Start at the sides and work your way in for a more intense experience.",
      "content": "Start at the sides and work your way in for a more intense experience. The edges of the pit are the most tame, but be aware that people on the border might push you a bit further in. Stay on the outside of the circle until you get your bearings. Then, when you’re ready, venture further into the center to get really wild. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Dance classic mosh moves, or just move your body how you like.",
      "content": "Dance classic mosh moves, or just move your body how you like. The pit is all about getting loose and going all-out, but try some go-to hardcore moves if you’re not sure how to start moving. Jump up and down to get warmed up (a.k.a. the “Po-Go”), run around the pit in a circle to whip up a whirlwind, or spin your arms in controlled circles to execute the iconic “windmill.” Try some other classic moves, too: [4] X Research source Skanking: Run in place and punch the air. It’s an easy dance that you’ll see in pretty much every mosh pit. The Push: Pinball around the pit and give anyone you collide with a careful but impactful shove. Don’t hurt anyone, though! Wrecking: Find another mosher and take turns giving each other firm, but not painful, punches to the chest in time with the music. Wall of Death: This one started in some unsavory circles, but it's been adopted by many a mosher. Moshers line up on opposite sides of the pit, then charge forward. Keep your arms up to protect your head, and roll off anyone you collide with."

      "title": "Stop and help any fallen moshers ASAP.",
      "content": "Stop and help any fallen moshers ASAP. If you notice someone on the ground, stop moshing and help them stand up so they don’t get trampled. If they’re hurt, help them to the edge of the pit. Do a quick check-in to see if they’re alright, and get them to security or a paramedic if they seem dazed or disoriented. [5] X Research source While most moshers are conscientious and helpful, keep in mind that, in some respects, it’s everyone for themselves in the pit. Be someone’s mosh pit angel if they’re down, but don’t expect an angel to always be there for you."

      "title": "Don’t throw things into or out of the pit.",
      "content": "Don’t throw things into or out of the pit. If we’re being real, it’s probably gonna happen. A stray water bottle or a half-full can might soar into the circle. But mind your own manners and refrain from sending anything flying, if you can help it. If something does fly your way, slide it to the outside of the pit—don’t huck it back. [6] X Research source If you find stray items on the ground, move to the outside of the pit and hold it over your head so the owner can spot it and come retrieve it."

      "title": "Don’t try to mosh with people that aren’t in the pit.",
      "content": "Don’t try to mosh with people that aren’t in the pit. Some people at the show just want to stand and enjoy the music. Don’t pull in people from outside of the pit or continue to mosh after you exit. What happens in the pit stays in the pit. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Help crowd surfers when you see them. Crowd surfing can happen when you least expect it. If a surfer comes your way, help move them along. It’s a time-honored tradition that brings you closer to other concertgoers, and surfers need your (literal) support to make it across the crowd safely. [8] X Research source"

      "title": "Respect your fellow moshers.",
      "content": "Respect your fellow moshers. The pit is a volatile place—hands and elbows everywhere you look. Go with the vibe of the pit—keep your movement controlled and tame if that’s what’s already going on. And remember, it’s not a fighting ring. If you get hit, know that it’s probably not personal. Brush it off and either ditch the pit or get back out there! This isn’t the place for grudges. [9] X Research source Keep your arms up near your face and your head down to avoid any serious injuries."

      "title": "Respect the venue staff.",
      "content": "Respect the venue staff. Sometimes security or other staff from the venue will enter the pit to help keep things under control. Staff and security are your allies! If they jump in to break up a fight or tame an out-of-hand mosh, listen to their instructions, and don’t try to mosh with them. That’s a 1-way ticket outta the venue. [10] X Research source"

      "title": "Wear clothes you don’t don’t mind getting ruined.",
      "content": "Wear clothes you don’t don’t mind getting ruined. Wear old, worn clothes or a cheap outfit you don’t feel attached to. Clothing can get easily ripped or stained in a mosh pit, so don’t wear your favorite shirt or new white kicks. [11] X Research source While you prep for the concert , ask yourself: Would I mind losing this forever? If the answer is yes, it’s best to leave it at home."

      "title": "Wear contact lenses instead of glasses, if possible.",
      "content": "Wear contact lenses instead of glasses, if possible. If you don’t have contact lenses, ask a friend that’s not going into the pit to hold your glasses for you while you mosh—but only if you’ll still be able to see. It’s easy for a pair of glasses to fall off in a mosh pit, and you might not get them back in one piece. [12] X Research source If you don’t have contacts and can’t see without your glasses, it’s best to stay out of the pit, for your own safety and the safety of others."

      "title": "Avoid wearing loose jewelry or accessories.",
      "content": "Avoid wearing loose jewelry or accessories. Just like with glasses, your loose jewelry and accessories could fall off and disappear in the mosh pit. Leave these items at home or ask a friend not going in the pit to hold onto them for you. [13] X Research source This goes double for dangly earrings or other piercing jewelry. Take them out, or swap them with smaller, more low-key jewelry."

      "title": "Wear snug, secure shoes, and don’t forget to tie them.",
      "content": "Wear snug, secure shoes, and don’t forget to tie them. Opt for sneakers or similar footwear over heels or hard-bottomed shoes. If your shoes could double as a weapon, the pit’s just not the place for them. [14] X Research source And double check your laces before you go into the mosh pit; you don't want to fall on your face because somebody stepped on your untied laces."
