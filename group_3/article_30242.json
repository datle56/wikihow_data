[1] X Research source Dig down until you find bedrock (an unbreakable grey block), then count 5-12 blocks above it. Mine the diamonds with an iron, diamond, or netherite pickaxe. Remember, never dig straight down. A \"staircase\" mine keeps you safe from pits and lava. You'll need two diamonds to make an enchantment table. [2] X Research source You'll also need a diamond pickaxe to mine obsidian (of which you need 4 for an enchantment table), which requires three more diamonds. Stick to layers 11 and 12 to avoid most of the lava."

Scoop up lava with one bucket and pour it into a four-block pit. Pour the water from a higher structure so it flows down onto the lava. The lava should become obsidian."

Alternatively, craft them yourself: Kill cows or horses until you get at least one leather. Cut down three sugar cane reeds. Craft three sugar cane into paper. (Place the three reeds in one row.) Since sugarcane is hard to find, start a sugarcane farm. Combine one leather and three paper to make a book. (Place them anywhere in the crafting area, with the paper in separate squares.)"

You can place armor, swords, bows, books, or most tools in the enchantment table. This goes in the left slot in PC edition, and the top slot in Pocket Edition. Books store enchantments for later use with an anvil . Enchanting tools directly is more efficient. Some enchantments can only be applied to an item through enchanted books and not through enchantment tables. [4] X Research source You can acquire enchanted books by trading with librarian villagers.

You must be at least this level to choose that option. It does not change the amount of experience it costs."
