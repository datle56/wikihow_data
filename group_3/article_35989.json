The pressure from squeezing the muscles will help increase blood flow to the area, which in turn will help loosen up the muscles. Squeezing can also provide some temporary pain relief. Alternatively, you can try progressive muscle relaxation , which involves tensing and releasing individual muscles throughout your body."
