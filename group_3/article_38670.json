      "content": "Know what a transfer agent is. Publicly traded companies use transfer agents to manage individuals and organizations who own shares of their stock. Usually, the transfer agent is a bank or trust company. Sometimes a very large company, like Walt Disney, acts as its own transfer agent. Transfer agents perform three main functions: issuing and canceling stock certificates; acting as an intermediary for the company to pay out interest and stock dividends; and handling lost or destroyed stock certificates.

      "content": "Transfer the stock to direct registration. Call the transfer agent and ask for instructions on how to transfer the stock to direct registration. The Direct Registration System (DRS) allows owners of stock certificates to hold their shares in book entry-form with the transfer agent instead of as a physical stock certificate. Book-entry means that the transfer agent keeps a record of your ownership of the stock in its books. This replaces the physical stock certificate. Once you have done this, you can easily sell the stock at any time. DRS protects you from fraud and other risks associated with paper certificates. It also saves you money because it eliminates the cost of storing, printing and insuring paper certificates. You will have to mail the stock certificates to the transfer agent. Send them via insured mail with tracking information."

However, if you do not already have an account with that broker, they will likely charge you a hefty fee. In the past, brokerage firms have offered to sell paper stock certificates for free or at low cost in the hopes that customers would then open an account and use their other services. However, most customers did not go on to open accounts with the brokers, so most brokerage firms stopped offering this service."

This will replace your paper stock certificate. The brokerage firm will send you quarterly statements that list your securities, dividends and interest statements.

Find the spot that says, “Constitute and appoint ________ attorney to transfer.” Write the name of the brokerage firm on the line.

This is a stamp that guarantees your signature so the brokerage firm knows that it was actually you who signed the certificate over to them. The witness at the bank will stamp the back of your certificate with the medallion signature guarantee. Write your social security number and account number on the front of the certificate."

When someone buys shares of stock in a company, they can receive a stock certificate that states how many shares they own, the date the stock was sold, identification numbers, a corporate seal and relevant signatures. A stock certificate is usually printed on a large piece of paper and features elaborate graphic designs that are intended to prevent fraudulent replication. In the past, stock certificates were issued any time someone purchased stock in a company. Today, however, the records of stock ownership are generally kept in electronic form. You can request a paper stock certificate. Companies will usually charge a fee for printing it for you. [11] X Research source A physical stock certificate is also referred to as “bearer form,” meaning the bearer of the certificate owns the securities. [12] X Research source"
