      "content": "Know what a GM (game master) emulator is. A GM emulator (also called an oracle) is the main tool you will use during your solo roleplaying sessions to answer yes or no questions and spur your creativity. Usually, GM emulators generate random events to answer your questions and sprinkle the unexpected into your game. Some popular oracles are Mythic 2E and MUNE. [1] X Research source Although they come in various forms, the core structure of these emulators revolves around propelling the narrative forward. For example, if you were playing a solo fantasy game and you came upon a new town, you might ask, \"Does this town have a tavern?\" In this case, roll the dice and look at what the oracle table says to see the answer. For questions that could potentially have an infinite number of answers, an oracle will usually have tables with words or themes on them to aid your creative process. Often, a GM emulator will help you assess how likely you are to succeed in a certain action, and adjust the thresholds for \"yes\" and \"no\" answers accordingly. For example, you may be trying to sneak past some castle guards. Since the guards are distracted, you assess the chances of successfully sneaking past as \"very likely.\" In a scenario with this probability, the GM emulator sets out that you need a d100 roll of 10-100 to succeed. In a \"very unlikely\" scenario, you may need a d100 roll of 90-100."

      "title": "Know the different types of solo games.",
      "content": "Know the different types of solo games. The two main types are journaling games and emulator games. Journaling games are usually more structured and have the player write or draw a response to a prompt. The prompts become more complex as you go along to draw you deeper into the storyline. Rather than playing with a Game Master, you can let your imagination drive the storyline forward. If you're looking to build a narrative powered by your stream of consciousness, or wish to take a single character on a dramatic journey, journaling games will allow you to do so. [2] X Research source Emulator games have you act as your own game master for your solo game. They tend to be more open-ended, with a less rigid scene structure. A GM emulator is typically required to play them, but often they will have one built into the rules. These games are ideal if you want to introduce spontaneity, or wish to explore a world with more flexibility."

      "title": "Know how to use random tables.",
      "content": "Know how to use random tables. Most random tables only require you to roll one or more dice, check the result, and then check the correct line on the table for your answer. [3] X Research source For example, if you were playing a science fiction RPG and were flying through space, you could roll a d100, get a 55, check a Random Space Encounter Table, and see \"Gang of Vicious Space Pirates\" on row 55 of the table. Oh no! Most oracles use random tables as the main method of answering questions. You might use random tables to come up with names, details about a town, or even an entire adventure! There are some trickier tables, like the triangular tables used in the \"Secrets of Cats\" supplement for the RPG Fate Core. In those cases, check the instructions for the table to see how to use it."

      "content": "Collect your oracle and some useful random tables. If you are playing an RPG designed for solo play, it might already have oracles and random tables for you to use. If not, it's a good idea to find some. There's a bounty of random tables on the internet, particularly for the fantasy genre. Print some of these out and you might just be ready to play! A minimal starter oracle for beginners is the d6 oracle. When you have a question, roll a d6. A 6 is a \"Yes, and\" result. A 5 is a \"Yes\" result. A 4 is a \"Yes, but\" result, a 3 is a \"No, but\" result, and so forth. The \"ands\" and \"buts\" represent positive and negative complications, respectively. [4] X Research source"

Although some role-playing games are designed specifically to be played without a game master, an oracle will allow you to play practically any game you want. [5] X Research source Some RPGs may fit the solo playstyle better than others, however. Do some research before committing to playing a RPG solo, to see if it has worked out for other people. There may also be game-specific advice that's worth a read if your RPG isn't specifically designed to be played without a game master."

      "content": "Get a notebook for writing down what happens during your sessions (optional). Some people use solo RPG gameplay to inspire prose, while others just like to write bullets of key things that happen in each scene. However you like to play, a notebook can be a very useful tool for recording the storyline while soloing. [6] X Research source Some people prefer to use an audio or video log. This is a particularly good method if you want to share your sessions on social media or as a podcast."

      "content": "Come up with a world to play in. Every RPG needs a field of play, the place where the adventure will unfold. Solo RPGs are no exception. Take a few minutes to write down the details of the world you will be playing in. Major geographical features, social hierarchies, fictional organizations and the tone of the adventure itself may need to be set out before embarking upon your solo adventure. Don't create too much of your world up front: you will discover the specifics as you go, using your oracle questions and random tables to guide you. This way, you can also build your own side plots and alliances along the way. Of course, you can always use your RPG's default setting, if it has one. Supplements designed to expand upon the core game, such as pre-written campaigns or rule expansions, also work in allowing you to explore different elements of a pre-constructed setting."

      "content": "Fill out a character sheet if your RPG requires it. This should be the last thing you do, as ideally, your character should be an integrated part of the world you already created. Make sure you are familiar with the particular game's process of character customization. This may involve choosing a \"class\" of magical abilities from a list, as well as specifying inventory items, profession, and moral alignment. While playing solo, you must be confident in your character's motivations and personality traits to craft a storyline you can immerse yourself in. Give your character some kind of goal before you start soloing. There's nothing worse than aimlessly sitting in your chair because you don't know what your character should do next! Remember, you are in charge of your solo play experience. You have a lot more character creation freedom than you might have in group play. Go ahead, play a villain who likes to destroy entire planets for sport! Use that badly-balanced Reddit homebrew your usual GM would never let you! Nobody can stop you."

      "content": "Start playing the RPG. This might seem a little unhelpful, but this is exactly what you need to do! Start narrating to yourself as if you were acting as the game master for someone else. The hardest part of the process is getting past the initial strangeness of playing solo. RPG storylines are supposed to immerse the player in an entirely alternate, exciting world. To experience the magic the game is intended to provide, leave your fears of getting started behind and decide what your character should do next. If you have any questions about the state of your game, consult your oracle of choice or use your random tables. Start the game off with a scenario that demands drastic action from your character. Doing so will force you to make a decision in which your character's underlying motives and principles become clear. By the end of the scene, you will \"know\" your character better and be left with many questions to help drive your world expansion. [7] X Research source"

Maybe you asked the oracle too many or too few questions, or maybe you felt that the game was too slow. Whatever you find in your reflections, keep them in mind for your next session. You don't have to finish your existing adventure before starting a new one. If your existing campaign isn't working out for you, try a new one!"
