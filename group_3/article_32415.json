      "content": "Blue is the dominant passport color in the Americas and some Asian countries. Blue passports have become associated with the “New World” and its political connotations, as well as a symbol of the contemporary world led by the United States’ influence. In South America, blue is also the color of choice for the regional economic bloc Mercosur ( Mercado Común del Su r or the Southern Common Market). Some Middle Eastern and Asian countries also have blue passports, but share few economic or cultural ties with the Americas.

      "content": "Most of the EU and some nations with communist history have red passports. All European Union (EU) nations except Croatia have burgundy passports, as do other countries hoping to join or work closely with the Union, like Albania or Türkiye. One semi-exception is Switzerland, which uses a bright red passport to reflect its flag. Red is also historically associated with communist ideals, and countries with ties to communism or that uphold socialist communist ideals, like China or the Russian Federation, have incorporated red into their passport cover designs. Red is also tied to Christianity and the Viking history of the Nordic nations.

      "content": "Countries choose passport colors based on cultural, political, or religious factors. The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) provides recommendations on passport size, legibility, and font for ease of travel, but there is no universal guideline or authority that dictates what color a country’s passport should be—each nation is free to choose for themselves. When choosing a color, governments consider factors including: [9] X Research source Political and economic ties. Member states of blocs like the EU, ECOWAS, and Mercosur share the same passport color, with some exceptions. Religious or historical factors. Green is an important color in Islam, reflected in their passport color. Red is also associated with Christianity and historically communist nations. Cultural significance. Some nations, like New Zealand, incorporate their national color into their passport design (in this case, black). Regional ties. Neighboring nations tend to adopt the same passport color. For example, most North and South American nations are blue, European countries are red, and many West African nations are green."

Gray (service) passports are given on a limited basis to third-party contractors traveling to support the US government whose travel cannot be accomplished using a regular passport."

      "title": "The US tourist passport hasn’t always been blue.",
      "content": "The US tourist passport hasn’t always been blue. In fact, the earliest US passports were simply letters or pieces of paper that could be issued by states, cities, notaries public, or the Department of State. In 1856, the Department of State became the sole issuer of US passports, but they often weren’t required to travel abroad except in times of war until 1920, when the aftermath of WWI made international travel a security risk and many European nations required them for entry. [11] X Research source These paper passports weren’t meant to be durable. They were generally only valid for a single trip or for a few months, depending on when and why you got one. After WWI, the US began issuing passports with cardboard covers to make them more durable for international travel. The League of Nations standardized passport size, format, and layout throughout the 1920s. The US followed suit and eventually adopted a 28-page booklet with a green cover. In 1970, the passport color was changed to blue to celebrate the US’ bicentennial. [12] X Research source In 1993, the passport was changed back to green to celebrate the bicentennial of the US Consular Service. In 1994 (just 1 year later), the passport was changed back to blue and has stayed blue ever since."

      "content": "The most powerful passport is from the United Arab Emirates (UAE). The Passport Index ranks passports by their mobility score. Mobility scores are calculated by subtracting the number of nations that require a visa for entry from certain passport holders from the total number of nations with passports (198). The UAE has a mobility score of 179, meaning only 19 nations require UAE passport-holders to have a visa for entry. [14] X Research source The least powerful passport is from Afghanistan, with a mobility score of 40. The US is ranked 8th with a mobility score of 170 (along with Cyprus and the United Kingdom). A passport’s color does not reflect its power. For example, both the UAE and Afghanistan have blue passports. However, a majority of passports in the top spots are red.
