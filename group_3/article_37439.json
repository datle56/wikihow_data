Like politics, painting requires skill, a vision, decisive action, and patience. For him, it was a way to get similar rewards to politics, but without the frustration and high stakes.

If you’re stressing about making it through the work day and don’t have time to fully step away and recharge, there are plenty of ways to give yourself an energy boost and rest for a moment before diving into the next meeting or task. Take a look at some of these possibilities: [23] X Research source Pause for 30 seconds or a minute on your lunch break before you start eating. Simply sit with your food and take a moment to breathe. When you’re stressed, take a few deep breaths and pay special attention to the “pause” at the end of your inhale before you exhale to “reset” your focus. When you finish a task (no matter how small), take a break for a few seconds or a minute to do a mini-recharge before moving on to the next one. Take 1 minute (at your desk, walking around the office, looking out a window, or wherever you can find some space and quiet) to take a full mental break. Close your eyes, do some deep breathing, or just let your mind wander. Leave your work at work when you clock out—no emails, no calls, no extra tasks until you clock back in.

Resting well and with purpose when you need a break is key to performing and feeling your best when you need to be “on.” So, try changing your mindset around rest: taking a break doesn’t mean you’ve failed or unproductive. It just means that whatever you didn’t get to today, you’ll get to tomorrow. [24] X Research source Here are some more ways to improve your rest and make it more purposeful: Accept that it’s not always possible to cross every single item off your to-do list by the time you want to. Think something like “I didn’t expect this, but I accept that I need a break” to realistically gauge your expectations. Ask yourself if you’re truly at rest while resting. Are you truly relaxed and mindful of your senses and surroundings, or is your mind racing instead of just being ? Take a few breaths and try to quiet your mind. Focus on your surroundings to connect to the “now.” Think about what you see, feel, smell, hear, or taste right now to calm your mind and engage your senses. Do what feels good and restful to you. Everybody’s needs and motivations are different, so adjust restful activities to suit your preferences or schedule."

But, to feel fully recharged, it’s important to rest yourself in other areas, too. The 7 types of rest are: [25] X Research source Physical rest: Recovering from activities that fatigue your body. Ways to rest include sleep, naps, or light physical activity. Mental rest: Quieting your mind and soothing racing thoughts. Ways to rest include journaling, taking breaks from work, or meditation. Sensory rest: Limiting overstimulation to ground yourself. Ways to rest include cutting down on screen time and focusing on one sense at a time to ground yourself. Emotional rest: Being authentic and allowing your emotions to be felt. Ways to rest include expressing your real feelings or surrounding yourself with people who give you emotional peace. Social rest: Balancing alone time with your capacity for socialization. Ways to relax include recognizing when your “social battery” is drained and setting boundaries to protect your social energy. Creative rest: Getting inspired and releasing the pressure to do or make something. Ways to rest include taking breaks from problems or projects, going for walks to let your thoughts flow, or engaging with content or activities that inspire you. Spiritual rest: Connecting with something larger or deeper than yourself. Ways to rest include prayer, meditation, engaging with your community, or pursuing your deepest passions ."

For many who link their self-esteem to their productivity, resting feels like quitting, being lazy, or being unproductive when there’s more work to do and success to gain. On the other hand, some people don’t want to deal with racing thoughts, boredom, or negative feelings like anger or loneliness and prefer to stay distracted or keep pushing themselves to work. [27] X Research source Other potential reasons people struggle to rest could include: Perfectionistic tendencies that push you to accomplish everything flawlessly and a fear that a break will undermine your success.

It’s easy to visualize how rest benefits you physically; things like sleep, naps, or a “rest day” between workouts are common ways people take care of their bodies in order to function at a sharper level later. However, your brain, creativity, and motivation also benefit from quality rest: [28] X Research source Proper rest allows your brain to retain information more easily and form stable, long-lasting memories. Allowing your mind to wander “unsticks” you from time so you can process the past and make plans for the future (consciously or subconsciously). Having downtime makes you feel more motivated, attentive, productive, and creative when it’s time to get back to work. Wakeful rest (scientifically called the “default mode network” of your brain) allows you to subconsciously solve problems, giving you those “aha!” moments of realization (this is especially true for highly creative people). Some evidence even suggests resting moments allow you to check in with your feelings and morals, leading to a firmer sense of self."
