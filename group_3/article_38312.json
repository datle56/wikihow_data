      "content": "This creepy creature lives near the seafloor in the deep ocean, where it can grow up to 4 ft (1.2 m) in length. Females have a bioluminescent appendage that they use like a lure—the light attracts prey in the dark recesses of the deep sea, and when it gets close enough, the anglerfish eats it. [1] X Research source What makes it so scary? The deep-sea anglerfish has a jutting bottom jaw, and with its squat body, it sort of looks like a swimming mouth full of razor-sharp teeth—with a fishing pole attached. It’s the stuff of nightmares. Bonus creepy fact: Male anglerfish are tiny, and they live as parasites on a female’s body."

      "content": "The Australian box jellyfish is huge—its body can reach up to 1 ft (0.30 m) in diameter and its thick tentacles can be up to 10 ft (3.0 m) long. Living in the warm waters off the coast of northern Australia, this box jellyfish is considered to be the most venomous of any sea creature. [2] X Research source What makes it so scary? Within minutes, an Australian box jellyfish sting can paralyze you and stop your heart. They also have clusters of eyes, so they’re able to see and hunt their prey."

      "content": "Fast and agile with two rows of teeth, the barracuda is a skilled hunter. It typically lives in warmer waters near reefs or mangroves. Barracudas can be found in the Atlantic Ocean, Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico, Red Sea, and Indo-Pacific. [3] X Research source What makes it so scary? Barracudas are ambush predators, and they can swim in bursts of up to 35 mph (56 km/h). They’re also curious and attracted to shiny objects, which sometimes leads to encounters with humans—and their sharp teeth can inflict a nasty bite."

      "content": "The barreleye is a deep-sea fish that lives in the Pacific Ocean and was first observed alive in the 1990s. These fish are tiny—only about 4 in (10 cm)—and feed mostly on zooplankton. Barreleyes have a transparent, fluid-filled section called a “cockpit” that allows you to see inside their heads. [4] X Research source What makes it so scary? Seeing a fish that looks like a living submarine is creepy enough, but being able to look straight at its brain and glowing green eyeballs is the stuff of nightmares. Bonus creepy fact: The barreleye is so strange that it’s earned the nickname “spookfish.”"

      "content": "The black dragonfish lives in subtropical waters at depths of about 6,600 ft (2,000 m), where they can reach lengths of up to 10 in (25 cm). [5] X Research source They’re ultra-black, which means that their skin absorbs 99.5% of light—the perfect deep-sea camouflage for hiding from predators and ambushing prey. [6] X Research source What makes it so scary? With its inky black skin, narrow body, and long, fanglike teeth, the black dragonfish looks like what you’d draw if you tried to come up with the scariest deep-sea creature imaginable. Bonus creepy fact: The eyes of the juvenile dragonfish dangle on a long stalk below its body. The stalks eventually retract as the fish matures."

      "content": "The black swallower lives in warmer waters at depths of up to 10,000 ft (3,000 m). It’s a slender fish before it eats, but it has an enormous mouth and an expanding stomach, so it’s capable of eating fish up to four times its size. [7] X Research source What makes it so scary? After the black swallower eats, it carries its massive meals in its balloon-like stomach, which can stretch so much that the skin becomes transparent. Its mouth and palate are lined with backwards-curving teeth to help hold its food in place. Bonus creepy fact: Sometimes the black swallower eats so much that it can’t digest its meal before the food decomposes, and the fatal gas buildup causes them to float to the surface."

      "content": "The blobfish lives in the waters around Australia at a depth of around 4,000 ft (1,200 m). It just looks like a regular fish when it’s in its natural deep-sea environment, but if it’s brought to the surface, the lack of pressure causes it to collapse into a weird gelatinous blob. [8] X Research source What makes it so scary? The blobfish is slimy, jiggly, and sort of looks like a grotesque cartoon of a grumpy old man. Its face will haunt you—in fact, it was named the “World’s Ugliest Animal” in 2013. A realistic image of the blobfish can be found here ."

      "content": "The Bobbit worm is a bristly reef-dweller that can grow up to an astounding 10 ft (3.0 m) long. It burrows down into the sand, leaving just its head sticking out, and when it senses prey with its antennae, it strikes, sometimes biting fish right in half. [9] X Research source Why is it so scary? If a massive, bristle-covered worm isn’t creepy enough as-is, the Bobbit worm also injects its prey with a toxin that makes it easier to digest."

This odd creature lives around 8,500 ft (2,600 m) below the surface, typically staying low, close to the seafloor. They feed on invertebrates like molluscs and crabs, and they can reach lengths of more than 6 ft (1.8 m). [12] X Research source What makes it so scary? The chimaera’s large eyes have a reflective layer that makes them look like they’re glowing in the dark. This gives them an eerie, ghost-like look as they glide along the bottom of the ocean. [13] X Research source Bonus creepy fact: Many chimaera have a venomous spine that they use to defend themselves."

During the day, they live at depths of around 3,000 ft (910 m), but they’re known to come to the surface at night to feed. [14] X Research source What makes it so scary? The cookie-cutter shark attaches itself to larger animals, then uses its serrated bottom teeth to scoop out a perfectly round bite of flesh. They’ve even been known to bite people on rare occasions."

Its jagged fins and giant teeth give it a fearsome appearance, but luckily this is a small fish—only about 6 in (15 cm). [15] X Research source What makes it so scary? One look at the fangtooth fish and you’ll see where it got its name—its teeth are so long that it had to evolve special pouches on its top palate just so it can close its mouth. In fact, out of all known sea creatures, the fangfish has the largest teeth in proportion to its body."

It can grow up to about 6 ft (1.8 m) and lives in deep water, where it hunts fish and squid. Frilled sharks can be found around the warm, from very cold to very warm waters. [16] X Research source What makes it so scary? The frilled shark has a primitive, eerie appearance, with a long, eel-like body, short snout and fins, and frilled gills. Its teeth are creepy, too—it has rows of 3-pronged, needle-sharp teeth on the top and bottom of its mouth."

[17] X Research source It’s believed that the colossal squid could be even larger, although because of their reclusive nature and deep-water environment, not enough is known about them to say for sure. [18] X Research source What makes them so scary? The giant and colossal squid have eyes the size of dinner plates, along with 8 arms, 2 feeding tentacles, a sharp beak, and a tongue that’s covered with teeth. They’re also thought to be highly intelligent, making them fearsome predators."

[19] X Research source They can grow up to 12 ft (3.7 m) long, and these slow-moving sharks mainly feed on fish, squid, and crustaceans. What makes it so scary? One look and it’s easy to see why the goblin shark regularly makes lists of the scariest sea creatures. It can push its jaws forward, causing its mouth to protrude from under its snout like a horrifying goblin. Bonus creepy fact: The goblin shark has a greyish-pinkish tint that gives it a frightful fleshy appearance."

They live in tropical and temperate waters around the world, and adults feed on prey like sea turtles, birds, and marine mammals. Thanks to the movie Jaws , this is one of the most well-known shark species in the world. [20] X Trustworthy Source National Geographic Website of the National Geographic Society Go to source What makes it so scary? These massive sharks are fast, traveling in bursts of up to 35 mph (56 km/h). Their mouths have up to 7 rows of teeth.

Its mouth resembles a pelican’s, which it can stretch and balloon to massive sizes to feed on large amounts of food. [21] X Research source What makes it so scary? The gulper eel's mouth can open to be about a quarter of its total body length—its wide, gaping jaws and black skin give it the terrifying look of a monster that can only come from the deep sea."

Sea spiders live around the world at depths of 7,000–13,000 ft (2,100–4,000 m), crawling along the sea floor in search of anemones, hybrids, and jellyfish.

[23] X Research source These scavengers mainly live in the northwestern Pacific Ocean at depths of around 660–1,800 ft (200–550 m). [24] X Research source What makes it so scary? It’s not actually a spider, but the Japanese spider crab’s eight spindly walking legs make it look enough like one to give us major nopes . Bonus creepy fact: The only thing scarier than a spider crab? A spider crab you can’t see. Younger crabs camouflage themselves by covering their shells with kelp. They do this to avoid predators, but we still think it’s sneaky."

      "content": "There are more than 60 species of sea snakes, which are relatives of the cobra. They’re highly venomous, and they typically live in shallower waters so they can hunt on the sea beds. They can stay underwater for hours and typically eat fish or fish eggs. [26] X Research source What makes it so scary? Venomous snakes that can swim and dive? A big no thank you. Luckily, sea snakes aren’t especially aggressive, and their short fangs mean they usually can’t deliver much venom if they do bite people. Still, count us terrified."

They’re masters of camouflage, spending hours on the sea floor, where they perfectly blend in with rocks and corals. Once something tasty swims by, they strike quickly, swallowing their dinner whole. [27] X Research source What makes it so scary? The stonefish is equipped with defensive venomous spines along its back. If you accidentally step on one—which is easy to do since they’re so hard to spot—the sting can lead to pain, swelling, and tissue death. In some cases, stonefish encounters are even fatal.

They’re such efficient parasites that after they invaded the Great Lakes, they destroyed the region’s one-vibrant trout fishing economy. [30] X Research source What makes it so scary? The sea lamprey’s round sucker mouth is ringed with barbed teeth. It looks like a nasty parasite, and just the sight of it is ick-inducing."

They’ll eat almost anything, even other lizardfish, and can grow up to 33 in (84 cm) long. [31] X Research source What makes it so scary? The lizardfish’s rows of protruding teeth and ambush hunting style make it one of the creepiest deep-sea predators. Luckily, its habitat means it’s not much of a threat to people, but it’s still pretty spooky."

They can grow to be up to 1 ft (0.30 m) long and look almost stereotypically like a deep-sea fish, with big dark eyes, jagged, needle-like teeth, and bioluminescence that helps it attract prey. [35] X Research source What makes it so scary? The Pacific viperfish has ultrablack skin and jagged fangs that are so long they sit outside the fish’s mouth.

First discovered in 1874, sightings are still uncommon—which is fortunate, because this faceless fish is seriously creepy. [36] X Research source What makes it so scary? The fish’s mouth and eyes are on the bottom of its body, so when you first look at it, it doesn’t appear to have a face at all—just a swimming fish body. [37] X Research source"
