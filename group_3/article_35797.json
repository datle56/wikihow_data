      "content": "Heat a skillet over medium-high heat for 2 minutes. Set the skillet on the stove and turn on the burner so the skillet is hot before you add the fries. For the crispiest fries, use a cast-iron skillet since it holds heat better than a nonstick skillet. [1] X Research source If you don't have a cast-iron skillet, use the heaviest skillet you have."

      "title": "Add 2 teaspoons (9.9 ml) of oil to the skillet and heat it for 20 seconds.",
      "content": "Add 2 teaspoons (9.9 ml) of oil to the skillet and heat it for 20 seconds. To prevent the oil from burning, use an oil with a high smoke point, such as vegetable, canola, or peanut oil. Give the oil a chance to heat up before you put the fries in the skillet. [2] X Research source If you're reheating more than a handful of fries, use an extra 1 to 2 teaspoons (4.9 to 9.9 ml) of oil."

      "content": "Scatter 1 cup (85 g) of french fries in the skillet. Try to arrange the fries so they're in a single layer, which will make them crispy on the sides. If you'd like to reheat more than a handful of fries, you may want to reheat them in batches so they aren't crowded in the skillet. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Cook the fries for 2 to 5 minutes and flip them halfway.",
      "content": "Cook the fries for 2 to 5 minutes and flip them halfway. Let the fries cook for about 1 to 2 minutes before you flip them over with a flat spatula. Then, heat the fries for another minute and flip them again so they're hot on every side. [4] X Research source If you're reheating skinny french fries, you'll probably only need to heat them for 2 to 3 minutes, while thick steak fries will take closer to 5 minutes."

      "title": "Transfer the fries to a paper towel-lined plate and serve them.",
      "content": "Transfer the fries to a paper towel-lined plate and serve them. Tear off 1 or 2 paper towels and lay them on a plate. Then, use a slotted spoon to move the fries from the skillet to the paper towels. Serve the fries right away while they're still crispy. [5] X Research source The paper towels will absorb excess grease from the fries."

      "content": "Preheat the oven to 450 °F (232 °C) and line a sheet with foil. Take a rimmed baking sheet and press a piece of aluminum foil across it. The foil will prevent the fries from sticking to the baking sheet. [6] X Research source It's important to use a rimmed baking sheet so the fries don't slide off the sheet as you're moving them to the oven."

The fries are finished reheating when they're completely hot and have a little crunch. [9] X Research source If the fry is still cold in the center, leave the fries in the oven for 1 minute and check them again. Keep in mind that it won't take the fries very long to heat up."

Then, stop the machine and take the basket out so you can shake the fries a little. Put the basket back and finish reheating the fries for 1 to 2 more minutes.

To microwave them, drizzle a little vegetable oil over the fries and spread them on a paper towel-lined plate. Microwave them for 20 seconds at a time until the fries are hot. [14] X Research source"
