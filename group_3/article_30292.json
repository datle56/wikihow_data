      "content": "Fold a square piece of paper in half both ways, unfolding it after each fold. First, fold the paper in half one way and unfold it. Then, fold it in half the other way and unfold it again. Make both of these folds mountain folds. A mountain fold is where the crease makes a peak on the top side of the paper. [1] X Research source When you’re finished, there should be 2 creases that intersect in the center of the paper. Origami paper will work the best for this, but you can use printer paper or any other kind of paper you have lying around too. Origami squares are usually 6 by 6 inches (15 cm × 15 cm). You can experiment with using bigger or larger squares, but they might be more difficult to fold."

      "content": "Crease the paper in half diagonally both ways, unfolding it after each fold. Start by folding the paper in half diagonally one way. Then, unfold it, and fold it in half diagonally the other way. Unfold the paper again. Make both of these folds valley folds. A valley fold is the opposite of a mountain fold. The crease of a valley fold should look like a valley instead of a peak. [2] X Research source At this point, there should be 4 creases that intersect at the center of the paper."

Once they're touching, flatten the model so you're left with a small square. [3] X Research source The square you're left with will be smaller than the square you started with."

Then, do the same thing with the right corner of the top flap. [5] X Research source Go over the creases a few times with your finger since the rest of the process will be easier if they're crisp."

Lift the bottom corner up toward the top like you did with the bottom corner on the other side of the model. Finish by folding all of the edges along the creases to flatten the model.
