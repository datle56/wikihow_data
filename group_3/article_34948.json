      "content": "Quiet quitting means only doing the minimum your job requires. Corporate workers are often expected to go the extra mile at their jobs by coming in early, staying late, and doing more work than they’re being compensated for. People who quiet quit reject this workplace culture and only perform the tasks they’re specifically getting paid to do. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "People quiet quit to reduce stress and work at their pay grade. It’s not that they don’t want to work for a living. It’s just that they want to have a living to enjoy and not join the 44% of US employees suffering from burnout. With our fast-paced, grueling corporate job culture, that’s not always possible.

      "title": "Employees quiet quit until they see improvement or find another job.",
      "content": "Employees quiet quit until they see improvement or find another job. Some companies take actionable steps to increase their employees’ satisfaction with their jobs, like raising their salaries or reducing their workloads. Others ignore the situation and wait for it to resolve itself. The “solution” is often the employee finding another job and resigning completely or staying due to a lack of options. [3] X Research source Quiet quitters who can’t find new jobs may fall into a new workplace attitude called resenteeism. Resenteeism, meaning “resentment” and “absenteeism,” is when employees quiet quit and want to leave their jobs, but can’t find a better position somewhere else. Not only are resenteeism workers doing the minimum at the job, but they’re also doing it with an attitude of resentment. This puts even more pressure on business owners and managers to address the quiet quitting issue."

      "content": "Stop doing any tasks that aren’t in your job description. If necessary, look at the description for your position and note the work you were hired to do. Then make a list of all the tasks you perform regularly and remove any of them that don’t match the description from your schedule."

      "title": "Stop showing up early to work and only arrive on time.",
      "content": "Stop showing up early to work and only arrive on time. Don’t walk into the office or clock in until the exact minute you’re supposed to start working. For example, if you’re supposed to start at 9 AM, stop starting your day at 8:30 AM or even 8:55 AM. That extra time is unpaid, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to work during it."

      "title": "Stop staying late in the office and leave on time.",
      "content": "Stop staying late in the office and leave on time. All those late nights you’ve spent at the office cramming for a presentation or laboring over a last-minute assignment from your boss end here. If you get off at 5 PM, that’s when you should leave. It doesn’t matter if you’re in the middle of a project. The hours after you’re supposed to clock out at work belong to you, not your boss."

      "title": "Don’t attend non-mandatory meetings or social work functions.",
      "content": "Don’t attend non-mandatory meetings or social work functions. These are often a waste of your time and can also take place outside of business hours. You must show your manager that you have a firm boundary between work and life, as well as a second boundary between what they want you to do and what they’re paying you to do. Life coach Maggie Mitchell offers this advice for people who struggle to maintain boundaries at work: “Letting people know that you have boundaries and aren’t a push over is key... Always be your own time keeper by setting limits and controlling your schedule. You may have to say yes, but you can control the how and when.”"

If you’re doing two or three times the amount of work you normally do or you’re being assigned tasks above your pay grade, but still getting paid the same low rate, that alone is reason enough to quiet quit.

      "content": "Bad work-life balance. If your manager constantly asks you to work overtime, take projects home with you, and answer their messages on your time off, that’s a bad work-life balance.

In that case, your only option is to work somewhere else. So fire up that resume and your LinkedIn profile and starting networking for your next big corporate adventure. You don’t have to jump right into working for another company. Try starting your own business or taking on a few side hustles. Be your own boss!"
