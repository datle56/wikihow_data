A bowler is considered to have a side on position when his or her back foot, chest, and hips are lined up toward to the batsman at back foot contact. While practicing in this position, start bowling at a slow to moderate pace, with your main goal being keeping the seam of your ball as straight as possible."

Seam bowling is a subcategory of fast bowling and capitalizes on the imperfections of a cricket ball to generate bounce, making the pitch more difficult to hit. Professional bowlers attain speeds up to 90 miles per hour. If you are just starting out learning seam bowling, aim for a moderate-paced pitch and focus on technique. Once you are confident in your seam technique, you can add more power to increase speed."
