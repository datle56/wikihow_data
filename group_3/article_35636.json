Ibuprofen prevents temperature increase and reduces the levels of \"prostaglandin\" hormones that cause the feeling of pain and cause inflammation. Acetaminophen reduces pain in the central nervous system and relieves fever, but does not reduce inflammation. Alternating between them may be more effective at reducing fever and body aches than choosing one or the other.

This type of muscle ache is often the result of trauma from a sports or exercise injury. Symptoms usually include pain and/or swelling of the injured area. You may have trouble moving the limb freely until the injury heals. These injuries are treated with the RICE method: Rest, Ice, Compress, and Elevate. [21] X Research source Rest the affected muscle as much as possible. Apply ice to the area to reduce swelling. The ice also numbs the nerve endings in the area, temporarily relieving pain. Apply ice packs for 15-20 minutes at a time. Compression both reduces swelling and helps stabilize the limb. This can be especially helpful if you injured your leg and are having trouble walking. Simply wrap the injured area snugly in an elastic bandage or trainer's tape. Elevating the affected area over your heart makes it harder to pump blood to it. This reduces swelling by relying on the force of gravity."
