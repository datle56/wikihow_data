      "title": "Get a letter-size (or A4) piece of paper.",
      "content": "Get a letter-size (or A4) piece of paper. You can also use a square 6” x 6” (15 cm x 15 cm) piece of origami paper . Thinner paper is preferable as thicker paper is harder to work with and doesn't always stay folded. [1] X Research source Avoid using small pieces of paper on your first try, as the folds will be more difficult to make and this may be frustrating. If you'd like to make a larger sized heart, use a larger piece of paper. If you decide to draw a design, split it in half; it will end up in the center of the heart. A decoration can be added when the heart is finished as well."

      "title": "Turn the paper to the side that is white.",
      "content": "Turn the paper to the side that is white. Then, fold the top right corner downwards so that it meets the left side of the paper. Unfold it, and do the same thing to the opposite corner; do not unfold. If you are using A4 paper as opposed to origami paper (which has a white side), don't worry about turning the paper to the side that is white."

      "title": "Fold the bottom part of the paper in half.",
      "content": "Fold the bottom part of the paper in half. Do this so that the white (or inside part of the paper) doesn't show anymore. Make sharp folds by sliding your nail over each fold. Neat, sharp folds will make your final product look better."

      "title": "Unfold the top part of the paper.",
      "content": "Unfold the top part of the paper. You should now have two diagonal creases on the paper."

      "title": "Turn the paper over again.",
      "content": "Turn the paper over again. Take the left and right sides of the paper (where the horizontal crease is) and pull them toward the center of the paper. As you pull them, the other two creases should be folding, too. Pull the two sides inwards so they touch. [2] X Research source It can take several tries to create the pyramid shape, especially if you are new to origami. You should end up with what looks like a triangle sitting on top of the rectangular portion at the bottom."

      "title": "Fold the bottom left corner of the top triangle so it meets the top point.",
      "content": "Fold the bottom left corner of the top triangle so it meets the top point. Only fold the top layer, not both layers of paper. Make the same fold on the other side; you should now have a diamond shape."

      "title": "Fold over the sides to meet the diamond.",
      "content": "Fold over the sides to meet the diamond. Grab the left side of the paper, and fold everything that's not part of the diamond you made in the previous step toward the center. Do the same for the other side."
