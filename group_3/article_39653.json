It’ll be hard for your child to spend time around you when they feel hurt or upset by you.

What was once seen as normal is now viewed as abusive, harmful or neglectful.

      "content": "They don’t accept you for who you are. A child will push back against the traits of the parents they resent. Whether it’s important aspects of your identity, your passions, or your distastes — your child wants to do the opposite. This means that their resentment casts a negative light on everything about you as an individual, and not just as their parent. Sometimes you also might not accept who your adult child has become. The best thing you can do is support your child as they figure out who they are, even if you don’t approve of their decisions.

To have a healthy conversation about difficult feelings like resentment, first ask your child to talk at a certain time/place. Set realistic expectations for the conversation, think deeply about your preconceived assumptions and accept that you may have made mistakes. [12] X Research source You can say, “Hey, I feel like your mood and interactions around me have changed recently.

Forgiveness is not just something we say, but it’s an internal process that forces you to shift your perception of a situation.

      "content": "Respect your child’s wishes if they want space. Sometimes adult children decide to be estranged from their parents. Avoid a reactive response to this information and instead stay calm. If they ask to go no-contact, respect their wishes because if you don’t, this may prolong the estrangement. When a child asks for estrangement, it is because something is wrong that you need to understand. [19] X Research source On average, estrangements last for 9 years. Most end in less than 5. But this will all depend on how you handle the situation and use the time apart productively. Work on yourself by going to therapy and listening to your emotions. You may feel lonely without your child, so it can help to join a club in order to build social support elsewhere."
