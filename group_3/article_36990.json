      "title": "Unscrew the main canister from the head of your grease gun.",
      "content": "Unscrew the main canister from the head of your grease gun. Rotate the grease gun’s base, which looks like a large cylindrical canister, counterclockwise. Continue twisting the canister until you’ve detached it from the head and nozzle of the gun. [2] X Research source The top portion of the grease gun is often referred to as the head."
    },
    {
      "title": "Pump the plunger to remove the empty cartridge.",
      "content": "Pump the plunger to remove the empty cartridge. Once the top of the gun is removed, extend and push in the plunger along the bottom of the tool. Watch as the empty cartridge is partially forced out of the grease gun, then use your hands to remove it completely. [3] X Research source If the empty cartridge has a lot of grease on it, use a paper towel when removing it."
    },
    {
      "title": "Extend the plunger from the back of the gun and secure it in place.",
      "content": "Extend the plunger from the back of the gun and secure it in place. Wrap your pointer and middle finger beneath the grease gun’s handle and pull upwards. Remove the plunger completely, then listen for a sound of air releasing, which means that it’s fully extended. [4] X Research source Some grease guns have a groove near the base of the plunger, which helps secure and lock the plunger into place. If your tool has this feature, push the plunger into the groove as an extra security measure."

    {
      "title": "Twist the cap off the bottom of the new cartridge.",
      "content": "Twist the cap off the bottom of the new cartridge. Examine your new cartridge of grease to find an end with a metal tab, as well as an end with a plastic cap. Rotate the plastic cap counterclockwise to remove it all the way. [5] X Research source The cartridge is always installed in the grease gun with the cap side down. You might need to apply a lot of force to twist off the cap completely."
    },
    {
      "title": "Slide the capless side of the cartridge into the canister.",
      "content": "Slide the capless side of the cartridge into the canister. Center the new cartridge over the top opening of the canister. Double-check that the section of the cartridge with the removed cap is facing downwards, then push the cartridge into the grease gun. Once the entire item is in the grease gun, press along the top to ensure that the cartridge is firmly installed in the tool. [6] X Research source The side with the metal tab needs to be facing upward."
    },
    {
      "title": "Remove and peel away the tab on the top side of the cartridge.",
      "content": "Remove and peel away the tab on the top side of the cartridge. Pretend you’re opening a can of soda or cat food, and remove the tab on the grease can in the same way. Once you’ve loosened and popped the tab, peel the metal lid off of the cartridge. If there’s a lot of grease stuck to the inner lid, be sure to scrape it into the open container of grease.

      "title": "Screw the head of the grease gun partially onto the canister.",
      "content": "Screw the head of the grease gun partially onto the canister. Take the top portion of the grease gun and arrange it on top of the canister. Use clockwise motions to twist the head partially back onto the gun. Don’t completely reattach it—instead, screw it about halfway onto the grease canister. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Push on the locked plunger to get rid of any air bubbles. While keeping the plunger locked in the groove, press on the handle to create tension in the base of the grease gun. The plunger itself won’t move, but you’ll be removing any leftover air bubbles from inside the gun."

Continue twisting until both parts of the grease gun are completely separated from one another. [10] X Research source With this style of grease gun, the grease will fill the canister itself instead of a separate cartridge."

      "title": "Rotate the bottom cap to remove it from the canister.",
      "content": "Rotate the bottom cap to remove it from the canister. Examine the canister to find a sturdy cap attached to the bottom of the tool. Twist counterclockwise to loosen the cap, which will make it easier to remove the piston and spring from the grease gun. [11] X Research source"

      "content": "Flip the rubber seal up so it covers the end of the piston. Find the metal circle along the edge of the rod, which has a black seal surrounding it. Use your fingers to push along the edges of the piston seal, creating a partition around the edge of the piston. By doing this, you create a secure seal for when the canister is filled with grease. [13] X Research source When the seal is turned downwards, the grease gun can hold a cartridge."

    {
      "title": "Reattach the cap to the central canister.",
      "content": "Reattach the cap to the central canister. Slowly push the piston back into the canister. Turn the cap clockwise to connect it to the central canister so there won’t be any grease leaks later on. At this point, check that the plunger is fully inserted in the back of the grease gun. [14] X Research source Make sure that you’re connecting the cap tightly and securely, or else air bubbles might form in the grease later."

      "title": "Dip the canister into a grease bucket and extend the back plunger.",
      "content": "Dip the canister into a grease bucket and extend the back plunger. Hold the canister in 1 hand while using your opposite hand to hold the base of the plunger. Place the tip of the canister about 2 in (5.1 cm) into an open bucket of grease, then pull slowly on the plunger. Extend the plunger to its full length to create a suction force, which sucks grease into the tool. [15] X Research source Try to pull on the plunger slowly."

Apply a slow, steady pressure to the plunger as you stick it back in the grease gun so the grease won’t have any air bubbles.
