      "title": "Get a plastic lid.",
      "content": "Get a plastic lid. You can make an STP device very easily at home, but you will need to practice using before you try it when you are out. To make a “coffee can lid” device you need to get hold of the plastic lid from a coffee can, or something similar, such as a lid from a yoghurt pot. These plastic lids are good choices because they are flexible enough to bend, and the plastic makes them easy to clean."

      "title": "Trim off the sides and lips of the lid.",
      "content": "Trim off the sides and lips of the lid. Once you have the lid, you will need to carefully cut off the edges and any lips around the edge of the lid. You want to trim the lid so that you are left with a smooth and flat disc. [1] X Research source Make sure the disc you are left with is still large enough for you to use effectively."

      "title": "Bend it into a funnel shape.",
      "content": "Bend it into a funnel shape. When you have your flat disc all you need to do is to roll it into a funnel shape. You will just need to pee into the funnel and the stream will come out of the narrow end. [2] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Purchase a medical spoon.",
      "content": "Purchase a medical spoon. A medical spoon is a cheap plastic device that you can buy at your local pharmacy. It has a broad open spoon-shaped end that is connected to a tube. You can use this as an STP device by peeing into the spoon end and directing the stream out of the end of the tube. You can convert a medical spoon into an STP device very easily. [3] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Make a hole in the end of the handle.",
      "content": "Make a hole in the end of the handle. The tube end of the spoon is closed up, so to use it as an STP device you need make a hole in the end for the pee to come out of. There are a few ways you can do this. If you have a drill, you can drill a hole in the end of the tube. This will give you good control and allow you to direct the stream with some accuracy. Alternatively you can slice off the end of the tube. If you do this, you can use a lighter to warm the plastic and make it easier to cut. After slicing off the end of the tube, you can use the lighter to ensure that there are no sharp edges."
    },
    {
      "title": "Practice at home.",
      "content": "Practice at home. After you have made your STP device, you should be sure that you spend some time at home practicing with it. It can be a strange experience at first, and leaks and mess can happen if you are uncertain. Practice using it in the bath, shower, or toilet at home before you try using it in a men’s room."

    {
      "title": "Buy a packer.",
      "content": "Buy a packer. If you prefer to have something that you keep in your pants and looks more like a penis, you can use a packer. Packers are silicon penis shaped objects that you can put in your pants. Using a packer can be a more subtle way to STP, than using a more basic device, such as the medicine spoon. You can buy packers from numerous stores online. Search for \"packers\" and choose the size and colour you want. You can get a packer for around $10-$15. Ensure you buy a soft packer."
    },
    {
      "title": "Get a medicine spoon and some plastic tubing.",
      "content": "Get a medicine spoon and some plastic tubing. You can make a packer into an STP device cheaply and quite easily at home. To do this you will also need to get a medicine spoon, and some relatively narrow plastic tubing. The tubing must be narrow enough to get through the penis, but wide enough so that you can attach it to the medicine spoon without any leaks. 3/8s of an inch is good size tubing to use. You can get this from your local hardware store. Trim down the medicine spoon, and firmly attach the tubing to the end of it. [4] X Research source The medicine tube and tubing will be the channel your pee travels down, through the packer to the urinal."
    },
    {
      "title": "Make a hole in the packer.",
      "content": "Make a hole in the packer. You need to get this tube through the packer, and to do this you need to make a hole in the packer. You can use any long sharp object, such as a screwdriver, or a tent peg. Make sure the object you are using to make the hole is longer than the packer. Carefully but firmly push the screwdriver through the packer, taking care to ensure that it comes out around where the urethra is. Once you have skewered the packer, leave the screwdriver in there. If you are struggling to pierce the packer, you can try heating the piercing device first."
    },
    {
      "title": "Push the tubing through.",
      "content": "Push the tubing through. Now place the tubing and spoon over the end of the screwdriver and work it back through the hole you have just made in the packer. This will take some careful manoeuvring and some brute force, but it will go through eventually. Soft packers are very malleable so they will stand being squeezed and pushed around while you get the tubing through. Once you have gotten the tubing through, the medicine spoon end, which you will pee into, should be protruding sufficiently to use. The end of tube should be the right at the front end of the penis, where the urethra is. You may need to roll the end of the packer back a little when you use it to ensure that the tubing is sticking out of the packer enough to avoid any accidents. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Rinse it after each use.",
      "content": "Rinse it after each use. It’s important to keep your STP device clean, and rinse it off after every use. If you don’t, you will be carrying around an unpleasant smell that can transfer to your clothes. The plastic homemade STP devices are simple to quickly rinse off. The plastic means that the any urine will bead up on the surface and be washed off easily. [6] X Research source You can rinse it with a little soap when you are washing your hands."

      "title": "Store it in a zip-lock bag.",
      "content": "Store it in a zip-lock bag. When you are carrying the STP device around with you, it’s best to try and keep it in a small zip-lock bag. This way any unpleasant aromas or drips will be contained in the bag. If you get a small zip-lock bag, such as a freezer or sandwich bag, you will still be able to keep the STP device in your back pocket. You can also use alcohol wipes or hand sanitizer to disinfect the device after each use."

    {
      "title": "Soak it in a disinfectant solution.",
      "content": "Soak it in a disinfectant solution. You need to take extra steps to ensure that your STP device is kept clean and you limit the risk of infection. Every night you should soak it in a solution that will thoroughly clean it, ready for the next day. Get a bowl and mix up half a cup of 2% or 3% hydrogen peroxide, and a teaspoon of antibacterial soap, in three cups of hot water. Place your device into the solution and leave it to soak for a few hours. Take it out and rinse it thoroughly. Put it on the side and let it air dry."
