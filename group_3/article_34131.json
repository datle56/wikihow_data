      "content": "Bathe or shower regularly to keep your skin and hair clean. Frequent bathing is especially important in hot weather when boils are more likely to form. Bathe or shower at least once a day, and after sweating. This will help prevent the Staphylococcus aureus (staph) bacteria that may be on your skin from getting into your pores or under your skin and starting a boil. [4] X Research source Pay special attention to areas where boils are most likely to form, including the face, neck, armpits, shoulders, and buttocks. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Use a mild antibacterial soap every day to eliminate bacteria on your skin.",
      "content": "Use a mild antibacterial soap every day to eliminate bacteria on your skin. Look for a soap, body wash, or facial cleanser that says \"antibacterial\" on the label. There are many varieties available at your local grocery store or pharmacy. [6] X Research source If you find your antibacterial soap too drying, look for a gentle formulation like Cetaphil. Most antibacterial soaps use the active ingredient triclosan. For a natural alternative, look for a soap containing tea tree oil, a natural antibacterial agent. [7] X Research source In some cases, a prescription strength antibacterial soap may be needed. If you have ongoing problems with boils or other skin infections, ask your doctor about one of these. You can also try an acne body cleanser with benzoyl peroxide."

      "title": "Dry your skin thoroughly after bathing.",
      "content": "Dry your skin thoroughly after bathing. Bacteria thrive in warm, damp environments so careful drying is important. You might also use baby powder, or a medicated powder like Gold Bond to help keep moisture-prone areas drier throughout the day."

      "title": "Try a bleach bath.",
      "content": "Try a bleach bath. Doctors often recommend bleach baths for people with skin problems such as eczema, but they may also help kill the bacteria on your skin that causes boils. [8] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Use ½ cup household bleach in a bathtub full of warm water. Soak for 10-15 minutes. Do not take more than 3 bleach baths per week.

      "title": "Wear clean, loose-fitting clothes.",
      "content": "Wear clean, loose-fitting clothes. Avoid re-wearing clothes that you have sweated in. Wear loose-fitting clothes that will not rub against your skin and irritate it. Tight clothing will not allow your skin to breathe, which can cause irritation and leave you prone to boils."

      "content": "Use shaving gel on wet skin. Shaving is a big cause of ingrown hairs, which can end up becoming infected and leading to boil formation.

      "content": "Keep your razors clean and sharp. Rinse your razor frequently as you shave. Replace disposable razors frequently, and keep other razors sharpened. [13] X Research source Sharp razors mean you have to apply less pressure to the skin to cut the hair, which reduces the likelihood of creating cuts and ingrown hairs."

      "title": "Shave “with the grain.”",
      "content": "Shave “with the grain.” You may have been taught to shave in the opposite direction that your hair is growing, but that can cause ingrown hairs and lead to boils. Shave in the same direction as your hair grows. [14] X Research source This can be a little difficult to determine, especially if you have curly hair. In general, shave your legs in a downward motion. Run your hands along your skin to help you determine what direction your hair is growing."

[15] X Research source “Cosmetic body shaving” for men can also cause MRSA infections. [16] X Research source In general, it’s best to avoid shaving these sensitive areas. Shaving your genitals leaves your skin with small micro-wounds, through which the staph bacteria can enter and cause infection and boils. Because the area is usually sweatier than other areas of your body, the likelihood of boils developing is also higher."

Make sure all family members have their own towels and washcloths, wash them frequently, and keep them separate. The pus that comes out of a boil is highly infectious, and the bacteria can live on most surfaces for some time. Do not share bar soap if you have boils, or with someone who does have boils. You should also avoid sharing razors or sporting equipment. Both “regular” staph and MRSA can be spread by sharing personal items or sporting equipment."
