You may want to choose liquids of the same color as your alcohol to make it more confusing which is which. Try: Water or clear soda to look like vodka, gin, rum, or tequila Grape juice to look like wine or brandy Cola or root beer to look like whiskey or dark rum Ginger ale or cream soda to look like beer Juice or sports drinks to look like colored liquor"

      "content": "Pour the drinks into shot glasses. Get enough glass or disposable plastic shot glasses to complete a big circle or several rows. Pour your alcoholic drink or drinks into half the number of your shot glasses and your non-alcoholic drinks into the other half. You don’t need a specific number, but two shot glasses per player is recommended. [1] X Research source Use different colored and opaque shot glasses to partially disguise the color or type of liquid inside."

      "title": "Place the shot glasses in a circle or rows.",
      "content": "Place the shot glasses in a circle or rows. Set your filled shot glasses on an even surface like a large table or hard floor. Pick a surface that you can easily clean, as shots may get knocked and spilled. If you’re playing the version using a bottle to spin, place the shot glasses in a large circle and put an empty wine, liquor, or beer bottle in the center of the circle. Make sure the bottle is completely empty for the best spin. If you’re playing the version using cards and dice, place the shot glasses in rows."

      "title": "Pick a player to spin first.",
      "content": "Pick a player to spin first. Choose the first player and have them spin the bottle in the middle of the circle of shots. All players can sit or stand in a circle around the shots to watch the bottle spin. The first player can volunteer, or you can choose a fun way to pick who has the first turn, like the youngest person in the group, the winner of a rock-paper-scissors battle, or whoever got out of bed earliest that morning.

      "title": "Drink what the bottle lands on.",
      "content": "Drink what the bottle lands on. Wait for the bottle to come to a stop after spinning. The player who spun must drink the shot that the mouth of the bottle is pointing toward. Don’t let the player smell or examine the shot too closely before drinking it—they must drink it right away! If the bottle isn’t pointing directly at one shot glass, decide on which it is closest to, or default to the shot to its right. If you continue to have this problem, try adding more shot glasses to make a fuller circle."

      "title": "Replace the shot.",
      "content": "Replace the shot. Have the player who spun and drank refill the shot they took. They should refill their shot glass with whatever type of shot (alcoholic or non-alcoholic) they just took. Players can bluff and keep the type of drink they got or refill with a secret. Agree on this before the game begins."

You can play as many times around the circle of players as you like. Players can opt out any time, or you can make rules that a player is “out” if they spill a drink or get three alcoholic shots in a row, for example."

If there is more than one card with the number you rolled, just take one of the shots and leave the rest for other players who might roll that number on their turn. [4] X Research source Count aces as low (value of 1) and face cards as follows: Jack=11, Queen=12, King=13. Because you can’t roll a 1 or a 13 with two dice, you can make up a rule for who has to take a shot that’s on an Ace or King card, like any player who spills a drink or some other “party foul.” If there is no card out that corresponds to the number you rolled, roll again until you get an available number, or take a shot that’s on an Ace or King card if there is one out."

Players can bluff about what type of drink they got if they want to throw other players off as to how many alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks are left in the game. For example, if someone takes an alcoholic shot and makes that known with a face or an exclamation about it, everyone will know that there is one less alcoholic drink on the table for future turns."

As the number of shots left gets smaller and smaller, players roll on their turn until they get the number that corresponds to a card that still has a shot. The round ends when all of the shots are gone."
