In general, you want to find a pair of gardening gloves that are comfortable and reasonably durable. [5] X Research source Use whatever pair of gardening gloves you have in your shed. Any pair will do for weeding, but it is preferable to have a pair with wrist closure. Purchase a new pair of gardening gloves from a home and garden center. Look for a pair that fits your hands and has some design features such as reinforced fingertips, double stitching, and wrist closure. [6] X Research source If you're weeding abrasive or pointy weeds, like thistle, get gloves made of leather or another thick material."

      "content": "Pick up your weeding tools. Weeding tools are great if you want to keep your hands clean or if you are weeding in an area that is particularly tough, such as an area with hard soil, a crack in the pavement , or a high concentration of weeds. Weeding tools are also great if you want to save some energy, since using your hands to weed can be quite exhausting. You should go to the shed and pick up the weeding tools you need for your job. If you are weeding in a tightly planted area and will be working on your knees, you will need a short handled weeding tool. If you are weeding a large area of the garden and plan to complete the weeding standing up, you will need a long handled weeding tool. [7] X Research source If you do not have the right weeding tools for your job, you may need to visit your local home and garden center to purchase an appropriate weeding tool. If you are buying a new weeding tool, you may want to examine the sharpness of the tool, whether it is made with good materials (for example, a stainless steel blade), and whether or not it will work for the most common weeding tasks in your garden. You should also consider whether you can comfortably grip the tool in your hands. [8] X Research source The Japanese farmer's knife is a type of short handled weeding tool that can be used to stab and saw through roots and pull up tough weeds. [9] X Research source The Cape Cod weeder is a type of short handled weeding tool that is especially good for weeding in tight spaces of your garden. [10] X Research source The radius pro weeder is a long handled weeder that has a circular handle, which is great for people with arthritis or wrist troubles. [11] X Research source The weed dragon garden torch cooks your weeds to eliminate them for good. It emits a flame that cooks the weeds and eventually kills them, since they are then unable to take in nutrients. [12] X Research source"

      "content": "Protect yourself from the sun. You should put on a hat and some sunscreen lotion. Weeding is exhausting work that usually involves exposure to the sun, so you will need to protect your face, neck and any other exposed parts of your body. Use a sunscreen with SPF 15 or higher. If you have fair skin, you should be using at least SPF 30. The SPF number tells you how well the sunscreen protects you from burning. [13] X Research source Choose a sunscreen that has good water or sweat resistance. Weeding is tough work that involves some sweating, so you should make sure your sunscreen can stand up to the job.

If there are pitchforks lying on the ground, remove them so you don't trip on them. Remove any such hazards so that you can weed in peace. If there is stinging nettle in the area, take a note of where it is located so you can avoid being stung. If there are poisonous snakes in your area, take a look to make sure there aren't any in your garden. On hot days, watch out for snakes in cool and shady areas. In general, snakes will be attracted to any area of your garden that is cool, moist and cavernous. [16] X Research source Check to make sure you know where the first aid kit is located in your garden or house, so that you can get it if you get a scrape or cut while weeding. Although weeding is not generally a dangerous activity, it is good to be prepared just in case."

While you are surveying the bed, take a close look to identify edible weeds that you may want to keep such as dandelion, amaranth, plantain or lamb's quarters. [17] X Research source Once you have an idea of what you want to pull up and what you want to leave, start weeding the bed. Consider whether you want to harvest edible weeds to eat later. Many edible plants are commonly seen as weeds but are great additions to salads and stir fries. For instance, dandelions are commonly seen as a weed but are actually a very tasty vegetable that can be added to salads, stir fries, and soups. [18] X Research source You may not have planted these edible plants yourself, but they can be desirable nonetheless. Pull them up and store them in a mason jar in your fridge."

For example, some people prefer to wear garden gloves and use a weeding tool in order to keep their hands clean. However, many gardeners enjoy the feeling of getting their hands dirty and are happy to use their hands. Grip the bottom of the weed tightly and pull it sharply out of the ground. Try to pull the whole weed out of the garden in one piece by pulling straight up rather than at an angle, so you don't have to repeat this step. Repeat the process until you have a weed-free garden If you are unsuccessful in pulling up the roots of the weed, you can use your weeding tool to dig a little deeper and pull up any remaining roots. If you have trouble pulling up the taproot, you can use your weeding tool to cut deeper into the root system."

If you have a curbside lawn waste program, you can put your weeds in a bag and dispose of them on the appropriate day for lawn waste pickup. If you compost your weeds, avoid putting weeds that can re-root themselves easily into your compost. Throw weeds in the trash if this is a concern. Avoid disposing of your weeds on public lands. Many weeds are invasive species and will have a damaging impact on public parks and conservation areas."

Start by doing a lateral stretch to loosen up your back and shoulders, then stand forward and bend to loosen up chest, legs, back and shoulders. You can finish your routine with a goddess pose to loosen up the hips. The lateral stretch is great for your back and shoulders. Standing with your feet together and slightly bent, place your left hand on your hip and extend your right harm overhead. Lean to the left while keeping your body aligned. Then, repeat the stretch on your other side. To complete the forward bend: lean forward over your knees with your arms behind your back and your fingers interlaced. Relax your neck and shoulders. To complete the goddess pose: lie on the floor with your knees bent and your feet touching. Allow your knees to lower to the floor. You can put your arms above your head at the same time, with your fingers touching."

You can use logs, bricks, branches, cedar, sandbags and other common materials to make your own raised beds. If you are less inclined to do it yourself, you can also purchase a raised garden bed from many home and garden centers. [21] X Research source"
