      "content": "Choose the type of lemon you want to grow. The steps throughout this guide will apply to pretty much any type of lemon seed, so choose the lemon that you’re most interested in growing! Consider size, flavor, and whether you want an ornamental or culinary lemon. Then, you can just pick out your preferred lemon from the supermarket or nursery—look for a fruit with a full, mature appearance that’s free of blemishes, cuts, and bruises. Here are some of the most common types of lemons you can grow at home. [1] X Research source Eureka lemons: The standard grocery market lemon. Large fruit with a tart flavor. Great for juicing. Grows flowers nearly year-round. Lisbon lemons: Produces highly acidic fruits that are often sold in grocery stores. Excellent for juicing. Produces fruits several times a year. Meyer lemons: Hybrid between lemon and sweet orange. Produces small, round fruits with a sweet floral taste (not so acidic or sour). Variegata (pink) lemons: Mutant of the Eureka lemon. Produces fruits with pink pulp (similar to a grapefruit) and yellow-green stripes on the rind."

      "content": "Carefully remove the seed from the lemon. Peel your lemon like an orange—rather than slicing it—to avoid piercing the seeds inside. Then, use your hands to pull apart the individual wedges of the lemon. Remove any intact seed that you want from your lemon and place it in a cup of water. [2] X Trustworthy Source University of California Division of Agriculture and Natural Resources Extension program of the University of California system devoted to educating and improving local communities Go to source Consider planting 5 to 10 lemon seeds at one time, in case some of the seeds don't sprout or don't make it past seedling-hood. Keep in mind that trees that come from seeds are not identical to the parent tree that they came from. Sometimes, the fruit that the new saplings produce is of a lesser quality. Other times, they do not produce edible fruit at all, but they’ll still be visually pleasing."

Let the bowl sit for 1-3 days, then remove your seed from the bowl. Rinse off the seed, remove any residual lemon pulp, and pat dry with a paper towel. Clip off the end of the seed with a pair of nail clippers or a small pair of scissors. Use your fingernails to carefully remove the outermost layer of the seed.

      "content": "Transplant the plant into a larger container after it’s produced 3 leaves. Once your seedling has produced three sets of genuine leaves, transplant it to a larger and more permanent container with drainage holes. Choose a pot that’s about 3 to 4 inches (7.62 to 10.16 centimeters) wide and 5 to 6 inches (12.7 to 15.24 centimeters) deep. [6] X Research source Fill the pot with lightweight and well-draining potting soil or add pumice, perlite, or sand to a standard soil mix to help with draining. Stop when the top of the soil is about 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) from the rim. Gently move the seedlings from their starting container to the larger pot. Avoid peat moss and peat-based soils for lemon trees. Peat retains too much water and may encourage root rot."

As your seedling begins to grow into a tree, make sure it’s getting at least 6-8 hours of sun or light each day. If you’re planting your lemon tree outside, keep it in an area with full sun. If you’re planting your lemon tree inside, Leahy advises to keep it in a “sunny room” in “direct sun.” Ideally, your lemon tree pot will be near a south-facing, sunny window—but you can also use grow lights to supplement the natural light."

      "title": "Thoroughly water the lemon tree whenever the soil becomes dry.",
      "content": "Thoroughly water the lemon tree whenever the soil becomes dry. Lemon trees need water like any other plant, but they can easily rot or become diseased if given too much, so you should “leave them to dry out between watering schedules,” says Leahy. Rather than sticking to a weekly schedule, check for when your lemon tree’s soil becomes dry and water it then—Leahy goes on to explain that the plant needs to be on the drier side before you give it more water. Wait until the soil is on the “dry side of moist” or when the soil is just barely moist. When it’s time to water, water until the soil is thoroughly and evenly moistened. If you’re growing your lemon tree outdoors, make sure that the tree is planted in an area that won’t retain moisture for an extended period of time after rainfall."

If your young lemon tree isn’t branching on its own, cut off the tips of the central shoot and any side branches around the top of the plant. You can also prune your tree at any time to shape it, although this type of pruning is up to your preferences—this step is not necessary for the growth of the plant. [9] X Research source You may notice some thorns developing on the nodes of your lemon tree as it grows. You can prune off thorns if desired, but you don’t have to by any means."

Remove the lemon tree from its container and place it in a new one that’s about 1–2 inches (25–51 mm) wide in diameter. Add more well-draining potting soil to the new container as needed and water the soil thoroughly. [10] X Research source If you’d like to reuse the same pot, you’ll have to prune the roots of your lemon tree first—although this may limit its growth. Use pruners or a small hand saw to cut 1 ⁄ 3 – 2 ⁄ 3 inch (8.5–16.9 mm) off of the root ball. Place fresh potting soil into the container and replant the tree. Mature lemon trees (7-15 years old) only need to be repotted every 3-4 years."

      "content": "Harvest firm and bright yellow lemons with a pair of scissors. After 4-5 years, your lemon tree should start producing fragrant flowers. If your tree is inside, you can attempt to hand-pollinate the flowers by gently shaking the branches or flicking the flowers with your finger. However, most lemon trees will not produce fruit until fully mature—about 7-15 years after planting from seed. [11] X Research source If your lemon tree is producing fruit, look for citruses that are firm and bright yellow in color. You should be able to easily harvest these lemons by clipping them off the tree with a pair of scissors. Ripe lemons can typically last for up to a few months on a tree, so you don’t need to worry too much about them rotting on the plant."

These pests are more likely to appear on a lemon tree if it’s kept indoors or if it’s not kept in humid enough conditions. [12] X Research source For an easy fix against pests, dampen a cotton round with rubbing alcohol and dab it onto the bugs themselves. Or, douse them with an organic pesticide like neem oil , insecticidal soap , or pyrethrin .

Scale insects can be slightly more difficult to treat. Try simply wiping away the scale with your fingers or removing them with a strong spray of water. If your scale outbreak is particularly bad, you can use certain chemicals to treat it. However, this may affect whether or not you can eat your lemons later on. [14] X Research source"

Common signs of root rot include stunted growth, yellowing leaves, twig dieback, and dried-out wood. If you see these signs of root rot on your lemon tree, it’s likely suffering from poor drainage. Make sure your pot or container has drainage holes and is filled with well-draining soil. If your tree is planted outside, make sure it’s in a well-draining location.
