      "content": "Cut out the paper pattern pieces for your pockets. If you are following a pattern that includes pockets, locate the pocket pieces and cut them out. If you are not using a pattern, then draw and cut your own paper pattern piece to ensure that all of your pocket pieces will be the same size. [1] X Research source You can make your pants pockets any size you like, but a 10 by 5 in (25 by 13 cm) rectangle is a good size. If you want to use a pattern, but don’t have one, there are some free pocket patterns available online. [2] X Research source If you prefer a curved edge on the bottom of the pockets, then cut out a rectangle and then cut around the corners on 1 side to round them out."

      "title": "Pin the paper pattern piece onto your fabric.",
      "content": "Pin the paper pattern piece onto your fabric. Smooth out the fabric that you want to use for the pockets and lay your paper pattern piece on top of it. Pin the pattern in place so that all of its edges are over the fabric. Insert a pin about every 2–3 in (5.1–7.6 cm) along the edges of the pocket piece. [3] X Research source Make sure that the pins go all the way through the pattern and fabric. You can use any woven cotton fabric for your pockets. For dress pants, a common choice is silesia.

      "title": "Cut along the edges of the paper pattern.",
      "content": "Cut along the edges of the paper pattern. Use a sharp pair of fabric scissors to cut out the fabric. Follow the edges of the pattern that you pinned onto the fabric. [5] X Research source Repeat this 1 time to make a second matching piece for the pocket. You will need 2 pieces for each pocket, so create a total of 4 pieces if you want to add 1 pocket on each side of your pants. If you notice any notches on the paper pattern pieces, make sure to cut around these when you cut out the fabric. These will be useful for lining up your pocket pieces."

      "title": "Transfer any marks on the paper pattern piece to the fabric pieces.",
      "content": "Transfer any marks on the paper pattern piece to the fabric pieces. After you have cut out the fabric piece for your pockets, use a piece of chalk or a fabric marker to transfer any marks that are on the pattern onto the fabric pieces in the same locations. [6] X Research source For example, there may be 2 dots on the paper pattern piece to indicate where you will need to leave the pocket opening. Mark these on the same spots of your fabric pieces. If you created your own pattern, then you will not need to worry about adding marks to the fabric pieces."

      "content": "Lay 1 pocket piece onto the edge of your pants and line up the marks. Position the pants fabric so that the right (print or outer) side is facing up and then lay 1 pocket piece right-side down on top of the pants. Line up any marks on the pocket piece with the marks on the pants. Position the pocket piece so that the edge of the pocket aligns with the edge of the pants fabric. [7] X Research source If you are adding pockets to pants that are already finished, then you will need to open up the side seam of your pants to attach the pockets. Use a seam ripper to cut away the stitches in the side seam from the top of the waistband down to the bottom of the pocket. [8] X Expert Source David Pew Professional Tailor Expert Interview. 5 January 2021. If the pattern has notches on it, make sure to line these up with any notches in your pants. [9] X Research source Make sure you pin the pocket so it isn't going to show from the outside. [10] X Expert Source David Pew Professional Tailor Expert Interview. 5 January 2021."

Sew the straight stitch about 0.5 in (1.3 cm) from the raw edges of the pocket and pants. Keep sewing until you reach the bottom of the pocket.

Position the pocket on the other side of the pants, such as the front if you sewed the back piece first. Sew this piece in the same fashion. Then, repeat the whole process again to sew a front and back piece onto the opposite side of the pants. [13] X Research source For example, if you are sewing 1 pocket into each side of your pants, then sew 1 piece onto the front and 1 piece onto the back piece on each side of the pants for a total of 4 pocket pieces."

Then, iron over the seam to flatten it out. This will help to improve the appearance of the pants once they are finished. [14] X Research source For delicate fabrics, use the lowest possible setting on your iron. You may also want to lay a t-shirt or thin towel over the fabric before you sew."

[17] X Research source You may also place 2 pins in an X shape through each of these dots to remind yourself not to sew across this section of the pocket. If you are not working from a pattern, measure 1 in (2.5 cm) from the top of the pocket and then measure a 5 in (13 cm) wide line along the seam where the pants and pocket meet.

Sew back by 1 in (2.5 cm) to secure the end of your stitches. Then, release the lever and sew forward to the X mark again and stop the machine.
