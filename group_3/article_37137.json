Due to the high degree of anonymity on the internet, investigating identity theft is difficult. However, as several United States criminal cases have shown, perpetrators are sometimes prosecuted for identity theft. [8] X Research source If someone is pretending to be you online and hurting your reputation, it is likely that the perpetrator is someone you know, rather than an anonymous scam artist. Police typically do not treat identity theft the same way they treat traditional crimes. This is because perpetrators of identity theft work through the internet and are usually located across jurisdictional boundaries from their victims. For this reason, police are unlikely to pursue your case if you cannot identify a perpetrator who lives in their jurisdiction."

For example, a woman prosecuted for posing as her ex-boyfriend online posted comments stating that he had a sexually-transmitted disease and used drugs. [9] X Research source Also keep copies of any communications (emails, texts, or voicemails) from the perpetrator about the identity theft.
