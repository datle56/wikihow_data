      "content": "Cut your cardboard in the shape of a tomahawk. [1] X Research source You should cut two pieces that are the full outline of a traditional tomahawk, including the ax-head and handle. You might want to consider adding support to the handle to make it more sturdy. You can do this easily by cutting 2 additional separate pieces of the tomahawk handle, which you will use later for support. To give a 3D appearance to the ax-head of your tomahawk, you can add a couple of pieces of cardboard cut only in the shape of the ax-head. You might want these to be slightly smaller than the full size ax-head. This will give contour and make it even more realistic."
    },
    {
      "title": "Glue your pieces together.",
      "content": "Glue your pieces together. Your ax-head/handle combined pieces should be glued together first, with your supporting handle-only pieces glued on the outside. The same goes for your ax-head; the slightly smaller ax-head-only pieces should be glued on the outside of the ax-head on the ax-head/handle combined pieces. You should allow your glued together pieces enough time to fully dry before you move on from this stage in the tomahawk making process."

      "content": "Apply some papier-mâché. To make the adhesive for your papier-mâché, you can dilute some normal all-purpose glue (sometimes called PVA glue) in a small amount of water. [2] X Research source Use a paintbrush to apply your glue-water solution to your scrap paper and the surface of your cardboard tomahawk. For scrap paper, you might use thin brown paper, like the kind used for paper lunch bags or grocery bags. Cover the cardboard of your 'hawk so that it has a uniform appearance. To give a stone-like effect to your ax-head, you might want to crinkle the paper that you paste to it. To make the handle of your 'hawk appear wooden, you should try to glue your papier-mâché to the handle as smoothly as possible."

      "content": "Paint your toy tomahawk. If you are going for the classic appearance, you'll want gray and brown paint for the ax-head and the handle, respectively. Native Americans did not learn ironworking until after the arrival of colonists, so the more authentic 'hawks will have heads made of stone instead of metal."

      "content": "Add finishing touches. These will depend on your preference, but at this point, you might consider wrapping the head of your 'hawk in twine using a criss-cross pattern that goes around the handle, making it appear as though the head and handle are tied together. You can also: Give the appearance of wood finish by taping the handle in clear tape. Glue or tie beads, ribbons, and/or feathers to create a more ceremonial looking 'hawk. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Prepare your work area, if necessary. You don't want any flammable materials around if you intend on using a plasma torch to cut your tomahawk head. Bare earth or concrete will reduce the possibilities of a spark from your torch causing a fire. Working on a steel table that's a comfortable height for you is recommended. Be wary if your table or anything else has a coating. These can sometimes be highly flammable, and the fumes can be toxic."

The ideal length for your tomahawk will be between 16\" and 21\" depending on your preference and body type. You should start with a longer handle and give it a try before cutting it down to size. You can always remove more of your handle once you have discovered it is longer than is comfortable."

While looking for a stone, you will want one that is slightly thicker than that of your handle and mostly flat, without any jagged edges or cracks. The stone and handle will be notched later so that each fits together sturdily. A suitable, sturdy wooden handle can be bought at your local hardware store. Just about any kind of wood can be used in this process, so long as the thickness of the handle is slightly larger in diameter than that of your stone."

      "content": "Prepare to fashion your ax-head. For the best possible fit for your tomahawk, you will want to make a corresponding notch to your handle in your stone. First you should make sure you are properly prepared to use your grinder, or other stone cutter, to notch your stone. Cutting stone can create a good amount of dust. You should wear a respirator or, at minimum, a mask to prevent from breathing in this dust. [7] X Research source Have a container of cool water nearby. Grinding or cutting stone will create a good amount of heat. You should dunk your stone regularly in your container of water to keep it from overheating. Eye protection is necessary in case a piece of rock or your fiber wheel breaks free during this process. [8] X Research source Head protection, like a thick wool hat, can also provide ideal protection if a chipped piece of stone or equipment flies of your grinding wheel."

Stone working tools are designed for this purpose and are exceptionally good at shaping stone, but careless use can result in severe injury. Depending on your grinder/cutter, there could be many configurations for use of this tool. Follow all directions as outlined in the manual, but, in principle: Place your stone securely in the cutting area. Make sure all safety catches are in place and guides are in place. Clear all debris from the cutting area that you might get in your way. Turn on your grinder/stone cutting tool. Lower the blade to cut a notch in your stone ¼\" wide. The depth of your notch will have to be determined with regard to the slot you've made on your handle. The total thickness of the notched part of your stone should be slightly larger than the slot you've made on your handle. [9] X Research source"

Using your pliers, carefully bend the slotted end of your handle outward to make room for your ax-head. Be sure your wood does not crack when doing this. You should keep boiling water at the ready. Heat will go out of your wooden handle at a fairly quick rate. To maintain the flexibility of your wood, you will need to keep it hot."

Once the wood is soft, check to see if the head fits and make adjustments if you find it necessary.

Once the stone is in place, bend the ends of your slotted wood back inward to snugly hold your stone ax-head in place.
