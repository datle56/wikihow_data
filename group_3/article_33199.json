Tell the players that they must interview each other. Have each player go around the group and ask other people to check off one box that applies to them. Names or signatures on multiple boxes won't count. If your party has a very small number of people, the signature rules are more lenient and can be signed upon if any trivia applies to the person. Reinforce that socializing is a must! This entire game is based around getting to know each other, so encourage chatting and getting to know one another."

      "content": "Declare the winner with a full or completed signed card. Let the players know to come to you when their card is full and you can call out the winner. Alternatively, you could declare winners when a row (across, up, down or diagonal) has been checked off; this depends on whether you want to speed things up or not. Offer a small door prize such as a chocolate bar, or a cake, to the winner."
