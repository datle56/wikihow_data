      "title": "What states are considered “Midwestern”?",
      "content": "What states are considered “Midwestern”? Let’s face it, the Midwest is more of an idea than a region. That said, according to the Census Bureau, the Midwest officially includes Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, Ohio, South Dakota, and Wisconsin. [9] X Research source However, you’re likely to find some cultural and linguistic overlap with other states that touch on the Midwest. For instance, if you grew up in Western Pennsylvania, some of the sayings in this article might be familiar to you, and you might consider yourself an honorary Midwesterner (but you might get some pushback). Further, every state within the Midwestern region has its own particular culture and slang. For example, the expression “Uff da” is common in the Upper Midwest, while folks in other regions of the Midwest might never have even heard this expression before in their life. And Southern Ohio falls more into the Appalachian region than the Midwest, and so might have more Appalachian sensibilities."
