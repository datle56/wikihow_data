      "content": "Buy Epsom salt. Epsom salt is available at most drug stores. You’ll likely find it in the same section as painkillers (aspirin, ibuprofen etc.) and bandages, since it’s often used for muscle aches. Make sure that the packaging of your Epsom salt specifies that they are suitable for human use (in the USA, the package would show a USP designation). [1] X Research source All Epsom salt contains the same naturally occurring minerals (magnesium and sulfate), but there are different “grades” depending on how you intend to use the Epsom salt (for example, “human use” or “agricultural applications”).

      "title": "Buy a foot bath.",
      "content": "Buy a foot bath. Foot baths (also known as pedicure bowls) or appropriately sized wash basins should be easy to find at your local department stores or big-box stores (also known as superstores). They might also be available at larger drugstores. If you’re on a budget, a wash basin will be cheaper than a foot bath. As it is not specifically designed for feet, make sure you buy something large enough to comfortably fit both your feet (you might even try standing in it in the store). Consider the depth of the basin as well — you’ll want the water to reach just above your ankles. If you buy a foot bath/pedicure bowl, make sure that you’re able to safely put ingredients besides water into the tub before you buy it."

Some pumice stones just look like a stone, others come on rope, and others come on sticks. None are inherently better than the others; just choose what you like the best. Make sure to purchase a pumice stone specifically made for beauty purposes, or you’ll risk damaging your skin."

Wherever you decide to soak your feet, ensure that you’ve got the area properly set up before moving on to the next steps. If you wish to rinse your feet after the soak, it’s a good idea to stay in or near the bathroom."

      "content": "Be aware of the type of floor you’re soaking your feet on. If you are on tiles or hardwood, place a towel on the floor so that you won’t damage your floors or slip on any water that might spill as you soak and exfoliate your feet. If you are on carpet, you may want to put the basin/foot bath on a place mat or some other form of waterproof material to protect your carpet."

      "content": "Fill your basin or foot bath with hot water. Use the hottest water that you can tolerate without scalding your feet. Be careful not to overfill it. Fill the basin up about 2/3rds of the way to the top. This will leave enough room for your feet, which will displace the water once you put them in the basin/foot bath. Check to make sure you can tolerate the water before adding the Epsom salt to avoid wasting the salt if you later need to dump some hot water out and add some cool water. If you have a foot bath/pedicure tub, consider taking advantage of additional settings like vibrations to boost your experience."

For a standard-sized foot bath (or foot bath-sized basin), add 1/2 a cup (118 ml) of Epsom salt. If you wish, you can also add a few drops of essential oils, such as lavender oil. These can not only give your foot bath a relaxing scent, but may also have added benefits, like antimicrobial properties. [3] X Research source"

Applying light to medium pressure, rub the pumice stone on the wet, callused parts of your feet for 2 to 3 minutes to remove dead skin. Rubbing too hard with a pumice stone can result in irritated skin and infection. It shouldn’t hurt, so if it begins to, either rub more gently or, if your skin is very irritated, stop all together until it heals. You can use a pumice stone daily, but be sure to rinse it after every use. If it looks particularly worn, try boiling it or, if that doesn’t seem to refresh it, replace it. [6] X Research source If you can’t find or don’t want to use a pumice stone, you can also purchase a foot file at most drugstores and superstores. You use it much like a pumice stone, rubbing it against the callused parts of your feet with gentle to medium pressure, and backing off if it hurts."

If the bath is full of dead skin bits or if you just feel cleaner rinsing with clean water after the soak, place your feet under a tap and rinse your feet using lukewarm water. Some people claim that Epsom salt is detoxifying, and that it is necessary to rinse after soaking in an Epsom salt bath so as to remove the toxins that have come to the surface of your skin. There is little to no scientific evidence to show this is true, but it also doesn’t hurt to rinse! [7] X Research source"

If your feet aren’t super cracked or dry, you can get away with a lighter moisturizer; if they’re very dry, you might want to use something heavier or even made specifically for cracked, dry feet. After applying a gentle oil or lotion, cover your feet up with socks before bed. Avoid moisturizing with petroleum-based products, as these may be carcinogenic. [8] X Research source"
