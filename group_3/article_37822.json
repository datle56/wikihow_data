      "content": "Put a rubber band around your index and middle fingers. You can choose your dominant or non-dominant hand, whichever feels comfortable. Slide the band down so it’s at the base of your two fingers, just above your knuckles. Face the back of your hand to your spectator. [1] X Research source If you’re using a large rubber band, wrap it twice around your fingers to make the trick easier. The band should fit snugly around your fingers. This is a classic magic trick invented by magician Stanley Collins in the early 20th century."

      "content": "Stretch the rubber band against your fingers to show it’s securely positioned. Insert one finger from your free hand into the rubber band loop. Move that finger up and down to demonstrate that it’s secure—and distract your spectator from what you’re about to do. [2] X Research source Only let the spectator see the back of your hand."

      "title": "Discreetly curl all your fingers and wrap the band around them.",
      "content": "Discreetly curl all your fingers and wrap the band around them. As you’re stretching the rubber band up and down, curl your fingers and stretch it around all four of them. Hide this from the spectator by pretending you’re still just stretching the band up and down. Be sure your fingers are curled toward your chest. [3] X Research source Place the band right below your cuticles."

      "title": "Uncurl your fingers quickly and watch the band jump.",
      "content": "Uncurl your fingers quickly and watch the band jump. Because of the way you wrapped the band around your fingers, when you uncurl them, the band “jumps” down to your pinky and ring fingers. [4] X Research source As you uncurl them, say a phrase like “Voila!” for an added flourish."

[5] X Research source Let your index finger (aka your pointer finger) rest behind the rubber band, not in front of it or between its loop. TikTokers made this trick go viral, calling it the spinning hair tie trick or the hair tie challenge . They do the trick in time to a snippet of the song “peekaboo” by Kendrick Lamar. While it’s possible to do the trick with a loose hair tie, it works better with a flexible rubber band."

Next, lift your index finger under the second side of the rubber band. Slip your thumb out of the band. It’s now twisted around your middle and index fingers in a figure-8 shape.

When you’re ready, slip the middle finger out to release the band. Watch in amazement as it spins around your outstretched index finger. [8] X Research source Once you slip your middle finger out of the band, lower your thumb so it’s out of the way during the spins.
