If you can, contact the fence’s manufacturer to get new panels identical to the old ones. Take a picture of your fence and send it to companies to ensure you get the right panels. [1] X Research source Try to get replacement parts that are the same size and look as close as possible to the rest of your fence. Home improvement stores may also sell fence parts and repair kits."

      "content": "Unscrew the top rail at the ends. The top rail attaches to the closest posts. Look for a pair of screws at the ends, securing the rail to those posts. Turn the screws counterclockwise to remove them, then set them aside. [2] X Research source These screws may be underneath the caps on the posts. Gently lift them with a hammer and chisel if you can’t remove them by hand. Keep the screws in a safe spot, such as a closed container, so they can be reused later."

If your fence's panels have pickets, or vertical bars, behind them, the screws may be at the panel's ends. Turn them counterclockwise to remove them. [3] X Research source Not all fences have pickets or screws. Your fence's panels may be held in place with brackets, which you can slide the panels out of."

If you took off all of the screws earlier, the panel should come off of the fence easily. [4] X Research source If the panel is next to a post, it may be attached with side brackets. Carefully move the panel to the side and out of the brackets."

      "content": "Check the alignment of the posts with a level. Before installing the new panels, make sure the fence posts are level. Hold a level against the side of each connecting post. If a post is positioned correctly, the level will be appear flat from top to bottom. Straighten the posts as needed. [5] X Research source If your posts are held in the ground with concrete, they most likely will not need to be adjusted."

Use these to fasten the panels to the stabilizing pickets, if your fence has them. Finish adjusting the top rail, then tighten the screws near the fence posts to secure it in place. [7] X Research source If the screw holes do not line up, you can fill the existing panel holes with spray foam, then drill new holes 1 in (2.5 cm) deep."
