A quadratic equation takes the form of a x 2 + b x + c = 0 {\\displaystyle ax^{2}+bx+c=0} . [2] X Research source Remember that a quadratic equation will have two roots (two values for x {\\displaystyle x} ). Using the quadratic formula will provide you with these roots. Understanding the purpose of a complicated math formula makes it much easier to remember.

The formula is x = − b ± b 2 − 4 a c 2 a {\\displaystyle x={\\frac {-b\\pm {\\sqrt {b^{2}-4ac}}}{2a}}} , where the variables a {\\displaystyle a} , b {\\displaystyle b} , and c {\\displaystyle c} are derived from the coefficients in the quadratic equation a x 2 + b x + c = 0 {\\displaystyle ax^{2}+bx+c=0} . Plug the values of these variables into the formula.

You can make the song as silly or catchy as you want, but make sure to not make it too complicated, or it will be difficult to remember. Write down the lyrics of the song so that you remember it. Even better, make a video of yourself singing it. Then you can listen to the video during your study sessions and sing along with it. You could also post it to YouTube or another website so that it can help others who are also trying to remember the formula."

      "content": "Create an expression mnemonic associating familiar names and numbers. Use names of famous people, or people you know, that begin with the letter of the variable. For example, if your sister's name is Becky, your friend's name is Ann, and your dog's name is Cody, you can memorize “Negative Becky, plus or minus the square root of Becky squared minus 4 Ann-Cody, over 2 Anns.”"

      "content": "Invent a story. Associate all of the symbols, numbers, and variables with images and actions that help you remember the formula. Inventing a unique, silly story can help memorize quickly. This method is good for visual learners, as it will help you make a visual representation of the formula. [9] X Research source For example, you can associate a negative/minus sign with being sad, and a positive/plus sign with being happy. You can associate a radical sign with an umbrella, and a fraction with a subway. The variables can stand for the first letter in the name of a person or animal. For example, for the quadratic formula you could make up the following story: “A sad bison approached an umbrella that could have been happy or sad. Underneath the umbrella was a square bison and four sad alley cats. They all stood over a subway where 2 aardvarks were dancing.” Write down your story so that you can re-read it as you try to memorize the formula."

It is extra helpful to visualize what that person or thing might look like. Coming up with your own names and images can help the mnemonic stick by making it meaningful for you. For example, to remember the first part of the formula, − b ± {\\displaystyle -b\\pm } , you could use the name “Negbee, Prime Minister” and visualize what such a leader might look like. To remember b 2 {\\displaystyle {\\sqrt {b^{2}}}} , you could say the phrase “Square Root Beer Square” and visualize a square made out of Root Beer wearing glasses."
