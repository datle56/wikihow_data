      "content": "Wear gloves, safety glasses, and a face mask. Tile shards can be very sharp, so wear thick work gloves and safety glasses when handling them. Wear long sleeves and pants while working to avoid any cuts. Though breaking apart ceramic doesn’t produce a lot of dust, wearing a face mask will prevent you from breathing in any that does get kicked up. [1] X Research source If you’re working on a large tile floor, wear knee pads so you stay comfortable."

      "title": "Use a chisel and hammer to lift the tiles.",
      "content": "Use a chisel and hammer to lift the tiles. Hold the chisel with your non-dominant hand so the sharp edge is against the bottom of the tile. Hit the end of your chisel’s handle with a hammer to loosen the tiles from the floor. Some tiles may break apart and others may come up undamaged. [2] X Research source Use a chisel with a wide-backed handle so you can easily hit it with your hammer. Chiseling out your tiles takes the longest amount of time, but ensures that you don’t damage anything underneath the tiles."

      "content": "Break the tiles with a hammer or sledgehammer if you don’t need to save them. Start with tiles on the outer edge of the room or wall. Use a hammer on small wall tiles or a 3–5 lb (1.4–2.3 kg) sledgehammer for larger floor tiles. Work across the whole room until all the tiles are destroyed. [3] X Research source Wear earplugs if the sound starts to bother you. Don’t use a sledgehammer if you don’t want to damage drywall or flooring underneath your tile. [4] X Research source"

Apply a firm amount of pressure to your chisel to lift the mortar off of your floor. Hit the end of your chisel with a hammer if you cannot lift up the mortar by yourself. [5] X Research source Make sure to remove all the mortar so the surface is smooth. That way, you can easily lay another type of flooring or wall coating on top of it."

      "content": "Rent a hammer chisel. A hammer chisel is an electric machine similar to a jackhammer. Many home improvement stores offer a day-to-day rental service so you don’t have to buy your own, so call a few stores and see what their daily rates are. Some hammer chisels are handheld so they can be used on walls or floors, while others are larger and made just for floors. Pick the right hammer chisel for your job. Hammer chisel rentals usually cost around $50-$60 USD per day."

      "content": "Remove the grout around the tile with a grout saw. Grout saws resemble utility knives and are used to remove grout surrounding tiles. Hold your grout saw firmly in your dominant hand and work around the tile you want to remove. Use long strokes as you apply firm pressure to cut into the grout so the tile comes up easier. [9] X Research source Grout saws can be purchased at any hardware or home improvement store."

      "content": "Hit the tile with a hammer to loosen it. Set the hammerhead directly in the center of the tile. Lift the hammer up and bring it back down in the middle of the tile with a firm amount of pressure. This helps loosen the tile more and break apart some of the adhesive on the bottom. [10] X Research source You can also try drilling through the saw with an abrasive diamond drill bit. Work with your drill on slow speed, and continuously dip the bit in a little water to keep it from overheating.
