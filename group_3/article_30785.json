      "content": "Find a large stock pot and a smaller bowl or saucepan that will fit inside. If you already have a double boiler , go ahead and use the 2 pots it comes with. If you don’t have one, pick out a large stock pot for the base, then find a metal saucepan or bowl that fits comfortably inside your stock pot. Pick a bowl or saucepan that can rest securely on the lip of the stock pot, so that it doesn’t touch the bottom. A metal bowl with a wide rim or a saucepan with a long handle usually work well for this. [1] X Research source Don’t use plastic or glass for the smaller piece of your double boiler. These materials can melt or shatter when heated up. Since you'll be placing the beeswax directly into the smaller saucepan or bowl, try to choose an old one that you won’t be using for food preparation. The beeswax can get pretty sticky, and it may be hard to remove it completely."

      "content": "Fill the bottom of the large stock pot with water. Depending on which type of bowl you’re nesting inside the larger pot, you may need more or less water. If you’re floating a small saucepan inside the larger pot, fill the stock pot so it’s about ¾ full. If you’re using a metal bowl that rests on the lip of the stock pot, fill the stock pot with about 2 to 3 in (5.1 to 7.6 cm) of water. If you have a double boiler that was specifically built for this purpose, check the user manual for instructions on how much water to use."

      "content": "Heat the water on the stove until it boils. Place the large stock pot filled with water on your stovetop, turn on the burner, and adjust the heat to “high.” Keep it there and wait for the water to reach a rolling boil. [2] X Research source Make sure your stock pot sits sturdily on the burner. Hot wax is dangerous, so you’ll want to prevent it from accidentally getting knocked over. Since water boils at 212 °F (100 °C), using a double boiler will make it difficult for the wax to exceed this temperature and reach its flashpoint. This keeps you safe and prevents any fires or accidents."

Set these chunks into the small metal bowl or saucepan that you’re going to place over the larger pot. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Nest the smaller bowl inside the larger stock pot. First, reduce the heat to “medium” or “medium-high” to keep the water going at a steady simmer. [4] X Research source Next, place the smaller bowl or saucepan on top of the larger stock pot to form your double boiler. Rest the edge of the bowl or the handle of the saucepan on the lip of the larger stock pot to ensure that it doesn’t touch the bottom. You don’t want to directly expose the beeswax to the heat source, as this can cause the wax to overheat, become scorched, or even cause a fire."

      "content": "Allow the solid beeswax to melt slowly over the simmering water. Constantly monitor the beeswax as it melts. After about 2 to 3 minutes, you’ll start to notice the wax beginning to liquify. Depending on how much wax you're melting and how large the pieces are, you may have to wait anywhere from 10 minutes to an hour for it to completely melt. [5] X Research source Feel free to use a thermometer to monitor the temperature of your beeswax as it melts. It should melt around 144 to 150 °F (62 to 66 °C). Don’t allow it to exceed 170 °F (77 °C), as it will get discolored and lose its aroma past this point. For your safety, never leave the beeswax unattended as it melts. Keep an eye on the water level, too. If it begins to evaporate away, pour more water into the stockpot periodically. Don’t let the double boiler to become completely dry at any point during the process."

Once every piece of solid beeswax melts away, remove it from the heat and immediately pour it into the molds. Melted beeswax can start to solidify pretty quickly once it’s removed from the heat, so you’ll need to act quickly. [6] X Research source If there are any large particles in the wax, try pouring it through a cheesecloth or coffee filter to strain them out. Use care when handling the hot wax. Wear oven gloves to protect your hands from the hot steam and any splashes of wax. If you’re pouring the hot wax into a glass container, make sure it is heat resistant, so it doesn’t crack."

Make sure that the bowl is tall enough that water won’t seep in, but not so tall that you can’t close the lid of the crock pot. If you’re melting beeswax to make homemade candles, you may be able to use your candle containers for this. Just make sure you’re using metal or heat-resistant glass, so it won’t shatter or crack. [7] X Research source It’s also possible to melt the beeswax directly in the basin of the crock pot without creating a water bath, since the temperature can remain low. If you choose to do this, line the crockpot with aluminum foil to prevent the beeswax from sticking. However, using a water bath is preferable if possible, since it protects the wax from direct heat and makes pouring the liquid wax much easier. [8] X Research source"

Depending on how much wax you’re melting, plan to wait at least 1 hour for it to fully liquify.

[11] X Research source Make sure to use oven gloves as you handle the hot bowl to protect your hands from the steam and splashes of hot wax. Filter the wax to remove large particles before pouring it in the mold. You can pour the liquified wax through a cheesecloth or a coffee filter to achieve this.

Find a spot outside that will receive direct sunlight for most of the day, and place your covered solar oven there. Check on the progress of your melting wax every 20 to 30 minutes, and reposition it to keep it away from shade or moisture if needed. Start this process earlier in the day to take advantage of direct midday sun. By the end of the day, you should have a bowl of melted wax.

[19] X Research source Because it’s much easier to overheat beeswax in the microwave, it’s best to avoid this method. The slower, gentler heating processes of double boiling, creating a water bath in a crock pot, or making a solar oven are safer options."
