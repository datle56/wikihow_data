If the owner of the hacked account can no longer sign in, they'll need to report the incident at https://www.facebook.com/hacked to reclaim their account. [1] X Research source Once Facebook confirms the hack, you can continue with this method. This method will only work if you once had admin rights to a Page but were removed by someone who hacked another admin's account. If the person in control of the Page has never given you access, see this method instead."

To do this, go to your page, click Manage at the top-right, click Page Access in the left panel, click the three dots next to your name, then click Remove access . [2] X Research source"

[3] X Research source This will only work if you were previously an admin for the Page and have spent money advertising for the Page, as chat won't be available otherwise. Begin by preparing these documents: An official government ID for the person requesting Admin access. An official business document containing the owner's name and address, such as a utility bill, tax document, business license, or certificate of formation. [4] X Research source A written letter (you can type and print it out, but you'll need to sign it by hand) containing this information: The name and URL of the Page The requester's relationship to the Page The requester's name, email address, and personal Facebook profile URL An explanation of the request. For example, \"The current administrator, (name), was terminated by our company on X date and has not returned control of the Facebook Page.
