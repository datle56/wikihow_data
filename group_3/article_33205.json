Assassin—This character is the 2nd highest DPS (damage per second) class and can use two weapons (dual wield). Black Knight—The Knight class possesses great defense with decent attack damage. They're able to use skills that can summon swords, which is great in inflicting damage. This class is ideal for new players. Priest—This is the best healing class with great single-target stun. Priests are able to put groups of enemies to sleep, a good strategy especially when you have a mage in your party. Ranger—This is a range class with support skills such as healing. This class can also summon a bear, which can be played as the attacker or tank for the party. Warlock—This class has the highest DPS because of its high speed attack, which sends damage through the roof, great for slowing enemies, making them an easy target for the rest of your party. Moreover, Warlocks can wear Plate Mail, which increases their defense. Warrior—Warrior is a great tank and damage class with stun skills. A mixture between the Knight and Assassin since this class can duel wield weapons."

      "content": "Go through the tutorial. At the start of the game, after choosing the class of your preference, a scene will occur, showing you the story of your character before taking a long journey. In this part of the sequence, the game will teach you how to move and attack. The controls is pretty basic, so it’s easy to learn. On the lower left of your screen, you will be able to see an arrow pad similar to any handheld console. Sliding your hand over it will make your character to move up, down, left, and right. On the right side of your screen is where you control the attack. Tapping the pad on that side will make your character to swing their sword or cast magic to the enemy."

      "content": "Buy a Bag. Buy the max amount of 12 slot bags as early as possible. Having enough space in your inventory for items is important in the later part of the game, especially when you need to do heavy mob leveling. Going back to the city just to clear your inventory for more space is dreadful. There's not much to spending money in the early levels of the game, and the extra space will let you pick up everything and even store enough potions for survival. This technique works well until level 70."

      "title": "Use the dice.",
      "content": "Use the dice. Dices are found randomly from battles or treasure boxes. You should roll dices as soon as possible as dices are a great way to raise all your stat points. When you roll a dice, it will randomly re-adjust your current stats. If you don't like what is rolled, you can choose to keep your current stat set up."

      "content": "Get a decent team. In Inotia 4, you can hire up to two members to join your party. They will help you in taking care of the monsters and even give support such as healing and buffs. The best party so far is with a Priest, Ranger, or Warlock. With this kind of setup, monsters die quickly and the chance of survival is high. Priests can stand as the healer of the group, Warlock will be the damage dealer, and Ranger will be the all-around class. Rangers have offensive and supportive skills, which is useful whenever the Priest has run out of energy."
