Some states may call the regulating agency the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV), the Registry of Motor Vehicles (RMV), the Department of Transportation (DOT), the Motor Vehicle Bureau, or some other similar name. Do a quick Internet search for the name of your state and “car registration,” and you should find the information you need to get to their website. For example, if you live in California, you will find the website for the California Department of Motor Vehicles at www.dmv.ca.gov.

      "content": "Find out about your deadline. When you move into a new state, you generally must register your car in the new state within a certain time frame. This may be as short as 30 days or less. [4] X Research source For example, the website for the Washington State Department of Licensing says that you must register your car in the state within 30 days of moving. In many states, you must get a new driver’s license within your new home state either as part of registering the car or before you can register the car."

      "content": "Gather the information and documents you will need to register your vehicle. Each state will have different requirements for registering your vehicle. When you find the website for your new DMV, you should be able to find a list of requirements for registration. Some of the most common requirements include the following: Your identification. You will need to demonstrate some government-issued identification that shows that you match the owner of the vehicle. This may be your driver’s license, passport, or some other state-issued identification card. Proof of ownership. You will most definitely need to provide some proof that you are the owner of the vehicle. This is most likely going to be the Title Certificate, although you may be able to present your registration from your previous state. If you still owe money on a loan, the lender probably is holding the certificate of title. You will at least want to check with the DMV on how to proceed in this case. You can probably get a certificate or statement from the lien holder to verify title ownership. [5] X Research source Odometer disclosure statement. In some states, you merely need to provide the odometer reading on your own. In other states, you may need to take your vehicle to a state-approved location and have an odometer reading certified. [6] X Research source Emissions disclosure statement. Several states, most notably California, require that your car must pass an emissions test before you can register it. Even if you passed such a test in your prior state, you must get a new certification if you move into California. [7] X Research source Bill of sale. Particularly if you have purchased your car recently, you may need to show some extra proof of purchase."

Your insurance company may have a simple form or certificate that they can send you. You may need to have a particular DMV form stamped by your insurance company. Plan ahead, because getting this paperwork may take a few days."

In some states, you may need a cursory safety inspection, while other states will require a multi-stage inspection that includes both vehicle operation and emissions or smog certification. Find out your state’s requirements and leave yourself enough time to get it done. When your car passes each stage of the inspection, you should get a certificate of some sort. Make sure that you have this available for the registration."

If this is not a possibility, you would then need to visit the DMV office to get a registration application form. In either case, make sure that you get the correct form. The form that you need to register a vehicle that is coming in from another state might be different than the form for registering a newly purchased vehicle. If you have questions, call the DMV to ask. For example, if you are registering a vehicle in California, you will need their Form REG 343, which is titled, “Application for Title or Registration.”"

In some states, a single form will be used for multiple purposes. For example, if you are moving into New York and wish to register your vehicle, the form you use is titled, “Vehicle Registration/Title Application.” The same form is used to register your vehicle, renew or change a registration, replace a lost or damaged registration, title certificate or license plates, get a title, or transfer your license plates.

You will also need to provide the vehicle’s complete Vehicle Identification Number (VIN). Be careful to provide this accurately. If you make mistakes on the application form, your final registration may include errors. These can be difficult to correct later.

In other states, you may be able to begin the process online, but then take care of the rest with a briefer DMV visit. For example, in New York you can use the “E-Z Visit” service. This service will let you begin your application online. As a result, this will reduce the time you need to spend at the registry office. As another example, Pennsylvania will let you renew your registration online, as long as you meet certain qualifications. You will want to check your own state’s site to learn your options."

You will want to find the one that is closest or most convenient to you. Some states also allow you to make appointments online. This would reduce your waiting time when you go to register your vehicle. For example, the Nevada Department of Motor Vehicles has an interactive map of the state that illustrates the DMV office locations. When you select the one nearest you, a pop-up box provides you with the address, telephone number and hours of operation for that office. You can also click on a link for directions.

You may not be able to plan for the exact amount of the registration fee. Call the office to find out what options you may have for payment. Most DMV offices will accept cash, checks, money orders or credit cards. You should find out which forms are accepted in your new state and try to estimate the amount you will need to pay. For example, the Nevada DMV provides a link on its website for a fee estimate. If you provide your vehicle’s VIN, make, model and year, the link can give you an estimate of the registration fee. Be aware that even this link is only an estimate, and the final fee will not be set until you visit the DMV office. [12] X Research source"
