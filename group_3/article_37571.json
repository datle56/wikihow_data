      "title": "Collect your dried up Play-Doh in a bowl.",
      "content": "Collect your dried up Play-Doh in a bowl. Keep the same colors together to prevent the Play-Doh dyes from mixing and forming a brownish color. Play-Doh is mostly made of flour, water, and salt, so adding life back to the hardened dough can be as simple as adding back the water that’s evaporated. If your Play-Doh has been out for an extended period of time (more than a couple months) and has fully hardened, it may not be possible to revive it."

      "content": "Sprinkle the Play-Doh with water. Massage the wet ball in your hands, working the water into the dough. Continue sprinkling the ball with water and massaging it."

      "content": "Knead the ball. Once the dough has absorbed a sufficient amount of water and has become moist and malleable again, knead it on a countertop for a few minutes, until it has returned to its original form. Sprinkle it with more water as you’re kneading, if necessary. Try kneading one-half teaspoon of glycerine into the Play-Doh to help moisten it further. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Flatten the Play-Doh.",
      "content": "Flatten the Play-Doh. In your hands or on a counter, flatten the dough ball to increase the absorption area. Keep in mind that you’ll be putting this in a steamer, so don’t make it too large."

      "content": "Break the Play-Doh into pea-sized bits. The smaller the pieces, the easier it will be to rehydrate them. Put the pieces into a strainer and run water over them so that all the pieces are coated. Let sit for a minute to let any excess water drain off."

      "content": "Remove the pieces from the bag. Once the dough has had time to rest and absorb the water, put the pieces in a bowl and press them back into a single ball of dough. Wrap the ball with a wet cloth or paper towel and return it to the bag. Seal and leave it overnight."

Sometimes dried out Play-Doh is too far gone to rehydrate, but making your own is a fun and inexpensive way to replace it, and it’s so easy that even the kids can help. To make playdough, you will need: 2 ½ cups of water 1 ¼ cups of salt 1 ½ tablespoons of cream of tartar 5 tablespoons of vegetable oil 2 ½ cups of flour Food coloring"
