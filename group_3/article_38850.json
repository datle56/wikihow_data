[6] X Expert Source Guy Reichard Executive Life Coach Expert Interview. 13 March 2020. For example, let’s say one of your goals is to “become a surgeon.” Why is this something you want?

Writing down your goals puts them in perspective and can even help you visualize them. Plus, science proves that there’s a greater chance that you’ll remember and accomplish your goals if you write them down.

Writing improves this process, making it easier to remember things long-term."

Create a list that ranks all of your life goals from least to most important. Assess your personal commitment to each goal. You’re less likely to achieve long-term goals you’re only somewhat committed to, especially if other goals on your list are much more important.

Consider what you need to do step-by-step to achieve your overall goal. Then, work towards accomplishing each of these subgoals. [12] X Research source Make these subgoals as measurable and tangible as possible. In other words, there should be a clear definition of each subgoal that makes it easy to tell when you have achieved it. For example, if your goal is to open a restaurant, your subgoals might include saving up a certain amount of money, finding a location, designing the interior, getting it furnished, obtaining insurance, getting various permits and licenses, hiring employees, and finally, having a grand opening. Executive coach Jessica Elliot explains that “small incremental steps are always a better choice. You may feel like you are not getting anywhere, but by doing a few things every day, you’re adding to your overall larger goal.” [13] X Expert Source Jessica Elliott, ACC, CEC Certified Executive Coach Expert Interview. 12 February 2020."

Think about how long each subgoal might take and create a timeline for achieving them. Just remember to plan for obstacles and setbacks. While they’re not ideal, they’re bound to happen. [15] X Research source Having deadlines will keep you motivated by adding a sense of urgency and accountability. Thinking in advance about obstacles you might encounter will help you develop ideas for how to deal with them if they come up. For example, if you want to open a restaurant and have at least $10,000 saved in 3 years, you can break that down to saving around $278 a month. To plan for obstacles, you might save $300 or $400 some months just in case you hit financial hardships and miss a month of saving."

If you live with friends who party all the time and encourage you to do the same, you might need to set clearer boundaries .
