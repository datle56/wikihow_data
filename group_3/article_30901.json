      "content": "Cut the bottom. Make sure you cut the bottom and if you have anything hanging out, like a stringed piece of husk or a kernel, pull/cut it off. Make sure you have a perfect cut, and don't remove too much of the actual sweet corn!"

      "title": "Slip it from the husk.",
      "content": "Slip it from the husk. You don't need to pull each individual piece of husk off, just place your thumb and index finger at the top, making sure you're close to a tabletop, and a tea towel is underneath, to prevent the corn from being crushed, bruised or juiced, and squeeze lightly, and working your index finger and thumb down along with the corn. Don't force it, though. Make sure it comes out of the end you cut!"
