Read this wikiHow article to get rid of leaks. Remove the washer from under your cabinets to see where the water is coming from; if you just replaced a sink drain, the P-trap under your sink can cause water to backflow and flood your dishwasher. In that case, use a bucket to clean the P-trap so water can flow normally. Check your hoses for any visible damage. Give sitting water time to dissipate or use a towel to dry the area. Using too much detergent for your dishwasher can also cause the blinking error; use less detergent in the future to avoid excessive foaming which can cause leaks."
