The tape you use to cover the notch should be just large enough to cover it—don't use too much tape, or else it could prevent the SD card from seating properly. [1] X Research source If the unlock switch keeps falling down, you can use another small piece of tape to keep it in the unlocked position. If you still can't write to the card after covering the notch with tape, try inserting it into a computer and checking for digital write protection. Read on to learn how on Windows and macOS."
