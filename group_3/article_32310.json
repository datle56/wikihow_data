If the light is orange, they need to be charged more until they can pair with another device. If one of your earbuds stops working, there are a few things you can do. First, uninstall your Google app (the app logo looks like a \"G\"), then go to the Play Store and update the app you just uninstalled. Next, delete or forget the pairing connection from your phone to your Pixel Buds. Finally, put the Buds back in their case with the lid open and reset them (press and hold the button on the back of the case for about 30 seconds, and the light on the case should be blinking white and orange, then pulse white). After the Buds reset, pair them with your phone again. [2] X Research source"
