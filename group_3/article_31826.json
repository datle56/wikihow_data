      "title": "Find a seat.",
      "content": "Find a seat. It's probably a better idea to find a seat before you get your food. This is because if all the seats are full after you've collected your food, you're going to have to either eat standing up or walk around looking for a seat for quite some time. Also, some restaurants send waiters to your table, so it's required that you find a seat. At some restaurants, there will be a hostess who will direct you to your seat."
    },
    {
      "title": "Look at the menu.",
      "content": "Look at the menu. The menu should already be on your table but if it's not, or there are not enough menus for everyone, ask a member of staff for one. The menu includes everything that the restaurant sells and also states their prices. Have a look and see if anything interests you then decide what you're going to buy."
    },
    {
      "title": "Call the waiter over.",
      "content": "Call the waiter over. This can be done by simply getting a passing waiter's attention or waiting until they come to you. Once they arrive, tell them what you'd like to eat. Make sure that they've written down the correct foods so you don't end up with something that you didn't want. Never click your fingers to get their attention, the waiter will find it very rude and offensive. Remember that they are normal people with jobs, not your slaves."
    },
    {
      "title": "Wait for your food.",
      "content": "Wait for your food. At some restaurants, they cook the food from scratch as soon as they get your order. This means that it might take some time for your food to get to you. Just be patient , your food should arrive in under half an hour. If it hasn't arrived, tell someone. They may have forgotten about your order, or it might just be a busy day."

      "title": "Enjoy!",
      "content": "Enjoy!"

    {
      "title": "Decide where you'd like to eat.",
      "content": "Decide where you'd like to eat. This all depends on what you fancy. Are you hungry for a burger? Or would you rather order from your local kebab shop? As long as the shop does deliveries, you can pretty much order whatever you like."
    },
    {
      "title": "Find their phone number.",
      "content": "Find their phone number. You can usually do this by going to their website or searching for their phone number online. If the shop is local, they will usually post flyers through the door. If they don't have a website, you can also look at one of these flyers to find their number."

      "title": "Give them a ring.",
      "content": "Give them a ring. They might not answer straight away if they're busy but just do your best to stay patient ."
    },
    {
      "title": "Place your order.",
      "content": "Place your order. To do this, tell them what you'd like to eat. They will usually ask for your address so they know where to deliver the food and sometimes your name. Make sure that they confirm your order so you don't end up with the wrong foods at your door."
    },
    {
      "title": "Wait for your delivery.",
      "content": "Wait for your delivery. Depending on where you live and where you ordered from, the time you'll have to wait can vary. Usually though, you shouldn't be kept waiting for over half an hour. If you're still waiting, phone them up again and confirm that your order has been delivered. They may have forgotten about it or not finished cooking it yet."
    },
    {
      "title": "Pay the delivery person.",
      "content": "Pay the delivery person. Some people give small tips to the delivery person. This is optional but they'll appreciate it a lot. If you'd like to give a small tip, tell them to just keep the change."
