      "content": "Pull out the sail flaps on the bottom side of the windows. The bottom flaps of the windows are tucked into a shallow section of the vehicle exterior. Pull on the edges of the sail flaps gently to remove them from the sides of your vehicles. [2] X Research source Keep your windows flat since they are plastic and could easily bend. Store the windows vertically behind your back seats to keep them in your vehicle and out of the way."

      "title": "Roll up the back window to save time.",
      "content": "Roll up the back window to save time. Unzip the left and right sides of the back window, leaving the top attached. Tightly wrap the window towards the interior of the vehicles until you reach the top. Snap the rolled window with elastic bands to secure it.

      "content": "Remove the back window entirely for a clean look. Unzip the back window fully and pull up on the bottom bar. This will loosen the back window so it can be taken off of your jeep completely. Store the window in a flat area so it doesn’t get scratched or bent. [4] X Research source Keep the rear window behind the back seats of your jeep for easy storage."

You’ll see a black latch above the driver and passenger sides of the jeep. Pull the latches towards you to undo them. [5] X Research source You can undo the latches before or after you remove the windows. If you only want to open the top above the front seats, undo the latches and flip the top back."

Once the top is all the way down and in line with the swing gate on the back, use Velcro straps to keep it secured. [9] X Research source"
