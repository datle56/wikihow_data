      "title": "Read the instructions.",
      "content": "Read the instructions. Before you begin using a cleaning agent on the shoes whose soles you wish to re-ice, ensure that the compound is compatible with your shoe. The instructions on the product’s use label should indicate which shoes or shoe materials it can be used with. [1] X Research source If you do not see your shoes’ brand or shoe material listed on the cleaning agent’s label, reach out to the customer service department of the shoe company that manufactured your shoes and/or the manufacturer of the product you intend to use to re-ice your soles. Ask them if the product is acceptable for the shoes you wish to re-ice."

      "title": "Wash and clean your shoe soles.",
      "content": "Wash and clean your shoe soles. Use a damp, soapy cloth, to wipe the sole down. Be sure to work the cloth into the cracks and crevices of the sole. This will prepare your soles to receive the cleaning agent. If your sole is particularly grimy, you could utilize a specialized shoe cleaning product and a stiff bristled brush to clean your shoe sole. Follow up by using a sponge with a dish scrubber to wipe away any remaining grime."

      "title": "Create paper cutouts of the areas you don’t wish to re-ice.",
      "content": "Create paper cutouts of the areas you don’t wish to re-ice. Your shoe sole probably includes some areas that do not need to be re-iced. These areas include the rubber traction pads and the carbon fiber portion of the shoe (often located near the inside of the heel). These cutouts will reduce the surface temperature of the sole when it is exposed to sunlight later. To make the cutouts for these areas, place a piece of paper over the shoe’s sole. Trace around the area that you do not wish to re-ice. Cut around the area that you traced."

      "title": "Apply the re-icing agent to the sole of the shoe.",
      "content": "Apply the re-icing agent to the sole of the shoe. Most of the time, you can simply squirt a bit of the re-icing agent out and onto the yellowed sole. Using a paintbrush, spread the re-icing agent across the area of the sole that requires re-icing. Ensure the product is distributed evenly in a coat of medium thickness across the area of the sole you wish to re-ice. [2] X Research source Alternately, you could pour a bit of the re-icing agent into a small bowl or, better yet, a disposable container like a Styrofoam takeout container or clean yogurt container. Then, dip the paintbrush in the re-icing agent and apply it to the sole as needed. As much as possible, avoid getting the re-icing agent on other parts of the shoe."

    {
      "title": "Apply the paper cutouts.",
      "content": "Apply the paper cutouts. Once you’re done applying the re-icing agent to the shoe, apply the paper cutouts you made earlier. Roll a piece of tape up so that it is sticky on all sides. Stick this tape to the paper you cut out and press it into the corresponding area. These paper cutouts will help the bottom of your shoe maintain a low temperature as you re-ice the sole."

    {
      "title": "Wrap the sole with plastic wrap.",
      "content": "Wrap the sole with plastic wrap. The best way to do this is to wrap all or most of the shoe in plastic wrap. Tuck excess cling wrap into the hole where your foot enters the shoe. Wrapping your shoe in plastic wrap will prevent the re-icing agent from evaporating when exposed to sunlight. It will also prevent the re-icing agent from dripping down the sides of the shoe too much."

    {
      "title": "Place your shoe in the sun with its sole facing up.",
      "content": "Place your shoe in the sun with its sole facing up. The best way to do this is to place a water bottle in a position perpendicular to the upside-down shoe so that the bottle supports the toe of the shoe. Alternately, if you are not re-icing both shoes at once, you could place the shoe’s counterpart in the position opposite it. In this way, the toes of the shoe you are re-icing will sit atop the toes of the other shoe in the pair. [3] X Research source If you’re in an area with little sunlight or if the weather is foul and you cannot leave your shoes outside, you can place the shoes beneath a UVB light."

      "title": "Monitor your sole’s temperature.",
      "content": "Monitor your sole’s temperature. The best time to place your shoes outside is typically early in the morning before the temperature rises too high. If your shoe sole’s temperature rises to 120 degrees Fahrenheit (49 degrees Celsius) or more, bring your shoe inside. Use an infrared temperature gauge to identify the temperature of the shoe sole. There is no schedule according to which you must conform when re-icing your soles. If the temperature remains within the acceptable range, you can leave your shoe out in the sun as long as you’d like. The acceptable temperature range is below 120 degrees Fahrenheit (49 degrees Celsius). Should your shoe exceed the acceptable temperature range, bring it inside. The longer you leave the shoe out, the more iciness will be recovered. You must use an infrared temperature gauge to monitor the temperature of the shoe sole. Directions for use vary according to the infrared temperature gauge you use. Generally, you will need to turn the infrared temperature gauge on, then aim it at the shoe and check the gauge’s digital readout. Consult manufacturer directions for more information."

      "title": "Clean the sole off.",
      "content": "Clean the sole off. Remove and discard the cling wrap, then remove and discard the paper cutouts. Turn your sink faucet on, allowing just a trickle of warm water to come out. Move an old toothbrush through the water stream, then use it to scrub away the re-icing agent. Try not to get the upper or mid-sole wet. Hold the shoe at a slight tilt so that the water drips off the shoe rather than running down the sides. Be sure to work the brush around all the cracks and crevices of the tread."

      "title": "Take the wrapping paper from the shoebox.",
      "content": "Take the wrapping paper from the shoebox. The wrapping paper that shoes are packaged with is slightly acidic. Over time, it will cause your icy soles to yellow. If you keep your shoes in your shoebox, remove this packaging paper."

      "title": "Store your shoes with silica packets.",
      "content": "Store your shoes with silica packets. Silica gel packets are commonly packaged with shoes and other products in order to control humidity and absorb moisture. They can also prevent your icy soles from yellowing. Instead of keeping your shoes by the door, place your icy-soled shoes in a shoebox with a few small silica gel packets (or one large silica gel packet). Do not put more than four small packs or one large packet in a single shoe box."

      "title": "Keep your shoes in a cool, dark place.",
      "content": "Keep your shoes in a cool, dark place. If shoes are put through dramatic temperature changes (hot summers, cold winters), the material they are made from will become stressed and could turn yellow or start to crack. After removing the paper from the shoebox they came in, store your shoes in the box and store them in your closet or in your basement – wherever you believe the climate in your home will be most stable."
