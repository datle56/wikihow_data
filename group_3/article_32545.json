A gua sha tool is a rounded tool made of a smooth material like wood, stone, plastic, stainless steel, or jade. Some gua sha tools look like smooth stones, while others are more elaborate and have handles. [3] X Research source If you don’t want to purchase a tool, you can use an edge of a spoon instead.

Typically gua sha is performed on the back, shoulders, hips, or back of the neck, but you can perform it wherever you feel pain. Rub over your sore muscle with your fingers and locate the area where the muscle feels stiff or tense. [5] X Research source Do not use gua sha to relieve pain in your joints or along your spine."

      "content": "Continue scraping the sore muscle until it turns red. As you rub over the sore muscle, capillaries under your skin will break and create what's known as petechia, which looks like small red dots under your skin. Don’t be alarmed; this is normal and will go away in a couple of days.

      "content": "Have a friend help if you can’t reach your stiff muscles. To perform gua sha on yourself, you’ll need to be able to reach the spot that is tender or sore. Areas like the middle and lower back and back of the arms can be hard to reach. If these are the muscles that are sore, have a friend do the gua sha on you instead of doing it yourself."
