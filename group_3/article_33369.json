Six sea frame pieces. 18 circular number tokens. A black/grey robber pawn. Four sets of wooden player pieces in four different colors each containing five settlements, four cities, and 15 roads. 25 development cards consisting of 14 knight/soldier cards, 6 progress cards, and 5 victory points. Resource cards of each terrain hex except for the desert. Four building costs cards, one for each player. \"Longest Road\" and \"Largest Army\" award cards. Two dice, one red, one yellow. Extra harbor pieces for placement of random harbors (optional)."

Each special card is worth two victory points. The \"Longest Road\" card will be awarded to the first person to successfully build a continuous five roads. The card will switch hands whenever a player's number of connecting roads surpasses the longest continuous road of the cardholder. The \"Largest Army\" card will be awarded to the first person to play three \"Knight\" cards.

A variation on this way of laying out the hexes is to place all of the hexes face down. They may only be turned upwards when someone places a road or a settlement on that hex. [4] X Research source"

You also get more resource cards if you have more than one settlement bordering a hex.

Some other strategies include: Setting yourself up to build roads and settlements by aiming for lots of brick and wood hexes in the beginning. Monopolizing ports. Try to get a port and at least two cities on different hexes with the same resource, so that you can trade for whatever you need. Targeting the winning player(s) with the robber and Knight cards. Robbing your opponents can keep them from progressing too much while also gaining yourself some extra resources. Building cities (and settlements) as soon as you can. When you have lots of resources to work with, you'll be able to trade and build easily."

Keep a running total of your points as you play the game so that you don’t surpass 10 points without noticing.
