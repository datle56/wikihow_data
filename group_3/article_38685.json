      "content": "Check your local laws for pet selling requirements. Many towns and cities regulate pet sales. Do an online search for \"pet sales in\" with the name of the city or town where you live and see what comes up. Look for an official government site that you can rely on. [1] X Research source If your online search isn't turning up anything, talk to your vet—they likely have a good idea of the local laws or can connect you with someone who does. Some local laws require you to apply for a permit before you can sell an animal. Although there might be an exception if you're not a breeder and are only selling one dog, it's still worth looking into to make sure. [2] X Research source Regulations might require you to include specific information in your ad or restrict places where a sale can be completed. All of this is good information to know beforehand!"

      "content": "Review the puppy or adoption contract if you signed one. If you adopted your dog from a rescue or bought it from a breeder, you might have been required to sign one of these contracts. Puppy and adoption contracts often require you to return the dog to the original breeder or rescue if it isn't a good fit for your home. [3] X Research source If you have one of these contracts, read it carefully. There might be an age restriction on the requirement for you to return the dog. It's a good idea to contact the breeder or rescue where you got the dog if you signed a contract—regardless of what the specific text of the contract says. They might be willing to take the dog back and save you a lot of hassle."

      "content": "Write down basic information about your dog. It's possible that you'll be making multiple advertisements, so it helps to have all of this information handy. Your local laws might require you to include specific information in your advertisement, but at a minimum, you'll need at least the following: [4] X Research source Name Breed Age Sex Registration information or ID numbers, if applicable Health information Personality and temperament Training Requirements and limitations"

      "content": "Take pictures or make videos of your dog. Photos draw people's eyes to your advertisement and make them fall in love with your dog. Get your dog groomed before the photos so it looks its best. Then pick a background and atmosphere that showcases your dog's personality and what makes it unique. [5] X Research source If you're planning to post advertisements online, such as on social media, videos help prospective buyers see a little of your dog's personality or any tricks it does. You can also show off how well-trained your dog is."

      "content": "Calculate the total price for the dog ahead of time. Add up any costs that you want to figure into the price, such as food, veterinary bills, or registration fees. Include everything so your potential buyers understand the costs upfront. Many scams start with one price, then keep requesting additional money for other things. [7] X Trustworthy Source Federal Trade Commission Website with up-to-date information for consumers from the Federal Trade Commisson Go to source A breakdown of these costs will also help potential buyers understand why you set the price how you did, so they'll be less inclined to haggle with you. For example, if you've set your price at $600, you might list $100 for food and supplies that will go with the dog, $350 for veterinary expenses to get the dog ready for adoption, and $150 for grooming expenses. As a service, you might also include information about how much you spend each month on food, supplies, care, and upkeep of the dog. This helps potential owners evaluate if they're financially able to care for the dog over the long term."

      "content": "Make a post on your social media accounts. Social media platforms are a great way to get the word out that you want to sell a dog. Restrict your posts to your friends and followers (at least at first) so you can control who sees the post. [8] X Trustworthy Source The Humane Society of the United States National organization devoted to the promotion of animal welfare Go to source A friend might ask you to make your post public so they can share it more widely. If they do, use your best judgment. You might want to remove some information that you wouldn't want to share with the general public. Talk to friends and family you know and trust—especially if you're trying to sell a dog that has been a beloved pet. You can be sure that they'll treat your dog well, so they should be your first choice to take it. If you're selling puppies from an unexpected litter, start advertising them and talking them up early—you can get new owners lined up for most of them before they're even weaned."

Include a photo along with information about your dog and a way to contact you. [9] X Research source The benefit of these flyers is that they'll attract the attention of local people who are already animal lovers and likely already have pets. If your dog doesn't do well with other animals, though, this might not be the best option for you. To protect your privacy, create a free email address that you'll use for all inquiries about the dog. You can include that email address on your flyers without worry."

      "content": "Put up an ad on an online marketplace as a last resort. There are many online marketplaces that host ads selling pets. The biggest problem with these marketplaces is that you have no control over who sees and responds to your ad. Because scams are prevalent, you have to use extreme caution. [10] X Trustworthy Source Animal Humane Society Leading animal welfare nonprofit organization providing medical care, training education, and resources for animal owners Go to source Before you use a commercial online marketplace, check the websites of local humane societies and shelters. Many have their own forums that are more secure than online marketplaces and cater to locals. There are online marketplaces where you can advertise litters of puppies, but the most secure ones are restricted to registered breeders. If you're not a registered breeder, you're better off selling your puppies locally."

Here are some questions you might include: [11] X Research source Have you owned a dog before? Do you currently own any dogs or other pets? If so, list them along with their age and breed/size.

A prospective buyer who currently has pets and refuses to give you even the name and phone number of their veterinarian should give you pause. If you're selling an adult dog with potential health issues, that's definitely a red flag."

      "content": "Sign contracts transferring ownership of your dog. Written contracts are important to protect your interests, the buyer's interests, and the interests of the dog. Because animal law can be pretty specific, it's a good idea to have an attorney draft your contract for you or at least look over one you've prepared yourself. If money's tight, though, you can find plenty of sample contracts online that you can use. [16] X Research source Make sure your contract includes requirements that the new owners comply with all local regulations regarding pet ownership, such as vaccinations and leash laws. If your dog is microchipped , include a clause about keeping it up to date. You might also include a clause in the contract that requires the new owners to return the dog to you if they find they can't take care of it. If your dog has a registered pedigree, you might be able to transfer ownership of that pedigree registration online. For example, the American Kennel Club (AKC) has an online transfer option for AKC-registered dogs .
