      "content": "Determine your variety and only prune indeterminate tomatoes. According to edible gardening expert Erin Hostetler, “you don’t want to prune determinate tomatoes...because you [reduce] your yields by doing that.” Determinate tomatoes only grow to a certain height and are more compact, while indeterminate tomatoes keep growing throughout the season and are more vine-like. [1] X Research source Here are some common varieties of each: Indeterminate: Beefsteak, Big Boy, Brandywine, Sungold, Sweet Million, Cherokee Purple, and most cherry, heirloom, and dwarf varieties. Determinate: Roma, Rutgers, Early Girl, Patio, Zebra Cherry, Celebrity, San Marzano Nano, Amish Paste, Marglobe, Amelia, Better Bush, Heinz Classic, and Mountain Pride."

      "title": "Remove all suckers below the first flower cluster.",
      "content": "Remove all suckers below the first flower cluster. A “sucker” is a tiny branch sprouting between the main stalk of the tomato plant and an established branch, usually growing at a 45° angle from the plant. If the sucker is less than 2 inches long, you can simply grab the base between your thumb and forefinger and pinch it off. If it’s longer, use sanitized garden shears to make a clean cut as close to the main stem as possible. [2] X Research source It’s best to remove suckers when they’re small. Once the suckers grow thicker than a pencil, they will leave a large wound behind when removed. [3] X Research source You want to remove all the suckers below the lowest flower cluster so they don’t take away energy from fruit production. Removing the suckers ensures that most of the nutrients are sent to the fruits, instead of being wasted on the growing tips. [4] X Research source If you live in a warmer zone, however, follow the “Missouri pruning” method and pinch off the leaflets on the end of each sucker, leaving the 2 base leaflets in place. They can help shade the fruit and prevent sunscald."

      "title": "Leave up to 4 suckers on the tomato plant to increase your yield (optional).",
      "content": "Leave up to 4 suckers on the tomato plant to increase your yield (optional). If you have the space and support for a multi-vine system, you can keep a few suckers higher up on your plant. These suckers will act as secondary stems to support more growth and fruit. [5] X Research source Generally, people keep 1-2 thicker suckers near the top of their plant, but you can leave up to 4 suckers—any more than that will yield smaller fruit. If you decide to keep a sucker, treat it like a second main stem. Prune its own suckers regularly and make sure it's supported with a stake or tie."

      "title": "Trim lower leaves that touch the ground to prevent disease.",
      "content": "Trim lower leaves that touch the ground to prevent disease. Removing the lower 6-12 inches of leaves can prevent blight and soil-borne diseases from splashing onto your plant when raindrops hit the ground. [6] X Research source Just bend each leaf upwards and then downwards until you hear a soft snap. If the leaves only bend and do not snap, use a sharp knife or pruning shears to cut them off close to the stem. [7] X Research source If you live in a warmer zone, you can keep some lower leaves on your plant to shade the ground and prevent sunscald. Just remove damaged or yellow leaves, as well as leaves that touch the soil. If your plant is in a humid environment, such as a greenhouse, remove everything below the first flower cluster to improve ventilation. Humidity can make it easier for sicknesses to flourish, plus cause the wounds created while pruning to dry up more slowly, making the plant vulnerable. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Top your plant about 30 days before the first expected frost. To speed up ripening of the remaining fruit, you need to “top” your plant, or remove the growing tips of each main stem. This forces your plant to stop making flowers and redirect its energy into growing larger fruit. Just take clean gardening shears and cut right above the flower cluster. [9] X Research source"

      "content": "Start pruning when the plant is 12-18 inches tall. Wait for the first tomato flowers to open and for the plant to be established. This usually happens in late June or early July. During the first 6 weeks, you may need to prune the suckers once or twice a week since they grow quickly. [10] X Research source Afterwards, continue pruning every 10-14 days. [11] X Research source Stop pruning 1-2 weeks before your first harvest so the plant can produce canopies that protect its fruits from sunscald."

      "title": "Pruning improves airflow and increases your fruit production.",
      "content": "Pruning improves airflow and increases your fruit production. Pruning allows your plant to “put energy into a way that it can be most productive,” says Hostetler. Removing extra growth forces your plant to focus on producing larger, healthier tomatoes, which also helps the fruit ripen more quickly. Getting rid of dense, crowded leaves in the center of the plant also improves airflow and prevents diseases, such as blight and mildew. [12] X Research source You can also “strategically prune horizontal growth on the plants to increase airflow, which increases fruit production, and overall health,” says Hostetler."

      "content": "It’s never too late to prune, but avoid heavy pruning late in the season. Generally, you can always trim small suckers near the base and yellow or diseased leaves, but you should avoid removing lots of suckers (especially thick ones) if your plant is fully grown and loaded with fruit. [13] X Research source Heavy pruning at the end of the season can stress your plant and interfere with your harvest."
