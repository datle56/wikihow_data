      "title": "Start a Ranked game!",
      "content": "Start a Ranked game! Unlike before, it will be a mystery who you'll be getting, as all of the player's profile pictures are censored. In Legend and above, you will only see yourself in the waiting line."

    {
      "title": "Announce what lane you will inhabit for the game.",
      "content": "Announce what lane you will inhabit for the game. When the game starts, there will be a map of five lanes, namely Gold, EXP, Mid, Jungle, or Roam. To communicate which one you want, press the lane and you will be assigned. You can also showcase stats from separate lanes, whether from the current season or all time. If two or more players choose the same lane, the lane will glow red. Communication is necessary if this happens, and adjustment will be needed."
    },
    {
      "title": "Ban certain heroes.",
      "content": "Ban certain heroes. If you are in the bottom 3 of the team (Epic) or the bottom 4 (Legend), you are expected to ban a hero. Think of someone who is currently in the Meta and can dominate in the game. Put in the thought of some examples, including Yin, Hanzo, Granger, Nana, and Estes. Alternatives can include Hayabusa, Fanny, Saber, Badang, or Harley. However, avoid troll bans, including heroes that are not used a lot in Ranked Mode. Remember that this is a blind ban - itâ€™s possible that the same hero could be selected to be banned. Avoid being AFK during the process. This is an important ban process and if you slip a ban, you could allow the enemy team to choose powerful heroes. You will not automatically ban a hero from the game. In Mythic/MCL matchups, everyone will ban a hero of their choice, regardless of slot placement."

    {
      "title": "Communicate with your team.",
      "content": "Communicate with your team. Suggest certain bans of heroes, suggest what strategy you'll do (1-3-1 or 1-2-2), or tell them your win rate to get swapped. It's also the time to point out what the enemy may do, including if the jungler could be a hard carry."
    },
    {
      "title": "Select your heroes.",
      "content": "Select your heroes. It's not always guaranteed that you'll get your hero, due to certain players swapping for meta heroes and choosing counters over their main hero. Just note that this isn't a battle to select a hero the fastest, this is a chance to adjust what the enemy selects. Think of counter picks of a certain hero. This is well known for Mage users since his squishiness can be a problem due to OP heroes (mostly Marksman heroes). Also think of the MMR that the player is providing. If the hero is saying that Gusion has 3100 MMR, but the other has an MMR of 2985, it's recommended to swap the more dependent one. However, check if your teammates want the hero as well. In some cases, the last player (or two players) to select their hero for your team will have a yellow circle icon on them. If you select the yellow circle, you can communicate and suggest what hero role, lane, or one of the three favorite heroes to select. Whether your suggestion does happen, you can select the Thumbs Up icon to show them respect."

    {
      "title": "Change your hero.",
      "content": "Change your hero. When the final preparations open up, there's a chance you can swap your hero. However, the ally needs to have the same hero and agree once the request pops up. Once the final preparations finish, you will play a ranked game as usual."
