      "content": "Finalize your book . Before publishing your work through Kindle Direct Publishing, ensure your fabulous book is in tip-top shape. Scan your final draft for typos, syntactical errors, and unnecessary or difficult-to-follow passages. Trim as much as you can to really tighten up your composition. [1] X Research source Thorough editing is key to publishing good literature. The easier it is to read your book, the better it will be received. Amazon has a strict set of content quality standards, so if your book has lots of mistakes, it could be rejected. Consider having someone else proofread your book before submitting it, like a trusted friend or even a professional editor. [2] X Expert Source Grant Faulkner, MA Professional Writer Expert Interview. 8 January 2019. Books on unique niche topics tend to fare better in the self-publishing market. For example, a book on jewelry making with silver clay is targeted to a hyper-specific, niche audience."

[4] X Research source Authors on KDP should expect a 40-60% royalty on print books and up to 70% for ebooks (in specific territories).

This will include your name, the title of the book, a short description, and the appropriate age range, among other things. This information will determine how users discover your book on Amazon, so give this process lots of careful thought. At this stage, you can pick up to 7 identifying keywords and categories to help market to your intended audience. KDP suggests using keywords that include your book’s setting (California), character types (single mom, teenage daughter), character roles (strong female lead), plot themes (coming of age, motherhood), and story tone (drama). [9] X Research source Choosing accurate, engaging keywords is critical to bringing traffic to your book, as they help your book listing appear in focused search results like “Coming of age love story,” etc. To maximize your keyword’s effectiveness, think like a reader and use your chosen keywords to do a book search on Amazon. If the results are similar to your book, then you’re good to go, but if they’re inaccurate, you might want to switch out one or more of your keywords for more accurate results. Take your time filling out each item—the more complete your listing is, the better chance your book will have of getting noticed. And remember, you can change these over time. So feel free to experiment with different strategies!"

Otherwise, the site’s built-in design feature, Cover Creator , will walk you through how to put one together yourself. Your cover needs to be able to capture the reader’s attention instantly and offer a visual summary of the book’s contents or major themes. [10] X Research source Amazon recommends that images uploaded as cover art have a height/width ratio of 1.6:1. This means that for every 1,000 pixels in width, the image should be 1,600 pixels in height. Consider hiring a professional graphic designer or cover artist to design an original cover for your book. Professional-looking cover art will make your book more attractive to potential buyers! A catchy, intriguing title will stick in the reader’s mind, making them want to learn more."

It may help to look at similar titles for reference when deciding on a price for your listing. [14] X Research source You’ll have a couple of royalty options: 70% and 35%. In most cases, a rate of 70% will net you more money per sale. However, there's no delivery charge for physical copies if you only claim the 35% rate, and it may be your only option if you live in a smaller market or set a price lower than $2.99 to encourage sales. [15] X Research source Amazon deducts a small percentage from each sale (around 5%) as a “distribution fee” (even for eBooks) for publishing your work online."
