      "content": "Determine your resting heart rate. Many fitness trackers and watches come with a heart rate monitor. If you have one of these, record your heart rate while at rest (sitting down, doing little-to-no physical activity). The best time to measure your resting heart rate is in the morning before you get out of bed. To determine your heart rate without a monitor, place two fingers against the artery on the side of your neck, just under your jaw. You should be able to feel your heartbeat on your fingers. Set a timer for 60 seconds and count the number of beats you feel. This is your resting heart rate in beats per minute (bpm)."

      "content": "Calculate your maximum heart rate. The most common way to calculate your maximum heart rate is to subtract your age from 220. If you’re 25 years old, your HR max = 220 -25 = 195 beats per minute (bpm). There is some research that suggests this formula oversimplifies the calculation. You can also estimate your max heart rate with the formula HR max = 205.8 – (0.685 x age). [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Define the simple VO 2 max formula. The simplest formula to calculate VO 2 max is VO 2 max = 15 x (HR max /HR rest ). This method is considered to compare well with other common formulas. [4] X Research source The units for VO 2 max are milliliters of oxygen per kilogram of body weight per minute (mL/kg/min)."

      "title": "Calculate your VO2 max.",
      "content": "Calculate your VO 2 max. Using the resting and max heart rate you already determined, you can plug those values into the formula and calculate your VO 2 max. Let’s say you’re resting heart rate is 80 bpm and your max heart rate is 195 bpm. Write the formula: VO 2 max = 15 x (HR max /HR rest ) Plug in the values: VO 2 max = 15 x (195/80). Solve: VO 2 max = 15 x 2.44 = 36.56 mL/kg/min."

You want to make sure your walking track is mostly flat. Walk as quickly as possible without breaking into a jog. You should be breathing heavily, but able to speak 2 or 3 words in a row. On a scale of 1 to 10 the effort should feel like a 7 or 8."

If you are male, use the number 1, if you are female, use the number 0 for the calculation. [5] X Research source For example: A 26 year-old male who weighs 160 lbs, walks a mile in 15 minutes and has a heart rate of 120 at the end. VO 2 = 132.853 – (0.0769 x weight in lb) - (0.3877 x age) + (6.315 x gender) - (3.2649 x walk time in minutes) - (0.156 x heart rate) VO 2 = 132.853 – (0.0769 x 160) - (0.3877 x 26) + (6.315 x 1) - (3.2649 x 15) - (0.156 x 120) VO 2 = 132.853 - 12.304 – 10.08 + 6.315 – 48.97 – 18.72 = 49 mL/kg/min."
