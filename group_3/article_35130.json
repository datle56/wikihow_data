      "content": "Read Western (American) comic pages page from left to right, top to bottom. Start with the panel on the top, leftmost area of the page. Read each dialogue bubble from left to right, starting with the leftmost panel and moving your eyes to any dialogue featured on the bottom or right of the panel."

      "title": "Move to the next panel as you reach the right side of the first panel.",
      "content": "Move to the next panel as you reach the right side of the first panel. Most comic pages have two or three panels on the top row of the page. Repeat the way you’ve read the first panel on all subsequent panels."

    {
      "title": "Read panels that are stacked on top of each other together.",
      "content": "Read panels that are stacked on top of each other together. The panels are arranged in this way because they are meant to show two connected actions or pieces of dialogue. These panels will usually arranged differently from the other panels on the page, and will always interact with one another. They may slant to show dynamic action, or share a speech bubble or two. Start with whichever panel is on top, then read the panel just under it."

      "title": "Read manga (Japanese comics) from right to left.",
      "content": "Read manga (Japanese comics) from right to left. Japanese books are read in reverse order from American books. They are still read top to bottom, but progress from the right to the left and from back to front. Read both the panels and the dialogue from right to left, and the entire book from the back to the front."

      "title": "Pay attention to dialogue bubble shapes.",
      "content": "Pay attention to dialogue bubble shapes. Differently shaped dialogue bubbles indicate different forms of dialogue. Speech bubbles are circular, with a tail pointing to whichever character is speaking. This means a character is talking aloud. Jagged bubbles and/or enlarged, bold text can indicate that a character is shouting. Thought bubbles look like puffy clouds, and have a trail of dots pointing toward the character’s head. This means the character is thinking to themselves. Narration panels are square or rectangular blocks. This means the “narrator” is talking, telling you what is going on in a scene and revealing information the characters do not know."

      "content": "Figure out what kinds of stories interest you. There are all kinds of comic stories besides the usual superhero narrative, so you can approach picking out a comic like you would any other book. If you like romantic stories, there are comics under that genre. If action is more your thing, there are tons of comics that fulfill that want. Pick a genre and start exploring what comics fit the bill. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Pick the work of a specific writer. There are just as many comic book writers out there as there are comic book stories. You’ve probably heard about several popular writers as you’ve researched different comics. If the story arcs or subject matter they’ve written interest you, check out the rest of their library.

      "content": "Research the stories you’re interested in. Once you’ve figured out what you’d like to read, you may want to investigate the timeline of their stories. Many comics have been in print for decades, meaning there’s more story than you can expect to get through right away. Read up on what’s happened up to modern issues of the comic you’re interested in, and use any events that catch your attention as a launching point of where to start reading. [5] X Research source You can start researching comics and their characters by checking out online databases and encyclopedias devoted to specific publishers, series, or characters. Some great places to begin researching include https://www.comics.org/ , http://dc.fandom.com/wiki/DC_Comics_Database , and http://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Marvel_Database . [6] X Research source You can also obtain comic reference books from a library or bookstore. Several authors have written about the histories of comic publishers, series, and characters.

      "title": "Learn the terminology for comics.",
      "content": "Learn the terminology for comics. There are many different terms for the way comics are printed. Knowing what they mean will make it easier to know what you’re looking for. “Graphic novels” and “trade paperbacks” are multiple issues of one comic gathered into one book. They separate the storyline into larger chunks for you to read all at once. An “omnibus” is like a graphic novel or trade graphic book, except it bundles an entire storyline into one large book. These are great finds, but are generally much more expensive. Save this kind of purchase for stories you really like! “Issues” are small chapters of a storyline. They are usually released once every month. This is the most common way comics are published."

Comic shops are constantly adding new books to their inventory, and will have plenty of books to peruse while you decide what to read. Physical comics have the advantage of always being readable, even when your Internet is down. They also make it easier to display and show off your collection as it grows. Make sure you have adequate shelving or other storage space (boxes and/or bins) before you start collecting physical comics. [9] X Research source"

They are ideal if you don’t have a lot of space to keep physical comics, or just want to keep your collection organized as easily as possible. [10] X Research source Consider buying digital copies of comics to read, then buying print editions of your favorite stories to give the creators extra support. [11] X Research source You don’t have to choose one or the other. Plenty of comic fans have both digital and print copies of their favorite comics. Several printed comics also give digital copies of the same issues to buyers at no extra charge. [12] X Research source"

      "content": "Decide how you’ll store your comics. Comics are collectible items. While you buy them to read them, you want to preserve them so you can keep reading them years down the road. Keep them on shelves like you would normal books, but tuck them into special sleeves to keep them from yellowing. They will be made from plastic, and can be opened and closed with tape. [13] X Research source Some comics come with special collector’s boxes, which are great for protection and will look amazing on your shelves! [14] X Research source You won’t have this problem with digital comics, naturally—though you may want to back them up on separate cloud storage (like Dropbox or Google Drive), just in case something happens to your device or current cloud service."
