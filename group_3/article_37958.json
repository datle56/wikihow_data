      "title": "Sagittarius and Pisces have an intense attraction to each other.",
      "content": "Sagittarius and Pisces have an intense attraction to each other. At least at first, these two seem meant to be together. Their mutual lust seems insatiable and they can quickly become obsessed with each other. But over the long term, things can get shaky. Because they're both mutable signs, Sagittarius and Pisces both have a hard time planning for the future—they'd rather live in the moment and go with the flow. Sagittarius doesn't like to feel trapped or fenced in, which makes it difficult to keep him in a committed relationship for very long. But when Sag is seriously in love, he'll feel inspired to rise to the occasion and truly commit to his partner. And the lovely, sweet Pisces definitely has what it takes to capture his heart!"

They're also both highly imaginative, so get ready for plenty of passionate experimentation. Roleplay? Yes, please! They'll do everything to fulfill each other's greatest fantasies. Sagittarius: Give your favorite fish a little more cuddling and romance to really get her in the mood. She loves a gentle touch, especially at first.

      "title": "The archer isn't one for traditional romantic gestures.",
      "content": "The archer isn't one for traditional romantic gestures. A Sag guy tends to be more into lust than love, so he's going to go for something bold and sexy over something romantic. Think mirrors on the ceiling and black satin sheets instead of candlelit dinners or bubble baths with champagne. [1] X Research source Sagittarius: Don't shy away from wooing your Pisces lady with sweet gestures and private moments alone. She enjoys spending quiet time with you more than nights out on the town. Pisces: Give your favorite archer a little leeway in the romance department. He might not be the most romantic guy in the world, but he'll show you love in the way he keeps coming back to you."

      "title": "A Sagittarius guy might not be emotionally available enough for a Pisces lady.",
      "content": "A Sagittarius guy might not be emotionally available enough for a Pisces lady. Like most water signs, emotions run deep with a Pisces woman. But Sagittarius is a fire sign, and he's more of a doer than a feeler. He certainly acts like he loves her, but the sensitive Pisces lady might feel as though he's holding back emotionally. [2] X Research source Sagittarius: Consciously think about your emotions and be open to expressing them with your Pisces woman. Tell her it's hard for you and she'll find your efforts endearing. Pisces: Have patience with the archer. He's not used to being \"in his feels\" and might find it uncomfortable to open up to you. But pay attention to what he does for you—that's where he shines. Reader Poll: We asked 419 wikiHow readers what type of compatibilities are most important in a relationship, and 45% of them said emotional and trust. [Take Poll]"

      "title": "Both Sagittarius and Pisces are idealistic dreamers.",
      "content": "Both Sagittarius and Pisces are idealistic dreamers. Neither Sagittarius nor Pisces is extremely practical—which can cause some issues long-term. But at least initially, this works out great for them because they both look for the best in each other and are more interested in things as they could be rather than as they are. Sagittarius: Help bring your Pisces lady back down to Earth by grounding her more fantastical ideas in reality and helping her find ways to bring her dreams to fruition. Pisces: Encourage your Sagittarius guy to let go and dream with you. Create imaginary worlds for him to get lost in and he'll never want to leave your side."

      "title": "Sagittarius guys love to talk and Pisces ladies are great listeners.",
      "content": "Sagittarius guys love to talk and Pisces ladies are great listeners. There's nothing an archer enjoys more than sharing stories about his latest adventure or greatest ideas. When the Pisces lady listens raptly and asks questions to draw out more details, the Sagittarius guy can feel himself falling just a little more in love. [3] X Research source Sagittarius: Don't forget to ask your Pisces woman to share her thoughts and ideas as well! Her creativity and vivid imagination could send sparks shooting through your heart.

      "title": "A Pisces woman gives a Sagittarius guy the freedom he craves.",
      "content": "A Pisces woman gives a Sagittarius guy the freedom he craves. Sagittarius guys tend to be pretty independent, so any time they feel trapped, they're running for the hills. A clingy woman wouldn't work for the archer—luckily, Pisces doesn't have a clingy bone in her body. She's perfectly content to lose herself in her own thoughts and daydreams and doesn't feel like she needs a constant partner to complete her. Sagittarius: Check in on your Pisces woman every once in a while, even if you're out on an adventure, and let her know that you're thinking about her. It'll be just like you're there with her. Pisces: Encourage your Sagittarius guy to go out and explore and let him know that you trust him. He'll appreciate the freedom you give him and won't feel suffocated by your love. Reader Poll: We asked 706 wikiHow readers who are Pisces signs about relationship deal breakers, and 62% of them agreed that their biggest deal breaker is someone who lies . [Take Poll]"

      "content": "Both Pisces and Sagittarius are ruled by Jupiter, the planet of abundance.

      "content": "Blunt, straightforward Sagittarius can hurt the sensitive Pisces. The Pisces woman has an incredibly emotional and empathetic heart that's easily wounded by harsh words. [4] X Research source The archer's insistence on honesty can be tough for her to take. Sagittarius: It's less about what you say than about how you say it. Learn to speak to your Pisces lady with tact to avoid upsetting her. Pisces: If your archer says something that bothers you, speak up! Let him know what he said, and how he might say it differently in the future. Remember, it's just in his nature to speak bluntly, but he doesn't mean any harm."

      "title": "Their mutable natures can lead both Sagittarius and Pisces to distraction.",
      "content": "Their mutable natures can lead both Sagittarius and Pisces to distraction. Both Sagittarius and Pisces have very \"go with the flow\" natures. Over time, this can lead to problems because neither of them cares much about making plans for the future. They'd both rather live in the moment, but a Pisces woman also wants to know she has a partner she can depend on to be by her side for the long term. [5] X Research source Sagittarius: Be open with your Pisces lady about what you need in a relationship. She'll be willing to compromise if she understands your level of commitment. Pisces: Don't assume you have a committed relationship with your Sagittarius guy without talking to him first. He needs his freedom and doesn't like to feel trapped. Just talk about it and make sure you're both on the same page!"
