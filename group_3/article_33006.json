      "content": "Play the game on an oval field. The football pitch is split into three parts: Forward, Midfield, and Defence. [1] X Research source Each team will have 6 of their players in each part of the field, making 18 people on the field at all times, not counting any umpires. Cricket fields can usually double as pitches for Australian football, as they are usually similar sizes at around 180 meters (591 ft) in long and 150 meters wide. [2] X Research source Set up four tall posts (3 to 6 meters tall) that are around 6.4 meters (21 ft) apart at either end of the pitch that will serve as your scoring zones. The two center posts should be taller than the ones on either end"

      "content": "Start the game with a ball-up. Also called a ruck, the game starts with an umpire tossing the ball up in the center of the field, otherwise known as the centre square. A player dedicated from either team will then jump higher in order to pass the ball to their own teammates (similar to a jump ball in basketball.) [3] X Research source The ball is passed between players by tossing it. Overhand passing isn't allowed. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Kick the ball into the goal posts to score. Goals are worth 6 points and they’re scored when a player kicks the ball between the opposing team's two middle posts. The end posts are for behinds, which are worth one point. A behind means that the football passed the two behind posts in any other way. This can be if it hits a goal post, is deflected by another player through the posts, or goes between a long and a short goal post. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Pick strong, fast players your Forwards. The Forward positions are Full-Forward, Forward Pocket, Half-Forward, and Centre Half-Forward. For these positions, you’ll want to choose bigger, stronger, and more agile players. These players will be positioned closer to the goals in order to score and will often be a main target for the opposing team, getting tackled often. [6] X Research source Centre Half-Forwards are the ones who are counted on to kick the most goals. They should have good accuracy when kicking the ball. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Choose good runners for the Midfielders. Midfielders are always in the middle part of the pitch. They'll need to be slightly more versatile and help out both Forwards and Defenders. The positions in Midfield include: the Wing (runs the ball up the field), the Ruck (stays close to the ball), the Ruck-Rover (participates in the ball-up), the Rover (applies pressure to the other team), and the Centre (works with all other players). [8] X Research source Pick tall people to be the Rucks."

The positions include Full-Backs (defends their zone), Back Pockets (keeps opposing team from getting the ball), Half-Backs (mostly defensive, but takes the ball if they can), and Centre Half-Back (must out muscle the opposing Centre Half-Forward).

They have a job similar to referees, where their objective is to keep the game moving smoothly. Any statement made by an umpire is final. There 3 main umpires oversee timekeeping and infringements on rules, two who make note of the ball going out of bounds, and the last two who will see whether a goal has been scored or not.

After the mark happens the match will come to a short pause as the player is about to kick the ball from where they marked. [11] X Research source tutorialspoint.com/australian_football/how_to_play_australian_football.htm A player can't be tackled when they are preparing to kick the ball after a mark.

      "content": "Shepherd players on the opposing teams. Forwards can shepherd other players to get them away from the ball. This can be done by pushing them in the chest or side, or by placing your body between the opposition and the ball. [13] X Research source It’s a good technique to confuse the other player before they have time to get the ball, allowing one of your one teammates to retrieve it instead. Shepherding can only be done when the ball is less than five meters away."

      "title": "Overload the Defenders zone.",
      "content": "Overload the Defenders zone. Players on offense, or Forwards, will want to overwhelm the opposing Defenders by taking over the opposing team's \"danger zone\" (the zone closest to the goal posts.) [14] X Research source This way the Defenders will lose track of the opposing players in their zone and it’ll be easier for the Forwards to score a goal."

      "content": "Do person to person defense. With person to person defense, you're to focus on a specific player, similar to basketball. If this player has the ball, you've got to try to stop them from getting it closer to your goal posts or from passing the ball to another player on the opposing team."

      "title": "Perform zone defense.",
      "content": "Perform zone defense. In zone defense, players will have to defend an area rather than focusing on a specific person. [15] X Research source This is similar to soccer, where there isn't really any person to person defense. Australian football is unique in that it uses both types of defense."
