Check if your contacts are in the right position by closing one eye at a time and testing your vision. If your vision is blurry, then your contact may have slipped off the front of your eye.

Look up and carefully touch the bottom of your contact lens with the tip of your index finger on your dominant hand. Slide the lens down toward the bottom of your eye so you can get a better grip. Then, squeeze the bottom of the lens between your finger and thumb so it curves off of your eye and comes out easily.

If you have trouble gripping the lens, wet your fingers with a saline solution or contact cleaner to rewet your contacts."

Touch your contact with the pad of your dominant index finger and slide the contact towards the outer corner of your eye. Since the contact is soft, it will bunch up near the corner of your eye and fall out easily.
