      "content": "Understand the basics of overclocking. Overclocking is the process of increasing the clock speeds and voltage of your CPU to improve performance. It is a great way to get the most power out of a powerful machine or unlock a little more power out of a budget or old computer. Overclocking can damage your components, especially if the hardware is not designed for it or you push the voltages too high. You should only overclock if you are OK with the possibility of destroying your hardware. No two systems will overclock the same, even if they have the exact same hardware. This is because overclocking is greatly affected by small variances in the manufacturing process. Don't base your expectations solely on the results you read online for the hardware you have. If you are primarily looking to increase video game performance, you may want to consider overclocking your graphics card instead, as you will likely see better results. Laptops are not good candidates for overclocking, as their cooling capabilities are limited. You will get much larger performance increases on a desktop computer where you can control temperatures better and will likely end up overheating your laptop or frying your CPU if you try it."

      "content": "Download the necessary tools. You will need a few benchmarking and stress test tools in order to properly test your overclocking results. These programs test the performance of your processor as well as its ability to maintain that performance over time. CPU-Z - This is a simple monitor program that will allow you to quickly see your clock speed and voltage in Windows. It doesn't perform any actions, but its an easy-to-use monitor to help ensure everything is working correctly. Prime95 - This is a free benchmarking program that is widely used for stress testing. This is designed to be run for long periods. LinX - Another stress testing program. This one is lighter than Prime95, and is good for testing in between each change."

      "title": "Check your motherboard and processor.",
      "content": "Check your motherboard and processor. Different motherboards and processors will have different capabilities when it comes to overclocking. There are also slight differences when it comes to overclocking AMD versus Intel, but the general process is the same. The biggest thing you will be looking for is whether or not your multiplier is unlocked. If the multiplier is locked, you will only be able to adjust the clock speed, which usually yields less results. Many motherboards are designed for overclocking, and thus should give you full access to the overclocking controls. Check your computer's documentation to determine your motherboard's capabilities. Some processors are more inclined to successful overclocking than others. For example, the \"K\" line of Intel i7s are designed specifically to be overclocked (e.g. Intel i7-2700K). You can find your processor model by pressing ⊞ Win + Pause and looking in the System section."

      "title": "Run a baseline stress test.",
      "content": "Run a baseline stress test. Before you begin overclocking, you'll want to run a stress test using your base settings. This will give you a baseline to compare against as you start overclocking, and will also show if there are any problems with the base in the settings that need to be addressed before overclocking makes them worse. Be sure to check your temperature levels during the stress test. If your temperatures are above 70 °C (158 °F), you will likely not be able to get much out of overclocking before your temperatures become unsafe. You may need to apply new thermal paste or install a new heatsink. If your system is crashing during the baseline stress test, then there is likely an issue with the hardware that needs to be sorted out before you begin overclocking. Check your memory to see if there are any errors."

      "title": "Increase your base clock by 10%.",
      "content": "Increase your base clock by 10%. The base clock, also referred to as front side bus or bus speed, is the base speed of your processor. It is typically a lower speed that is multiplied to reach the total core speed. Most processors can handle a quick 10% jump at the start of the process. For example, if the base clock is 100 MHz, and the multiplier is 16, the clock speed is 1.6 GHz. Bumping it up 10% would change the base clock to 110 MHz, and the clock speed to 1.76 GHz."

If there are no problems, you're ready to move on. If your system is unstable, you may not be able to get much performance out of the overclock, and you should reset your settings to default."

      "title": "Increase base clock until the system becomes unstable.",
      "content": "Increase base clock until the system becomes unstable. Instead of increasing 10% each time, you'll want to reduce your increments to about 5-10 MHz per pass. This will allow you to find a sweet spot much easier. Run a benchmark every time you make an adjustment until you reach an unstable state. The instability is most likely caused by the processor not receiving enough power from the power supply. If your motherboard does not allow you to adjust the multiplier, then you can skip down to Part 4. If you can adjust your multiplier, then move on to the next section to try to get more gains. Make sure to record the settings you are currently at, in case you want to return to them later."

This will help make your multiplier increases more precise. Using a lower base clock and a higher multiplier will lead to a more stable system, but a higher base clock with a lower multiplier will lead to more performance. Finding the perfect balance is the goal."

You may hit a temperature limit before your system becomes unstable. If this is the case, you may have reached the limits of your overclocking ability. At this point, you should find the best balance between increasing the base clock and increasing the multiplier. While every CPU has a different safe temperature range, the general rule of thumb is to not allow your CPU to reach the 85 °C (185 °F) level. To check your CPU temperature, try opening the Task Manager ( Ctrl + ⇧ Shift + Esc ). If the information is not visible there, download a free third party monitor software. If you're working on a laptop computer, you probably can tell if it's overheating by placing your hand underneath it."

Raising your voltage beyond safe limits can quickly damage your equipment, so this is the most finicky and potentially dangerous part of the overclocking process. Every CPU and motherboard can handle different voltage increases, so pay extra close attention to your temperature. When raising your core voltage, increase it in 0.025 increments. Anymore and you run the risk of jumping too high and damaging your components."

Since you left your system in an unstable state in the previous section, you are hoping for a stable stress test run. If your system is stable, make sure that temperatures are still at an acceptable level. If the system is still unstable, try lowering either the multiplier or the base clock speed."

    {
      "title": "Return to either the base clock or the multiplier section.",
      "content": "Return to either the base clock or the multiplier section. Once you have managed to make your unstable system stable through increasing the voltage, you can go back to increasing either the base clock or the multiplier, depending on which you are trying to overclock. Increase them in the same small increments, running stress tests until your system becomes unstable again. Since the voltage settings increase temperature the most, your goal should be to maximize the base clock and multiplier settings to get the most performance out of the lowest voltage possible. This will require a lot of trial and error and experimentation as you try different combinations."

Eventually you will hit a point where you can't get any more increases, or your temperature is nearing unsafe levels. This is the limit of your motherboard and processor, and it is likely that you will not be able to progress past this point. [4] X Research source In general, you shouldn't raise your voltage more than 0.4 above its original level, 0.2 if you're using a basic cooling system. If you reach your temperature limit before you hit a voltage limit, you may be able to make more increases by improving the cooling system in your computer. You can install a more powerful heatsink/fan combo or opt for a more expensive but much more effective liquid cooling solution ."

This will lead to better and more reliable performance. If your system becomes unstable during this test, or your temperatures reach unacceptable levels, you'll need to go back and readjust your clock speed, multiplier, and voltage. When you open Prime95, select \"Just Stress Testing\". Click Options → Torture Test and set it to \"Small FFT\". Borderline temperatures are usually OK, since Prime95 pushes your computer more than most programs ever will. You may still want to back your overclock down a notch to be safe.
