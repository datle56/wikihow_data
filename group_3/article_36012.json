Self-massages have been used for centuries to help relieve constipation, and studies have shown that they soften stools, reduce the need for laxatives, and help you poop faster. Simply lie down on your back with your knees propped up with a pillow. Place both hands on your upper left abdomen below your ribcage. Move your hands in small circular motions down towards your leg, across your belly button, up the right side of your stomach, and then across.

Massage your stomach with a fist instead of a flat palm for added pressure to knead out stubborn gas bubbles and kinks. Talk to your doctor before trying a self-abdominal massage if you have spinal injuries, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), or inflammatory bowel disease. Do not attempt this relief method if you’re pregnant."

      "content": "Snack on some prunes. Prunes or dried plums are a sweet treat that’s high in fiber. These small, dried fruits pack quite a punch in flavor and can help your bowels get moving. They contain sorbitol, a sugar that naturally relieves constipation and stimulates bowel movements, making them the #1 food for passing stool. So, if you’re having trouble going to the bathroom, eat a few prunes and see if you have the urge to go after a few hours. [4] X Research source A single serving of prunes is 3-4 prunes, which contains about 3 grams of fiber. If the texture of a prune throws you off, no worries! Try drinking a small glass of prune juice instead. Stick to eating a serving of prunes at a time, as eating too many at once could cause diarrhea. Consider making your own prunes if you experience constipation often."
