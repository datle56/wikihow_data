      "title": "Let the glue thoroughly dry.",
      "content": "Let the glue thoroughly dry . This allows you to easily remove the glue in one clump instead of dealing with a messy glob of liquid. Hot glue dries fairly quickly. [3] X Research source You can test the glue by placing a toothpick on it; if the clump is solid and no glue transfers to the toothpick, the glue has fully dried."

      "title": "Soak a cotton swab into 70% isopropyl rubbing alcohol and dab around the glue.",
      "content": "Soak a cotton swab into 70% isopropyl rubbing alcohol and dab around the glue. Isopropyl rubbing alcohol will react with the glue and it will loosen its grip on the surface. Wait a minute or so to allow the loosening to occur. Most standard isopropyl rubbing alcohols contain approximately 70% pure isopropyl, while others contain as high as 91%. All isopropyl alcohols will work with this method.

      "content": "Peel the glue off with your fingers or a butter knife. If the glue is holding two objects together, first carefully remove one object before removing the glue from the other. You may need to dab more alcohol as you peel off the glue. Avoid using only your fingernails as the glue may be tough. Use your entire finger or butter knife for more control."

      "title": "Place the affected area under running cold water for 10 minutes.",
      "content": "Place the affected area under running cold water for 10 minutes. This will help the glue quickly cool down and prevent further burning . You may alternatively run an ice cube over the glue if the burning is not too painful. If the affected area cannot be run under a faucet, place the area in a bowl of cold water for 10-15 minutes. Massage the area with your fingers while it is under the water to remove the outer layer of the glue."

You may also use rubbing alcohol, but it may be painful if the skin underneath the glue is burned. [6] X Research source You should repeat this process until all of the glue is loosened. Use more olive oil or alcohol as needed. If the glue is not loosening, wash off the olive oil or alcohol and seek medical attention."

You may additionally want to take over-the-counter pain medication as needed. [8] X Research source If the pain continues for more than 2 days, seek medical attention for the burn. You may develop a blister on the area. Do not pop it or irritate the area until it heals naturally. Replace the bandage or gauze and reapply antibiotic ointment as needed."
