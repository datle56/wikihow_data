      "content": "Serial monogamy is the habit of quickly moving from one relationship to another. A serial monogamist is a person who spends as little time being single as possible, quickly beginning a new relationship after their previous one ended. Serial monogamists may have many short-lived relationships, or they may have several long-term ones. They only date one person at a time but struggle to stay single when they break up. [1] X Research source Serial monogamists are generally faithful to their partners, hence the term “monogamist.” However, the term can sometimes describe people who cheat on their partners while relationship jumping, as well. Serial monogamists differ from traditional monogamists, as traditional monogamists often take time to grieve and heal from their previous relationship before beginning a new one. Serial monogamists tend to jump back into dating before they’ve had time to fully process their breakup."

There often isn’t a large gap of time between relationships, as they rarely take the time to properly grieve and heal from their previous relationship. [2] X Research source Serial monogamists are preoccupied with love and strongly dislike being single. If you struggle to be single, try to reframe your thoughts and focus on the positive. In Chan’s opinion, “Getting to reinvent yourself is one of the most exciting things about being single. After a breakup, you get an opportunity to start with a blank canvas. You get to paint the type of life, love, and partnership you want, now with new wisdom and lessons learned.”"

Serial monogamists are usually faithful to their partners, but they may start thinking about ending a relationship a while before they do it.

However, certain symptoms of some mental disorders like borderline personality disorder (BPD), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and narcissistic personality disorder (NPD) sometimes make people more prone to serial monogamy and relationship instability. [14] X Research source People with BPD may have symptoms like fear of abandonment, low self-esteem, impulsivity, black-and-white thinking, and patterns of unstable or intense relationships. People with OCD may have obsessive thoughts about their relationship, like whether they’re good enough and whether their partner will leave them. This can lead to instability and irrational decisions in relationships. People with NPD may require high levels of attention and support, which can cause strain on relationships."

While this isn’t true for everyone, being single often allows people to learn who they are outside of their relationships so they can continue to grow and develop as a person. Serial monogamists may struggle with their identity and self-worth because they don’t take the time to get to know themselves when they’re single. [15] X Research source According to Chan, “Being single is a valuable time to get ‘back to you.’ When [we’re] in a relationship, sometimes we merge with our partner to a point of unbalance. Suddenly our identity and sense of validation become enmeshed with our relationship—which is an identity crisis waiting to happen.”"

People often need time to process their feelings, grieve, and heal before starting a new relationship. [16] X Research source When someone jumps into a new relationship without giving themselves time to grieve, they’ll likely carry emotional baggage and issues from their previous relationship into their next one. Chan stresses that it’s important to “Know the difference between processing and wallowing. The former means you feel the emotions and use self-care, self-compassion, and support to get back to an equilibrium… Wallowing is when you choose to see the situation in the lens of a victim. When you are stuck in victimization, you are not processing. You’re prolonging your suffering.”"

While everyone is different, because serial monogamists have been in many long-term relationships, they often know how to handle small issues and general relationship etiquette. They tend to be hopeless romantics who are attentive, affectionate, and devoted to their relationships.

It isn’t always unhealthy to be a serial monogamist, and many people go through periods of serial monogamy at some point in their lives. Many serial monogamists get married and have fulfilling long-term relationships. However, the pattern of serial monogamy can also be a sign of deeper psychological or emotional issues, especially if you find being single to be very upsetting or difficult. [22] X Research source Some studies suggest that serial monogamy has become more common as women have gained more rights. Whereas women in past generations were financially dependent on their husbands and often unable to leave relationships, women now have more power over their finances and personal circumstances, and can leave relationships much more easily. [23] X Research source (It’s important to note, however, that anyone of any gender can be a serial monogamist.)"

You may find a pattern that suggests you’re actually self-sabotaging . [25] X Research source For example, if you tend to pick fights or end relationships over minor issues, you may actually be pushing people away out of fear of being hurt or abandoned."

Being single gives you time to heal from past relationships and understand who you are outside of your relationships. Use this time to focus on your goals, hobbies , and non-romantic relationships. You’ll likely find something that makes you feel valued and fulfilled outside of a romantic relationship.

[27] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source To take things slow , set boundaries with the person you’re dating early on. Aim to see each other a couple times a week rather than every day. Don’t rush to label the relationship, and focus on having fun. Make sure you’re ready to start dating again. “If you are dating to distract yourself from the pain of your breakup,” Chan says, “you are not ready. When you date with the intention of creating connection, of practicing your ability to be present and curious, then you are ready.”"
