      "title": "Place cannabis buds into a grinder and twist the grinding lid.",
      "content": "Place cannabis buds into a grinder and twist the grinding lid. If your weed is from a dispensary, just pop 2-3 buds into the compartment of your grinder that contains the “teeth.” Then, twist the pivoting lid of the grinder back and forth until the buds are ground down into a fairly coarse, uniform consistency—aim for the consistency of herbs in a seasoning shaker. You’ll know you’re done when twisting the lid suddenly becomes much easier. [1] X Research source If your cannabis has large leaves or stems, break off only the buds—the bits that look a bit like dryer lint. Smoking leaves and stems might result in a harsher flavor. Break up larger buds with your fingers first, until you can comfortably fit 2-3 chunks into the grinder. Alternatively, rub 2-3 buds against the coarse surface of a grinding card , as though you were using a cheese grater."

      "title": "Or, break down your buds with your hands or a pair of scissors.",
      "content": "Or, break down your buds with your hands or a pair of scissors. No grinder? No problem. To grind weed without a grinder , simply roll the buds between your fingers to break them down into a coarse consistency. Or, grab a pair of scissors and snip them up until they’re fine, but not powdered. [2] X Research source Work over a length of parchment paper or an open plastic bag to catch any particles and prevent a mess. Alternatively, get culinary and place those buds in a mortar and pestle . Roll the pestle across the buds to break them down into coarse pieces. Wear nitrile gloves if you prefer to keep the smell of cannabis off your fingers."

      "title": "Place a screen inside the bowl of the pipe or bong.",
      "content": "Place a screen inside the bowl of the pipe or bong. A screen is a small metal or beaded mesh that acts as a filter, keeping the finer ash or particulate away from your lungs. Place the screen in the bottom of the bowl, over the small hole at the bottom. [3] X Research source Screens also keep your pipe or bong cleaner, preventing residue from building up inside it. Most cannabis vets recommend a screen, but it’s not strictly necessary. Just be sure to clean your pipe or bong afterward. Use a new screen each time you smoke, or scrub your screen with warm water and a toothbrush to clean it between uses."

      "title": "Place 2-3 pinches of grounds into the bowl and tamp them down.",
      "content": "Place 2-3 pinches of grounds into the bowl and tamp them down. Use your fingers to pinch the grounds into the empty bowl (never pack on top of old grounds, which could foster mold or other substances), or use a small spoon to transfer them. Start with a couple of pinches; you can always ash the bowl and load more later. With your finger or lighter, gently press the grounds into the bowl, which makes for a more even smoke. [4] X Research source Don’t tamp too hard! Give it a gentle press, then inhale through the mouth piece (or replace the bowl in your bong and then inhale) to test it. Aim to be able to breathe fairly easily through the tamped bowl. Optionally, add a drop of THC concentrate to the top of the bowl to intensify your high."

    {
      "title": "Smoking a pipe",
      "content": "Smoking a pipe Hold the pipe to your lips, covering the little hole (or “carb”) on the side of the bowl with your thumb. Hold a lighter up to the packed bowl so that the ground buds start to glow. After the buds catch, remove the lighter and inhale gently for 2-3 seconds to build smoke in the chamber. Then, remove your thumb from the carb and inhale until there’s no more smoke in the pipe. [5] X Research source Alternatively, light a hemp wick first, then use the lit wick to light the bowl to avoid inhaling butane, which may cause adverse health effects. A longer pull on the pipe while your thumb is over the carb will result in a greater amount of smoke to inhale, which will get you high faster. Replace your thumb over the carb to keep the bowl lit, even without a lighter. If the bowl extinguishes, just use the lighter again."

    {
      "title": "Smoking a bong",
      "content": "Smoking a bong Fill the main chamber with water until the stem of the bowl is submerged when inserted into its holster. Then, while the bowl is in the holster, light it with a lighter and place your mouth inside the large opening of the bong. Inhale for 4-5 seconds, watching for bubbles in the water that indicate you’re doing it right. Then, remove the bowl from the holster and inhale for 1-2 seconds to bring the smoke that’s gathered in the bong into your lungs. Unlike a pipe, it takes a bit more effort to clear the smoke from a bong. Only inhale as much as you feel comfortable with, then cover the mouthpiece with your hand to keep the smoke inside for the next hit. Using a hookah pipe is a bit different, but in many ways similar to a bong. For one, a hookah pipe uses burning coals, rather than a quick flick of a lighter."

      "title": "Dump out the used ashes in between smoke sessions.",
      "content": "Dump out the used ashes in between smoke sessions. To prevent microbial buildup in your bowl, tap it upside-down against the rim of a trash can to empty it. If any ashes stick to the sides, use a toothpick or a pen cap to scrape them away. Be sure the ashes are extinguished before you empty the bowl. [6] X Research source Ash your bowl immediately after a session. Not only can unashed bowls foster bacteria, they become harder to ash later as the contents solidify. Alternatively, dump the ashes into your garden, planting boxes, or compost to add them to your soil. Just don’t ash them onto the bare ground or a public walkway."

      "title": "Cover your pipe in isopropyl alcohol for 12 hours.",
      "content": "Cover your pipe in isopropyl alcohol for 12 hours. To clean a glass pipe , place it in a tupperware, plastic bag, or any container large enough to fully submerge it. Then, pour isopropyl alcohol into the container until it completely covers the pipe. Let it sit overnight or for at least 12 hours to let the alcohol disinfect the pipe and loosen any gunk. [7] X Research source Alternatively, place the pipe in a bath of white vinegar, then add 1–2 tablespoons (15–30 mL) of baking soda and let it sit for 12 hours. If you can, shift the pipe this way and that to dislodge any bubbles and get the alcohol totally inside it."

    {
      "title": "Rinse and scrub the pipe with a clean sponge or toothbrush.",
      "content": "Rinse and scrub the pipe with a clean sponge or toothbrush. Remove the pipe from the alcohol bath and run it under a warm tap. Use a new sponge or a spare toothbrush to gently scrub any exposed surfaces. Then, thoroughly rinse the pipe and set it on a paper towel to dry for 1-2 hours before using it again. [8] X Research source If the first bath didn’t get all the gunk out, rinse the pipe and place it in a fresh bath for another 12 hours. Wash your pipe at least once a week during regular cannabis use to keep it clean and ready for the next session."

      "title": "Disassemble your grinder and scrub it with a cotton swab.",
      "content": "Disassemble your grinder and scrub it with a cotton swab. To clean your grinder, first twist off all its parts. Most grinders have a base and a lid. Others have a detachable blade or an extra compartment to collect powder. Break it down into all its parts, then use a cotton swab to dislodge any large bud particles in the tight spaces. [9] X Research source If your grinder has a screen to filter powder, rub a dry toothbrush across the mesh to dislodge any stubborn residue."

      "title": "Soak the grinder in isopropyl alcohol, then rinse it with water.",
      "content": "Soak the grinder in isopropyl alcohol, then rinse it with water. Place the grinder in a tupperware or plastic bag, then fill the container with isopropyl alcohol, covering the grinder parts completely. Let the grinder soak for 12 hours, then remove it from the alcohol and rinse it under warm water. Then, dry it with paper towels and cotton swabs to prevent rust. [10] X Research source For plastic or acrylic grinders, submerge them in warm water with several pumps of dish soap instead, since alcohol might damage the material."

      "title": "Fill the chamber of your bong with salt and isopropyl alcohol.",
      "content": "Fill the chamber of your bong with salt and isopropyl alcohol. To wash a bong , first place it in the sink to more easily handle it during the process. Then, pour about 1 cup (300 g) of salt into the chamber, and fill it the rest of the way with isopropyl alcohol , leaving 3–4 inches (7.6–10.2 cm) of space at the top. [11] X Research source"

      "content": "Swirl the contents of the bong until the inside is clear of residue. Lift the bong and shake it gently to combine the salt and alcohol. As you do, the ingredients will soak and scrape the inside, removing any gunk or grime. Swirl the bong until you’ve removed as much residue as you can. [12] X Research source Pour out and refill the salt and alcohol 1-2 more times for a thorough clean."

      "title": "Rinse the bong under hot water and scrub it with a bottle brush.",
      "content": "Rinse the bong under hot water and scrub it with a bottle brush. Pour out the contents of the bong and run it under a hot tap. As you do, use a bottle brush to reach far inside and scrub away any residue the alcohol and salt may have left behind. [13] X Research source Then, give it another thorough rinse and set it on its side on a paper towel to dry for 2-3 hours. Use cotton swabs to reach into the stem of the bong and dislodge any stubborn residue. Clean your bong at least once a week to keep it sparkling and ready for the next bowl."

      "title": "Choose sativa for a more energized and creative high.",
      "content": "Choose sativa for a more energized and creative high. Hoping to dive into that art project, but want a little pick-me-up first? Go for a sativa strain. Plants in the sativa family are said to give you energy, focus, and a hefty dose of creative ideation. [14] X Research source Smoking sativa is said to be more stimulating than sedative. Sativa is also said to offer more heightened sensations of euphoria and boost your mood. Use sativa in the daytime for a more productive high than indica might offer."

      "title": "Opt for indica for a more relaxed high.",
      "content": "Opt for indica for a more relaxed high. Looking to just unwind and mellow out? Indica’s what you want. This strain is said to have sedative side effects, reducing anxiety and offering a more laid-back experience. [15] X Research source Just be sure to clear your schedule for the next few hours. Indica is also thought to increase your appetite more acutely than sativa, as well as encourage sleep. Use sativa in the evening or at night for a chilled-out end to your day."

      "title": "Go for a hybrid strain for a more balanced high.",
      "content": "Go for a hybrid strain for a more balanced high. Hybrid strains are bred from a combination of sativa and indica. As a result, they’re said to provide a best-of-both-worlds situation—a calmer high that still allows for some energy and creative output. [16] X Research source Note that some studies have reported little quantifiable distinction between participants’ behavior while smoking different strains. A hybrid blend might be your best bet if you can’t personally tell the difference."
