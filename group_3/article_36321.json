      "content": "Sweep the concrete area with a broom. Remove any leaves and debris from the surface. Leaves that have settled on the surface for longer are more likely to stain the concrete. [2] X Research source Although the leaf stains may be concentrated in a small area, it's best to clean the entire slab. Otherwise it can look patchy if you only clean the stained areas.

      "content": "Put on protective clothing. Depending on what agent you use to clean the stains, you may need to wear gloves or safety glasses. [4] X Research source Wear closed footwear to prevent exposed skin coming into contact with the chemicals."

      "title": "Make the cleaning agent in a bucket.",
      "content": "Make the cleaning agent in a bucket. Most products will require you to dilute them with a few gallons or litres of water. You can use a regular laundry detergent with bleaching properties (e.g. Oxiclean) or a special organic stain remover. Granular detergents are also great as they provide added friction when scrubbing. [5] X Research source Darker, tougher stains may not be removed with detergent. You can also prepare the cleaning agent in a watering can. This can help with applying it during the cleaning process."

      "content": "Spot test the cleaning solution first with a sponge. Choose a stained area that is hidden from view. If you have coloured concrete, some chemicals may cause the colour to change or fade. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Wet the stained concrete with plain water.",
      "content": "Wet the stained concrete with plain water. Use a garden hose or a pressure washer. This will help remove any remaining debris from the surface. Damp concrete will allow the cleaning agent to permeate better. [9] X Research source For deep-cleaning concrete, a pressure washer that can reach 3,000 psi (pounds per square inch) is recommended. [10] X Research source If using a pressure washer, begin with a low pressure setting first so there’s no recoil when the machine is started. [11] X Research source"

      "content": "Apply the cleaning solution. A watering can allows you to pour it. [12] X Research source Leave the detergent or organic stain remover to seep into the stained concrete for a few minutes. [13] X Research source It will be more effective if you give it time to soak in. Some detergents can be dispersed using a pressure washer. This is dependent on both the detergent and the pressure washer that you use. [14] X Research source Keep the areas wet, don't let the detergent or stain remover dry on the surface.

      "content": "Scrub the stain with a stiff brush. Apply some force while scrubbing. Use circular motions rather than side-to-side/up and down. [16] X Research source Don’t use a wire brush as this may scratch your concrete surface. [17] X Research source"

      "content": "Rinse the concrete surface. Once it is clean, wash all the detergent or organic stain remover from the concrete. Dispose of the contaminated water safely. Leave the concrete to dry. You may have to repeat the process if the stains have not been removed completely. Organic stains are carbon-based, making them the toughest to remove. [18] X Research source"

      "title": "Use a sealant to seal the surface.",
      "content": "Use a sealant to seal the surface. A thin coat of sealant is usually applied with a roller or sprayer. It can prevent the concrete from staining and provide resistance against UV sunlight and abrasions from foot traffic. [21] X Research source The concrete must be clean and completely dry before you apply a sealant. Always follow the manufacturer’s guidelines for the product you are using. [22] X Research source Look for sealants that are “breathable”. This allows water to escape without getting trapped in the concrete. [23] X Research source"
