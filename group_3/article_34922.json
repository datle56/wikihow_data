      "content": "Pose questions that need more than 1 or 2 words to answer. Open-ended questions about her thoughts, feelings, and opinions are a great way to get her to give more meaningful answers and reveal more about who she is and what she values. Asking better questions helps you show you’re interested in her and what she has to say, which may help her to feel more comfortable opening up to you. They can also reduce awkward silences and make people like you more, which helps keep the conversation going . [2] X Research source Once she answers your questions, ask her follow-up questions to learn more about her and keep her talking. For example: “How did you feel about that?” “What did you do next?” “What do you mean by that?” “Why do you think that?”"

      "title": "Listen attentively to the other person’s answers.",
      "content": "Listen attentively to the other person’s answers. Jean says that one of the best ways to keep a conversation going with a girl is to pay attention to what she’s saying. Always practice active listening , which is really paying attention to what the other person is saying so you can understand what they’re feeling. It allows you to better relate to them. This type of listening helps to show respect and build trust, which are both important for building a connection with someone. [3] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Be present in the conversation to be an active listener. That means giving the other person your full attention. Don’t check your phone, and don’t try to think of what you want to say next while they're talking. Maintain natural eye contact with the other person to show they have your attention. You don’t have to stare intently; just stay focused on them. Use friendly, open body language. Subtly lean toward the other person and mirror their body language. An example of mirroring might be taking a sip of water or shifting your weight just after they do."

      "title": "Offer her genuine compliments that focus on what she does.",
      "content": "Offer her genuine compliments that focus on what she does. Miller cautions against always focusing on looks. “[A compliment] should be, ‘Hey…I really liked your passion when you are working,’ or something that you have noticed that can really speak to that person so they feel seen.” Tell her what you like about her personality or admire about her accomplishments. Actively listen to what she’s saying to learn what she values in herself and other people. This tells you what types of compliments are more meaningful to her. Always be sincere and honest when you’re paying a compliment. Authentic compliments just seem to land better than empty flattery. Try to avoid focusing on her appearance or paying overly sexual compliments that might make you seem creepy or rude. If you do compliment her appearance, stick with something like, “I really like that dress. The color looks nice on you.” This focuses on her sense of style rather than her face or body."

      "title": "Share your perspective and answer questions honestly.",
      "content": "Share your perspective and answer questions honestly. Miller says, “People like you for who you are. I think it's very rare for people to like somebody who's not authentic and not real. So that old cliché of 'be yourself'...it's a cliché for a reason.” Always give your genuine opinion or an authentic answer to any question she poses. You don’t have to be perfectly serious with every single answer. But if you answer with a joke, make sure it’s clear you’re just kidding. The goal of these early conversations is to try to find common ground with her to make a connection and see if you’d be a good match. Jean says, “People are typically more willing to open up to someone if they feel as if they share common passions, viewpoints, and other views.” Miller adds, “You don't want to present a false sense of yourself because you want people to like you for the real you.”"
