      "content": "Spray the mixture onto a clean cloth. Dampen a paper towel or a rag with your cleaning solution, but don't use so much that you saturate it. Then, wring out the cloth before you use it so you only apply a thin layer of the solution. [2] X Research source If it's possible, avoid using a cloth that's been dyed. Some of the color may transfer to your leather shoes, discoloring them."

After you’ve wiped up the excess cleaning solution, add the baking soda to the inside of each of the leather shoes and shake them well. Make sure the powder penetrates down to the toe and coats all of the insides of the leather shoes. [5] X Research source If the baking soda doesn’t cover the insides of the shoes, add another 1 teaspoon (4.9 mL) and shake them again. Baking soda absorbs unpleasant odors.

If the odor is still there, apply the spray once more, allowing them to dry a second time. You can repeat the process as many times as necessary, but be sure to allow the leather shoes to fully dry between applications. That way, the leather won't soak up the moisture, which could cause it to warp."
