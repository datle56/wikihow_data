While you don’t have to use your official work or business email, make sure that your login is something that can be easily traced back to you. In order to play the National Lottery online, you must have a digital account.

      "content": "Select which lottery game you’d like to play. Choose whichever option appeals the most to you. Aside from the regular Lotto, there are other game options to choose from like EuroMillions, Set For Life, Lotto HotPicks, Thunderball, and Instant Win Games. It might be easier if you decide how much you’re willing to spend and risk before playing a specific game. [2] X Research source For example, enter the Set For Life lottery if you want a chance to receive £10,000 per month over 3 decades. On the other hand, play EuroMillions if you want to enter a risky gambit for more money. Thunderball and Lotto HotPicks work similarly to the regular lotto, though the play slip is slightly different."

      "content": "Choose 6 numbers to enter the regular Lotto. Think of 6 different numbers between 1 and 59 to play for your Lotto submission, and enter them on the Lotto entry webpage. If you can’t decide on a set of numbers to enter, consider hitting the “Lucky Slip” button, which generates random number selections for you. [3] X Research source It costs £2.00 to play one round of Lotto numbers. You can buy up to 10 pay slips of entries, if you’d like. The Lotto picks its winning numbers on Wednesday and Saturday, so decide how often you want to play."

      "title": "Purchase multiple entries at a time if you don’t want to buy a new slip each week.",
      "content": "Purchase multiple entries at a time if you don’t want to buy a new slip each week. Opt to buy several weeks of Lotto plays at a time if you’re feeling especially lucky. It can be tedious to constantly be entering and submitting different plays for the biweekly draws, so the advanced purchase feature can really come in handy for those who wish to gamble in bulk. [4] X Research source Depending on your mood, you can purchase up to 4 weeks of plays in advance, or you can charge your card on a weekly basis."

      "content": "Wait for the winning numbers to be announced. Check online or on your local television to watch the live drawings. If you’ve entered the regular Lotto, the results will be announced on Wednesday and Saturday at 8:00 PM and 7:45 PM GMT. Compare your selected numbers with the announced winners to see if you’ve won any cash for the week. If some of your numbers match the numbers drawn on television, then you’ve won! [5] X Research source If at least 2 of your selected Lotto numbers match the drawing, you’ll win a free lucky dip (random play) for a future Lotto. Having 3 matching numbers gets you £30, while 4 give you £140. The prizes really get loaded once you start matching 4 or more numbers with the drawing, which equals £1,750 in winnings. You need to match all 6 numbers to win the jackpot. In the event that this doesn’t happen, you need to match at least 5 lottery numbers in addition to the bonus ball to win."

There are different types of cards you can choose from that offer different levels of prize money, so feel free to opt for a less risky prize. If you’re feeling especially bold, buy more than one card for a higher chance at winning! [7] X Research source Certain Scratchcards cost more money than others. For example, the £4 Million Black card costs £10 to play, while cards like the £100,000 Purple and £100,000 Yellow only cost £1 to play. Depending on the popularity of card, extra prizes might be added to compensate for the additional interest."

Follow the instructions on the card so you can reveal the prizes as efficiently as possible. [8] X Research source For example, the Super 7s card has 12 small squares for you to scratch off. If you uncover a 7 or an X2 on your card, you’ll win whatever prize is listed."
