      "title": "Avoid under-correcting your vision.",
      "content": "Avoid under-correcting your vision. Some people ask their doctors to write a prescription weaker than what they actually need, giving them worse than 20/20 vision. Some people believe that this makes the eyes work to adapt to blurrier vision and self-correct. However, the vast majority of scientific studies do not back this up. Make sure to fill your prescription exactly as your doctor writes it. Some studies found that under-correction of myopia made vision worse over time."

      "content": "Spend more time outside. Recent studies suggest that spending more time outside as a child, teen, or young adult may help slow the progression of nearsightedness over the course of your whole life. Researchers haven't recommended any particular amount of time, but suggest getting outside every day to improve your vision. [3] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source These studies have suggested that simply spending time outside makes the difference.

      "content": "Avoid reading in dimly lit rooms. One study suggested that increased indoor lighting could potentially reduce myopia. More research is needed in this area, but it won't hurt to do indoor work in well-lit areas. Research suggested for many years that children who spent too much time reading in the dark developed nearsightedness. Although more recent research has cast doubts on this correlation, reading or writing in the dark can still cause eye strain. [7] X Research source"
