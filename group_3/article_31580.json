      "content": "Check for a fuel release lever near the bottom of the driver’s seat. Many cars have a fuel release lever that you have to engage in order to unlock the gas tank door. If your car has one, it will be near the bottom of the driver’s seat, close to the driver’s side door. Look for a small lever with a gas pump on it, then pull the lever up to engage it. [2] X Research source You’ll hear a small “thunk” as you pull the lever—that means the gas tank door is unlocked."

      "title": "Look for a fuel release button on the driver’s side door.",
      "content": "Look for a fuel release button on the driver’s side door. Newer cars may have a fuel release button rather than a lever. Check the lower part of the driver’s side door for a button with an image of a gas pump on it. When you find it, press the button to unlock the gas tank door. [3] X Research source The button may also have a small lock and unlock symbol on it."

If you’re searching for an unlock button or lever and can’t find one, there’s a chance that your car doesn’t have one. Step out of the car and then press the gas tank door inwards. If it unlocks this way, it will spring open automatically after you push it in. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Turn the fuel cap counterclockwise to open it. Once your gas tank door is open, turn the fuel cap counterclockwise, then start pumping your gas . [5] X Research source Your car may have a locking gas cap on it. If it does, simply take the key and insert it into the gas cap, then twist it counterclockwise to unlock it. If you live in a state where you don’t have to pump your own gas, don’t worry about unscrewing the gas cap—the attendant will do that for you."

      "title": "Open the trunk and move the access panel near the fuel tank.",
      "content": "Open the trunk and move the access panel near the fuel tank. If your gas tank door is stuck shut, there’s most likely a problem with the release lever inside of the car. You can access this lever by opening your trunk and removing the plastic access panel that’s closest to the fuel tank. [7] X Research source If your car does not have an access panel, simply remove the cloth lining near the inside of the fuel tank. If you’re driving a vehicle without a trunk (like a truck), accessing the mechanism behind your gas tank may be difficult. Take your car to a licensed mechanic so they can access the mechanism for you."

      "content": "Press the manual release lever with your hand. Reach inside the access panel until you touch a small box with a lever on the side. Press the lever downward to unlock the fuel tank door manually (you’ll hear a small click as you do this). Your gas tank door will be open, and you can now pump your gas. [9] X Research source Your car may have a manual release pin instead of a lever. If you reach inside and see a pin, simply turn the pin counterclockwise, then pull it out. If your gas tank door does not have a fuel release button or lever (meaning you push it to unlock it), have a friend gently pry the gas tank door upward as you press the manual release lever."

      "title": "Replace the manual release lever.",
      "content": "Replace the manual release lever. A faulty release lever means that you can’t unlock your gas tank door whenever you need to. Fortunately, these parts are usually fairly cheap, and a mechanic can replace them easily. Take your car to a mechanic and have them replace the part to get your gas tank door working again. [10] X Research source Sometimes, the gas tank door locking mechanism will stop working because a fuse has blown. If that’s the case, you can change the fuse yourself or take your car to a mechanic."
