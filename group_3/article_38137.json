      "title": "“Mujer hermosa” (moo-HEHR ehr-MO-sah) means “beautiful woman” in Spanish.",
      "content": "“Mujer hermosa” (moo-HEHR ehr-MO-sah) means “beautiful woman” in Spanish. Hermosa is one of the most common Spanish words for “beautiful” and mujer means “woman” in Spanish. Since the adjective generally comes after the noun in the Spanish language, the final translation for “beautiful woman” is mujer hermosa (or mujeres hermosas when referring to multiple “beautiful women.” [1] X Research source You may sometimes see people switch the word order to say “hermosa mujer,” which is usually used to convey an emphatic or emotional effect. However, “mujer hermosa” is more grammatically correct and generally more common. [2] X Research source Alternatively, use the term “hermosura” as a noun to refer to “a beautiful woman” or talk about a woman as “a beauty.” The word hermosa in this phrase can be replaced with a Spanish synonym that also means pretty or beautiful, such as guapa , bella , or preciosa . When learning Spanish , pay close attention to pronunciation. For example, the Spanish “h” is typically silent (compared to the hard “h” in English), and the Spanish “j” is pronounced like an English “h.”"
