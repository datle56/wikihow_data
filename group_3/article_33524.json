The objective is the person, place or thing that the other players are trying to figure out. For example, the “person” can be living, dead or even a character from fiction. The “place” can be anywhere on the globe. The “thing” can be any inanimate object. The other players are the \"questioners.\" Once decided, the answerer should not tell anyone what the objective is.

These questions must have simple “yes” or “no” answers. The answerer will keep track of the number of questions asked. The limit for each round is 20 questions. Sample questions: \"Is it a mammal?\" or \"Is it bigger than a basketball?\" or “Can you walk on it?” Any question that helps the players determine the objective can be asked."

If no one has figured out the correct answer after 20 questions are asked, the answerer wins the round and gets to be “it” again for the next round. Each round takes approximately 5 minutes. If no one guesses the right answer after 20 questions are asked, the answerer should reveal the answer to the players before moving on to the next round."

It should be someone you don’t know since the trick depends on you not knowing their birthday. Have them add that number to the age they’ll be at the end of the year. They can write it down on a piece of paper if that helps them do the math more easily. Make sure that they don’t let you see it. Example 1: Born in 1981. So 81 + 35 (age) = 116. Example 2: Born in 1999. So 99 + 17 (age) = 116."

If you know or suspect that the person was born in or after the year 2000, the answer will always be “16” rather than “116.” Example: The birth year is 2003, so the last 2 digits of the year are 03. If the person adds the age they’ll be at the end of the year to that number, it will always be 16. In this case, a person born in 2003 is 13 years old. 03 + 13 = 16. Note that the invariable answer depends on the current year. In the year 2017, the answer will always be 117 (17 if born in or after 2000). In 2018 the answer will always be 118 (or 18), and so on."

Also, avoid picking the super shy person hiding out near the back. Select someone who falls somewhere in between those extremes. This person is engaged and paying attention, but not jumping up and down with excitement. The people who are overly eager to participate are usually just seeking attention for themselves. You don’t want to perform with someone who is trying to upstage you. The very shy people don’t want to be involved and are generally not very enjoyable to perform with."

Certain movements can give you helpful clues about a person’s current mental state. This is very helpful when you're performing. For example, if someone is fidgeting with their hands, shaking their leg or tapping their toes, this usually indicates anxiety, irritation or boredom. [1] X Research source Being able to read body language is a useful skill to have when you're playing other kinds of games, too. For example, card games. Good posture and standing up straight communicates confidence and alertness; slouching indicates shyness, sadness or a lack of confidence. Pay attention to your own body language as well. Stand up straight and look the person directly in the eye. Avoid fidgeting."

When the muscles around the mouth are pulled back, the eyebrows are lifted and/or the forehead is wrinkled, this usually means the person is afraid, nervous or lying about something. When you’re performing, remember these tips for yourself, as well. [3] X Research source Control your facial muscles as much as you can so that you won’t give anything away. This skill is also very useful for card games. Avoid making any extra facial movements, such as eye rolling, that can communicate negativity and judgement."
