      "content": "Do all hotels have bed bugs? Unfortunately, nearly all hotels and motels have probably dealt with bed bugs at one point or another. This even includes 5-star luxury hotels. Bed bug infestations don’t mean the hotel is dirty; they occur because of high occupancy turnover, as guests often carry the bugs in unknowingly. Most hotels treat infested rooms as soon as possible to prevent the infestation from spreading. Unlike many other bugs, bed bugs are not attracted to dirt or decomposing materials. Instead, they’re attracted to warmth, blood, and carbon dioxide, which is why they often infest areas with high occupancy.
