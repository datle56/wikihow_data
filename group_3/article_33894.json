Spend some time picking out an outfit that you like, or gather your school uniform and lay it out beside your bed so you can quickly get dressed and don’t have to scramble to find clothes. Choose clothes that make you feel confident and make sure they’re clean. Pack your school supplies into your backpack so you can grab it and go. [1] X Research source If you have to wear a school uniform, use accessories to add your own style to your look. Jewelry like necklaces or bracelets can really brighten up your uniform. Just make sure it’s not against the rules. Be sure to follow your school's dress code, even if you don't have uniforms. You don't want to get in trouble on your first day!"

Decide if you’re going to be taking the school bus, if a friend or their parent is going to pick you up, or if your parents are going to drop you off so you can make a plan. Don’t wait until the last minute to organize your ride! If you live close enough, you may be able to walk or ride a bicycle to school. Riding the bus allows you to talk to other students and make some friends. You could also join a carpool so you can ride to school with your friends."

Put away your phone and turn off your TV about half an hour to help your mind calm down, especially if you’re feeling nervous. Try listening to some quiet music or reading a book to relax. Go to bed early enough to give yourself a full night’s rest so you wake up refreshed and ready to take on the day.

      "content": "Talk to your parents or a friend if you’re feeling nervous. It’s totally normal to feel a little anxious or nervous about a new school year. Try talking to somebody you trust, like a close friend or a family member. Tell them about how you’re feeling. They may be able to reassure you, and you may feel better just by talking about your feelings. [3] X Research source You don’t have to bottle up your feelings. If you’re nervous, talk to somebody about it. If it’s a friend, chances are they’re nervous too! Your parents can remind you about other times you were worried but ended up doing a great job. For instance, maybe you were super anxious before school a few years ago. But you did great, right?"

      "content": "Arrive at school 15 minutes early to find your classes. Pritchard advises figuring out where each of your classes are ahead of time so that you're less nervous about being late. Meet up with friends and find out if you have any classes together. Find out where your first class is located so you know exactly where you need to go. Knowing where you need to go and where everything is may help you feel less anxious about the first day. If you ride the bus to school, you’ll usually arrive a few minutes before classes start, giving you plenty of time to catch up with friends and scope out your classes."

      "content": "Introduce yourself to your teachers to start off on the right foot. When you arrive at your classroom, go talk to your teacher. Tell them your name and what you’re excited about for their class. You’ll make a good impression and your teacher is much more likely to remember you if you need assistance in the future. For example, if you love books, tell your English teacher that you’re looking forward to reading for their class. Building a strong relationship with a teacher can be a game changer if you need that extra boost with your grade at the end of the year."

The first day of school usually doesn’t involve a lot of classwork or lectures, but if there are, take notes so you can review them later. If your teacher asks for a volunteer, don’t be afraid to go for it! But, if you’re nervous, it’s okay to lay low, take notes, and answer questions only when your teacher asks you.

      "content": "Look up clubs and sports teams you want to join. School clubs tend to start early in the year, so it's a good idea to look at what clubs and sports your school offers. Check out their website and ask around to see if there are any that you’re interested in joining so you can sign up when school starts. Pritchard suggests, \"Ask your school counselor [about] different clubs or sports, and...have your counselor get you in touch with a coach or another student who they know is involved in that. And then that's a good way to...meet somebody who has similar likes and interests.\" You could also check out the school’s bulletin board or call the main office to learn more about clubs and sports teams. Do you love music? Join the school choir or guitar club. Do you love soccer? Try out for the soccer team. Clubs are a great way to nurture interests you already have, and a perfect outlet to meet people operating on a similar wavelength. If you're really interested in something and there isn't already a club for it, start a school club yourself!"

Try to knock it out in chunks throughout the summer so you’re finished and prepared for any assignments by the time school starts. Set yourself a daily minimum of pages to read so the books are finished before school starts. [12] X Research source For example, you can count the number of pages in the books and divide the total number of pages by the days until school starts and use that number as your daily minimum that you need to read.
