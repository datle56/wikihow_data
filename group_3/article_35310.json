      "title": "Lay the jersey on an ironing board.",
      "content": "Lay the jersey on an ironing board. Spread your jersey flat on an ironing board with the plastic lettering facing upward. Smooth out the fabric as much as you can before you get started. [1] X Research source Smooth out the lettering as much as you can, too. If there are any corners peeling up, press them down flat onto the jersey material. The ironing method works well for plastic and vinyl lettering."

      "title": "Set your iron to medium heat with the steam turned off.",
      "content": "Set your iron to medium heat with the steam turned off. To reattach your letters, you only need heat, not steam. Let your iron sit for a couple of minutes to let it heat up. [2] X Research source Different irons have different heat settings, but most use numbers to indicate how hot they’ll get. If your iron uses numbers, set it to level 3."

    {
      "title": "Place a plain sheet of paper over the lettering.",
      "content": "Place a plain sheet of paper over the lettering. Paper will protect the lettering on your jersey from getting too hot. Grab a plain white sheet of paper and place it on top of the letters that you want to reattach. [3] X Research source Be sure to use plain white paper, not lined paper. Lined paper may leave ink residue on your jersey. If you don’t have paper, you can also use a thin cotton towel."

    {
      "title": "Iron the lettering to smooth down any edges.",
      "content": "Iron the lettering to smooth down any edges. Grab your iron and place it gently on top of the lettering on your jersey. Run the iron quickly back and forth, without staying in one place for more than a few seconds. Go over all your lettering, and pay special attention to any areas that are peeling up. [4] X Research source Keep the iron flat on top of the paper to avoid any creasing."
    },
    {
      "title": "Peel the paper up while the lettering is still hot.",
      "content": "Peel the paper up while the lettering is still hot. Once you’ve ironed over all your lettering, quickly grab the paper and remove it from your jersey (otherwise, it could stick to the lettering). Enjoy your jersey that looks brand new again! [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Spread the jersey out on a flat surface.",
      "content": "Spread the jersey out on a flat surface. If your jersey is dirty, wash it before you start. Spread the jersey out on a flat surface with the lettering facing upward, and smooth out any wrinkles or lumps."

    {
      "title": "Dab a small dot of fabric glue under the edge of the letter.",
      "content": "Dab a small dot of fabric glue under the edge of the letter. Gently grab the edge of the lettering and peel the corner upward. Grab your fabric glue and put a small dot directly onto the jersey where you want the lettering to lay flat."
    },
    {
      "title": "Press the letter down into place.",
      "content": "Press the letter down into place. Push the lettering down onto the glue that you put on your jersey. Hold it in place for a couple of seconds to adhere the lettering to the glue. If any glue squeezes out of the sides, wipe it up before it dries."

    {
      "title": "Iron the lettering with a thick towel over it.",
      "content": "Iron the lettering with a thick towel over it. Ironing your jersey will help the glue set and also keep the letters laying flat as they dry. Spread your jersey out on an ironing board, then put a thick towel over the lettering. Set your iron to the hottest setting and iron the letters for about 30 seconds."
    },
    {
      "title": "Let the fabric glue dry before wearing your jersey again.",
      "content": "Let the fabric glue dry before wearing your jersey again. For the best results, keep your jersey laying flat for about 24 hours before you put it on again. That way, your glue will adhere to your jersey fabric, and your lettering will stay in place for much longer. Need to wash your jersey? No problem! Fabric glue can be washed and dried without peeling off. Simply wash your jersey like you normally would once it’s dirty."
