It can be used to diagnose gynecological conditions (such as pelvic pain and unusual bleeding) or visualize the early phases of pregnancy. [2] X Research source During the procedure, your doctor inserts a transducer, which is about the size of a speculum, into your vagina. From there, the transducer emits sound waves that allow your doctor to visualize your internal organs. Intravaginal ultrasounds are painless but you might feel pressure and discomfort during the procedure."

Intravaginal ultrasounds are performed whenever your doctor needs to take a closer look at your reproductive organs, such as the cervix, ovaries, and uterus. Your doctor may also perform an intravaginal ultrasound to monitor your pregnancy and fetus. [3] X Trustworthy Source Johns Hopkins Medicine Official resource database of the world-leading Johns Hopkins Hospital Go to source Your doctor may order the procedure if you experience unexplained pain, bleeding or bloating. For example, intravaginal ultrasounds can reveal changes in the shape and density of your reproductive tissues and can also be used to visualize blood flow to your pelvic organs. It can be used to monitor fibroids, ovarian cysts, and cancerous growths in your pelvic organs or diagnose the cause of vaginal bleeding and cramping. Intravaginal ultrasound can also help diagnose infertility issues or abnormalities in the bladder, kidneys and pelvic cavity. During pregnancy, your doctor can use it to detect the early stages of pregnancy, monitor the development of your fetus, detect multiples, and rule out an ectopic (tubal) pregnancy."

      "title": "Schedule the procedure.",
      "content": "Schedule the procedure. The timing of this procedure depends on the reason why you need to have it done. During pregnancy, an intravaginal ultrasound can occur as early as 6 weeks after conception but typically is done between 8 and 12 weeks of pregnancy. If your doctor is trying to diagnose a reason for unusual pain or bleeding, your procedure will likely be scheduled immediately. If you need an intravaginal ultrasound for infertility issues, then your doctor may choose to perform it around the time you ovulate. An intravaginal ultrasound can be performed at any time during the menstrual cycle, but it is usually best to have it done right after your period ends, between days 5 and 12 of your cycle. During these days, your endometrial lining is the thinnest, which allows for clearer images of your uterus."
