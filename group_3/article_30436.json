If you are not confident in your abilities, use a mannequin head instead; make sure that it has lashes. You can also place the pad down onto a strip of paper or even a plastic mask."

If you are practicing on a piece of paper, draw a faux lash line first. The length of the lines does not matter, as long as it is longer than the client's lashes. [2] X Research source These are your frame. You will be creating the map within these 2 lines. Press lightly, especially if you are working on a client."

Again, the length of the line does not matter. One side of the line will be referred to as the \"inner eye,\" and the other side of the line will be the \"outer eye.\" [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Divide the map up further into smaller segments. Plan on having 3 segments towards the inner eye, and 4 segments towards the outer eye. Keep these lines straight and angled; they need to match the natural angle of the client's lashes. Play around with different widths. [4] X Research source Put the widest segment in the middle. Put the narrowest segments in the outer eye area. Keep the medium segments in the inner eye area."

Match the first and last segments to the person's natural lashes, then increase the numbers by increments of 1 as you go towards the middle. When you reach the middle, decrease them by 1. Your lash sample might look like this: 8, 9, 10, 11, 11, 10, and 9. Another example might look like this: 8, 9, 10, 11, 10, 9, and 8. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Understand that each client will be unique.",
      "content": "Understand that each client will be unique. There is no one-size-fits-all when it comes to lashes. Most close-set eye shapes will benefit from a cat-eye effect, meaning the lashes get longer toward the outer corner. Wide-set eyes will look better with a doll-eye effect in which the lashes are long in the center and are feathery rather than dense. There are always exceptions, however, and you should also take into consideration what the client wants. The client is not always right, and sometimes, he or she may request a look that will not look good on them. In these cases, you will need to compromise.

Even though most designs will be longer in the middle segments, sometimes, you will have to make them longer in the outer segments to suit your client's unique eye shape. For example: [6] X Research source Adding longer lashes to the outer corners will create a cat-eye effect and help widen close-set eyes. Adding longer eyelashes in the middle will create a doll-eye effect and help close up wide-set eyes. A combination of shorter lengths and a cat-eye effect will help round or protruding eyes appear less-prominent."

      "content": "Play around with different widths for the segments. Some clients will need equal-sized segments all along the lash strip. Other clients will look better if the segments vary in widths. For example, you could have narrow segments on the outer corners, medium segments on the inner, and wide segments in the middle."

      "title": "Consider adding some longer lashes between each segment.",
      "content": "Consider adding some longer lashes between each segment. Instead of just numbering the segments, number the lines themselves as well. This way, you'll be adding a few longer lashes between each segment. For example, if your lash strip looks like: 8, 9, 10, 11, 10, you could put an 11, 12, 13, and 12 between each segment."

      "title": "Avoid going too long with the lash lengths.",
      "content": "Avoid going too long with the lash lengths. The first and last set of lashes should be close to the client's natural lash length. Shorter lengths will make your client's lashes look fuller. For most people, 11 mm is the longest lash used, but some clients can use 12 and 13 mm lengths. Only use 12 and 13 mm lashes if your client's natural lashes can handle the weight and if the look suits them."
