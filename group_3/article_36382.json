      "content": "Check the care tag to see what your couch is made out of. Couches can be made of fabric, microsuede, polyester or leather , and they have different cleaning requirements. The care tag will say either W, S, SW, or X. [1] X Research source W: wet/water cleaning only. You can use water or vinegar in your cleaning solution. S: dry solvent cleaning only. Use a dry solvent, like baking soda, or have professionals dry clean your couch. [2] X Research source SW: solvent and/or wet cleaning. Use a dry solvent, or vinegar or water. X: professional cleaning or vacuuming only. Reader Poll: We asked 215 wikiHow readers how they prefer to clean polyester, and only 3% of them said a professional upholstery cleaner. [Take Poll] There are lots of simple DIY methods that can effectively clean polyester and other upholstery instead."

As long as your couch’s care tag says W or SW, you can just toss the covers in the clothes washer.

      "content": "Spot-clean stains with steam. Check the care tag of the couch to verify if you can steam clean it. If the care tag says that you use water to wash your couch, then it’s safe to use steam. Set your iron on the steam setting and run it over stained places on the couch. [5] X Research source Steam can dissolve a lot of stubborn materials and leave your couch looking clean."

      "content": "Mix your own deodorizer with white vinegar. Check your couch’s care tag if you’re not sure what material it is, because you’ll need to make a slightly different deodorizer depending on what type of upholstery you have. For all of them, mix the ingredients in a spray bottle, and make sure to use plain white vinegar, not white wine vinegar. For fabric upholstery, mix .5 cups (120 ml) white vinegar, .5 cups (120 ml) rubbing alcohol, and 1 cup (240 ml) of water. [6] X Research source For leather upholstery, mix .25 cups (59 ml) white vinegar and .5 cups (120 ml) olive oil in a spray bottle. [7] X Research source For synthetic upholstery, mix .5 cups (120 ml) white vinegar, 1 cup (240 ml) of warm water, and a splash of dish soap in a spray bottle. [8] X Research source For any of the mixtures, you can add some drops of lavender essential oil or lemon juice to freshen up the scent. Give the bottle a good shake, and you’re ready to spray. You can also use a store-bought deodorizer if you don't feel like making your own. Products like Febreze work on most couch materials (except for suede and leather)."

To make the experience more pleasant, crack open your windows and turn on a fan. [9] X Research source If you can, deodorize your couch on a sunny day, so that you can have the windows open, and so the couch will dry more quickly."

      "content": "Spritz the couch lightly with deodorizer. Hold the spray bottle about 1 foot (30 cm) away from the couch as you spray, so that you don’t accidentally soak the upholstery. You just want to lightly spritz it. If there is one spot in particular that’s emitting the bad odor, focus on that part of the couch. If you can’t localize the bad odor, then spray the entire couch. The vinegar might leave a lingering smell, but after a few hours it will dissipate. [10] X Research source"

If the couch is leather, you can use wiping motions, because the leather is more water-resistant.

If you’re in a dry climate, just let sunlight come through the window and it will dry your couch in no time. If you’re in a humid climate, point a box fan at the couch for a few hours to speed up the process.

If something really smelly has just gotten on your couch, like pet pee or blood , the first thing to do is to blot it up as quickly as possible with paper towel or a clean rag. This will give the stinky stuff less time to absorb into your couch. Use dabbing, blotting motions, instead of rubbing motions, so that you don’t rub it further into the couch."
