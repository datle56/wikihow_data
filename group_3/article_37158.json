      "content": "Call 911 if you feel you are in immediate danger. If your stalker is nearby or is threatening you or your loved ones with violence, seek emergency assistance immediately. If possible, do what you can to move to a safe place where your stalker can't get to you. Tell the 911 operator everything you possibly can about the person stalking you, their location, and your location. If your stalker is not immediately nearby, let the 911 operator know that you also need protection where you are. Don't try to talk yourself out of calling 911 or convince yourself that you're overreacting. If you believe you are in immediate danger there's no reason to take unnecessary risks."

Even though your first instinct may be to eliminate all traces of contact with your stalker, any messages or gifts they send you can be used as evidence of their stalking behavior. If you have no evidence that a crime is occurring, police won't be able to do anything to help you. Your stalker also may commit other crimes, such as property damage or assault. Evidence you should save includes: [2] X Research source Written messages, texts, emails, or messages on social media (screenshot or save) Any gifts or other items your stalker sends to you Photos of any damage your stalker has done to your property Recent call history on your phone Any other evidence of stalking behavior"

      "content": "Take names of any witnesses to the stalking. Friends, classmates, coworkers, neighbors, and even family members who've been there when your stalker contacted you can help support your story. Ask them if they would be willing to tell the police what they saw or heard. If they agree, write down their name and contact information. [3] X Trustworthy Source US Office on Women's Health U.S. government agency providing resources for women's health Go to source It can also help to have them write down exactly what they saw or heard while their memory is still fresh. Any legal case could take months to develop and they may forget specific details of the incident in that time."

      "content": "Keep a journal of all stalking incidents. Every time the stalker attempts to contact you or engages in other stalking behavior, write down the date and time of the incident along with a brief description of what occurred. If you have evidence, such as a saved voicemail message or an email, make a note of the evidence you have for that particular incident. If there were any witnesses to the incident, write their names and phone numbers in your log of the incident. The Stalking Resource Center has a form you can use to record information about stalking incidents available to download and print for free."

As long as you don't feel you're in any immediate danger, take your evidence to your local police station and ask to report the stalking in person. Tell your story to the officer who takes your report and show them the evidence you have. [4] X Research source Organize your evidence in chronological order before you go. Make copies of any physical evidence that you intend to hand over to the police. If possible, take a friend or relative with you who can corroborate your story as well as provide you with emotional support. If the officer you speak with seems dismissive or doesn't seem to be taking you seriously, ask to speak to someone else. Most local police departments have at least one officer who specializes in talking to and working with victims of abuse."

      "content": "Ask for a copy of the written police report. The officer you reported the stalking behavior to will produce a written report summarizing everything you said. It may take a day or two for the final report to be complete. However, you should be able to at least get the report number so you can come back and get a copy of the written report. [5] X Research source When you get the report, review it carefully. If there is anything that doesn't seem accurate to you or doesn't express what you said to the officer, mention it and get it corrected. Get the name and badge number of the officer assigned to your case.

Look for a government agency or nonprofit organization in your area that helps people who are victims of stalking or domestic violence. They will have resources you can use. They'll also help you protect yourself and your loved ones from any possible harm. [7] X Research source The police department may be able to give you the names and contact information for programs that could assist you. Domestic violence shelters and programs can typically provide you with advice and support even if your situation is not domestic. For example, if you're being stalked by a former coworker with whom you never had a romantic relationship, you should still be able to get help from these organizations."

However, if you need an order to keep your stalker away from you and the courts are not open, you may be able to get an emergency restraining order through your local police department. [8] X Research source Emergency orders typically only last until courts are in session and you have the opportunity to seek a temporary or permanent restraining order. Pay attention to the dates that your order will be in effect. In some states, you may have up to a week, but others only give you a few days. In some states, emergency restraining orders are limited to situations where you've been immediately threatened, such as if the police are called to the scene of an incident involving you and your stalker."

Even if they don't, you still typically need to prove that a restraining order is warranted. A judge won't automatically grant you a permanent restraining order just because your stalker isn't there to contest it. After hearing all the evidence, the judge will decide whether to make your restraining order permanent. You can get a written copy of your permanent restraining order in the clerk's office. The judge may decide not to make your restraining order permanent. You have the right to appeal this decision.

Keep in mind that in extreme cases, your stalker may dye their hair or otherwise disguise their appearance to try to get close to you without being recognized. Make sure your neighbors know about your stalker so they can report if they see your stalker lurking or snooping around your home.

[18] X Trustworthy Source US Office on Women's Health U.S. government agency providing resources for women's health Go to source Continue be vigilant about what you post on social media even after you block your stalker. Someone who still has access to your account and is friends with them could report back information. Don't post personal information that would give away your whereabouts. Avoid posting pictures or information about trips you take or events you attend until after you've returned. Turn off tagging so people can't tag you in photos or posts they create.

      "content": "Alter your routes to work or school. Particularly if your stalker is local, they may try to follow you as you go about your routine. Come up with different ways to get to the places you regularly go or leave at different times during the day. For example, if you have to be at work at 9:00 a.m., you could leave some mornings at 7:30, others at 8:00. If you're reliant on public transportation, consider leaving early and taking a roundabout rather than a direct route. Try to vary your other errands as well. For example, if you go to the same grocery store every Saturday morning, occasionally go to a different store or do your shopping on a different day. You don't want your stalker to be able to reliably predict where you are or where you'll be on any given day."
