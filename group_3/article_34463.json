      "content": "Banish negativity by focusing on the here and now. Take time to engage with the world around you. Observing the different sensations you experience is a great starting point, like the sights, sounds, and smells of your environment. Try to keep an open mind as you embrace life with this more intentional, negativity-free approach—when you truly live in the present, it's much easier to focus on the positives.

Take time to note and count all the different items in your periphery, whether you're in class or at work."

      "content": "Imagining a shield around you can help in moments of high stress. Shielding visualization techniques can help empaths and introverts block out toxic energy in real time. Close your eyes and visualize a beautiful white shield completely surrounding your body, or surround yourself with soothing white or pink light. Think of this “shield” as your own private bubble where toxic energy can’t reach you.

      "content": "Tidy up the areas where you spend time to reduce chaotic energy. Our physical environments influence and reflect how we feel inside, so living (or working) in a messy space may actually be contributing to your stress and draining your energy. Work on decluttering areas where you spend a lot of time for a quick boost of mental clarity and positive energy. Try to create a neat and comfortable sanctuary for yourself at home. Even if you’ve had a hectic day at work, knowing you have a refuge to go home to can make a huge difference."

      "content": "Promote positivity by making physical space for it in your life. Think about spots in your home where you feel the most relaxed and positive, whether that's your bedroom, kitchen, or somewhere else entirely. Add items to this space to make it even more soothing and calming, like scented candles, soft blankets, or fluffy pillows. Whether you're having a good or bad day, spend some time in this space to recharge your positive vibes. [4] X Research source Fill this space with colors that you really like, whether that's a light purple, deep red, or soothing green. Add a potted plant of vase of flowers to your special sanctuary to give it an extra special touch."

      "content": "Carve out time for breaks to replenish your energy . Remember that life is a journey, not a sprint. If you're firing on all cylinders 24/7 without taking adequate time to refuel, you'll deplete your energy. Give yourself permission to rest when you need to! How often you need breaks (and what those breaks entail) is different for everyone, so go with what works for you. [5] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Business Review Online and print journal covering topics related to business management practices Go to source For example, take frequent 5-10 minutes breaks during your workday to prevent burnout. Even a quick walk around the building or block can help! On weekends, devote larger blocks of time to rest. Be sure to honor your needs—an extrovert might feel recharged after spending time with others, but introverts may need to spend some time alone to feel fully refreshed."

      "content": "Focusing on what you're grateful for can shift and protect energy. When you’re in a situation that feels toxic, it’s easy to focus on the negative until it completely drains you. Practicing gratitude is a powerful tool for combating negativity, and you can do it anywhere! Get in the habit of making gratitude lists when you’re feeling energetically tapped out. [6] X Research source Showing kindness and appreciation also helps, especially in group situations when you're around a lot of people (like at school or in the workplace)."

      "content": "Monitor your feelings and honor them instead of pushing them down. It's easy to repress anxiety so you can power through your day (especially when you're at work). Keep in mind, though, that mental stress eventually manifests in physical ways. Ignoring your emotional needs will eventually zap your energy and leave you feeling thoroughly drained. If you're constantly feeling fatigued, irritable, or generally overwhelmed, it's time to decompress.

      "content": "Work on asserting yourself and saying no when you feel overloaded. It’s easy to overextend yourself, whether it’s at work, in your relationships, at school, or all of the above. Instead of agreeing to take on that extra project or social engagement, really think about what you do (and don’t) have the bandwidth for. It's perfectly okay to set boundaries and say “no” to conserve precious energy. [9] X Research source Pay attention to how you feel before taking on something new; does the prospect truly excite you, or do you instantly feel stressed just thinking about it? When you’re dealing with toxic people or negative coworkers, remember that “No” is a complete sentence and you don’t have to explain yourself. Try to avoid getting involved in office drama and limit your time around negative workers. [10] X Research source"

If you habitually overextend yourself, or if it always seems like there just aren't enough hours in the day, organizing your schedule can help.

And while multi-tasking is a great tool, constantly juggling email notifications, instant messages, meetings, and phone calls usually ends up being more exhausting than productive. To keep your energy up and really get things done, take steps to reduce the noise in the background. [12] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Business Review Online and print journal covering topics related to business management practices Go to source Try things like: Block off time in your schedule to work on one thing at time. Set your Slack status to “do not disturb” or “heads-down mode.” Close any browser tabs, windows, and applications that you aren't using. Silence your phone or tuck it in your desk drawer so that it's out of sight."

Devices allow you to do so many creative and productive things, but they can also steal your focus and demand more energy than you realize. Unplugging from technology completely for an hour (or more) a week can help, but if you can’t fully disconnect, try changing your notification settings so you can control what you’re seeing (and when).
