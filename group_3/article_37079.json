      "title": "Turn off the water supply valve and flush the toilet.",
      "content": "Turn off the water supply valve and flush the toilet. Find the water valve behind and below the toilet tank and turn it clockwise. Professional plumber James Schuelke says the best way to drain the tank is to flush the toilet and then use a wet vacuum to remove the small amount of water sitting at the bottom of the tank. If you don’t have a wet vacuum, use a sponge, towel, or turkey baster. The water valve is usually located where the water pipe comes out of the wall. The hose coming out of the valve attaches to the bottom of the toilet tank. When you flush the toilet, the water flows from the tank into the bowl. Since the water valve is off, no water will flow back into the tank."

      "content": "Unscrew the hose under the tank and remove the fill valve. Remove the tank lid and set it on a towel. The toilet fill valve is inside the tank, usually off to one side. Loosen the nut on the bottom of the tank under the fill valve by turning it counterclockwise with an adjustable wrench or pliers. Drain the hose into a plastic bin. Unscrew and pull the old valve assembly out of the tank. [1] X Research source Put the plastic bucket or bin under the nut to collect any dripping water. Place the old fill valve inside the bin to collect any water that leaks out after you pull it out of the tank. In newer toilets, the fill valve is the plastic column that includes the float and the on-off lever for filling. In older toilets, the float is a separate piece but is connected to the top of the fill valve. The fill valve also has a small refill tube attached to it that drains into the overflow pipe."

      "content": "Buy a new fill valve that’s the same type as the old one. Go to your local hardware store and purchase a new toilet fill valve that matches your old one. Most new toilet fill valves are universal, meaning they will fit in almost any toilet. Check your toilet’s manufacturer to see what kind of fill valve it uses. [2] X Research source Older models might have one of these fill valves: Plunger or piston fill valves: These have a plastic or brass cup with a rubber lip that separates two chambers inside the valve. [3] X Trustworthy Source U.S. Department of Energy Official site for the U.S. Department of Energy, which provides resources related to energy safety, conservation, and efficiency Go to source Diaphragm fill valves: Diaphragm valves have a rubber disk that separates the two chambers and opens and closes to control the water flow. [4] X Trustworthy Source U.S. Department of Energy Official site for the U.S. Department of Energy, which provides resources related to energy safety, conservation, and efficiency Go to source Float-cup (ballcock) fill valves: This type of valve uses a plastic cup or ball filled with air to regulate how much water fills the tank. [5] X Research source Floatless fill valves: These don’t have a seal or ball—instead, floatless valves have a pressure-sensing device that controls the flow of the water. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Place the fill valve stem into the hole at the bottom of the tank. Remove the new toilet fill valve from its packaging and read the directions it comes with. Adjust the height of the valve so that the top sits 1 in (2.5 cm) below the top of the overflow pipe. Insert the small refill tube into the overflow pipe. [7] X Research source Most kits include a clip that holds the refill tube and attaches to the top of the overflow pipe. This prevents the tube from dipping below the water line and siphoning the water in the tank. If the old valve is the same model as the new one and its base is in good condition, you may not need to remove the old valve. Just pull up on the lock ring at the bottom, slide it off the base, then remove the base on the new valve and attach the tube to the old base."

      "content": "Slide any included washers onto the fill valve stem and attach the nut. Consult your kit’s instructions to see how many washers to attach onto the fill valve inside and outside of the tank. Slide the fill valve through the hole in the bottom of the tank, push it down slightly, and screw any washers and the included nut onto the valve’s stem. [8] X Research source Washers on the inside and outside of the tank ensure that there is a water-tight seal around this connection point. Make sure the nut is only finger-tight. Tightening the nut on the bottom of the fill valve with a wrench or pliers could crack the toilet tank or the valve stem."

      "content": "Screw the hose onto the valve stem and turn on the water supply valve. Once the replacement fill valve is in place, it's time to get the water flowing again. Attach the supply line to the bottom of the new fill valve and tighten it with a wrench. Turn on the water by turning the water supply valve counter clockwise until it stops rotating. Check all your connections for leaks Be careful not to overtighten the supply line, or the nut could crack and the connection will leak. If you see any leaks, immediately turn the water off at the supply valve. Tighten the leaking connections. If the connection still leaks, it may need to be reinstalled or replaced. When you turn the water on, the tank will start filling right away."

      "title": "Adjust the float on the new fill valve.",
      "content": "Adjust the float on the new fill valve. Adjust the float on your new toilet fill valve so that the water is 1 in (2.5 cm) below the top of the overflow pipe. [9] X Research source The float's location can be adjusted with a clip on its side, a set screw at the top of the float shaft, or by adjusting a screw at the top of fill valve where the float attaches. Look at the directions for your new toilet fill valve for exact directions for float adjustment. Positioning the float 1 in (2.5 cm) below the overflow pipe will ensure that it shuts off the water before it gets high enough to flow over the top of the pipe."
