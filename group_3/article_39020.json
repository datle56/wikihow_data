If possible, find a flat lawn without many slopes, patches of uneven ground, or other obstructions. This croquet setup is popular all around the world, and is used for tournaments in the U.K. and Commonwealth."

You may also use a stick, rock, or any other noticeable object. For a more precise boundary, tie a length of string between them."

Starting from one boundary marker, walk at a right angle to the first line while measuring with the tape measure. Once you reach a distance 1.25 times as long as the short side, stop. If you are using a full size garden croquet field, your field's measurements will be 14m x 17.5m. Other possible sizes include 10m x 12.5m (33ft x 41.25ft) or 7m x 8.75m (23ft x 28.75ft)."

[2] X Research source Place the two prongs of the hoop firmly into the lawn so the hoop stays upright. The prongs should be placed parallel to the shorter sides, so you can look through the hoop if you stand on the shorter side.

However, for inexperienced players or less than perfect lawns, a smaller size is recommended. Try 30 ft. (9.1m), 25 ft. (7.6m), or any other measurement that fits.

One way to locate the center of the field is to stretch two strings across the field diagonally, each one between opposite diagonal corners. At the location where the strings cross, drive the two prongs of the hoop firmly into the ground to create an arch. The opening should face toward the short ends of the field. Alternatively, measure the center points of one short side and one long side, then have two people walk at right angles from each point. The point where their paths cross is the center of the field."

It does not matter where actual compass north is; this is just terminology to make the court easy to describe. The longer sides are the \"west\" and \"east\" sides, as if you were looking at a map with the \"north\" end of the field at the top. The players will be starting on the \"south\" side of the court. However, the players move back and forth across the entire court, so even if the ground is sloped it won't make much difference which end is which."

[3] X Research source Otherwise, scale down this measurement to the same proportion as your field's side, or simply walk approximately 3/5 of the distance to the north end while counting your paces. Walk in a straight line, parallel with the long sides of the field. The 9 hoop game has several variant setups with the hoops at different distances from the center hoop.

You normally only get one hit on your turn (but see below), and you do not get to hit a ball with the mallet if it doesn't belong to your team, so the players should rotate as well, alternating between the two teams.

The goal of the game is to get your team's balls through the hoops in a particular order, and in the right direction through that hoop. You might want to use colored clothespins or clips that match the balls' colors to keep track of which hoop you are aiming for next. In 6 hoop croquet, the order is: northward through the two western hoops, southward through the two eastern hoops, northward through the two center hoops. In 9 hoop croquet, the order is: northward through the two southern hoops, then in a northern zigzag through the eastern and center hoops, northward through the two northern hoops, hit the northern stake, then work your way in the same pattern southward. Use the western hoops instead of the eastern when going back southward. End by hitting the southern stake."
