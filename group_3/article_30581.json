[2] X Research source A lot of your favorite veggies and fruits are mostly made of water—in fact, the water is about 90% of a veggie’s total weight. When these veggies get popped in the freezer, the water expands as it freezes. [3] X Research source For instance, a ½ cup of raw asparagus weighs 2.36 oz (67 g), while the frozen variety weighs 3.17 oz (90 g)."

      "content": "Defrost your frozen veggies in the refrigerator before cooking them. While you can definitely cook with frozen veggies, experts often recommend thawing them out beforehand, so they don’t lower the temperature of your dishes during the cooking process. You can leave certain frozen veggies, like bagged corn and peas, on the counter for a few minutes instead of defrosting them overnight. [4] X Research source It’s not a good idea to add completely frozen foods to dishes like stews or soups, since they’ll lower the temperature of the dish. Then, you may overcook the food while you wait for the temperature to rise again. You can simply rinse bags of frozen peas and corn under cold water instead of thawing them overnight. Always thaw and wring out frozen spinach before you add it to any dishes. [5] X Research source"
