[3] X Trustworthy Source FamilyDoctor.org Family-focused medical advice site run by the American Academy of Family Doctors Go to source Apply moisturizer to your skin at least once a day.

After taking a bath, rub lotion on your skin before fully drying off, concentrating on your hands and feet. Doing this will lock the moisture from your bath into your skin, keeping your skin hydrated and less likely to become itchy."
