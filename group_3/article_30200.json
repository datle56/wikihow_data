      "title": "Get an apple and a pen.",
      "content": "Get an apple and a pen. This pipe is considered \"pure\" because all you need to make it is an apple and stick-like device, such as a pen, with a tip sharp enough to poke a hole in the apple. Make sure the apple you use is fresh. A soft apple could collapse while you're trying to bore the holes. It's ideal to use the type of ball-point pen with a tip you can unscrew so you can take out the ink well. Otherwise, you may spill ink all over the apple. Once you take out the ink well, screw the tip back on. Don't use a pencil. It's likely to break inside the apple while you're trying to make a hole with it."

    {
      "title": "Remove the stem from the apple.",
      "content": "Remove the stem from the apple. You can use your fingers to twist or pull it off or cut a slit around the stem to remove it. Make sure you get the entire stem; if it breaks, dig into the hole with your fingers and remove it from the base. [1] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Bore a hole through the top of the apple.",
      "content": "Bore a hole through the top of the apple. Place the pointed tip over the hole where the stem used to be and jam the pen into the apple at a slight angle. Push it into the apple until you've made a hole that extends about halfway through the apple. If the apple is difficult to push through, it may help to use a twisting motion as you push. Once you make the initial hole with the pen's tip, you can remove the pen, unscrew the tip, and use the tip-less pen to push into the apple. The apple will slide into the hollow pen. When you're finished making the hole, remove the pen and discard the apple piece."
    },
    {
      "title": "Bore a second hole near the bottom of the apple.",
      "content": "Bore a second hole near the bottom of the apple. It should be about half an inch from the hole at the apple's base. Insert the pen and poke a hole that meets up with the first hole you poked."
    },
    {
      "title": "Bore a third hole on the side of the apple.",
      "content": "Bore a third hole on the side of the apple. Insert the pen into the apple an inch or a little more from the top hole. Push the pen into the apple until the third hole meets up with the chamber system you have created. This hole will serve as the carb, so it should be in a place that is convenient to cover with a finger while you're lighting the pipe. [2] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Make a bowl.",
      "content": "Make a bowl. Use the pen or another object to carve out a hollow shape on the top of the apple where the first hole was drilled. Make it big enough to hold the material you want to smoke."

      "content": "Use the pipe. Fill the bowl with the material you want to smoke. Hold the apple in one hand with your finger covering the carb, the small hole on the side of the apple. Use your other hand to light the bowl, and suck in with your mouth through the hole near the bottom of the apple. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Get an apple, a knife, a spoon and a pencil. For this method you will need a few extra supplies, but the pipe is easy to make and the result looks more neat."

    {
      "title": "Cut off the top of the apple.",
      "content": "Cut off the top of the apple. Place the knife about half an inch below the stem and slice off the top of the apple. Take the stem out of the apple's top. Don't cut off the top too close to the stem. The top of the apple will be made into the bowl, and you want it to be sturdy. You may have to wiggle the stem out to dislodge it. Try not to damage the top of the apple."

    {
      "title": "Carve the chamber.",
      "content": "Carve the chamber. Use a spoon to carve a circular chamber out of the base of the apple. Run the spoon through the flesh around the edge of the apple, so that you create a circle about 1 ⁄ 3 inch (0.8 cm) from the edge of the apple. Dig the spoon into the apple to remove the flesh from inside the circle and down to about 1 ⁄ 3 inch (0.8 cm) from the base of the apple. Don't get too close to the sides or the bottom of the apple when you're working with the spoon. The pipe won't be sturdy unless the apple has enough flesh left to hold its structure. Use a knife to help you break up the flesh in the middle of the circle if it's difficult to remove it with the spoon. Score it a few times with the knife, then dig around the scores with the spoon."

      "title": "Make the carb and mouthpiece.",
      "content": "Make the carb and mouthpiece. Hold the base of the apple in your hand. Use the pencil to carefully poke a hold about an inch below the rim of the apple. This will be the carb. Poke a second hole a few inches to the side of the carb to make a mouthpiece."

    {
      "title": "Use the pipe.",
      "content": "Use the pipe. Place the lid back on the apple. Fill the hole at the top of the lid (where the stem was) with the material you want to smoke. Hold the apple in your hand and cover the carb with your finger while you place your mouth over the mouthpiece. Use your second hand to light the pipe while you inhale."
