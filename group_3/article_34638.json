      "content": "“Psycho eyes” usually refer to a cold, empty, and prolonged stare. Saying someone has “psycho eyes” has very little to do with the size, shape, and color of them. Instead, “psycho eyes” are typically used to describe a cold, distant, blank, and/or prolonged stare without blinking. This association between psychopathy and unnerving gazes is largely based in pop culture and media, not necessarily backed by scientific evidence. [1] X Research source Psychopaths are often portrayed as staring at others in this bizarre, detached way, signaling a lack of empathy at best and an intention to harm at worst. Many famous fictional psychopaths have made the empty, emotionless stare a part of their character, like Patrick Bateman in American Psycho . Someone staring too intensely can also be associated with having “psycho eyes,” along with people who shift their eyes frequently during conversation. The official diagnosis for those who exhibit psychopathic behaviors is antisocial personality disorder (ASPD) , although the term “psychopath” is often used informally to refer to the same mental disorder."

      "content": "You can’t identify a psychopath by their eyes, but pupils may offer clues. Although having an unsettling, intense stare doesn’t constitute a psychopath, recent research shows that the pupils may reveal more about a person’s potentially cruel intentions than we originally thought. A 2018 study conducted by the Cardiff and Swansea University concluded that criminals classified as psychopathic had pupils that did not dilate when shown disturbing images, although their pupils did dilate when shown pleasant images. This implies not that psychopaths feel no emotion, but that they are desensitized to disturbing or negative factors. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Psychopaths are actually less likely to maintain eye contact. A study conducted by the American Psychological Association in 2020 sought to examine the behaviors of known, incarcerated psychopaths. They discovered that those who scored high on the psychopath scale were significantly less likely to meet the interviewer’s gaze when sitting across from them at a table, both when speaking or listening. This might be explained by the fact that eye contact fosters connection, and psychopaths are innately inclined to avoid forging personal bonds with others. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Lack of empathy",
      "content": "Lack of empathy This one of the main predictors of psychopathy, as psychopaths are virtually incapable of feeling or caring about what others feel, including sorrow, sympathy, or remorse. This is part of what allows them to treat others callously and cruelly, since they have little to no regard for their victims’ emotions. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Pathological lying Everyone lies, whether it be to get out of doing something or to avoid hurting a loved one’s feelings. However, this is not the same type of lying a psychopath does. Lying over and over again, seemingly without reason, hints at a pathology, or a psychological abnormality, which is often present in psychopaths. Being deceitful is certainly in a psychopath’s nature. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Outwardly charming Famed serial killer Ted Bundy might be one of the most well-known cases of a charming psychopath, although he’s definitely not along. Psychopaths can “mask” their true selves, often appearing charming, charismatic, and outgoing. However, this behavior typically comes to an end once they’ve gotten what they’ve wanted, and you might even be able to spot the switch."

      "content": "Narcissistic Since psychopaths are unable to form real connections with other people, they consider no one except themselves. Psychopaths often have an inflated sense of self, firmly believing in their superiority above others. They will even go as far as demanding special treatment, and this high level of narcissim may be coupled with other pathological symptoms, like delusions of grandeur. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "“Sanpaku eyes” refers to eyes with three visible white parts.",
      "content": "“Sanpaku eyes” refers to eyes with three visible white parts. In Japanese face reading, the term “sanpaku” translates into “three whites,” and seeks to assign certain personality traits based on which white parts of the eye are visible. These white areas are called sclera and most people only have two white areas visible, on both sides of the iris. However, “sanpaku” specifically defines people with three visible sclera: the two side areas, plus one on top or one below the iris. There are two kinds of sanpaku: yin sanpaku eyes and yang sanpaku eyes. [7] X Research source Yin sanpaku eyes have a visible white area underneath the iris, while yang sanpaku eyes have a visible white area above the iris. Those with yin sanpaku eyes are believed to lead lives marred by tragedy, while people with yang sanpaku eyes are considered to be more violent and aggressive. There is no scientific evidence that suggest any truth to these beliefs, and extra white around the eyes can be explained by certain eye conditions, sagging eyelids due to age, and surgery."

      "content": "What they’re feeling Eyes are said to be the windows to the soul. Perhaps that’s because eyes can truly reveal our innermost feelings and thoughts. Recent studies show that eyes and eyebrows reflect emotions most accurately, clearly indicating whether someone is happy, sad, angry, or suspicious. Understanding how a person is feeling based on their eyes is essential to communication, understanding, and forming deeper, stronger community bonds. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Underlying conditions Certain changes to the eye can can point to underlying conditions, like liver problems, low hemoglobin, and allergies. A person’s eyes can also hint at other issues and behaviors. For example, having red or bloodshot eyes could be related to stress or fatigue, and engaging with any kind of mind-altering substances can affect the size of the pupil, giving away the fact that they’re intoxicated. As it turns out— the eyes say it all."

      "content": "If they’re telling the truth Shifty eyes are typically associated with lying, although there’s not a ton of science to support this as liars come in all shapes and forms. However, pathological lying is one of the main signs of ASPD and diagnosed psychopaths are unlikely to keep eye contact, strengthening the connection between avoiding someone’s gaze and harboring potentially harmful intentions."

      "content": "Don’t try to diagnose a psychopath based on their eyes. The pop culture idea of “psycho eyes” refers mainly to an emotionless, unsettling stare– but this quality alone doesn’t make someone a psychopath. There’s actually very little science linking eyes to psychopaths in general. While it’s natural to rely on visual and body language clues to uncover another person’s true intentions, someone who appears to have a “dead,” “distant,” or “soulless” stare does not constitute a psychopath by any means, so it’s best not to make assumptions. [9] X Research source Certain conditions like, ADD, ADHD, and autism, can affect a person’s eye movements, so avoid assigning anyone unnecessary and likely inaccurate psychological diagnoses. Antisocial personality disorder (ASPD) is the correct term for people who demonstrate psychopathic qualities. It’s essentially impossible to tell if people have ASPD or not simply by looking at them, although studies do show that pupil dilation and eye contact can hint at psychopathic behaviors. Behaviors in people with ASPD can vary significantly, as some people are able to experience remorse and can nurture connections with loved ones, further invalidating blanket diagnoses based on appearances."
