      "content": "Review GoFundMe's policies. GoFundMe has specific policies that prohibit fraudulent, misleading, or deceitful campaigns. However, some situations that may seem suspicious to you are not actually considered fraudulent on the platform. [2] X Research source Familiarizing yourself with the policies can help you submit a stronger report. If you can point to a specific policy issued by GoFundMe that the campaign violated, GoFundMe will be more likely to take action."

      "title": "Gather information about the fraud.",
      "content": "Gather information about the fraud. While you need the URL of the campaign at a minimum, it isn't enough merely to direct GoFundMe to that campaign and tell them it's fraudulent. GoFundMe will be more likely to investigate the campaign if you have substantial, concrete evidence that the campaign organizer is attempting to deceive donors. [3] X Research source Gathering information may require you to go beyond the campaign page itself. For example, you may have found out through checking the organizer's Facebook page that they live in a different state than the beneficiary and are not related to them in any way. Keep your information factual instead of speculative, opinionated, or personal. A campaign isn't fraudulent, for example, just because you've had a disagreement with the organizer or know them personally and believe they aren't trustworthy."

      "title": "Contact GoFundMe directly.",
      "content": "Contact GoFundMe directly. Once you have the information necessary to support your allegations that the campaign is fraudulent, you can give that information to GoFundMe directly on the website. If your report is legitimate, GoFundMe staff will investigate and possibly shut down the campaign.

      "title": "Provide contact information.",
      "content": "Provide contact information. You cannot submit an anonymous complaint to GoFundMe. The platform requires you to provide your name and telephone number, as well as the email address associated with your GoFundMe account. [5] X Research source GoFundMe will not provide your name or information to the campaign organizer to protect your privacy. However, if their investigation reveals criminally fraudulent activity, they may have to share your information with law enforcement for follow-up."

      "title": "Describe the fraudulent activity.",
      "content": "Describe the fraudulent activity. As you click through the GoFundMe form, you'll have space to provide factual details regarding why you believe that particular campaign is fraudulent. Include as many specific details as you can. [6] X Research source Avoid speculation or opinion. If you received information from someone else, at a minimum you should include their name and their relationship to the campaign organizer. If you made any attempts to contact the campaign organizer, include a summary of those attempts and any response you received. Let GoFundMe know if you or anyone close to you has donated to the campaign, and what amount."

      "title": "Submit your report.",
      "content": "Submit your report. Look over your report carefully to make sure everything you've submitted is accurate, and proofread for typos. You will receive an acknowledgement that your report was received. However, GoFundMe will not contact you to follow up on your report or provide you an update on the investigation. [7] X Research source You can always monitor the campaign page itself to see if donations are closed or if the page is taken down. You may be contacted by law enforcement if the GoFundMe investigation reveals evidence of a crime."

      "title": "Document evidence of the campaign and any fraudulent activity.",
      "content": "Document evidence of the campaign and any fraudulent activity. If you don't have enough evidence that fraud is taking place, law enforcement simply won't have enough to go on. You want to have enough evidence that law enforcement will at least launch an investigation. [8] X Research source Generally, you should be able to show that the organizer intentionally misrepresented the facts in some way, and that they did so to try to take advantage of people's generosity and charitable spirit. If you have evidence that the person never in fact used the funds they raised for their stated purpose, that can be helpful too. Start by taking screen captures of the campaign page itself and any other websites where you found information, such as the organizer's website or other campaigns the organizer opened on other crowdfunding platforms. Make copies of any other information you have, such as email or other communication with the campaign organizer."

      "content": "File a police report with local law enforcement. Particularly if the campaign organizer is local, you may want to report the fraud locally. In most cases, your local police won't do anything if the organizer is located elsewhere. However, you can still file a report if you wish. [9] X Trustworthy Source United States Department of Justice Official website of the U.S. Department of Justice Go to source Even if the organizer is located far away, local police may get involved if the campaign purports to benefit local victims, or if significant numbers of people locally have donated to the campaign. If you file a police report, make sure you get a copy of the written report and keep it for your records. It may be helpful when filing complaints with other law enforcement agencies, and can help them coordinate their efforts."

      "content": "Evaluate the relationship between the organizer and the beneficiary. The moment a tragic story hits the news, fraudsters may attempt to capitalize on the event by setting up crowdfunding pages to raise money for the victims. A campaign is more likely to be legitimate if the organizer is closely related to the cause the campaign claims to benefit. [13] X Research source Typically a legitimate organizer will explain how the money raised will be distributed to the beneficiaries. If they claim to be working with a local person or organization, you can easily contact that person or organization to see if they know anything about the campaign. If the person lives far away from the beneficiaries of the fund, and there is no mention on the campaign page of the person's connection to those beneficiaries or how they plan to get the money to them, that's a red flag."

      "content": "Read through donor comments. If the campaign is legitimate, you'll typically see donations and comments of support from people who are close to the beneficiaries. You might also see comments or messages from the beneficiaries themselves. [14] X Research source When a legitimate campaign starts, the first donors and comments typically will be people very close to the people or issue the campaign is intended to benefit. If all of those donors seem to be random or have no connection to the beneficiaries, that may be a red flag."

The fact that someone has no background doing this sort of thing, or that this is their first GoFundMe campaign, isn't necessarily a red flag. [15] X Trustworthy Source Consumer Reports Nonprofit organization dedicated to consumer advocacy and product testing Go to source However, if you're suspicious you can do a search online for the organizer's name and see what you uncover. It may not necessarily be evidence of fraud, but if the person seems shady, the campaign may not be legit. For example, the person may have a link on the campaign page to their Facebook. When you click on it, you notice very few personal comments or connections. The whole page seems to be nothing but advertisements to donate to the campaign, and it was only created a few weeks before the campaign started. That could be a red flag."

      "title": "Fact-check the information provided on the campaign page.",
      "content": "Fact-check the information provided on the campaign page. Sometimes, a fraudster will overstate the gravity of a situation to attempt to get more money out of donors. Particularly if the campaign is tied to a recent disaster or traumatic event, it should be fairly simple to find objective reporting of the incident online. [16] X Research source Beyond overstating the facts, it may also be that the campaign organizer is flat-out lying about the reason they're seeking donations. For example, they may claim to be raising money for someone who was recently diagnosed with cancer, when in fact that person is completely healthy."

GoFundMe provides a method for sending a message directly to the organizer of the campaign – simply click the envelope icon next to the organizer's name. [18] X Research source Be careful about taking on an accusatory tone. Keep your communication polite and cordial. Copy or screen-cap your message before you send it so you have a record of the exchange. If you don't receive a reply from the organizer within a few days, check the activity on the page. If they've been active since you sent your message, that means they've seen it and have chosen not to respond. In that case, you may want to either send a more stern follow-up message or go ahead and escalate your complaint to GoFundMe directly."
