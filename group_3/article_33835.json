      "content": "Sunnah prayers are prayers that are encouraged, but not mandatory. The major Sunnah prayers take place either before or after the Fard prayers, with additional ones taking place on other occasions. These prayers can be considered supererogatory, meaning that they go beyond what is required by the Islamic faith. [1] X Research source The holy Qu’ran reminds us of the importance of prayer: “Verily, Salah restrains (oneself) from shameful and unjust deeds…\" (Quran 29:45)."

In Islam, prayer is said to be the act that is dearest to Allah. It is said that praying the Sunna prayers everyday is an act that will be rewarded greatly. [2] X Research source Umm Habibah narrates: “The Prophet (ﷺ) said: If anyone prays in a day and a night twelve rak'ahs voluntarily (supererogatory prayer), a house will be built from him in Paradise on account of these (rak'ahs).” (Sunan Abi Dawud 1250)"

      "content": "Witr Salat This prayer can be performed any time after Isha. Some scholars regard this prayer as mandatory, and not optional, although it is not as grave a sin to miss this prayer as it is to miss a Fard prayer. To pray Witr , you can perform any odd number of rakat, such as 3, 5, 7, or 9. 3 is the most common number of rakat performed. After performing Witr, it’s customary (but not obligatory), to offer the following dua, although you can substitute it with another if you prefer: “Allahumma ihdini feeman hadayt, wa a’fini fiman afait, wa tawallani fiman tawallait, wa barik Li fima atait, wa qini sharra ma qadait, fa Innaka taqdi wa la yuqda Alaik, wa innahu la yadhillu man walait, tabarakta Rabbana wa ta’alait.” Meaning: “O Allah guide me among those You have guided, pardon me among those You have pardoned, befriend me among those You have befriended, bless me in what You have granted, and save me from the evil that You decreed. Indeed You decree, and none can pass decree, and none can pass decree upon You, indeed he is not humiliated whom You have befriended, blessed are You our Lord and Exalted.”"

For indeed You have power, and I am powerless; You have knowledge and I know not; You are the Knower of the unseen realms. O Allah, if You know that this matter is good for me with regard to my religion, my livelihood and the end of my affair then decree it for me, facilitate it for me, and grant me blessing in it. And if You know that this matter is not good for me with regard to my religion, my livelihood and the end of my affair then turn it away from me and me from it; and decree for me better than it, wherever it may be, and make me content with it.”"
