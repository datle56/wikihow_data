    {
      "title": "Decide what their name is going to be.",
      "content": "Decide what their name is going to be. Remember that you can have an imaginary friend at any age. It can be a real name or a dreamy name, or it can be a creative name that you made up yourself. It can be anything you want, from Zach to Frookipops, and since you're essentially creating this person, you can be as frivolous as your heart desires. A suggestion, however, would be to make sure you can remember the name easily."
    },
    {
      "title": "Decide what their personality is like.",
      "content": "Decide what their personality is like. Are they mean, or funny? Or nice and random? You decide! Come up with a special power or characteristic for this person. It's what will make them fun. Give them flaws, but make sure their personality will make them side with you almost all the time. Try taking a look at book characters for ideas. They can give you personality and novel ideas. Also, think about what you'd want in a friend, and then incorporate it! Just remember that they can be whatever you want. A human, a beast, a flying carpet, or a spirit, it doesn't matter."
    },
    {
      "title": "Figure out what they look like.",
      "content": "Figure out what they look like. Draw them, write a description, or just make a picture in your mind. Do they have black hair or pink? Are they wearing a dress or a tux? Be creative and make up a style! If you have The Sims, or a Wii (the Mii Channel), you can create them on there. Or make them at the South Park Studios website, or WeeWorld (WeeMee), or design them in apps like Gacha Life / Gacha Club!"
    },
    {
      "title": "Picture what their life is like.",
      "content": "Picture what their life is like. For example, decide what school they go to. Do they go to your school in a special class for imaginary friends? Or do they go to the Secret Academy For Imaginary Friends? This is up to you. They don't have to go to school if you don't want them to."
    },
    {
      "title": "Have a conversation.",
      "content": "Have a conversation. How do you and your friend talk when you're not with each other? Are you telepathic? Or do you write imaginary letters?"
    },
    {
      "title": "Give them a birthday.",
      "content": "Give them a birthday. You have a birthday, so why not give your imaginary friend one too? Select a month, a day, and a year to decide when your friend's birthday is. Don't forget to celebrate it too!"
    },
    {
      "title": "Give your imaginary friend a family history and back story.",
      "content": "Give your imaginary friend a family history and back story. Like a real person, your imaginary friend has some history, it gives the friend growth."
    },
    {
      "title": "Do things that you enjoy with your imaginary friend.",
      "content": "Do things that you enjoy with your imaginary friend. If you like books, go to the library and read together. If you like video games, hook up your game console and start killing zombies! The possibilities are endless. Have an adventure with your new friend. Go somewhere exotic (real or otherwise), somewhere that you've never been, and share stories of your findings. Write an imaginary diary about all the wonderful places you've been. Hold a conversation ! If you can't talk to him or her, you essentially won't be friends. An imaginary friend will never tell anyone your secrets or talk about you behind your back so tell them anything."
