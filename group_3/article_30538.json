      "content": "Military remembrance In the aftermath of the deadly battles of World War I, the resilient poppy flower was somehow able to grow in the war-torn fields. When Canadian brigade surgeon John McCrae saw a cluster of these poppies, he was inspired to write “In Flanders Fields,” a poem paying homage to the brave soldiers who had lost their lives. In the following years, the poppy became a universal symbol of remembrance for fallen soldiers. [1] X Research source McCrae’s 1915 poem is written from the perspective of the soldiers who have died in battle, and the famous final line reads, “We shall not sleep, though poppies grow / In Flanders fields.” [2] X Research source In the U.S., many people wear the red poppy on Memorial Day (the first Monday in May) to honor the sacrifice of fallen soldiers. People in the U.K., Canada, New Zealand, Belgium, France, and Australia often wear the poppy on Remembrance Day or Armistice Day (November 11) to commemorate the anniversary of the end of WWI.

      "content": "Death Poppies are sometimes associated with death in general, which makes sense considering their connection to fallen soldiers. These flowers are often etched into tombstones, along with the words “rest in peace,” to represent eternal sleep. Some mourners also bring bouquets of poppy flowers to place on the graves of loved ones who have passed away. [4] X Research source"

[5] X Research source With this in mind, it’s no surprise that poppies commonly represent sleep. One famous instance of this symbolism occurs in the The Wizard of Oz (1939) when Dorothy, Toto, and the Cowardly Lion fall asleep in a field of poppies.

Elphaba (also known as the Wicked Witch of the West) uses her magical powers to make a bouquet of poppies float in the air, releasing their sedative effects and causing her classmates to fall asleep."

      "content": "Hope & peace Although poppies are associated with heavy topics like death and remembrance, they can also represent peace and hope. The poppy flower is technically a weed, which is why it can grow in barren and neglected areas like battlefields. [7] X Research source Its ability to thrive in the face of destruction represents resilience and hope for the future, even after tragedy. And, since the flower is worn to commemorate the end of WWI on Armistice Day, it's also seen as an emblem of peace. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Ancient Greek mythology Poppies were associated with Morpheus, the god of dreams, which makes sense given their symbolic connection with sleep. They were also associated with Demeter, who is thought to have consumed poppy tea to calm herself after her daughter Persephone was abducted by Hades. As Demeter was the god of agriculture and the harvest, poppies later sprang up from her footsteps. [9] X Research source The flowers were also thought to be found in the cave of Hypnos (the god of sleep and Morpheus’ father). They were associated with Nyx, the goddess of night, as well. [10] X Research source The ancient Greeks were also aware of the poppy flower’s medicinal effects, and they often used it as a pain reliever and sleep inducer. [11] X Research source"

      "content": "Poppies make a beautiful (and low-maintenance) addition to any garden. Since the flowers are so resilient, it’s usually pretty simple for beginner gardeners to grow them . Here are some tips to follow: Sprinkle your poppy seeds evenly over a raked garden bed, and press them into the soil lightly (they need light to germinate, so don’t cover them entirely), then gently water them. [16] X Research source Poppies can grow in most soils, but it’s ideal to plant them in well-drained soil in full sun. [17] X Research source Poppies are best sown in fall, since they need the cool winter weather for germination, but they can also be sown in early spring. Once the plants establish roots, they’ll only require minimal watering to make sure the soil doesn’t get too dry (about once per week). [18] X Research source If you want to harvest poppies for a bouquet, cut them at the cracked bud stage (right when the bud is just starting to split open). The flower will keep opening after it’s cut, and it should stay alive in a vase for 5-7 days. [19] X Research source"
