      "content": "Get Plan B. Plan B is a hormone based emergency contraceptive available in Canada and the United States that prevents ovulation and fertilization if taken within 72 hours of unprotected sex. The hormone in Plan B is called progestin, or levonorgestrel. Plan B is available over the counter at most pharmacies or from your medical provider. You do not need a prescription for Plan B, and it is not covered under most medical insurance plans. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Ask your doctor for Ella.",
      "content": "Ask your doctor for Ella. Ella is a synthetic pill (made of ulipristal acetate) that works much the same as Plan B but can be effective up to 5 days after sex. Because of this, it is a bit more likely to be effective at preventing pregnancy than Plan B. [4] X Research source Ella requires a prescription from a medical provider. [5] X Research source Ella reduces the risk of pregnancy after unprotected sex by approximately 75%. There is no current evidence that Ella causes abortions. The \"abortion pill\" (RU-486, or mifepristone) is only available with a prescription. While both drugs do interact with progesterone, they do so very differently. The dosage in Ella is not high enough to cause an abortion. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Ask for the pill by name.",
      "content": "Ask for the pill by name. Do not assume the pharmacist or medical provider will know what you are asking for. Pills currently available in the US are Plan B (also called My Way, Next Choice, or Take Action), and Ella. In Canada, you can ask for Plan B (also called Option 2, Next Choice, or NorLevo). Ella is not yet available in Canada. If the professional helping you only hears you say “contraceptive,” she might think you are asking for regular oral contraceptives. Be specific to ensure you get what you need."

You can find a full list at Princeton's Emergency Contraception website. Be sure you are choosing a regular oral contraceptive that has been shown to be effective in preventing pregnancy. Talk with your doctor or pharmacist if you aren't sure. If taken in the proper doses, oral contraceptives reduce the risk of pregnancy after unprotected sex by 75%. This depends on the type of oral contraceptive you have, however."

      "content": "Consider a copper IUD (ParaGard). The copper intrauterine device (aka IUD) is a highly effective form of emergency contraceptive as it reduces the risk of pregnancy by more than 99% if inserted within 5 days of unprotected sex. [7] X Research source However, many offices do not carry IUDs in stock and must order them, meaning it may be difficult to use them as emergency contraception within the appropriate timeframe. The copper IUD works by increasing cervical mucus and repelling sperm. Side effects may include cramping and bleeding between periods. Hormone based IUDs (such as Mirena) do not work as emergency contraceptives but they are an excellent choice of preventative birth control. The IUD can easily be inserted by a professional at a doctor's office or clinic. You do not need to go to a hospital. Having a copper IUD inserted provides the extra benefit of being effective as a regular birth control method if left in place for up to 10 years. However, they may be expensive, so they may not be your first choice."

Be sure to check with a medical professional or pharmacist if you are uncertain how much to take. Take your first dose within 5 days of unprotected sex, then a second dose 12 hours after the first dose.

If you throw up within an hour of taking the emergency contraceptive, call your medical provider to see if you should take another dose."
