      "title": "Intelligent",
      "content": "Intelligent Intelligence is the core trait of the Ravenclaw house. These folks are true intellectuals, and they spend most of their time learning about anything and everything. Naturally, Ravenclaws tend to be some of the best students in their class, but their thirst for knowledge extends far beyond schoolwork—they love learning for learning’s sake. You’ll often find a Ravenclaw with their nose in a book or deeply entrenched in one of their many extracurriculars. Hermione Granger is one of the most intelligent characters in the Harry Potter universe—she was even deemed “the greatest witch of her generation.” So why is she in Gryffindor and not Ravenclaw? The Sorting Hat admitted that she was almost put in the Ravenclaw house, but since she values courage and bravery over knowledge, she aligns more with the House of Gryffindor. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Intuitive",
      "content": "Intuitive A Ravenclaw’s intelligence is much more than just being book smart or memorizing facts—they can be emotionally insightful, as well. They have a deep understanding of how things work and what makes people tick. They’re able to read people and situations with ease, and some Ravenclaws can be quite empathetic—they sense what another person is feeling and what they need. For example, Luna Lovegood is incredibly perceptive, especially when it comes to Harry. She can sense when he needs a friend, and she also intuitively knows when he needs his space."

      "title": "Creative",
      "content": "Creative With key personality traits like intelligence and intuition, it’s no surprise that Ravenclaws are innovative thinkers known for their ingenious solutions and ideas. A Ravenclaw’s intelligence can manifest in many ways, and some Ravenclaws express themselves through creative thinking and artistic ability rather than logic and facts. They also have a knack for building clever inventions and coming up with insightful theories. [2] X Research source Ravenclaw's common room features several musical instruments for Ravenclaw students to play whenever they like, including a harp, lute, and piano. Luna Lovegood is a great example of an artistic Ravenclaw with her handmade vegetable-themed jewelry and the massive mural she painted on her bedroom ceiling."

      "title": "Witty",
      "content": "Witty Most people think of Ravenclaws as super serious students without a sense of humor, so you might be surprised to learn just how funny these folks can be. Despite being an introverted bunch, their quick wit allows them to excel when it comes to hilarious banter and clever retorts. Ravenclaws can be very entertaining when they want to be, and they know how to party. That quiet Ravenclaw from Potions class could absolutely be spotted at an absolute rager—it's rare, but it happens. Ravenclaw and former Minister for Magic, Millicent Bagnold, hosted an impromptu party to celebrate on the night that Harry survived Voldemort’s attempt on his life. When the International Confederation of Wizards reprimanded her, she responded by saying: \"I assert our inalienable right to party.\""

      "title": "Wise",
      "content": "Wise A Ravenclaw’s sharp mind allows them to make shrewd decisions, too. They’re able to see the big picture and make their moves accordingly. Old adages like “wise beyond their years” and being an “old soul” could definitely describe a Ravenclaw. It’s no surprise that Hogwarts students often seek out Ravenclaws for help with their homework, and their knack for being logical makes them great people to go to when you need help making a decision or coming up with a plan."

    {
      "title": "Aloof",
      "content": "Aloof Cerebral Ravenclaws are all about logic and learning—they don’t have a lot of interest in socializing or just “hanging out.” After all, a Ravenclaw has things to do, books to read, projects to start...their schedule is full! Being that mentally focused isn’t necessarily a bad thing, but the overall vibe can come off as a bit cold and aloof to other people. Ravenclaws aren’t acting distant in a malicious way, though—they're just really distracted by all of their thoughts and plans. Professor Flitwick is proof that Ravenclaws can be warm and kind. He was one of the most welcoming Hogwarts professors, and he was happy to praise his students and offer them his support whenever they needed him."

    {
      "title": "Pretentious",
      "content": "Pretentious Ravenclaws value knowledge above all things, and sometimes they like to share that knowledge with others—usually in excruciating detail. They speak with authority and confidence when they're on a topic they know a lot about, so they usually end up sounding like a professor giving a lecture rather than a Hogwarts student. They aren’t trying to make other people feel inferior on purpose, but when they’re in the middle of one of their encyclopedic monologues, it can definitely feel like they’re being a bit condescending and haughty. Ravenclaws have no problem boasting about their wins publicly, as well. The Ravenclaw common room features a rather ostentatious trophy case filled with innumerable plaques, trophies, Quidditch Cups, and more."
    },
    {
      "title": "Judgemental",
      "content": "Judgemental Ravenclaws tend to make snap judgements about people, it’s true, and their hyper logical minds are to blame. To a Ravenclaw, everything is information, and information is meant to be absorbed, analyzed, and mentally cataloged. That doesn’t always leave a lot of room for sympathy! Rather than looking at the nuances of a person or situation, a Ravenclaw will use the information they have to form their opinions before moving on to the next thing. This can come off as pretty judgy to other people."
    },
    {
      "title": "Secretive",
      "content": "Secretive Knowledge is precious to a Ravenclaw, and sometimes they just don’t want to share it. Trying to get information out of an unwilling Ravenclaw can be a little like pulling teeth, and they’re more likely to respond in double-speak and riddles rather than give a straight answer. When it comes to lore and esoteric knowledge that they want to protect, they have no problem completely withholding information—which can be pretty infuriating and off-putting to others. Before entering the Ravenclaw common room, you're required to solve a riddle at the door—which means Ravenclaws are answering riddles as they're coming and going every single day! Being secretive and esoteric is just a way of life for Ravenclaws."

      "title": "Gryffindor",
      "content": "Gryffindor The House of Gryffindor is known for bravery, chivalry, and kindness. They’re courageous and quick to act in dangerous situations, so they don’t always think things through. A Ravenclaw, on the other hand, will never make a move without first analyzing the situation and considering all possible outcomes. A Ravenclaw's logical mind simply won’t allow them to be a reckless hero, and Ravenclaws tend to do what's best for themselves. That doesn't mean Ravenclaws can't be selfless heroes when they want to be. Luna Lovegood is a prime example. There were also plenty of Ravenclaws that put themselves at risk fighting in the Battle of Hogwarts."

      "title": "Hufflepuff",
      "content": "Hufflepuff Hufflepuff traits are almost the exact opposite of Ravenclaw traits: they’re extroverted, empathetic, loyal, and caring. Ravenclaws can be all of those things, of course, but it takes more effort on their part. Unlike Ravenclaw, the House of Hufflepuff isn’t known for its intellect—some consider them to be the “dumb jocks” of Hogwarts (which would make Ravenclaws the \"nerds\" of Hogwarts). Hufflepuffs usually act in the best interests of others, whereas Ravenclaws are more concerned about themselves. That isn't to say Ravenclaws can't be sporty, though! The Ravenclaw Quidditch team is solid and has some all-star players, including Cho Chang."

    {
      "title": "Slytherin",
      "content": "Slytherin The Houses of Slytherin and Ravenclaw have some intriguing overlapping traits, but there are key differences, too. Slytherin folks are ambitious like Ravenclaws, but they’re more cunning about it. Slytherins also forge strong bonds with each other, whereas Ravenclaws tend to isolate themselves in their own little worlds. There’s not a lot of loyalty in the Ravenclaw camp, whereas a group of Slytherins will always stick together no matter what."
