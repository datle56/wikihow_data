      "content": "Take out standard cactus needles using tweezers. If you can see a cactus needle clearly, grip the end of it with a pair of sterilized tweezers and pull it out. To avoid snapping the needle, do your best to remove it in a single, straight motion. [1] X Research source If the needle gets buried deep under your skin, locate the tip furthest away from the entry wound and gently push it out. Sterilize your tweezers with rubbing alcohol or antibacterial soap.

      "content": "Remove tiny cactus needles with duct tape. If multiple, tiny cactus spines are stuck in your skin (such as glochids), place a piece of duct tape or packing tape over the needles. Lightly press it into your skin and then rip the tape off. This gets rid of large amounts of cactus spines at once. [3] X Research source Repeat the process with fresh tape until all of the cactus needles are gone."

      "content": "Pull out stubborn cactus hairs with white glue or rubber cement. Using a cotton swab, tongue depressor, or other small applicator, apply a large amount of white glue (like Elmer’s ) or rubber cement to the pierced area. Let the glue or cement dry, then pull the edges of the adhesive up slowly and carefully. Repeat the process multiple times to remove as many needles as possible. [4] X Research source Your drying time will vary based on which brand of glue or rubber cement you use. You may feel some slight pain as the adhesive dries. To combat this, take a standard dose of an over-the-counter painkiller, like acetaminophen. Another option is to apply hair removal wax over the cactus spines. Smooth on the wax, press on a cloth strip, and then rip off the wax. [5] X Trustworthy Source HealthyChildren.org Health information from the American Academy of Pediatrics. Go to source"

      "content": "Brush off glochids using a nylon stocking . Glochids are thin, hairlike cactus needles that are shorter and less rigid than regular cactus spines. To remove them, put on protective gardening gloves and wad up a pair of nylon pantyhose. Then, rub the hose against the affected area to pull out the glochids. [6] X Research source When dealing with glochids, nylon hose provides all the adhesive power of duct tape without causing any unwanted skin irritation."

      "content": "Dress your wound after getting the needles out. After removing the cactus needles from your skin, clean the pierced area with fresh water and soap for 5 to 10 minutes. Once you’ve removed as much dirt and debris as you can, apply antibiotic cream to the wound and cover the entire affected area with gauze wrap or a bandage. [7] X Research source For safety, wash your hands with antibacterial soap before cleaning the wound. If you see any cactus hairs in the wound site, pick them out using tweezers sterilized with rubbing alcohol or antibacterial soap.

      "content": "Remove small cactus needles using duct tape. Small cactus hairs like to bury themselves in fabric, making them incredibly difficult to remove. However, you can usually get a large portion of them out using duct tape or a similarly strong adhesive. To do so, cover the affected area with a strip of tape, then rip the tape off. Repeat this multiple times for the best results. [10] X Research source"

To do so, grab a fine-toothed comb and place it just above the needles. Then, run the comb down through the needles to brush them off. [11] X Trustworthy Source US National Park Service Agency responsible for the maintenance and promotion of national parks and monuments Go to source Once you’ve removed most of the needles, get rid of any stragglers using duct tape or a pair of tweezers.

Once you’ve removed as many needles as you can, place your clothing items in a washing machine and run them through a normal cleaning cycle. Doing so helps remove any small hairs you couldn’t get out by hand.

These needles may be accompanied by small, hard-to-see cactus hairs, so put on gardening gloves to keep your hands safe.
