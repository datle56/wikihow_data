You can also use a peeler to help scrape off the skins. [1] X Research source You may want to wear gloves as you do this to prevent your fingers from staining. Use a steel cutting board, as beet juice can stain wood, plastic, and marble boards. The skin is edible, but it has a very bitter taste that you may not want in your salad."

If you want to add them to the salad, tear them into pieces with your fingers. Set the greens aside until you are ready to toss the salad. [2] X Research source"

Start at the end where the top was sliced off. Slice the beet into thin rounds. [3] X Research source You can also use a mandoline to create very thin slices. If you want even smaller pieces, slice the rounds in half."

Toss the raw beets in with lettuce, dressing, and your other favorite vegetables. Use sweet and tangy flavors to offset the earthy, bitter taste of the beets. [5] X Research source Add the beet greens now if you want. Lemon dressings, vinaigrettes, and mustard dressings pair well with beets. Kale, arugula, or spinach taste great in a raw beet salad. Sprinkle the beets with chili and squeeze lemon juice on top for a spicy twist. [6] X Research source"
