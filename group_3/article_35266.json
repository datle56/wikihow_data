Each line in the graph will correspond to its own frequency, which will allow you to see how well you heard that frequency. They start low and move higher on the spectrum. [2] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Family Physicians Organization devoted to improving the health of patients, families, and communities Go to source Frequencies commonly range from 250 Hz up to 8000 Hz. Lower numbers represent lower pitched sounds, while higher numbers mean higher pitched sounds."

      "content": "Locate the intensity along the side of the graph. The vertical axis will show you the intensity of the sounds that you heard, measured in decibels. Each horizontal line will correspond with an intensity rate. This is the volume of the sounds. When you were given your hearing test, it started at the lowest intensity rate and stopped when you indicated that you could hear the sound. [3] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Family Physicians Organization devoted to improving the health of patients, families, and communities Go to source Intensity commonly ranges from -10 dB up to 120 dB."

You will see the “X” or square on one of the plotted lines inside the graph. [4] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Family Physicians Organization devoted to improving the health of patients, families, and communities Go to source The line for your left ear is also usually blue.

You will see the circle or triangle on a plotted line inside your graph. [6] X Trustworthy Source Johns Hopkins Medicine Official resource database of the world-leading Johns Hopkins Hospital Go to source The right ear line is usually red. Most audiograms depict just the right and left ears. If you find one line, you’ll know by process of elimination that the second line must represent the other ear."

      "content": "Look for an “S” if you didn’t wear headphones. Most hearing tests will include earphones that produce two results - one for each ear. However, you may also be asked to hear sounds from a speaker. If this happens, you will see an “S” line, which tells you how well you heard those sounds. [7] X Trustworthy Source Johns Hopkins Medicine Official resource database of the world-leading Johns Hopkins Hospital Go to source Results from the speaker test represent how well your stronger ear can hear."

Your right ear will be represented by the \"<\" symbol, while your left is represented by the \">\" symbol. [8] X Trustworthy Source Johns Hopkins Medicine Official resource database of the world-leading Johns Hopkins Hospital Go to source Bone conduction testing could also be shown with brackets, such as [ for you right ear and ] for your left ear. This test is used to determine what is causing your hearing loss, such as damaged nerves or something like earwax blocking the sound waves. Most audiograms will not contain these symbols."

      "content": "Recognize the hearing thresholds. Your audiogram should have shading to indicate the five different thresholds for hearing. Each threshold includes a range of intensity readings. The thresholds range from normal up to profound hearing loss. This allows you to see how well you can hear compared to someone in the normal range. [9] X Research source Normal hearing ranges between 0 to 25 dB. Mild hearing loss ranges between 25 to 40 dB. Moderate hearing loss ranges between 40 to 55 dB. Moderate to severe hearing loss ranges between 55 to 70 dB. Severe hearing loss ranges between 70 to 90 dB. Profound hearing loss requires an intensity above 90 dB."

[10] X Research source Many people with hearing loss are better able to hear lower sounds, meaning that you will may have better results for those frequencies."

    {
      "title": "Focus on one ear at a time.",
      "content": "Focus on one ear at a time. It’s usually easiest to look at one set of results at a time, especially if you have different levels of hearing in each ear. It will make it easier for you to process the results if you are only looking at one line at a time. [11] X Trustworthy Source Johns Hopkins Medicine Official resource database of the world-leading Johns Hopkins Hospital Go to source If they are very close together, however, you may want to look at them together."

      "content": "Look at the frequency first. Start with 250 Hz, which is the lowest frequency. Slide your finger up the chart until you reach the dot. Look to your left to see which intensity that the dot corresponds to. This will tell you the softest sound that you could hear at that frequency. For example, your 250 Hz dot might be plotted on the line that corresponds to the 15 dB intensity. This means that you could not hear that frequency when it was played at a lower volume than 15 dB. The higher the dB, the louder the sound had to be played before you heard it. [12] X Research source"

      "content": "Find the threshold range where each frequency falls. Each plotted point will fall into one of the five thresholds. It’s possible that you could hear some frequencies in the lower range, while others require a volume that falls into one of the hearing loss ranges. [15] X Research source If any of your plots fall into a “hearing loss” range, then you have some hearing loss."

      "title": "Look at the slope of the line for each ear.",
      "content": "Look at the slope of the line for each ear. This will show you what type of hearing loss you have. All hearing loss is not the same. Some people will hear all of the frequencies in the same range of intensity, while others may show only partial hearing loss. While partial hearing loss sounds better, it can still be severe if you are unable to hear certain frequencies. [16] X Research source A sharp slope indicates that how well you hear varies depending on the frequency of the sound. This makes it harder to say what type of hearing loss you have. You may hear lower frequencies at an intensity in the normal or mild hearing loss range, while high frequencies fall in the severe hearing loss range. This would mean you have partial hearing loss. A flatter line means that your hearing is consistent, making it easy to determine which threshold you fall into. You can look at the range of numbers where most of your plots fall, and this will tell you what type of hearing loss you have. For example, if the plots range between 45 and 60 dB, then you would have moderate hearing loss."
