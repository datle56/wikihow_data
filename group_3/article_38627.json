Contact your travel agent, broker, or the airline to ask a customer service representative if your tickets are transferrable if you are unsure.

Speak with the customer service department of the airline to determine if there is a fee and how much you’ll have to pay.

      "content": "Decide if you want to sell the tickets yourself or use a third-party site. Sites like eBay and Craigslist allow you to handle every aspect of the sale. However, you must be wary of frauds and scams, as the responsibility of the sale lands solely on your shoulders. Alternatively, you can use a third-party marketplace site that will handle the details for you and guarantee the sale.

      "title": "Create listings on a classified or auction site to sell them yourself.",
      "content": "Create listings on a classified or auction site to sell them yourself. Once you’ve chosen a site, create a listing with the number of tickets, airline, flight number, date, time, and seat numbers of the tickets that you wish to sell. Include your contact info as well as the price of the tickets and the preferred method of payment—PayPal is a secure and reliable option. Respond to inquiries until you find a buyer that agrees to the price. [4] X Research source Make sure you ask for the buyer’s full name so you can transfer the tickets."

      "content": "Post the tickets for sale on a marketplace site for help from a third party. Register for a marketplace site and create a listing of the available tickets. The site will determine the price for you based on demand, and may charge up to 15% of the selling price for helping you find a buyer. You’ll be notified when the tickets are sold, but the site will hold the buyer’s funds until you transfer the tickets. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Transfer the tickets into the buyer’s name.",
      "content": "Transfer the tickets into the buyer’s name. If you sell the tickets on a classified or auction site, you should transfer the tickets to the name of the buyer once the buyer has paid for the tickets. If you use a third party site, you must change the name and upload the tickets within 72 hours of being notified of the sale. In both cases, you’ll need to reach out to the airline’s customer service department to get the tickets transferred."
