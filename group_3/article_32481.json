      "content": "“Sallallahu alayhi wa sallam” is the Arabic version of “Peace be upon him.” “Peace be upon him” is the English version of the Arabic phrase “Sallallahu alayhi wa sallam” (صَلَّى اللَّهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّمَ). It literally translates to “Blessings and peace of Allah be upon him.” [2] X Research source Example : “Muhammad, sallallahu alayhi wa sallam, was Allah’s chosen messenger.” Abbreviation : SAWS or SAW or ﷺ Both “Peace be upon him” and “Sallallahu alayhi wa sallam” are appropriate to use."

      "title": "Say or write “Peace be upon him” after mentioning any prophet.",
      "content": "Say or write “Peace be upon him” after mentioning any prophet. While “Peace be upon him” is most associated with the prophet Muhammad, Muslims use it after mentioning any prophet or messenger of Allah, like Adam, Nuh (Noah), and Isa (Jesus). If you’re Muslim, you say “Peace be upon him” directly after speaking the prophet’s name or write it directly after referencing him. [3] X Research source Example : “Allah made Adam, peace be upon him, in His image.” Most Muslims say “Peace be upon him” after hearing someone else say a prophet’s name, too. There is also debate about whether you have to say or write “Peace be upon him” after every time you mention the prophet. Some Muslims say it’s okay to only use it once when first mentioning the prophet, while others say you need to use it after each reference. Speak to your imam for guidance on what is considered appropriate when saying “Peace be upon him” and what best practices they recommend."

      "content": "Write “PBUH” or “SAWS” after mentioning a prophet in writing. In writing, many Muslims prefer to use the abbreviation for “Peace be upon him” or “Sallallahu alayhi wa sallam” after they mention Muhammad or another prophet. “PBUH” and “SAWS” still allow Muslims to pay their respects to the prophets, but are often seen as more helpful in writing because they’re less obtrusive and save time and space. [4] X Research source However, there is debate about whether it is appropriate to use “PBUH” or “SAWS.” Some Islamic scholars say you have to write out the full phrase to stay respectful."

      "content": "Saying “peace be upon him” is a practice that’s required by the Quran. The Quran says, “Indeed, Allah showers His blessings upon the Prophet, and His angels pray for him. O believers! Invoke Allah’s blessings upon him, and salute him with worthy greetings of peace” [Surah Al-Ahzab, 33:56]. [5] X Research source So, many Muslims agree that it is mandatory, or at the very least recommended, to pay their respects to Muhammad after mentioning him. However, there is some debate about whether it is considered obligatory to say “Peace be upon him,” or simply recommended: [6] X Research source Some scholars say it is obligatory for Muslims to say or write it every time they mention or hear Muhammad. Some agree it is only mandatory to give Muhammad blessings at least once in a person’s entire lifetime. Some scholars say it is only obligatory to send blessings during prayer. Other scholars say it is recommended to send Muhammad blessings ( mustahabb ) but not obligatory (i.e., not a sin if it’s not said)."

Sending blessings to Muhammad (PBUH) and the other prophets is considered an act of worship of Allah, as He recommends this practice in the Quran [Surah Al-Ahzab, 33:56]. For Muslims, understanding and reciting the Quran are some of the best ways to connect with Allah and strengthen their faith . [8] X Research source Imam Mekaeel Mohsin agrees, saying “the best thing that you can do to get closer to Allah is connect yourself with Him” by “reading [the Quran],” “trying to comprehend it,” and applying “it to [your] daily life.”[v162436_b01]. 3 August 2023"

According to the Sunnah, Muhammad (PBUH) said, “Whoever sends blessings upon me once, Allah will send blessings upon him tenfold and will erase from him ten misdeeds and raise him ten degrees in status” [Sunan an-Nasa'i 1297]. So, when Muslims wish peace and blessings upon Muhammad, they benefit as well. They receive the same kindness back from Allah and earn His mercy for their sins. [9] X Research source"
