It's still pretty rare, but some manufacturers - in response to consumer complaints - are including slits, perforations, and other starting points for opening their clamshell packages on the back. Also look around the sides to see if there are any pop-together tabs that could simply pull apart. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Insert a knife between the two layers of plastic and cut all the way around. Since the blade is inside the package and pointing towards the center, it's much safer than trying to stab through the plastic and wedge the tip in between. With a decent knife, the remainder of the plastic should be easy to cut. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Cut carefully all the way around the edge with the best scissors or box cutters that you can get your hands on, until the package easily opens. Do NOT cut across the middle of the package; you could cut through the instructions or a part of the product, and it's the most cumbersome way to go. Start on the right side of the package, cutting up and around the perimeter, if you are right-handed. If you are left handed, start on the left. [5] X Research source Be willing to quickly admit it if your favorite scissors or knife aren't sharp enough to allow you to cut smoothly and safely. Your uncut hands will thank you later. Borrow or buy a can opener."
