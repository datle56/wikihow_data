When you put the phone away, make sure it’s securely in your pocket or bag before letting go. When you get a new phone, it’s a good idea to check how it feels in your hand. If the phone is too large for you to get a good grip on, try a different model. There are some attachments that you can use to get a better grip on your phone. A ring holder, for example, has a loop to put your finger through while you're holding your phone. There are also rubber attachments to stop the phone from sliding out of your hand. Use one of these if you have trouble holding on to your phone."
