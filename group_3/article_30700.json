      "content": "Add 3 inches (7.6 cm) to each side for a rod above the trim mount. After you measure the width of the window, add 3 inches (7.6 cm) to both sides. This will give you a general sense of the length of the rod you need if you're keeping it just above the curtains, which is the most common style. For example, say your window's width was 30 inches (76 cm). Add 6 inches (15 cm) to get the rod size of 36 inches (91 cm)."

The rod will be the same length as the width of the window. For example, if window's width was 30 inches (76 cm), your rod's length would also be 30 inches (76 cm)."

      "content": "Add 3 inches (7.6 cm) to 5 inches (13 cm) for a rod below the trim. A rod kept below the trim mount can help show off decorative window frames and molds. Rods positioned below the trim mount are generally 3 inches (7.6 cm) to 5 inches (13 cm) longer than the width of the window. This helps provide full coverage, even with the top of the window exposed. For example, say your window's width is 30 inches (76 cm). For a below trim rod, your rod should be 33 inches (84 cm)."

If you're placing the rod below or above the frame, determine precisely how many inches or centimeters off-center the rod will be. For longer curtains, the rod will probably be higher above the window. Rods can be placed anywhere from 6 inches (15 cm) to 12 inches (30 cm) above the window frame. It can help to make a light mark on the wall to determine where your rod will fall."

Later, you'll need to tweak this measurement as you determine curtain type. For example, say the length of the window is 40 inches (100 cm). You want your curtain rod a little higher than the frame, so add 6 inches (15 cm) to this to get a length of 46 inches (120 cm)."

After you've figured out the length of your window, make sure you're positive about where you want your curtains to fall. Sill length curtains usually fall .5 inches (1.3 cm) above the windowsill. Below sill length curtains usually fall about 6 inches (15 cm) below the windowsill. Floor length curtains usually fall about .5 inches (1.3 cm) above the floor. [6] X Research source Also, account for the placement of the rod. For example, say you want below sill curtains. Your window is 100 inches (250 cm) and the rod will be 6 inches (15 cm) above the frame. Add 12 inches (30 cm) to 100 inches (250 cm). Your curtain length should be 106 inches (270 cm)."

If you want more dramatic puddling, you can add on a few more inches or centimeters. [8] X Research source A 5 to 8 inches (13 to 20 cm) puddle will fan slightly across the floor. For a more dramatic puddle, you can add 10 inches (25 cm) or more to your total curtain length. Functional curtains, which are going to be opened and closed frequently, should not have puddling."
