      "content": "Don't confuse love and sex. Sex and love are two separate, complicated issues that often get confused for being the same thing.

Understanding that sex and love are two separate issues can help you feel confident in saying no to sex if you don't feel ready for it. [1] X Research source Simply dating a person does not mean you should feel pressured to have sex.

      "content": "Say \"No\" whenever you choose. Some teens might have already had sex with their partner and may feel that they can no longer say \"No\" in the future. You should understand that you can say no to sex — or other sexual activity — at any time. Even if you have already had sex, either with a former partner or your current partner, you can still say no at any point. [3] X Research source Having sex in the past does not require you to say “Yes” in the future. If you had sex with a previous partner, it does not mean you should be expected to have sex with your current partner."

[4] X Research source Think about how you would feel comfortable saying no. You can say “No” as simply or as detailed as you would like. You don't need to explain yourself or offer excuses. Saying “No” is enough. [5] X Research source Practice statements like, “No, I don't want to have sex,” or, “I'm not ready to have sex.”"

However, understanding why you might want to avoid sex can help you be more confident in that decision. Take a look at some of the following reasons why you might want to wait before having sex: [6] X Research source You don't feel comfortable or ready to have sex. You understand the risks of pregnancy and what that would mean for your future. You know that contracting a sexually transmitted infection is a risk. You might worry about how you will feel after.

      "content": "Talk with your partner. Talking with your partner and expressing how you feel is the best way to let your partner know that you are not ready to have sex. A truly caring partner will listen to your concerns and respect your wishes and how you feel. If you are uncomfortable with having sex, the only way your partner is going to know about your discomfort is if you tell your partner that you are not ready or don't want to. If you feel uncomfortable expressing this to your partner, you can seek out counseling from your school counselor. You can also seek advice from your parents. [7] X Research source [8] X Research source A good partner will be open to hearing your feelings and thoughts regarding sex. If your partner doesn't want to listen to your stance on sex, you may need to reevaluate your relationship."

If you are not comfortable with having sex, then you need to honor your feelings. [9] X Research source Although you may care for your partner's needs, never compromise your own to meet hers. Being pressured into having sex can be a sign that your partner doesn't respect your own needs. You don't need to prove your love to your partner by having sex with her.

      "content": "Make yourself clear. Setting clear boundaries with what you are and are not comfortable with can go a long way in avoiding future issues. Talk with your partner and let him know what is acceptable and what isn't. Making your boundaries clear can help you and your partner feel more comfortable and have a better relationship. [11] X Research source Be aware, too, that it's okay if you're not entirely sure of your boundaries. Just communicate this to your partner and if your partner does something you aren't comfortable with, tell him to stop. Be as clear as possible with your boundaries. Never accept your partner pushing or trying to go beyond your boundaries. It's okay to change your mind. If you are doing something and decide you're not comfortable with it or you don't want to do it anymore, you can tell your partner to stop."

She may try to continue pressuring you into sex or continue bringing it up. A partner who isn't respecting your needs, feelings, and concerns might not be such a great partner after all. The relationship might have to end if your partner isn't listening when you say “no” to sex. [12] X Research source Your relationship may be unhealthy if your partner won't respect your decision to not have sex. Your own values and needs are more important than the relationship continuing.

      "content": "Think about responses. There are a few common ideas that your partner may use to try and convince you to have sex. These ideas can range from comparing your relationship to others all the way up to emotional blackmail. Knowing how to respond to these tactics can help you be prepared and stand strong in your decision to abstain from having sex. Take a look at the following sample dialogue to learn some of the more common persuasion tactics: [13] X Research source ”If you really loved me, you'd have sex with me.” This is emotional blackmail and is a serious sign of disrespect from your partner. You might reply by saying “If you really loved me, you'd respect my choice to not have sex.” ”If you don't have sex with me, someone else will.” A statement like this reveals that your partner cares more about sex than he does for you. You might say “I'm sorry you feel that way. I hope you find someone else then.” ”Everyone else is having sex.” Many teens are actually not having sex, choosing to wait until later in life. [14] X Research source You might reply with “Well, our relationship isn't everyone else's. I'm going to do what's right for me.”"
