While Pikachu has brown stripes on its back and brown fur near the base of its tail, the black stripe on the tip never appeared in any official art. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Yes, the female cosplay Pikachu has a heart-shaped tail with a black tip. In Pokémon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire , players can earn a special female Cosplay Pikachu that can change costumes and learns special moves. To show that this Pikachu is different from a standard one in-game, she has a heart-shaped tail with a black tip. This is the only time Pikachu has had a black tip on its tail, but people still claim it existed before the games released in 2014. [2] X Research source Why does Cosplay Pikachu have a heart-shaped tail? Starting in Gen IV with the release of Diamond , Pearl , and Platinum , female Pikachu were given a heart-shaped tail while males kept a square tip. Besides Cosplay Pikachu, all other female Pikachu still have a yellow tail with a brown base."

      "content": "The Mandela Effect is why people think Pikachu has a black tail. The Mandela effect is when a group of people remember specific details or events that aren't true or never occurred in real life. People may picture Pikachu with a black tail and think their memory or imagined image is real, even though it's not. [3] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source The Mandela Effect got its name from a group of people misremembering Nelson Mandela passing away while he was in prison, even though he was released in 1990 and survived until 2013. Other common examples of the Mandela Effect include: Remembering The Berenstein Bears instead of the actual name The Berenstain Bears Misquoting the Darth Vader line as “Luke, I am your father,” when he says, “No, I am your father” Thinking the Monopoly man is wearing a monocle when he doesn’t have one People thinking Sinbad starred in a movie called Shazaam when they are probably remembering the movie Kazaam starring Shaq"

      "content": "There was unofficial merchandise that gave Pikachu a black tail. Pokémon has been extremely popular since it started, so many people made bootleg products to cash in. Even if there are shirts, cards, or stuffed animals of Pikachu with a black tip on its tail, they were never made by the official Pokémon company."

      "content": "Pichu has a black tail until it evolves into Pikachu. Generation II introduced Pichu, a smaller mouse Pokémon that evolves into Pikachu. Pichu has a smaller tail than Pikachu, but it’s solid black instead of yellow. It might be easy to think that Pikachu keeps some of the black on its tail once it evolves, but it changes to solid yellow instead.

      "content": "People may be thinking of a “Pikaclone” with a black tail. Every Pokémon generation adds an Electric-type rodent that looks kind of similar to Pikachu. Each of these Pikaclones has circular cheek pads and a similar body shape, so it can be easy to confuse them with Pikachu at a glance. A couple of these Pikaclones have black tails, so it’s easy to think Pikachu has one too. [5] X Research source Emolga is a flying squirrel Pokémon introduced in Black and White , and it has a large black lightning-shaped tail. Dedenne is an orange mouse from Pokémon X and Y, and it has a long and skinny black tail. Mimikyu from Sun and Moon isn’t technically a Pikaclone, but it wears a disguise that looks like Pikachu. Its tail has a darker tip, so it may lead people to think Pikachu has a black tip on its tail too."

Even though Pikachu’s tail color is probably the most notable Mandela Effect in the series, a lot of people misremember other details from Pokémon, too. A few of the other details that people don’t remember correctly include: Mew being white instead of pink Psyduck being part Psychic-type when it is only a Water-type Magnemite having the Levitate ability when it only has Magnet Pull or Sturdy Electric-type attacks are strong against Steel Pokémon Psychic-type attacks are strong against Ghost Pokémon This Mandela Effect has some truth to it because a glitch in Pokémon Red and Blue made Psychic-types immune to Ghost attacks, and the only Ghost-types in Gen I were part Poison-type, which is weak against Psychic"
