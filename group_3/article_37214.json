While there's no hard rule about removing the app after deleting your account, you'll want to wait at least 24 hours before signing back up for a new account. Delete the app and wait at least a day (maybe even a few days, if you're willing) before starting the process again. Your 24-hour or more Bumble break is a great opportunity to work on gathering new photos and drafting an irresistible bio for your new profile! You can reinstall the Bumble app easily by downloading it from the App Store (iPhone/iPad) or Play Store (Android)."

When you sign back up for Bumble , it's best to use new profile photos and a fully refreshed bio to get the most of out of your newbie boost. Recycling the same content from your old account likely won't aid in improving your matches, and it might even bring negative attention to your new account from people who've seen you in the past. Happy swiping!"
