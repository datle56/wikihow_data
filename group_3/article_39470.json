      "content": "Let her know that you’ve noticed she is impressive. It’s great to focus on something she is good at or interested in, rather than how she looks. She was born with her appearance, but she earned her accomplishments. Tell her you’ve noticed how friendly she is to everyone, or compliment her on some kind of skill she has, like drawing, singing, or playing a sport. [2] X Research source Be genuine with your compliments. Don’t say it if you don’t mean it. Try saying, “It’s so cool your captain of the soccer team. You must be a great player and leader.” Reader Poll: We asked 439 wikiHow readers how they prefer to let a girl know they think she’s cute, and 63% of them said giving a casual compliment with a light smile.

      "content": "Make a joke to keep the mood light and fun. Don’t worry, you don’t need to be a professional comedian. But making a funny comment is a great way to build a connection with her. If you laugh together, that can show her that you’re interested in having a good time with her. [3] X Research source Try saying something funny about how tough the last English test was."

      "title": "Making physical contact will definitely let her know you’re interested.",
      "content": "Making physical contact will definitely let her know you’re interested. Just make sure you do it in a way that is super appropriate. For example, you could give her a high five if you are both at a sporting event or you could touch her hand while you’re talking to her. [4] X Research source If she seems uncomfortable, make sure to stop touching her immediately. You should always respect other people’s personal boundaries."

      "title": "Use your words and body language so that she gets the message.",
      "content": "Use your words and body language so that she gets the message. Even if you're flirting, she might not get the hint. Maybe you sound friendly, but not romantic . Up your signals a bit, even if it feels awkward. Let your gaze linger longer than usual. Don't just pat her on the hand or arm, let your touch last for several seconds. [5] X Research source Instead of saying, \"That's amazing that you're an architect!\" try something like, \"Wow, brains and beauty! No wonder I was drawn to you.\""

      "title": "This lets her know you’re thinking of her.",
      "content": "This lets her know you’re thinking of her. Try asking a question so that you’re more likely to get a response. This is more effective than just saying, “Hey.” You can shoot her a text asking if she’s ready for mid-terms or maybe to ask her if she’s listened to the new Dua Lipa track. [6] X Research source Try not to freak out if she doesn’t respond right away. She might be busy. If she doesn’t respond at all, try not to take it personally. Just move on."

      "content": "Catch her attention with your flirty comment or message. Social media is a great way to let her know that you're interested. Instead of just \"liking\" one of her posts, leave a comment that will let her know you're thinking of her rather than just scrolling by. [7] X Research source For example, if she posts a pic of her at a concert, write something like, \"I love that band. Let's check them out together soon!\" You can also DM her and ask her out with specifics. Maybe say, \"Great pic of you at that festival. There is a cool band playing in my neighborhood next week. I'd love to take you on a date! If she doesn't respond after a comment or two, quit posting. You don't want her to feel like you're harassing her."

      "content": "Work up your courage and tell her that you like her. It's totally normal to feel nervous, but be brave. You might find out she feels the same about you. Just make sure to choose the right time and place. You don't want to embarrass her in front of other people or catch her while she's rushing to class. [8] X Research source Try saying, \"Hey, I think you're really cool and I'd like to be more than friends. What do you think?\" It's okay to be disappointed if she lets you down. But don't get angry at her. It's important to respect her feelings."

      "content": "Have a plan and make your intentions clear. It might feel a lot easier to just ask her to hang out sometime, but you want her to know for sure that it is a date. She'll also feel flattered if you have an agenda in mind. This will increase your odds of her saying yes! [9] X Research source Say something like, \"Are you free Saturday night? I'd love to take you on a date . Do you want to see a movie?\""

      "content": "Choose a fun date that will let you connect. There can be a lot of anxiety involved in first dates. That's totally normal! Picking a really fun activity can help ease those nerves. Choose something that will give you time to talk, to bond over the activity, and maybe even to touch a little. [10] X Research source If she likes cooking, book a cooking class for the two of you. You can have fun getting a little messy and test-tasting together. Take a dancing lesson. This is a perfect way to have fun and get close at the same time."
