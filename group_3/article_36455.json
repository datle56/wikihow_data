      "content": "Clean very rusty items with white vinegar. White vinegar reacts with rust to effectively dissolve it off of most metals. If the rusty item is small enough, soak it in a bowl or bucket of white vinegar overnight. If the item is too large to soak, pour the vinegar directly onto the rust and let it sit for a few hours. Then, scrub the rust off with a scouring pad , wire brush , or steel wool . [1] X Research source Another option is to wrap the object in rags soaked in vinegar then wipe the rust away. If steel wool is too abrasive, try dipping aluminum foil in the vinegar and using it as a brush to scrub off the rust. Don’t use this method on painted surfaces, as the vinegar may damage the finish."

      "content": "Make a baking soda paste for light rust stains. If the item isn’t too rusty or is made of thin metal (like knives), mix some baking soda with enough water to create a thick paste. Spread it on the metal and let it sit for at least an hour. Then, scrub the paste and the rust off with a metal brush, steel wool, or an old toothbrush. Rinse the metal with water and dry it thoroughly. [2] X Research source The baking soda mixture can be watered down as much as you would like, there is no exact recipe. Another option is to rinse the metal with water and sprinkle plain baking soda onto the rust. Let it sit for about an hour, then scour it with steel wool. In general, cleaning expert Dario Ragnolo says baking soda is a great way to remove rust from appliances: “There are different ways to remove rust from appliances, depending also by how bad the rust is. A mix of baking soda and water with the use of a brusher will help remove the rust. Also, a more aggressive way is to use a product that has oxalic acid in it.” [3] X Expert Source Dario Ragnolo House Cleaning Professional Expert Interview. 13 August 2019. Cleaning expert James Sears recommends a baking soda and vinegar paste to remove rust from pots and pans: “Wash the pots and pans with hot water and let [them] soak in white vinegar, which is acidic. Empty the liquids from the pan and sprinkle baking soda to make a baking soda paste. Scrub this baking soda paste over the rusted areas with the hard side of the sponge.” [4] X Expert Source James Sears House Cleaning Professional Expert Interview. 28 August 2019."

      "content": "Use dish soap and a salted potato on small stains. Potatoes contain oxalic acid, which can dissolve rust. Cut a potato in half, cover the cut section with dish soap, and sprinkle some salt (or baking soda) on it—the salt acts as a mild abrasive to help scrape off the rust. Rub the rusted area with the potato until the rust is removed. [5] X Research source To reapply, simply cut off the used end of the potato and add more soap. This method works well for metal without detailing or relief work. If you have a rusty knife, simply stick it in a potato and leave it there for a few hours."

      "content": "Remove small amounts of rust with a lemon and salt. Lemons contain acids that help dissolve rust, while salt acts as an abrasive to scrub it away. Sprinkle some salt over the rusted area so that it’s thoroughly coated. Then, squeeze fresh lemon (or lime) juice on top. Let the mixture sit for about 2 hours, then use the lemon rind to scrub away the rust. [6] X Research source In most cases, the lemon rind will be strong enough to remove the rust without damaging the metal. If the rust is stubborn, however, try using steel wool or a scouring pad. Alternatively, make a paste by combining 2 parts baking soda with 1 part lemon juice. Apply the paste to the rust and let it sit for at least 30 minutes before scrubbing it away."

Then, rub the surface down with a slice of onion—onions contain amino acid sulfoxides that help break down rust. Finish by rinsing the surface with hot water. [10] X Research source This method may work for other types of metal, as well, but it is particularly useful for removing rust from stainless steel . If you’re attempting to remove rust from a stainless steel knife, try simply running the knife through an onion. Ragnolo says vinegar is also effective on stainless steel, “especially if you have a small object or something you can submerge in white vinegar. After a couple of minutes, remove [the stainless steel] from the vinegar and brush off the rust with an old toothbrush.” [11] X Expert Source Dario Ragnolo House Cleaning Professional Expert Interview. 13 August 2019."

      "content": "Use abrasive tools to scrape the rust off. This method requires a lot more elbow grease, but in some cases, you can effectively remove rust by simply scraping it off. Use tools from your garage like a screwdriver, or rent tools from a local hardware store. Steel wool, for example, is easy to use and is something you may already have in your home. [14] X Research source Use an electric sander to remove rust on large pieces. Always start with the roughest grain and slowly move to finer grains to minimize the roughness of the metal. Any metal tool can be used to scrape metal, but use a fine grain sandpaper afterwards to try to remove any marks the scraping may have made. Car expert Evan Ernst says that steel wool is great for removing light rust from chrome: “A really fine mesh steel wool can polish chrome, and, in the same way, it also can remove really light surface rust. If there's a lot of rust, [though], that's not going to be a good option.” [15] X Expert Source Evan Ernst Classic Automotive Expert Expert Interview. 9 January 2024."

Follow the directions for your rust-removal product, as application may vary. In general, though, these products can be applied by brush or as a bath. Once the product has set for the required amount of time, scrub it away, then rinse and dry the metal’s surface. [16] X Research source Warning: Because of the acids they contain, these products can be harmful to skin. Wear protective gear, like gloves, and always take precautions when using a chemical to dissolve rust. Don’t use aggressive chemicals on delicate appliances or surfaces. Some popular chemical rust removers include the Engineer Rust Remover ZC-28 and Rust-Oleum Rust Dissolver Gel . If you’re specifically looking to remove rust from your bathtub, cleaning specialist Eduardo Peralta says, “First apply an acidic toilet bowl cleaner that cleans lime & rust, hard water, and calcium for 5-15 minutes, making sure it covers all [rusty] areas. Scrub and rinse with soap. If rust persists, a magic eraser might also clean it off.” [17] X Expert Source Eduardo Peralta House Cleaning Specialist Expert Interview. 29 October 2021."

      "content": "Use a rust converter if you intend on painting the metal. Rust converters work to stop rust from eating away any more of the metal. These products are similar to spray paint and act as a primer for a coat of paint. Rust converters do not remove existing rust, however, and instead just prevent the rust from expanding. [18] X Research source This is usually only a good option if you plan on painting over the metal. It will also leave a rough texture under the paint, as you’re essentially just adding a covering to the rust."
