      "content": "Find a leather hole punch that matches the size of the existing holes. Rotary punches are specially made to punch holes in leather, and are the ideal method. They look like pliers with handles, and have several “heads” on a wheel. [1] X Research source Adjust your punch so that the proper head points to the opposite clamp of the punch—the head should snugly fit into one of the existing holes of your belt. Rotary punches have a wheel with many different punch sizes, so they’re the best choice if you want to punch different-sized holes."

      "content": "Measure and mark the location of the next hole with a pen. Use a ruler or measuring tape to find the distance between the center of each hole, then measure the same distance past the last hole. [2] X Research source Dot the leather with a sharp object or permanent marker to guide your punching. Don’t use tape to mark this spot, since tape could damage the leather. If you’re making a belt from scratch, the holes are typically spaced ½\" (1.25 cm) apart for belts under ⅜\" (1 cm) wide, and up to 1⅛\" (2.85 cm) apart for belts above 1\" (2.5 cm) wide."

      "content": "Place the punch over the mark and squeeze the handles. Position the punch directly over the mark you made, making sure it's centered along the belt’s width. Then, just squeeze as hard as you can until the punch pierces through the belt. Clamp one end of the belt and hold the other end taut with your free hand, or ask a friend to hold the belt taut, for an easier and cleaner punch. You may need to wiggle the punch slightly as you squeeze it to pierce the leather. After, use a toothpick or needle to remove any leather scraps from the punch itself."

      "content": "Select a rod punch, awl, or another sharp tool that fits the belt holes. A rod punch is a hollow-tipped rod made specially for punching holes in leather. An awl is a sharp needle-like tool with a handle also made for punching leather. Or, Kim tells us that you may use any other strong, sharp tool, like a thick nail or a Phillips-head screwdriver. Whichever you choose, make sure it matches the size of the belt’s holes—it should fit snugly into the existing holes. If the belt doesn’t have any holes, use a tool that’s about as thick as the arm of the belt buckle that will be inserted through the belt holes."

You’ll be using a mallet to strike the sharp tool through the belt, so place the belt on a work surface like an old wooden table or even on the ground, where you won’t damage the surface.

Make sure it’s centered along the belt’s width. Then, with your dominant hand, strike the handle of the punch straight down with a mallet or a hammer. Aim to pierce the belt in one quick strike, though you may need to strike it multiple times if it doesn’t pierce on the first go."

      "content": "Select a drill bit that matches the size of the belt holes. Kim says an electric drill is a good alternative to more traditional methods. First, choose a drill bit that fits snugly into the existing holes. If the belt doesn’t have existing holes, use a drill bit that’s about as wide as the arm on the belt buckle that holds the belt in place. A brad-pointed drill bit works best for leather."

If your top priority is a comfortable fit, instead of measuring holes, wear the belt and pull it to a comfortable position, then mark the belt where the strap tongue touches it."

[7] X Research source After, roll up a bit of sandpaper (use any grit available) and thread it through the new hole. Twist the sandpaper back and forth a few times to tidy up the hole. Also, use a razor to trim away any scraps or threads that may be around the new hole."

      "title": "Choose a belt that’s 1 size up from your waist size.",
      "content": "Choose a belt that’s 1 size up from your waist size. Julch says to “always go for the belt size that's bigger than your waist size.” Most belts are sized in inches, he says, so choose one that’s about 2 inches up, meaning that if you wear a 32 waist, you should go with a 33 or 34-sized belt. Julch also tells us that a rule of thumb for any new belt is that you should be able to buckle it on the third hole. This gives you room for growth, or shrinking. If you’re making a belt, the same principle applies, but account for added material at the end of the belt. So, if you wear size 30 pants, make it so that one of the center holes on the belt is 32 inches along its length, with a few holes on either side, just to be safe."
