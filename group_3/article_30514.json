      "content": "Push your bed as close to the wall as possible to open up the room. The less you have in the center of the room, the more spacious it will feel. Put your bed to 1 side, against or near the wall, rather than smack dab in the middle. If you prefer the look or functionality of having both sides of the bed open, try to minimize how much space you leave on 1 side. [1] X Research source For example, instead of centering your bed with equal space on both sides, place your bed on the right side of the room, leaving just 1 to 2 ft (0.30 to 0.61 m) between the bed and the wall. Now you have the look you like without sucking up space. If you put your bed up against the wall, pile on plush pillows so that it can serve as a seating area during the day. If your bed is facing the doorway, make sure there’s at least 3 feet (0.91 m) between the foot of the bed and the door. This gives you enough space to open the door without hitting the bed."

      "content": "Pick multipurpose pieces to minimize the amount of furniture in the space. Make your furniture pull double duty by selecting items that have multiple uses. For example, place a stool under a tall nightstand so it can be a desk, too. This helps limit the amount of furniture in your room and saves space. Make your shelves multipurpose by adding hooks underneath them so you can hang coats or bags, too, for instance. Another option is to use a dresser to store things other than clothes. For example, if you don't have room for a desk, keep your supplies and notebooks in the smaller top drawers of a dresser."

      "title": "Order custom-made furniture if you have an oddly-shaped room.",
      "content": "Order custom-made furniture if you have an oddly-shaped room. For rooms that aren’t your standard square or rectangle, have your larger pieces of furniture customized to fit the specific dimensions. For instance, if you have an A-frame room, order a dresser that is the exact height of the lowest point of the ceiling, so it sits snugly in the space. [2] X Research source If your room has a small alcove, for example, get a desk or nightstand custom-sized to fit the width of the area so you're using every available inch. Search for retailers online that specialize in custom furniture or contact furniture stores in your area to see if they offer that option. Be aware that custom furniture will be more expensive than a generic piece."

      "title": "Mount floating furniture on the wall if you have limited floor space.",
      "content": "Mount floating furniture on the wall if you have limited floor space. This provides more room underneath the furniture for storage. You can hang almost any piece of furniture, too, like a nightstand next to the bed, for example, or a long, low shelf as a hanging desk."

      "content": "Hide unattractive essentials, like a trashcan, using other furniture. For things you need in your room, but take up valuable space or just don't look good, keep them out of sight by arranging other pieces in front of or over top of them. For instance, place a small trashcan underneath your desk where your chair sits or tucked in the corner of the room next to your nightstand where it's not easily visible. You can keep your laundry basket in your closet or in a tall wardrobe with closed doors where the basket is hidden."

      "title": "Hang shelves to make the most of your wall space.",
      "content": "Hang shelves to make the most of your wall space. Stack 3 to 4 long shelves above each other to create a faux bookshelf effect or stagger shelving across the length of your bedroom wall to provide more room for storage. Place items on them that you don’t mind being displayed, like books or knick-knacks, for example. You can choose shelves in any material or style to match the vibe of your room, too. For example, natural wood shelves are more rustic chic, while cool metal shelves are edgy and modern. Try lining the top border of your room with super high shelves that are 1 to 2 ft (0.30 to 0.61 m) below the ceiling if you want to keep things out of the way."

      "content": "Turn your headboard into a place to keep smaller items, like books. Take advantage of all the space behind your bed instead of letting it go to waste. Find a headboard that has built-in shelves or cabinets, which you can use as storage. [3] X Research source You can also make your own bookcase headboard by pushing your bed up against a tall bookshelf. Choose a bookcase that's wider than your bed so it looks like a headboard. If you have pieces you want to display, go with a storage headboard that has open shelving. If you don't want people to see your things, opt for one with drawers or closed doors. Pick a taller headboard if you need more storage space."

      "content": "Store items in bins underneath your bed for a hidden solution. If you don’t like the look of visible storage, use the space below your bed to keep things you don’t use as often, like winter clothes and shoes during the summer months. Don’t just shove loose pieces underneath your bed, either. Instead, buy long, low plastic bins or boxes specifically designed for under-bed storage to organize your items. You can also look for a bed frame that has drawers built into the base rather than sliding bins underneath. Put your bed on risers if you want to create more space for storage under it. You can buy risers from a furniture store or online retailer."

      "title": "Organize your closet so you can store as much as possible in it.",
      "content": "Organize your closet so you can store as much as possible in it. If your closet is messy or overflowing, you won’t be able to get the most storage space out of it. Start by decluttering your closet by getting rid of or donating things you no longer want. Then, hang delicate clothes, like blouses or dresses, and install shelves or buy a shelving unit for heavier folded pieces, like pants or sweaters. Use a shoe rack if you want to keep your footwear off the floor, too. [4] X Research source To add more space for hanging clothes, place a 2nd rod underneath the existing one in your closet. For lightweight clothing, you can even use a tension rod, which doesn’t require any tools to install. If you have a very small bedroom, you can also put your dresser in your closet. Not only will it open up your bedroom area, it makes practical sense to keep your clothes in one spot, too. If you don’t have a closet, look for a tall wardrobe that will keep your clothes and shoes out of sight. Or, if you want to show off your pieces for a contemporary vibe, mount a rack on the wall or in the corner of the room to hang your clothes."

      "content": "Paint the walls white or another light color to make the room seem more open. Using shades like cream, pale gray, or pastel blue, for example, brighten up the room and make it appear bigger. Stay away from dark, bold colors, like navy or royal purple, which close in a space. [5] X Research source If you want a less permanent solution than painting your walls, use temporary wallpaper in light colors or patterns. Paint the ceiling the same color as the walls if you want your room to feel even more spacious."

      "content": "Make your space look larger by incorporating mirrors. Place a mirror across from a light source to reflect the light into the room, which brightens up the space so it appears bigger. For example, Lean a mirror against the wall that’s across from the window to make the most of the natural light. Mirrored furniture, like an armoire with mirrors on the doors, is a creative way to open up your room."

      "title": "Hang lights on the wall or from the ceiling to save floor space.",
      "content": "Hang lights on the wall or from the ceiling to save floor space. Instead of taking up precious room with a bulky floor lamp, choose lighting that goes on the wall, like sconces, or hangs from the ceiling, like a pendant light. If you use wall lamps, place them somewhere practical, like by your bed, for example, to use as reading light. If you opt for a chandelier or other type of hanging light fixture, install it so that it hangs no lower than 7 feet (84 in) above the floor. If it’s any longer, tall people may have to duck. For more whimsical lighting, drape strands of fairy lights around the room."

      "content": "Turn storage into fashionable yet functional decorations. In small bedrooms, you may not have a lot of extra space to decorate with pieces that serve no purpose other than looking pretty. To prevent your room from looking bare or boring, find ways to spruce up your storage so it becomes double-duty decor. For example, a glittery jewelry holder not only adds an elegant accent, it also keeps all your necklaces and earrings organized. [6] X Research source You can also display shoes on an open shelf as stylish wall art or artfully arrange delicate bowls filled with odds and ends on top of your dresser, for instance."

      "content": "Keep your decor minimal by highlighting a few well-chosen pieces. When it comes to small spaces, less is more in terms of decoration. Instead of trying to fill every inch of space, pick 3 to 4 of your favorite items, like a couple of picture frames or a cluster of candles to set on top of a dresser, for example. Limiting yourself to a few accent pieces prevents your room from looking cluttered. [7] X Research source Choose decorations that reflect your personality or are sentimental to you to add a personal touch. For instance, display a framed map of your last travel spot or a piece of china from your grandmother."
