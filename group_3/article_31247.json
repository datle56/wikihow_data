To craft an anvil, you will need the following: Three iron blocks - Each iron block requires nine iron ingots, for a total of twenty-seven iron ingots needed. Four iron ingots - These bars bring the iron total to thirty-one. You can create iron ingots by adding iron ore, which is the grey stone with orange-brown spots, into a furnace that has coal in it."

To do so, you'll place the three iron blocks in the top row of the crafting table grid, three of the four iron ingots along the bottom row of the grid, and the final iron ingots in the center of the grid. Take the completed anvil from the slot on the left. On the PE version of Minecraft, tap the black anvil icon on the left side of the screen.

To fish, you'll cast out a line by right-clicking (or tapping, or pressing the left trigger) while facing a body of water with your fishing pole equipped. When your pole's bobber dips below the surface of the water and you hear a splashing noise, you'll press the \"Cast\" button again. You'll likely catch a lot of fish and other junk before you reel in a name tag, since name tags are fairly rare. The Luck of the Sea enchantment can help."
