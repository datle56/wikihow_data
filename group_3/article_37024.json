      "content": "Pay attention when you take the screens out. Some screens only go back in one way, and if you don't put them back in the same way, they aren't going to stay. Look at the screen when you're pulling it out, and mark the top of the screen if you need to. If you forgot to look at the screen when you took it down, pull out another one to see how it goes in place. The spline will always face outward."

      "title": "Start from the top.",
      "content": "Start from the top. It's usually easiest to begin from the top of the window and work your way down. However, as you slide it into place, make sure the pressure clips are falling into the proper track on the right. Most often, the springs should go to the right when looking at the window from the outside."

      "title": "Check the springs or pressure clips if it won't go in.",
      "content": "Check the springs or pressure clips if it won't go in. These springs look like little metal strips that create a curve on one edge. Sometimes, the clips pop out of place. They should be against the outside edge only, not flopping to the left or right."

      "title": "Place 2-part screens in like a puzzle.",
      "content": "Place 2-part screens in like a puzzle. The top screen will have a lip at the bottom that goes over the bottom screen. The pressure clips, if the screen has them, need to be to the right when looking at the window from the outside. Press the pressure clips into the track on the right, then press in the left top corner. Push the screen to the top without pressing in the bottom left corner. Insert the second screen under the top screen's bottom lip with the pressure clips facing right. Push the screen all the way over to the right. Press the bottom left corner in, while still keeping the top screen's bottom corner and the bottom screen's top corner out a bit. Once the bottom left corner is in, press on the left middle part where the corners meet to set it in place."

      "content": "Set in a 1-part screen with the springs to the left from the inside. If you need to put the screen in from the inside, the springs should be on the left. The feathered/pleated edge will go on the top. Slide the top part of the screen out the window, and bring it back flat against the window. Set the screen in the tracks with the springs in place. Lift the screen up the window, and set it in place from the top if you can. To set it in place from the top, press in towards the house at the top corners. You can do this from the outside, or if your house has windows that open from the top and bottom, from the inside."

      "title": "Purchase the materials you'll need.",
      "content": "Purchase the materials you'll need. You can buy spline (the rubber seal), a spline rolling tool, and screen at any hardware store. Typically, you can only by screen in big rolls, which you'll then cut down to size. Fiberglass screen will give you a chance to start over if you mess up. Aluminum will hold up to more, but it tends to take on the shape of whatever you're doing. That means you won't get a chance to try again if you make a mistake. [1] X Research source If you have pets, consider using pet screen, which is meant to hold up to the weight and claws of your pets."

Lay the screen down on a flat surface so you can work on it, preferably a work table that you can screw stabilizers into. [2] X Research source If you need to replace the frame, too, you can buy the sides and corners at a hardware store. Just measure how long the sides need to be, and then pop them together with the corner joints to create the frame. You'll only need to replace the frame if it is bowing severely or rusted out."

The spline is the black rubber seal holding the screen in place. It looks like a black cord, stuffed in the edge of the frame. Use a screwdriver to help pry it up, and then pull it out. Pull up the screen once the spline is out. Grab one edge of the screen and pull it out of the frame. It should come out easily now that the spline is gone. [4] X Expert Source Kevin Turner Commercial Handyman Expert Interview. 15 July 2019. Don't try to reuse the spline. It gets old and brittle after a while. Scan each corner of the frame for a spline end. Once you find the end, slip the screwdriver underneath and pry it up. Slowly pull the entire spline out from around the window frame. The spline may be cut in sections. If this is the case, just repeat the process until the entire spline is out of the window frame grove."

The piece of wood can just be a scrap you have lying around that's at least 2 to 3 inches (5.1 to 7.6 cm) long. You're just using it to brace the frame; don't screw it into the frame. Pull the long side taut against it, and screw in another wooden piece across from it along the other long side. These pieces will keep the frame from bowing in as you work. [7] X Research source While this step isn't absolutely necessary, it does help the frame keep its shape."

Push the tool and screen into the frame's groove. Just do one of the long sides for now. [8] X Research source After you roll the screen in, look down the screen. Make sure that there are no bubbles in the screen. If bubbles are present, remove the screen and roll it back in, ensuring you don't have any bubbles this time. Work from corner to corner. If your screen has lift tabs, small plastic handles to help remove the screen, place them in the track before you pre-roll the screen. You want these tabs to be on the opposite side of the spline, so that when the screen is put back into the window, the pull tabs will be on the inside of the house."

[9] X Expert Source Michael Fox Window Repair Specialist Expert Interview. 1 December 2020. Press the roller tool over the spline, and run it along the edge, pushing the spline seal into place. [10] X Research source Rolling the spline in may take several passes but make sure at the end that the screen is all at the same depth in the track. Take your time with this step. If you go to fast or push too hard, the screen may rip on the inside of the frame and then you have to start all over.
