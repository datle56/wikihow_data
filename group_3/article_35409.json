      "content": "Your partner was perfect in the beginning but now they've changed. People who are controlling or manipulative often start out a relationship seeming like the perfect partner. This is love-bombing , a form of emotional abuse that's meant to cause you to let your guard down so they can influence you or exert control over you. [1] X Trustworthy Source National Domestic Violence Hotline Organization providing lifesaving tools, support, and resources for victims and survivors of domestic abuse Go to source While love-bombing typically happens at the beginning of a relationship, it can also come and go in cycles. Your partner might turn to love-bombing if they sense that you're really upset and potentially going to leave them, for example. Manipulative or controlling partners might also turn on the love-bombing if you attempt to assert yourself or call them out on their controlling or manipulative tactics."

      "title": "Your partner lies or makes excuses.",
      "content": "Your partner lies or makes excuses. For someone who is manipulative, nothing is ever their fault. They're never willing to accept responsibility or admit that they did anything wrong—and they'll lie or distort facts when necessary to make themselves look like the victim. [2] X Research source Typically, they're trying to make you feel sorry for them here so you'll forget about whatever was bothering you. If your partner is controlling, their desire for control could extend to facts themselves, meaning that they'll believe the version of events that puts them in the best light, even if that's not what actually happened."

    {
      "title": "Your partner yells at you or gets angry for little to no reason.",
      "content": "Your partner yells at you or gets angry for little to no reason. When the going gets tough, lashing out is a good way for a manipulative or controlling partner to turn the tables. If they get angry, then everything becomes all about them. They believe that you'll do what you can to appease them, especially if it involves something you don't feel strongly about. [3] X Research source For example, a controlling partner might get bent out of shape over the direction in which you vacuum the floor or the way you load the dishwasher. Because you don't want to cause a scene, you go along with what they want. This sets the stage for them to potentially control you in other ways in the future. This is especially likely if your partner knows that you try to avoid conflict."

    {
      "title": "Your partner ridicules, belittles, or criticizes you.",
      "content": "Your partner ridicules, belittles, or criticizes you. With a controlling or manipulative partner, you might feel as though you can't do anything right. They might also put you down or insult you in front of other people to make you feel embarrassed or ashamed. [4] X Research source For example, your partner might bring up an incident they know was super-embarrassing to you while the two of you have friends over. This uses the vulnerability of that moment against you. Your partner might also put down or insult your long-held beliefs, even if they've known about them from the day you met. Questioning long-held beliefs can cause you to doubt yourself or your perception of the world. [5] X Research source Sometimes this comes from a place of insecurity. Usually, your partner is trying to lift themselves up and make themselves seem better because they've put you down."

      "title": "Your partner questions your memory or denies something happened.",
      "content": "Your partner questions your memory or denies something happened. This is related to control, in that your partner is trying to control the narrative. But it's also manipulative—your partner is trying to get you to doubt your own memory or your own senses. If they can achieve that, they can step in as the authority and control your very perspective of reality. This is commonly referred to as \"gaslighting.\" [6] X Trustworthy Source WomensLaw.org Site associated with the National Network to End Domestic Violence aimed at providing free legal resources and aid to survivors of domestic violence. Go to source Clinical Psychologist Lena Dicken notes that another form of gaslighting is when your partner \"makes you feel like your feelings are wrong.\" For example, you might express that something your partner does makes you anxious and your partner replies that you're crazy or you're over-reacting. [7] X Expert Source Lena Dicken, Psy.D Clinical Psychologist Expert Interview. 5 February, 2021. Dr. Dicken continues that standing up to gaslighting requires \"a sense of confidence and a sense of self-assuredness.

      "title": "Your partner isolates you from your friends and family.",
      "content": "Your partner isolates you from your friends and family. Someone who is controlling likes to isolate you from friends and family so their narrative of events will hold dominance over anyone else's. They don't want anyone calling them out or questioning their actions or their motives. Another reason controlling or manipulative partners may isolate you is because they have an insecure attachment to you and get jealous when you're with anyone else. For example, they might imagine that you're cheating on them with one of your friends or that one of your family members hates them and is trying to convince you to leave them."

      "title": "Your partner makes their love conditional on your actions.",
      "content": "Your partner makes their love conditional on your actions. True love is unconditional—you don't have to do anything in particular, look a certain way, or act a certain way in order to get it. If your partner makes comments about how they'd love you more if you did this or that, that could be a sign that they're trying to control or manipulate you. [9] X Research source For example, your partner might say, \"You know I love you, but I'd love you a lot more if you'd just lose a little weight and stop snacking on sweets all the time.\" A manipulative or controlling partner will often focus on something that you're sensitive about. For example, if you're sensitive about your weight, they might use this tactic to make you feel guilty about eating dessert or spending the evening on the couch watching TV. They might make affection conditional as well. For example, if your partner doesn't like when you wear makeup, they might say, \"You know, I'd kiss you a lot more if you weren't wearing all that nasty makeup.\" Psychotherapist Kelli Miller notes that \"if you're constantly questioning your relationship... or comparing yourself to other relationships,\" that's another sign that your relationship is likely unhealthy.

      "title": "Your partner ignores you when they're angry.",
      "content": "Your partner ignores you when they're angry. The silent treatment is about as emotionally manipulative as you can get. Your partner is essentially taking away any opportunity you might have to reason with them or come to a compromise on whatever the issue is. They typically want you to come to them first and make the sacrifice to appease them, rather than meeting you in the middle. [14] X Research source Sometimes, people use the silent treatment because they want to make the situation all about them. They know that if they withdraw their attention, the other person will miss them and beg them to come back. When that happens, they'll feel like they have the upper hand. This is also tied into the idea of conditional love. A partner who uses the silent treatment is conditioning their attention and affection on getting their way."

      "title": "Your partner is excessively jealous or paranoid about you cheating on them.",
      "content": "Your partner is excessively jealous or paranoid about you cheating on them. Is your partner constantly looking over your shoulder when you're on your phone? Do they give you the third degree whenever you come home from running errands or meeting friends for coffee? Those are the actions of someone who's very insecure about their connection to you and is jealous of the time you spend away from them as a result. In the beginning of your relationship, you might have found little jealous remarks your partner made flattering. But if those little remarks have snowballed over time, you're getting into toxic territory. Excessive jealousy may be due to your partner's personal insecurity or they may have an insecure attachment to you. Either of these things can lead to paranoia that you're going to leave them for someone else."

      "content": "You feel as though you're trapped in your relationship. If your partner has been trying to manipulate or control you for an extended period, they might have convinced you that they're your only option. They might even have led you to believe that no one else would want to be in a relationship with you because you're so difficult to get along with or because you're such a failure. If you start thinking that you don't have any option but to be with your partner, stop and take a moment to remind yourself of all the awesome things you've accomplished on your own—either without your partner or before they entered your life. Your friends and family members can also help you counter this by telling you about all the things they love and appreciate about you—all the things that go into making you the wonderful person you are."

      "content": "Your partner makes threats against you or themselves. When your partner gets angry, they might threaten to leave or threaten to harm you or themselves. This is where you get into serious territory. Always take your partner at their word when they make threats like this and start making arrangements to keep everyone safe from harm. [15] X Trustworthy Source WomensLaw.org Site associated with the National Network to End Domestic Violence aimed at providing free legal resources and aid to survivors of domestic violence. Go to source They might also threaten people you love, your pets, or even things that you love. For example, if your partner threatens to break your favorite coffee mug or throw away your favorite T-shirt, that's a form of emotional manipulation. If your partner threatens suicide or self-harm, that can also be used as an emotional manipulation tactic—but it's best for all concerned to take them seriously.

This can help your partner understand where you're coming from and make them less likely to get defensive. Focus on the issues that have been troubling you. Here are some examples of things you might say: [18] X Research source \"I feel belittled and disrespected when you insult me in front of other people.\" \"I feel frustrated when you refuse to talk to me about why you're upset.\" \"I feel disrespected when you try to tell me what to wear.\""

They may have genuinely not realized that their actions were triggering those emotions in you. When you listen actively , it allows them to feel safe opening up. All of this can pave the way to better understanding between the two of you—and, hopefully, to a healthier relationship down the road. [19] X Research source Clinical psychologist Allison Broennimann notes that some people aren't \"purposefully manipulative in relationships.

      "content": "Set clear boundaries for how you will be treated. It can be tough to set boundaries with a romantic partner, especially if you've never really had any in the past. But boundaries are about respect. When you honor each other's boundaries, you're communicating that you respect each other. [23] X Research source For example, you might say, \"Please don't pressure me to have sex. It makes me uncomfortable.\" If your partner frequently raises their voice when the two of you disagree, you might say, \"We can resolve conflicts in a calm manner. I'm not okay with you raising your voice at me.\""

      "title": "Establish consequences if your boundaries are violated.",
      "content": "Establish consequences if your boundaries are violated. A boundary without consequences isn't very valuable because nothing will happen if your partner violates it. Choose consequences that are proportionate and related to the boundary itself, and enforce your boundaries consistently every time your partner violates them. [24] X Research source For example, if you set a \"no yelling during conflicts\" boundary, the consequence might be that when your partner raises their voice, you take a 30-minute break to calm down before you resume the discussion. If your partner is pressuring you for sexual activity, you might set a consequence that you will sleep in another room if they violate this boundary. For some boundaries, simply saying that you will call them out on it and the two of you will have a talk is all the consequence you need. Don't include something as a consequence (for example, that you'll leave them) if you don't intend to follow through with it."
