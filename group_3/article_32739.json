      "content": "Buy a practice lock to perfect your lockpicking technique. If you're learning to pick tubular locks as part of a hobby and are mainly concerned about technique, purchasing a practice lock may come in handy before buying the real thing. Practice locks show the inside of the lock so you know exactly what you're doing as you pick it. If you're trying to open a specific item and don't particularly care about technique, you don't need to purchase a practice lock."

      "title": "Examine the lock to determine how many pins it has.",
      "content": "Examine the lock to determine how many pins it has. Tubular locks usually have between 6-8 pins, with 7-8 being most common. How many pins the lock has influences what kind of lock pick you will need, so count and record the number before you purchase a lock pick."

    {
      "title": "Clean your lock before you pick it.",
      "content": "Clean your lock before you pick it. Wash dirty locks with soap and warm water to remove dust or debris. If your lock is rusty, try to remove as much as you can before picking it. If your lock is clean, you'll be able to pick it more easily."

    {
      "title": "Slide the pick's needles back and forth.",
      "content": "Slide the pick's needles back and forth. If the picking needles move easily, they will contour well to the interior of the lock and will be useful for picking. Needles that don't move as easily back and forth, however, may be dirty or rusty. Clean your pick and remove any visible rust to eliminate sticking. If you've cleaned your pick and the needles still don't move easily, it may be broken."

      "title": "Invest in a lock pick for the easiest way.",
      "content": "Invest in a lock pick for the easiest way. Because tubular locks are so complex, they cannot be picked in the same way as other locks. Using a lock pick is the only verified way to open a tubular lock without the key so, if you have time to spare, purchase a pick to open your tubular lock. If you're in a hurry, you may be able to pick your lock with a ballpoint pen, but this method is less guaranteed than using a pick."

      "title": "Cut off the end of a ballpoint pen with scissors.",
      "content": "Cut off the end of a ballpoint pen with scissors. Pick a ballpoint pen with an exterior the same diameter as or slightly smaller than the lock's opening. Remove the ink tube from inside the pen, as you will be using the ballpoint pen's exterior to jimmy open the lock. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Cut 4 vertical notches into the back of the pen.",
      "content": "Cut 4 vertical notches into the back of the pen. The notches should run up and along the sides of the pen. These will keep the pen flexible as they slide into the lock. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Slide the pen into the lock's opening. Insert the pen as far as it will go into the lock, using pressure if needed. If the lock seems jammed and will not allow the pen to slide in, try either making the notches longer or cleaning any potential dirt or rust inside the lock. [4] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Shake the lock back and forth.",
      "content": "Shake the lock back and forth. Hold the pen in one hand and the lock in the other and shake both from side to side until the pins loosen. If you hit all of the pins, the lock should open. Try shaking it several timesâ€”if it doesn't open after repeated attempts, you may need to use a lock pick."

      "content": "Make sure that your pick has the correct amount of needles for your lock. The number of needles should correspond to the pins on your lock. If your lock has 7 pins, for example, you should use a pick with 7 needles. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Twist the pick's tightening bolt to loosen it. The tightening bolt should be located on the side of the lock pick. When the bolt feels loose, line the pick up with the lock to make sure that the inner needles are aligned with the lock's pins. Tighten the bolt again after making adjustments when the needles and pins seem to align."

      "title": "Turn the pick to the right.",
      "content": "Turn the pick to the right. If your pick's needles are aligned correctly, this should trigger a spring and open the lock. Twist the pick as far to the right as it will go while pressing towards the center of the lock. If the lock still won't open, try re-adjusting the tightening bolt and trying again."
