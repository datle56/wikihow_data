      "title": "Use an already established mnemonic device.",
      "content": "Use an already established mnemonic device. Some math and physics formulas have mnemonic devices that have been around for a long time. Your teacher might have used a few to teach you the formula in the first place. Use those mnemonic devices to try memorize formulas you have a hard time with. [1] X Research source For example, you might have learned the formulas for sine, cosine, and tangent of an angle with the mnemonic device “SOH CAH TOA.” Here, S ine is the length of the O pposite side over the length of the H ypotenuse, C osine is the length of the A djacent over the length of the H ypotenuse, and T angent is the length of the O pposite side over the length of the A djacent.

      "title": "Make up your own mnemonic device.",
      "content": "Make up your own mnemonic device. Not every formula has a common mnemonic device that you can use. In that case, make up your own! Use the parts of the formula to tell yourself a story or spell out a word that you can remember. [3] X Research source For example, if you're trying to remember that E = mc squared, you could remember it by saying that Elephants (E) are afraid of mice and critters."

      "title": "Use a memory palace.",
      "content": "Use a memory palace. A memory palace is a specific type of mnemonic device that uses visual clues to help you remember things. You should always use the same location, and “travel” through it, looking for the things that will help you remember the formula. [4] X Research source For example, think about the house where you grew up. Say that you're trying to remember that the area of a circle is Pi x radius squared. You can remember it by thinking of your kitchen, where there was always pie on the windowsill, next to two rolling pins."

    {
      "title": "Break down the parts of the formula.",
      "content": "Break down the parts of the formula. If you focus on just memorizing the formula, chances are you won't be able to remember it for very long. But if you understand each part of the formula and how they work together, it can be easier to remember them. [5] X Research source So let's say you know that speed is the amount of time it takes an object to travel a certain distance. So to figure out speed, you need to know how far the object went and how long it took to get there: so divide the distance traveled by the amount of time it took to get there. If you know all this, you can figure out that speed = change in distance/change in time."
    },
    {
      "title": "Review what the formula builds on.",
      "content": "Review what the formula builds on. Most physics and math formulas build on things you've already learned. If you're having trouble memorizing new formulas, go back and review the formulas that came before. [6] X Research source For example, say you're having a hard time remembering the formula for velocity, but you know velocity is an object's speed in a specific direction. Review the formula for speed, which is distance over time. Then you know that velocity is just speed with a direction attached."
    },
    {
      "title": "Practice each formula.",
      "content": "Practice each formula. The more you practice with each formula, plugging in different values, the more you'll understand how it works. Understanding how it works can help you to remember the formula itself. Practicing each formula will take a bit of time, but it's worth it, especially if you have a big exam coming up, or if you're going to need these formulas for your career. You can find practice questions in your textbook, or search for practice tests online. If you're having a hard time find extra questions to practice with, ask your teacher for some."

    {
      "title": "Relax.",
      "content": "Relax. If you're super stressed out or worried you won't be able to learn the material, you're going to have a hard time remembering those formulas! Before you study, sit down at your desk. Take a deep breath, letting each of your muscles relax. [7] X Research source If you find yourself feeling overwhelmed, put your work aside, and take another deep breath. Give yourself a break to relax a little bit."

      "title": "Eat a light snack.",
      "content": "Eat a light snack. If you're hungry or thirsty while you're trying to study, you're going to be distracted. If you're distracted, you'll have a harder time concentrating and you probably won't be able to memorize things as well. Keep a light snack, like fruit, and some water near you while you study.

      "title": "Exercise after you study.",
      "content": "Exercise after you study. It might sound a little weird, but exercising after you study can help you memorize formulas better. The endorphins your body releases during exercise actually help improve your memory, so take a walk or go for a run when you're done studying.

      "content": "Get enough sleep. It's important to get enough sleep before and after you study so your brain can remember what you've studied. You should get at least 8 hours of sleep a night, in a room that's dark."
