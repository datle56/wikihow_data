      "content": "A pump cover is oversized clothing that hides your muscles at the gym. They’re the same baggy hoodies, sweaters, and t-shirts that many people wear to lift weights, but the specialized name emphasizes a muscle-pumping phenomenon that naturally occurs when you lift weights. Both men and women wear pump covers to the gym. Men typically wear them to cover up their abs, biceps, and triceps. Women may try to conceal their glutes and upper thighs in addition to their abs, biceps, and triceps."

      "title": "A pump cover warms up your muscles and promotes muscle pump.",
      "content": "A pump cover warms up your muscles and promotes muscle pump. A muscle pump happens naturally when you lift weights. As your body warms up, the water balance in your muscles changes, causing more blood to stay in your muscles instead of flowing away like normal. And, the spaces between the fibers in your muscle swell, making your muscles appear larger and firmer for up to 72 hours. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Weightlifters use pump covers to hide or show off their gains.",
      "content": "Weightlifters use pump covers to hide or show off their gains. Gains is a term new gym-goers use to describe the quick increase in their muscles’ strength and size during the first 6-12 months of working out. Some lifters take off their pump covers after they feel “the pump” to show off how their muscles are growing. Others feel more comfortable using the oversized clothes to cover their gains and retain their modesty. [2] X Research source New weightlifters experience almost instant gains due to a huge boost in their bodies’ muscle protein synthesis (MPS) and hormones like testosterone, HGH, and DHEA. Their bodies aren’t used to such intense exercise, so they respond more sensitively to it in the first few months of consistent workouts. Wearing a pump cover can also boost your confidence when you work out at the gym, as it covers your body and protects you from other people’s judging eyes."
