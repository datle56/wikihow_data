      "content": "Orange tabbies are said to be friendlier and sillier than other cats. The stereotypical orange cat is more affectionate, funnier, and weirder than other cats. Orange cats are also considered chattier, so much so that the owner is able to understand their meows . Many feel orange cats are strong-willed, and there’s some evidence that they are more likely to engage in risky behaviors that get them in some precarious (and sometimes hilarious) situations. [1] X Research source Owners feel the orange cat’s affectionate nature and strong love of treats make them more trainable. In spite of their trainability, some believe orange cats, also known as ginger or marmalade cats, are not as smart as other cats and jokingly claim that all orange cats share one brain cell. [2] X Research source However, others believe orange cats are very intelligent and can learn to open doors. Expert Animal Communicator Mari Cartagenova says, “They say that all orange cats share one brain cell. So they said they're kind of like the dumb blondes of the cat world, but that's not true. I have one, and he's very smart.”"

      "content": "“Orange cat personality” has become a popular internet meme. The Orange Cat Behavior” meme, also known as Orange Cats Share One Brain Cell, references the idea that orange cats are less intelligent, more affectionate, and more chaotic than other cats. Social media posts about orange cats have been posted since at least 2019 when Twitter user @ulat_bulu_bulu shared a post captioned “Orange cat is the crackhead of cat.” In December of 2021, Redditor throwawayorangecat posted on the /r/AmIthe*sshole subreddit about the adventures of an orange cat named Jorts that went viral. In 2022, the meme spread to TikTok. Users began to share videos about orange cats sharing one brain cell between them."

      "content": "Cat personalities are more strongly connected to breed than color. No studies show a strong connection between color and personality. Most of the studies showing any connection are based on the owner’s perception of their cat’s behavior, possibly due to confirmation bias. [3] X Research source Confirmation bias is when someone sees new information as a confirmation of their existing beliefs. [4] X Research source It’s more likely that personality is related to breed. This is probably due to people breeding cats for appearance and a pleasant temperament.

Some are laid-back, aloof, quiet, shy, or intelligent. One study showed that breed behavior differences accounted for most of the perceived differences between cats of different coat colors.

Some believe they are more prone to weight gain, so consider limiting treats and feeding them high-quality cat food at set feeding times (instead of free feeding). To properly take care of your cat , make sure they get plenty of exercise and mental stimulation (a lot of these orange cuties have plenty of energy to play with!). Don’t skip regular check-ups at the vet to keep them healthy and up to date on vaccinations Orange cats tend to develop freckles as they become adults, so watch for any changes to their markings to identify potential skin cancer.

      "content": "Orange tabbies are orange and white with stripes, spots, or patches. The orange color comes from a natural melanin pigment called pheomelanin, which is the pigment that causes red hair in humans. They commonly have freckles on their nose and mouth. Their coats range from a deep auburn shade to pale cream in one of 5 different pattern types: [10] X Research source Classic: The classic orange tabby pattern has orange and white stripes that create a swirl or bullseye near the cat’s midsection. Mackerel: The Mackerel orange tabby is striped like a tiger with the classic “M” on their forehead. Spotted: The spotted orange tabby’s stripes are broken up, so they look like a leopard . Ticked: The ticked pattern appears to be a solid orange, but they have a speckled pattern with tabby markings on their heads. Patched or Harlequin: These cats are mostly white with several large patches of orange tabby striped areas. [11] X Research source"

      "title": "75-80% of orange tabbies are male.",
      "content": "75-80% of orange tabbies are male. The gene for the orange color is carried on the X chromosome. Because male cats only have one X chromosome, they only need to inherit one copy of the gene associated with the orange color to have an orange tabby coat. Female orange tabbies are less common because they have to inherit two copies for the “orange gene” to be dominant. [12] X Research source There’s some evidence that male cats are more affectionate than females. Because more orange cats are male, this may contribute to the idea that they are friendlier than other cats. [13] X Research source When female cats inherit only one “orange gene,” they become tortoiseshells or patched. All orange cats are tabbies, but not all tabbies are orange. This is because of the way the “orange gene” interacts with the tabby (or agouti) gene, causing a faint tabby pattern to show even when the cat has two recessive tabby genes. [14] X Research source There’s evidence that male orange cats tend to be slightly taller and wider than cats with other coat colors, but more study is needed."

Famous orange tabbies like Morris the Cat, Milo, and Garfield may be responsible for some of the public perception about cats with orange coloring. Morris was the notoriously finicky mascot of the 9Lives cat food brand. He first appeared in commercials in 1969 and still appears in advertising for the brand. [16] X Research source British Prime Minister Winston Churchill received an orange tabby named Jock for his 88th birthday. He was so charmed by Jock that he decided an orange cat would always live at Chartwell, his family home. As of October 2020, Jock VII took up residence in the Churchill home. [17] X Research source"
