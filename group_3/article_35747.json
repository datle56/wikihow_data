To avoid this problem in the future, you can use Roblox's \"Try On\" feature; this allows you to try accessories on your character before finalizing the purchase. If your item is defective, you can contact Roblox support on their website. You must provide your username, item name, link to the item, and a detailed explanation of the problem. You can also contact support for unauthorized charges ."
