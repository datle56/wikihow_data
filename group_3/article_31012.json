Click the Blender 3D icon on your desktop, Windows Start menu, Dock, or Applications folder to open Blender. When you open Blender 3D, you will see a title screen with some settings. Simply click off the title screen to close it. If you do not have Blender 3D, you can download and install it from https://www.blender.org/download/ . It is free to download and available for Windows, Mac, and Linux. It is recommended that you use a full keyboard with a number pad and a mouse with a mouse wheel when using Blender 3D. The number pad makes it a lot easier to navigate the 3D environment in Blender."

[2] X Research source Perspective: Perspective view is how objects appear in real life. They appear to get smaller in the distance. Orthoscopic: In orthoscopic view, there is no perspective. Objects appear to be the same size no matter how far away they are. This is useful when modeling as it allows you to view the exact dimensions of an object."
