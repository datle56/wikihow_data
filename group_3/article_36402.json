      "content": "Act as quickly as possible. The longer you wait, the more likely it is that the paint will dry. When the paint dries, it will become considerably more difficult to remove."

      "title": "Use a flat tool to remove the paint.",
      "content": "Use a flat tool to remove the paint. Take something like a palette knife and use it to gently lift excess paint from the leather. Begin by working around the outside of the stain to avoid spreading the paint. Keep the tool level, so that you limit contact with the couch and do not scratch the leather. Leather does not handle moisture well, so you should try to remove as much of the stain as possible without recourse to water. [1] X Research source Alternatively, you could try using a credit card or a razor blade."

      "title": "Wipe with kitchen towel.",
      "content": "Wipe with kitchen towel. Find a towel that is good at absorbing moisture. Pat the remainder of the stain, lifting as much of it as possible. If you can, try using a dry towel to avoid damaging the leather. [2] X Research source If a dry towel does not seem to work, apply a little bit of water and a nonabrasive soap, like hand soap. After cleaning up the stain, use a towel to pat the surface and remove water as quickly as possible."

      "title": "Rub with a wet towel.",
      "content": "Rub with a wet towel. Water based paints are easy to pick up and can typically be cleaned with a simple wet rag. Try to limit how much water you get on the leather, because leather does not respond well to water. [3] X Research source Be sure to wring out the towel so that it is not dripping water all over the leather. Whenever cleaning, you should start from the outside perimeter of the stain and move inward. Do not make quick, wide movements. Gently rub and dab the stain. [4] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Scrape with a credit card.",
      "content": "Scrape with a credit card. If the water does not remove all of the paint, it should loosen it up enough that it will be easy to pick up. Take a credit card and use it to gently lift the paint off the sofa. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Dab with olive oil.",
      "content": "Dab with olive oil. The oil will permeate and loosen the surface of the paint, hopefully making it possible to remove the remainder of the stain. Use a cotton swab or cloth to dab it in. Try to get as little of the oil as possible on the leather. [7] X Research source Alternatively, baby and other cooking oils can be used."

      "title": "Blot.",
      "content": "Blot. Blot with a dry towel to remove the paint after treated with oil. Apply oil repeatedly as necessary, taking care to blot between applications to remove any paint that the olive oil has dislodged. Dab the swab treated with oil on a paper towel to remove paint that accumulates on it between treatments."

      "title": "Perform a spot test.",
      "content": "Perform a spot test. Before applying a more abrasive chemical to the leather, try putting some in an inconspicuous location, like near the bottom of the seat. If the chemical does not seem to damage the leather, you can use the chemical to treat a more noticeable part of the leather."

      "title": "Use rubbing alcohol.",
      "content": "Use rubbing alcohol. If polish remover does not work, place rubbing alcohol on a cotton swab or towel. Remove excess liquid. Then rub the stain until all of the paint is removed.
