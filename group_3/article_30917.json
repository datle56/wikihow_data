      "title": "Stand up straight with your feet shoulder-width apart.",
      "content": "Stand up straight with your feet shoulder-width apart. This is the basic Milly Rock pose. Put your feet shoulder-width apart and roll your shoulders back. You don’t need to move much for this dance. As long as you keep your back straight and stay mobile, you’re golden. [1] X Research source Let your arms hang down close to your hips. After you learn the basic footwork, you can incorporate them into your routine. The Milly Rock doesn’t have a lot of complicated moves to memorize. The most important part is to display confidence. Standing up straight and looking ahead helps a lot."

      "title": "Step back and forth while standing in place.",
      "content": "Step back and forth while standing in place. Start the dance by bringing your right foot in towards your left foot, then moving it back to its original position. Repeat the motion with your left foot. Continue doing this with both feet at a steady rhythm to master the dance’s basic pattern. [2] X Research source Practice the basic step pattern before adding in variations. Move your feet back and forth with consistent timing first. Try doing it to the beat of your favorite dance track."

      "title": "Twist your hips forward as you step to the side.",
      "content": "Twist your hips forward as you step to the side. Return to your starting position with your legs shoulder-width apart. When you step to the side, move your waist in the same direction as well. Shift all of your weight onto the foot, moving to the side. When your foot touches the ground, swing your weight back towards the center and let your foot come back. [3] X Research source Repeat the motion each time you step to the right or left. The hip movement gives you momentum and rhythm, helping the dance look livelier and more fluid."

      "title": "Hold your hands out in front of your chest with your palms up.",
      "content": "Hold your hands out in front of your chest with your palms up. Raise your shoulders up towards your earlobes, bringing your hands up. Hold your hands directly in front of your chest, keeping your elbows bent almost at a 90-degree angle. [4] X Research source Stand straight and tall. If you notice yourself leaning forward, your arms may be too far ahead of you. Avoid keeping your hands too close to your body. If you can’t move your hands freely, bring your arms forward a little. Start by practicing this motion without doing the 2-step. If you feel confident, you can do both at the same time, but it’s easier to practice them separately at first."

      "title": "Rotate your hands in circles in front of your body.",
      "content": "Rotate your hands in circles in front of your body. Bring one hand down towards your body, keeping your palm upright as you do so. Then, bring your hand up and away from you until it reaches its original position. Practice this motion with your other hand as well. Eventually, you’ll be able to churn both hands at a smooth, consistent rate. [5] X Research source Think of your hands as two wheels on a bicycle wheel. They need to move at the same pace to be stable. The difference is that hands need to be in opposite positions at all times. When one is at the top of the circle, the other needs to be at the bottom."

    {
      "title": "Circle your arms as you step to the side.",
      "content": "Circle your arms as you step to the side. Now that you know a basic arm pattern, incorporate it with your footwork. Start by standing in a neutral position, then begin stepping from side to side. Move your hips to keep up your flow. As you step to the side, begin churning your arms in circles and keep this up as long as you can while moving. [6] X Research source Try to keep your arms and legs moving at a steady pace. Your arms may move faster than your legs. This is normal as long as you keep a steady pace. Practice dancing to a steady musical beat and see if you can maintain momentum."

      "title": "Twist your feet instead of stepping.",
      "content": "Twist your feet instead of stepping. If moving your feet back and forth is too difficult, try twisting your feet instead. Begin in a neutral position with your legs shoulder-width apart. Twist one of your legs and hips inward. Raise your heel up as you twist, pivoting on the balls of your foot. Then, twist back and repeat this on your other side. [7] X Research source This is a good beginner’s move if you’re struggling to do the 2-step or lack leg mobility. Do this to learn the dance’s rhythm without expending too much energy. As you get used to this movement, try incorporating arm movements to make your dance more dynamic."

      "title": "Circle your hands in the air for more movement.",
      "content": "Circle your hands in the air for more movement. Position your arms so your elbows are down and your hands are near your ears. Keep your palms facing upwards with the heel of your palms facing towards the center of your body. Circle your hand out, around, and back towards your body, then repeat with your other hand. [8] X Research source Think of it like swatting bees. Keep your wrists loose, moving your arms at the elbows. Move only one arm at a time. Bring your other arm down beside your body when not in use. As you master the motion, try adding some footwork as well. When you step to the side, raise your arm on that side and move it in a circle. A simpler variation of this is a “princess wave.” Move your arms in smaller circles. You can also move in a reverse direction or make multiple circles for each step."

      "title": "Walk or twist your body for a more dynamic dance.",
      "content": "Walk or twist your body for a more dynamic dance. You don’t have to stand in place while doing the Milly Rock. Start the dance as you normally would, moving your arm while bringing your foot towards your body’s center. Instead of stopping, try bringing your foot all the way out in front of your stationary foot. Then, either bring your foot back or keep dancing in that same direction. [9] X Research source Adding these extra movements can be tough if you don’t have the basic moves down first. Learn the Milly Rock with a 2-step and simple arm rotation first until you develop a solid flow."
