Find a gym that you love and start regularly attending to help you start making new friends. [2] X Research source Don't approach people that are brand new to the gym.

      "title": "Make sure you smell and look nice.",
      "content": "Make sure you smell and look nice. Although you are trying to meet new people at the gym, you are also there to workout. You might not smell or look your best after a tough workout and approaching someone new at that moment isn't the best idea. Make sure you look presentable and smell good before trying to meet someone new. [5] X Research source Talking with people before a workout or after a shower are the best times. Wearing old gym clothes and being smelly can both make bad first impressions. Speaking with someone after their workout might make them feel self-conscious about their appearance."

      "title": "Look online for workout partners.",
      "content": "Look online for workout partners. You don't have to approach a stranger in the gym to find a new friend.

You can try looking for friends on your gym's social media profile. There are websites and apps that help you find local workout partners. Try looking for a partner that is near your fitness level.

      "content": "Decide which type of relationship you want. Before you get too far into building a new relationship with someone at the gym, you'll want to decide which type of relationship you want to have. Knowing how well you want to get to know someone and deciding the nature of the relationship can both help you interact appropriately. Make sure you know the type of relationship you want to build before making a new friend at the gym. Ask yourself if you want the relationship to stay at the gym or go outside of it. Decide if you are looking for a work-out partner, friend or a new romance. Always act in a way that is in-line with the type of relationship you want to build."

      "content": "Start a conversation with someone. Although it may be uncomfortable, there are many ways you can start a conversation with someone at the gym. Starting a conversation will be the first step in building a new friendship. Try opening up a conversation by using some of these examples: [6] X Research source Try offering a compliment about something they are wearing. Ask them where they found their workout gear. Try asking about any classes or sports teams you could join. Reader Poll: We asked 2662 wikiHow readers who've talked to their gym crush, and 54% of them agreed that the best way to break the ice is by making small talk about their workout routine. [Take Poll] This can work regardless of the type of relationship youâ€™re looking for!"

      "title": "Ask for help.",
      "content": "Ask for help. Asking for help can be a great way to start building a new friendship at the gym. Most people will be happy to help you out and show you how to do an exercise or operate a piece of workout gear. If they agree to help you and seem friendly, try opening up the conversation a bit to make a connection. [7] X Research source You could try asking how to turn on a treadmill. You might need help understanding how to use a weight machine. You could ask if someone knows the proper form for lifting weights."

      "title": "Team up.",
      "content": "Team up. Asking someone to partner up for a workout can be a great way to start building a new friendship. Although most workouts can be done alone, having a partner can help you get a better workout and make a new friend. Try asking someone you've met at the gym to partner up during a workout to help build up your friendship. Some weight based exercises require a partner to do safely. Running with someone can be a great way to talk and get in a workout. Working out with someone can provide extra motivation to push yourself harder."

      "title": "Don't interrupt someone's workout.",
      "content": "Don't interrupt someone's workout. When you are approaching someone for the first time at the gym, timing is key. You won't want to interrupt their workout or approach someone who isn't interested in socializing. Make sure you won't be interpreting someone's time at the gym when you try to start a conversation. [8] X Research source [9] X Research source Don't talk to someone if they have ear buds in or headphones on. Avoid approaching someone if they are lifting weights, running hard or are otherwise heavily working out. Try to speak with people before or directly after their workouts."

      "title": "Avoid criticizing someone's form.",
      "content": "Avoid criticizing someone's form. Offering to help someone improve their form without them asking won't be a good way to make friends. Although some people may appreciate the advice, others will be annoyed. Always avoid criticizing someone's form or technique unless you are already good friends with them. Even if you are trying to be genuinely helpful, most people won't appreciate being critiqued. Telling someone how to do a workout without being asked will likely prevent you from starting a new friendship or romantic relationship."

      "content": "Don't make compliments about someone's physique. Although many people hit the gym to improve their physique, complimenting it can be a mistake. You might come across in an unfavorable way if you try to compliment how someone looks at the gym. Always keep you compliments neutral when trying to make a new friend at the gym. Genuinely complimenting someone's technique or ability can be a better way to start a conversation. People may be made uncomfortable by compliments that are too forward. Avoid making such remarks if you are trying to build a new friendship or romance. Offering compliments about someone's workout gear or workout plans can be safe."

      "title": "Don't try to show off.",
      "content": "Don't try to show off. Showing off at the gym isn't a great idea when trying to make new friends. Many people aren't interested in your workouts and likely won't even notice them. Other people may notice that you're showing off and actually lose interest in being your friend. Always opt for good conversation over physical demonstrations when trying to make a new friend at the gym. [10] X Research source Some men may try to impress a women or person at the gym by lifting as heavy as they can, grunting, yelling or flexing. Most people won't even notice this behavior and may actually be annoyed by it. People who focus on looking good or showing off at the gym instead of working out, might not be taken very seriously by fellow gym goers."
