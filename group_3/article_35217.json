On top of the clock, you will see a \"12.\" To the right of the \"12,\" you will see a \"1.\" If you follow the numbers, going right or \"clockwise,\" they will move from \"1\" to \"12.\" [1] X Research source The numbers marking each sections are the hours. The sections between numbers are divided into 5-minute segments. Sometimes, there are tiny lines running along the clock dividing these segments."

If the big hand is an a mark between the numbers, count the marks, then add them to the minutes (clock number times 5). For example: [3] X Research source If the big hand is pointing to \"3,\" you'll know that it is 15 minutes past the hour. If the big hand is pointing to \"12,\" it is the top of the hour. Read whatever number the little hand is pointing to. If the big hand is between \"1\" and \"2,\" note what dash it is pointing to. For example, if it is on the 3rd dash after the \"1,\" it is 8 minutes past the hour. (1 x 5 + the number of dashes)."

[9] X Research source 1 to 3 are simply written as \"I, II, III.\" 4 is written as \"IV.\" The \"I\" subtracts 1 from the \"V\" (which symbolizes 5), adding up to 5. 5 is then marked by a \"V\" and the numbers leading up to 10 are marked by adding \"I\" symbols. The number \"VI\" is 6, \"VII\" is 7, and so on. 10 is marked by an \"X.\" Eleven and 12 are marked by adding to the \"X.\" 11 is written as \"XI\" and 12 is written as \"XII.\""

For example, 9 o'clock AM, is written as \"0900.\" Subtract \"1200\" from the time to determine times that do not start with a zero. For example, 1300 subtracted from 1200 is 100.
