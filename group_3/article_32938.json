      "title": "Plant sugar cane before the first killing frost or after winter begins.",
      "content": "Plant sugar cane before the first killing frost or after winter begins. Sugar cane thrives in warm weather, so it’s important not to plant them when the cold weather could harm or kill them. By planting sugar cane before the first frost, the plant will have already begun growing roots and shoots, which will help it survive the stress of the winter. Planting after the onset of winter encourages the sugar cane to stay dormant throughout the season and sprout in the spring. [1] X Research source Sugar cane grows best in USDA zones 9, 10, and 11, though some species can also grow in zones 7 and 8 if protected during the winter. This plant thrives in hot, humid environments. While it may seem counterintuitive to plant sugar cane in winter, planting it too soon, like in early fall, means it will sprout during the cold months, leaving it open to harm. Planting too late, like in the middle of spring, means it likely won’t be ready to harvest until after the next winter begins, which could again damage the plant and leave you with a meager harvest. When planted in winter, the plant will understand it is too cold and therefore won’t sprout until the weather warms up."

      "title": "Select healthy sugar cane plants.",
      "content": "Select healthy sugar cane plants. Sugar cane is easiest to find during the harvest season, in late summer and early fall. Look for long, thick stems, as these are more likely to produce new, healthy plants. The stems have joints, and a new plant will sprout from the node on each one. Keep this in mind and buy as many stems as needed to produce the size crop you want. [2] X Research source Look for sugar cane plants at your local garden center. If you can’t find them there, check roadside stands and farmer’s markets. Asian grocery stores also often stock sugar cane plants. In some cases, it may also be possible to buy sugar cane plants online, but it will be difficult to see how healthy they are this way."

      "title": "Split the sugar cane stems into 6–12 in (15–30 cm) long pieces.",
      "content": "Split the sugar cane stems into 6–12 in (15–30 cm) long pieces. Leave at least 2 nodes per piece, so that each piece is more likely to produce a few sprouts. If the stems have any leaves or flowers, go ahead and remove them. [3] X Research source Unlike many plants, sugar cane cannot be propagated from seed and is instead grown from cuttings of existing plants."

      "title": "Plant the pieces in the ground horizontally.",
      "content": "Plant the pieces in the ground horizontally. In a sunny area, use a spade or hoe to dig 4 in (10 cm) deep furrows, or trenches, spaced 1 foot (30 cm) apart. Lightly moisten the furrows with a hose and make sure the water has drained completely before planting the sugar cane. Lay each piece on its side, then cover them with soil. Shoots should begin to grow in the spring, usually around April or May, and should form tall stalks by summer’s end. [4] X Research source Sugar cane needs full sun to grow, so make sure the area isn’t shaded. Generally, it should receive at least 8 hours of direct sunlight per day."

      "title": "In cool climates, grow your stems in a pot.",
      "content": "In cool climates, grow your stems in a pot. If you’re worried the cold weather might kill your sugar cane before it’s well-established, try growing it in a container so you can overwinter it indoors. Depending on the size of the plant, choose a pot between 8–20 inches (20–51 cm) in diameter that’s about 14 inches (36 cm) deep and has large drainage holes. Fill it with a mixture of potting soil and compost, then plant the stem horizontally or vertically. Water your sugar cane regularly so the soil stays moist. [5] X Research source If you choose to plant the stems vertically, make sure the bottom 2/3 of the stem is covered in soil. If you plant them horizontally, lightly bury them under a few millimeters of soil. Once the sugar cane develops roots and begins to grow, either transfer it to a larger pot with fresh soil or plant it outdoors. Sugar cane grows best in hot, humid weather, preferably with temperatures around 90 degrees F (32 degrees C) and a humidity level of at least 50%. It can’t tolerate temperatures below freezing. Keep this in mind when deciding whether or not to attempt to grow it in your area. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Alternatively, submerge them in water until they’re established.",
      "content": "Alternatively, submerge them in water until they’re established. Some gardeners prefer starting sugar cane plants in water rather than soil. To root your sugar cane in water, simply place the cuttings in a bowl or glass of water. Replace the water every few days to keep it fresh. Roots will typically begin to form after 1-2 weeks. Plant the cuttings in soil after about a month. [7] X Research source"

      "title": "Fertilize the sugar cane with nitrogen.",
      "content": "Fertilize the sugar cane with nitrogen. Since sugar cane is a type of grass, it thrives on nitrogen-rich fertilizers . Fertilize the sugar cane plants with standard grass fertilizer, or go for an organic option, like chicken manure. Fertilizing just once, when the sprouts first emerge, will help the sugar cane grow strong and healthy so you'll have a good harvest in the fall. [8] X Research source"

      "title": "Give your sugar cane plenty of water.",
      "content": "Give your sugar cane plenty of water. Sugar cane can tolerate brief periods of dryness, but a prolonged lack of water will hinder growth and sugar production. To prevent this, water your sugar cane regularly while it’s actively growing. Generally, sugar cane needs to be irrigated with 1–2 inches (2.5–5.1 cm) of water per week when there’s a lack of precipitation. [9] X Research source"

      "title": "Weed the plant bed regularly as the plants grow.",
      "content": "Weed the plant bed regularly as the plants grow. Sugar cane requires little maintenance except for weeding. Weeds could choke the new sprouts before they have the chance to grow. Check on your sugar cane regularly and pull any weeds you see. This is necessary until the canes grow large enough to produce shade and choke harmful weeds on their own. [10] X Research source"

      "title": "Monitor for pests and disease.",
      "content": "Monitor for pests and disease. A number of pests and diseases can impact sugar cane. Pests such as borers and insects are more likely to impact a crop when they experience waterlogged conditions, while diseases can cause fungal growth and rot stocks. Check your sugar cane regularly for pests or rotting, and take preventative measures to discourage pests and diseases whenever possible. [11] X Research source Selecting sugar cane varieties that are resistant to diseases and viruses known to affect crops in your area is one of the best pest management strategies. While sugar cane is bred to resist disease, it’s still possible it can become infected. To prevent the spread of disease, disinfect any gardening tools and harvesting equipment between uses. The application of controlled amounts of appropriate fungicides or pesticides may help prevent the propagation of a pest or disease within your crop. If you do spot a plant that appears to be infected with pests or a disease, remove it immediately. To protect your sugar cane from rabbits and rodents, put up physical barriers, like fences or wire, to prevent them from reaching the plants."

      "title": "Harvest in the fall after 12 months of growth.",
      "content": "Harvest in the fall after 12 months of growth. Sugar cane plants should be left to grow for as long as possible before the first frost of the year, usually about 12 months after they were planted. If they are left in the ground after the first frost, you will likely be unable to use your plants to make sugar syrup. Generally, the plants will begin to yellow and their leaves will start to dry out when it is time to harvest . [12] X Research source If you live in a place with long, cold winters, play it safe and harvest your sugar cane by the end of September. If you live in a place with mild winters, you may be able to let your sugar cane grow until late October.

      "title": "Use a machete to cut the canes close to the ground.",
      "content": "Use a machete to cut the canes close to the ground. Most of the sugar in sugar cane is stored near the base of the plant, so it’s important to cut the stalks as low as possible. Because mature stalks are tall and thick, like bamboo, simple garden shears won’t cut them. Instead, use a sterilized machete or sharp saw to cut through them. [13] X Research source Don’t hack into the ground, as this can damage the roots of the established sugar cane plants. If you leave the roots in the ground, your sugar cane will come up again next year."

      "title": "Strip the leaves from the cut sugar cane.",
      "content": "Strip the leaves from the cut sugar cane. Sugar cane leaves can be quite sharp, so be sure to wear gardening gloves before removing them. Then, use the discarded leaves to cover up the planting bed. The leaves will act as an organic mulch that will protect the sugar cane roots over the winter. If you don’t have enough leaves to cover the whole bed, use some straw to finish the job. [14] X Research source"

      "content": "Does sugar cane need to be burned prior to harvest? No, sugar cane doesn’t need to be burned for a home garden, and it isn’t recommended. This process is used only in large commercial fields to remove leaves and plant stems while leaving the lower parts of the stalks for harvest. Burning can be a health hazard because of the smoke and should be left to the professionals. [15] X Research source"

      "content": "Do I need to prune sugar cane plants? It isn’t usually necessary to prune sugar cane, but sometimes, if the plant is growing vigorously, the grass may begin to sprawl and fail to remain upright. In this case, it’s best to cut the plant back and remove dead or withered foliage for a neater appearance. [18] X Research source"
