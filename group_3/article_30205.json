      "content": "Resist the urge to contact him for a few weeks. When it comes to getting him to miss you, “You definitely have to give an Aquarius man space,” explains Eyedealism. Blowing up his phone with \"I miss you\" texts might make him feel smothered. Instead, give him some time on his own. He'll wonder what you're doing and will likely come to miss you on his own terms. If you've gotta talk to him, keep things brief and only reach out occasionally. [1] X Research source Use this time away to reflect on your relationship. Think about your actions (and your ex's) and how you might want to change in the future. As you learn about yourself and grow, your Aquarius ex will likely start to wonder what you're up to without him, which could push him to reach out. [2] X Research source If you're really missing him and get the urge to call him, try calling a friend instead. That way you can get your emotions out without relying on your ex. Be honest with yourself about whether getting your Aquarius man to miss you is a good idea. It's tough to accept, but if your relationship ended on bad terms or it wasn't so healthy, it might be best to move forward."

      "content": "Aquarians long for partners that are happy on their own. These air signs are all about individualism and bettering oneself, so take the breakup as an opportunity to glow up and prove how independent you really are. Throw yourself into your interests, whether that be sculpting, playing music, or spending time outdoors, and post updates about your new endeavors on social media. If an Aquarius man sees that you have your own passions and that you’re fine without him, he may be more intrigued and drawn to you. If you and your Aquarius man do end up getting back together, Garbis recommends maintaining this focus on your individual interests, so that he knows you’ve got your own things going. “It would be good to have your own passions, hobbies and pursuits to keep you from being so focused on the relationship,\" says Garbis. \"Maintain a life of your own to prove that you are a high quality, self-sufficient and confident person, and that you don’t need your Aquarius to always pick up the pieces or dictate how you live your life.\""

      "title": "He's more likely to miss you if he notices your thriving social life.",
      "content": "He's more likely to miss you if he notices your thriving social life. Forward-thinking Aquarians love trying new things , and they’re drawn to partners who can match this energy. [3] X Research source To show him you’re this kind of person, pack your schedule with adventures, and post occasional updates on social media to let everyone (including your ex) know what you're up to. The more you show off your spontaneous, fun-loving lifestyle, the more your Aquarius man will take notice, and hopefully start to miss you. After a breakup, it's tempting to pine and tell your ex how sad you are without them. This will likely turn-off an independent Aquarius man. Showing him that you're more than fine without him is what will pull at his heartstrings. Fun things you can do with your friends and family include hiking, going out to eat, and taking day trips to new places."

      "title": "Becoming his friend in a low-key way can help you get closer again.",
      "content": "Becoming his friend in a low-key way can help you get closer again. “An Aquarius man needs a lover who can also be a friend. They need to be casual about commitment, and not fussy over pushing the relationship,” says Garbis. If you rush him into talking about getting back together, he may get spooked and back off, but if you gradually reintroduce yourself into his life as a friend , he may start to miss your relationship and be open to reconciling. When you run into him, smile, ask how he's doing, and keep things light and upbeat. You might say something like, \"Hey, good to see you! I hope you've been doing well.\" If the conversation flows, suggest a casual catch-up session. For example, you could say, “It was so great to run into you. If you’re down to grab coffee sometime, I’d love to catch up more.” Avoid asking about his personal life, like if he's dating anyone new. That might make him uncomfortable."

      "title": "Seeming bitter or lashing out will really turn off an Aquarius.",
      "content": "Seeming bitter or lashing out will really turn off an Aquarius. As an air sign, Aquarius is most comfortable in the realm of the mind, and super strong emotions can scare them off, explains Eyedealism. To keep the peace, resist the urge to send him angry texts, and hold off on any long talks about your past relationship. It's also best to avoid dating someone else just to make him jealous. This kind of drama will send an Aquarius running in the opposite direction, as they often struggle with emotionally-charged conversations. By taking the high road and remaining respectful, you'll encourage him to see you in a positive light again. If you find yourself getting worked up about your breakup, call a friend to vent instead."

      "content": "This is a great way to catch his eye again. “When an Aquarian reaches a decision, it’s hard to get them to change their mind […] but you may be able to win them back physically,” says Garbis. Wear outfits that make you feel super confident and keep up with your personal hygiene. You might even try changing up your appearance with a new hairstyle or fragrance for a fresh post-breakup look. He'll be struck by your glowing appearance, and this may get him thinking about you again. [4] X Research source “[Aquarians] like things to be cutting edge, so do things a trendsetter would do,” suggests Garbis. “Wear a hint of something wild with your outfit, like a bright scarf or brooch.” “A new haircut or perhaps Cosplay will get this sign to pay attention,” Garbis adds. However, keep in mind that you don't have to reinvent yourself or change your looks drastically after a breakup. Just wear things that make you feel good about yourself and your confidence will shine through!"

      "title": "If things ended badly, he might need an apology before he can miss you.",
      "content": "If things ended badly, he might need an apology before he can miss you. Everyone makes mistakes in relationships, so if something you did contributed to the breakup, try giving him a heartfelt apology . Aquarians are naturally peacemakers, so if you’re truly sorry, chances are he'll forgive you and want to make his own amends, too. [5] X Research source Apologize to him in person, over text, or even with a handwritten letter. In your apology, include direct references to your mistake, a genuine show of remorse, and a promise to change your behavior going forward. Maybe you didn't respect your ex's passions in life. You might say, \"I'm really sorry I didn't pay enough attention to your art. You're such a talented musician and I never went to your performances. I really regret that now.\" If he doesn't respond or isn't ready to forgive you, respect that and give him space. He still may come to miss you in time, especially now that he knows that you're sorry."

      "title": "The key is to remind him of your relationship without being obvious.",
      "content": "The key is to remind him of your relationship without being obvious. According to Eyedealism, Aquarians can struggle with emotional intimacy, so it’s a good idea to broach a topic like reconciliation carefully. As you reconnect, you could try texting him a song that was meaningful to your relationship, or a screencap from your favorite movie to watch together. This is a great way to remind him of the good times and hint that you miss him, without getting too emotional. If you text him a song you both liked listening to when you were together, you might add, \"Heard this on the radio the other day and thought of you.\" Perhaps you and your ex enjoyed reading or looking at art together. You could also send him an excerpt from a book you both loved, or a picture of a painting with sentimental value. Caption it with something simple like, \"Remember this?\""

      "title": "Like all air signs, Aquarians are attracted to the mind most of all.",
      "content": "Like all air signs, Aquarians are attracted to the mind most of all. So, if you want this Aquarius man to miss you, “you must engage mentally first,” says Eyedealism. When you hang out, try having thought-provoking discussions about topics like philosophy, religion, art, and politics. Ask him questions about his point of view, and take an active interest in what he has to say. He'll likely return the favor and start really missing the intellectual bond the two of you shared as a couple. [6] X Research source If you're catching up at a coffee shop, point out the art on the walls and ask him what he thinks of it. Message him a link to an interesting news story with the caption, \"Just read this piece. I'd love to hear your thoughts on it!\" Avoid super emotionally charged topics. An Aquarius man probably won't want to have a fiery debate about what went wrong in your relationship right now—he’d rather stay in the realm of the intellectual and theoretical for a bit."

      "content": "Aquarians are known for being humanitarians. Also known as The Water Bearer, this sign is deeply committed to social justice, and they want to be a force for good in the world. [7] X Research source If you’re also passionate about this, try spending some time volunteering for causes you care about. You could attend a beach clean-up, volunteer at an animal shelter, or organize a clothing drive, for example. This could show him you’re on the same page about this important part of his personality, which could make him miss your presence in his life."

      "content": "An Aquarius doesn't like to fall into a routine. As you start to rebuild your friendship (or even something more), make exciting plans that the two of you have never tried before. Avoid falling into old habits, like going to the same restaurants you went to when you were together. Instead, try new places, shops, and parts of town to explore. Aquarians are all about growth, expansion, and planning for the future, so he'll be super into this new, spontaneous version of you. [8] X Research source Rather than staying in to watch movies like you would have in the past, check out a local drive-in movie theater, or set up a projector screen for a movie under the stars in your backyard. Anything to keep the vibe new and exciting! Make a promise to only go to restaurants and coffee shops you've never been to before when you meet up."

      "content": "Don't put too much stock in how your Aquarius ex feels about you. This might leave you feeling hurt, and it could also make your ex feel pressured to feel a certain way (and no Aquarius wants to feel emotionally pressured or smothered). [9] X Research source Take good care of yourself and remember that you can thrive with or without your Aquarius ex. This is good for you, but ironically, it’s probably also good for your chances of getting back together! Practice self-care by eating healthy meals, exercising, and getting plenty of sleep. If you find yourself struggling with your self-esteem after a breakup, that's totally normal. Try boosting yourself back up again by remembering your strengths. Anytime you feel down, remind yourself of your talents and accomplishments. If you realize that your Aquarius ex doesn't miss you, it's okay to feel sad. Just remember that there are other people out there that will love you. Think of your time with this Aquarius man as a learning experience and put yourself out there again when you're ready.
