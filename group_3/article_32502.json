      "content": "Boil a pot of water on the stovetop. Choose a pot large enough to hold all your plums and fill it half full with water. It'll probably take about 10 minutes to boil. [1] X Research source Place a lid on the pot to help the water to boil quicker."

      "title": "Fill a large bowl with ice and water.",
      "content": "Fill a large bowl with ice and water. Add water and ice to the bowl in a 50:50 ratio. This will act as an ice bath for the plums. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Slice an \"x\" on the bottom of each plum.",
      "content": "Slice an \"x\" on the bottom of each plum. Use a paring knife to cut a cross hatch at the bottom of the plum (the side opposite the stem). Make each cut about 1 inch (2.5 cm) long. This will make it easy to peel back the skin. [3] X Research source Don’t worry about making the cut deep. Lightly cut through the skin of the plum and not too much into the flesh."

      "title": "Blanch the plums for 45 seconds in boiling water.",
      "content": "Blanch the plums for 45 seconds in boiling water. Carefully place the plums into the pot of water. It is important not to leave the plums in the water for longer than 45 seconds because the flesh will go mushy and the plums will start to disintegrate. [4] X Research source Always be careful when cooking with hot water to avoid burns."

      "title": "Submerge the plums in the ice water for 5 minutes.",
      "content": "Submerge the plums in the ice water for 5 minutes. Use a slotted spoon to transfer the plums from the boiling water into the ice bath. The icy water will help to pull the skin away from the flesh of the plums. Make sure that all the plums are fully submerged in the water. [5] X Research source If some of the plums aren’t submerged in the ice bath, make another ice bath for them."

    {
      "title": "Peel the skin off the plums.",
      "content": "Peel the skin off the plums. Place your finger under 1 of the little flaps formed by the \"x\" you sliced, and pull back the flap. The skin should easily come loose in 1 big strip. Keep pulling back the flaps on all four sides until you've completely peeled the plum. [6] X Research source If there is still a little skin on the plum, use a paring knife to slice off any remaining skin."

      "title": "Cut around the circumference of the plum.",
      "content": "Cut around the circumference of the plum. Press the paring knife firmly into the flesh until it hits the stone and cut right around the plum. Keeping cutting until you have split the plum in half. [7] X Research source If you don’t have a paring knife, use a sharp kitchen knife instead."

      "title": "Twist each half of the plum in opposite directions to pull it away from the stone.",
      "content": "Twist each half of the plum in opposite directions to pull it away from the stone. Hold 1 half of the plum in each hand. Firmly grip the halves and slowly turn them away from each other until one half of the plum comes loose from the stone. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Chop both pieces of plum in half. Cut each plum half lengthways to create a wedge. This makes the plum easier to peel. [11] X Research source If your plum is particularly large, consider chopping each piece of plum into thirds."

      "content": "Trim the skin off each plum wedge. Press the skin side of the plum firmly down against the chopping board. Carefully glide the knife as close to the skin as possible to remove the skin from the flesh. [12] X Research source Compost the plum skin or use it in smoothies."
