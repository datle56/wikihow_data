      "content": "Choose a moisturizer appropriate for your skin type. You can get moisturizer oil-free, extra heavy, or anywhere in between. Oil-free or light moisturizers are best for people with oily, combination, or normal skin. Heavier moisturizers are often necessary for dry skin, but they can be a slippery base for makeup. [1] X Research source Heavy moisturizers add a dewy effect to your appearance. Avoid using dewy foundation on top of that, which can overdo it. You don't need to use the same moisturizer across your whole face. If you get dry patches in certain areas, use a heavy moisturizer on those spots."

      "content": "Consider a separate under-eye primer. The thin skin around your eyes tends to dry out easily. If your eye makeup often cracks, look for a moisturizing under-eye primer as well. Although some facial primers are safe for the eye area (check the label), an under-eye primer is less likely to irritate this sensitive area."

If you still encounter problems, here's a little troubleshooting advice: If your makeup has trouble staying in place, you may not be using enough moisturizer (or you may need to use a primer). If your makeup ends up mixing into the moisturizer when you apply it, decrease the amount of moisturizer or wait longer between moisturizer and makeup."
