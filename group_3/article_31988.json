Begin by clenching your fists for 7-10 seconds. Release your fist for 15 to 20 seconds while you focus on how the tension is leaving the muscles in your hands. Repeat the exercise with other muscle groups, moving up your arms, to your head, then down the back of your body to your feet and toes. [3] X Research source Bourne, E.J. (2010).

I know where I am headed and when I have to make lane changes and turn-offs. I am well prepared. Even though I am a passenger, I can control my reactions to riding in the car. If I feel uncomfortable at any time, I can ask the driver to pull over."

      "content": "Consider confronting your phobia. You've probably been told that you need to face your fear. Exposing yourself to the fear is especially important if you've been avoiding driving for fear that you'll have a panic attack.

This way, you'll have some sense of control during the session. Avoiding your phobia will actually make the fear worse over time and can create other phobias.

Then, go through and rank these fears from what you fear the least to what causes a full panic attack. This will help you gradually expose yourself to your fears.

For example, holding the keys in your driveway might be something you fear the least while driving on the highway can cause you to have a panic attack."

Instead of driving, you may want to gradually face your fear by riding in a car with a driver you trust. Choose someone you know will drive with the greatest of care. Once you're comfortable riding with that person, try to ride with other drivers or ride along on more challenging drives (like on the highway). Find what feels the most comfortable for you when you begin riding as a passenger. You might find that you prefer to sit in the backseat. Or, maybe you find it less stressful to sit next to the driver. Experiment to find what works for you."
