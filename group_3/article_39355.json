    {
      "title": "Freeze the cake for 2 days before shipping.",
      "content": "Freeze the cake for 2 days before shipping. This will keep the cake fresh as it travels and will prevent the icing from smudging during transport. Place the cake in the freezer so it's level and avoid placing things on top of it as it freezes. [1] X Research source When making the cake, avoid using ingredients that may spoil during transport, like cream cheese frosting, custard, or fruits, just in case the cake begins to thaw."

      "title": "Wrap the cake in plastic wrap to create an airtight seal.",
      "content": "Wrap the cake in plastic wrap to create an airtight seal. Begin wrapping the frozen cake in plastic wrap, going around all the edges a couple of times. Wrap the plastic wrap in all different directions to ensure it’s completely covered. This creates a tight seal so no air can get in, keeping it as fresh as possible. [2] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Set the cake in an insulated bag or box with ice packs to keep it cold.",
      "content": "Set the cake in an insulated bag or box with ice packs to keep it cold. Place the wrapped cake in an insulated bag that keeps food cold. Set a few ice packs in the bag around the cake to keep it frozen as well. Once the cake is in the bag, use tape to seal it off so the cold air doesn’t escape. [3] X Research source If you order frozen foods to be delivered, these often come in insulated bags with ice packs that you can use for the cake, or they can be purchased at a grocery store or big box store. As an alternative to ice packs, consider using dry ice. Wear gloves if you’re handling dry ice, as it will burn your skin. Use a container that's tight and fits the cake nicely so it's doesn't move around too much during shipping."

      "title": "Place the cake in a new sturdy cardboard box to ship it.",
      "content": "Place the cake in a new sturdy cardboard box to ship it. Set the insulated bag with the cake in it in a brand new box the right size for the cake. There doesn’t need to be lots of free space around the cake, but the box shouldn’t be squishing any part of it. Choose a cardboard box that’s sturdy and corrugated to ensure a safe delivery. USPS has free 2-day shipping boxes that come in varying sizes that you can use to ship your cake in. While the box itself is free, you'll pay a flat rate for shipping."

    {
      "title": "Fill in any extra space with bubble wrap or paper.",
      "content": "Fill in any extra space with bubble wrap or paper. Once the cake is placed in the box, fill in the box so there isn’t any space for the cake to move around. Use bubble wrap, newspaper, tissue paper, or even plastic bags to fill in the empty spaces, creating a snug cushioning for the cake. [4] X Research source Place the padding on all sides of the cake to protect it."

    {
      "title": "Use packing tape to seal off the edges of the bag and box.",
      "content": "Use packing tape to seal off the edges of the bag and box. After using packing tape to seal off the insulation bag, tape up the box as well. Place the tape on each open edge of the box, creating a fully sealed cooler so no cold air is able to escape. [5] X Research source Tape the top, bottom, and each edge of the box using packing tape. Use multiple layers of the tape to create a secure seal."

    {
      "title": "Attach the address and shipping labels to the box.",
      "content": "Attach the address and shipping labels to the box. Either hand-write the address on the box to bring to the post office to pay for a shipping label, or do your shipping label online to make the process easier. If you’re printing out your shipping label with the address on it, tape the label on using packing tape. Make sure the address and shipping barcode are clearly visible on the box."

      "title": "Write “Fragile” on the box so postal workers know to handle it carefully.",
      "content": "Write “Fragile” on the box so postal workers know to handle it carefully. Once your box is all taped up and labeled, use a permanent marker to write “Fragile” on the top and sides of the box. You might also label which side is up so that postal workers know to handle the box carefully as well as which side to set it down on. [6] X Research source If you have a sticker that says “Fragile,” this would work as well."

      "title": "Choose 1-2 day shipping to ensure your cake gets to its destination quickly.",
      "content": "Choose 1-2 day shipping to ensure your cake gets to its destination quickly. Since you’re shipping food, it’s important that the cake spends as little time traveling as possible. Choose a shipping option that only takes 1-2 days so that your cake doesn’t fully thaw by the time it arrives at its destination. [7] X Research source If you choose a flat-rate box from USPS, your cake will arrive in 2 business days. Fast shipping options often include overnight shipping, next-day shipping, or two-day shipping."

      "title": "Send out the cake early in the week to avoid weekend delays.",
      "content": "Send out the cake early in the week to avoid weekend delays. Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday are the best days to ship out your cake to ensure it arrives quickly. If you ship it out on a Thursday or Friday, it’s likely that your cake will get stuck over the weekend when things aren’t being mailed. [8] X Research source If you ship it out on a Wednesday, get to the post office early in the morning to make sure it’s sent out that day."

      "title": "Track the cake as it’s being delivered to keep an eye on its progress.",
      "content": "Track the cake as it’s being delivered to keep an eye on its progress. Most mail or shipping services will give you a tracking number for your package. Type this number into the service’s online tracking system to check exactly where your cake is and when it gets delivered. Consider giving the tracking number to whomever you’re shipping the cake to so they can track it as well."
