Then firmly take hold of the cord between your first fingers and thumb. Pull the cord along, running your fingers down it as you go and pulling through the tangles along the way."

      "content": "Reposition the phone on your desk for use on your dominant side. For example, if your left side is the side you use when answering the phone, put the phone on the left side of your desk. The tangles occur when the handset of the phone is pulled or twisted around into position that are the opposite direction of the twists already in the chord. While this can happen from either side, it is most common when you pick the phone up with one hand, switch to the other, and then hang up with the hand that began farthest from the phone."
