Verrucas are caused by a virus found in moist, warm environments. It enters your skin through any small cuts or openings in your foot, and thus the verruca is born. By protecting your feet in warm, wet, communal environments you can be sure to avoid most verrucas. Keep in mind that the virus can lay dormant. This means that while you may not have any symptoms and HPV may not show up on tests, you may still technically have the virus."

You will feel a sharp, pinch-like pain for 3 seconds or so, but after that the pain should fade. After 10-15 minutes you will likely feel nothing but light numbness. If you have a low pain tolerance, sit down to perform the procedure. While fainting is uncommon, you want to make sure you don't hit anything if you feel woozy."

Apply a piece of duct tape tightly over the verruca and left there for six days.When the six days come to an end, remove the tape and soak the verruca for 5 minutes in warm water. Duct tape supposedly works by containing the virus near the skin, aggravating it while causing your immune system to focus on the wart and destroy it.

All verrucas will clear up by themselves within a year or two, so if the verruca is not causing you any pain, you should consider letting it run its course. This is the easiest, best way to get rid of your warts, as your immune system does all the work. However, verrucas will rarely clear up on their own in people with weakened immune systems (such as people with HIV), so it is recommended that they seek treatment. Avoid high-heeled shoes, or anything that puts a lot of your weight onto the verruca, to ease the pain. Thicker socks and comfortable shoes will all help.
