      "content": "Rizz refers to a person’s ability to attract someone or flirt . Rizz is short for charisma. Generally, you’d say someone “has rizz” if they’re able to make it happen romantically with someone, or many people, super easily. They’re great at hitting on people, seducing people, and just generally, they come off as attractive and suave. [1] X Research source Lizarraga says, \"Someone with rizz is great at hitting on people, they have a seductive charm, or maybe perhaps they’re super attractive and blessed with good looks. The key to having rizz is not trying too hard!\" Lizarraga also notes, \"Rizz can also be used as a verb. For example, 'I have a huge crush on that girl, I’m going to build up the courage and go rizz her up.'\" Usually, someone talks with “rizz,” but a person can also have “ unspoken rizz ,” or a silent charm. Usually, silent rizz is about body language, confidence, or looks. Sometimes, rizz can be about two people’s chemistry instead of an individual's ability to spit game. So if two people flirt constantly and have great banter, someone might say: \"Woah, those two have rizz.\""

Something about their approach was attractive enough to win over another person—whether it was a pick-up line, a compliment, or just confident, direct question: “So, can I have your number?” [2] X Research source Other examples of “rizz” would be if someone successfully hooked up with their crush or asked someone on a date."

      "content": "Someone who everyone has a crush on. If someone is the object of everyone’s affection, then they probably have rizz. There’s a magnetic aura about them that draws peoples in, whether it’s their sense of style, self concept, or stunning looks, they don’t need to do too much to capture your attention. In this case, rizz isn't something you can observe, it's self-evident. Because they attract so many people, they must have rizz. Usually, this is an example of unspoken rizz . Maybe they're not a smooth talker and they're not super flirty. But still, they seem irresistible to others, so then their rizz is mysterious, subtle, and unspoken. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Someone who talks with charm and flirts confidently. Sometimes, rizz isn't about results. It's more about how a person presents themselves and interacts with others. Have you ever seen those people who are just natural flirts? They seduce effortlessly and make those in their presence feel they have their full attention. These people may possess the “gift of the gab,” and it doesn’t take much for you to be under their spell. That's some serious rizz. “Hey girl, are you from Tennessee? Because you’re the only ten I see.” “There are a lot of hot guys in here, but I can’t take my eyes off of you.” “What do I have to do to get a date with you? You tell me, and I’ll make it happen.\""

It could be that they flirt all the time, or they have amazing banter, or it’s something that you can’t quite put your fingers on. But one thing’s for sure: there’s some sort of romantic connection there. “Dante and Beth have insane rizz. I don’t understand why they don’t just date already.” “I know that Morgan and Leslie act like they hate each other, but I feel like secretly, they have rizz.” “Question: do you think that Marisol and I have rizz? I can’t tell…”"

Whether it was a quick wink or a great pickup line, don’t let their rizz go unnoticed! Throw them a compliment to let them know you admire their charm: “Woah, I see you! That was some serious rizz you just showed there.” “Did you seriously just get that guy’s number? I’m in awe! Nice rizz, girl.” You can also use the word rizz to make fun of a failed flirting attempt, but just remember to keep it kind: \"Uh oh, that was not your best work. You have no rizz!\""
