Pick out 10-15 hairs along your forehead in various spots, and pull 20-25 hairs from along the center part. Since many wigs are made by a machine, this section can end up looking too “perfect,” leaving you with fake-looking hair.

This will hold the wig in place so it doesn’t shift or fall off while you’re wearing it. Opt for shorter pieces rather than long ones, since longer strips can sometimes peel at the ends.

This will keep the wig looking natural and prevent your forehead from looking too small or large.
