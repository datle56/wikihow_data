      "title": "Purchase a replacement awning fabric.",
      "content": "Purchase a replacement awning fabric. Start by measuring your awning from the inside of each cap. Afterward, head to a home hardware store and purchase an appropriately sized replacement fabric. [1] X Research source Use high-quality, heavyweight, tight-weave vinyl for the best results. Check the manufacturer's instructions for fabric recommendations."

      "title": "Remove the main bolts that hold the top of the awning to the side of the RV.",
      "content": "Remove the main bolts that hold the top of the awning to the side of the RV. There should be 2 on each side of the awning—4 in total. Use a cordless drill and bolt extractor tip that matches the size of your awning's bolts to remove each one. [2] X Research source If your awning legs extend to the ground, don't worry about the awning falling off—the combination of spring tension in the roller tube and the legs attached to the base of the RV will hold it up. For awnings that fold into the side of the RV, keep a firm grip on the bracket at the left end of the roller tube to prevent the spring from unwinding."

      "content": "Remove the 2 small screws that prevent the fabric from sliding in the track. There should be 1 on each end of the awning—2 in total. Each screw is attached to the RV by the long, horizontal metal plate that holds the track and can be removed with an electric drill. [3] X Research source Use a screwdriver instead of an electric drill if you'd like."

      "title": "Pop the awning arms out of their brackets and extend them to the ground.",
      "content": "Pop the awning arms out of their brackets and extend them to the ground. Each bracket is located on the side of the RV at the lower end of the awning arms. Pull them outward away from the RV to pop them out. Afterward, extend them until they're both touching ground. [4] X Research source Pull the bottom of the awning arms down to the ground to extend them. On some RV models, you can arms upward against the RV instead of to the ground."

    {
      "title": "Roll the awning out 1 foot (0.30 m) from the RV.",
      "content": "Roll the awning out 1 foot (0.30 m) from the RV. Start by flipping the control lever on the right side of the roller tube as though you're preparing to fully extend the awning. Now, use the awning rod to pull the roller tube out about 1 foot (0.30 m) from the RV. [5] X Research source Check that both arms are resting on the ground so that the fabric is unrolled about 1 foot (0.30 m) from the awning."

      "title": "Cover the upper awning brackets with electrical tape or masking tape.",
      "content": "Cover the upper awning brackets with electrical tape or masking tape. This will make sure they don't scratch the side of the RV. If your awning is really old, use a sharp edge to cut away the sealant that connects the fabric to the track. Be sure to apply tape before sliding the awning off the RV. Scrape any debris from the inside of the track with a sharp edge."

Now, apply downward pressure to the screwdriver to lever the pieces apart. This will ease the removal of the fabric. [6] X Research source Spread the end of the track to about 2 to 3 inches (5.1 to 7.6 cm) for the best results."

Now, begin pulling the tube off the track to the front or rear of the RV. Afterward, walk the awning completely out until it's free. Before walking the awning out, make sure you have plenty of room in front of or behind the RV. If the fabric is stuck in the track and difficult to slide, ask a third person on a ladder to continue pulling until it slides easier. If you don't have any helpers, elevate the awning legs with bricks. Set the awning tube down carefully when you're done."

Keep a firm grip on the vice grips and lift them slightly to release pressure from the awning control lever. Now, flip the lever to the \"Rolled Up\" position and carefully unroll the awning. [8] X Research source Be sure to count the exact number of rotations required to fully unwind the awning as you need to roll it up later. Remove the vice grips when you're done."
