      "title": "Five-card combinations",
      "content": "Five-card combinations There are five different combinations for a five-card hand, each with a different rank. Royal Flush is the highest rank, followed by Straight Flush, Four-of-a-kind, Full House, and Flush with a Straight. [8] X Research source Royal Flush: A royal flush consists of the highest-ranking cards in consecutive order. For example, a play containing an Ace, King, Queen, Jack, and Ten in that order is considered a royal flush. [9] X Research source Straight Flush: A straight flush is any five consecutive cards with the same suit. For example, if you get 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 all diamonds, that’s a straight flush. [10] X Research source Four-of-a-kind: A four-of-a-kind (also known as quads) consists of four equal-ranking cards and any extra card to complete the hand. They are ranked based on the number of the cards. For example, four kings beat four jacks. [11] X Research source Full House: A full house is made up of three cards with equal rank and a pair of cards with equal rank. They are ranked based on the rank of the three cards. For example, three aces with two kings beats three kings with two aces. [12] X Research source Flush: A flush has five cards with the same suit, but not a consecutive rank. They have a two-part ranking system. The first rank is based on the suit and the second is based on the number. For example, a diamond flush with a queen beats a diamond flush that has 8 as its highest card. [13] X Research source Straight: Straights are made up of consecutive ranked cards that aren’t the same suit. Their rank is based on their highest card. For example, a King-high straight (K, Q, J, 10, 9) would beat a 10-high straight (10, 9, 8, 7, 6). [14] X Research source"

Instead, wait until someone plays a high card close to yours, then play your card. This can trip up your opponents and cause them to use their best card prematurely. If your card is a 2, ace, or king with a high suit, play it against a card of the same number with a lower suit."

When cards start getting shed and everyone’s hands start to dwindle, opponents can get caught in the moment. Gain the upper hand by saving your pairs for those moments.

In pusoy dos, you work to get rid of your cards quicker than everyone else. In poker, you can play with more than four players, unlike pusoy dos, where you can only play with two to four players. [16] X Research source Pusoy dos and poker use a similar ranking system, both equipped with royal flushes, straights, and other card combinations. Unlike poker, you can’t use two pairs in pusoy dos. A two pair consists of two sets of cards that both have equal value and an extra card. For example, two queens, two 8s, and a 3 is a two pair."
