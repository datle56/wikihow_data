When files are muxed, they contain interleaved audio and video tracks, which are mixed together instead of being stored as separate tracks. Here's how to figure it out. Open the original movie file in QuickTime Player. From the Window menu, chose Show Movie Info . Click the More Info disclosure triangle in the Movie Info window (if it's closed). Note the entry next to \"Format.\" If the format is \"MPEG1 Muxed\" or \"MPEG2 Muxed,\" the audio portion of your video file is incompatible with your iPod and iTunes applications, and with anything else based on QuickTime. There is not fix for this other than to use a third party application to convert all of the file."
