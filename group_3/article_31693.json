      "title": "Tap around the lid of the jar with a wooden kitchen spoon to break the seal.",
      "content": "Tap around the lid of the jar with a wooden kitchen spoon to break the seal. Grab a wooden kitchen spoon; the heavier the better. Tap the lid of the jar on top a couple of times around the edge to pop the seal, then try to twist off the lid. [1] X Research source You might need to repeat this a few times to get the lid to loosen. You can try other kitchen utensils if you don't have a kitchen spoon. Wood utensils work best, but anything heavy could work."

      "content": "Use a butter knife or the edge of a metal spoon as a lever for another option. Insert the flat tip of a butter knife or the tip of another flat metal utensil that fits under the edge of the lid’s rim. Carefully pry the lid away from the jar, working your way around the rim, to break the seal. [2] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Slap the base of jar with the palm of your hand for a hands-only method.",
      "content": "Slap the base of jar with the palm of your hand for a hands-only method. Hold the jar at a 45-degree downward angle with your non-dominant hand. Firmly slap the bottom of the jar with the center of the palm of your dominant hand and listen for a pop to tell you you have broken the seal. [3] X Research source This method is called the “water hammer”. It functions by raising the pressure against the lid to pop the seal."
    },
    {
      "title": "Submerge the lid in hot water for 30 seconds to break the seal.",
      "content": "Submerge the lid in hot water for 30 seconds to break the seal. Fill a dish with hot (but not boiling) water and flip the jar upside down in it. Leave the jar for 30 seconds, then try to open it. Repeat this process if the lid doesn’t come off the first time."
    },
    {
      "title": "Use a hair dryer to heat up the lid if hot water doesn’t work.",
      "content": "Use a hair dryer to heat up the lid if hot water doesn’t work. Turn the hair dryer on high and aim it at the lid for 30 seconds to expand the lid and loosen the seal. Use a towel or other heat barrier to try to twist off the lid. [4] X Research source This method also helps to melt jam or other sticky foods that may have glued the lid shut in the first place. Be very careful with this method not to burn yourself. The metal lid will get very hot."
    },
    {
      "title": "Try using a lighter as another way to heat up the lid and pop the seal.",
      "content": "Try using a lighter as another way to heat up the lid and pop the seal. Move the flame of a lighter slowly and carefully around the rim of the jar's lid to heat it up. Use a towel or gloves to try to twist off the lid once you have heated it up. The hotter you get the lid, the more it will expand, but be very careful because both the lighter and the lid of the jar will get very hot!"

    {
      "title": "Try twisting off the lid with a dry dish towel.",
      "content": "Try twisting off the lid with a dry dish towel. Sometimes a towel is all you need to give you the extra grip to twist off a stubborn lid. Hold the jar in your non-dominant hand and place the towel over the lid, then twist it counterclockwise. [5] X Research source It’s a good idea to try opening difficult jars over the sink or a counter. This way, it will be easy to clean up anything that spills out if the lid suddenly comes off quickly."

    {
      "title": "Put on a pair of rubber kitchen gloves to give your hands more traction.",
      "content": "Put on a pair of rubber kitchen gloves to give your hands more traction. Put on a dry pair of kitchen gloves that you would normally use to wash dishes or clean. Try to twist off the lid of the jar as normal. [6] X Research source You can use a single glove if you feel like you have better grip on the body of the jar with your naked hand."

    {
      "title": "Place plastic wrap over the lid to get a better grip.",
      "content": "Place plastic wrap over the lid to get a better grip. Tear off enough plastic wrap from a roll to cover the lid of the jar. Place it over the top and press it down around the rim until it clings to the lid, then twist the lid off. [7] X Research source Note that the more clingy the plastic wrap, the more likely this method is to work."

    {
      "title": "Stretch a rubber band around the lid to add grip as an alternative to plastic wrap.",
      "content": "Stretch a rubber band around the lid to add grip as an alternative to plastic wrap. Get a rubber band that can fit tightly around the lid of the jar and stretch it around the rim. Use your dominant hand to grip the rubber band and try to twist the lid off. [8] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Try using a dryer sheet for extra grip if you have one handy.",
      "content": "Try using a dryer sheet for extra grip if you have one handy. A dryer sheet is another option to create traction for your hands. Place a dryer sheet over the lid and twist the lid off. [9] X Research source You could try combining this method with the rubber band method by placing a rubber band over the dryer sheet to hold it more securely in place."
