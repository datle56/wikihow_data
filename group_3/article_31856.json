      "content": "Make sure the bags are clean and dry before storing them. Throw away any plastic bags that are covered in food particles, as these will become unsanitary and might lead to unpleasant odors. Bags should be dry and free from food waste before being taken to a recycling facility. Anything made out of plastic film, like bread bags, dry cleaning wraps, bags that newspapers come in, and cereal box liners, can usually be recycled alongside plastic grocery bags. [1] X Research source If you aren’t sure what your local recycling facilities will accept, call them and ask what’s okay to recycle."

      "content": "Store bags in another plastic bag for convenience. Compress bags into a ball and store them in another bag, then tie off the storage bag at the top.

      "title": "Consider using a plastic or metal basket.",
      "content": "Consider using a plastic or metal basket. If you have an extra basket that can hang on the side of a cabinet, you can store many bags in it before it becomes full. You can also use an old container of cleaning wipes or a plastic filing box as a container.

You can also hang baskets using a wall slat system. [4] X Expert Source Robert Rybarski Organizational Specialist Expert Interview. 31 January 2020.

      "content": "Keep your container tucked away, but easily accessible. You might prefer to keep the container out of sight if you prefer not to have the plastic bags in plain view. It’s common to store your plastic bags in a cabinet, in the laundry area, or on the floor of the pantry."

      "title": "Tie the bags into knots.",
      "content": "Tie the bags into knots. Tying the bags into knots is a great way to reduce the amount of space they take up. An easy way to make a knot is to fold them lengthwise and make a simple overhand knot. Once they’re knotted, you can store them in your container of choice until you’re ready to use them. Whenever you need one, just take out a knotted bag and untie the knot."

      "content": "Fold the bags into triangles for a crafty alternative. Plastic bags can be folded into compact triangles that make them more visually appealing and easy to store. It takes a bit more effort than balling them up or tying them into knots, but turning them into triangles can add some fun to the task. Think of it as a craft instead of a chore."

      "content": "Roll the bags into a cylinder if you want to keep them all together.

      "title": "Regularly recycle and reuse your bags.",
      "content": "Regularly recycle and reuse your bags. There are several ways to recycle your newly-organized plastic bags. Most curbside recycling programs don’t accept plastic grocery bags, but you can usually drop them off at a grocery store or a similar retail location like Walmart or Target. Get creative! You can reuse the bags as trash liners, wrapping for delicate items, pillowcase stuffing, and much more. If you notice that your containers start accumulating a lot of bags, it might be time to make a recycling trip."
