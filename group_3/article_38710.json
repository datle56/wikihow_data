      "content": "Test the waters. Even if you've been dating a girl or guy for months, it may turn out that this isn't the type of communication that she or he is comfortable with. For that reason, it's important to test the waters before you get into raunchy or explicit messaging and completely throw the person off. Start with a simple greeting like, \"hey, baby\" or \"hey, sexy,\" and see how the person responds. [1] X Research source If you're not too explicit at first, you can also just play it off and deny that you were even trying to send a sexy text if the person gets angry or accuses you of trying to start something. Just start with a sexual undertone. If you just say, \"What's up?\" or \"How are you?\" it'll be more difficult to transition to a sexy mindset. It's better to set the tone right away so the person knows what to expect. You can also say, \"I'm a little bored. I could use some excitement in my life.\" Try this: \"I saw a girl who looked just like you in this movie I was watching. She was really hot -- but you're even hotter.\""

      "title": "Wait for the person to respond in a sexy way.",
      "content": "Wait for the person to respond in a sexy way. Once the person on the other end responds to the opening text in a favorable manner, it's time to play ball. If you see that the person is also up for dirty or sexy texting and is game, you can start to increase the sexual content of your texts -- but only by a little bit. Have patience as the person gets back to you. If it takes too long, you may not be in the mood anymore, and you can have fun another day. [2] X Research source Don't keep sending dirty texts if you get no response. If the person comes back to his or her phone to a slew of dirty text messages, that will just look weird. If the person isn't into it, don't try to pursue it. Just apologize quickly and move on with your day -- there's no need to make a big production of it."

      "title": "Up the ante.",
      "content": "Up the ante. Continue to send dirty texts but make them more explicit. You can even start to suggest that you can come over to put your dirty words into action. If the girl you're texting says she's studying sex ed, you can ask if you can come over for a \"hands on\" tutorial. Here are some other things you can say to up the ante: \"Hang on, let me put on some clothes.\" \"It's so hot in here. I'm going to take my shirt off.\" \"What are you wearing on this balmy night?\" \"What if I showed you what I meant?\" \"Can you guess the color of my underwear?\""

      "title": "If the person responds favorably, raise the stakes even higher.",
      "content": "If the person responds favorably, raise the stakes even higher. If you see that the person you're texting loves the dirty texts and maybe even wants to connect in person, then you can make the conversation even more explicit. You can talk about actually seeing the person you're texting, or about touching yourself or taking off your clothes. Here are some things you can say: \"I took off all my clothes. I'm just lying under a blanket now.\" \"I'd text you, but I'd rather close my eyes and imagine you were here.\" \"What would you do if you were next to me?\" \"It's freezing in here. Why don't you come keep me warm?\" \"Sorry it's taking a while to text you back. My hands are a little busy.\""

      "title": "Get creative.",
      "content": "Get creative. If both you and the other person are really into the dirty texting, then you can keep going until you start touching yourselves or plan to meet up. Whatever happens, bring some imagination and creativity into your texting so the person on the other end doesn't get bored. Be as detailed and descriptive as you can, and respond quickly so the other person knows she has all of your attention. Here are a few more things you could say: [3] X Research source \"If you were here, I'd start stroking your hair. But then I'd start stroking something else...\" \"I'm so excited I can barely text.\" \"I'm wearing this tight shirt. Do you want me to take it off for you?\" \"I'm taking off your belt -- I'm thinking about whipping you with it...\" \"I just got out of the shower, so my hair is soaking wet. Do you have a towel?\""

      "content": "Have fun with mutual masturbation . If the dirty texting is going in the right direction, then you and your texting partner may slowly be removing your clothes and starting to touch yourselves. If both people are into it, then this can be a fun and stimulating activity. Just tell each other what you're doing to each other, what you're doing to yourselves, and what you would do if you were together. [4] X Research source All you have to do is let loose and talk dirty until you've both orgasmed. You can say, \"I want you to [verb] my [body part].\" This can make the sexy experience feel more real. Tell the person how your body feels during the exchange -- describe every little sensation, even what you're feeling in your toes."

    {
      "title": "See the person you're texting.",
      "content": "See the person you're texting. Mutual masturbation is fun, but so is hooking up in person. If the conversation is going in that direction, then you can ask the person if she wants you to come over, or invite her over to your place. If it's clear that this is what the dirty texting is building towards, then you can suggest that the person should come over, and then be more explicit if you have to. Here are some things you can say: \"I'm trying to picture how hot you look, but I'd rather just see you in person.\" \"Why don't you come climb into bed next to me? I want to see if it's as good as I'm imagining it to be.\" \"I guessed the color of your underwear. But how will I know if I was right?\" \"Why don't we continue this in person? I want to use my hands for something other than texting.\" \"Why don't I drop in on you? I'll be in the neighborhood anyway -- if you want me to be.\""

    {
      "title": "End the exchange.",
      "content": "End the exchange. Whether you're ending the exchange because you're coming over to see the person, or because you both got what you wanted, you should be suave when you end things. You can also just end the exchange because you've both had some fun with dirty texting and it's time to go. Whatever the reason, you should be smooth and should continue to set a sexy tone even at the end. Don't just say, \"Bye!\" or \"See ya!\" when you're done texting. Say, \"I can't wait to text you again soon.\" Or, \"I'll get in touch with you on another hot, lonely night.\" Make the person want to hear more from you. Don't switch to a non-sexy topic at the end of the conversation. Don't say, \"By the way, are you going to Kelley's birthday party tomorrow?\" Save that question for another time. If you're ending the conversation because you're going to see the person, just say, \"I can't wait to continue this in person\" and make your way over to her place to take your dirty texting to a physical level."
