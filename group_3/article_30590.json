      "title": "Remove any hairstyles that might affect the measurements.",
      "content": "Remove any hairstyles that might affect the measurements. When you’re measuring the circumference of a head, certain hairstyles can add bulk and throw off the measurements. If the person whose head you’re measuring is wearing braids, a bun, or a ponytail, remove them before the measurements."

      "title": "Take out any hair adornments that might interfere with measurements.",
      "content": "Take out any hair adornments that might interfere with measurements. Even if your hair isn’t in a style that adds bulk to your head, the way you’re wearing it can affect your measurements. Remove any clips, barrettes, or other accessories that might alter the measurements."

    {
      "title": "Use a flexible, non-stretchable measuring tape.",
      "content": "Use a flexible, non-stretchable measuring tape. If the tape can stretch, you won’t get an accurate measurement for the head circumference. Instead, choose a flexible plastic tape with no stretch. A style that allows you to insert one end into the other is ideal if you’re measuring an infant’s head. [1] X Research source You can try using a metal measuring tape, but the metal typically doesn't curve around the head as easily as a plastic style."

      "title": "Measure with a string alternatively.",
      "content": "Measure with a string alternatively. If you don’t have a flexible, non-stretchable measuring tape, you can use a non-stretchy piece of string. Wrap it around the head as suggested and mark it to indicate the circumference. Next, lay the string out on a flat surface and use a ruler to measure it. The measurements won’t be as accurate, but it can still give you a good idea of the head circumference. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Place the measuring tape just above the eyebrows and ears.",
      "content": "Place the measuring tape just above the eyebrows and ears. It’s important to measure the child’s circumference at the widest part of the head. Set the tape right above the ears so it's nearly touching them and line it up on forehead so it sits over the brows. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Pull the tape around the back where the head slopes up from the neck.",
      "content": "Pull the tape around the back where the head slopes up from the neck. With the measuring tape in place above the ears and brows, wrap it around the back of the head. Be careful not to pull it too tight. [4] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Lay the tape where the head slopes up from the neck.",
      "content": "Lay the tape where the head slopes up from the neck. Make sure the tape lays flat against the back of head where the slope is most pronounced. Overlap the tape slightly to get the most accurate measurement, and note the number. [5] X Research source Measuring a baby’s head circumference can be important to ensure that their brain is growing and developing as it should. You can find appropriate growth charts for boys and girls on the Center for Disease Control's website at https://www.cdc.gov/growthcharts/who_charts.htm#The%20WHO%20Growth%20Charts . If you’re concerned about the measurement, consult your child’s doctor."

      "content": "Repeat the process to ensure that the measurement is accurate. To ensure that your measurement is correct, it’s a good idea to check your results a second time. Measure the head a second time -- and even a third -- to verify the measurement. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Place the measuring tape 1-inch (2.5-cm) above the tops of your ears. When measuring an adult head, the tape should be above the ears just as it would be for a baby. However, instead of placing it right above the ears, set the tape so it’s about an a little bit above the top of the ears. [7] X Research source"

      "title": "Sit the tape about 3-inches (7.5-cm) above the brows.",
      "content": "Sit the tape about 3-inches (7.5-cm) above the brows. To get an accurate measurement, it's important that the tape rest above the brows in addition to the eyes. Make sure that it lies flat against the forehead. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Wrap the tape around the back to rest in the middle of the occipital bone. Pull the tape around the back of the head, making sure to keep it in place across the forehead. You should place the tape so it sits in the middle of the bone, which is the small bump that you can feel at the back of the head.

You won't be able to read the tape at the back of your head, so use your fingers to mark the spot where the end of the tape sits against the rest of the tape. Carefully lift the tape off your head and note the measurement."
