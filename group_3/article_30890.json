      "content": "An MICR number is a financial code used by banks. MICR stands for Magnetic Character Recognition. Your full MICR code is the line of numbers printed at the bottom of your checks. This number is printed in magnetic ink, and special machines read this ink to process checks and move money through the banking system. [1] X Research source Note that MICR codes and what they look like vary by country, financial institution, and even document. Your MICR account number is the number of your account contained within the code. See the section below for further details."

      "content": "Yes, an MICR is different from an account or routing number. More specifically, an MICR code is a string of digits that contains both a routing number, which identifies the financial institution or bank, and an account number, which is your personal financial account’s identifier. MICRs also often contain a third code used to identify the financial document itself, like a check number, which identifies the individual check. [2] X Research source Account numbers are simply used to identify individual accounts (not customers, since customers may have more than one account) at a financial institution. In the U.S., they’re often 12 digits long, but may vary by bank. In the U.S., routing numbers are 9 digits long, and the first 2 digits are coded to specify the Federal Reserve District, or location, of the institution. On the other hand, MICR numbers—the complete string of routing number, account number, and any other codes—are used to track and process financial documents and transactions."

      "content": "Examine the bottom of a check for your MICR account number. On most checks, the MICR number is the long string of digits along the bottom, and is usually divided into 3 groups. First the routing number, then the account number, then a check number. Note that the middle number is most often the account number. [3] X Research source Some institutions may swap the position of the account number and check number. In the U.S., the routing number is always 9 digits, and whichever of the other 2 numbers is longer is the account number."
