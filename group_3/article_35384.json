      "content": "Pay attention to uncomfortable skin sensations. Before the characteristic shingles blisters develop, you may feel pain, tingling, or itching in the area that is affected. The area may even become numb or be sensitive to touch. [3] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source This can occur any time between 1 and 5 days before the rash shows up. [4] X Trustworthy Source Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Main public health institute for the US, run by the Dept. of Health and Human Services Go to source If you feel any discomfort in a stripe-like pattern on your body for over a day, see your doctor and ask about shingles – especially if you have recently been in contact with anyone with a rash. Tell your doctor something like, “I have been feeling a burning sensation over my left ribs since yesterday, do you think I might have shingles?” They will ask you other questions and possibly prescribe an antiviral medicine to reduce the severity of symptoms."

      "title": "Note where your symptoms are located.",
      "content": "Note where your symptoms are located. Shingles generally develop on one side of your face or body. This is related to the way the virus affects your nerves and the parts of the body that those nerves are connected to. Common places to develop signs and symptoms of shingles are in single stripes over your ribs, on your neck or shoulders, and on one side of your face. [5] X Trustworthy Source Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Main public health institute for the US, run by the Dept. of Health and Human Services Go to source The most commonly affected area is in a stripe wrapping around one side of your torso. [6] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source If you have another condition that weakens your immune system (such as HIV, an autoimmune disorder, certain chronic infections, or cancer), the virus may be more widespread and affect both sides of your body."

      "title": "Look for redness.",
      "content": "Look for redness. After the initial feeling of pain, itching, tingling, numbness, or sensitivity, look for a red rash to develop on that area of your skin. This usually occurs a few days after the initial discomfort. [8] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Some people get the feeling of burning or pain and never develop the shingles rash."

      "title": "Identify blisters.",
      "content": "Identify blisters. The shingles rash forms blisters (or vesicles), which are small painful swellings in the skin filled with fluid. Shingles blisters generally appear in a group in a single area on the body. Do not touch or scratch your blisters – the fluid in the blisters contains the virus, and you can spread infection to other areas of your body. Keep your blisters covered and wash your hands often to minimize the risk of spreading the virus."

      "title": "Watch the blisters for scabbing.",
      "content": "Watch the blisters for scabbing. Shingles blisters usually crust over and form scabs 7-10 days after they appear. These should clear up in about 2-4 weeks, and the scabs should fall off. Do not pull these off yourself, let it occur naturally.

      "content": "Realize that anyone who has had chickenpox can get shingles. There’s a common myth that if you’ve had chickenpox once, you can never get it again. Unfortunately, because VZV stays in your body the rest of your life, this simply isn’t true – though once you’ve had chickenpox, the virus usually returns as shingles. Even children can develop shingles if they’re exposed to the virus. Most people only get shingles once, but it is possible to develop an outbreak of shingles multiple times throughout your life."

      "title": "Recall whether you’ve been exposed to VZV.",
      "content": "Recall whether you’ve been exposed to VZV. The Shingles virus is not sexually transmitted or spread through sneezing or coughing. Rather, it is transmitted by touching the shingles blisters or fluid from the blisters. [10] X Trustworthy Source Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Main public health institute for the US, run by the Dept. of Health and Human Services Go to source If you have been around someone in the blister-phase of the infection, you should wash your hands thoroughly; avoid touching anyone else’s rash. A person is not contagious before the blisters appear or once the blisters have crusted over completely. Keeping the blisters covered lowers the risk of transmitting the virus. If you have never had chickenpox and come in contact with someone with shingles, you can get VZV – but you’ll get chickenpox, not shingles. (However, you can then get shingles later in life.)

You are also at higher risk of getting shingles if you have a weakened immune system. This may be due to: Cancer treatment with chemotherapy or radiation Lymphoma or leukemia Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or AIDS (Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome) Taking immunosuppressive medications like steroids or drugs given after an organ transplant"
