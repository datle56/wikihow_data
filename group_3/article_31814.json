Here are some examples: [3] X Research source For example, if you wanted to display results in alphabetical order based on a column called NAME, you'd use ORDER BY NAME; . Ascending order is the default sort order, but you could also specify that you want it ascending using ORDER BY NAME ASC; if you'd like. [4] X Research source If you'd rather show the results in the opposite order, you'd use ORDER BY NAME DESC; . DESC means \"descending order.\" [5] X Research source If you want to sort based on two columns, separate them by commas. For example, ORDER BY LAST_NAME ASC, FIRST_NAME DESC; would display results sorted alphabetically by last name. If the same LAST_NAME matches multiple FIRST_NAME entries, the results of FIRST_NAME will also display in descending order."
