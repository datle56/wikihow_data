      "title": "Soak a cloth in hydrogen peroxide and place it over the stain.",
      "content": "Soak a cloth in hydrogen peroxide and place it over the stain. Find an old rag or cloth you don’t mind staining and dip it in a bowl of 3% hydrogen peroxide. Lay your scorched item flat on your work surface, with the burn mark facing up. Cover the scorch with the damp rag. [1] X Research source Only use this method on clothes that will not be discolored by hydrogen peroxide. If you’re not sure, test the peroxide on an inconspicuous area to see if it bleaches the fabric. For extra stain-removing power, feel free to add a few drops of ammonia directly to the scorch mark. Hydrogen peroxide and ammonia are safe to use together, but avoid ingesting the mixture, and wash your hands when you’re done."

      "title": "Iron the cloth on medium-high heat.",
      "content": "Iron the cloth on medium-high heat. Let your iron heat up to a fairly hot (but not extremely high) temperature, then begin gently ironing the hydrogen peroxide-soaked cloth. This may sound counter-intuitive since an iron is likely what caused the scorch mark in the first place, but the heat will gradually help the hydrogen peroxide work into the scorch mark and remove it. [2] X Research source If you prefer, place another clean, dry cloth on top of the peroxide-soaked rag before ironing, but this isn’t always necessary. Using an extra cloth can help prevent your iron from getting wet, which can lead to rusting if it doesn’t dry properly."

      "title": "Repeat until the burn mark is removed.",
      "content": "Repeat until the burn mark is removed. Check on the scorch mark frequently as you iron the cloth. For mild to moderate scorch marks, you should notice a steady, gradual improvement. Rewet the cloth with hydrogen peroxide as it dries out, and keep ironing until the stain is gone. This usually takes some time, so be patient. [3] X Research source If this method doesn’t work, feel free to try another one. However, it is possible the stain could be permanent."

      "title": "Soak fresh scorch marks in cold water for 24 hours.",
      "content": "Soak fresh scorch marks in cold water for 24 hours. If you make a fresh scorch mark while ironing, immediately turn the iron off and submerge the scorched garment in cold water for 24 hours. Check on the garment the next day, and if the stain is gone, launder it according to its care label. If the iron mark isn’t gone, try another method, like applying a hydrogen peroxide-soaked cloth to the stain and ironing it. Always treat scorch marks as soon as possible, as they’re easier to remove when they’re fresh. Don’t wait until you’re finished ironing to treat a scorched piece of clothing or fabric. If you don’t want to wait 24 hours, some sources say soaking a scorched item in ice water for at least an hour can remove burn marks."

      "title": "Pretreat light stains with laundry detergent.",
      "content": "Pretreat light stains with laundry detergent. Rinse the scorched item in warm water to wash away any loose singed matter. Then, use your fingers to rub laundry detergent into the burn mark. Let the detergent set in for several minutes, then wash the garment according to its care label. Hang the garment outside to dry in the sunlight. [4] X Research source Liquid detergent works best because it can seep between the tightly-woven fibers of the fabric to treat the mark on a microscopic level. If you have powdered detergent, mix it with a little water first to form a loose paste. The sun’s rays are known to lighten all types of stains in fabric, including scorch marks. However, don’t leave your item in the sun for more than a day or so, as sunlight can gradually weaken and discolor fabric."

      "title": "Soak tough stains in a bleach solution for 15 minutes.",
      "content": "Soak tough stains in a bleach solution for 15 minutes. If the scorched fabric is bleach-safe, pretreating with bleach is a great way to remove tough iron marks. Mix a bleach-water solution consisting of a capful or two of bleach for every gallon of water. Submerge the scorched item for 15 minutes, then launder as usual and hang it in the sun to dry. [5] X Research source Check the item’s care label to make sure it’s bleach-safe. As a general rule, wool, silk, mohair, and non-colorfast fabrics are not suitable for cleaning with bleach. Another option is to dampen an old cloth with a 50:50 bleach-water solution and place the cloth on the scorch mark. Place a clean, white cloth on top of that cloth, then iron the cloths on medium heat to transfer the scorch mark. Then, wash the garment as usual."

      "title": "Rinse the garment with white vinegar for a natural solution.",
      "content": "Rinse the garment with white vinegar for a natural solution. Soak a sponge or rag in white vinegar and rub it on the scorch mark, or apply the vinegar directly to the stain. Let the vinegar soak in for about 10-15 minutes, then rinse the garment with cool water. Repeat this process until the stain is gone or you no longer see improvement, then wash and dry the garment as normal. [6] X Research source Only use white vinegar. Never use red wine vinegar, apple cider vinegar, or other types, as these can cause new stains which can be difficult to remove. Similarly, try squeezing fresh lemon juice over the scorch mark. Then, drop the item into a container of hot water and let it sit for about 15-30 minutes before washing and drying as normal. Just be aware that lemon juice can bleach some fabrics."

      "content": "Scrub scorch marks with an emery pad as a last resort. Heavy scorch marks may not be removable with normal cleaning methods. In some cases, though, you may be able to lessen the visible damage by scraping the burnt material away with a gentle abrasive, like an emery pad . This is not guaranteed to work, however, and if you rub too harshly, you may wear a new hole in the fabric. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Scorch marks can sometimes be permanent. Unfortunately, scorch marks that are particularly dark and/or deep may not be removable, even with repeated treatment. Light marks can usually be treated, but deep ones usually leave at least some permanent discoloration. [8] X Research source In these cases, consider covering the mark by cutting it out and patching it, or simply discard the item. Alternatively, try recycling your fabric for another purpose."

      "content": "Check your garment’s care label before ironing to prevent scorching. Before you iron a piece of clothing or fabric, check its care label to make sure it can be ironed and what temperature to use. Iron clothes when they’re slightly damp, and use a press cloth between the garment and the iron to prevent scorch marks. [9] X Research source Don’t leave the iron sitting in the same position for too long; keep it moving. Iron delicate fabrics inside out to protect them."

      "content": "Sand carpet to remove minor scorch marks. To get burn marks out of carpet , first vacuum the scorched area using a long nozzle to generate high suction. Use coarse sandpaper to lightly sand the edges of the burn mark, then vacuum again. [10] X Research source Follow up by blotting the area with a commercial household cleaner, then blot the area clean with a damp sponge. Allow the carpet to dry completely. If the scorch marks are severe, you’ll likely have to hire a professional carpet cleaner to remove them."

      "content": "Remove scorch marks from wood with steel wool. Sometimes, light scorch marks can be removed from wooden surfaces by rubbing the area with superfine (#0000) steel wool . When you’ve rubbed off as much as possible, soak a cotton swab in chlorine laundry bleach and place it on any remaining discoloration to remove it. Then, sponge the area with clean water and wipe it dry. [11] X Research source This works for both wooden floors and wooden furniture. To restore the wood’s natural oils, rub in some linseed oil or clear mineral oil, then wipe off the excess after a few minutes. If necessary, apply a wood stain to restore the wood’s finish."

      "content": "Make a baking soda paste to remove scorch marks from pots and pans. If your cookware has become scorched, cleaning expert Alessandra Mendes says, “Make a paste by mixing equal parts baking soda and water. Rub the paste over the stains and scrub with a brush. You may have to scrub stubborn stains for a while.” Depending on the type of cookware, you may need to play around with the ratio of baking soda to water to find what works best. Alternatively, make a paste with baking soda and vinegar."
