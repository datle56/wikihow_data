      "content": "Ask your doctor about wearing a post-op compression garment. A compression garment is elastic shapewear that you wear over your incision site post-surgery. After surgeries such as liposuction, they are necessary to keep your bandages in place and control swelling and bleeding. Ask your doctor if you should wear a compression garment after your operation, and for how long you should wear it. [7] X Research source Doctors will typically recommend that you wear a post-surgery compression garment for 3-6 weeks. Compression garments are available online or in medical supply stores. Shapewear garments should be stretch and carefully pulled over the abdominal area and removed gently while your abdomen is still healing."
