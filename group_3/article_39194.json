      "content": "Start with your feet shoulder width apart. Face a mirror so you can watch as you practice. This is very similar to the method for how girls shake their hips, but for guys it will be less exaggerated and the move will be slightly different. [7] X Research source This stance will provide stability as you perform the dance move. Standing in this position will help you use your core muscles to perform the dance move. You want to avoid using your back and leg muscles to swing your hips. The move will not look right and you could end up straining you muscles if not done properly."

This will prevent your moves from being wide and exaggerated. Rotate your pelvis forward, then to the right. Rotate it towards the back, then to the left again. While you do this, keep your movements subtle and keep your pelvis tucked under. When a guy does a hip shaking move in dance, it is typically a smaller more understated move than when a girl performs this type of dancing. If you are doing this move correctly, your upper torso should stay still and in place. Your hips will not swing out dramatically to the side, but rather rotate in a small circle with your pelvis tucked under."

Then, rotate your hips backwards and to the left. Repeat the same thing on the other side, and return to your original position. Make sure your hips are moving independently. Your upper torso and chest should stay in place. If your hips are swing too far to the side, you probably aren't tucking your pelvis forward and under as you move. Think about how dancers like Usher and Michael Jackson move their hips. These are smaller, less emphasized motions than female dancers use, but are still full of energy!"

Incorporate hip shaking along with pop and lock movements for street dancing. Hip-hop dancing often also uses booty shaking along with hip shaking. Move quickly and use music with a fast, strong beat. Think about how energetic dancers like Beyoncé and other performers are when they move their hips."

[11] X Research source In Latin dancing hip shaking is incorporated with rhythmic dance steps in dances like the tango and merengue. [12] X Expert Source Leela Fazzuoli & Daniele Cavallo Professional Latin Dance Instructors Expert Interview. 7 October 2021. Dancers move their hips out when they step forward in back in rhythm with music. As you perform a Latin style dance, you will be alternating steps with your right and left feet. As you step with your right foot, rotate that hip outwards slightly. Do the same when you step with your left foot. Latin dancing incorporates more natural looking and subtle hip movements than hip hop and street dancing. With Latin dancing, you won't be exaggerating this movement, but allowing your hips to move loosely in a natural pattern. Shakira is a very famous Latin artist famous for hip shaking. Her dancing is slightly more similar to contemporary hip-hop than traditional Latin dancing."
