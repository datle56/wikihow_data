      "title": "Call ahead or order in person.",
      "content": "Call ahead or order in person. If you place your order over the phone, make sure to order about 30 minutes in advance. The employee will also give you an estimate of when your pizza will be done. Head to the Costco warehouse at the estimated time. If you order in person, go to the food court desk and tell them what kind of pizza you’d like. [1] X Research source Unfortunately, Costco currently doesn’t have the option to order online, and you can’t have your pizza delivered from their food court. In Costco’s locator tool , find your local Costco, and click on it. Under “Warehouse Services,” you can click “Food Court” to see the phone number to place your pizza order ahead of time. You need a membership to order pizza from the Costco food court. You can purchase a membership online or in person."

      "title": "Pay for your pizza.",
      "content": "Pay for your pizza. If you called ahead, pay for your pizza when you get to the Costco warehouse. You can go to the check stands, the self-checkout, or the food court’s self-service checkout. When paying, tell the employee what kind and how many pizzas you’d like to purchase. The employee will enter your order information, and then you can pay. To order in person, pay at the food court counter after you order. [2] X Research source If you’re paying in cash, go to one of the check stands. If you’re paying with a debit or credit card, you can pay at the check stands, the self-checkout , or the food court self-checkout. Some Costcos have a food court self-serve kiosk, which may be the easiest and fastest way to pay if you’re only ordering pizza."

      "content": "Pick up your pizza. If you called ahead, pick up your pizza at the food court desk. If you ordered in person, stand near the food court and wait for an employee to call out your order number when your pizza is ready. If you’re ordering a lot of pizza, or if you need your pizza to be ready by a certain time, calling ahead is recommended so you don’t have to wait for a long time. Here’s an extra pick-up hack: you can order your pizza at the counter, do your grocery shopping, load your car, then come back in and pick up your pizza so it doesn’t get cold."

      "content": "It takes about 15-30 minutes to get your pizza. It may take longer if the food court is really busy or if they have other call-in orders to fulfill. [3] X Research source Since you can’t predict how many other orders the food court will have at a given time, it may be best to call ahead and order 30 minutes to an hour before you have to pick it up."

You can also get a ½ cheese and ½ pepperoni pizza for the same price. [4] X Research source Costco used to sell combination pizzas with vegetables and sausage. However, this option and the ability to “customize” your pizza with veggies and sausage was discontinued in 2020."
