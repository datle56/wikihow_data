      "title": "Open the book and study the blank two pages.",
      "content": "Open the book and study the blank two pages. Think about what subject might lend itself to a long, narrow format. The possibilities are endless; plan to utilize the entire expanse of paper. A landscape study. A country scene. The buildings of a city, row on row. A walking figure and what is seen in passing."

      "title": "Use a pencil to start.",
      "content": "Use a pencil to start. An eraser will be handy if you are unsure or unhappy with the first attempt on the pages. The eraser on your yellow pencil's end is perfect if you haven't pressed too hard and etched your lines on the paper. Erasers often come in multi-packs. A pink eraser can be a handy accessory; stash the other colored ones in the pack to use in the future."

Aim to fill the entire expanse of the two pages. Reach to the paper's top and bottom edges. Letters: Random or spelling words. Lines: Straight, wavy, curly, zig-zag, etc."

Vary colors, keeping the pressure on the marker on the page consistent. Be inventive with the markers. Use both the corner of the tip for fine lines and the whole tip for wider lines."

      "content": "Outline some parts of the design in solid black marker. Or, pick a color and outline in that. Or, vary colors. Color whole sections or images with the markers. Play. Have fun. Be inventive. You will find the more you work, the more confidence you will build. Where you hesitated earlier, you will begin bolding drawing your lines."
