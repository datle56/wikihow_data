Factor that number by writing it as the product of two smaller numbers. (If the factors aren't obvious, just see if it divides evenly by 2. If not, try again with 3, then 4, and so on, until you find a factor that works.) Example: Simplify 45 {\\displaystyle {\\sqrt {45}}} . The first step is finding some factors of 45. You can't divide 45 by 2, so try dividing it by 3 instead: 45 ÷ 3 = 15 {\\displaystyle 45\\div 3=15} , so 45 = 3 × 15 {\\displaystyle 45=3\\times 15} . 45 = 3 × 15 {\\displaystyle {\\sqrt {45}}={\\sqrt {3\\times 15}}}"
