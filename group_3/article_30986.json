      "content": "Buy pure, natural henna. You will need about 50-100g for short hair, 100g for medium hair, and 200g for long hair. Don’t worry about being precise; it’s a pretty forgiving process. When buying natural henna , there are a few things to keep in mind. Some henna comes already mixed with additives. If you have purchased a henna that describes a particular color, you may not want to experiment with adding to the mix unless you are an experienced henna user. The additions described here are intended to be added to pure henna powder. Henna out of the box should be green to brown, and smell like dried plants or grass clippings. Do not buy any henna that is purple or black, or that has a chemical smell. If you have severe allergies or sensitive skin, do a patch test before using. Apply a small bit of the henna mixture to your skin, wait a couple hours, and watch to see how your skin reacts. You can shop for henna powder online or at ethnic stores.

      "content": "Keep in mind that you might get varied results. This is not a precise science. There are a huge number of variables, and you may not get exactly what you wanted the first time around. Results will vary, and your hair may dye unevenly. If you are a perfectionist about your hair, this process is probably not for you. Pure henna can only achieve shades of red. If a product called \"henna\" purports to dye your hair black, it contains indigo. Some henna mixes can give you a blonde color, but it will always be a reddish blonde. Rather than obscuring your natural hair color, henna blends with it. This is important to remember when mixing a color. Aim for a color you want to combine with your natural one, not the color you want to achieve. Keep in mind that very light colored hair will probably need to be dyed multiple times to become dark. Because grey hair is translucent, it creates a cleaner canvas for henna. This means the mixing effect that happens with non-grey hair will not take place, and your color will be much closer to the color created by the dye. It also means it is easier to dye your hair unevenly, as hair with more dye on it will become noticeably darker. [3] X Research source"

The list is longer than can be contained in one article, but here are a few to consider. [4] X Research source [5] X Research source Bright strawberry blonde: Use lemon juice, vinegar, or red wine. Intense red: Use brandy. Less intense, browner red: Use coffee or black tea. If you dislike the smell of henna, you can add good smelling things like essential oils, rosewater, or cloves. You do not need to add anything to change the color of pure henna. Water will work fine as well. [6] X Expert Source Moushami Iyer Henna Artist Expert Interview. 12 July 2021. However, you should add a dash of lemon, orange, or grapefruit juice to oxidize the dye. If this is your first time using henna, you may want to see how it combines with your hair on its own, so that in the future you can decide what, if anything, you want to add."

There is no way to tell precisely what amount of liquid you will need. Add it a little bit at a time, stirring until the mixture is the gloopy consistency of yogurt.

It may be a good idea to wear gloves, and you should immediately wipe the mixture off of anything you accidentally smear it on."

Pay special attention to the ends and the roots, particularly along your hairline. Err on the side of using too much. When your hair is evenly coated, pile it on top of your head, and wrap your hair securely in a towel. Wipe off any excess henna with a wet washcloth. [13] X Research source"

If you don’t want to sleep with the dye in your hair, you can simply leave it in for a few hours. The longer you leave it in, however, the more intense the effect will be. The greater change you want to effect, the longer you will need to leave the dye in. It is easier to darken light hair than it is to lighten dark hair. If you have very dark hair to begin with, even leaving henna in overnight won’t make you a strawberry blond."
