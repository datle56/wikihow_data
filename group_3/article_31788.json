      "content": "Locate the SIM tray. It's a rectangular panel with a hole on one side, and you'll find it on the left, right, or top edge of your iPhone. If you have an iPhone 14 or later purchased in the United States, there is no SIM tray —your device uses an eSIM, not a physical SIM card. You'll need to activate the eSIM rather than insert or replace a SIM card. [1] X Research source iPhone 14, 15, & 16 (including Plus, Pro, and Pro Max): If you did not buy your iPhone in the United States, the SIM tray is on the left edge. iPhone 12 & 13 (including Mini, Pro, & Pro Max): On the left edge. iPhone X, XR, XS, XS Max, iPhone 11 (including Pro & Pro Max): On the right edge. iPhone SE (1st, 2nd, 3rd generations): On the right edge. iPhone 4, 5, 6, 7, & 8 (including S, C, & Plus ): On the right edge. iPhone 3GS, 3G, and the original iPhone: On the top edge."

If you do not have a SIM extraction tool, don't worry—you can still open the SIM tray using the end of an unfolded paper clip, staple, toothpick, sewing needle, or even an earring post."
