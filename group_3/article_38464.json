[4] X Research source Your character starts the game with a mining pickaxe, a shovel, and an axe for chopping wood. To acquire a free fishing pole, visit the Fish Shop on The Beach on Day 2 after starting the game and talk to Willy.

Next, move your character in the same direction that the first arrow on the map is pointing until you can't walk any further that way. Repeat this strategy for every arrow on the map. [7] X Research source In the original version of Stardew Valley , the directions are left, up, right, up, right, down, left, down, left, and down. In the Stardew Valley Expanded mod , the directions are slightly different because the map changes between the oldest and more recent versions of the game. The directions for the mod version are right, down, left, down, left, and down. The starting and ending locations are the same. [8] X Research source"

I'm very displeased! Take this money and never speak of my 'project' to anyone.\" He gives you 750 coins to keep his secret.

Gourmand : Go to the secret fishing spot in Pirate Cove on Ginger Island and fish to pull this statue out of the depths. Iridium Krobus : Fish this pure Iridium statue out of the ocean near Cindersap Forest. Stone Junimo : Locate this statue behind the Community Center after you stumble upon Secret Note #14. Stone Owl : The Stone Owl spawns at completely random times. When you hear an owl hoot at night, expect to find the statue somewhere on your farm when you wake up the next morning. ??Foroguemon?? : Place a Strange Bun in Vincent's chest in the house at 1 Willow Lane, and you'll receive this odd lizardlike statue. ??HMTGF?? : Go to the Blacksmith's Shop and find a secret brown box surrounded by fences. Put a Super Cucumber in the box to get this weird yet funny-looking statue. ??Pinky Lemon?? : Find the purple box sitting surreptitiously in the back room of the Stardrop Saloon. Put Duck Mayonnaise inside the box and get the blushing statue. Statue of Perfection : Take care of your Stardew Valley community well for three years (in-game), and you'll notice that all four candles on Grandpa's Shrine are lit. That means you passed Grandpa's Evaluation and are worthy of receiving the Statue of Perfection as your reward. Junimo Plush : Obtaining this statue requires perfect timing! At noon on the 28th day of any season of the year, go to the bush behind the playground and interact with it. Make sure to interact with the bush before 12:10 PM, or you'll miss your window!"
