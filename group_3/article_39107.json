Pull off as much sticky back hook-and-loop fastener as you need and cut it to size. Then, pull apart the pieces and peel off the backing before you press a sticky side onto the fabric. Push firmly so the hook-and-loop fastener stays in place. [2] X Research source You can hand-sew sticky hook-and-loop fastener on most lightweight fabrics such as cotton or polyester. Avoid using denim since it's too thick to stitch by hand. If you only need to sew a little bit of sticky back hook-and-loop fastener, buy small sticky back coins or squares instead of tape."

      "content": "Thread a heavy-duty needle with polyester thread and knot 1 end. [3] X Expert Source Mia Danilowicz Master Tailor Expert Interview. 8 January 2021. Cut off an 18 to 20 inches (460 to 510 mm) long strand of polyester thread that matches your fabric. Insert the thread through the eye of a heavy-duty sewing needle and tie a knot at the other end of the thread. [4] X Research source Buy needles that say they're heavy-duty or made for denim on the package. If you use a thin needle, it's more likely to break as you push it through the tough hook-and-loop fastener pieces."

      "content": "Bring the needle through the corner of the hook-and-loop fastener to the front of the fabric. Insert the needle through 1 corner of the hook-and-loop fastener so the knot catches on the hook-and-loop fastener. [5] X Research source To make the knot more secure, bring the needle back up through the hook-and-loop fastener and push it down through the same spot you just stitched into."

      "title": "Straight stitch across each edge of the hook-and-loop fastener.",
      "content": "Straight stitch across each edge of the hook-and-loop fastener. Push your needle down through the hook-and-loop fastener to create a straight stitch, also called a running stitch. Then, bring it back up through the hook-and-loop fastener to make another stitch. To finish sewing, make a few backstitches and cut the thread. [6] X Research source Repeat this process for the opposite piece of the hook-and-loop fastener. Sew as close to the edges as you can when you're doing the straight stitch, so they don't curl up. Keep your stitches as small as possible so the hook-and-loop fastener stays firmly in place. [7] X Expert Source Mia Danilowicz Master Tailor Expert Interview. 8 January 2021. If you want the hook-and-loop fastener to be extra secure, straight stitch diagonally across the piece."

      "content": "Wipe away adhesive with acetone and lubricate the needle if it begins to stick. Although it's a lot easier to sew sticky back hook-and-loop fastener by hand, the needle might still become sticky from the adhesive. [8] X Expert Source Mia Danilowicz Master Tailor Expert Interview. 8 January 2021. If it does, stop sewing and wipe the needle with a cloth soaked in acetone or nail polish remover. Then, squirt a few drops of sewing machine lubricant onto another cloth and wipe it on the needle. [9] X Research source You may need to repeat this every few stitches or at least for every side you sew."

      "content": "Cut the hook-and-loop fastener to the size you need and press it onto fabric. Unroll as much of the sticky back hook-and-loop fastener as you need for your project and cut it. Then, separate the sides and peel off the backing to expose the adhesive. Position the sticky back hook-and-loop fastener on your fabric and press firmly so it sticks in place. [10] X Research source Although sticky back hook-and-loop fastener also comes in small coins or squares, these are too small to sew using your machine. To prevent the hook-and-loop fastener's corners from catching on fabric, trim each corner of the hook-and-loop fastener piece at a 120-degree angle. Since a sewing machine can easily stitch through heavy fabrics as well as lightweight ones, you can sew sticky back hook-and-loop fastener onto most fabrics. Just ensure that you have a strong needle so it doesn't break."

      "title": "Lubricate a heavy-duty sewing needle.",
      "content": "Lubricate a heavy-duty sewing needle. Since the sticky adhesive can gum up your sewing needle, install a new, heavy-duty needle. Then, squirt a few drops of sewing machine lubricant onto a soft cloth and wipe it on the needle. [11] X Research source The package of needles should say \"heavy-duty\" or that they're designed for denim. Set the oiled cloth aside since you'll use it when you begin sewing."

If your machine doesn't have a hook and loop presser foot, use a zipper foot so it doesn't catch on the hook-and-loop fastener. [12] X Research source"

      "title": "Set your machine to make small stitches so the machine doesn't skip.",
      "content": "Set your machine to make small stitches so the machine doesn't skip. Place the fabric under your needle so the hook-and-loop fastener faces up. Then, adjust the machine's stitch length to make straight stitches between 1.5 and 2.0 millimetres (0.059 and 0.079 in) long. If you make the stitch length longer than this, the needle may skip over the hook-and-loop fastener. [13] X Research source Use polyester thread, which is stronger than cotton thread and less likely to break. Don't try to do the zig zag stitch with hook-and-loop fastener since your machine may have a difficult time working back and forth."

Sticky back hook-and-loop fastener tends to curl up around the edges, so sew straight stitches along each edge of the hook-and-loop fastener piece.

      "content": "Wipe down the needle and lubricate it every few stitches. Your needle will get coated with adhesive gunk even though you lubricated it. Stop every 2 or 3 stitches and carefully wipe away the buildup using a cloth soaked in acetone or nail polish remover. Then, wipe the needle with the lubricated cloth you used earlier. To finish sewing, make a few backstitches and cut the thread. [15] X Research source Keep both cloths handy since you'll need to stop every few stitches to clean and oil the needle. Repeat this process for the opposite side of the hook-and-loop fastener."

Work as slowly as possible so your needle doesn't gum up or break.
