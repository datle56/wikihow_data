      "content": "Get a mount made for the weight of your TV. There are many different types of mounts you can get, but they need to be compatible with your TV and support its weight. Check the weight of your TV in its instruction manual or on the box, and write it down so you don’t forget. Search for TV mounts online or at electronics stores for one that fits the size of your TV. [1] X Trustworthy Source Consumer Reports Nonprofit organization dedicated to consumer advocacy and product testing Go to source If you want to ensure the mount is compatible with your television, search online for its model number followed by “mount” to find lists of compatible styles. Otherwise, you can get a universal mount that works with multiple styles of TVs. [2] X Research source Full-motion mounts allow you to tilt and turn the TV screen so you can position it however you want it. Set mounts don’t turn, but you may be able to adjust the direction it tilts up or down."

      "content": "Screw the mount’s bracket into the holes on the back of your TV. The TV mount has 2 parts; a bracket that connects to the back of your TV, and a mount that attaches to the wall. Take the bracket out of the packaging and line it up with the holes near the 4 corners of your TV. Use the screws provided with the mount to attach the bracket to the back of your TV.

      "title": "Find a proper place to mount your TV.",
      "content": "Find a proper place to mount your TV. The best viewing angle for your TV is so the center of the image lines up with your eye level, which is usually around 36–45 inches (91–114 cm) from the floor. Look for a spot in your room where multiple people will be able to see the TV once it’s mounted and you don’t have to arch your neck to look at it. [4] X Research source Ask two helpers to hold the TV at various heights while you sit down if you want to test which viewing angle is most comfortable for you."

      "title": "Check to see if your wall has studs with a stud finder.",
      "content": "Check to see if your wall has studs with a stud finder . Hold a stud finder flat against your wall and turn it on. Move the stud finder slowly across your wall until it beeps or until you see the display light up. If you’re able to find studs in the wall, then you can mount your TV directly to them. If you don’t find any studs in your wall, then you’ll need to use toggle bolts to hold the mount in place. [5] X Research source If you don’t have a stud finder, you can try knocking along your wall to listen for a solid sound, which means there’s a stud behind it. If your wall sounds hollow, then there are no studs. If there aren't any studs where you want to mount your TV, you'll need to purchase drywall mounts or toggle bolts."

      "content": "Mark 2 studs on your wall where you plan to hang the TV. Use your stud finder to locate 2 adjacent studs in the spot where you want to mount your TV. Once you find the 2 studs, use a pencil to mark them at the height you found earlier for the viewing angle. Check that your marks are the same height using a straightedge or a level. [6] X Trustworthy Source Consumer Reports Nonprofit organization dedicated to consumer advocacy and product testing Go to source If the studs don’t line up where you want to place your TV, then you’ll have to mount the TV without studs using toggle bolts . Some mounts can be attached to a single stud."

      "content": "Hold the TV mount against the wall to mark the holes. The part of the mount that connects to the wall will have multiple holes on the top and bottom. Put the mount against your wall so it’s level and mark the holes that line up with the studs. Pull the mount off of the wall and check to make sure the marks are level again. Aim to line up 2 holes in each of the studs so the mount hangs securely."

Hold the drill bit so it’s horizontal and drill through the marks you made for each hole.

Lift the TV carefully and position the hooks into the channels on top of the mount. Once the TV is on the mount, check if there are screws that hold it in place and tighten them if you need to. [9] X Research source Take a step back from the TV to check if it’s level. If it isn’t, grab it by the sides and carefully try to rotate it to make your adjustment. If the TV doesn’t move, you may need to loosen the screws again to reposition it. You can hide the wires inside a cable channel or inside of the wall with a power bridge."

Look at the holes on the top of the mount and choose 3 of them that are evenly spaced apart to make your marks. Mark 2 end holes on the bottom of the mount for the bottom support screws. Remove the mount from the wall and check if your marks are level. Since you don’t have studs to use for support, you need to use more screws to mount the TV to evenly distribute its weight."

Toggle bolts have a hinged wing on the end that holds the bolt securely against your drywall, and they’re hollow so you can screw things into them. Pinch the wings at the end of the toggle bolt and push them into the holes you drilled. Once the wings go through they will open and lie flush with the back of the drywall. You can buy toggle bolts from your local hardware store. Toggles bolts are typically not included with the TV mount."

Push the anchors in on the rest of your bolts so they’re flush with the wall.

Lift your TV up carefully on each side and line up the hooks with where they fit in on the mount. Slowly let go of the TV to make sure it doesn’t fall off the mounts before tightening any screws or bolts that hold the bracket in place. Have a friend help you lift the TV or look where the bracket lines up with the mount to ensure you have it in the correct place. Be sure to wipe down your TV screen to remove any fingerprints before viewing."
