      "title": "Drive over an active boost pad to obtain boost.",
      "content": "Drive over an active boost pad to obtain boost. You start each match with 34% boost, although it is optimal to obtain 100% boost before performing an aerial. There are two types of boost pads to drive over: 100% refill pads, which respawn after ten seconds, and 12% boost pads which respawn after five seconds."

      "title": "Approach the ball from your team’s side.",
      "content": "Approach the ball from your team’s side. Approaching from the direction of your team’s side of the field is ideal for hitting the ball towards your opponent’s goal post. Since boost propels your car forward, you will have more control and can attain a greater speed when driving forward. Visualize the shot. It’s optimal to hit the ball while it is at the apex of its arc in order to ensure that another player will not hit the ball before you do."

    {
      "title": "Jump when you’ve built up enough speed.",
      "content": "Jump when you’ve built up enough speed. The faster you are driving when you leave the ground for an aerial, the further you can hit the ball. When you have built up sufficient speed and gained proximity to the ball, jump into the air in the direction of the ball. To conserve boost for the aerial itself, speed up by accelerating the car and front-flipping to build speed."
    },
    {
      "title": "Pull the tail of your vehicle downward.",
      "content": "Pull the tail of your vehicle downward. The nose of your car should be pointing into the air and toward the ball. Boosting in the air will allow you to fly in the direction your nose is pointing at until you cease boosting or run out of boost. By boosting into the ball, you can hit it higher and at greater velocity than you would otherwise be able to."
    },
    {
      "title": "Perform a front-flip to maximize impact.",
      "content": "Perform a front-flip to maximize impact. Do this right before you hit the ball. It is important to note that you can only flip for the first 1.5 seconds that you have been in the air. After 1.5 seconds, you will have to land completely in order to flip again. To refresh your ability to flip, you may land on any surface, including the floor, walls, ceiling, or even onto the ball itself so long as all four wheels make contact with the surface."
    },
    {
      "title": "Orient yourself with the surface you will land on.",
      "content": "Orient yourself with the surface you will land on. After making contact with the ball, it is time to land. Orient your vehicle so that you are level with the surface that you are expecting to land on, whether it is the ground or a wall. Upon landing, slow down in order to ensure that you do not find yourself in between the opposing team’s goalpost and the ball and unable to hit the ball in the direction that will be the most beneficial. You can slow down by releasing the accelerator, holding reverse, or power sliding. Power sliding is advantageous in that it allows you to quickly pivot to face another direction."
    },
    {
      "title": "See if you can take another shot.",
      "content": "See if you can take another shot. It may be possible to take another shot on the ball in order to score a goal or set up your teammates to score. If no such opportunity exists, rotate back to your goal in order to acquire more boost and to provide defense should the other team take control of the ball."
