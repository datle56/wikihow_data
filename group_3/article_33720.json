Generic encouraging statements like, “You’re doing great!” or “I’m sure you’ll have an awesome day,” are nice to hear, but a more personalized message can be even more encouraging and meaningful.

This is easy when you’re trying to encourage someone you’re close to because you tend to know more about what they’re feeling in their situation. For example, you might say something like “I just know you’re going to land that job interview you’ve been wanting. Today is the day!”"
