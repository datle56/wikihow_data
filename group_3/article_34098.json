      "title": "Make sure the flowers and other corsage elements are tightly fastened together.",
      "content": "Make sure the flowers and other corsage elements are tightly fastened together. The stems will shrink slightly as the flowers dry, so if one or more flowers in the corsage seem loose, fasten them together with a rubber band, twine, or ribbon. Don’t tie them so tightly that the stems bend, however - if bound too tightly, the flowers won’t fully dry underneath the bindings. [1] X Research source Air drying works best on freshly bloomed flowers, so start the drying process as soon as possible."

      "title": "Hang the corsage upside down.",
      "content": "Hang the corsage upside down. Fasten it to a hook or hanger, and hang in a cool, dry place with good circulation. It’s best to keep the corsage out of direct sunlight as it dries, in order to minimize fading.

      "content": "Leave the corsage for 2-4 weeks, until fully dry. Check in on your corsage regularly over the next few weeks to make sure it’s drying. Once all the petals and leaves seem completely dry, carefully remove the corsage. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Spray your corsage with hairspray.",
      "content": "Spray your corsage with hairspray. Air drying can leave flowers a little bit brittle and prone to crumbling, but a coat of hairspray can help protect them. Use an aerosol can, rather than one with a spray pump, in order to spray more evenly.

      "title": "Find or purchase an air-tight container and silica gel.",
      "content": "Find or purchase an air-tight container and silica gel. Silica gel is a desiccant which will wick moisture out of your corsage, helping the flowers dry quickly and thoroughly while maintaining their shape. It can be purchased online, or at a local craft supply store or florist shop. Silica gel can be pricey, but it tends to produce better results than other desiccants and can be reused several times, until it turns pink. If you’re in search of a cheaper alternative, fine sand, cat litter, or a mixture of one part borax to two parts cornmeal all absorb moisture well and can be used in place of silica gel."

      "content": "Make sure your flowers are well-hydrated, but dry on the surface. If your flowers have already started to wilt, rehydrate them by recutting the stems at an angle and setting the corsage in a container of water for a few hours, until the petals perk back up. Wipe off any surface water when you’re done. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Bury your corsage in the silica gel.",
      "content": "Bury your corsage in the silica gel. Layer some desiccant in the bottom of the container, add your corsage on top, face up, and then sprinkle more desiccant lightly over the corsage until it is buried. Make sure the silica gel gets in every crevice, but be careful not to crush the flowers."

      "title": "Seal the container and store your corsage in a cool, dry place.",
      "content": "Seal the container and store your corsage in a cool, dry place. Check your corsage every couple days, and remove when dry. Depending on how much moisture your flowers contained when you first started the process, this method may take anywhere from one to several weeks. Try not to over-dry your flowers, or your corsage will be extra prone to shattering."

      "content": "Unearth your corsage after a couple of weeks. Pour out the desiccant until you can reach your corsage. Remove it carefully and gently brush off any remaining desiccant that’s stuck to it.

      "content": "Drop your corsage into a shadow box. These boxes are similar to picture frames, but are much deeper, so they can hold items that aren’t flat.
