You should notice numbers on your screen start flashing. [1] X Research source Depending on your watch model, the button may say Set instead of Reset. This process should work for every Armitron watch, but the location and order of the specific buttons may be different (they’re labelled). For example, on some models, the Reset button is on the bottom left instead of the top left."

      "content": "Press the Mode button to choose the hours, minutes, day, or date. The Mode button is usually on the bottom right side of your Armitron sports watch. Each time you press the Mode button, a different section of your screen display will start flashing. This way, you can easily switch between changing the hour, minutes, day, and date. Keep pressing Mode until you reach the value you want to change. [2] X Research source Whatever is flashing on your watch is the value you're changing. People often skip over the day on accident. You can cycle through the 7 days of the week when the small abbreviation for the day is blinking. It’s easy to miss on some models!"

After you’ve selected the value you want to change with the Mode button, press St/Stp until you reach the correct number. If you need to reach an earlier time or day, keep pressing the button until it cycles through again. [3] X Research source Check if you have the time set as AM or PM on your watch so all of the information is accurate. On some models, like the WR330, the St/Stp button may be labeled Adj. Refer to your manual to find out how you swap between 12- and 24-hour time modes. Typically, you press the Mode button repeatedly until you see the screen where you switch between formats and then select St/Stp to set the format."

Check your watch over the course of the next day to make sure the time is correct. [4] X Research source If there is a fourth button on your watch, it isn’t used to set the time or date. Usually, this button is labelled Light and it illuminates the backlight."

Pinch the crown in between your fingers and pull it out until it clicks once. If you hear more than 1 click, push the crown back in and pull it out slowly. [5] X Research source The crown on Armitron watches typically has two different positions. Pulling it one click adjusts the date, and pulling it 2 clicks adjusts the day of the week and time. If your watch doesn't display the date, then the crown will only click once to set the time."
