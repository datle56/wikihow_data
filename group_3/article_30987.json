      "content": "Mix red with a little bit of white. One of the easiest ways to make hot pink is to combine a basic red shade with a small amount of white. Think of it as a 3:1 ratio. Adding a smaller amount of white helps the red keep its vibrancy, allowing a hot pink shade to form. [1] X Research source Add more white to lighten the color of your paint to create a lighter pink shade. [2] X Research source Artist Jeanine Hattas Wilson recommends using the color Alizarin Crimson instead of a generic red to get a more “vibrant pink.” Alizarin Crimson is a deep, cool red shade with blue undertones, which can help make a more vibrant pink. Alternatively, you could use a Burnt Sienna paint, which is a warm red shade with yellow undertones. Using this paint to make hot pink can give you a color with more of a warm hue that isn’t as bright. [3] X Research source"

Start by adding equal amounts of yellow and crimson until you get a coral-like orange color. Then, add in crimson in small amounts until you reach your desired pink color. To brighten or add more vibrancy to the color, add a bit of white paint. Don’t be afraid to experiment!"

      "content": "Know your color wheel. The color wheel is a diagram that shows all the colors on the visible spectrum and how they relate to one another. [6] X Research source Most color wheels are divided into 12 colors and grouped into 3 categories: primary, secondary, and tertiary colors. Understanding these categories and how to read the wheel can help you mix paint. [7] X Research source Primary colors (red, yellow, and blue): These colors are the base of every color and sit opposite each other on the wheel in a triangular pattern. No mixture of colors can create these 3 colors. [8] X Research source Secondary colors (orange, green, and violet): These colors are made by mixing equal amounts of primary colors and sit opposite each other on the wheel in a triangle shape. Tertiary colors (red-orange, yellow-orange, yellow-green, blue-green, blue-violet, and red-violet): These colors are created by mixing equal parts of a primary color and the secondary color next to it. These are also known as intermediate colors. Complementary colors: Colors directly across from each other on the wheel, like yellow and violet. These colors have a strong contrast with one another. Analogous colors: A group of 3 colors next to each other on the wheel, like violet, red-violet, and red. These colors look the best together."

      "content": "Understand warm and cool colors. Colors have temperature, and knowing if they’re warm or cool can help you mix the best colors possible. Experimenting with mixing warm and cool tones can open up a new range of colors, and knowing what tone your desired end color is can help you find what colors to mix to achieve it. [9] X Research source For instance, if you mix a warm yellow with a warm blue, you’ll get a warm brownish-green olive. Warm colors have a brighter, more comforting tone (think of colors that remind you of the sun). [10] X Research source Cool colors have a more muted, icy tone (think of colors that remind you of the earth). Keep in mind that color temperatures don’t always line up neatly when mixing colors. Some colors in contrasting temperatures can be muddy when mixed, while others blend well—it’s all about experimenting! [11] X Research source"

So, if you mix a paint color that’s absolutely perfect while wet, it may dry to a different shade than you originally pictured. To avoid this, try mixing your ideal color and lightening it slightly with white. [14] X Research source Alternatively, test your paint on a different canvas or surface so you can see what it’ll look like once dried."

Here’s a quick guide: [15] X Research source To make a color lighter, add more water. To make a color brighter or more saturated, add less water or use it straight from the tube."

If you’re mixing hot pink paint with oil paints, you can use the same color recipes listed above but pay close attention to the transparency or opaqueness of the paints you’re using. Unlike acrylic paints, oil paints are defined by levels of opacity. Each paint tube is labeled as opaque, semitransparent, or transparent. This determines how saturated or bold the color is right out of the tube. Opaque paints cover a canvas completely, while semitransparent or transparent paints only cover the canvas partially. [16] X Research source Opaque oil paints are marked with a solid square on the tube. Semitransparent oil paints are marked with a square half filled in. Transparent oil paints are marked with an empty square."
