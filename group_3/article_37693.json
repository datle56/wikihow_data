      "content": "Remove the top of the pumpkin to access the seeds. If you haven’t already done so, use a sharp cutting knife to cut a circle around the pumpkin’s stem. Make sure the lid is wide enough for your hand to fit through comfortably. Remove the lid once you’re done cutting it. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Use a large spoon to scoop the seeds from the pumpkin.",
      "content": "Use a large spoon to scoop the seeds from the pumpkin. The bigger the spoon, the more seeds you’ll be able to remove at once. Scrape the sides of the pumpkin to loosen the seeds and pulp, taking time to scoop out as many seeds as possible. [2] X Research source You can also use your hands or an object from a pumpkin carving kit."
    },
    {
      "title": "Place all of the seeds and pulp in a large bowl.",
      "content": "Place all of the seeds and pulp in a large bowl. As you’re scooping out the seeds, place the seeds and pulp in a bowl big enough to hold everything. Remove large pieces of pulp from the seeds as you’re placing them in the bowl, but don’t worry about separating every single string. [3] X Research source If you’re removing the seeds from a smaller pumpkin, you may not need as large of a bowl."
    },
    {
      "title": "Set the seeds in a colander and rinse them under cold water.",
      "content": "Set the seeds in a colander and rinse them under cold water. This will help loosen the pulp and strings from the seeds, making it easier to clean them. Hold the colander full of seeds under the running water, using your hands to move the seeds around gently. [4] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Pull the seeds out of the colander and place them on a towel.",
      "content": "Pull the seeds out of the colander and place them on a towel. Once the seeds are mostly clean, take them out of the colander and set them on a clean kitchen towel. If there are any big strings still attached to the seeds, pull these off if possible. [5] X Research source You can also place the seeds on paper towels, though they may stick."
    },
    {
      "title": "Pat the seeds dry using the kitchen towel.",
      "content": "Pat the seeds dry using the kitchen towel. Spread the seeds out on the towel and gently blot the seeds to ensure they’re as dry as possible. Place the seeds in a bowl once they’re dry. [6] X Research source Instead of blotting the seeds, you can also shake them in the colander to remove excess water. If the seeds are still damp when they go in the oven, they won’t roast well due to the moisture."
    },
    {
      "title": "Toss the seeds with oil or butter.",
      "content": "Toss the seeds with oil or butter. Once the clean, dry seeds are in a bowl, pour cooking oil or melted butter into the bowl so that the seeds are lightly covered. Use a large spoon to mix the seeds around with the oil or butter so that each seed is covered evenly. [7] X Research source Use canola oil, olive oil, or vegetable oil. How much oil or butter you use will depend on how many pumpkin seeds you’re roasting, but it’s best to start with a small amount—you can always add more."

    {
      "title": "Add your desired seasonings.",
      "content": "Add your desired seasonings. These could be seasonings such as Worcestershire sauce, garlic powder, paprika, salt, pepper—whichever seasonings are your favorite. Sprinkle the desired amount of seasoning into the bowl of pumpkin seeds. [8] X Research source Experiment with the type and amount of seasonings, sprinkling in small amounts before adding more. For a simple yet tasty flavor, just add salt and pepper to your pumpkin seeds. Consider adding seasonings like chili powder, Cajun seasoning, or crab seasoning for a stronger flavor. Season with sugar, cinnamon, and nutmeg for a sweet snack."

      "content": "Stir the pumpkin seed mixture thoroughly using a large spoon. Stir gently, making sure the pumpkin seeds are evenly coated with oil or butter and your desired seasonings. If you notice that many seeds don’t have seasoning on them, feel free to sprinkle a little bit more into the mixture. [9] X Research source"

      "content": "Preheat the oven to 350 °F (177 °C) and prepare a sheet pan. Lining your baking sheet with parchment paper will prevent the seeds from sticking the best, though you can also use aluminum foil. Once the oven is preheated, you're ready to roast your seeds. [10] X Research source"

      "content": "Spread the seeds out evenly on the baking sheet. Pour the seasoned pumpkin seeds onto the lined baking sheet, using a spoon to spread them out. Try to make sure they aren’t clumped together and are laying flat so they roast evenly. [11] X Research source If your pumpkin seeds end up layered on top of one another, try baking them in two smaller batches to promote even roasting."

      "content": "Bake the seeds for 20-30 minutes, stirring them occasionally. Remove the baking sheet from the oven every 10 minutes and move the seeds around using a wooden spoon or other kitchen utensil—this will help ensure each seed roasts evenly.

Once the seeds have been removed and the oven is turned off, use a spatula to scoop the seeds into a bowl or other serving dish. You can eat them while they’re still warm from the oven, or let them sit for a few minutes until they’re cool. [13] X Research source"

      "content": "Store the seeds in an airtight container for roughly 1 week. If you want to save your roasted pumpkin seeds, put them in an airtight container such as a mason jar, plastic bag, or piece of tupperware. The seeds will stay fresh for a week or so at room temperature, or you can place them in the freezer for up to a month. [14] X Research source If placing the seeds in the freezer, they should be in an airtight container as well. Write the date on the container so you remember when the seeds were roasted."
