A nearby mango tree that produces good fruit will give you a seed that's the right variety for your climate. If you live in a warm climate with mild winters, you can probably find a healthy mango tree in your area. [1] X Trustworthy Source EDIS Electronic database of the University of Florida Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences's peer-reviewed articles Go to source If you can't find a mango tree, you can order seeds or buy them in a shop. Make sure to choose a variety known to grow well where you live. [2] X Research source You can also try to plant a seed from a store-bought mango. However, it will be a lot more difficult to help the seed survive in your climate, especially if the mango traveled to your grocery store from another state or country. Still, it's worth a try!"

Next, carefully cut open the pit husk with kitchen scissors and remove the seed. [3] X Research source A healthy mango seed will look tan and fresh. Sometimes seeds turn gray if they're exposed to cold temperatures, and if this happens, the seeds aren't usable. [4] X Research source You might want to wear gloves when handling the seed. Mango seeds produce sap that can cause skin irritation. [5] X Research source"

Then pour water onto the paper towel until it's translucent and you can see the seed inside it. Put the seed in a plastic bag, seal it up, and let it sit on a sunny windowsill for 3 weeks. [6] X Research source Check the paper towel every few days to see if it's dry. If it is, add a little bit more water so the paper towel is damp again. After 3 weeks, the mango seed should have sprouted some tiny roots! If you also notice a little bit of white mildew on the outside, it's still okay to plant it."

With the concave side of the seed face down, push it into the soil about 1 in (2.5 cm) or until only the top of the seed is barely visible. Leave the top of the seed partially uncovered so you can monitor its health as it grows. [8] X Research source If the seed stays green, that means it's in good health and you should leave it alone. If it ever turns brown or black, that means it's rotting. At that point, dig out the rotting seed and replace it with a fresh one."

It's also important to keep it inside for now, especially if you don't live in a tropical area and experience a lot of cold weather.

It's now just the right size to transplant into the ground in your lawn and survive against weeds and the elements. [11] X Research source If your seedling becomes too large for the pot you initially planted the seed in, transplant it to a larger pot. First, fill the larger pot with the same soil you used in the smaller one. Next, gently loosen the soil around the seedling with a knife, taking care not to disturb the root ball. Pull the seedling out of the smaller pot and plant it in the new one. Push soil around the stem to cover the root ball and then water the seedling."

[13] X Research source When planting the seedling in its final position, find an area in your backyard with good drainage. Also, think about the future: it must be an area where the full-grown tree won't interfere with any buildings, underground plumbing, or overhead power. Clear away any weeds and bushes that might crowd your mango tree and compete with it for water resources."

[14] X Research source Be careful not to break the seedling as you transplant it. Mango trees grow well in a lot of different soil types, but especially in light sand and limestone.

      "content": "Prune the upper branches of the mango tree after September. September is the end of the harvest season when the mangoes are mature. Even if your tree isn't producing fruit yet, it's still a good idea to get in the habit of waiting to prune it until after this time. Pruning will not only help you control the size of the tree, but it will also help you keep fruit-bearing branches lower and easier to pick. [21] X Trustworthy Source EDIS Electronic database of the University of Florida Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences's peer-reviewed articles Go to source To prune your mango tree, use sharp pruning shears and focus on trimming the ends of the outermost and uppermost branches. This will help you control the tree's size and make it look less overgrown without hurting the tree or reducing fruit-bearing branches. [22] X Research source Briones suggests pruning the lighter-colored upper branches and leaving the thicker, darker branches closer to the trunk alone. This decreases the risk of creating open wounds in your tree that will lead to disease and water evaporation."

      "content": "Monitor it for diseases and pests and treat as needed. Mango trees don't often become infested by insects or infected with diseases. But it can still happen sometimes! Common mango tree diseases include algal leaf spot, anthracnose, and powdery mildew. Some of the most important pests to watch out for are fruit flies and mealybugs. Here's a brief guide to dealing with these issues if they come up. [23] X Research source Algal leaf spot : An algae that leaves rust-colored spots on a mango tree's leaves. It's harmless, but it's also not very pretty. You can help protect the tree from algal leaf spots by ensuring the tree has plenty of space between other plants to grow and breathe and with regular pruning. Anthracnose : A disease caused by humidity that results in your mango flowers and fruits developing black lesions and dropping from the tree. The best way to control it is to apply a copper-based fungicide to the tree when it's gotten a lot of rainfall and the humidity in the area is high. [24] X Research source Powdery mildew : A gray-white fungus that grows on mango leaves, flowers, and fruits. Applying the same copper-based fungicide you use for anthracnose should take care of this pesky disease. Fruit flies : Flies that burrow into mangoes and lay eggs inside, causing the fruit to rot. You can harvest the mangoes as soon as they're ripe to prevent these insects from making a nest. Alternatively, you can set up outdoor fruit fly traps to catch them before they even make it inside the fruit. Mealybugs : Tiny insects that lay eggs in the soil around the mango tree and suck up its sap. This can cause the flowers on the tree to wilt and the fruit to drop. You can usually get rid of them by simply cleaning up leaves and twigs surrounding the tree. You can also wrap the base of the tree in a polyethylene sheet and apply a layer of grease on the bottom of the polythene to prevent the mealybugs from climbing up the trunk."

But you can still grow them even if you live in the United States. It helps to live in zone 9B, where winter temperatures don't typically dip below 25–30 °F (−4 – −1 °C); but if you live in a cooler area, you can grow still mangoes in containers and bring them indoors during freezing weather. [25] X Research source The Cogshall mango variety is a popular choice for growing indoors and can be kept permanently at 8 ft (2.4 m) tall with regular pruning. Even smaller dwarf varieties exist for people with limited space. [26] X Research source"
