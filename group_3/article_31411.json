      "content": "Keep your focus on your footing when using stairs. You probably use stairs so often that you sometimes don’t even think about it when you’re going up or down them. But slips on stairs are one of the leading causes of injury, which suggests that it’s so mundane that people don’t pay enough attention to their footing. [1] X Research source When walking down unfamiliar stairs, be careful to attend to each step. [2] X Research source Avoid looking at your phone, a book, or any other distraction while using stairs. Be aware that stairs may be uneven, especially on older stairways, so tread carefully! Always wear your glasses or contacts when using stairs to ensure you have the best, most accurate view of what’s beneath you."

      "title": "Take your time on each stair.",
      "content": "Take your time on each stair. Pacing is key. Take the stairs one at a time, and avoid skipping steps. Go slowly and avoid hurrying or running down stairs, especially on steep, curved, or cramped stairways. Remember that it’s always better to be safe than quick. Pay special attention to the first and last 3 steps, which is where many accidents occur."

      "content": "Use handrails and encourage others to do so. Handrails are there for a reason, so use them! They can dramatically reduce falls for everyone from small children to older adults. Teach those who use the stairs, whether in your home or workplace, the importance of holding a handrail when walking down stairs. [3] X Research source Hold the handrail for the entire length of the stairs, and keep one hand on it at all times."

      "title": "Supervise those with limited movement on the stairs.",
      "content": "Supervise those with limited movement on the stairs. Keep an eye on and aid small children and older adults who cannot safely access stairs. If you can’t keep a constant watch, install safety gates at both the top and bottom to prevent them from using the stairs without help. [4] X Research source Make sure that the latch on the gate is properly closed at all times you need the gate to be effective. Pressure gates are designed to fit between a door frame between rooms. Never use a pressure gate to block a stairway, as it will not be secure."

      "title": "Install handrails, stair rails, and other safety guides.",
      "content": "Install handrails, stair rails, and other safety guides. Stair rails are the railings built around landings, while handrails are designed to be used when walking down stairs. Make sure that all railings are about 30–38 in (76–97 cm) high, and are also a consistent height along the entire stairway. [5] X Research source Make sure the rails allow for an adult person's hand to wrap around it, and are free of splinters or rough areas that might injure the hand. Also make sure the handrails extend at least the length of one stair at the bottom and top of the staircase to allow for ease mounting and dismounting, and are ideally on both sides. Consider installing a seated stair elevator to assist those with limited mobility."

      "title": "Remove clutter and other messes from the stairs.",
      "content": "Remove clutter and other messes from the stairs. Small objects like toys or other knick knacks are serious tripping hazards, so pick them up as soon as you spot them. Also clean up any spills or other messes you see on the stairs as soon as possible to keep the steps safe. [6] X Research source Make sure nothing is loose or sticking out of stairs, such as loose boards, nails or other building debris. Avoid placing loose rugs at the top or bottom of stairs. These may shift and result in falls."

      "title": "Improve the visibility of stairs with bright paint or tape.",
      "content": "Improve the visibility of stairs with bright paint or tape. Many falls are caused by improperly judging the distance between each step. If stairs are more visible, these judgments are easier. Improve visibility of stairs in your home or workplace by adding definition to each stair. [7] X Research source One way to do this is to add bright paint or tape to the edge of each step. Use matte paint—not glossy—to avoid any glare from lights which may impair ability to gauge depth. For carpeted stairs: Avoid patterned carpet, as these may obscure the depth of each step. Carpet your stairs with monochrome, single-colored carpeting instead."

      "title": "Provide adequate lighting in the room or for each step.",
      "content": "Provide adequate lighting in the room or for each step. The amount of lighting recommended for safe access of stairs is 50 lux, which is about the minimum amount of light that people require to read. Make sure that there’s either enough ambient light in the room to see each step, or that each step is lit by its own individual light placed 5–6 in (13–15 cm) above each. [8] X Research source Lights can also be placed within each stair, lighting the stair below, or lit from underneath. Stair lighting is an opportunity to be creative. If you find yourself around stairs without adequate lighting, use a flashlight."

      "title": "Install and maintain adequate stair treading.",
      "content": "Install and maintain adequate stair treading. Allowing stairs to become worn, smooth, and slippery encourages falls. Reduce risk of falls by installing non-slip surfaces on the stair. These include treads or mats , grippy tape , metal strips, or slip-resistant paint to the entire step to the leading edge. [9] X Research source Also monitor the condition of carpeted stairs. Keep these free of any loose threads, and replace the carpeting when it becomes worn to the underlying mesh. Consider closing the gaps of open-backed stairs with wood paneling. For outdoor stairs: Scatter ice melt across outdoor stairs in cold climates to prevent stairs from freezing."

      "title": "Wear stable footwear when using stairs.",
      "content": "Wear stable footwear when using stairs. Shoes with good treads will help support your feet as you walk down stairs. High heels, slippers with soft soles, or socks are more likely to allow for slips down stairs. Remove these, or opt for grippy sneakers or rubber-bottomed socks. [10] X Research source If your ankles are weak, make sure you also include ankle support when walking down stairs. A turned ankle may result in a fall. Keep your feet turned slightly out for better stability."

      "title": "Avoid overly tight or long clothing.",
      "content": "Avoid overly tight or long clothing. It's easy to step on long, flowing skirts or pants when walking up and down stairs, and tight, restrictive clothing can limit your range of motion, causing imbalance. Make sure you’re wearing garments that won’t cause you become tangled or uncoordinated before you take the stairs. Or, gather the excess material in one hand as you walk, and hold the stair rail with your other hand. If you must wear tight skirts, walk up and down stairs by putting both feet on each stair, rather than alternating stairs. Or, hike the skirt as far up your thigh as you modestly can. This allows your knees more leeway, and aids in walking up and down stairs more safely."
