      "content": "Swipe left or right to turn left or right. You'll want to do this as soon as your character reaches a turning point in the path. Swiping left or right while running on a straight part of the path will cause your character to stumble, which will forfeit your current bonus. Stumbling twice in a row will cause the enemies behind you to catch you, thereby ending the game."

As your time in a specific run progresses, the character's speed and the maze's complexity both increase. If your character stops running at any time (e.g., because of stumbling twice), the game ends."

      "content": "Collect coins when possible. Coins both increase your score and count toward in-game purchases, such as power-ups and character skins. Yellow coins are worth one coin each, red coins are worth two, and blue coins are worth three. Don't prioritize coin collection over safe running if you're going for a high score. The magnet power-up will collect coins for you."

You can unlock each of the game's power-ups from the STORE section of the home page for 250 gold apiece, though upgrading them after this point will cost significantly more. These power-ups include the following: 50 Coin - Immediately grants your character 50 coins. Coin Magnet - Gathers coins for you so that you don't have to run through them to collect them. Invisibility - Allows you to run through obstacles and over gaps for a brief time. 250m Boost - Makes you invincible and boosts you forward for 250 meters of running. Double Value coins - While not technically a power-up, upgrading this attribute shortens the distance you need to run before coming across red and blue coins. You can also purchase \"Utilities\", which are items to help you in-game. Tap the screen twice to use them."
