      "content": "Center yourself with good posture, steady breathing, and mindfulness. Before praying, take a deep breath, get comfortable, and close your eyes to help free your mind . Focus on the here and now, along with centering yourself in whatever way feels right. The idea is to sink into your prayers and not just say them; you can do this in the same way you’d practice meditation , notes licensed psychotherapist Ira Israel. Saying Buddhist prayers can feel similar to performing a meditation, but they are not the same thing. Buddhist prayers are focused on showing gratitude to the Buddha, while meditations are focused on your general inner awareness. Candles, scents, and low lighting can help calm you down and bring you closer to your prayer. Psychotherapist Ira Israel notes, “Sit with your spine erect, chin level, and jaw unclenched for 2 minutes in the morning. Concentrate on your breath, an image, or do a body scan. Choose a meditation that works for you and then gradually try some new meditations.”"

      "content": "Learn some basic mantras. Buddhist prayers consist of mantras, which are chanted phrases meant to be repeated over and over again. You do not necessarily need to know their full meanings, as the words themselves, through repetition, lose their \"meaning\" and help you avoid distraction.

Om mani padme hum: Pronounced “ohm man-ee pad-mae hoom.” Translation: “Hail to the jewel in the lotus.” Purpose: Helps you embrace enlightenment and compassion in yourself and others. Oṃ Amideva Hrīḥ : Pronounced “om ami-dehva re.” Translation: “To overcome all obstacles & hindrances.” Purpose: This mantra asks the universe to help you overcome any challenges that you’re facing.

      "content": "Remember that prayer is a way to connect to your spiritual self. Buddha is not a creator god, though some practices do see him as divine. That said, prayer is not meant as an offering to Buddha. Rather, it is a way to deepen your own spirituality. If you feel like praying, then you should pray, and worry about the theology later. You can, of course, make up your own specific mantras, and think about your own ways to pray, as there is no wrong way to practice. Your practice can range from being a way to meditate to becoming a Buddha , meaning to achieve the highest level of spiritual awakening. [6] X Research source There is a vast array of prayers and no right way to pray as a Buddhist. This frees you to practice your prayer and spirituality how you desire it, not how you are told."

Let me not do the slightest thing for which the wise might rebuke me. Instead let me think: May all beings be well and safe, may they be at ease. Whatever living beings there may be, whether moving or standing still, without exception, whether large, great, middling, or small, whether tiny or substantial, Whether seen or unseen, whether living near or far, Born or unborn; may all beings be happy. Let none deceive or despise another anywhere. Let none wish harm to another, in anger or in hate. Just as a mother would guard her child, her only child, with her own life, even so let me cultivate a boundless mind for all beings in the world. Let me cultivate a boundless love for all beings in the world, above, below, and across, unhindered, without ill will or enmity. Standing, walking, seated, or lying down, free from torpor, let me as far as possible fix my attention on this recollection. This, they say, is the divine life right here. [11] X Research source"
