      "title": "Go to Craigslist and click post an ad.",
      "content": "Go to Craigslist and click post an ad . You might need to change your location first if the one you see is not accurate. The link to create an ad is in green text on the left side of the page."

    {
      "title": "Select a category.",
      "content": "Select a category. You have to choose what type of posting you're creating before you can continue. Each category has subcategories to pick from. Choose the one that most suits the needs of your ad. For example, if you are selling a video game system, be sure to put it in the “video gaming” category and not the “toys & games” or “electronics” category. This will make your ad easier to find. If your ad fits multiple categories, try to find the most applicable one. Click Continue when you're done."

    {
      "title": "Come up with a title.",
      "content": "Come up with a title. The title is the first thing that people browsing Craigslist will see. Make sure that it is both eye-catching and informative. If you don’t give enough details, people may not click the ad to see what you’re offering. If you are selling something include a few descriptions of the quality of the object you are selling. Make sure to lead the title with the object, followed by some descriptors. Use caps sparingly to add emphasis. Consider some of the following phrases: LIKE-NEW One owner Mint NEED TO SELL Works GREAT If you are listing an apartment or house, use homey words to create a sense of comfort in the reader. Include the basics of the property, including number of bedrooms and bathrooms, as well as square footage."

    {
      "title": "Add a description.",
      "content": "Add a description. The description is the bulk of your post. This is the body of your ad, and what users look to for details. Set yourself apart with good grammar and spelling. Be as detailed and to the point as possible. Tell a story. This is a very useful tactic when selling something. Never say you want to get rid of something because you don’t like it anymore. Instead, let someone know that you’re upgrading, or that you need to sell because you’re moving. Talk up the product. Approach the ad as a salesperson would. Tell the reader why he or she needs your product as opposed to all the others that showed up in their search results. Include specs and details to make the ad appear more professional. Compare your asking price to the object’s initial cost. This will drive home the value that the reader will be getting if they buy from you. It helps put the price into perspective. This is very useful for more expensive items. When advertising a rental property, give a detailed description of both the interior and exterior. Discuss the good aspects of the neighborhood, such as schools, close proximity to good food, recreation, etc. Mention any new renovations. Also make sure that you outline when new tenants can move in, as well as rental costs. Taylor adds that if you are offering a job, include the position, the amount of time the job is expected to take, as well as compensation. Discuss qualifications needed, as well as what applicants can expect if they get hired. If you are offering your services for potential employers, sell yourself. Play to your strengths and list everything that you are capable of (in regards to that particular field). Treat the post as you would a cover letter for a resume. Let anyone who reads it know that you are the best person for that job. If you are writing a personal ad, get creative! Make your post stand out with witty writing, poems, and more. A unique post is much more likely to get noticed than a typical “dating site” post. Craigslist is a crazy and anonymous place, so have fun and be safe! If you are posting to find a relationship, remember to sell yourself much like you would a product. List all of your strengths, and what makes you unique. Be assertive in your post, and let readers know that you know what you want. Make sure that your personality shines through in your writing. Be sure to avoid any identifying personal information. Make initial contact through an email that can’t be connected to your real name, address, or occupation."

      "title": "Add posting details.",
      "content": "Add posting details. Don't forget to add information like the zip code or neighborhood if it's relevant information (like in a job listing or house-for-sale ad). Use the drop-down boxes to add more information. You don't want to leave boxes blank since they offer more information to anyone looking at your post. This includes make/manufacturer, model name/number, size/dimensions, and condition. The fields differ depending on the category you selected earlier. For instance, if you selected \"Resume/job wanted > I'm an individual seeking employment,\" you'll see \"Education\" listed under the Posting details header; a post categorized by \"for sale by dealer > furniture\" will have the \"size/dimensions\" section under the Posting details header. Some listing categories won't see the \"Posting details\" section and can skip this step."

      "title": "Add your contact preferences.",
      "content": "Add your contact preferences. Add your email address so you can be easily contacted by those who are interested in your listing. To be safe, use the CL mail relay to communicate with others without revealing your email address. Some categories on CL also offer the CL Chat, which is another safe option to use when you're chatting with others on Craigslist. You also have the option to publish your phone number, but that's a risky option since you can get calls from anyone."

    {
      "title": "Add location info.",
      "content": "Add location info. Under the \"Location info\" section, you can add an address or location to pick up an item that's for sale. If you don't want that section, uncheck \"Show address\" and it will remain hidden from your post. Click Continue to proceed to the next page."
    },
    {
      "title": "Include pictures in your post.",
      "content": "Include pictures in your post. Use the Craigslist picture uploader tool to add photos from your computer to your post. You can add multiple pictures, but the first one is the one that will appear next to your listing. Pictures help immensely when selling a product. If a reader is looking for a physical object to buy and there is no picture, they are very likely to skip over it. Potential buyers like to be able to see the condition of what’s for sale. When selling a car, make the first picture a profile shot of the car. Use the other photos to show the interior and other angles. When advertising a rental property, show the front of the house or apartment in the first shot. Use the other picture for interior shots, as well as the backyard and other angles. If you’re posting a personal ad, you have to decide how comfortable you are with posting your picture for strangers to see. If you do decide to use a picture, make sure that it is flattering and does not violate any Craigslist rules. Click done with images to continue."

      "title": "Edit your post.",
      "content": "Edit your post. The final page is a preview of your ad. You can spice up the HTML in your listing to make it stand out by clicking Edit post at the bottom of the page. Craigslist supports basic HTML coding for some posts, which allows you to manipulate the text. You can make text bold, italic, and different colors, use bullet points, and more. Check out the Craigslist help page for specifics on the code that is available and how to use it. Using bullet points for features can really help buyers understand your item much quicker as opposed to having it all in paragraph form."

      "title": "What should I avoid when posting on Craigslist?",
      "content": "What should I avoid when posting on Craigslist? Never include personal info like your name, address, or picture. You should include contact information though, as ads without contact info look suspicious. Also, avoid posting back-to-back ads, don't use words like \"free\" or \"credit card\", and avoid all caps in your title—these all make your ad(s) look like spam."
