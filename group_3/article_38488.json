      "title": "Have confidence.",
      "content": "Have confidence . Men are attracted to confidence. In fact, many men find confidence more attractive than pure physical beauty. Try to be a bit more assertive about your interests, goals, and ideas. This will prove attractive to most men. It's important that you feel confident and attractive when trying to gain the interest of a man. In other words, do not try to be something you're not. Be yourself and be upfront about your interests and passions . This goes for online dating as well. While a cute profile picture might get a man to click on your profile, he won't end up messaging you if you have generic information included in your \"About Me\" section. Let your personality show in your online dating presence as well."

      "content": "Dress in a flattering fashion . When first meeting someone, most people assess them visually. If you're trying to seduce a man, make sure you dress in a flattering fashion to get his attention. Remember, confidence is key. If you don't feel sexy, you won't appear that way to a man. If you're more comfortable in jeans and tees than dresses, try picking a flattering, sexy casual outfit rather than forcing yourself into an evening gown. If you're unsure how to dress in a flattering way, try asking a stylist at a department store to help you pick outfits that work for your figure or frame."

Men might not notice right away that you've changed your hair, but they will notice you're looking more put together. This can be attractive. Much like planning an outfit, pick something you feel good about rather than catering explicitly to a man's interests. While a guy might say he prefers long, layered hair, if you feel sexiest with a short bob that will be conveyed in how you act with your new style. [8] X Research source Talk to a hair stylist about what style and color would be most flattering for you."

These do not have to be fantasies you intend to engage in, but just sharing secret desires can enhance both of your sex drives. Talk about scenes from movies or television shows you found arousing. You can even try watching some of these films together to get you both in the mood. A fun game to play can be \"Never Have I Ever\" , but a sexy version. In this game, you both take turns saying something sexual you've never done but have always been curious about. This can be a fun predecessor to physical contact."

Try focusing on these areas when you first start making out. [10] X Research source The scalp is also a highly sexually charged area for men.

      "content": "Wear lingerie . Men respond well to visual stimuli. Try wearing lingerie. This can help get a man in the mood. Once again, pick something you feel most confident in. If you don't feel sexy, you won't come off that way. If you feel uncomfortable shopping for lingerie alone, take a friend with you. You can also purchase items online, but the downside is you cannot try items on beforehand. If you purchase something online, make sure there is a return option. Many lingerie stores have highly helpful staff who are trained to help people pick items out. While it may feel awkward, asking a staff member for help can be a great way to assure you pick something flattering that makes you feel confident. [12] X Research source Understanding colors that suit your skin tone , eye color and hair color can definitely help make you look more sexy and provocative. Psychologically, men can't help being attracted to women who wear red, so that's definitely a good color to start with if you're not sure, or maybe black. Be confident in your body. Some women are curvier than others. Some women are skinny, others have more body fat. This is nothing to be ashamed of. No guy will be attracted to a girl who's covering up her body while attempting to seduce him, or whose ribs are easily visible because she's starving herself. You'll find that most guys won't care if you've got some fat on you. Some women also think that if they are \"flat chested\", they are somehow lesser than other women. Bigger does not mean better. Guys won't care how big your breasts are as long as you show that you are confident with who you are as a person."

Do not be afraid to be dominant in the situation. Initiate sexual contact. Try to have the man follow your lead sexually. Many men find this arousing and enjoy sex more with women who display sexual confidence. [13] X Research source"
