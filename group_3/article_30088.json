[1] X Research source Or devise your own simple pattern with a few simple rectangles, drawn out in pencil on cardstock or kraft paper. Label each piece and then cut them out of cardstock or craft paper. If you're creating your own pattern, the main wallet body piece should be roughly 11 in (28 cm) long by 7.5 in (19 cm) wide. This main piece will also have 2 snap tabs for closures. Each tab will be a square measuring 2 in (5.1 cm) on all sides. Draw these squares on the left side of the wallet body piece, about 0.5 in (1.3 cm) from the top and bottom with about 2.5 in (6.4 cm) of space in between them. Each card pocket piece should measure about 4 in (10 cm) long by 2 in (5.1 cm) wide. Make between 1 and 3 card pockets for the right side of your wallet. If you're adding a change pocket, make this pattern piece about 3 in (7.6 cm) by 3 in (7.6 cm)."

      "content": "Trace the pattern pieces onto the leather. Place 1 pattern piece onto the leather and trace around the outside of it with chalk or a colored pencil. Then move on to trace the rest of the pattern pieces, 1 at a time. [2] X Research source A supple piece of vegetable-tanned cowhide leather would be suitable for this project, although other animal leathers would also work. Order a small piece, no more than 1 to 2 ft (0.30 to 0.61 m) long, from an online retailer, a local fabric store that carries leather, or a specialty leather retailer. Leather thickness is measured in ounces. Choose a leather weight between 3 to 6 oz (85 to 170 g) for your wallet. A lower weight will result in a slimmer and less bulky wallet. Feel free to use the same piece of leather for the entire wallet or switch it up with different leathers for the pockets."

      "title": "Cut the leather pieces out using a rotary blade.",
      "content": "Cut the leather pieces out using a rotary blade. Place your leather on a cutting surface, with the marked lines facing up. For the cleanest cut lines, place a metal ruler against one of the pattern line you just traced. Press a sharp rotary blade into the leather and draw it along the side of the ruler. Cut along each line until all of the pattern pieces are free. [3] X Research source Move the blade slowly and be very careful not to slip. Keep in mind that this cut edge will be the finished edge of the wallet. Trim off any nicks along the cut edge before moving ahead. If you don't have a rotary blade, try a sharp utility knife instead. Either a self-healing cutting mat or a kitchen cutting board would be suitable surfaces to place the leather on before cutting it."

      "title": "Tape or pin the pockets in position on the wallet body.",
      "content": "Tape or pin the pockets in position on the wallet body. Lay the card pockets on top of one another so that the top 0.5 in (1.3 cm) of each pocket remains visible. Center this stack of pockets on the upper right quadrant of the wallet body. Place the 3 in (7.6 cm) square change pocket in the center of the upper left quadrant of the wallet body. Use masking tape or sharp metal push pins to hold the pockets in place. [4] X Research source If you're using pins, place one in each corner of the pockets. Note that this will puncture the leather so make sure that you have the layout correct. If you prefer to have more card pockets, just cut out a few more of these pieces instead of cutting out a change pocket. Stack them together and center them on the upper left quadrant of the wallet where the change pocket would otherwise go."

      "title": "Punch holes around the outside edge of each pocket and into the wallet body.",
      "content": "Punch holes around the outside edge of each pocket and into the wallet body. Use either an awl, rotary punch, or a sharp metal push pin to punch holes through the pockets and down into the wallet body. The holes in the wallet body should be located directly beneath the holes in both sets of pockets. Continue until you've added holes to the bottom and sides of each pocket. [5] X Research source These holes will be where your needle passes through when you're sewing the wallet together. Don't punch holes along the top of the pockets. You also don't need to add holes along the outside edge of the wallet body during this step. Make sure you don't nudge the position of the taped or pinned-down pockets. You want to keep the holes in alignment across all the layers of leather. Place a piece of thick leather hide below your wallet if you're using a rotary punch. Doing so makes it easier to punch holes in the leather."

Use a basic straight stitch to hand sew each pocket to the body of the wallet, along the bottom and sides of each pocket. Finish it off with another knot when you're done. Then remove the tape or pins. [6] X Research source If desired, use a lighter to carefully burn the knot, melting the wax together for a more permanent hold. Start from the inside of the wallet (the side with the pockets) to hide the knot. Create the straight stitch by passing the thread in and out of the holes created with your rotary punch. Make sure the pocket holes are lined up with the holes in the wallet body as you do this. For added strength, complete 2 rows of stitching instead of just 1."

Pinch the 2 square snap tabs together and fold them over the edge of the wallet. Press a push pin through the center of the tabs until it punctures the wallet body in the correct spot. [7] X Research source To fold your wallet, first fold in half lengthwise (so that the bottom half of the wallet body is folded up behind the top half containing the pockets). The 2 snap tabs should line up. Then close the wallet by folding it in half crosswise, touching the 2 sets of pockets together."

      "content": "Set each piece of the snap closure into the snap tabs and wallet body. You'll be using a metal set-in snap which consists of 4 parts: a front and back for the “female” half and a front and back for the “male” half of the snap. Use a metal cup and anvil to attach the components to the leather. [8] X Research source The snap cap will go on the of the bottom snap tab. The snap stud will go on the top snap tab. The cap and stud be attached, with the leather of both snap tabs sandwiched in between them. These pieces create the “male” part of the snap. The socket will go on the lower-right side of the wallet body, and the open prong will go on the other side of the leather, directly behind the socket. Together these pieces create the “female” part of the snap. You can purchase a kit for metal set-in snaps online. Make sure it comes with a metal cup and anvil that match the size of the snaps you're using."

Then use your rotary punch, awl, or metal push pin to punch stitch holes along the bottom and both sides of the wallet body. The holes should go through both layers of leather. [9] X Research source Don't punch holes along the top of the wallet. By keeping this open you'll have a wide pocket for paper bills."

Start from the inside of the wallet, with the pockets facing up, to hide the knot. Burn the knot to melt the wax if you want a more durable knot. Stitch around 2 times for additional strength.

You can use a single color for the whole wallet, or 2 solid colors to create a contrasting pocket. Alternatively, try using 1 solid color fabric with 1 patterned fabric for contrast. [10] X Research source If you purchase 0.25 yd (0.23 m) of each fabric, you'll have more than enough to make 1 or more wallets. But smaller fabric remnants would be fine to use as well.
