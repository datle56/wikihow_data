Improve your living arrangements when a roommate is on vacation. Make your living environment something your roommate will be excited about when she returns. Even if it is simply cleaning and organizing, it will be an improvement. This will give you something to do, and the pay-off will be positive. Add plants to bring in a living energy into your living space. Clean the windows and screens. Everyone enjoys a clean fresh view outside. Paint a fence that has gotten rusty. Fix squeaky doors, leaking faucets, or take broken items to be fixed. Improve the curb appeal of your house.

If your spouse is deployed, tell her that you plan to complete a project like building a wood deck in the backyard. If you have children, join together on a project that will help all of you get through the time of absence. Start the garden you have always wanted. Raise funds for a cause that benefits the military or a cause that is important to your spouse. Reporting your progress to your spouse will help her feel like she is missed, but also that she is still loved and needed at home."

Excuse yourself from the social scene for a while, or confide in close friends or family members. Some people are more private with their feelings, and that’s perfectly acceptable. Writing down your thoughts can help pinpoint the feelings that are causing you pain. Don’t be embarrassed about being upset, even if other people think your relationship was not serious.

Whether the loss is a relationship, a loved one, a job, a physical ability, or trust in someone, the damage created must be understood and managed. Grief is a complex emotion that manifests in different ways for everyone. Feeling stuck in the state of missing a person is worsened by unresolved grief. There are stages to the grieving process that can be used as a guide to understand your own unique experience with grief: denial, numbness and shock; bargaining; depression; anger; acceptance. Grief is an individual journey. Everyone experiences it differently, and you may spend more time in one stage versus another. Don’t rush yourself and don’t allow others to rush you through your grief. There is a time to grieve and it is essential to a healthy healing process. Really dig deeper and ask yourself whether this was the right relationship for you, or were you just really attached to this person? If you know it wasn't a good relationship, it can be really helpful to remind yourself why it wasn't working.

It will make missing the person much easier when you don’t see the items on a daily basis. If you find that something is so special to you that you absolutely can’t part with it, then put it in storage for a while. If you feel too much pain doing this alone, ask a friend to help you.

Do not call or text your ex just to see how things are going. It will only make you feel worse. If you are forced to see him at school, work or elsewhere simply acknowledge him by saying, “Hello,” and spend as little time as possible in his presence. Your emotions will likely heighten after seeing him, which may cause you to miss him. This is temporary so stay strong and work through it. Disconnect from him on all social media channels.
