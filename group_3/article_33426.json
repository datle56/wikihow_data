If you're at a casino, place the amount of poker chips you wish to bet on the space labeled Ante. At home, you'll need a way to designate each player's Ante, Play, and Pair Plus® bets without getting them confused. Some casinos require that each player places an Ante bet, while others allow the player to bet solely on Pair Plus® (see below). Casinos often have a \"table minimum\", requiring each bet to be at least the posted amount."
