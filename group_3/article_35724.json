Then, hold onto the cylindrical sprayer at the top of the bottle and gently pull it straight up to expose the short, vertical nozzle underneath it. [1] X Research source The sprayer on your perfume may be metal or plastic depending on the fragrance you have. If you have trouble pulling the sprayer off, wrap it in a paper towel and grip it with a pair of pliers. Metal travel atomizers can’t be refilled from a splash bottle without a sprayer."

Align the plastic opening on the travel bottle with the nozzle on your main perfume bottle, and gently push down.

Continue lifting the bottle up and down and watch the tank fill up on the side of the bottle. Keep pressing the bottle down until the tank is full.

Then, slowly press the sprayer back onto the nozzle before putting the cap back onto the main perfume bottle. [4] X Research source A bit of perfume may spray out when you put the sprayer back on, so point the bottle toward a sink so it doesn’t get into your eyes. It’s normal if your travel bottle doesn’t spray perfume for the first few pumps after you fill it. The first few pumps remove the air from the bottle before it starts spraying perfume."

Then, simply push down on the sprayer to spritz the fragrance into the new bottle. Keep spraying your perfume until you fill the travel bottle with the amount that you want. [6] X Research source Leave at least 1 ⁄ 4 in (0.64 cm) of space at the top of your travel bottle so you can easily replace the sprayer. Put a small funnel in the mouth of the travel bottle to help catch all of the perfume so it doesn’t make a mess. Alternatively, take the sprayer off of the main perfume bottle and fit a plastic syringe over the nozzle. Press down on the nozzle and pull the syringe plunger up to pull out the fragrance. Then, put the syringe down in the travel bottle and press the plunger down to fill it. [7] X Research source"

Use a steady and slow pour so you don’t accidentally overfill the bottle. When the bottle is about ¾-full, stop pouring the perfume. [10] X Research source Since splash bottles don’t have an atomizer that sprays, you apply it by dabbing a small amount of perfume or cologne onto your neck or wrist."
