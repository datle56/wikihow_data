Even during these days, you're still moving forward. I‚Äôm so glad you‚Äôre a part of my life. I look forward to doing all I can to support you.

These might include jokes and stories that will help lift their spirits,‚Äù says Anbar. Here are a few lighthearted and funny messages to make them smile: I bought you these healing crystals. I don‚Äôt think they actually do anything, but they‚Äôre pretty, and they make great weapons. The only thing I know more stubborn than cancer is you. It's one of your best qualities, and it's your secret weapon. Chemo sucks. But if it sucks the cancer out of you, then‚Ä¶ yay! I have to admit. I‚Äôm kind of impressed at your body‚Äôs ability to grow things in inappropriate locations. Losing your hair during chemo just means you have one less thing to mess with in the morning. They say laughter is the best medicine. Unless you have cancer, in which case chemotherapy is much more effective. There really are no good words for this situation‚Ä¶except swear words. Lots of swear words. As if cancer stands a chance against you! It‚Äôs clearly picked the wrong person to mess with. Just think, you get to take medication that‚Äôs more expensive than a month‚Äôs salary. So lux. I know you are worried about losing your hair, but it can‚Äôt make you look any worse than that at-home perm your mom gave you in 10th grade! There‚Äôs, like, a small chance radiation will give you superpowers. So There‚Äôs that. Well, there is one positive thing to your diagnosis: Now you can play the cancer card! You‚Äôre on the road to recovery, and I‚Äôll be riding shotgun! Now, when someone complains about their bad hair day, you can shut them down every time."

Talking to kids about their cancer diagnosis can be tough, but it‚Äôs important to be helpful, accurate, and truthful. It‚Äôs also important for them to stay connected with their friends and family members during their treatment. [5] X Trustworthy Source National Cancer Institute An agency in the National Institutes of Health focused on cancer research and patient support Go to source Use one of these phrases to help you know what to say to a kid you care about who‚Äôs dealing with cancer: I wish only good things for you and your family. Is the medicine that the doctors and nurses are giving you making you feel better? I hope so because we can‚Äôt wait until you are home again! A superhero is someone who faces tough times with the bravest heart. Psst‚Ä¶that‚Äôs you! I wish I could take this pain away for you. So many people are cheering you on!

My greatest wish is for you to be well again, and I‚Äôm going to help you get there. I‚Äôm sorry you are going through this. It really sucks."

But these phrases can come off as insensitive or trite. In most cases, it‚Äôs better to just be honest and say, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sure what to say.‚Äù Then tell them you care about them. [6] X Research source Here are a few unhelpful phrases cancer patients hear and what to say instead: ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt even look sick.‚Äù Instead, say something like, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so sorry you have to go through this, but I‚Äôm here if you want to talk.‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll be fine.‚Äù Instead, say something like, ‚ÄúHow are you feeling today?

      "content": "Be a good listener when they need to talk. Letting a cancer patient know you are there for them and ready to listen when they want to talk is one of the best things you can do to support them. ‚ÄúAsk if they would like to talk about their illness. If so, listen rather than offering to help solve their problem,‚Äù says Anbar. Tell them you know they may not want to talk, but you‚Äôll be there when they do. Be an active listener by giving them your full attention without interruptions. Show you‚Äôre listening by maintaining eye contact and responding to what they say with nods and appropriate facial expressions. If they pause, ask questions to confirm what they‚Äôve said or get clarification like, \"So, you'll be going for treatment three days a week, right? Will you have a set schedule, or will it vary?\" ‚ÄúAnd sometimes it's just not saying anything,‚Äù says House. They might just need someone to sit with them."

      "title": "Acknowledge and validate what they‚Äôre feeling.",
      "content": "Acknowledge and validate what they‚Äôre feeling. Being diagnosed with cancer can cause a range of emotions. Let them know that whatever it is they‚Äôre feeling is perfectly understandable. Try not to jump immediately to cheering them up, which can feel dismissive. Anbar says, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt say you understand how they feel, as each person‚Äôs feelings are different.‚Äù Let them feel what they feel. If they‚Äôre sad or scared, a good cry might really help them work through their emotions. [7] X Research source It can be upsetting to see someone you care about deal with their emotions, but staying strong and being there for them is a great way to offer your support even if you don‚Äôt say a word. Acknowledge their feelings by repeating what they‚Äôve said to show you‚Äôve heard them. For example, say something like, \"I hear you saying that you're scared you won't be around to see your son graduate. I can‚Äôt imagine how terrifying that is, but I‚Äôm here to listen whenever you need me.\""

      "content": "Offer to help in specific ways. We‚Äôre often told to ask, ‚ÄúHow can I help?‚Äù in these situations, but it might be more helpful to think about what they might need at that moment, says House. People don‚Äôt always know what they need or may feel uncomfortable asking for something. Help them out by offering to do specific tasks like giving them a ride to their doctor's appointment or picking up their prescriptions. Anbar adds, ‚ÄúYou might offer to help with daily life activities such as making a meal, vacuuming, shopping, or providing transportation.‚Äù If you offer to help them, make sure you follow through to show you really are there to support them. And if you know you don‚Äôt have time to do something, offer to do something else. However, sometimes people don‚Äôt want help. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt repeatedly offer help that they reject, as this will cause them to feel unheard or disrespected,‚Äù says Anbar."
