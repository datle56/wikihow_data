      "content": "Help keep their spirits lifted with an encouraging message. One of the biggest mistakes some people make when a friend or loved one receives a cancer diagnosis is to say nothing. [1] X Research source Cancer is scary for everyone, but even a short note of support and encouragement can make a huge difference to someone going through treatment. Try sending one of these encouraging messages: Hope may be elusive, but it’s always there. Keep holding on—we’ll get through this together. Remember that it's okay to have tough days. Even during these days, you're still moving forward. I’m so glad you’re a part of my life. I look forward to doing all I can to support you. Cancer may have underestimated your indomitable spirit. Stand tall, for you have the power to overcome any obstacle. I care about you. I hope each day something makes you smile. Cancer cannot cripple love, cannot shatter hope, cannot conquer the spirit. You are not facing cancer alone. We will get through this together. The road may be long, but your strength, faith, and determination will carry you through. No matter the diagnosis, you are important, you are loved, and you continue to make a difference every single day. Keep your face always toward the sunshine, and shadows will fall behind you.

You are not alone—your support system is here for you. Take the time you need to heal, and always remember that you are surrounded by love and support."

I don’t think they actually do anything, but they’re pretty, and they make great weapons. The only thing I know more stubborn than cancer is you. It's one of your best qualities, and it's your secret weapon. Chemo sucks. But if it sucks the cancer out of you, then… yay! I have to admit. I’m kind of impressed at your body’s ability to grow things in inappropriate locations. Losing your hair during chemo just means you have one less thing to mess with in the morning. They say laughter is the best medicine. Unless you have cancer, in which case chemotherapy is much more effective. There really are no good words for this situation…except swear words. Lots of swear words. As if cancer stands a chance against you! It’s clearly picked the wrong person to mess with. Just think, you get to take medication that’s more expensive than a month’s salary. So lux. I know you are worried about losing your hair, but it can’t make you look any worse than that at-home perm your mom gave you in 10th grade! There’s, like, a small chance radiation will give you superpowers. So There’s that. Well, there is one positive thing to your diagnosis: Now you can play the cancer card! You’re on the road to recovery, and I’ll be riding shotgun! Now, when someone complains about their bad hair day, you can shut them down every time."

      "content": "Show a kid with cancer you care with an age-appropriate message. Talking to kids about their cancer diagnosis can be tough, but it’s important to be helpful, accurate, and truthful. It’s also important for them to stay connected with their friends and family members during their treatment. [5] X Trustworthy Source National Cancer Institute An agency in the National Institutes of Health focused on cancer research and patient support Go to source Use one of these phrases to help you know what to say to a kid you care about who’s dealing with cancer: I wish only good things for you and your family. Is the medicine that the doctors and nurses are giving you making you feel better? I hope so because we can’t wait until you are home again! A superhero is someone who faces tough times with the bravest heart. Psst…that’s you! I wish I could take this pain away for you. So many people are cheering you on!

      "title": "Some well-meaning comments may not be helpful to a cancer patient.",
      "content": "Some well-meaning comments may not be helpful to a cancer patient. There are common statements many people rely on when they aren’t really sure what to say. But these phrases can come off as insensitive or trite. In most cases, it’s better to just be honest and say, “I’m not sure what to say.” Then tell them you care about them. [6] X Research source Here are a few unhelpful phrases cancer patients hear and what to say instead: “You don’t even look sick.” Instead, say something like, “I’m so sorry you have to go through this, but I’m here if you want to talk.” “I’m sure you’ll be fine.” Instead, say something like, “How are you feeling today? I’m here to listen.” “That’s the good cancer.” Instead, say something like, “I want you to know I love you, and I’m going to be here with you every step of the way.” “Everything happens for a reason.” Instead, say something like, “I just wanted to let you know that I care about you.” “I’ve heard that ‘X’ cures cancer.” Instead, say something like, “Have you and your doctor decided on a care plan? Do you need help getting to appointments?” “You are so strong and brave.” Instead, say something like, “I’m so sorry you have to go through this, but I’m here to help you be strong.”"

      "title": "Be a good listener when they need to talk.",
      "content": "Be a good listener when they need to talk. Letting a cancer patient know you are there for them and ready to listen when they want to talk is one of the best things you can do to support them. “Ask if they would like to talk about their illness. If so, listen rather than offering to help solve their problem,” says Anbar. Tell them you know they may not want to talk, but you’ll be there when they do. Be an active listener by giving them your full attention without interruptions. Show you’re listening by maintaining eye contact and responding to what they say with nods and appropriate facial expressions. If they pause, ask questions to confirm what they’ve said or get clarification like, \"So, you'll be going for treatment three days a week, right? Will you have a set schedule, or will it vary?\" “And sometimes it's just not saying anything,” says House. They might just need someone to sit with them."

      "title": "Acknowledge and validate what they’re feeling.",
      "content": "Acknowledge and validate what they’re feeling. Being diagnosed with cancer can cause a range of emotions. Let them know that whatever it is they’re feeling is perfectly understandable. Try not to jump immediately to cheering them up, which can feel dismissive. Anbar says, “Don’t say you understand how they feel, as each person’s feelings are different.” Let them feel what they feel. If they’re sad or scared, a good cry might really help them work through their emotions. [7] X Research source It can be upsetting to see someone you care about deal with their emotions, but staying strong and being there for them is a great way to offer your support even if you don’t say a word. Acknowledge their feelings by repeating what they’ve said to show you’ve heard them. For example, say something like, \"I hear you saying that you're scared you won't be around to see your son graduate. I can’t imagine how terrifying that is, but I’m here to listen whenever you need me.\""

      "title": "Offer to help in specific ways.",
      "content": "Offer to help in specific ways. We’re often told to ask, “How can I help?” in these situations, but it might be more helpful to think about what they might need at that moment, says House. People don’t always know what they need or may feel uncomfortable asking for something. Help them out by offering to do specific tasks like giving them a ride to their doctor's appointment or picking up their prescriptions. Anbar adds, “You might offer to help with daily life activities such as making a meal, vacuuming, shopping, or providing transportation.” If you offer to help them, make sure you follow through to show you really are there to support them. And if you know you don’t have time to do something, offer to do something else. However, sometimes people don’t want help. “Don’t repeatedly offer help that they reject, as this will cause them to feel unheard or disrespected,” says Anbar."
