To make the heart shaped nail tip, you will need the following materials: a nail file, a clear base coat, nail polish in a deep red color, a base polish in a neutral color and a top coat in a clear color. [1] X Research source For your neutral color, select a tan or light pink polish. Skip the neutral color and opt for a more fun contrasting color, like a light blue or hot pink."

      "content": "File your nails. To make your nail tips into hearts, you will first need to reshape the nail tips. File the tips of your nails into rounded points – these will serve as the base of your painted hearts. [2] X Research source If your nails are on the shorter side, try to round the nail tip out as much as possible. To round your nails, run your file across your nails repeatedly in the same direction, then round the edges on either side of the nail."

Apply two coats of your base polish, allowing the nails to dry between each coat of paint. [3] X Research source Make sure any previous polish has been completely removed before applying the base coat. To paint nails quickly, draw a line down the middle of your nail with your brush, then fill in the nail area on either side of your line."

      "content": "Add the hearts. Use your red polish brush to draw an angled half circle on the right half of your nail tip. Then make another angled half circle on the left half of your nail tip. [4] X Research source The two half circles should overlap, forming the top of your heart. Do two coats on your heart, making sure to allow the heart to dry in between coats. When the tips of all your nails have dried, add your top coat to seal the manicure."

To draw a heart on your nail with a toothpick, all you’ll need is a base coat, a nail polish in your preferred color, red nail polish, a piece of paper or foil, a toothpick and a top coat. Avoid using a quick dry polish – this will get sticky too fast. Try juxtaposing your red heart against a baby blue polish or changing out the red polish for gold glitter polish. If you don’t have a toothpick, try substituting a bobby pin."

Allow both hands to dry, before painting on an additional coat of polish. Make sure all of your fingers are completely dry before proceeding to the next step. For a fun Valentine’s Day look, paint the fingers white so the hearts will pop even more."

      "content": "Add the heart. Pour a small amount of the red nail polish onto the piece of tin foil or paper. Allow the puddle of polish to sit for one minute so it can thicken slightly. Dip the toothpick into the polish and make a dot on your left ring finger. Make a second dot next to the first dot. Use the toothpick to drag one of the dots down, creating a 45 degree angle. Drag the other dot down to meet the first dot, creating the heart. Do the same thing on your right ring finger. Allow the hearts to dry completely, before painting on one coat of top coat."

Attach the corner of one piece of tape to the bottom of your nail, then angle the other two pieces of tape so they make a point at the tip of your nail. Alternatively, you can cut a heart shape out of a single piece of tape. If you look at your nail, the space not covered by tape should form an upside down heart. If the tape doesn’t line up on your first attempt, un-stick it and try again."

Rip the tape off each nail as soon as you’re done painting the heart – otherwise, the polish will become sticky and hard to remove. Apply the tape and paint the heart nail on each of your fingers. Then give the hearts time to dry. You can either leave the hearts alone, or choose to outline them in the silver polish. To do this, dip your toothpick into the silver polish, then use the toothpick to carefully outline the heart on each nail. After each nail has dried, paint top coat on each nail, then give the nails an additional hour to dry completely."
