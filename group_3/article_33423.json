      "content": "Set up a bank. One trusted player, or an outside party, should collect and count the money, or whatever you are wagering, and exchange it for poker chips for each player. If you are not playing for money, still the bank should divvy out an equal number of chips to each player. There are a couple ways to organize your game from here. \"No limit buy-in, winner takes all\". [1] X Research source In this version, each player buys into the game with a set amount—perhaps $5 for a friendly game, hundreds or more for serious wagering. There is no limit on how many of their chips a player can bet at once—you can go \"all in\"—but when a player runs out he or she is out of the game unless allowed to buy back in for another share of chips just as new players can buy-in during the first 2 or 3 days of the tournament with hundreds playing, coming and going. In these tournaments players are usually eliminated one by one by leaving it all on the table until the last remaining player wins the whole pot. But, in some large tournaments, the last 10, 20,30,... or 100 to go out get an increasing take-home, up to the ultimate winner's set pay amount (not the amount of the table pot). \"Limit, No Buy-in\". In these games betting at each stage of the hand is not allowed to go all in, and also players can usually buy more chips at any time. This means that instead of playing the original chips until eliminated, players can wager until they are no longer willing to put up more money. Often, a player can \"cash out\" of the game to take their winnings or cut the losses at any time."

Starting with the player to the left of the big blind, each player must call (meet) or raise (increase) the current stakes to stay in the hand. If a player chooses to bet or raise, the next player must meet (\"call\") or raise that new bet, and so on. Raises must often be in increments of the minimum (big blind) bet. If a player does not wish to call or raise the current bet, he may fold by pushing his hold cards to the dealer into the muck/discards, quitting the pot and sitting out the rest of the hand. Betting goes around the table clockwise until every player has either folded or called or re-raised. If one player makes a bet none of the remaining players are willing to at least match, the hand ends and that player wins the pot without a showdown. He may muck his hand or choose to show either one or both of his hole cards (showing one or both cards when at least one is pretty good is a way of establishing or helping your reputation, \"see, I play when I have good cards, see this [one]?\"). [4] X Research source When betting circles the table and returns to the small and big blind players, these players subtract the money they've already put in from the current call. Thus if no player had bet more than the minimum, the big blind has the \"option\" to either raise or stay in the game at no additional cost by checking. The small blind owes 1/2 of the minimum plus the amount needed to buy up to the call. If the minimum were $100, then the small blinds needs to pay in $50 to pay-in the minimum to the pot."

A straight that runs as high as Queen beats a straight that only runs up to 10. An Ace-high-flush beats a King-high-flush. If hands have combinations of the same value, the hand with the highest extra card wins. For example a pair of 8's with an Ace-high remainder (\"kicker\") beats a pair of 8's with a 10-high. If both had the Ace kicker then you proceed to the next highest card in each hand. Kickers are very important in hold'em. If your opponent opened the pot with AK and you call with KQ, then a king comes on the flop, the pair of kings will likely make you bet higher, but now he has the Ace kicker..."

      "content": "Going \"all-in.\" If you are very confident your hand will win, or you believe no other player will be willing to match you, you can push all your chips on the line—a bold move. In a tournament, if \"you're down to only 5 more big blinds/antes\" then you'll be out after 5 rounds around the table if you don't make a stand, so you will want to go all-in pre-flop with a reasonably good hand, hoping to double up or get everyone to fold. If you have only 5 times the blinds and antes, just picking up the blinds and antes means a 20 percent increase for you, which is huge. So, for example, if you have any pair, any ace, any king, or any two face cards, strongly consider going all-in pre-flop -- if no one has yet entered the pot. You are \"short-stacked\" compared to other players and to the blinds/antes. If making any reasonably sized bet will put half or more of your stack into the pot, you are pot-committed and may as well go all-in to look stronger and apply maximum pressure. Even if you have the nuts (the best possible flop with your hold cards), don't try to slow-bet and raise just the minimum if you are already pot-committed. Any opponent with the slightest bit of observation will become suspicious why you did not simply go all-in, if you are strong. In any case, your opponents are likely to interpret an all-in from a short stack as a desperate move and call if any of them have a reasonably good hand. If you have enough more chips than an opponent who has a wager on the table, you may \"put him or her all in\" by betting equal to their total chips (you can say \"all-in\"). If no other player calls and the shorter stack doesn't fold, both reveal their cards in the showdown -- then any remaining community cards are dealt out one by one without any more wagering on each (because the all-in player has no more chips to bet with). If the other person wins you double that player up, but you have a chance to send that player home."

This is called a \"side pot.\" Set aside one pot equal to the bets made up to each remaining player each calling the \"all-in.\" This first match up is what the original all-in player can win. The remaining players can bet against each other into a separate pot, saying \"okay I'll raise you [maybe even putting you all in, unless you fold to limit your additioanl exposure]\". At the showdown the main pot goes to the player with the best hand, and the side pot (or pots) go to best hand amongst the players who contributed to that, and one \"or more\" go home, if the wagers put you and/or others all-in as well. [10] X Research source If you have a reasonably good hand, say AQ, and a short-stack in front of you has pushed all-in, probably as a semi-/pure-bluff, you could also raise all-in yourself as an isolation play, as few players will call a raise and a re-raise in front of them without a very good hand like QQ or better. Your move will help you isolate the short-stack who likely would make the all-in with a weaker hand than you have. If one player is already all-in and there is no money in the side pot yet, be inclined to just check unless your hand improves, because without any side pot money to play for, it doesn't make sense to try to bluff out others and increase the odds of winning for the all-in player. Checking the hand down maximizes the probability of eliminating the short-stack who is already all-in. This is known as cooperation play."

Slow-playing works best with loose aggressive players that you hope will try to bluff when no one has bet/as if they have nothing. If you flop a full house and bet out, everyone folds and you only win a small pot. So just check and let others lead out, as you try to catch a card on 4th or 5th street. Be careful, though, that you don't slow-play and get many opponents checking to see draws. For example, if you hold T(♥) - T(♠), and the flop comes T(♣) - 9(♦) - 3(♣) for \"trips T's\", and you now have three or more opponents in the pot.
