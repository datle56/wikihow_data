      "content": "Oblong faces are long and narrow. This face shape is also sometimes called a “rectangular” face shape; it’s similar to the square shape but elongated and slender, with the forehead, cheekbones, and jawline all approximately the same width. Oblong faces can also feature a high forehead, well-defined oval chin, high cheekbones, and long nose.

      "content": "Feminine hairstyles Opt for textured and layered hairstyles if you have an oblong face. Volume is key: the fuller your hair looks while framing the sides of your face, the better! Steer clear of flat, straight hairstyles with minimal volume. Curly or wavy hair is ideal, especially with face-framing layers, side-swept bangs, and a side part. Here are a few specific ideas: [2] X Research source Wide waves: If you have natural waves, flaunt them! If not, you can use a flat iron to create a wavy pattern in your hair. Aim to have the widest waves hit around your cheekbones. Blowouts: Give your hair a blowout when styling it by blowing around your face with warm air, then lightly spraying your hairline with hairspray to give it more volume and keep it away from your face. Bangs: Whether you opt for side-swept, curtain, or blunt bangs, they can definitely help shorten your face. Loose curls: Curls look fantastic with oblong face shapes—so if you have them, wear them loose and wild-looking to create more width around your face. Try teasing your curls to create even more volume! Lob (long bob): Lob haircuts typically fall close to shoulder length, and a layered lob is perfect for an oblong face. You could also opt for an asymmetric lob with bangs! Messy bun: When you want to put your hair up in a bun, leave a few pieces to hang loose and frame your face. Choppy shag: Shag hairstyles are the perfect option when you want volume and lots of layers—and the best part is they work with any hair length and texture! Curly bob: If you prefer wearing short hair, a curly chin-length bob with a soft side part is best; the curls will add width to your face. You could alternatively opt for an angled or French bob to create the illusion of a rounder face. Pixie cut: Want to go even shorter than a bob? A rounded pixie cut with soft bangs can shorten your forehead and create the illusion of width. Mid-length or long hair: Get long layers at the eye and cheekbone level for added texture, keeping the sides of your hair away from your face."

      "content": "Masculine hairstyles Just as with feminine styles, a flattering masculine hairstyle for an oblong face should add some width, with volume on the sides of your head. Additionally, you can wear a beard to shorten your face and visually counterbalance its length. Specific masculine hairstyle ideas include: Side-swept: For a side-swept style, keep the hair on top of your head parted to one side; this can break up the length of your face and add some width. Shortened sides and back: Keep the sides and back of your hair trimmed short with a little extra length on top, and opt for a side part to add dimension. Messy and tousled: Keep your hair at a medium length overall, and use texturizing products to give it a naturally tousled look with dimension. Fringe: Opt for a textured fringe to break up the length of your face and make your forehead look a little shorter while keeping the sides of your hair full."

      "content": "Glasses Glasses with striking frames and tall rims are ideal, but many styles will look good on an oblong face shape. Keep an eye out for bold, thick frames that can balance out the length of your face—even better if they have a pop of color! Your frames should highlight your eyes and add width while downplaying the length of your face. Try: [3] X Research source Square glasses. Their sharp angles and strong shape will complement and accentuate your facial features. Cat-eye glasses. Their wider frames can add dimension to your face while highlighting your eyes and upper facial features. Aviator glasses. Aviators feature wide, teardrop-shaped lenses that work perfectly with an oblong face. Glasses with decorative temples. Any pair of glasses with some sort of decoration at your temples can add width to your face."

      "content": "Contour your jawline and temples. If you wear makeup, you can easily use it to create a flattering effect for your oblong face shape! As with hair, glasses, and other accessories, the goal is to add width and dimension to your face—and contouring can help with this! So, start by contouring your jawline and temples to create the appearance of more width than is actually there. [4] X Research source Apply a darker makeup shade to the hollows of your temples and blend it up toward your hairline. Then, apply the darker makeup under your chin and blend it to contour your jawline. Need more contouring tips? Check out our guide to contouring oblong faces !"

      "title": "Use blush and highlighter to emphasize your cheekbones.",
      "content": "Use blush and highlighter to emphasize your cheekbones. Because oblong faces are long and straight, they can sometimes look a little flat in the cheekbone area—so a combination of blush and highlighter can add some extra dimension and depth. First, apply blush horizontally across the apples of your cheeks. You don’t need a lot of it! Then, use highlighter on your cheekbones to make them stand out. While you have the highlighter out, you could also apply some to the center of your forehead (to add to the contouring there)."

Wear earrings with colors closer to your skin tone (light gold for pale skin and bronze shades for darker skin) if possible. Additionally, wear shorter necklaces and chokers as opposed to longer pendant necklaces. [6] X Research source If you have a long necklace, you could loop it around your neck a couple of times to make it appear shorter and add some depth to your look."

      "content": "Measure your face and compare it with common face shape features. Using a ruler or flexible tape measure, take note of the following facial dimensions. First, measure from the center of your hairline to the bottom of your chin (the length of your face). Then, measure the width of your face a few different ways: across your forehead, cheekbones, and jawline. Compare the measurements to determine your face shape . [9] X Research source If your face fits the description above—longer than it is wide with your forehead, cheekbones, and jawline all similar widths, you have an oblong face shape! To be more precise, oblong faces tend to be around 1.5 times longer than they are wide (though this doesn’t have to be exact). If your face measurements don’t fit the description for an oblong shape, check the section below on other face shapes to see which one fits you better."

If you need a visual, picture an oval face like an upside-down egg—wider top, narrow bottom. Oval faces also have high cheekbones, tall foreheads, and balanced features.
