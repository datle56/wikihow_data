      "content": "Pour 2 L (8.5 c) of distilled water into 2 large, reusable containers. Double-check that you’re using exactly 1 L (4.2 c) for your buffer. Always use distilled water instead of tap so the pH can be as accurate as possible. You can find distilled water at most stores selling laboratory supplies. Each container should have 1 L (4.2 c) of distilled water in it."

Measure exactly 71.5 mL (0.302 c) into the container so the mixture can be exact. [3] X Research source The container needs to be able to hold at least 1 L (4.2 c) of fluid."

Check that you’re adding exactly 28.5 mL (0.120 c) to the mixture, so the buffer’s pH can be as accurate as possible. [4] X Research source The ratio needs to be exact, or else your buffer may not have the right pH."

If the pH isn’t exact, you may need to create a new mixture using more exact ratios of dibasic sodium phosphate and potassium phosphate. [5] X Research source You can get a pH testing electrode at most places that sell laboratory supplies."

Keep it in a cool area for safekeeping, and use it whenever you need to neutralize a mixture. After a few weeks, toss out the buffer and make a new one, since phosphate buffers can be a breeding ground for small organisms over time. [6] X Research source"

You can make your mixture as acidic as 5.8 or as basic as 8.0, depending on the ratio of your buffer. Pour in a 47.35 mL (0.2001 c) of Na₂HPO₄ in a separate container eto make your buffer more basic, and a smaller amount to make it acidic. [9] X Research source For instance, a buffer with 47.35 mL (0.2001 c) of Na₂HPO₄ would yield a buffer with a pH of 8.0, while 4 mL (0.017 c) would give you a pH of 5.8."
