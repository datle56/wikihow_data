      "content": "Write the alphabet and numbers 1-9 on the border of a piece of paper. To make your gameboard, choose a large, white sheet of paper that’s no smaller than 8.5 by 11 inches (220 mm × 280 mm). Starting at one corner, write the letters A-Z (in order) along the edge of three sides of the paper. On the fourth edge, write the numbers 0-9. [1] X Research source Writing the alphabet will allow the spirit to spell out answers to your question. Some questions may require a numerical answer (like how old the spirit is or when they were alive), which is why it’s also important to include the numbers."

      "title": "Write the words “START,” “END,” “YES,” and “NO” in the center.",
      "content": "Write the words “START,” “END,” “YES,” and “NO” in the center. In the middle of your paper, write simple words like “START,” “END,” “YES,” and “NO” in large writing. These words can be used by the spirit to provide quick answers to simple questions—it’s always faster to ask a yes-or-no question than one that requires more explanation. [2] X Research source The “START” and “END” options can also be used to begin or end the game, as will be explained in further steps."

      "title": "Choose a dark, dimly lit space in which to play the game.",
      "content": "Choose a dark, dimly lit space in which to play the game. Play the game in a dark room or in an open, outdoor area at night. Most often this game is played at night as spirits are said to be more active late in the day. Light the space with a dim light or candle to set the scene for the spirits and make them feel more comfortable. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Place a coin on “START” and have each player place a finger on it.",
      "content": "Place a coin on “START” and have each player place a finger on it. Sit 3-4 players in a circle around your game board. Place your coin on “START” and have each player gently place a pointer finger on the coin. Remind players not to apply any pressure to the coin or attempt to move or push it. Have each player close their eyes and concentrate on mentally inviting the spirits into the game. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Have any of your players call the spirit by saying “Spirit, come.”",
      "content": "Have any of your players call the spirit by saying “Spirit, come.” Any player from the group can begin the game with the words “Spirit, come.” Have them continue to say this phrase until the coin begins to move across the board. If there’s a specific spirit your group would like to call, you can replace the word “spirit” with their name—however, keep in mind that there’s no guarantee of that particular spirit being summoned."

      "content": "Ask the spirit a yes-or-no question and wait for the coin to move. Now that a spirit has been called and indicated a presence on your board, question it further by saying something like “Are you here?” Keep repeating this question until the coin moves onto the “YES” space, which may take awhile. Once the coin moves, however, it’s confirmed that the spirit is with you. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Keep asking questions and watch how the coin answers.",
      "content": "Keep asking questions and watch how the coin answers. Ask questions out loud to the spirit and watch as the coin moves to spell out the answer. These answers may be spelled out very quickly—you may want to designate a player whose role is to write down the answers instead of touching the coin. [6] X Research source Remain respectful of the spirits and thank them for talking to you. Don’t automatically believe the board. Spirits are not always going to speak the truth."

      "content": "Some people believe that the Spirit Coin game is derived from Kokkuri-san. Kokkuri-san is a Japanese game similar to the Ouija board that was said to be originally played with sets of round rice containers (today, it’s more often played with coins). To play the original game, participants would stack up three sets of round rice containers. According to some sources, players would then place their hands on the top of the stack and determine the spirits’ answers to their questions based on how the stack would lean. [7] X Research source The leaning of the tower was referred to as kokkuri, kokkuri to katamuku (“Leaning, they’re leaning”). This game is also known by other names, including “Cupid-san,” “Kirakira-sama,” “Angel-sama” and “Guardian Spirit.”"
