      "title": "He’ll be so confused, he won’t even know what to say.",
      "content": "He’ll be so confused, he won’t even know what to say. Give your boyfriend a ring and then say, “Hello?” when he answers. After he asks why you called him, act confused, and say that he called you. After a few minutes, you can tell him that you’re just kidding. You could also throw in something like, “You said you had something serious to talk about?” or, “You’ve been calling me all day!”"

      "title": "Wait until he calls, then say “Who is this?”",
      "content": "Wait until he calls, then say “Who is this?” When he says something like, “It’s Jake, your boyfriend, duh!” you can follow up with something like, “Sorry, I don’t know anyone by that name.” Keep it going for a couple of minutes until you finally break and tell him that it was just a prank. [1] X Research source You might even say something like, “I think you have the wrong number,” or, “Are you sure you’re calling the right person?” just to really sell it."

      "title": "Call him and pretend you’re a local radio station.",
      "content": "Call him and pretend you’re a local radio station. When you dial his number, type *67 before his cell number to hide your own contact info so he can’t tell it’s you. Disguise your voice, then let him know that he’s won a free vacation to Hawaii! After he gets all excited and asks when he gets to go, you can reveal that it’s you and tell him that it was all a prank. [2] X Research source When your BF answers the phone, put on a goofy voice and say something like, “Hello! This is Amanda from Z100, America’s top radio station! I’m excited to tell you that you’ve won our premium vacation package for being such an awesome listener!”"

      "title": "Hide your number and pretend you’re a scorned lover of his.",
      "content": "Hide your number and pretend you’re a scorned lover of his. Call your boyfriend up and tell him that you’re still in love with him, and that you want to run away together. If he asks who it is, say something like, “Who do you think this is??” Then, just say yes to whoever he says. [3] X Research source Bonus points if you can fake cry over the phone!"

      "title": "Tell your boyfriend that he’s under suspicion for murder.",
      "content": "Tell your boyfriend that he’s under suspicion for murder. Hide your number again, and then disguise your voice by making it way deeper or way higher. Tell him that his name came up in an investigation, and that he might need to come in for questioning. When he asks who he murdered, tell him, “a cockroach.” [4] X Research source This one works best if you really build the tension up for a couple of minutes. Since you know your BF, you can tell him that he was spotted on the scene wearing a baseball cap (if he wears a baseball cap all the time). The more details you add in, the better!"

      "content": "This classic prank will get your boyfriend’s heart racing. If you are able to get pregnant and you and your BF are sexually active, call him up and tell him that you just took an at-home pregnancy test. After he freaks out for a few minutes, tell him that you were just kidding, and you’re actually still baby-free. [5] X Research source Be careful with this prank! Pregnancy scares can really make people anxious, so don’t use this one if your boyfriend is already stressed out or worried about other stuff."

      "title": "This prank only works if you two live far away.",
      "content": "This prank only works if you two live far away. Call up your boyfriend and tell him that you’re out of toilet paper and you really need him to bring you some right now! When he reminds you that he’s home (and way too far away to drive you some toilet paper), act annoyed, and tell him that he never does anything for you. [6] X Research source This is particularly funny if you two are in a long distance relationship or you live far enough away from each other that you have to fly back and forth to see each other."

      "title": "Start a normal conversation, then dive into something yucky.",
      "content": "Start a normal conversation, then dive into something yucky. If your BF hates spiders, maybe describe in detail about the creepy-crawlies you saw down in your basement. Or, you could tell him all about your bathroom habits after a Taco Bell run. Topics like these will probably make your boyfriend squirm, even over the phone. Try something like: [7] X Research source “I saw the biggest spider today, I swear it was as big as my hand. It was so hairy, too! It scuttled right past me, and I have no idea where it is now.” “Ugh, I should not have eaten that burrito last night. My gut is rumbling like an earthquake right now! You do not want to know what the toilet looked like this morning.”"

      "content": "He’ll probably get an adrenaline rush and laugh at your funny prank. Try asking something like, “Wanna get dinner tonight?” or, “How’s your day going?” Bonus points if you ask him to call you and then don’t answer right away! [8] X Research source You could also say something like, “I just wanted to hear your voice,” or, “Just wanted to say I love you!”"

      "title": "Prank apps call and “talk” to whoever’s number you put in.",
      "content": "Prank apps call and “talk” to whoever’s number you put in. Download an app like PrankDial, The Prank App, or Who’s Calling Fake Caller and type in your BF’s information. The app will call him and have an automated machine “talk” to him, and even listen to his responses! [9] X Research source Some of these apps have in-app purchases, but most are free to download and use. You could also use a prank website, like Prank Caller, Prank Call Panda, Comedy Calls, or Prank Call Nation."

      "title": "Act like he signed up for a subscription to text him facts every day.",
      "content": "Act like he signed up for a subscription to text him facts every day. When he tries to get the messages to stop, just reply with more facts! This classic prank never gets old, and he’ll probably be amused by the funny facts you send. Use messages like: [10] X Research source “Thanks for subscribing to cat facts! Did you know that all cats have 4 legs? Reply STOP to opt out of cat facts.” “Good morning and welcome to cat facts! Cats use their tails for balance as they walk, run, jump, and climb. To opt out of cat facts, reply with STOP.”"

      "content": "Pick a song you like to confuse your BF via text. Then, send him song lyrics line by line in separate messages so it looks like you’re trying to have a normal conversation. He’ll probably be super confused, but if he knows the song, he’ll figure it out eventually! [11] X Research source For instance, you might use “Break My Stride” by Matthew Wilder. You could send, “Last night, I had the strangest dream/I sailed away to China/In a little rowboat to find ya/And you said you had to get your laundry clean/Didn't want no one to hold you, what does that mean?\""
