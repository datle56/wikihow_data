      "title": "Locate the vertebra at the base of your neck.",
      "content": "Locate the vertebra at the base of your neck. By angling your head downward while standing up straight, you will reveal a bump that marks the top of your torso. You can also find this spot by moving your fingers directly inward from your shoulders to the center of your upper back. This spot on your back is technically known as the C7 vertebra."

    {
      "title": "Find the top of each of your hip bones.",
      "content": "Find the top of each of your hip bones. Called the iliac crests or “love handles,” these will be the bottom of your measurement. Place a thumb on one of these to mark its position. If you are using a mirror, you can visually keep track of where they are. If you have a friend to help, keep your hands on your iliac crests so your friend can measure exactly from the top of your torso to the middle point between the two sides."

      "title": "Measure the distance between the top and bottom points.",
      "content": "Measure the distance between the top and bottom points. On your own, it is easiest to drape the tape over your shoulder and align the top of the tape with the vertebra you found, and then measure down to the thumb resting on top of your hips. [1] X Research source Your friend can simply pull the tape taut between the vertebra and the midpoint between your thumbs to get the measurement. If you do not have a measuring tape, you could also use a piece of string or ribbon."

    {
      "title": "Grasp the tape measure at the exact line of your iliac crests.",
      "content": "Grasp the tape measure at the exact line of your iliac crests. You can check the tape measure for the number at that spot to get a reading of your torso length. [2] X Research source Most adults have a torso length between 15 inches (38 cm) and 22 inches (56 cm). Torso length and height are independent of one another, so someone who is 5 feet (1.5 m) and 6 inches (15 cm) tall may surprise you by having a longer torso than someone who is 5 feet (1.5 m) and 6 inches (15 cm) tall. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Drape a soft measuring tape down your back, starting at your shoulder.",
      "content": "Drape a soft measuring tape down your back, starting at your shoulder. While you are standing up straight , let the full length of the measuring tape reach down your back to your buttocks. The lowest number on the tape should rest on your shoulder. This will be easier with a friend to help you, as they can simply pull the tape around your torso in a single motion, but it is still possible to do on your own. [4] X Research source You can also do this in reverse, beginning at the inside portion of your shoulder on the front of your body."

    {
      "title": "Pull the measuring tape toward your front between your legs.",
      "content": "Pull the measuring tape toward your front between your legs. The tape will be stretching from your shoulder through the groin so that you can make a loop with it. [5] X Research source To do this in reverse, pull the tape toward the back of your body between your legs."
    },
    {
      "title": "Stretch the tape back up the front of your torso.",
      "content": "Stretch the tape back up the front of your torso. The tape should stretch over the bust at the same point you would take a bust measurement, usually the fullest point. If the measuring tape reaches up to your shoulder, you have successfully wrapped the measuring tape into a body loop. In reverse, you will have to pull the tape up your back to reach your shoulder while still holding onto the tape on the front side. This is where the difficulty comes in, and why it may be easier to begin with the tape on the back side of your shoulder."

    {
      "title": "Check the number at the spot where the tape meets the start.",
      "content": "Check the number at the spot where the tape meets the start. This number is the measurement of your torso’s body loop. This number has a very large range of typical values, and there are swimsuits and shapewear made specifically for those with a long torso measurement. [6] X Research source The range is generally considered to be between 50 inches (130 cm) and 80 inches (200 cm)."

      "content": "Use a chart to find your shapewear or swimsuit size . Many brands have their own sizing conventions, so it is a good idea to write down your measurement and go to the website for the brand of clothing you want and compare it to their sizing chart. If your measurement is not listed, look for another brand that may have your size, whether smaller or larger."
