      "title": "Pry open the bottle with the edge of a spoon.",
      "content": "Pry open the bottle with the edge of a spoon. Hold the bottle by the neck with your non-dominant hand so there’s about 1 inch (2.5 cm) between the top of your hand and the cap. Position the edge of a metal spoon underneath the cap and rest the handle against your hand. Push down on the handle to pry the bottle cap off of the bottle. [1] X Research source Be sure to use a spoon that won’t bend or deform when you apply pressure to it."

      "title": "Loosen the cap with your keys until it falls off.",
      "content": "Loosen the cap with your keys until it falls off. Hold the top of the bottle cap securely with the thumb on your non-dominant hand. Use the end of a key, either for your home or your car, and slide it under the edge of the cap. Pull the back of the key up to lift the edges and loosen the cap from the bottle. You may need to lift the edges of the bottle cap in multiple places for it to come off. Work your way around the cap until it’s removed."

    {
      "title": "Position a lighter underneath the cap until it pops off.",
      "content": "Position a lighter underneath the cap until it pops off. Hold the bottle with your non-dominant hand so there’s 1 in (2.5 cm) of space between it and the bottle cap. Hold the bottom edge of a lighter underneath the edge of the cap , and slide your hand up along the bottle neck to hold it in place. Push the lighter down over your hand so it pushes up against the cap and pries it off. [2] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Pop the cap off the bottle using a hammer.",
      "content": "Pop the cap off the bottle using a hammer . Position the back of a claw hammer so it grips underneath the bottle cap. Pull the hammer’s handle down toward you to lift the cap. Once the cap pops off, set the hammer aside and enjoy your drink! [3] X Research source Be careful not to use too much force, or you could break the bottle by accident."

    {
      "title": "Use the edge of a belt buckle to simulate a bottle opener.",
      "content": "Use the edge of a belt buckle to simulate a bottle opener. This works best if you have a belt with a metal buckle or clasp. Undo your belt and remove it so you can easily use it. Place the metal U-shape of the belt buckle under the bottle cap. Pull the buckle backward to bend the cap and open the bottle. Some belt buckles have built-in bottle openers. Check the buckle to see if it has an opener on it."

    {
      "title": "Place the bottle cap against your countertop to knock the cap off.",
      "content": "Place the bottle cap against your countertop to knock the cap off. Set the edge of the bottle cap against your counter and tilt the bottle to a 30-degree angle. Hold the bottle securely in place with your non-dominant hand while you hit the cap with your dominant hand. It may take 2-3 hits to fully remove the cap, but it will come off due to the force. [4] X Research source Be careful not to break the bottle while you hit it. The drink inside the bottle may start to foam up if it’s carbonated. Make sure it doesn’t spill onto anything you can’t easily clean."

      "title": "Pry the bottle cap off with a steel or titanium ring.",
      "content": "Pry the bottle cap off with a steel or titanium ring. Put your hand over the bottle cap so your ring catches the underside of the bottle cap. Tilt the bottle to a 45-degree angle toward your hand so it grips onto the ring. Grip the top of the bottle and tilt your hand back so the ring pries open the bottle. [5] X Research source If your ring starts to dig into your finger before removing the cap, stop so you don’t hurt yourself."

    {
      "title": "Try twisting the cap off with a rubber band or cloth.",
      "content": "Try twisting the cap off with a rubber band or cloth. Wrap a rubber band or cloth around the bottle cap multiple times until you get a good grip on it. Twist the cap counterclockwise to loosen it and see if it comes off. The added leverage from the rubber band may make the cap spin off of the bottle. This may be difficult since many bottle caps are not meant to be twisted off."

      "title": "Use a pair of scissors as a makeshift bottle opener.",
      "content": "Use a pair of scissors as a makeshift bottle opener. Open a pair of scissors halfway so the blades make a V-shape, and place the point where the blades cross under the bottle cap. Push the handles down and slightly squeeze them together to pry open the bottle and pop off the cap. [6] X Research source Alternatively, you could cut along the ridges on the cap until it comes loose from the bottle. Make sure the scissors are pointed away from you so they won’t cut you in case they slip."

      "title": "Turn a screw into the cork and pry it out with a hammer for a makeshift opener.",
      "content": "Turn a screw into the cork and pry it out with a hammer for a makeshift opener . Turn a screw by hand through the center of the cork, and stop so the screw head is 1 ⁄ 2 inch (1.3 cm) above the cork. Use the back of a claw hammer to grip the screw and rock it back and forth to loosen the cork. Try turning the bottle until the cork pops out. [7] X Research source Don’t have a nail and a hammer? Try using a knife or screwdriver. Simply place the tip into the cork gently and pull."

      "title": "Place the bottle in a tennis shoe and hit it against a wall if you don’t have tools.",
      "content": "Place the bottle in a tennis shoe and hit it against a wall if you don’t have tools. Put the bottle into the shoe and hold it tightly against the insole. Hit the heel of the shoe against a hard surface, such as a wall or countertop, to work the cork out from the bottle’s neck. Once you can get a good grip on the cork, pull the rest out by hand. [8] X Research source Don’t use a shoe with high heels or flat soles since you could break the bottle by accident."

      "title": "Push the cork into the wine bottle if you can’t get it out.",
      "content": "Push the cork into the wine bottle if you can’t get it out. Use your fingers to push the cork deeper into the bottle so it falls into the wine. If you can’t push it by hand, use the handle of a long utensil, such as a wooden spoon, to help force it down further. [9] X Research source If the cork breaks apart in the wine, pour the liquid through a strainer into a different container to store it."

      "title": "Use a bike pump to force the cork out of the bottle.",
      "content": "Use a bike pump to force the cork out of the bottle. Make sure your bike pump has a small needle attachment on the end. Push the needle along the side of the neck so it extends past the cork’s bottom. Pump the air slowly and watch the cork to see if it rises out from the neck. Once you can get a grip on it, then pull the cork out by hand. [10] X Research source If you don’t see any progress after a few pumps, take the needle out of the bottle. The pressure could build inside the wine bottle and break it."
