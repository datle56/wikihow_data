      "content": "Hold your EZ curl bar (or barbell) with an underhand grip. In other words, your palms should be facing up. Then, sit on the preacher bench , put your feet flat on the floor, and ensure the seat is properly adjusted so your upper arms and chest are in constant contact with the arm pad. With that, you’re ready to begin! [1] X Research source You can use an EZ curl bar or barbell for this exercise, although EZ bars are recommended. For this exercise, you’ll also need access to a preacher bench (as the name of the exercise suggests)."

      "content": "Tuck your chin close to your chest and hold your arms out. Maintain a slight bend in your elbows, and keep your wrists in a neutral position. This is the correct starting position for a preacher curl. Keep in mind that your chin should be tucked for the entire exercise! [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Lift the EZ bar or barbell level with your shoulders, then lower it.",
      "content": "Lift the EZ bar or barbell level with your shoulders, then lower it. When you begin the upward movement, squeeze your biceps and bend your elbows as you lift, keeping your upper arms in contact with the arm pad. When the weight is level with your shoulders, squeeze your biceps as hard as you can, pause briefly, and then lower it slowly back into the starting position. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Use weights that you can control through the full preacher curl.",
      "content": "Use weights that you can control through the full preacher curl. Don’t try to use the heaviest weights possible with this exercise just to test yourself. Instead, before you do a full workout, make sure you can do a preacher curl without losing control of the EZ bar or barbell while lowering it back down. You should be able to control your body for the entire time! [4] X Research source Additionally, pay attention to your body and its needs. Remember to stop if you notice any pain or discomfort."
    },
    {
      "title": "Keep your movements slow and continuous during each curl.",
      "content": "Keep your movements slow and continuous during each curl. Try not to speed through the lift or let your arms drop too fast; the tension as you slowly lift and lower the weight gives your muscles such a great workout. Take each preacher curl slowly while maintaining the proper stance. [5] X Research source While there should be a slight pause at the top of the exercise (when the weight is level with your shoulders), don’t stop and rest there. Keep the movement going!"

    {
      "title": "Take care of yourself and rest between workouts.",
      "content": "Take care of yourself and rest between workouts. As with any workout regimen, it’s important to eat a balanced diet and get plenty of rest in conjunction with the exercise. Letting your body recover between workouts will help you build up strength faster! Remember to rest 24 to 48 hours before working the same muscle groups (in this case, your biceps). If you have a pre-existing health condition or have had health issues in the past, talk to your doctor before starting an intense workout regimen . They may have advice or guidance for you!"

      "title": "Preacher curls strengthen muscles and allow more movement control.",
      "content": "Preacher curls strengthen muscles and allow more movement control. Because the preacher bench is there for you to sit and rest your upper arms on, you’ll have more control over your movements while doing each curl. In turn, that means you do the negative component of the exercise (when you lower the weight) more slowly, leading to increased muscle growth. [6] X Research source The preacher bench and arm pad also keep you stable, so you won’t be tempted to swing your back or arms when lifting the bar (which can happen when you’re standing). Swinging means you’re using momentum to lift rather than your muscles, so you aren’t getting as much out of the exercise—and there’s a greater risk of injury. Assuming you use an EZ bar (usually the recommended weight for this exercise), its zig-zag shape is designed to take some strain off your wrists. Finally, if you want to work your biceps, preacher curls are the perfect exercise, as they specifically isolate and target your bicep muscles."

      "title": "Preacher curls mainly work the biceps brachii (also called biceps).",
      "content": "Preacher curls mainly work the biceps brachii (also called biceps). The biceps brachii have two “heads,” or insertion points, that connect to the scapula (your shoulder blades). Preacher curls activate both heads of your biceps brachii—resulting in a more muscular appearance. Preacher curls also target the brachialis and brachioradialis, both elbow flexor muscles. [7] X Research source In short, preacher curls effectively target your biceps, building both strength and muscle mass there!"
    },
    {
      "title": "Preacher curls target more specific muscles.",
      "content": "Preacher curls target more specific muscles. They isolate and work out your upper arms (especially muscles like the biceps and brachialis). Barbell curls, on the other hand, work out your full body. Because you’re standing while lifting a barbell, you’re activating your glutes, core, and upper body muscles. Naturally, barbell curls and preacher curls also utilize different equipment. Barbell curls just require a barbell, while preacher curls require a preacher bench and EZ bar."
    },
    {
      "title": "Preacher curls have a different range of motion.",
      "content": "Preacher curls have a different range of motion. Because of the posture required and how they stretch out the large head in your biceps brachii, preacher curls allow for a greater range of movement than standard barbell curls. However, barbell curls allow you to lift more weight because they have a shorter range of motion. Lighter weights are usually needed for the controlled movements of a preacher curl."

    {
      "title": "Dumbbell preacher curl",
      "content": "Dumbbell preacher curl Dumbbell preacher curls work almost exactly the same as standard preacher curls; the only difference is that they involve lifting a dumbbell in each hand rather than an EZ bar or barbell. This can improve your unilateral strength and help you find (and correct) any strength imbalances between your arms."

    {
      "title": "Close grip preacher curl",
      "content": "Close grip preacher curl With this variant, keep your hands close on the EZ curl bar (or barbell, if you prefer). The usual wide grip works your inner biceps, while a close grip focuses more on your outer biceps by shifting tension to the muscle fibers there. Aside from the changed grip, do each preacher curl as described above!"

    {
      "title": "Dumbbell hammer preacher curl",
      "content": "Dumbbell hammer preacher curl To do a dumbbell hammer preacher curl, hold a dumbbell in each hand and keep your wrists in a neutral position (with your thumbs facing up and your pinky facing the ground) throughout the entire movement. Lift the dumbbells until they’re level with your shoulders, then lower them, just like the standard preacher curl. Maintaining a hammer grip on your dumbbells does more work on your brachioradialis and brachialis than your biceps (essentially helping develop your upper arms)."

    {
      "title": "Reverse preacher curl",
      "content": "Reverse preacher curl A reverse preacher curl simply means holding the EZ bar or barbell with an overhand grip (so your palms are facing down) as you do the exercise. This targets your forearm extensors, leading to better forearm strength and healthier elbows (since it’ll create more balance between your flexors and extensors). [8] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Single-arm preacher curl",
      "content": "Single-arm preacher curl If you notice any strength imbalances between your arms, you can do single-arm preacher curls to correct them! Single-arm preacher curls involve holding a single dumbbell in one hand and completing the standard preacher curl movement described above, meaning you’re only working one arm at a time.
