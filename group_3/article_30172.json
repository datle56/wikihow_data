      "content": "Decide what mobs you want in your zoo. These can include cows, pigs, chickens, and other peaceful mobs, as well as hostile mobs. You'll need to have an idea before building the zoo, so that you know what sorts of structures are needed to contain them well."

      "title": "Build the base.",
      "content": "Build the base. A suggestion to do would be creating a 10 block by 10 block square for each mob's pen. Avoid counting any wall space. After all of the pens are done, you could put little stands next to each pen with villagers."

      "content": "Decorate the inside of each enclosure. For cows, you could put a plains area with a tree or two and some tall grass and flowers. For zombies or skeletons, you could make a cave and have water outside, so they don't burn."

      "title": "Build the walls.",
      "content": "Build the walls. You can make them out of any material, but it's preferably at least one row of glass so visitors can see. For hostile mobs, you have to make a roof or covered area inside."
