If you got anything other than fresh water on the phone (such as chlorinated water, saltwater, or other liquids), rinse the phone with tap water before drying it off . Don’t insert anything into the ports on your phone to dry them, such as a cotton swab or paper towel. Doing so could do more harm than good."

To help it along, try placing the phone in front of a fan with the charging port facing the air flow. [6] X Research source Many guides will report that placing your iPhone in a bag of rice will help draw the water out. This has been proven false --simply letting your iPhone air dry is the most effective way to fix it.
