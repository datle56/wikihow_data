      "content": "Use R4R if you want to make a connection with another Redditor. Start by creating an R4R ad, which is a post in an R4R subreddit that lets others know you’re looking to meet new people. If you’re just looking for friends, create an R4R ad that talks about your interests, hobbies, and why you’re looking for friends. If you’re looking for a romantic connection, create an R4R ad that talks about your preferences, romantic interests, and what you’re looking for in a partner. Add an NSFW tag in your romantic R4R ad to let users know that you’re looking for a partner. To connect with people around you, look to see if there is a specific R4R subreddit for your town or city. Although R4R subreddits are often NSFW, some people are just looking for friends. To avoid making others uncomfortable, read the tags and post content to make sure you’re looking for the same thing as them. Be careful when meeting strangers online. To stay safe when meeting other Redditors, meet them at public places around other people."

To ask others to do R4R without commenting, use the #r4r hashtag on your post."
