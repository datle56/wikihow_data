      "content": "In Paranoia, a person asks a fun question about someone without them knowing. For this party game, one player starts by whispering a “Who” question to the person next to them, like “Who’s the most likely to eat the last slice of pizza?” Then, the other person answers the question with a name of someone in the group. The person who was named can either give into the paranoia and learn the question by drinking or resist and move on. [1] X Research source Paranoia is a great game to play at a pregame, which is when you gather with friends for drinks before a main event, like a bar or sporting event. The questions for Paranoia aren’t too serious. Instead, they’re amusing, fun, and playful. The game is called Paranoia because it plays on our natural urge to find out what people think of us. Judgement can make you scared, paranoid even."

Gather them around a table or in a circle and have your drinks on hand. It’s best to play with shots or cocktails, but beer, cider, and other sippers work just as well.

      "content": "Whisper a “who” question to the person on your right. Start off with a fun, light question then work your way up to more exciting questions. For example, it’d be best to start with something like “Who here is the most likely to be late for work after a night out?” before asking “Who here is most likely to be fired from their job for showing up drunk from the night before?” [3] X Research source If you’re comfortable with your group, skip breaking the ice to speed things up."

For example, answer “Oscar” to the group if you think your friend Oscar is the most likely to be late for work after a night out, but make sure you don’t say the question. [4] X Research source"

They can either drink to find out the question or they can move on by asking the person to their right a new question. [5] X Research source To drink for the question, take a shot or a five-second drink from a beer, cider, cocktail, or another drink of choice."

Questions in Paranoia are a great opportunity to learn what everyone thinks of each other, so asking fun, exciting questions is crucial! Here’s a list of questions to choose from: Who here has the worst job? Who here is most likely to black out tonight? Who’s gonna be the first one to leave tonight? Who in this room is basically a celebrity? Who here is the most likely to be TikTok famous? Who here would cheat on their partner? Who is the fakest person in the room? Out of everyone, who keeps it real the most? Who is the worst in bed? Who cooks the best food? Who is the one always getting into shenanigans during a night out? Who’s the most likely to go home with a random at the end of the night? If you were in a fight and needed backup, who would you call? Who’s the most likely to ditch you in a haunted house? Who would you call to bail you out of a police station? Who is most likely to wake up in a random place?"
