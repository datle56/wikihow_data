      "title": "Joyeux anniversaire!",
      "content": "Joyeux anniversaire! This translates directly to “Happy birthday!” in French. It’s the first of two standard “happy birthday” greetings used commonly in France. While you can also use this saying in Quebec and other French-speaking parts of Canada, note that it’s not the most common way to offer birthday wishes there. [1] X Research source Pronunciation : Zhwa-yeu zah-ni-vehr-sehr Joyeux means \"happy,\" \"joyful,\" or \"gleeful.\" Anniversaire can mean \"birthday\" or \"anniversary,\" but when said alone, it most commonly refers to one's birthday. To refer to a wedding anniversary, you would say \"anniversaire de mariage.\""

      "title": "Bon anniversaire!",
      "content": "Bon anniversaire! This is the second of two standard “happy birthday” greetings used in France. Bon means \"good\" or \"well\" in French. As such, this phrase translates more directly to \"Have a good birthday\" rather than \"Happy birthday.\" [2] X Research source Pronunciation : Buhn ah-ni-vehr-sehr “Bon anniversaire” uses the male version of “good” (“bon”) because it’s followed by a vowel (“ a nniversaire”), but it’s actually pronounced as bonne. So while “happy birthday” in French is pronounced like “bonne anniversaire,” it’s spelled as “bon anniversaire.” As with Joyeux anniversaire, Bon anniversaire can be used in French-speaking parts of Canada, but it’s not the most common birthday greeting there."

    {
      "title": "Bonne fête!",
      "content": "Bonne fête! This is the most casual and commonly used way to say “Happy birthday” in French-speaking portions of Canada, like Quebec. Unlike the previous two expressions, \"Bonne fête\" can’t be used in France. There, \"Bonne fête\" is usually used to wish someone a good \"name day,” which refers to the feast day of the saint they’re named after. [3] X Research source Pronunciation : Buhn feht Bonne is the feminine form of the word \"bon\", meaning \"good\" or \"well.\" Fête means \"celebration.\" Translated directly, \"Bonne fête\" means \"Good party.\""

    {
      "title": "Joyeux anniversaire en retard!",
      "content": "Joyeux anniversaire en retard! This means “Happy belated birthday!” Use it if you forgot to wish someone a happy birthday on their actual birthday, or missed their birthday for some other reason. “Joyeux anniversaire” is the standard phrase, and “en retard” at the end simply means belated or late in French. [4] X Research source Pronunciation : Zhwa-yeu zah-ni-vehr-sehr ehn ruh-tarh"

    {
      "title": "Passez une merveilleuse journée",
      "content": "Passez une merveilleuse journée In English, this means, “Have a wonderful day!” Passez is a conjugated form of the French verb \"passer,\" meaning \"pass\" or \"spend.\" Merveilleuse translates into \"wonderful,\" and une journée means \"a day.\" Use this phrase to wish someone a happy, satisfying special day. [5] X Research source Pronunciation : Pah-say oon mehr-vay-euze zhour-nay Alternatively, you could use “Passez un bon anniversaire!” to say “Have a good birthday!” instead."

    {
      "title": "Meilleurs vœux",
      "content": "Meilleurs vœux This means “Best wishes!” Use this phrase to warmly wish someone well on their birthday. While it isn’t an especially common birthday greeting in France, it’s still acceptable to use. Meilleurs translates into \"best,\" and vœux translates into \"wishes\" or \"greetings.\" [6] X Research source Pronunciation : May-yeur veu"

      "title": "Félicitations",
      "content": "Félicitations This translates directly to “Congratulations!” in English. Use the greeting to congratulate someone on celebrating their birthday. While this isn’t an especially common way to wish someone a happy birthday, it’s slightly more common to say “Congratulations” in France than in the United States.

    {
      "title": "Merci d'être né(e)",
      "content": "Merci d'être né(e) This translates to “Thanks for being born!” It’s a silly, friendly way to let someone close to you know how much you appreciate them on their birthday. “Né” is the masculine form of the word (for men), while “Née” is the feminine form (for women). [8] X Research source Pronunciation : Mehr-see det-ruh ney “Merci” means “thank you,” while “d'être” means “reason for being” and “né” means “born.”"

      "content": "Joyeux anniversaire, mon amour This means “Happy birthday, my love.” You can be more specific with your “Happy birthday” wishes if you’re talking to someone special! Whether it’s a partner, parent, sibling, friend, or other family member, add a reference to them after the initial “Happy birthday” statement. [9] X Research source Pronunciation : Zhwa-yeu zah-ni-vehr-sehr, mohn ah-moor Terms for friends and family include: Mon frère = My brother Ma sœur = My sister Maman = Mother Papa = Father Mémé = Grandma Pépé = Grandpa Mon ami(e) = My friend Mon beau/Ma belle = My beautiful Ma chérie / Mon chéri = My dear Mon cœur = My heart"

      "title": "Quel âge as-tu?",
      "content": "Quel âge as-tu? This means “How old are you?” in French—but it translates more directly to, “How many years do you have?” since “as” (or “avez” in the formal version of the phrase) is a form of the verb “avoir,” which means “to have.” Use the question to ask someone how old they are on their birthday. [10] X Research source Pronunciation : Kel ahj ah-too “Quel âge avez-vous?” is the more formal version of this phrase, although it means the same thing. Quel means \"what\" or \"which,” and \"âge\" means \"age\" in English. Just remember to use this with people you know well, and have already wished a happy birthday. It’s not considered outright rude in France—but, after all, you wouldn’t ask a stranger how old they are in English."

    {
      "title": "Je vous souhaite plein de bonheur en cette journée spéciale",
      "content": "Je vous souhaite plein de bonheur en cette journée spéciale This translates to \"Wishing you every happiness on your special day,\" or \"I wish you lots of happiness on this special day.\" It’s another way to kindly wish someone a happy birthday without using the same phrase every time. [11] X Research source Pronunciation : Zhe voo zou-hette plehn duh buhn-ehr ehn set zhour-nay speh-cee-ahl Je means \"I\" and vous is a direct object pronoun used to refer to \"you.\" Souhaite means \"wish,\" plein means \"full,\" de means \"of,\" and bonheur means \"happiness.\" En means \"on,\" cette means \"this,\" journée means \"day,\" and spéciale means \"special.\" There are plenty of similar variations as well, such as: Je te souhaite un super anniversaire! (I wish you a great birthday!) Je te souhaite un très joyeux anniversaire! (Wishing you a very happy birthday!) Joyeux anniversaire, passe une belle journée! (Happy birthday, have a good one!)"

      "title": "Que vous puissiez être heureux encore de nombreuses années",
      "content": "Que vous puissiez être heureux encore de nombreuses années This roughly translates to \"May you be happy for many more years,\" or \"Many happy returns.\" You’re essentially wishing someone many more happy birthdays in the future! If the person you’re talking to is female, use “heureuse” instead of “heureux.” [12] X Research source Pronunciation : Keh voo pwee-see-eh zetrah uhr-eu ehn-cor dey nohm-brhus ah-nay Que here means \"may,\" vous means \"you,\" puissiez means \"(to) be able,\" être means \"(to) be,\" and heureux (-se) means \"happy.\" Encore means \"still\" or \"yet\" and expresses the \"still to come\" part of this sentiment. Nombreuses means \"many\" and années means \"years.\" Similar variant phrases include: Que cette nouvelle année t’apporte plein de bonheur! (May this new year bring you lots of happiness!)
