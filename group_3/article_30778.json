      "content": "The theory states if you’re meant to be with someone, you'll meet again. The most common interpretation of the theory (which is also sometimes called the “We Meet People Twice” theory) is that if you meet someone more than once, it’s life’s way of pushing you together and giving you a second chance to fall in love. For instance, maybe you accidentally bump into a stranger at a grocery store and part ways, thinking nothing of it. Then, a year later, you match with the person on Bumble and fall in love. Swoon! The \"Meeting Someone Twice\" theory is usually applied to romantic relationships, but it could apply to any significant relationship in your life, like friends or mentors. TikTokers have shared videos explaining how they briefly met someone and didn’t think much of the interaction or lost contact, only to unexpectedly meet again down the road and fall in love (like in this post by creator @desskeyser from May 2024). Others have shared videos explaining how waiting to meet their true love a second time was well worth the wait (like this TikTok from creator @chelseacamilla in October 2024)."

      "content": "It's often interpreted to mean love will find a way to bring people together. The most popular interpretation of the theory is that if you're really meant to be with someone, fate, the universe, or the spirit of love itself will ensure you cross one another's path again. It may also mean that when you're with someone important, you may be able to look back on your lives before you got together and see evidence that you were always meant to be involved. The theory is reminiscent of the popular German expression, “You always meet twice in life,” which is often used as a goodbye and may be loosely translated as “We’ll meet again.” [1] X Research source"

      "content": "It could be a reminder to treat people well, because you may meet again. The German saying “You always meet twice in life” may also be used as a karmic threat to remind people to be kind to others. Even if they’re strangers you assume you’ll never encounter again, you never know for sure: they may show up later in life. [2] X Research source It could also be a reminder not to burn bridges with anyone in your life if you can help it, since you may encounter one another again."

      "content": "It may mean that everyone you meet, you “meet” again in someone else. One viral TikTok interprets the theory to mean that even after you part ways with someone, you may later meet someone who embodies similar traits or makes you feel the same way. This could be someone you’ve had a relationship with or someone you’ve simply known as a friend."

      "content": "The theory seems to have cropped up on TikTok. The exact origins of the theory are unclear, but it seems to have sprouted from TikTokers sharing anecdotes about how the theory has worked in their own love lives. The theory gained traction with users who resonate with the idea of losing touch with someone or briefly meeting them, only to find themselves involved in a meaningful relationship down the road, as this TikTok from user @catemerald explains. The process of meeting significant people twice is somewhat reflective of natural psychological patterns: while the first encounter you have with someone is usually pretty superficial, the second meeting may foster a deeper mutual understanding, as both you and they are probably more comfortable with one another."

      "content": "The theory has no scientific basis, but many people claim it’s true. Stories abound on the internet of the veracity of the “Meeting Someone Twice” theory, but there’s no scientific evidence it actually holds water. The skeptic’s response might be that in order for any relationship to work, you’d have to meet somebody at least twice, but many would argue this is a poor-faith reading of the theory. In any case, studies show that many people find the idea of fate comforting, especially the notion of “fate control,” which posits that we are bound by destiny but that we still have agency to shape our future or negotiate with fate. [3] X Research source The “Meet Someone Twice” theory could reinforce the notion of fate control, since the theory holds that the universe pushes you together with someone, but of course, it’s the two of you who must make the choice to be together."

      "content": "The theory could be an example of the Baader-Meinhof Phenomenon. While many TikTokers claim the \"Meeting Someone Twice\" theory is true, it's possible they've just experienced the Baader-Meinhof Phenomenon, a.k.a. the frequency illusion. This phenomenon, which relies on cognitive bias, suggests that once you notice something, you begin to notice it everywhere. [4] X Research source For example, you hear the word \"splendiferous\" once, and suddenly it seems like you're seeing it everywhere. You might wonder, Why is everyone saying \"splendiferous\" all of a sudden? But the truth is our brains tend to \"see\" what they're thinking about and attribute meaning to everyday patterns, even when there's no (apparent) meaning. So if you fall in love with someone you've met twice, it may feel preordained, but in reality, it could just be that your brain has recognized a pattern, and we're prone to put special emphasis on patterns. After all, think of all the people you've met twice and didn't have a special connection with. (Then again... maybe you will eventually!)"

The idea is that if they agree, they’re a loving and caring partner, but if they refuse, they’re not right for you."

      "content": "Invisible string theory Similar to the red string of fate theory, the invisible string theory suggests that your soulmate or life partner is always connected to your past, even before you meet them. For instance, maybe you and your spouse discover you had the same babysitter growing up, but you never met one another until adulthood."

      "content": "Olive theory The olive theory , invented and popularized by the sitcom How I Met Your Mother , has been interpreted in two ways. It is popularly interpreted to mean that in any compatible relationship, one person loves olives—a somewhat polarizing food—and the other person hates them. However, in the TV show, the “real” message of the olive theory is that healthy relationships involve compromise and sacrifice, exemplified by one character in the series pretending to dislike olives so that his fiancée can eat them all."
