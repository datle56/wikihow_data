Simply place your hand on the bottom rail. Then, either pull down or push up gently. The blinds will follow suit. [1] X Research source If your blinds are installed hanging from the top of your window, the rail should be at the base of your slats or shade. If your blinds are installed at the bottom of your window, the rail should be at the top of your slats or shade. If you are having trouble lowering your blinds with the rail, contact the company that installed them or your local window treatment store to get an inspection. If your cordless blinds are motorized, simply use their remote or an app to control them. This will be specified when the blinds are installed."

      "content": "When the blinds won’t go up If your cordless blinds won’t open, chances are it’s because the spring mechanism inside is locked in place. Remove the blinds, then look along the top or bottom of the blinds for a pin. Turn the pin clockwise to increase the tension. Remount the blinds once they’re adjusted. [3] X Research source The pin is usually located where the tension mechanism is on the top or bottom of the blinds, in the headrail or bottom rail. [4] X Research source You may need pliers to reach and turn the pin."

Remove the blinds and check for kinks in the strings or broken pieces.

      "title": "Why do your blinds not have strings?",
      "content": "Why do your blinds not have strings? Your blinds likely don’t have strings because they’re cordless. This means that the blinds move up and down by pulling or pushing on the bottom of the blind, not yanking a cord."

      "title": "How do cordless blinds work?",
      "content": "How do cordless blinds work? Cordless blinds raise and lower without needing to pull a visible string. This style of blind has a tension mechanism insider the headrail or bottom rail. When pushed or pulled, strings move along the mechanism to increase or decrease tension, allowing the blinds to stay up or down. [7] X Research source"
