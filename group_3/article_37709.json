      "content": "Roblox error code 277 indicates an Internet connection issue. When the Roblox game cannot establish a connection to a network, the player will receive the “Error Code 277” message and be unable to join a game server. This issue typically happens on PC devices, but it may also appear through Roblox on mobile, Xbox, and PlayStation (i.e., PS4). [1] X Research source While Roblox error code 277 is an Internet connection error, that doesn’t mean that it’s the player’s home internet that’s causing the issue. While there’s no singular definitive reason for error code 277, common causes include Roblox server outages, unstable Internet connections, corrupt DNS caches, and un-updated Roblox applications. In the section below, we’ll walk through the top fixes that will address any of these issues and resolve Roblox error code 277 in no time."

      "title": "Check the status of the Roblox servers.",
      "content": "Check the status of the Roblox servers. Roblox is a pretty popular game, so its server can sometimes be overloaded and crash, which may result in error code 277. To check the Roblox server status, go to the Roblox Status page and look for the All Systems Operational message. If you don’t see that message (which usually appears in a green box at the top of the page), the Roblox servers are down. You’ll have to wait some time for the servers to come back up before resuming play.

      "content": "Restart your internet or WiFi. One of the most common causes of Roblox error code 277 is a poor internet connection on your personal device. To resolve this problem, turn off your Internet router and let it sit for a few seconds. Then, turn the router back on and wait for it to stabilize (usually 3-5 minutes). If your internet connection was the issue, the Roblox error code 277 should now disappear. [3] X Research source If you want to check if your WiFi is the issue, open a new window on your device and try to stream a show or play a different game that requires an internet connection. If it doesn’t work, then your personal network is likely the issue. If you’re able to, you could also try switching to a different network, like your mobile data, a hotspot, or a different WiFi server in your home.

Your DNS cache holds all of the temporarily stored data on your device, like the names of domains and databases you’ve connected to in the past (including Roblox!).

[7] X Research source To flush your DNS in Windows , open the Start menu and search for cmd . Open Command Prompt and type ipconfig /flushdns into it. Press enter and wait to receive a confirmation message. Return to Roblox—if DNS was the issue, the error code should be gone. To flush your DNS on a Mac , open Spotlight and launch the Terminal app . Depending on your current operating system, select one of the commands below and copy and paste it into Terminal. Press enter, then enter your password and press Enter again. Return to Roblox to see if the issue has been resolved. macOS El Capitan (macOS 10.11) and newer: sudo dscacheutil -flushcache; sudo killall -HUP mDNSResponder macOS 10.7-10.10 (Lion, Mountain Lion, and Mavericks): sudo killall -HUP mDNSResponder macOS 10.5-10.6 (Leopard, Snow Leopard): sudo dscacheutil –flushcache macOS 10.4 Tiger: lookupd -flushcache This solution is mainly directed at PCs rather than mobile devices or gaming systems."
