The watch is made from stainless steel and includes 20 different complications, including gorgeous chimes that can be preprogrammed to ring at a specific time and date. It also boasts a double-face case that you can turn around to reveal a 2nd style of watch. [2] X Research source In watchmaking, a complication refers to any feature that goes beyond displaying hours, minutes, and seconds. [3] X Research source Common watch complications include having a date window, calendars, a chronograph (or stopwatch), a moon phase display, or a power reserve indicator. Many luxury watches also feature a complication called a tourbillon, meaning “whirlwind” in French. A tourbillon is when a watch’s timekeeping parts (like the balance wheel and escapement) spin in a visible rotating cage. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Jaeger-LeCoultre Joaillerie 101 Manchette ($26 million) The Joaillerie 101 Manchette was created for Queen Elizabeth II. Like other top watches on the list, it includes polished diamonds on a white gold setting. The watch operates on a manual winding 101 caliber movement and stands out because of its geometric pattern design and super small watch face, which makes it feel more like an incredibly expensive bracelet than a watch. A watch’s movement is the internal mechanism responsible for making the watch run. Mechanical and automatic movements are made up of mechanical parts, while a quartz movement usually requires a battery to run. [6] X Research source Jewelry and watch designer Bill Green notes that “when you're winding a watch in a clockwise direction, it's doing all of its work. It's like riding a bicycle. When you ride a bicycle and you pedal forward, it's propelling you forward. When you pedal backward, it's really not doing any work. When you're winding, you can simply grasp it back and forth, and you're fine. With an automatic watch, you will not come to a stop because there is a slip clutch mechanism that allows the mainspring to slip.”"

Included among the gems are 874 diamonds, including a 15-carat heart-shaped pink diamond, a nearly 13-carat blue diamond, and an 11-carat D-colored diamond.

The majority of wristwatches are made with stainless steel, while platinum is considered the top watch material available. [19] X Research source While white gold is an alloy of gold, platinum is a pure white metal known for its durability and scratch resistance.

When top brands charge more, they’re selling you a watch and their well-known reputations in the watch world. Limited inventory can also affect the price of a watch, either from its exclusivity or rarity; many watch companies can’t keep up with consumer demand, which makes certain models “must-haves.” Also, watch prices can go up when they’re re-sold since they’ve become more sought-after or rare. Certified image consultant Tavia Sharp emphasizes that buying a watch “depends on your overall personal style. Are you more classic, or would you go with something a little bit more like luxury or high-end because it's going to communicate something? It’s communicating different things depending on what type of watch you invest in. Also, a watch is something that will last a long time; if you invest in a high-quality watch, it's something that you can keep for a very long time.”"
