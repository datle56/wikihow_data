      "content": "Say the score before each serve, starting with your total points. When playing badminton, both teams start with 0 points apiece. Before you serve the shuttlecock, announce the score of the game. To phrase the score, call out your total number of points, followed by your opponent's total number of points. For example, when starting the game, say \"zero to zero.\" [1] X Research source Your opponent will say their own score first, followed by yours, when it is their turn to serve."

      "content": "Serve from the right-hand service court if you have an even number of points. Sometimes the right side of the court is called the “even service court” because of this rule. If your total points are 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, or 10, for instance, move to the right side of the court to serve the shuttlecock. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Go to the left service court to serve when your score is an odd number. It's important to keep track of your points so you know which service court to serve from. If you have an odd-numbered score, such as 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9, stand on the left side of the court when you serve. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Get 1 point each time you win a rally. A rally is when you and your opponent hit the shuttlecock back and forth across the net until someone misses and it lands on the ground. After you serve the shuttlecock, your opponent attempts to hit it back over the net to you. If they miss and the shuttlecock lands in the court, you win the rally and score 1 point.

      "content": "Move to the other service court after you win a point. For both singles and doubles games, you must swap service courts when you win a rally. If you have a partner, trade places. [5] X Research source For instance, say you started with 3 points and served from the left service court. If you win the rally, you now have 4 points and will serve from the right service court."

If you served the first round and won the first rally, continue serving until the other player wins a turn. [6] X Research source If you're playing doubles and your partner won the rally, they get to serve. If your opponent won the rally, they get to serve."

Fouls include serving the shuttlecock outside of the court, contacting the net with your body or racket, extending your racket past the net, or hitting the shuttlecock multiple times.
