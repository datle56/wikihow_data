      "content": "To sell tokens for your region's local currency, you'll need to use a service that supports withdrawals to a bank account. Such services are referred to as \"offramps\" in the crypto world, as they allow you to convert cryptocurrency into fiat (your local government's currency). Trust Wallet has lots of features for swapping cryptocurrencies for one another, but no option to withdraw directly into your bank account."

      "title": "There are two primary types of off-ramps.",
      "content": "There are two primary types of off-ramps. One is a centralized cryptocurrency exchange, and another is a peer-to-peer transaction. The easiest way to get money from Trust Wallet into your bank account is to use a well-known centralized cryptocurrency exchange that supports sales, conversions, and withdrawals. Once you send your tokens to the exchange, you can sell them for your local currency, and withdraw the funds to your bank. Peer-to-peer transactions are like selling goods online—you'll be selling tokens to another human who will send you your preferred currency in return. But like selling items to strangers, peer-to-peer sales are risky unless you know and trust the buyer. Using a peer-to-peer service like LocalBitcoins can slightly reduce the risk, but only if you chose a payment method that can't be reversed. We'll focus on cryptocurrency exchanges in this article, as they're the safest route."

      "content": "You'll need to find a centralized exchange that supports your local currency and the token you want to sell. To see which exchanges fit the bill, visit https://www.coingecko.com and look up that token. Select the Markets tab to view a list of all supported exchanges, and check the \"Pair\" column for a trading pair that includes your region's local currency. For example, if you want to sell BNB for US dollars (USD), you'll need an exchange that includes the \"BNB/USD\" trading pair. Some tokens aren't easy to swap with USD and other currencies. But don't worry—if you have an obscure meme coin like Safemoon, you can swap it in Trust Wallet for BNB, which is supported by most major exchanges. Once converted to a more common currency, you can send it to a centralized exchange, sell it there, and then withdraw the funds."

Depending on the exchange, you may need to select the token you want to receive first. Tap the Copy option to copy the address to your clipboard. Keep in mind that your exchange wallet contains multiple deposit addresses, and you will need to copy the address for the correct token. For example, if you want to sell your ETH for cash, you'll need your ETH deposit address—not your Bitcoin or BNB address. Depending on the token, you may need to choose a network before you can copy your wallet address. For example, there are two types of BNB in Trust Wallet—Binance Beacon Chain (BEP-2), and Binance Smart Chain (BEP-20). If you're sending the BNB that's on Binance Smart Chain to the exchange, you'd need to select the Binance Smart Chain network to get the correct deposit address.
