      "content": "Get the supplies. Just paper and a pencil, preferably with a rubber/eraser. You could also get some pennies to use as markers for your character. Much simpler than drawing and erasing your character every time you want to move."

      "title": "Create a character.",
      "content": "Create a character. Pick a name for your character and write it down. Also pick a class; Warrior, Wizard, or Archer. Warriors have to attack when they're right on the enemy and they start with 5 attack Wizards and Archers can attack from afar. Next, write down the HP (which starts off at 30), Attack, and Defense. When you start off they're both 30(except if you're a Warrior you get 40). Wizards start with 30 Mana points to cast spells with. Mana replenishes by 10 every 3 turns."

      "title": "Gather friends and play.",
      "content": "Gather friends and play. Have a small 4x3 grid that has numbers 1-12. This will be the Random Number Generator. When it's your turn take the pencil and hold it above about half an inch from the RNG. Drop it and without removing your hand, look at what number you've gotten. This is how many squares you can move through. To attack while a Warrior, move onto the monster and get a random number to add your attack and subtract it from their health. Then 'roll' another number add its attack and that's how much damage you get from the monster. Then keep going back and forth. When a Wizard or Archer attacks, get within 12 spaces between you and the enemy. Then roll and if you get enough spaces to where you could get on them, then you hit. Archers add their range # to that number. Next of course, roll for the attack. After that, roll for the monster, and it goes after you the number of spaces you rolled."

      "title": "Level up.",
      "content": "Level up. To get experience points, defeat a monster and the number of its HP is how much you get. To level up, get enough EXP. to equal the number of your HP. Once you do, distribute 5 points to your HP, Attack, Movement, Range, or Mana. If you have points in your stats add them to your roll. Archers are the only ones who can add to the range, wizards are the only ones for mana."
