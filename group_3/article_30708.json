      "content": "Stand up. To measure correctly for a knee brace, you should be in your normal standing position. This allows the knee and leg to be easily measured and it gives an accurate reading. When standing, your leg is not normally totally straight. Your knee should have a small bend that is about 30 degrees. If you have an injury that doesn't allow you to put pressure on your leg, simply extend it as much as you can. Then take your measurements without the foot touching the ground."

      "content": "Measure the distance around the injured knee. Locate the center of the knee cap. Have your helper place the end of the measuring tape on that point and then wrap the tape around your knee until it comes back to rest on the end of the tape. Read the measurement at the point where the tape meets. Write down your measurements as you go."

    {
      "title": "Measure above and below your knee.",
      "content": "Measure above and below your knee. Identify which spot is the most painful and mark that with a felt marker. Many knee braces require a measurement of your leg above and below this point. To do this, have your helper measure up 6 inches (15 cm) from the injured area and mark that spot with your finger or a washable felt pen. Then have your helper measure around your leg at the spot you have marked. [2] X Research source Repeat this process below your knee as well. The distance you need to go from the knee cap varies by brace, so check with the manufacturer's website to figure out what exact measurements are required. Having an upper and lower measurement will ensure that the support pieces of the brace you pick fit around your thigh and calf."

    {
      "title": "Keep the measuring tape tight and level.",
      "content": "Keep the measuring tape tight and level. Don't let the measuring tape sag or get twisted while you have it wrapped around the knee. This can impact that measurements that you get.

Your knee measurements can help you find the right size. Find your measurements on the chart and move across the chart to identify your size.

      "title": "Pick a larger size if your measurements fall between 2 sizes.",
      "content": "Pick a larger size if your measurements fall between 2 sizes. Sometimes with your specific measurements, a sizing chart says you could pick between 2 sizes. It's almost always a good idea to pick the larger of the 2 options, as knee braces that are on the large side can be strapped down but knee braces that are too small may not even fit at all or they may cut off circulation. This is especially important if you have large thighs or calves, as the larger brace will likely fit your whole leg better."
