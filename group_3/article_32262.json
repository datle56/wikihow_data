      "content": "Protect the walls with plastic sheets. You can buy plastic sheeting at any home improvement store like Lowe’s or Home Depot. Make sure you buy enough to protect the whole area. Use thumbtacks or a hammer and nails to hang the sheeting up on the walls. Use masking tape to secure the bottom of the sheet to the floor. This will prevent the sheets from billowing out and allowing paint to stain the wall."

      "content": "Set up additional lighting. It’s important that you can see what you’re doing, so place extra lights in the area where you’ll be working. Floor lamps would work well, but you can place side table lamps or desk lamps on a flat, elevated surface, as well. You can also increase the brightness in the room by adding reflective materials such as aluminum sheets or mirrors on the walls."

      "content": "Remove and set aside the parts of the bike you plan to paint. This article will use the tank as an example, but the same basic method should be applied to all bike pieces. The tank is a great place to start if you’re new to painting motorcycles because it’s fairly easy to remove and has broad, flat surfaces that are easy to work with. Check which size allen wrench you need to remove the bolts holding the tank in place. Remove all the bolts holding it in place and lift the tank off the frame. Set it aside. Store the bolts in a plastic baggie clearly marked as “tank bolts.”"

      "content": "Sand down the surface you wish to paint. [2] X Research source This part will take some time and elbow grease, but it’s an important step. If the surface you’re painting isn’t perfectly smooth, you’ll end up with an ugly, uneven coat of paint on your bike, and nobody wants that. Purchase sandpaper at any home improvement or hardware store, like Home Depot or Lowe’s. Rub the metal surface down with sandpaper in a circular motion until you have removed the old paint. You should be down to bare metal by the end of the process. Switch back and forth between arms to prevent fatigue and soreness. Take a break if you need one. You don’t have to finish this project in one sitting."

You can purchase body filler at any automotive retailer, from O’Reilly’s to Auto Zone, and also in many home improvement stores. Mix the filler up well to make sure it’s loose and not clumpy when applied. It hardens quickly, so repeat the process in small batches as often as necessary. [4] X Research source Apply it in a layer about 1/8” thick."

If you’re not satisfied that the surface is perfectly smooth and ready to be painted, apply another layer of body filler and sand it down again. When you’re satisfied with the smoothness of the surface, move on to the next phase: painting your bike."

[5] X Research source Follow the instructions on the packaging for the brand you purchase to figure out which hardener you should mix it with. Make sure to do this at the automotive store so you can buy the hardener at the same time. These products can vary significantly in their treatment needs, so don’t work by a rule of thumb — always follow the specific instructions. Mix the primer with the hardener. Pour the solution into the can of your spray gun . Apply one coat evenly onto the bike, allow it to dry, then repeat. Follow the recommended drying times on the packaging for the primer you bought. When applying any product with a spray gun, make sure to move the spray slowly and evenly across the surface."
