      "content": "Put your bed and nightstands completely on top of a large rug. If you want your rug to fill up most of the space in your bedroom, choose a rug you can center underneath your bed. Set all of the furniture legs on top of your rug to make your room seem cohesive. Try to leave at least 10 inches (25 cm) from the edge of the rug and the room’s trim. [1] X Research source This layout works best when you have a large bedroom so there’s still space between the walls and the edges of your rug. If you have a bench at the end of your bed, make sure the rug extends 10 inches (25 cm) past it so you have comfortable walking space."

      "content": "Position the rug 5 in (13 cm) from your nightstands. Turn your rug so the long edge is parallel to the foot of your bed. Only 2 of your bed’s legs will sit on top of the rug. Leave a gap between your nightstands and the rug, but make sure the rug comes up far enough that you can step onto it easily when you get out of bed. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Set the rug under the bottom third of the bed. Keep the long edge of the rug parallel to the foot of your bed. Slide the rug under the legs so it only covers the floor under the bottom third of your bed. Let the edges of the rug come out on the sides and end of your bed. [3] X Research source Only covering a portion of the floor space under the bed lets you use a smaller and more affordable rug to decorate your bedroom ."

      "content": "Place runner rugs along the sides of the bed. If you aren’t able to splurge on a large area rug, surround the sides of the bed with 3 ft × 5 ft (0.91 m × 1.52 m) runners . Since runners are smaller and more affordable, they work well with any bed size and make a great solution when you’re on a budget. [4] X Research source You can set your nightstands on top of the runners or leave a few inches between them and the edges of the rugs. You can also put a runner at the end of your bed to make it more comfortable."

      "content": "Twin or full bed: 6 ft × 9 ft (1.8 m × 2.7 m) rug Since twin and full beds are smaller, you can get by using a smaller area rug. Using a rug that’s much larger could overwhelm the space and make your room feel smaller than it actually is. [5] X Research source If you have 2 twin beds in a room, then set both of them on top of a 9 ft × 12 ft (2.7 m × 3.7 m) rug."

You can easily position an 8 ft × 10 ft (2.4 m × 3.0 m) under all the furniture in your bedroom, or use it to cover the bottom half of the bed. [6] X Research source If you have the budget, opt for a rug that’s larger when you have a queen bed to help fill your space."

Otherwise, you can turn the rug horizontally to position it under the bottom half or two-thirds of the bed. [7] X Research source You may be able to use an 8 ft × 10 ft (2.4 m × 3.0 m) rug if you only want the bottom half of your bed on it."

Take the loose edge of the rug and line it up so it’s at least 2 feet (61 cm) from the mattress so you have some cushion on the floor around your bed.> Don’t forget to clean under your bed before you put the rug down."

Hold the edge of the rug in place and slowly unroll the rug. Once you unroll it past the legs, set your bed down to hold your rug in place.

Try using something like natural fiber underneath a fluffy fur rug to make an accented border, or a patterned rug on top of one with a solid color to make your space look more interesting. You can put area rugs in a carpeted room to give your bedroom a little more dimension too."
