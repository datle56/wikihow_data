      "content": "Understand the importance of a qualified attorney. When a trust is created, you will be placing certain pieces of property in the hands of a trustee, which is a person who holds the property for the benefit of beneficiaries. Once an irrevocable trust is created and executed, you will not be able to change the terms of the trust or cancel the trust altogether. Also, if a trust is executed properly, you will minimize your possible tax responsibility and protect assets from creditors. Therefore, because of the consequences that flow from the creation of an irrevocable trust, enlisting the help of a qualified attorney will be helpful. For example, if an irrevocable trust is created without the help of an attorney and one of the provisions is not exactly how you want it, you may not be able to fix it. You should strive to get it right the first time so you do not have problems in the future. [1] X Research source"

To find an attorney who specializes in trusts and estates, you should start by asking people you know. oftentimes, the people you know will have set up trusts themselves or know people that have done so. If you have hired an attorney in the past, even one in a different discipline, ask that attorney for a referral. Ask your parents who helped them set up their estate. Discuss attorney options with friends you trust. If they know any attorneys, ask them questions about their experience with the attorney they are recommending. Was the attorney attentive and respectful? Did the attorney complete the task diligently and ethically?"

In California, for example, the state bar website offers three types of services to help you find a qualified attorney. First, you have the option of typing in a lawyer's name or bar number. This is a great resource if you have already gotten referrals and you want to check their background, expertise, and history of discipline. Second, you can contact California's Legal Services programs, which help low income, seniors, and persons with disabilities find an attorney.

There are a number of websites you can use to review an attorney's background, experience, discipline history, and client feedback. Some of these sites include Avvo.com, FindLaw, LawHelp.org, and Lawyers.com. Visit these sites, type in the name of an attorney you are interested in, and see what has been said about them. However, be aware that client feedback can be positive or negative for any number of reasons and it may not reflect the true nature of the attorney's abilities. For example, a positive review may come from a longtime friend who is simply trying to put in a good word for their buddy. On the other hand, a negative review could be from a client who lost a case even though the attorney performed well."

      "content": "Understand the difference between a revocable and an irrevocable trust. Before you decide which type of trust you will be setting up, it is helpful to understand the difference between these two type of trusts, which centers on how much control you wish to have over your assets. [4] X Research source If you set up a revocable trust, you can rewrite and change the terms of the trust as much as you would like during the lifetime of the trust. Once you set up an irrevocable trust, however, you place all control over the trust into the hands of the trustee (the person you designate to manage your trust), and you will need the consent of everyone involved to change the terms of the trust. An irrevocable trust involves three parties (you, the person managing the trust, and the people who will ultimately receive the assets placed into the trust). You will be permanently transferring control of any assets placed into the trust to the person managing the trust—referred to as the trustee."

One reason you may wish to set up an irrevocable trust is to make sure that a disabled loved one is properly cared for. Because the terms of an irrevocable trust are not easily changed, you can rest assured that this person will be provided for using the assets in the trust. In addition, you can word the trust in such a way that the trustee will be able to use the funds to provide for the disabled beneficiary without limiting that person's ability to apply for need-based government benefits because he or she doesn't actually own the property placed into the trust.

      "content": "Set up an irrevocable trust to gain tax advantages. An irrevocable trust can also provide a certain amount of tax sheltering for assets that appreciate in value over time. For example, if you were to simply give away a piece of real estate, the asset's value for tax purposes would be the same as if you still possessed it. However, if you gift the same property using an irrevocable trust, when it is inherited the taxable value will be adjusted to reflect its appreciated value, resulting in far less tax liability for the person who receives it. You can also set up the trust so that all income generated by the trust is tax-deferred until the beneficiaries actually receive it. Because you will be transferring property out of your control, you will also receive tax benefits because you will no longer have to pay taxes on property placed into the trust (as it is no longer legally yours)."

Due to the fact that the terms of an irrevocable trust cannot be easily modified, placing assets into a trust with a particular set of individuals or charities named as beneficiaries can ensure that your money goes where you want it to after you pass away. While you won't be able to directly control the assets after they are placed into the trust, you control how and to who they will be disbursed when you create the trust document, and you can rest assured that your assets will be distributed according to your intentions."

Before these assets can be distributed according to the terms of the decedent's will, the will must go through a process called probate, which refers to the legal proceeding required to prove the will and its terms are legal and genuine. Setting up an irrevocable trust allows any assets you place into it to avoid the probate process when you pass away. This also has privacy benefits, as courts (and, with them, the public record), will not be able to touch or see the trust property upon the death of the grantor."

[11] X Research source Consider naming a successor trustee who will manage the trust in the event the original trustee can no longer act as the trustee for whatever reason. Consider appointing a trusted family member as your trustee to save on the costs of an independent trustee.

If the trust has no beneficiaries, the property goes back to your estate. [13] X Research source You do not have to specifically name all beneficiaries.

Don't just obtain a model form and fill in the blanks without reading the form thoroughly.
