      "title": "Use an acronym to help you remember words in a specific order.",
      "content": "Use an acronym to help you remember words in a specific order. An acronym is a type of mnemonic device in which the first letter of each word in a word, phrase, or sentence corresponds to something you want to memorize. You can create your own acronym to help you remember words in a specific sequence, or simply to remember a group of words. [1] X Research source For example, “Please Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally.” This mnemonic is often used to help people remember the order of operations for solving algebra problems. P stands for parentheses, E-exponents, M-multiply, D-divide, A-add, and S-subtract in the sentence. A popular mnemonic device in the musical world is Every Good Boy Deserves Fudge, which stands for the notes in the treble staff: EGBDF. [2] X Research source The fake name acronym ROY G BIV has long helped people remember the colours in the rainbow: Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Indigo, and Violet. [3] X Research source Math uses the acronym PEMDAS for remembering orders of operations, while English grammar uses FANBOY as a memory tool for conjunctions.

      "content": "Assign an image to what you need to memorize. Associating an image with a word or concept is another powerful way to commit it to memory. [5] X Expert Source Ted Coopersmith, MBA Academic Tutor Expert Interview. 10 July 2020. Try taking an interesting image and look at it often as you read the material you want to memorize. This can also be very helpful for memorizing people's names. [6] X Research source If you need to memorize the names of 5 coworkers you have just met, think of an image that you can associate with each person's name. For example, you could associate Charlie with the image of the cartoon character Charlie Brown, Michael with an image of the archangel Michael, Cindy with iconic supermodel Cindy Crawford, Donna with a 50s doo-wop singer, and Herbert with a bowl of sherbet."

      "title": "Talk out loud as you study.",
      "content": "Talk out loud as you study. Reading information out loud, explaining concepts to yourself, or even just making the occasional comment to yourself as you work can help to solidify the information that you are studying. Try talking to yourself as you study the material that you need to memorize. [7] X Research source If you are studying in a library, then make sure that you are in a section where some noise is permitted."

      "title": "Make your own flashcards and study them daily.",
      "content": "Make your own flashcards and study them daily. Flashcards are a classic memorization tool. Write the concept, cue, or subject on 1 side of the card, and then write the definition, line, or other details you need to memorize on the other side. Make sure all of the flashcards are facing in 1 direction in your stack and go through the pile. Look at the concept or cue side first and see if you can recall the definition or line on the other side. If not, read it a few times to commit it to memory. Then, move on to the next card. [8] X Research source Continue through the pile in this manner to memorize the information."

    {
      "title": "Write a summary",
      "content": "Write a summary for each paragraph to understand it better. As you read the material that you want to memorize, write a summary of each of the paragraphs you read. Write the summary in your own way of speaking to help you retain the information. This will help you to gain a basic understanding of the material and you may even memorize some key terms and concepts in the process. [10] X Research source For example, after reading a paragraph on how the heart pumps blood, explain it to yourself briefly in 1 to 2 sentences."

      "title": "Compartmentalize the information into smaller chunks.",
      "content": "Compartmentalize the information into smaller chunks. It is difficult to memorize long strings of numbers and words, such as identification numbers or lines in a play. If you need to memorize a large amount of material, break it down into more manageable chunks to make it easier on yourself. Some ways you can do this include: [11] X Research source Color-coding your notes by topic. Memorizing a 3 to 4-word phrase or 3 to 4 numbers at a time. Focusing on the key terms in 1 paragraph or page in a textbook."

      "title": "Try rhyming mnemonic devices to remember dates and other facts.",
      "content": "Try rhyming mnemonic devices to remember dates and other facts. Your brain may find it easier to remember certain facts if you put them into the form of a rhyme. Choose a date, fact, or other important detail that you need to memorize. Then, choose a word that rhymes with it and create a short rhyming sentence. Some popular rhyming mnemonic devices include: [12] X Research source In fourteen hundred ninety-two, Columbus sailed the ocean blue. Thirty days has September, April, June, and November."

      "title": "Write the information out over and over again.",
      "content": "Write the information out over and over again. Hand-writing is a powerful tool for memorization, and it is even more effective if you do it repeatedly. Get out a pen and paper and start hand-writing what you need to memorize. You can write out your lines for a play, definitions for key terms, math equations, or whatever it is you need to commit to memory. [13] X Research source If you prefer, you can also record yourself reading the information and then listen to the recording repeatedly. This is a good option if you have a log commute or if you just learn better by hearing things."

    {
      "title": "Relate the information to something you already understand.",
      "content": "Relate the information to something you already understand. Choose a topic that interests you and that you understand very well. Then, find a way to relate the information you need to memorize to the subject you already understand. [14] X Research source For example, you could relate the material you need to memorize for a math test to the rules of baseball if you are a sports fan, or use a cooking analogy to help you remember a chemistry concept if you are a fan of cooking."

      "title": "Memorize the information over several days or weeks.",
      "content": "Memorize the information over several days or weeks. The sooner you start memorizing, the better! It takes time and repetition to memorize something. Plan to begin memorizing the material at least 1 week in advance, and even sooner if possible. Work on memorizing the material for a set amount of time every day. The time you will need will vary depending on the amount of material you need to memorize. [15] X Research source For example, if you need to memorize 20 new vocabulary words for a test, then you might only need to study for 30 minutes per day over the course of a week. However, if you need to memorize lines for a leading role in a play, then you will need to start memorizing 3 to 4 weeks in advance and plan to study your lines for at least an hour daily."

      "title": "Quiz yourself on the material you have studied.",
      "content": "Quiz yourself on the material you have studied. You might find the material familiar when you re-read it and think that this means you have memorized it. However, this is not an accurate way to check for memorization. Self-testing is better for seeing how well you are retaining the material. Try to recall the information without looking at your notes. If you can recall the information accurately without help, then you have memorized it. [16] X Research source For example, if you need to be able to explain photosynthesis for a science test, then see if you can do this without checking your notes first. If you need to be able to recite a poem from memory, then try to recite it."

After you have studied the material and feel that you have a good understanding of it, try to explain it to a friend or family member. If you can do this without checking your notes, then you have memorized the information. [17] X Research source"

      "title": "Create an environment that is free from distractions.",
      "content": "Create an environment that is free from distractions. Avoid multitasking while you memorize, such as checking your social media accounts or texting friends. This will interfere with your ability to focus on the task at hand. Put away your phone, turn off the TV, and ask members of your household not to disturb you while you are studying. [22] X Research source If you have trouble staying focused, try setting small goals and rewarding yourself with a short break each time you meet one of them. For example, you could make it your goal to focus on studying for 25 minutes, and then reward yourself with a 5 minute break."

      "content": "Plan to memorize in the afternoon rather than in the morning or evening. Afternoon may be the time when you feel the least alert, but it has also been shown to be a potent time to work on memorizing new information. If you have been struggling to remember the material you are studying, try memorizing it in the afternoon instead of in the morning or at night. [23] X Research source For example, you could work on memorizing at around 2 or 3 pm."

      "content": "Get a good night of sleep before you start memorizing. Being well-rested has a far-reaching impact on your ability to memorize. To give yourself the best possible chance of retaining information, go to bed early enough to get a full 8 hours of sleep. [24] X Research source Try going to bed a little earlier than you normally do, such as 10:00 pm if you normally got to bed at 10:30 pm. Make your bedroom a relaxing space that you only use for sleep. Don't work, eat, or do other daytime activities in your bedroom."
