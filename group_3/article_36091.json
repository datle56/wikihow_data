Select “Show Home Button.” Now click “Change,” then select “Use the New Tab Page.” Click “Ok” to save your changes. Verify your search engine settings in the Settings menu by clicking “Manage Search Engines” under “Search.” Choose the search engine you use and select “Make default.” Make sure the URL on the right side of the screen matches the name of the search engine! If you see Yahoo.com on the left, but the URL on the right starts with anything other than search.yahoo.com, delete it with the X marker on the screen. Firefox: In the Open menu, select “Options,” then “Restore to Default.” Click OK to continue. To verify Search Engine settings, click the Open menu and select “Options.” On the left bar, click “Search” and set your default search engine to something reputable like Google or Bing.

Browse through the list and see if anything stands out as adware. It’s a good idea to search the internet from a non-infected computer for the names of anything you don’t recognize—some things may look legitimate when they actually aren’t, and vice-versa. Next to the name of the software you’ll find the company who published it. The companies listed can help you figure out which startup programs are legitimate. To disable anything you don’t recognize, remove the check from the box preceding it (or if you’re on Windows 8 or 10, click the program, then click “Disable”)."
