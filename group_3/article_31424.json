      "content": "Use SPF 30 or higher sunscreen every day, regardless of the weather. The sun’s rays can still hurt your skin even when it’s cold, rainy, or cloudy outside.

      "content": "Avoid being outside while the sun is at its strongest. The hours from 10 am to 4 pm are generally the ones during which the sun’s rays are at their strongest. If you’re going to spend time outside, try to do so during the early morning or late evening hours to avoid getting a tan. [4] X Research source Pay attention to the length of your shadow—if it’s shorter than you, the sun is shining strongly. If it’s longer than you, that means the rays aren’t as dangerous."

      "content": "Wear a large, floppy hat and UV sunglasses when you’re outside. These accessories will help protect your eyes, face, and even your shoulders from unwanted sun exposure. [5] X Expert Source Mohiba Tareen, MD FAAD Board Certified Dermatologist Expert Interview. 26 March 2020.

[6] X Research source Don’t forget to wear those sunglasses while you’re driving. The reflection of the sun off of asphalt or concrete can actually burn your eyes!"

      "content": "Find shade or use an umbrella if you have to be outside. If you are going to be outdoors during those peak 10 am to 4 pm hours, make it a point to spend time in the shade. If you can’t access a shady spot, bring an umbrella with you to block out the sun’s rays. This will help prevent unwanted sun exposure. [7] X Research source You can still get a tan even when you’re in the shade, so don’t forget to wear your sunscreen."

      "title": "Choose darker, closely-woven clothing to keep the sun off of your skin.",
      "content": "Choose darker, closely-woven clothing to keep the sun off of your skin. You can even look for clothes that have an Ultraviolet Protection Factor (UPF) rating. White or light-colored clothing let through more UV rays than darker shades do. Even if it’s warm out, choose clothing options that are lightweight but that will still cover the majority of your skin for optimal protection. [8] X Research source Staying out of the sun altogether is the most surefire way to not get a tan, but it’s nearly impossible to have zero sun exposure. Take a little extra care when you get ready for your day to choose clothes that’ll help protect your skin, regardless of what your plans entail."

      "content": "Wear protective clothing even when it’s warm outside. If you can, wear clothes that provide UV protection, and choose items that cover as much of your body as possible. Of course, you want to avoid overheating, so use your best judgment to choose what attire is right for you. [11] X Research source For example, if you’re playing soccer outdoors in the summer, you could choose to wear a high-collared T-shirt and athletic pants rather than a tank top and shorts."

      "title": "Plan ahead based on the activity you’ll be doing.",
      "content": "Plan ahead based on the activity you’ll be doing. What you wear, where you apply extra sunscreen, and how often you reapply the sunscreen can all be dictated by the actual outdoor activity you’re going to participate in. For example: [12] X Research source Biking: the back of your neck, your forearms, and your thighs will be exposed to the sun much more than the rest of your body. Wear longer biking shorts, consider putting a bandana around your neck, and stop to reapply sunscreen to exposed skin every hour if you’re sweating a lot, or every 2 hours if you’re going at a more leisurely pace. Running, hiking, tennis, golf, volleyball, and other similar activities: Chances are, you’ll be sweating a lot during these activities. Set a timer on your phone to remind yourself to reapply sunscreen every 1 to 2 hours. Additionally, you could try to play or participate in these activities when it isn’t as sunny out, like before 10 am or after 4 pm. Swimming or boating: The sun will be reflecting off the water, so make sure to wear UV sunglasses when you can, and consider choosing a water-proof sunscreen. Even when wearing water-proof sunscreen, you’ll still need to reapply it every 1 to 2 hours."

The sun’s rays can still perforate the clouds or affect your skin even during the winter. Hiking, skiing, snowboarding, and other winter-time activities require the same protection as summer-time ones do.

      "content": "Be aware of surfaces that reflect sunlight more strongly. Sun reflects off of snow, ice, water, sand, and concrete. Playing basketball on the concrete or participating in a game of sand-volleyball are great activities, but they increase the sun-exposure your skin is getting. Wear your UV sunglasses, sunscreen, SPF lip balm, and protective clothing to help prevent getting a tan. [14] X Research source Try to plan your activities for morning or evening hours for optimal protection."
