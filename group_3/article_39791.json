      "content": "Skilometer is a slang term for a British or European smile. The made-up word is a combination of “kilometer” and “smile,” meant to be a joke about how British people use the metric system of measurement (which measures distance in kilometers) rather than the imperial measurement system (which measures distance in miles) used by the U.S. [1] X Research source Basically, “skilometer” is a silly pun. The joke is that since Americans “s-mile,” Europeans must “s-kilometer” since they measure in kilometers instead!"

      "content": "Skilometer comes from a meme posted to Reddit in 2020. Reddit user u/Awesome_Me_17 posted the first skilometer meme to Reddit’s /r/memes on October 31st, 2020, joking that Europeans “skilometer” instead of “smile” because they use the metric system, not the imperial system. The original skilometer meme has received over 45,000 upvotes in roughly 4 years! [2] X Research source The meme features 4 panels; the top 2 depict a cartoon figure yelling, “Smile!” and a crowd of people labeled, “Europeans” looking angry. The bottom 2 panels depict a cartoon figure yelling, “S-kilometer!” followed by the same crowd of people smiling."

There are tons of different skilometer memes now, mainly because people have paired the joke with their own favorite images—so look for a reaction image that conveys anger, sadness, or disappointment. [3] X Research source The negative reaction image is meant to convey how Europeans feel when told to “smile” or realizing they “smile” and not “skilometer.”"

      "content": "Tell European (and non-American) friends to “skilometer.” If you have friends living in a country that uses the metric system and kilometers rather than miles, you can skip the memes and joke around with them directly! The next time you’re about to tell them to smile, or say that something made you smile, use “skilometer” instead and see if they get the joke! For example, if your friend sends you a funny picture, you could respond playfully and say, “Haha, you really made me skilometer!” Even if your friend doesn’t get the joke right away, just send them a skilometer meme as an explanation."

      "content": "Make your own memes or jokes about skilometer. Not only do people use different reaction images; they also rephrase the joke in new and silly versions. So, if you make your own meme, keep in mind that you don’t have to use the original “Smile!” versus “S-kilometer!” meme format. For example, other versions of the meme include: A reaction image paired with a statement like “Europeans when they realize they smile, not skilometer.” A reaction image paired with “Europeans when someone smiles instead of skilometers.” A reaction image paired with “Europeans when their partner smiles, not skilometers.” Basically, you can use \"skilometer\" like a verb (an action) or noun (for the facial expression), just like you'd use the word \"smile.\" Choose the joke you like best and see what you can do with it!"

It’s not about which system of measurement is better or intended to create arguments between people. So, when you use the skilometer joke, keep things positive and gently teasing.
