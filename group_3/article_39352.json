      "content": "The United States Postal Service (USPS) prohibits the shipment of alcoholic beverages. If you’re someone who is looking to ship alcohol as a gift or for personal consumption and aren’t a licensed alcohol retailer, you won’t be able to use a courier service to send a bottle. Unless you’re a government employee sending alcohol to another employee for official testing purposes, you won’t be able to use the Postal Service to ship any alcohol. USPS also recommends that you avoid shipping normal items in containers with alcohol labels, since this might cause them to be confiscated. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "You can ship alcohol through UPS or FedEx if you’re a licensed retailer. While USPS has a blanket ban on shipping alcohol, other major couriers, like FedEx and UPS, will ship alcohol directly to consumers as long as you're a licensed alcohol seller, winery, or distillery. Individuals won’t be able to use this service. [2] X Research source You’ll need to be a state-licensed seller with a contract with UPS or FedEx to ship alcohol. If you’re just someone who wants to send a bottle as a gift, UPS won’t be an option. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Use an alcohol delivery app. In recent years, apps like Drizly and Thirstie have become popular and convenient ways to get alcohol directly delivered. These apps work with retailers across the country to offer direct-to-door alcohol delivery. This makes them perfect for when you want to send a gift or get alcohol sent to you, and keeps you from having to worry about all the laws surrounding shipping. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Work with an alcohol retailer directly. If you’re trying to send someone a bottle of wine or spirits as a gift, try contacting a retailer within their state. An in-state retailer will have a way easier time getting alcohol shipped to you or someone else, since they possess the proper licenses to do so. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Follow the local and state laws where you’re shipping alcohol. Each state has its own set of laws regulating the shipping of alcohol, which include rules on what kinds of alcohol can be shipped and in what quantities (some states don't allow shipping at all!). Familiarize yourself with these laws before sending out any alcohol to consumers—otherwise, you could end up losing your shipment. [6] X Research source The National Conference of State Legislators (NCSL) has a great overview of local laws for shipping alcohol, broken up by state. Keep in mind that some states, like Mississippi, won’t allow alcohol to be shipped directly to a consumer unless that consumer purchases the alcohol in-person.

To do so, you’ll need to first talk with a representative of one of these services for a consultation appointment, then sign a contract.

If you're shipping from a brewery or a distillery, note that most states won't recieve the alcohol from out of state. Before making any plans, look for more info on state shipping laws: [9] X Research source Some states do not allow out-of-state direct to customer shipping: Utah, Mississippi, Alabama, Oklahoma, Rhode Island, Delaware, and several districts in Kentucky, for example. For breweries, only 7 states let you make an out-of-state sale directly to consumers: Nebraska, Ohio, Virginia, New Hampshire, North Dakota, Vermont, Oregon, as well as Washington D.C. For distilleries, only 3 states allow you to ship directly from out-of-state: Nebraska, New Hampshire, and North Dakota allow this."

You’ll need to be a licensed vendor of alcohol in your state and have a brief consultation appointment with an agent at one of these carrier services.

      "content": "Talk to an alcohol importer or organize the proper documentation to ship abroad. Shipping alcohol between countries is very difficult without an importer. Since shipping alcohol abroad requires a great deal of documentation that varies depending on the country, it’s important to know all the rules and required forms beforehand. Talking to an alcohol importer or exporter can make this process much simpler. [11] X Research source"

      "content": "Back in the early 20th century, each state created unique, uncoordinated shipping laws. The temperance movement (which was set on banning alcohol) was at the height of its influence. So when the prohibition of alcohol ended in the 1930s, states all came up with their own laws on how to handle the shipping and trade of alcohol. These different laws have led us to the system we have today. [12] X Research source"
