      "content": "Clean your extracted teeth thoroughly if you pulled them out yourself. If you extract your tooth at home, you'll need to follow the same protocol that a dentist would when cleaning it. First, use mild soap and water to remove any blood or residue from the tooth. Then, boil the tooth for 5-10 minutes to stop bacterial growth and decay. [6] X Research source Alternatively, soak the tooth in a 50% bleach, 50% water solution for 72 hours to disinfect it. [7] X Research source Rinse the tooth with clean water to remove the bleach solution. Make sure you wash your hands before and after handling extracted teeth. [8] X Research source"

      "title": "Place the extracted teeth in a sealable container.",
      "content": "Place the extracted teeth in a sealable container. Once you’ve cleaned your tooth, find a well-made container to store it in. This container should be durable and prevent leaking—a sealable, shatter-proof container is best. [9] X Research source “A glass jar or a securely sealed plastic container works well to shield the tooth from harmful substances and physical damage,” says Dr. Adatrow. Dr. Adatrow also advises to “clearly label the container with essential information, including the extraction date, tooth number, and any pertinent details.” This will help you identify the tooth easily in the future."

      "content": "Put your extracted teeth in saline solution for proper storage. To keep your extracted tooth hydrated, submerge it in a sealed, shatter-proof container of saline solution (1 g of salt for 100 mL of water). [10] X Research source Do not store your teeth in tap water. This type of storage solution is best if you’re only storing your teeth for a few days. If you’d like to store them for a longer period, submerge them in 10% formalin instead. Storing extracted teeth with amalgam in 10% formalin solution can disinfect the internal and external structures of teeth for up to 2 weeks.

Household bleach is a great disinfectant and should help keep any bacteria from forming on your extracted teeth. Dilute common household bleach in a 1:10 ratio with regular tap water, then submerge your teeth in the solution. [12] X Research source"
