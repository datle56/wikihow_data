To see if you can post a picture in a comment, tap the typing area where you'd normally type a comment , then tap the photo icon on the right. If you don't see a photo icon, the feature is not available to you."

      "content": "Who can post a photo in a comment? TikTok doesn't say who has access to this feature, but there are many rumors that picture commenting is only available in Egypt and possibly only on some phone models. Some TikTokers claim you can use a VPN to change your location to Egypt to get the feature, but this didn't work in our testing. We also tested many other suggested workarounds, including stickers in keyboard apps like Gboard, pasting GIFs from other apps, pasting pictures from your camera roll, and typing file names into special codes. None of these actually work. Posting photos in comments is also rumored to have only been available in the TikTok beta testing app for a short while in 2023 but has since been removed. While joining the beta testers won't get you the feature for sure, you may want to join anyway so you'll be one of the first to get it if it returns. On Android, go to https://play.google.com/apps/testing/com.zhiliaoapp.musically and click Become a Tester . You'll then receive the latest beta version of TikTok on your phone or tablet. On iPhone, install the TestFlight app from the App Store, then open the app and complete the welcome screens. Once finished, go to https://testflight.apple.com/join/OTGrzX7C and click Start Testing to get the beta update."

This is similar to replying with a video, except it works with still photos. [1] X Research source This method isn't perfect—replying to a comment with a photo creates a new TikTok post for the photo. If you're worried about cluttering up your TikTok profile with photos meant for comments, you probably shouldn't do this."
