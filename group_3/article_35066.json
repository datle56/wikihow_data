      "content": "A razor blade necklace can represent mental health awareness. For many people, wearing a razor blade necklace expresses support for people diagnosed with a mental illness. They themselves might have a mental illness and want to show their solidarity with others who may be struggling. Or, they might simply want to communicate that they empathize with mental health struggles and are a safe space if people need help. Some people might wear a razor blade necklace if they’re currently struggling with their mental health. It can be a symbol of the challenges they’re experiencing and the strength they have to overcome them. If you’re currently struggling with your mental health, Dr. Mesrobian suggests you \"recognize the negative thought you are experiencing and challenge it...Write it down and identify all the reasons why it may not be true.” Never hesitate to reach out for support if you need it. According to Dr. Mesrobian, “It is important to have a supportive environment when coping with mental illness .”"

      "content": "A razor blade necklace can symbolize resilience while recovering from self-harm. For people who are dealing with or have dealt with self-harm, a razor blade necklace might symbolize the pain they’ve endured and ultimately overcome. It can be a constant reminder of their strength and how far they’ve progressed on the road to recovery. Some people find wearing a razor necklace empowering. It can show that they’re no longer hiding the pain they’ve dealt with and are reclaiming their power. However, other people who’ve dealt with self-harm may find razor blade necklaces triggering or offensive—which is perfectly normal and valid, too. If you find yourself feeling triggered by a razor blade necklace, Dr. Mesrobian says to “remove yourself from the environment you are in and place yourself in an environment that provides safety,” if possible. If you can’t leave, “close your eyes,” “ take a few deep breaths ,” and “start imagining a place that feels happy and safe using each of your senses.” If a friend or family member wears a razor blade necklace often and it bothers you, talk to them about it and see if they are willing to stop wearing it around you while you recover and learn to control your triggers .

      "content": "Some people find the necklaces offensive to wear while others do not. Some people see razor blade necklaces as powerful symbols of dealing with mental illness, addiction, or self-harm, so they might find it offensive if someone wears the necklaces without having experienced these challenges themself.

They acknowledge that razor blade necklaces can simply be a fashion choice and don’t have to have a personal meaning to the wearer. People who don’t have experience with mental illness might not even associate razor blades with these challenges. They might see them as fashion statements similar to jewelry with knives, spikes, or safety pins on them. Ultimately, wearing a razor blade necklace is a personal choice . It is okay if it represents something personal to you or if you simply think it looks cool. It is also okay if you find them upsetting—your emotions and feelings are valid, too."
