      "content": "Find the width of the gutters. Gutters typically come in 5 or 6 in (13 or 15 cm) sizes, and can be “K-style” or “half-round.” Place a sturdy 20 ft (6.1 m) ladder on 1 side of your house so that you can reach the gutters. Carefully climb up the ladder and measure the width of the opening at the top of the gutters. [1] X Research source K-style gutters are L-shaped on the back, while the front has step-like increments. Half-round gutters are round on the bottom with a lip on the top of the outside edge."

      "content": "Measure the length of each gutter run. Run the tape measure from 1 corner of the gutter as far as you can go toward the opposite corner. Make a mark with chalk and record the measurement. Carefully climb down the ladder and move it to the chalk mark. Measure from the chalk mark to the opposite corner of the gutter, making another chalk mark and moving the ladder again if necessary. [2] X Research source Continue around the perimeter of your home until you have measured and recorded the entire length of the existing gutters. Gutters and downspouts are typically sold in 10 ft (3.0 m) lengths."

      "content": "Measure the height of each downspout. If you have downspouts, position and climb the ladder so you can place the measuring tape at the top of 1 downspout. Measure from the top to the ground, then add 4 feet (1.2 m) to each downspout to account for the angled extension at the bottom that directs water away from the home. Record your measurement, then repeat the process for all the other downspouts. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Count the number of corners and end caps. Walk around your home and count the number of corner pieces and end caps on the gutters. Record this information and mark whether the end caps are right or left ends. [4] X Research source Each downspout requires 3 elbow pieces, so add those to your notes as well."

      "content": "Place a sturdy 20 ft (6.1 m) ladder against the roof and climb up. Position the ladder on 1 side of the house near the edge of the roof. Have someone hold the bottom of the ladder steady. Make sure you have both chalk and a measuring tape in your pocket or tool belt. [5] X Research source"

Write down the measurement, then climb down and move your ladder over toward the chalk mark. Continue measuring, recording, and moving your ladder until you can reach the end. Add all the measurements together to get the total horizontal length of 1 side. [6] X Research source"

Place 1 end of the measuring tape on 1 corner of the roof and measure to the opposite corner. Use the chalk to make marks and reposition the tape measure, if necessary. Write down the total measurement of the width of the roof. [7] X Research source Carefully climb back down the ladder when you’re finished."

Then, add the area of each side together to find the total square footage of the roof. [9] X Research source If you have a simple gable-end roof, you only need to multiply the length of one side by the width of the same side, then multiply the sum by 2 to get the total square footage."

Measure the distance between the midpoint of the underside of the level and the roof to find the pitch of a 12 in (30 cm) run. The size of the gap tells you the pitch. [10] X Research source For instance, a 2 in (5.1 cm) gap means the roof has a 2-in-12 pitch and a 6 in (15 cm) gap means the roof has a 6-in-12 pitch."

You need the pitch factor to find the adjusted square footage of the roof. A 0- to 3-in-12 pitch corresponds to a pitch factor of 1. A 4- to 5-in-12 pitch has a pitch factor of 1.05, while a 6- to 8-in-12 pitch has a pitch factor of 1.1. A 9- to 11-in 12 pitch as a pitch factor of 1.2, and a 12-in-12 or higher pitch has a pitch factor of 1.3. [11] X Research source"

Multiplying the roof-pitch factor, the intensity of rainfall, and the square footage of the roof will provide you with the adjusted square footage, which can be used to determine the size of gutters you’ll need. [12] X Research source For instance, if the square footage is 1,000 feet (300 m), the roof-pitch factor is 1.2, and the intensity is 5.7, multiply 1,000 x 1.2 x 5.7 to equal 6,270."

If the adjusted square footage is equal to or less than 2,500 feet (760 m), choose 5 in (13 cm) half-round gutters. For square footage up to 3,840 feet (1,170 m), use 6 in (15 cm) half-round gutters. If the adjusted square footage is equal to or less than 5,520 feet (1,680 m), choose 5 in (13 cm) K-style gutters. For square footage up to 7,960 feet (2,430 m), use 6 in (15 cm) K-style gutters.

A 2 in (5.1 cm) by 3 in (7.6 cm) rectangular downspout can add 600 square feet (55.7 square meters) of drainage area, while a 3 in (7.6 cm) round spout adds 706 square feet (65.6 square meters). You can add extra downspouts to increase the drainage area if necessary. [14] X Research source If you don’t want to add downspouts and the square footage of the roof is more than 7,960 feet (2,430 m), you’ll have to order custom 7 or 8 in (18 or 20 cm) gutters."
