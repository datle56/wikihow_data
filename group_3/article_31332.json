      "content": "Marketers and retailers use NFC tags for traffic and marketing purposes. For example, if you're sitting at a bus stop and your phone gives you an NFC alert, it may be picking up a tag in an advertisement on the back of the bench. Simply move your phone to your front pocket so it isn't resting against the bench in your back pocket. [2] X Research source Even some things like gym workout equipment are known to have NFC tags that send notifications to your phone. The only way to permanently get rid of these notifications is to contact the company that made the gym equipment to see if they can disable the NFC tags. You can't disable these notifications on iPhone, but since NFC only works within 2 inches, you can easily move your phone to another location. You can toggle NFC on and off with Android . Disable the NFC feature on Android by swiping down on your screen to display the Quick Menu, then tap the NFC icon to turn it off (the icon will be grey if it's off). [3] X Research source If you don't recognize the app or website that the NFC notification is prompting you to open, don't tap on it. Anyone can create an NFC tag , and not all links are from harmless advertisers."
