      "content": "Change the coil if the vape juice tastes burnt or less flavorful. Take a hit from your vape and pay attention to the flavor. If it has a burnt aftertaste or if the flavor seems sour, it is time to change your coil. Over time the juice starts to clog up the coil. [8] X Research source If you use sweet, sugary juices, they may clog up your coil more easily. The sweetener essentially caramelizes on the coil as it heats up. Additionally, if your coil looks brown or black, this is a sign that it is burnt and you should replace it."
