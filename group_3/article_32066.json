      "content": "Hold the pack upside down in your dominant hand. Flip the pack upside down so the tobacco will pack down towards the filter. Hold it in your dominant hand so you will be able to hit it against something with force. [2] X Research source This will also allow you to use your non-dominant hand as a flat surface to pack the pack against if you want to."

      "content": "Grip the pack with your fingers on the side or the front and back. Hold the pack like you are holding a closed book or some other flat object. Hold it firmly so it won't fly out of your hand when you hit it against something. [3] X Research source How you hold the pack is a matter of personal preference. However, do not place a finger on the bottom of the pack because it can make the tobacco pack unevenly and can even cause the cigarettes to break."

      "content": "Hit the top of the pack against a flat, hard surface or your hand several times. Remember that the top of the pack is facing downwards now because you are holding the pack upside down. Use medium force to hit the top of the pack against a flat surface, like a table, or against the heel of the palm of your non-dominant hand. [4] X Research source How many times you hit the pack is up to you. You will probably learn over time how many times is necessary to get the tobacco to pack to your liking. However, 5, 6, or 7 times is a good number to start."

Open up the pack and take out a cigarette. [6] X Research source Look into the tip of the cigarette before you smoke it to get an idea of how tighly-packed the tobacco is. You can adjust your packing technique next time to pack the cigarettes more or less by hitting the box less times."
