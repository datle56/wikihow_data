      "title": "Rotate the clasp until the groove on it faces upwards.",
      "content": "Rotate the clasp until the groove on it faces upwards. Turn the clasp with your fingers. You will soon see a vertical line running end to end along 1 side. The clasp opens along this line. [1] X Research source The standard barrel clasp has a groove. Pandora also sells some lobster clasps, which are like keychain hooks. You simply press the button to open the clasp, then slide the end of the bracelet off it."

      "title": "Insert your fingernails into the groove.",
      "content": "Insert your fingernails into the groove. Slide your thumbnail in first, followed by another fingernail if you can fit it. The easiest way to do this is with both thumbs, but you can do it with your other fingers as well. Position your thumbs so both nails touch back to back. Brace the sides of the clasp with your other fingers or the side of your body. After you get accustomed to opening the bracelet, you may be able to do it with a single nail. Starting with 2 nails is easier and gives you more leverage on the clasp."

      "title": "Pry the sides apart until the clasp opens.",
      "content": "Pry the sides apart until the clasp opens. Push both nails outwards to separate the ends of the clasp. Apply gentle but firm pressure. The clasp will soon pop open so you can remove or put on the bracelet. [2] X Research source To keep the charms secure, the clasp may be a little stiff and difficult to open. Apply more force to leverage it without the use of additional tools. If you have trouble opening the clasp, adjust your grip and try again. Most clasps pop open without much trouble, but you may need to get a clasp opener to remove a stuck clasp."

      "content": "Lift the rod out of the clasp to free the ends of the bracelet. The clasp is permanently secured to 1 end of the bracelet. The other end looks like a small plug. Simply pick it up and move it out of the clasp to finish opening the bracelet. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Pinch the thumb and forefinger.",
      "content": "Pinch the thumb and forefinger. Curl your fingers in like you're making a fist, but rest your fingertips on your palm. With your other hand, set the clasp on top of your forefinger, then squeeze it in place with your thumb. Position the opener so a flat, broad edge points away from you. [4] X Research source Pandora sells a clasp opener that looks like a flower pendant. It has 4 petals, each with a flat edge that can be used to open clasps. If you don't have a Pandora clasp opener, you can use a generic clasp opener. Look for tools designed for jewelry or even phones. You can also use small coins or other sturdy objects with a flat edge."

      "title": "Rotate the clasp until you see its groove.",
      "content": "Rotate the clasp until you see its groove. Turn the clasp with your fingers until you see a gap in the clasp. The gap is a vertical line running between the clasp's top and bottom edges. Face the groove upwards so you can get plenty of leverage with the opener."

      "title": "Insert the opener into the groove.",
      "content": "Insert the opener into the groove. Wedge the clasp opener's flat edge into the gap. Push it in as far as it will go, but avoid forcing it. [5] X Research source Hold the clasp steady by bracing it against your fingers or the side of your body."

      "title": "Pry the clasp open to free the bracelet.",
      "content": "Pry the clasp open to free the bracelet. Wiggle the clasp opener back and forth, pressing it against the sides of the clasp. Maintain a steady amount of pressure. The clasp will usually pop open right away without much of a struggle. Then, pull the bracelet's loose end out of the clasp to finish opening it. [6] X Research source If you can't open the clasp right away, adjust your grip on it. Make sure the opener is firmly wedged in the groove. The bracelet permanently attaches to the clasp at 1 end, so identify the removable side and pinch it between your fingers to lift it out."

    {
      "title": "Place the bracelet's rod into the open clasp.",
      "content": "Place the bracelet's rod into the open clasp. Take a look at the ends of the bracelet. The bracelet will have a small head shaped like a rod at one end. Make sure the clasp is open, then rest the rod in it. Push the rod as far as you can into the curved groove of the clasp. [7] X Research source The easiest way to put the bracelet on is by draping it over your wrist. Position the clasp on top of your wrist, then bring the rod end around to meet it. If the rod is outside of the groove, the clasp will not close correctly. The bracelet may end up falling off your wrist. Check the placement carefully as you close the clasp."

      "title": "Grasp the sides of the clasp with your fingers.",
      "content": "Grasp the sides of the clasp with your fingers. Place your thumb against one side of the clasp, then reach your forefinger over to the other side.

      "title": "Squeeze the ends of the clasp together to close it.",
      "content": "Squeeze the ends of the clasp together to close it. Bring your thumb and forefinger together to snap the clasp shut. You won't need to use a lot of force to do this. Check the clasp to make sure the head is secure inside of it. If the clasp seems loose, open it up and adjust it. Avoid forcing the clasp if it doesn't close correctly. You could end up breaking it. The problem likely is that the rod isn't snug in the clasp's groove. Open it up and try again."

      "content": "Rotate the bead so the opening groove faces upwards. The clip bead will be at the end of the bracelet, directly behind the rod component on the bracelet's latching mechanism.Turn the bead with your fingers. You can spin it on the bracelet until you see the groove. It is a thin gap that runs down the bead's side. [9] X Research source Note that you have to open the bracelet before you can open any beads. This allows the clip bead to prevent other components from sliding off the bracelet. Opening the clip bead is very similar to unlocking the bracelet itself. They both use the same type of mechanism."

      "title": "Insert your fingernails into the gap.",
      "content": "Insert your fingernails into the gap. Slip your thumbnail into the groove. You can usually snap open the bead with a single nail. If you need more leverage, try using your other thumb as well to pull the bead's sides in opposite directions.
