      "title": "Use this simple method primarily for linen and cotton.",
      "content": "Use this simple method primarily for linen and cotton. This method requires no special tools, but does take a significant amount of prolonged rubbing. It is especially suited to stains on natural fibres like linen and cotton. Fabrics whose surfaces fragment into small round surface balls, known as \"bobbles\" or \"pills,\" require a longer period of more gentle rubbing. These fabrics include wool and most artificial fibres."
    },
    {
      "title": "Turn the fabric so the stain is face-down.",
      "content": "Turn the fabric so the stain is face-down. In this position, water can work at the stain from the back, pushing it outward and off the fabric. Rinsing in this position is more effective than running the water directly onto the stain. [1] X Research source You may need to turn clothing inside out to achieve this. If you’re cleaning furniture, like a mattress or a couch, don’t worry about this step."
    },
    {
      "title": "Flush the stain with cold water.",
      "content": "Flush the stain with cold water. Even an old stain typically hasn't worked its way into the fabric completely, so start by removing the loosely attached surface portions. Run cold water over the back of the fabric, so it pushes through the stain. Hold the fabric in the running water for several minutes. [2] X Research source If you’re removing blood from furniture, wet a sponge with cold water and gently dab the area. Warning: never wash a blood stain in warm or hot water, which may cause it to bond permanently to the fibres of the fabric. [3] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Rub bar soap into the stain.",
      "content": "Rub bar soap into the stain. Turn the fabric over so the stain is face-up. Rub bar soap into the stain generously to produce a thick lather. Any soap can be used, but traditional solid block laundry soap may have a stiffer, more effective lather than milder hand soap. [4] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Grip the stained area with both hands.",
      "content": "Grip the stained area with both hands. Roll or scrunch up two areas of fabric, on either side of the stain. Grip one in each hand to provide a good grip on the area, allowing you to rub it together. [5] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Rub the stain against itself.",
      "content": "Rub the stain against itself. Turn the 2 handfuls of fabric so the stain is in 2 halves and facing each other. Rub the stained fabric against itself vigorously, or gently but quickly if the fabric is delicate. The friction you generate will slowly loosen the remaining particles of blood, which will remain in the lather rather than re-adhering to the fabric. If you’re worried about blisters, wear gloves to protect your hands. Tight-fitting latex or nitrile gloves will provide the least hindrance to grip and dexterity."
    },
    {
      "title": "Replace the water and soap and continue rubbing.",
      "content": "Replace the water and soap and continue rubbing. If the fabric starts getting dry or losing its lather, flush the stain with fresh water and re-apply the soap. Continue rubbing each stained area in this way until it is gone. If you see no improvement after 5 to 10 minutes, try rubbing more vigorously or move on to a different method. [6] X Research source If the stain is gone, rinse the fabric with cool water and let it air dry."

      "title": "Use this on any fabric, but cautiously on silk and wool.",
      "content": "Use this on any fabric, but cautiously on silk and wool. Meat tenderizer powder , sold in grocery stores, can break down the proteins found in blood stains. While it is recommended by some silk experts, meat tenderizer does have the potential to break down silk and wool fibres as well. Test this method on a small corner of these fabrics first to see if damage occurs. If you notice that the fabric changes color at all, don’t use this method. For a less harsh way to remove blood stains from silk , simply use a mixture of laundry detergent and water."

[7] X Research source Do not use seasoned meat tenderizer, as the seasonings may stain your fabric. Don’t have meat tenderizer? Try baking soda instead."

      "content": "Rinse out the paste before washing. After the hour is up, rinse the paste out with cold water. Wash the fabric as usual, but air dry rather than using a dryer, since the heat can cause remnants of the stain to set permanently. [9] X Research source"

      "title": "Use this method on any fabric besides wool and silk.",
      "content": "Use this method on any fabric besides wool and silk. Enzymatic cleaners break down proteins that form stains. Since blood stains bond to the fabric using proteins, enzymatic cleaners can be highly effective at removing them. However, wool and silk fibres are made from proteins and may break apart if exposed to an enzyme product."

      "title": "Use an enzymatic cleaner.",
      "content": "Use an enzymatic cleaner. If you are having trouble finding a cleaning product labeled \"enzymatic\" or \"enzyme cleaner,\" try a \"natural\" or \"earth-friendly\" laundry detergent or laundry pre-treatment, which often contain biodegradable enzymes. Enzymatic cleaners destroy the proteins that make up human blood. [10] X Research source Nature's Miracle and Seventh Generation laundry detergent both fall in this category. Blood protein spotters are also useful products. [11] X Expert Source Robert Shapiro Laundry Specialist Expert Interview. 24 August 2021."

The soaking time will depend on how old the dried blood stain is, and how strong the cleaning product is. Soak for at least 1 hour, or for as many as 8 hours. [13] X Research source Optionally, scrub the cleaner into the stain with a toothbrush before submerging."

      "title": "Use this method in sunny weather on sturdy fabrics.",
      "content": "Use this method in sunny weather on sturdy fabrics. This method uses common ingredients but requires sunlight to finish the process. You will also need to wait for the fabric to air dry before you can tell whether the stain was successfully removed, making it slower than most other methods. Use this method on fabrics like denim, cotton, and canvas. Warning: lemon juice and sun are both capable of harming delicate fabrics, especially silk."

      "content": "Use stain removers as a last resort. The substances used in this section are powerful stain removers.

      "content": "Use an ammonia mixture on cotton or cotton blends. Start with \" household ammonia \" or \"ammonia hydroxide,\" sold as a cleaning product. Dilute this with an equal amount of water, and leave it on the stain for 15 minutes before blotting and rinsing. If your \"test corner\" showed signs of damage, soak the fabric in a much weaker solution, such as 15 ml (1 tbsp) household ammonia, 1 L (1 quart) water, and a drop of liquid handwashing detergent. [17] X Research source Warning: ammonia may destroy the protein fibres that form silk or wool. Ammonia works very well on stains that have resisted other methods. [18] X Expert Source Robert Shapiro Laundry Specialist Expert Interview. 24 August 2021. Household ammonia is approximately 5—10% ammonia and 90–95% water. [19] X Research source Stronger ammonia solutions are highly caustic and need to be diluted even more."
