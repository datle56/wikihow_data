[5] X Research source One exercise is the \"heel-toe\" - starting with an open hi-hat and your toe pointed up, bring your toe down to close the hi-hat. Simultaneously, point your heel up. Then, switch again. After practicing this rhythmically for a minute or two, the muscles in your lower leg will start to burn. You will soon be able to do this for longer and longer, becoming more efficient in using the hi-hat pedal for long time periods."

      "content": "Loosen the hi-hat. This is to further the two cymbals from each other that they make more of a \"sizzling\" sound when struck. Playing traditional rock grooves with a looser hi-hat gives more of a metal feel."

As timekeeping is a primary function of the hi-hats, you should practice \"clicking\" or \"snapping\" the hats together on beat. This is usually done on each of the quarter notes (1-2-3-4) or every other eighth note (the \"ands\" - 1-&-2-&-3-&-4-&.)"
