    {
      "title": "Try using tweezers.",
      "content": "Try using tweezers. If any part of the splinter is visible above the surface of your skin, try removing it with tweezers. Choose tweezers with a serrated inner edge. Grab the tip of the splinter with a firm hold, and slowly pull it out. Sterilize the tweezers before using them. Wipe them with rubbing alcohol or vinegar, boil them in water for several minutes, or hold them over a flame for about a minute. Wash your hands before you try to remove your splinter."

      "title": "Use nail clippers for thick splinters.",
      "content": "Use nail clippers for thick splinters. If the splinter is thick and unlikely to break, a good alternative to tweezers is a sturdy pair of sterilized nail clippers. If the splinter is stuck into thick skin at an extreme angle, clip some overlaying skin to improve visibility and access to the splinter – it shouldn't hurt in thick-skinned areas that aren’t sensitive, like your heel. Cut your skin in a parallel direction to that of the splinter. Don't clip deeply enough to cause bleeding. A deeper wound will increase the risk of infection. [2] X Trustworthy Source Seattle Children's Hospital Health information provided by Seattle Children's hospital. Go to source When using nail clippers or tweezers, use your dominant hand if you can (this won't work if the splinter is in your dominant hand), so you have better dexterity and control."

      "title": "Use a needle to pry the splinter loose.",
      "content": "Use a needle to pry the splinter loose. For a deeper splinter that's below the surface of your skin, use a sterilized needle or pin to try and dig a portion of it up above the surface. Make a small hole in your skin over the end of the splinter closest to the surface. Try to lift the splinter up with the tip of the needle so you can grab it with tweezers or nail clippers. Don't try to completely dig the deep splinter out with the needle – you'll cause more damage and risk breaking the splinter."

    {
      "title": "Consider using a drawing salve.",
      "content": "Consider using a drawing salve. A drawing salve is a type of disinfectant that helps to dislodge deeper splinters by lubricating them and allowing them to \"slip out\" of your skin. Apply the drawing salve to the wound, and wait a day or so for it to dislodge the splinter. Cover the wound with a bandage in the meantime. Waiting for it to work may require some patience. One of the more common brands is Ichthammol (black drawing salve), which is found over-the-counter at most pharmacies. Drawing salves are greasy and may smell unpleasant. In most cases, the salve will only bring the splinter to the skin's surface – you'll still need to pluck it out with tweezers."

      "title": "Try adding some baking soda to the wound.",
      "content": "Try adding some baking soda to the wound. Baking soda is not only a good disinfectant, but it can slow down bleeding and help draw a deep splinter closer to the skin's surface. [3] X Research source If the splinter is made of glass, metal, or plastic, then soak the area for up to an hour in a basin of warm water with a few teaspoons of baking soda added. If the splinter is wood, make a thick baking soda paste with some water and apply it over your wound. Cover it with a bandage overnight. You will need to use tweezers or nail clippers to remove the splinter from your skin’s surface."

      "content": "Disinfect the punctured area. After you remove the splinter, focus on cleaning the small puncture wound. Wash it with warm water and soap, then dry it with a clean towel and wipe it with an alcohol wipe. Alcohol is an excellent disinfectant, but white vinegar, iodine, and hydrogen peroxide work well also.

These might sting when you apply them, but it only lasts a moment."
