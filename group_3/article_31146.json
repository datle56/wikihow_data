      "title": "Research emancipation laws in your country.",
      "content": "Research emancipation laws in your country. If you want to move out and be completely independent of your parents or guardians, consider legal emancipation . While most places declare 18 to be the age of majority, or legal independence, there are some places that offer exceptions for emancipation without an intense legal process. Research the age of majority for your area, whether your state or country allows emancipation, and how old you must be to file for emancipation. [1] X Research source Emancipation is a legal process that allows a minor to get a court order to be legally independent. It ends some or all of the responsibilities and rights of the parents, like financial support and making decisions for the child. Emancipation can be partial or complete. In some places, being married at 16 will automatically emancipate you. In other places, enlisting in the military before turning 18 may grant you emancipation. The age at which you can be emancipated varies depending on where you live. In most U.S. states, that age is 16, though for some it can be as young as 14. You will need to have your parent or guardian agree to your emancipation decision, as they will likely have to sign consent forms later on."

      "title": "Have a stable and consistent income.",
      "content": "Have a stable and consistent income. In order to be emancipated and move out at 16, you must be able to prove to the court that you have a source of income and can support yourself financially. This typically means having a job that pays well enough to cover things like rent, groceries, and bills. Keep in mind that minors fall under specific child labor laws, which prevent teens from working long hours, so it may be helpful to have side gigs, like babysitting, for additional income. [2] X Research source If you don’t already have one, start looking for a job and create a budget to show that you’re capable of handling your money responsibly. Remember to set aside an emergency fund, as well. If possible, start building your credit by applying for a credit card, as well. This will help you when it’s time to apply for an apartment or purchase a vehicle. Learn the difference between credit and debit and how to use each responsibly."

      "title": "Find a safe place to live.",
      "content": "Find a safe place to live. As you plan the legal emancipation process, have an idea of where you’re planning to stay. Depending on where you live, there may be different requirements on how a teenager can enter a housing contract, so make sure to do your research before filing for emancipation. [3] X Research source In many cases, minors possess no contractual capacity, which means they can void most contracts. While there are some exceptions, you may be able to void your rental contract if you find another place to live. These contracts are usually legally binding, though, as things like food and shelter are a necessity. Research the laws in your area before making any final decisions. Research apartments in your area that allow minors to sign leases. If possible, ask a trusted adult to co-sign so the landlord will be more likely to accept your application. In general, your monthly rent should be no more than 30% of your monthly income, so look for apartments that are within your budget. If renting your own apartment isn’t possible, see if anyone you know would allow you to rent a room in their house. Many people sublet their apartments, too, and these listings can often be found on websites like Craigslist. Just make sure these listings are legit, and don’t put yourself in any potentially dangerous situations."

      "content": "Enact a plan for completing your public education. Depending on where you live, you may have to stay in school even after emancipation. Make sure that your new housing situation is situated near a school, so that you don’t fall behind on your education. [4] X Research source If you take the bus to school, make sure to inform them of your new address. If you live in an area with multiple school districts, make sure you know which one your new residence falls under. If you rely on public transportation to get to school, you may have to transfer to the new district."

      "content": "Fill out all of the necessary paperwork. When you go through the emancipation process, there’s a variety of forms that you will need to sign. Many of these forms will have to be signed by your parent or guardian. Although these forms may differ by location, you should be able to find all of the documents you’ll need online. Visit your local courthouse and/or check their website to find all the forms you need. [5] X Research source Depending on where you live, some of these documents may need to be signed by a legal third party (i.e. a notary). Review all the paperwork carefully before signing. Make sure you know what emancipation entails before rushing into the process."

      "title": "Apply for emancipation in court.",
      "content": "Apply for emancipation in court. Once you have double-checked that you meet all of your country’s (or state’s) requirements for legal emancipation, submit your emancipation request at your local court. You will need to prove your financial and housing status during this process. Once the court has received your petition, serve a copy of your petition to your parents, and the judge will schedule a hearing for your case. [6] X Research source Use a bank statement to prove your financial status. The court proceedings for emancipation can take up to half a year. The exact process may vary from court to court. The court should tell you everything you need to know about the hearing, but if you have questions, don’t hesitate to ask them. Be aware that some states charge a filing fee between $150-200. The court may ask for evidence of why you want to be emancipated when you first submit your petition, or they may only require it at the hearing. Either way, gather all your evidence ahead of time and be prepared to present it."

      "title": "Try coming to an agreement with your parents or guardians first.",
      "content": "Try coming to an agreement with your parents or guardians first. If you want to move out but do not want to legally emancipate yourself, discuss your situation with your parents or guardians. Depending on the circumstances, your family may support your desire to move out and consent to you living with someone else. It may also help for you to have an idea where you would plan on staying before seriously discussing the prospect of moving out. [7] X Research source If possible, consider living or moving in with someone else. Extended isolation can negatively contribute to your physical and emotional health. [8] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Clinical psychologist Peggy Rios says if you want to prepare to move out, make sure you know how to do things that are necessary to living on your own, like “grocery shopping, doing laundry, and paying rent.” She adds that it’s best to start doing these things “several months before you move out” so you have time to figure out any questions you may have."

      "content": "Ask to stay with a family member if your parents won't let you live alone. If you have any close relatives, they may be willing to help you out, even if it’s temporary. Choose a relative who is mature and responsible so your parents will be more likely to agree to you living with them. Confirm this agreement with both your parents and the relative you’ll be moving in with. [9] X Research source For example, your parents may be more willing to let you live with your aunt than your 20-year-old cousin. In most places, it’s illegal for minors to stay with a family member without the permission of their parents or guardians."

Offer to pay your friend rent or do work around their home in exchange for living with them. Even if they only let you stay for a few weeks or months, it could still be a nice break away from home.

You definitely don’t want to enter any new living situation unprepared. Teens who run away from home are more likely to develop drug addictions or turn to criminal activity. [11] X Research source If you are thinking about running away, consider reaching out to a hotline or trusted individual to discuss your situation. [12] X Research source In most cases, it isn’t illegal to run away, but depending on where you live, your parents may file a runaway report which would allow legal authorities to return you to their care if they find you. Runaway teens can also be held in a detention center or placed on probation."
