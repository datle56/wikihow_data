However, your colon needs to be totally empty to have a colonoscopy, so you want your stools to be loose. To help you have easy bowel movements, temporarily cut out high-fiber foods like whole grains, raw fruits and vegetables, dried fruit, nuts, and seeds. Ask your doctor how much fiber you should eat. Track your fiber by writing down how much you’re eating or by entering what you eat into a nutrition app. It might help to prepare yourself a week in advance by decreasing the amount of fiber you eat and increasing foods that promote colon health, like prunes and prune juice, berries, and dark, leafy greens.
