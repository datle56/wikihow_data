      "title": "Open the windows to ventilate the inside of your home.",
      "content": "Open the windows to ventilate the inside of your home. Opening multiple windows will allow a cross breeze to develop in your home, which will help more humid air to circulate out. You don’t need to open your windows all the way; just crack them 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5.1 cm). [1] X Expert Source Victor Belavus Air Conditioning Specialist Expert Interview. 6 May 2020. Aim to open at least 2 windows on different sides of your home so the humid air can move throughout your home. If you can’t open all of your windows, prioritize opening windows in those rooms where lots of moisture tends to build up (e.g., the bathroom)."

      "title": "Turn on the air conditioner to cool down the air in your home.",
      "content": "Turn on the air conditioner to cool down the air in your home. Not only does cooling the air reduce its moisture content, but the AC will also help circulate air in your home. This is especially important during the warm summer months or during particularly humid weather. [2] X Research source For example, it may seem counterintuitive, but it’s a good idea to run your air conditioner (at least for a little while) during rainy weather."

      "title": "Run standalone fans in individual rooms to move air around.",
      "content": "Run standalone fans in individual rooms to move air around. These work particularly well in conjunction with open windows and running AC. Point the fans towards open windows so that they’re constantly pushing air outside. [3] X Expert Source Victor Belavus Air Conditioning Specialist Expert Interview. 6 May 2020. Your best bet is to go with window fans that constantly move air outside. However, if you don’t have access to this kind of system, standalone fans will work just as well."

      "title": "Replace the filters",
      "content": "Replace the filters on your air conditioning units on a regular basis. Clogged air filters will gradually make your air conditioner less efficient over time. This will translate to warmer, and therefore more humid, air in the long run. In general, replace the filter every 90 days to keep it running as smoothly as possible. [4] X Expert Source Victor Belavus Air Conditioning Specialist Expert Interview. 6 May 2020. If you have pets that shed hair, like cats or dogs, bump up this maintenance schedule and replace the filter every 60 days."

      "title": "Take shorter, colder showers to reduce the moisture in your bathroom.",
      "content": "Take shorter, colder showers to reduce the moisture in your bathroom. Bathrooms are actually the largest producers of humidity in homes, usually because of showers. By taking shorter showers, you’re significantly reducing the amount of moisture that your bathroom generates in your home. Taking colder showers also reduces humidity overall, since warm water (and warm air) tends to add more moisture to the air than cold water."

      "title": "Place houseplants outside or in a single room in your home.",
      "content": "Place houseplants outside or in a single room in your home. Plants are constantly releasing moisture vapor into the air, making them pesky contributors to indoor humidity. Moving them outside is your best bet, but if this isn’t possible, the next best thing is to keep them all in a single room. [5] X Research source You’ll need to take extra steps to dehumidify this room, such as opening the windows, keeping a fan in the room, and perhaps setting out a bowl of natural dehumidifiers."

    {
      "title": "Set out a bowl filled with alternative dehumidifiers.",
      "content": "Set out a bowl filled with alternative dehumidifiers. Baking soda, laundry detergent, charcoal, and rock salts can all be used to absorb moisture out of the surrounding air. Fill a large bowl with one of these substances and place it in a room with lots of moisture for greatest effect. [6] X Research source Refill this bowl every 2-3 days to make sure it's continually effective. There's no set amount of a dehumidifying substance that you need to put out for them to work. Aim to put out at least 1 large bowl in every room of your home. You can also buy commercial desiccants that draw moisture out of the air with calcium chloride. These can be bought at most hardware and home improvement stores."

      "title": "Run an exhaust fan in the kitchen when you’re cooking.",
      "content": "Run an exhaust fan in the kitchen when you’re cooking. This is especially important if you’re boiling water, which will produce a lot of steam. For best results, make sure the exhaust fan is oriented upwards and towards the outside of your home. [7] X Research source Whenever possible, keep a lid over what you’re cooking to limit the amount of steam and water vapor released into the air. If you can, try to avoid cooking on warm, humid days."

      "content": "Fix any leaking pipes that may be contributing to your home’s humidity. Leaking pipes can be a sneaky source of moisture in the air, especially in the bathroom and kitchen. Be on the lookout for leaky pipes and fix them as soon as possible when you notice them. [8] X Expert Source Victor Belavus Air Conditioning Specialist Expert Interview. 6 May 2020. Be sure to mop up any water that may have pooled up beneath a leaky pipe. Remember, this is where the bulk of the moisture is coming from!"
