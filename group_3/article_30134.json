      "content": "Make the handle out of a 5 to 6 ft (1.5 to 1.8 m) branch or bamboo pole. Outside, find a branch that’s 5 to 6 ft (1.5 to 1.8 m) long and at least 1 ½ in (3.8 cm) thick. You can also use a 6 ft (1.8 m) bamboo pole or an old cardboard wrapping paper tube for the handle instead. You can also make a 5 to 6 ft (1.5 to 1.8 m) long handle from cardboard. Just cut out 4 to 5 cardboard handles the same shape and size and hot glue them on top of each other. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Bundle up small twigs and cut them to the same length. Outside, find a collection of 1 to 2 ft (30.4 to 60.9 cm) long twigs no thicker than 0.5 cm to use as the broom bristles. If necessary, use scissors or snap the branches with your hands to shorten them to the same length. Line up all the ends on one side—this side will attach to the handle of the broom. [2] X Research source If you’d like your broom to have softer bristles, use floral grass or raffia instead of twigs. [3] X Research source Line up the ends on one side, and trim them until they’re around the same length. For a more pointed bristle to your broom, try to organize the twigs so that the shorter ones are on the outside and the longer ones are on the inside near the handle."

      "content": "Attach the bundle around the handle using 4 ft (1.2 m) of twine and hot glue. Add hot glue around the end of the handle where the bristles will be and attach a few of the twigs. [4] X Research source Wrap 4 ft (1.2 m) of twine around the handle loosely, adding in as many more twigs as you’d like to create a fuller look. [5] X Research source Tie the twine in a tight knot and add a dab of hot glue to keep it secure. Rotate the broom as you add twigs to make sure that your broom bristles are full and even on all sides. Alternatively, wrap and tie twine around 4 to 6 smaller bundles of twigs, then attach the bundles to the handle using hot glue. Add a few more twigs with hot glue to fill out the gaps."

      "content": "Wrap about 3 ft (91.4 cm) of twine around the bundle several times. To secure all the twigs to the handle and make the broom look really witchy, wrap about 3 ft (91.4 cm) around the bristle bundle to create a defined twine line. [6] X Research source Secure the twine by either tying a knot or adding hot glue to the ends. If you’d like the twine to be really defined around your bristle bundle, use a slightly thicker natural rope instead of twine. If you’re worried about the bundle coming loose, you can wrap about 1 ft (91.4 cm) of floral wire around the twigs before wrapping them a final time with twine."

      "content": "Attach fake berry branches or flowers for a more natural witchy look. If you’re wearing an earthy witch’s costume or you’d like a more natural, autumn look to your Halloween decor, try slipping in a couple of fake berry branches or fake orange, purple, or red flowers into your bundle of twigs. Secure them with a dab of hot glue or add them in before wrapping a final time with twine. You can also add in a few fake vines , thorn branches , or a few traditionally magical fake plants like vervain or nightshade (the real plant is poisonous, so use the fake version).

      "content": "Add in curly twigs to add texture to the end of the broom. Your broom definitely doesn’t need to look completely straight or uniform—it might even look more realistic if you add a few fake curly willow twigs or a couple of crazy knotted or twisted twigs you find in your own backyard. You can also add in fallen leaves or long yellow grass for a more earthy, textured look."

To make your broom look more like a traditional witch’s besom (a type of broom made out of twigs), wrap another layer of 3 ft (91.4 cm) long twine at least 3 in (7.6 cm) lower on the broom’s bristles than the other layer of twine. Secure the new layer with a decorative knot or a dab of hot glue."

      "content": "Spray paint the broom handle and bristles for a more neutral, unified feel. If you’d like your broom to perfectly match your house decor or the costume you have planned, use spray paint to make it any color you’d like. You can either spray paint the handle and the twigs outside before you put it together, or spray paint it afterwards—just remember to put down a drop cloth first. Use outdoor-rated spray paint if you’re planning on using your witch’s broom as an outside Halloween decoration."

If you’re not feeling the twine look, try wrapping 1 ft (30.4 cm) of purple, orange, or another colorful thick ribbon around the bundled bristles on your broom. Tie it in a decorative bow or add a dab of hot glue to secure it to the broom."
