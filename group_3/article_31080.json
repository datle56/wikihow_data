Each time Jordan walked away with a championship win, he gifted one of his sneakers to Bulls PR executive Tim Hallam. Although the sneakers are a bit worn and don’t come in pairs, this legendary collection still raked in $8 million during a Sotheby’s auction in 2024.

This pair of Bred 13s was worn in game 2 of the 1998 NBA Finals, which was Jordan’s last season as a Chicago Bulls player. Due to their pristine condition and status, this “Last Dance” pair was auctioned at Sotheby’s for $2.2 million in 2023. [3] X Research source"

He reached out to conceptual artist Matt Senna for a pair of 10s grafted exclusively out of solid gold. With a weight of 100 pounds and a price tag of $2.1 million, it makes sense why Drake doesn’t lace up and take these onto a court. [4] X Research source"

Despite Jordan battling a sickness, he still put up 38 points and dragged the Bulls to a win, with the final score sitting at a close 90-88. This game has been solidified in NBA history as a story of grit and determination, so it's no wonder that the sneakers sold for $1.38 million at a 2023 auction. [5] X Research source"

The Dunk Sole was wider and softer, so it made sense to replace the original sole with it. After being signed by Jordan, this game-worn pair sold at Heritage in February 2022 for $675,000. The owner currently has the bidding offer for this pair at $1,012,500. [6] X Research source"

After the game, he gave the pair to the opposing team captain, with a shard of glass still embedded in the outsole. This double-signed pair eventually sold at a Christie’s auction for $615,000 back in 2021, making them one of the most expensive Jordan 1s to date. [7] X Research source This pair specifically inspired the line of Shattered Backboard 1s released in the 2010s and onward, which donned the same orange, black, and white as the uniform Jordan shattered the backboard in."

Banks later gifted the pair to sportscaster and friend, Rick Lozano, who got them signed by Jordan again in an interview during the 1991 NBA Finals. He also added the notion, “1st pair,” which contributes to the pair’s $615,000 price tag. [8] X Research source"

This pair can currently fetch you a hefty price, with one currently sitting at $300,000 on the popular sneaker-selling site, GOAT.

But, the impact he’s left on the culture also holds weight, as Jordans are still priced high depending on their role in his career. [22] X Research source For example, Jordans worn in-game are expensive because Jordan had them on. Jordans that were popular choices for Jordan, like 1s and 4s, are also popular for those reasons."
