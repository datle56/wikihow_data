      "content": "Position your index finger along a fret. You don't want to use the squishiest part of your finger, but rather use the harder portion close to your thumb. [1] X Research source As you begin practicing barre chords, place your middle finger on top of your index finger, but only to familiarize yourself with the required pressure needed against the strings. [2] X Research source The eighth fret is lower in string tension. This will make an easier starting point for your fingers."

      "content": "Press your thumb against the back of the neck. Imagine holding your fingers on the neck of a guitar like you're squishing a bug. Apply pressure from both sides to get the cleanest sound. It will feel awkward at first."

      "title": "Practice the major chord.",
      "content": "Practice the major chord. This chord is played in standard tuning, as in EADGBE (the rest of the explanations for this article are also in this tuning). If you already know how to play an E major, then apply this position underneath your index finger. The position on the eighth fret is: Barre the eight fret with your index finger. Place your ring finger on the fifth string (A) on the tenth fret. Place your pinky-finger on the fourth string (D) on the tenth fret as well. Then place your middle finger on the third string (G) on the ninth fret. This will be hard at first, but know that everyone has struggled just like you are."

      "content": "Play barre chords like Jimi Hendrix. Jimi played the guitar differently than the described method above. He employed the thumb over technique. [3] X Research source What this means is that instead of barring your index finger, you can use your thumb on the lowest string. Imagine holding the guitar neck like a microphone or a drum stick. Everyone has their preferences and many people would advise against this approach, but you could say, \"this is how Hendrix played.\""

      "content": "Begin a practice routine. Before perfecting your barre chord, practice each component. Spend 10-15 minutes a day only practicing your index finger along the eighth fret. [4] X Research source Pluck each string and listen for a clear sound from each string."

      "title": "Move down to the fifth fret.",
      "content": "Move down to the fifth fret. [5] X Research source You are using the same practice of only barring your index finger, but now you're using more pressure from your finger. The fifth fret has more tension from the strings then the sixth fret. Try going for complete clarity from all strings at least 90% of the time. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Practice holding this position while moving between frets.",
      "content": "Practice holding this position while moving between frets. Remember that, as you move away from the neck, the tension of the strings will be less, so it should be slightly easier to hold."

      "content": "Practice for two weeks. If you practice these steps everyday for 15-20 minutes, you'll notice a difference within two weeks. If you're not improving, extend the duration of your practice and check on your progress after a week."

Only after strengthening your index finger into a comfortable barred form can you add other fingers to create real chords (although barring the eighth fret only is a Cm7add11). There are various chords to practice. As an example, look at this list of bar chords ."

      "content": "Explore the \"A\" barre chord. To play this, bar the third fret (or any fret now that you know how barre chords work), starting from the fifth string (A string). Place your index finger across all the stings except the low E. To play a major chord in this form, use your ring finger to barre the D, G, and B strings on the fifth fret. This is a C major."

      "content": "Learn the varieties of the \"D\" barre chord. Just like the other types of barre chords, you can start on the D string as the root. This is a less challenging barre chord, but a useful one. Practice a simple, funky sounding chord by barring the D string to the high E string, without strumming the E or A strings."
