      "content": "Pisces is the 12th (and final) sign of the zodiac. As water signs, Pisces men are typically easygoing, deeply emotional, and empathetic.

      "title": "Creative",
      "content": "Creative Their connection to Neptune, the planet of creativity and dreams, makes Pisces men exceptionally artistic—they’re one of the most imaginative zodiac signs! Pisces guys have a reputation for being quite dreamy and sometimes have their heads up in the clouds. They tend to prefer hobbies involving art and music over activities that require rigid logic. Pisces men tend to thrive in jobs and career paths that allow them to use their creativity and think outside the box. Pisces men can also be a little disorganized because strict routines aren’t their thing. They prefer to just go with the flow!"

    {
      "title": "Idealistic",
      "content": "Idealistic Pisces men look for the best in everyone! They’re natural dreamers, prone to chasing lofty goals and ideals over more practical pursuits because they’re so idealistic. Pisces guys also tend to be trusting by nature and find it easy to trust people relatively fast—but if that trust is broken, Pisces men are also prone to holding grudges (like all water signs). [2] X Research source Their idealism can make Pisces men a bit too impressionable sometimes. They can be overly trusting at times, and it’s relatively easy to get them to change their minds about things."

    {
      "title": "Intuitive",
      "content": "Intuitive As water signs, Pisces men are very intuitive. They tend to trust their gut when it comes to making big decisions and use their natural sixth sense to guide them through life. They have a natural ability to read those around them, picking up on energies and vibes that other people miss—and therefore tend to be able to understand people and events on a deeper level."
    },
    {
      "title": "Empathetic",
      "content": "Empathetic Pisces men are incredibly empathetic and sensitive to the emotions of everyone around them. They’re always ready with a shoulder to cry on, a few supportive words, or a thoughtful gesture because they love to show people how much they care. Their instinct is to provide warmth and comfort as soon as they sense someone might need it. [3] X Research source Pisces men are prone to addressing the needs of people they care about before addressing their own; this sign can sometimes be quite noble and selfless!"

    {
      "title": "Easygoing",
      "content": "Easygoing Their flexible nature as mutable signs makes Pisces men very patient, easygoing, friendly, and collaborative. Mutable signs are essentially zodiac signs that tend to welcome change and go with the flow more than others, and Pisces is a prime example! They have natural adaptability as a water sign, and their mutable modality takes them the extra mile, making them one of the easiest signs to get along with. Pisces men are super open to collaboration in the workplace. They love working with others and exchanging ideas as much as they love exercising their creativity, though they may avoid positions of leadership because of this."

    {
      "title": "Generous",
      "content": "Generous Of course dreamy, idealistic Pisces men also have an altruistic streak! They have strong nurturing instincts and love to be of service to the people they care about. That means Pisces men are generally happy to do favors for people, constantly ask how they can help and are prone to dropping everything when a friend or loved one needs help. Acts of kindness are a Pisces’ specialty. [4] X Research source However, as kind and helpful as Pisces men often are towards other people, they can have a hard time accepting help themselves. If a Pisces man feels misunderstood or is wary after someone took advantage of his kindness in the past, he may be a little closed-off and reluctant to ask for help as a way of protecting himself."

    {
      "title": "Sensitive",
      "content": "Sensitive Pisces men feel all of their emotions very deeply. As water signs, most Pisces men have a deep well of emotion within them and tend to be extremely reactive when their emotions run high. They often wear their hearts on their sleeves, have a great deal of emotional intelligence, and love to talk about their feelings (as well as others). [5] X Research source On the flip side, a Pisces man’s sensitivity can make him a little too prone to letting his emotions get the better of him. Pisces guys can get overly emotional during arguments, and it can take them a while to cheer up when they feel moody.

      "content": "He opens up to you emotionally. It’s a huge sign of affection when a Pisces man lets you see his sensitive side. Building an emotional connection is the most important part of a relationship for him, so the fact that he wants one with you means he’s attached. He’ll engage in long, meaningful talks, try to get to know you on a deeper level, and share more of his innermost thoughts and feelings with you. [6] X Trustworthy Source HelpGuide Nonprofit organization dedicated to providing free, evidence-based mental health and wellness resources. Go to source Pisces men tend to get a little bored in relationships where they aren’t connecting with their partner on a deeper level, so they really appreciate it when you ask them deep, thoughtful questions. For example, your Pisces guy loves to be asked about his feelings. Make a point to check in with him regularly and ask things like, “How are you feeling about everything?” Spirituality and dreams are also fascinating to a Pisces man; you can rarely go wrong asking him what he dreamed about or his spiritual beliefs."

Except Pisces to pull out all the stops when he wants to woo you, from romantic candlelit dinners to beautiful bouquets of flowers. This man loves sentimental displays of affection! [7] X Research source Since Pisces guys have a lot of creativity, they might also use that artistic sensibility when it comes to romance.

      "content": "He’s passionate and open-minded in the bedroom. While a Pisces man’s gentleness extends to the bedroom, he’s also very open to experimentation! Pisces’ intuition helps him pick up on his partner’s needs instinctively, and he’s so creative (and nonjudgmental) that the idea of trying new things really excites him. Intimacy is rarely dull with a sweet, adventurous Pisces man. [8] X Research source Sentimental Pisces is also fond of cuddling (and kissing) their partner. Sex is all well and good, but Pisces also dreams of having a profound emotional connection with their sexual partner. Pisces men are particularly great at role-playing when it comes to intimacy—after all, a sign associated with imagination and fantasy is bound to have acting chops."

Pisces isn’t a super solitary sign, but they do have a tendency to get moody sometimes—and when Pisces guys are in a mood, solo time can help them unwind. You might find that your Pisces man detaches for a bit while he sorts his emotions out, then reappears when he’s feeling more like himself. [9] X Research source"

      "content": "Be sensitive and compassionate towards him. Because they’re so sensitive and empathetic, Pisces guys tend to be a bit of an emotional rollercoaster at times! They really need a partner who can empathize with them in return and show them plenty of care and compassion. Let your Pisces man know his feelings are valid, and you’ll always be there to listen when he needs to share! At the end of the day, your Pisces man doesn’t necessarily need you to be as emotive and sensitive as he is; he just needs to know that you can respect and relate to the things he feels. Having a sounding board and a sympathetic ear to vent to will mean the world to your Pisces man."

      "content": "Explore your creative side with your Pisces guy. An Imaginative Pisces man will love having a partner who is just as in touch with their creative instincts as he is! You don’t need to be an experienced artist or a master of your craft by any means; it’s more important that you simply show him you aren’t afraid to think outside the box and be creative , whatever that means for you. For example, if you know how to play an instrument, show him some of the music you’ve been working on or put on a mini-concert for him. If you like to paint, show him a few of your works. Even if you’re not a traditional artist, things like philosophy and spirituality appeal to Pisces, so don’t be afraid to bring up some of your ideas and ask about his too."

      "content": "Boost his self-esteem with compliments and support. Pisces guys can get a little negative sometimes, and self-confidence isn’t always their strong suit—which is why your vocal support can really mean the world to them. Offer a sincere compliment and let him know that you’re always in his corner when he needs someone to back him up. [10] X Research source For example, you could say something like, “You look amazing today! Then again, you always do,” or “I love the way your mind works. You’re so creative!” Try not to give him a compliment that sounds forced—Pisces men are good at picking up on subtle cues and may realize what’s going on. Rather, be as genuine as possible! Reader Poll: We asked 818 wikiHow readers Pisces, and 54% of them said that the compliment they’d most like to receive would be something sweet about their personality, like: \"You have a great heart.\" [Take Poll]"

      "content": "Invite him to go on fun and thought-provoking dates. What’s a Pisces man’s idea of a perfect date? Well, he’ll like a lot of different things but tends to gravitate towards activities involving water! If that’s not your thing (or the local beach is closed), try something artistic or imaginative that the two of you can chat about afterward. For a water-themed date, you could bring your Pisces to the aquarium, hit up the beach for some swimming, or go on a picnic by a nearby river or pond. If you’d prefer a more thought-provoking date, suggest something like an art museum or an indie movie screening."

      "content": "Give him sentimental, handmade gifts to melt his heart. Big, expensive things aren’t really what a Pisces guy is interested in getting as a gift when something special you made yourself would be so much more valuable to him! As one of the most sentimental, emotional zodiac signs, Pisces men like gifts that reflect how much you care for them—so be sure to do something special for them. [11] X Research source For example, a Pisces guy would love something homemade, like a decorated picture frame with a picture of you two in it or a cake made and personalized by you."

      "title": "Pisces men are most compatible with Cancer and Scorpio.",
      "content": "Pisces men are most compatible with Cancer and Scorpio. Water signs like Cancer and Scorpio pair beautifully with Pisces because all three have deeply emotional natures and will understand one another intuitively. Pisces men often look for devoted relationships with a strong emotional connection—which is exactly what they’ll get with a fellow water sign. [12] X Research source Cancer’s nurturing instincts are even stronger than Pisces’ (which is really saying something!) Together, this loving pair will always make sure the other feels taken care of. Scorpio’s brooding intensity is super alluring to Pisces, and the emotional intensity hidden behind Scorpio’s mysteriousness is exactly what Pisces wants from a partner. Pisces and Pisces can also be solid matches, though they may need to put more effort into defining and committing to the relationship—two Pisces can be a little wishy-washy."

      "title": "Pisces men are also super compatible with all 3 earth signs.",
      "content": "Pisces men are also super compatible with all 3 earth signs. Capricorn, Taurus, and Virgo are fantastic matches for Pisces guys. As earth signs, they can balance out dreamy Pisces with their practicality and reliability, helping him feel a little more grounded. Pisces will adore the sense of stability and commitment he’ll get from a loyal earth sign! Virgo and Pisces, in particular, are opposite one another on the zodiac wheel, so they’ll have natural “opposites attract” chemistry from the moment they meet! Pisces and Taurus will have a sweet, sensual relationship. Taurus is a little reserved on the surface but deeply passionate and loving at their core, which Pisces will love. Capricorn is an incredibly driven sign; where imaginative Pisces can get a little lost in space or unmotivated at times, Capricorn can pick up the slack and encourage Pisces to reach for the stars."

      "title": "Pisces men tend to be least compatible with air and fire signs.",
      "content": "Pisces men tend to be least compatible with air and fire signs. Air signs like Aquarius and Gemini are so different from Pisces most of the time. Gemini can be very flighty, which might make Pisces feel insecure, while Aquarius tends to be fairly unemotional, which Pisces might struggle to relate to. Fire signs like Aries and Leo can clash with Pisces since they tend to be more aggressive and straightforward than the gentle, sensitive water sign. Of all the air signs, Libra can actually be a decent match with Pisces because both are very romantic and open-minded. If Libra can open up emotionally to Pisces, they’ll deeply enjoy one another’s company. Of the fire signs, Sagittarius can match well with Pisces because they share a ruling planet (Jupiter), and both crave freedom. They’ll have no problem giving one another space and will love discussing their grand ideals together."
