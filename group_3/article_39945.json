      "content": "Choose a smoker. Meat smoking experts like to say that all you need to smoke meat is a hole in the ground. While that may be true, using equipment designed for smoking will make the process go a lot smoother and give you more reliable results. If you want to give smoking a try, but aren't sure if you'll do it more than once, you can use your charcoal grill to smoke meat. [1] X Research source Otherwise, consider investing in one of the following types of smokers: [2] X Research source A wood smoker. Wood smokers are known to produce the most flavorful results. They are fueled by hardwood blocks and chips, which impart their strong flavor to the meat you're smoking. Wood smokers can be tricky to use, though, because it's necessary to monitor them carefully and keep feeding them wood to keep the temperature steady. A charcoal smoker. This is a great choice for both beginners and experts. Charcoal smokers are fueled by a mixture of charcoal and wood. Charcoal burns longer and steadier than wood, so charcoal smokers are easier to use than wood smokers. You can create a charcoal smoker out of your backyard grill if need be. A gas smoker. These are easy to use—you don't have to monitor the temperature all day long—but the final product won't have as much flavor as meat smoked in a charcoal or wood smoker. Most BBQ chefs agree that a gas smoker creates a better flavor than an electric smoker, however. An electric smoker. With an electric smoker, you can put the meat inside, turn it on, and forget about it until the meat's done hours later. However, electric smokers won’t create as rich a flavor as other types, and they also tend to be pretty expensive."

      "title": "Decide what type of wood to use.",
      "content": "Decide what type of wood to use. Meat can be smoked with a variety of different hardwoods, all of which impart a unique flavor to the meat. Some are stronger than others, and some pair better with certain types of meat. You can mix different types of wood that have properties you like. Depending on what kind of smoker you're using, you'll either need enough wood to burn all day long, or just enough to flavor the meat while charcoal, gas or electricity does the work. Choose from these options: [3] X Research source Mesquite will give your meat a delicious but very strong smoky flavor. [4] X Research source If you want to use only mesquite, use it with smaller cuts that won't have a very long cooking time. For bigger cuts that will require all-day cooking, mix mesquite with a milder type of wood. Hickory has a strong flavor that pairs best with red meat. Oak is good for cooking big cuts of red meat that need to smoke all day long, because its flavor is more subtle than that of mesquite or hickory. Cherry is a great complement for beef or pork. Apple wood has a sweet taste that's delicious with pork or poultry, and you can use it to smoke fish, too. Maple is another sweet wood that pairs well with pork or poultry. Alder is light and sweet, perfect for poultry or fish."

      "content": "Use the wet smoking method for more temperature control. Water can be used to help control the temperature inside a smoker while the meat is cooking. In fact, some smokers are called \"water smokers,\" and they're designed to incorporate water into the process. But you can smoke using water in a charcoal or wood smoker, too. All you have to do is put a pan of water inside the smoker and make sure it stays full throughout the day. [5] X Research source Water smoking can help regulate the temperature when you're smoking a big cut of meat that will need to cook for many hours. For smaller cuts of meat that don't have a long cooking time, it's not necessary to use water. If you purchase a smoker, read the instructions before you decide to use water. Some smokers have a built-in water tray, while others will require you to add your own tray."

      "title": "Soak wood chips, but leave bigger pieces dry.",
      "content": "Soak wood chips, but leave bigger pieces dry. If you're working with a small charcoal grill or another type of smoker where you're not actually using the wood as fuel, you can use wood chips instead of big pieces. Since chips tend to burn up quickly, they need to be soaked in water so they last longer. Soak the chips for at least an hour, then wrap them in aluminum foil. Poke holes in the top so the smoke can get out. [6] X Research source Bigger pieces, such as chunks and logs, can be left dry."

      "title": "Follow the directions that came with your smoker to get it ready.",
      "content": "Follow the directions that came with your smoker to get it ready. Each smoker has different specifications as to how to get it ready to start smoking the meat. If you're using wood or charcoal as fuel, light up your materials in the grill and wait until they burn down and are no longer producing flames. Don’t place the meat directly over high heat; rather, push the coals aside so the meat cooks low and slow over indirect heat. Throughout the cooking process, you'll add more coals and wood to keep the smoker going. [7] X Research source The goal is to keep the smoker in the range of 200–220 °F (93–104 °C) the whole time. If you have an electric or gas smoker, all you need to do is turn it on according to the manufacturer's instructions. Place your wood chips or pieces where they belong in the smoker—again, check the instructions to make sure you do it properly. You might want to invest in a thermometer you can keep inside the smoker to monitor the temperature."

      "title": "Choose a type of meat to smoke.",
      "content": "Choose a type of meat to smoke. The smoking technique can be used on any type of meat, but it's usually best for tough cuts that need a long, slow cooking time. The slow cooking process breaks down the fat and connective tissue so that the meat becomes extremely tender. You also want to choose meat that will taste good with a smoky flavor. Here are a few types of meat that taste great smoked: [8] X Research source Pork, especially ribs and shoulders. Beef, particularly briskets and ribs. Game meats, such as venison or boar. Oily fish, like trout, salmon, or mackerel. Poultry, such as whole chicken or turkey. [9] X Research source However, keep in mind that poultry skin doesn’t always hold up well to prolonged smoking, and you might need to take it off before you eat the meat if it becomes too charred."

Go to source Soak your meat in the brine overnight or for at least 8 hours in the refrigerator. Remove the meat from the refrigerator and bring it to room temperature before you begin the cooking process. [12] X Research source To make a basic brine, use 4 tablespoons (70 g) of salt per 1 US quart (0.95 L) of water. Add extra seasonings to taste, such as garlic, pepper, rosemary, lemon rind, ginger, or sugar. [13] X Research source If you’re cooking a cut of beef, such as a brisket, you can also marinate it to add flavor and tenderize the meat, but that is completely optional. A marinade is similar to a brine, but it contains acidic ingredients, such as lemon juice or vinegar."

      "title": "Bring the meat to room temperature before you smoke it.",
      "content": "Bring the meat to room temperature before you smoke it. This is an important step to take before you begin smoking any type of meat. It will ensure that the meat cooks evenly and reaches the right internal temperature by the end of the cooking process. Depending on how large your cut of meat is, set it out on the counter about 1/2 hour to 2 hours before you begin smoking it. [15] X Research source A thinner cut of meat, like a steak, won’t need as much time to warm up. 20-30 minutes is probably enough. For a larger piece of meat, like a big roast, a time closer to 2 hours may be more effective—but don’t sweat it if you can’t wait that long. To prevent the growth of dangerous bacteria, never leave meat sitting out for longer than 2 hours, and try to keep it in a relatively cool location. Don’t leave the meat sitting outside or in a hot room—e.g., where it’s over 90 °F (32 °C)—for longer than 1 hour. [16] X Research source"

      "title": "Calculate your cooking time.",
      "content": "Calculate your cooking time. The length of time it will take to completely cook your meat is determined by the heat of the grill, the type of meat, and the size of meat cut. In most cases, plan on at least 6-8 hours of cooking time—and sometimes many more. Check your recipe to determine about how long your meat will need to smoke. [17] X Research source Check your meat about 4 hours in to see if it’s done. If the meat is still firm, it needs to cook longer—smoked meat should be a bit limp and soft (but not falling apart at the touch) by the time it’s done. [18] X Research source Pork and beef ribs typically take up to 8 hours, while a big cut of brisket could take around 20. It's very important to look at your recipe to figure out how long your meat might cook, so you can plan ahead. Some smaller or more delicate cuts of meat, such as fish, may cook in a much shorter time—e.g., in 1-3 hours."

      "title": "Place the meat inside the smoker.",
      "content": "Place the meat inside the smoker. Depending on the type of smoker you’re using, you can either place it directly on the grill or put it in a shallow aluminum tray. Don't wrap the meat in foil, though, because this won't allow the smoke to touch the meat. You want it to be able to surround the meat during the cooking process. The positioning of the meat will be different according to what you're cooking. If you're making a smoked brisket, for example, place the meat side down and keep the fat side up. Be sure the meat isn't over direct heat. As mentioned, if you're using your grill as a smoker, the hot coals should be scooted to the side of the grill so that the meat won't cook too quickly.

      "title": "Baste the meat if necessary.",
      "content": "Baste the meat if necessary. Again, depending on what you're cooking, you might want to baste the meat to keep it moist throughout the cooking process. This technique is a popular choice for poultry, brisket, and ribs. Read the recipe you're using to decide if basting is necessary. If you cook your meat low and slow, it should come out moist and tender whether you baste it or not. To baste your meat, brush on your favorite marinade or sauce with a barbeque brush or mop. [20] X Research source For safety, use separate batches of marinade for your initial soak and for basting your meat as it cooks. Don’t baste your partially cooked meat with a brush or mop that’s been used on raw meat."

Some smoking recipes follow a \"3-2-1\" process: the meat smokes for the first 3 hours, then you cover it with foil for the next 2 hours, and finish it uncovered in the last hour. [21] X Research source The smoke flavor infuses the meat first, then the meat warms up internally during the second 2 hours, and finally develops a nice thick crust to finish.

      "title": "Check for the smoke ring.",
      "content": "Check for the smoke ring. During the smoking process, a pink ring will form just underneath the delicious outer crust of the meat. [23] X Research source This is a result of a chemical reaction that happens when the smoke infuses the meat; the pink color is caused by the formation of nitric acid. [24] X Research source When you cut into your meat and see a pink smoke ring, you'll know that you smoked it right. If you use the color of meat to check its doneness, the smoke ring can be a little misleading. If you’re not sure whether you’re seeing a smoke ring or underdone meat, use a meat thermometer to check the internal temperature at the thickest part of the meat. A smoke ring can appear on most meats, including beef, pork, and poultry (such as chicken or turkey). You’re less likely to notice it in smoked fish."
