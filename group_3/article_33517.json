      "content": "Choose alternates for Saber, if needed. While Saber is the first assassin many gravitate towards when they need to be a jungler per situation, it's uncommon to see him banned in ranked games. However, to emulate similar Charge skills, use Kadita, Martis, or Dyrroth - or if you want to finish off heroes, select Natalia, Yi Sun-shin, or Fanny ."

      "content": "Note his Passive (Enemy's Bane). Upon an enemy getting hit with Saber's skills/basic attacks, their physical defense will be reduced by 8 each time, while the effect can stack up to 5 times. [1] X Research source This may not be an important passive, but it can easily be activated through most of the game. Use Orbiting Swords to gain max stacks and use the passive to your advantage against creeps when jungling. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Use his First Skill (Orbiting Swords).",
      "content": "Use his First Skill (Orbiting Swords). For five seconds, Saber will launch five swords that will spin around him. When time is up, the swords return to him. During the duration, Saber's basic attack can be enhanced, and one of his swords will attack with Saber and deal extra (up to 260) physical damage. Additionally, any hero/minion/creep hit by the orbiting swords will be dealt physical damage, too. [3] X Research source While the swords fly, use the enhanced basic attack to your advantage. One hit will decrease the cooldown of Charge by one second, which can be perfect to recharge before you attack enemies. When choosing which skill to max out, prioritize this skill since this is his main damage output. Attacking turrets while this skill is active will continue to decrease the cooldown of Charge, but will not deal extra damage. [4] X Research source Even if killed, the swords will continue to fly around Saber and will return after the five seconds are up."

      "content": "Dash with mobility with his Second Skill (Charge). While it is simply Saber dashing in one direction, he will also be able to enhance his next basic attack. The enhanced basic attack will slow enemies down for one second while dealing up to 150 physical damage. Furthermore, you can also deal physical damage if you opt to pass by enemies with Charge. [5] X Research source When jungling, you can use this skill to speed up the process of killing creeps. You can also use Charge to pass through walls when escaping from enemies."

      "content": "Knock enemies airborne with his Ultimate (Triple Sweep). Saber charges at the targeted enemy, knocking them airborne for 1.2 seconds while dealing up to 540 physical damage. [6] X Research source When used right, Saber can deal more than 540 physical damage if you opt to use Orbiting Swords before Triple Sweep, since the damage combos together. Even when the enemy tries to remove its airborne effect, damage will still be given if in range. Be careful with using Triple Sweep. If you die while the skill is being channeled, you won't give out extra damage, but the enemy will remain airborne. Turn on Hero Lock Mode to make sure you get your intended target."

      "title": "Buy equipment for Saber.",
      "content": "Buy equipment for Saber. Saber is usually a jungler, so it is best to choose Tough Boots (to reduce Crowd Control duration) and the Ice Retribution pairing to start. After this, prioritize Blade of the Heptaseas, Hunter Strike, Blade of Despair, and Malefic Roar to increase his damage output. For the last equipment slot, choose either Immortality if you want to improve on Saber's durability, Sea Halberd to lower lifesteal for enemies, Rose Gold Meteor to have a small boost on mages, or Sky Piercer to quickly kill heroes.

      "content": "Choose his emblem. Since Saber is an Assassin, it's more than logical to select the Assassin emblem to maximize his potential. Choose Rupture in the first tier to increase his adaptive penetration, followed by Weapons Master from the Marksman emblem to further enhance his physical damage from equipment. Lastly, complete the emblem with Lethal Injection in the last tier to deal a slow burn to enemies if they happen to survive after you intervene. [8] X Research source"

      "title": "Try out combos for Saber.",
      "content": "Try out combos for Saber. Of course, the most recognizable combo for Saber is 1st - 2nd - Ult - Basic Attack. First, initiate with Orbiting Swords and Charge at the same time while locking in on an enemy. Then, use Triple Sweep to finish your intended target. If they happen to survive, use your enhanced basic attack from Charge to kill them. While this skill can be used anywhere, Saber players tend to launch this combo when hiding in a bush to ambush squishy heroes. Alternatively, you can try using 1st - 2nd early on. Start with Orbiting Swords and use Charge at the end. This combo can be used to jungle against creeps or get an early edge on enemies."
