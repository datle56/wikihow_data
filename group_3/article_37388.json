      "content": "Make the conversation playful with a little competition. When he sends you a flirty text, you know he’s into you ! Teasing him a little will keep him guessing about whether or not you feel the same way. Keep him on his toes to build the attraction. [1] X Research source If he compliments something you’re good at, build a little friendly competition. For example, “You seem pretty good at soccer, too... But you’ve never gone up against me.” If he compliments one of your physical qualities, compliment one of his in return, but add a bit of a challenge. “Well you seem pretty strong. But I still bet I’d win in a pushup contest.” or “You’re cute, too. But I don’t like guys who’re cuter than me.” Pick something he likes that’s not super heavy or emotionally loaded. Then add, “That’s why we could never date” along with a winky emoji. For instance, “You like quinoa? That’s why we could never date.” Hint that you know a secret about him. For example, “I think I know somebody that might have a crush on you?!” [2] X Research source Reader Poll: We asked 154 wikiHow readers if they think lightly teasing someone is an effective way to flirt, and 84% said yes .

Whether he’s coming on really strong or sending unwanted sexual content, you can still keep the vibe open to potential flirting while shutting down anything gross. Soften any of these texts by adding a winky emoji so he knows you’re joking. Take a look at these texts to keep him in check: If he texts “I wanna see you” or “When can I see you?” reply “Go on my Instagram.” [5] X Research source If he texts “tell me how you want me,” send something outrageously practical like “Financially responsible with a doctorate in astrophysics and a brand new SUV.” If he sends a text that says “Thinking of you…” or “I miss you…” respond with something confident like, “Well duh.” [6] X Research source If he says “say something hot,” respond with “a tea kettle.” If he says “are you single?” respond “No, I’m plural.” If he asks for a “dirty pic,” send him a photo of your dirty dishes."

Then, hold off on finishing the story to get him interested in talking to you more. [10] X Research source The idea isn’t just to be super mysterious, but rather to give him a reason to talk to you over the phone or in person, rather than just through texts. [11] X Research source If he tells you how good you look in a photo on social media, say “Yeah… that was a crazy night!” then add “I’ll tell you about it if you’re lucky.” If you’re not sure how to reply to a flirty text, use a cliffhanger to buy yourself time, “The wildest thing just happened… I’ll tell you later.” Use this strategy to casually suggest meeting up, “It’s a long story. I’d have to tell you in person.”"

Just don’t send explicit photos unless you two have agreed you’re both okay with that.

[20] X Research source If he asks what you’re up to, try, “Changing into something hot before I head out with the girls/boys.” If you respond late, you can say, “Sorry I didn’t see this. I just got out of the shower.” When he asks what you’re doing in the evening say, “Just got home from work.

I know you're going to meet someone special, but I just don't think that we're a match.” If you’re uncomfortable, end the conversation or change the subject: “Hey, that makes me a little uncomfortable.
