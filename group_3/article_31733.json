      "content": "Choose a niche for your sandwich shop. Think about ways you can separate your potential business from other franchises and shops in your community. Check online to see what kinds of shops are already open in your area, as this can help you narrow down your possible niche. Since this business will be your full-time job, try to pick out a niche that you genuinely like. For instance, if there are a lot of sub shops in your area, you might want to focus on selling clubs or diner-style sandwiches."

      "title": "Purchase a franchise shop if you don’t want to start from scratch.",
      "content": "Purchase a franchise shop if you don’t want to start from scratch. Note that some large sandwich chains allow entrepreneurs to purchase individual stores. Buying a store from an established chain helps get rid of some legal bells and whistles, but is still a big investment. Compare the costs of popular franchises to see if this is a realistic option for your business goals. [1] X Research source Some franchise stores cost several hundred thousand dollars to own and run, which costs more than starting your own business from scratch. For instance, it costs at least $84,000 to start a Subway store, and over $325,000 to start a Jimmy John’s Gourmet Sandwiches store. [2] X Research source"

Keep in mind that you’ll need around $60,000 to get your own sandwich shop up and running, while still having enough money to pay for your regular bills. Think about how much you’re willing to risk to get your shop off the ground, or if you’re comfortable with asking for a large loan. [3] X Research source If you’d like to save money, see if you can find any interested friends or family members to join you in starting your own business."

      "content": "Buy or rent a location for your shop that gets a lot of foot traffic. Search your local area for properties with open leases available, like shopping centers or strip malls. Look specifically for areas that get a lot of exposure and foot traffic, as this will help you make a bigger profit. Ideally, look for vacant spaces that are near train stations, airports, or other busy areas where there will be a lot of people milling around. [4] X Research source If you choose a location in the middle of nowhere, you won’t make as much money."

      "content": "Pick a name for your shop if you aren’t opening a franchise store. Think of something simple but catchy to name your shop, so customers know exactly what to expect. Play around with alliteration, or use a play on words instead. Draft a list of different name ideas until you find one that you really like! [5] X Trustworthy Source U.S. Small Business Administration U.S. government agency focused on supporting small businesses Go to source For instance, you can name your shop something “Denise’s Deli” or “Fresh Meats, Eats, and Treats.” Once you think of a business name, register or trademark the name so your name is legally protected."

Draft out the full details of how you plan on running and managing your store, so potential investors can get an idea of what you’re trying to do. [6] X Research source Generally, a business plan starts with an executive summary, then includes a company description, market analysis, organizational structure, a section on products and services, a discussion on marketing and sales, funding requests, and an appendix. Double-check your document to make sure there are no errors. Your funding request needs to include everything you’ll need to keep your shop up and running. This includes items like industrial appliances, cabinets, uniforms, paper supplies, cups, food prep tools, bread, meats, toppings, employee wages, and more."

While you don’t have to use a registered agent for this part of the process, doing so can save you a lot of time and stress down the line. Before you submit your request, decide if you want to be an LLC, corporation, or limited partnership. [8] X Trustworthy Source U.S. Small Business Administration U.S. government agency focused on supporting small businesses Go to source An LLC is probably the best option for a small business, like a sandwich shop you’re opening up on your own. If you’re opening your shop with someone else, consider registering as a limited partnership instead. If you’re registering as an LLC, you’ll need to submit different articles of organization as well as an LLC operating agreement. If you’re registering as a limited partnership, you’ll need an official certificate and a written agreement."
