      "content": "A Sag man will loosen up his Taurus partner. Ruled by happy-go-lucky planet Jupiter, Sagittarius is the definition of easy, breezy, beautiful . [1] X Research source On the other hand, Taurus is a fixed sign, so she might be a little more bound to routine. [2] X Research source If things go well, a Sagittarius man will drag Taurus on gorgeous, spur-of-the-moment adventures, which will deepen their bond and leave Taurus feeling totally alive. In short: he’ll be like a breath of fresh air to her. Taurus, be sure to let Sag’s sunny nature rub off on you. You might be surprised by how much you enjoy going with the flow—as long as you have a friendly face to guide you through! Sagittarius, do bring Taurus out of her shell, but do it gradually. Maybe start with a surprise date night before you graduate to full-on, spontaneous weekend vacations!"

      "title": "Taurus shows Sag the benefit of settling down.",
      "content": "Taurus shows Sag the benefit of settling down. Taurus knows how to commit to someone she truly loves. For Sag, though, serious relationships are spooky. But through example and her steady nature, Taurus can show Sagittarius how comforting, beautiful, and meaningful these deeper connections can be. In time, Sag might start to realize that even though it’s scary, he’d been craving that kind of devoted romance. Our advice? Sagittarius, be brave! No one’s saying you have to get married tomorrow, but don’t run from something before you’ve given it a shot. You might end up missing out on the relationship of your dreams. Taurus, if your Sagittarius crush is flirty with others while you’re getting to know him, don’t bolt right away. To him, flirting doesn’t always mean anything serious—give him a chance to prove that you’re his favorite!"

      "title": "Neither partner will rush their romance without giving it some thought.",
      "content": "Neither partner will rush their romance without giving it some thought. Sagittarius and Taurus, for totally different reasons, will take things slow at the start. Sag is afraid of getting tied down, and Taurus is so serious that she won’t commit unless she's 100% sure. This actually allows both partners to move at the same pace, which leaves less room for miscommunication and misalignment early on. Taurus, it’s likely that you’ll be the one to start the “What are we?” discussion. You probably hate romantic gray areas, but if Sag isn’t sure, try to give him time to think. Not everyone is as decisive as you are! Sagittarius, you’d probably stay in the “causal” phase of dating forever if given the opportunity. But if a Taurus brings up commitment, she means business. You’ll have to decide to take the plunge, or say goodbye."

      "title": "Their differences can be mysterious and intoxicating.",
      "content": "Their differences can be mysterious and intoxicating. Sagittarius and Taurus are very, very different people—but opposites can attract. Sagittarius and Taurus will surprise each other constantly, and they’ll never be bored. Sagittarius will marvel at Taurus’ certainty and sensuality; Taurus will be in awe of Sag’s free-spirited, magnetic personality. Will these differences cause tension, too? Maybe, but it’ll also make things exciting. Both partners should focus on admiring and appreciating these differences. When your partner does something you didn’t expect, be sure to frame it positively. With a little extra attention, “Why did she do that?” can easily turn into, “It’s so exciting to be around someone who surprises me. I’m glad that I’m not with someone boring!”"

      "title": "Both signs are intuitive and understanding, making them great partners.",
      "content": "Both signs are intuitive and understanding, making them great partners. In different ways, Taurus and Sagittarius just know what’s up. Sagittarius is socially intuitive, and ultimately, a good-natured person who wants the best for his connections. Taurus, on the other hand, has a talent for stability and peace, and in romance, she’ll know how to find and create an equilibrium that keeps her partner on his feet. In relationships, showing appreciation is huge. They'll have to try to intentionally notice and compliment their partner's sweet gestures, because Taurus and Sag will show love in very different ways. Taurus might take out the trash, hug you when most need it but least expect it, or remain cool and collected, even when you’re super upset. Sag might make a joke to relieve your tension, compliment you in a crowd to make you feel special, or take you on an adventure when you need inspiration."

      "content": "Sagittarius might be frustrated with Taurus’ reliance on routines. If they're not careful and flexible with each other, Sagittarius might start to feel bound and bored by Taurus’ need for consistency. [3] X Research source Every time Sag wants an adventure (but Taurus refuses to leave home), that discontent can build—eventually, Sagittarius might feel like he's losing an important part of himself. Taurus, look for chances to compromise. You love the outdoors—if Sag is feeling antsy, why not suggest a sunny mountain hike that you both can enjoy? Sagittarius, be clear about how important adventure is to your happiness. At first, she might not get that these aren’t silly antics, but an important part of your personality."

      "title": "Taurus might wish Sagittarius would slow down, relax, and indulge.",
      "content": "Taurus might wish Sagittarius would slow down, relax, and indulge. A Taurus’ preferred state is cuddling, and though Sagittarius usually loves physical affection, he probably won’t want to lay in bed for hours of the day. But getting close, relaxing, and enjoying life’s luxuries together: to Taurus, there’s nothing better. [4] X Research source If Sagittarius isn’t able to slow down and throw Taurus a bone, it could be a source of tension. Sagittarius, you’re not super into schedules, and sometimes time gets away from you. Try setting one night a week where you promise to let her choose the activity. And make sure you keep your word! Taurus, if you want a slow night in, do the planning. Cook a nice meal, light some candles. Sag is mutable, so he likes to go with the flow. If you do the heavy lifting, he'll be more likely to join in!x"

      "title": "Taurus and Sag's romantic philosophies might feel at odds.",
      "content": "Taurus and Sag's romantic philosophies might feel at odds. Taurus is a serious, devoted partner at heart; Sagittarius is all about flings and fun. When it’s finally time to define the relationship, there’s a chance that things will fizzle. Sagittarius might push to leave things without a label, but Taurus rarely compromises on her needs in love. Taurus, if Sag hasn’t made up his mind, give him a deadline—but a generous one. This’ll give him enough time to consider, while allowing you your peace of mind. Sag, if you feel the urge to bolt, try to decide: am I feeling fear or is this not what I want? If you’re afraid, talk to Taurus and try to commit . If it’s truly not what you want, then let Taurus know. Ultimately though, Sagittarius is fully capable of being a full-on, loving partner when he does choose to commit. If they get past this tricky phase together, it should be smooth sailing!"

      "content": "Taurus is more romantic than Sag, but in love, they'll find a way. Taurus will be all about sweet, major gestures: moonlit dates, packed picnic baskets, a bouquet of roses for Valentine’s Day. To Sagittarius, though, true romance is a shared laugh or a wild night of passion. For these two to get on the same page emotionally, communication and compromise will be key. Taurus and Sagittarius, when you like something your partner does, say so. This can help the two of you better understand how to connect with the other, without it sounding like you’re criticizing each other’s natural romantic instincts. Try to meet in the middle. If you know what your partner likes, make an effort. Sagittarius, try planning a super romantic date night. Taurus, when you do something silly that makes Sag laugh, make note of it (so you can bring back the bit when Sag is feeling down)."

      "content": "These two will have serious chemistry as long as they communicate. Taurus and Sagittarius are some of the spiciest signs in bed. Because she's ruled by Venus, Taurus will be super sensual (and she’ll know just how to touch him). Sagittarius, on the other hand, is a fire sign who’s full of passion, so he’ll make sure that there’s never a dull moment. That said, their tastes may differ just a little bit—she might lean more towards romance, whereas he wants to experiment with new things. Communication will be super important here. Be open about your desires and boundaries, and never judge your partner for what they like. As long as you’re on the same page, you two are sure to have a lot of fun together!"

      "content": "Sag says what’s on his mind, but Taurus will need time to think. As we’ve mentioned, communication will be super important between these two—but healthy dialogue might take some work to achieve. Sagittarius says everything that’s on his mind without a second thought. He's the definition of an “open book.” Taurus, though, needs to think long and hard about her words before she can have a conversation. Sagittarius, say your piece, but don’t expect Taurus to respond with the same speed. If she says she needs time, trust her—and don’t pressure her to open up before she’s ready. Taurus, ask Sagittarius to summarize his thoughts for you if you get stuck. You take other’s words seriously, but Sagittarius might not always say exactly what he means."

      "content": "Ultimately, both partners want love, adventure, and a stable home. Though Sagittarius and Taurus’ relationship will be defined by their differences at the outset, down the line, they’re likely to align well. Once they settle into a rhythm, they’ll both do their part to create a loving home and a sparkling relationship. These two are curious and hard working, which will create room for deeper connection. They’re the couple who: Spends the weekend hiking and camping in the most gorgeous, secret natural hideaways. Finishes exciting, eccentric home projects together, like a homemade canoe or a new greenhouse. Ditches the party early to go look for shooting stars under the moonlight."

      "content": "In a Sag man and Taurus woman romance, opposites will attract. Though their natural instincts clash, their hearts beat to the same drum. Taurus and Sagittarius can have an amazing relationship, driven by mystery, love, and surprise. Communication, appreciation, and compromise will be key—that way, they can ensure that the divide between them doesn’t grow too big to cross. Sagittarius and Taurus will probably enjoy each other in the beginning, but they might struggle to get past the “What are we?” phase. But if they can move into a committed romance, they’re likely to find true love in each other."
