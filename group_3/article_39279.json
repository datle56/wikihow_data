      "content": "Spread out any denim item on a flat surface. Blue jeans, a jean jacket, or a denim accessory will all work. Sit down at a table or desk and spread the denim out in front of you on your work surface. [1] X Research source This will work with any kind of razor blade. However, it might be a slightly inefficient way of sharpening a straight razor. For safety, eyebrow, and disposable razors though, this will get the job done. This shouldn't ruin the denim. However, there’s always a chance that you could tear the material, so don’t use your favorite pair of jeans here!"

      "title": "Drag the edge of the blade backward against the denim.",
      "content": "Drag the edge of the blade backward against the denim. When you shave, you normally drag the sharp edge of the blade down. Here, hold the blade against the denim but drag it up against the material at a roughly 15- to 25-degree angle, like you’re shaving backward. Drag the edge of the blade 6–10 inches (15–25 cm) using a light but firm amount of pressure, and lift it off of the surface. [2] X Research source The denim is just rough enough that it will smooth out impurities or knicks in the blade, but not so tough that it’s going to wear too much material away."

      "title": "Repeat this motion 15-20 times to refresh your razor blade.",
      "content": "Repeat this motion 15-20 times to refresh your razor blade. Continue setting the blade against the denim, dragging it, and lifting it back up. Use quick, decisive strokes. When you’re done, your blade should cut like new! [3] X Research source If you’re sharpening a straight razor, eyebrow razor, or safety razor, flip your razor over when you’re done and repeat the process on the other side of the blade. You might see some additional benefit by rotating the denim around every 5-6 strokes. This way, the razor drags against a variety of different denim grains/textures, which may help sharpen it."

      "title": "Lay out a razor strop or whetstone.",
      "content": "Lay out a razor strop or whetstone. A strop is a thick piece of leather used to sharpen the blades of straight-edge razors. There are hanging strops (leather with handles at each end), loom strops (leather wrapped in a loop around wood), or paddle strops (leather attached to a block of wood). Purchase a strop and lay it out on a flat, stable surface. You can also do this with a whetstone , if you prefer. [4] X Expert Source Woody Lovell Professional Barber [v161245_b01] 28 January 2020. Whetstones are also known as a sharpening stones. This process is the exact same if you’re using a whetstone or sharpening stone—just soak a whetstone in water before using it. [5] X Expert Source Woody Lovell Professional Barber [v161245_b01] 28 January 2020. This will work with any kind of razor, although it’s an especially efficient way to sharpen straight razors and eyebrow razors. It will totally work with a disposable razor, though. A strop is literally just a thick chunk of toughened leather. If you don’t have a strop but you want to try this and you’ve got an old leather belt, use that!"

      "content": "Drag the backside of the blade against the leather or whetstone. Hold the blade at a 15- to 25-degree angle at the base of the strop with the sharp side facing you. Push the blade into the leather and drag it away from you. Once you get to the end of the strop, lift the blade back up."

      "content": "Repeat this motion a dozen times or so to sharpen the blade. Continue to drag the blade over the leather strop or whetstone repeatedly. Use quick, firm motions to smooth out impurities in the blade and sharpen it. [6] X Expert Source Woody Lovell Professional Barber [v161245_b01] 28 January 2020. Flip the blade over and repeat this process on the opposite side of the blade if you’re sharpening a straight razor, eyebrow razor, or safety razor."

      "content": "Clean the blade after each use with soapy water. Maintaining a clean razor blade can keep the edge sharp and crisp. After each shave, swirl the razor around in some soapy water.

      "content": "Disinfect the blade with alcohol to kill bacteria periodically. If you don’t disinfect your razor every now and then, all kinds of germs and bacteria can sit on the edge of the blade and dull it over time. Once every few weeks, swirl the razor blade around in some rubbing alcohol to kill any contaminants. Then, rinse the alcohol off under water. [8] X Expert Source Woody Lovell Professional Barber [v161245_b01] 28 January 2020. If you shave with any kind of astringent, like aftershave or alcohol, you can skip this process."

      "title": "Dry the blade thoroughly every time you clean it.",
      "content": "Dry the blade thoroughly every time you clean it. Water can cause the edge of your blade to rust and dull over time, so always dry your razor blade by hand whenever it gets wet. Use a clean, dry towel to manually wipe each side of the razor down to remove the moisture. [9] X Expert Source Woody Lovell Professional Barber [v161245_b01] 28 January 2020."

      "content": "Oil the blade after fully drying it to preserve the metal. After you’ve cleaned the blade, slather the blade manually or soak it in a glass of mineral oil (or baby oil). This will leave a thin layer of oil on the metal blade which should protect it from rust and other contaminants. This will dramatically improve the overall life of the blade. [10] X Research source"

      "content": "Store your razor in a drawer or case to protect it from moisture. Once your blade is dry, keep it that way! Store your razor blade in a carrying case, or place it in a drawer. You can also wrap the blade in a thick towel to ensure that moisture doesn’t creep its way in if you want a quick fix. [11] X Expert Source Woody Lovell Professional Barber [v161245_b01] 28 January 2020. Arguably the worst place to store a razor blade is the counter of your vanity. Every time you shower, the moisture in your air will stick to the razor blade, so always store it elsewhere."
