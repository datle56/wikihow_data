      "content": "Decarb the cannabis in the oven. Set your oven to a nice, low temperature—anything between 225 and 240 °F (107 and 116 °C) is a good, safe range. Then, hand-crumble the weed into small, rice-sized chunks and pour them out onto a foil-lined baking sheet. Secure another sheet of foil over the crumbled weed, and then leave the weed in the oven for 40-45 minutes so it can successfully decarb. What you’re aiming for is golden-brown weed that looks a little bit toasted. [1] X Research source “ Decarbing ” is short for “decarboxylating,” a simple but necessary process that activates the psychoactive compounds in your weed. Raw weed contains cannabinoids known as THCA and CBDA; when decarboxylated, they’re transformed into THC and CBD, the components of marijuana that weed users know and love. [2] X Research source Although it’s an annoying step, decarbing is an important element of making good cannabutter. Once the weed is successfully decarbed, set it on the counter and give it time to thoroughly cool down."

      "content": "Infuse the decarbed weed in the butter for 3 hours. Transfer the cooled weed to the simmering water-butter mixture and secure the saucepan with the lid. Set a timer for about 3 hours to let the weed completely infuse into the butter. Leave the lid on the entire time—once the mixture has a more shiny and thick consistency, it’s ready to strain. [4] X Research source Some people prefer to infuse their weed for only 90 minutes. [5] X Research source Keep in mind, though, that the longer you infuse the butter, the more powerful the high will be."

Stack two sheets of cheesecloth on the surface of a large bowl, securing them in place with a rubber band or section of string. Then, carefully pour the infused butter into the cheesecloth, which helps filter the pieces of weed out of the butter. Once you’ve transferred all the butter, give the cheesecloth an extra squeeze for good measure. [6] X Research source Use oven mitts to protect your hands, as the infused butter will be very hot."

      "content": "Cover and refrigerate the butter for 1 hour and let it separate. Cover the bowl with the cheesecloth again and set it in the refrigerator for 1 hour—this gives the butter time to separate cleanly from the water you cooked it with. After an hour, check to see if the butter has formed a solid layer on top of the water. [7] X Research source"

Lay a clean towel on a cutting board and place the butter on top. Then, use the towel to lightly dry off the cannabutter. [8] X Research source If you don’t plan on using the butter right away, slip it into an airtight container (like a tightly sealed jar) and store it in your refrigerator or freezer for up to 6 months. [9] X Research source Feel free to dump the water at this point—you don’t need it anymore."

Using our previous calculations, we can safely assume that the entire batch will contain around 592 mg of THC (74 x 8). 592 divided by 16 is 37, which means a single brownie would have 37 mg of THC.

If you have a relatively low THC tolerance (or aren’t sure what your tolerance is), start with a small dose of 5 mg or less—using the example above, that would be about 1/7 of a brownie. It takes at least 30 minutes for most people to start feeling the effects of an edible, so don’t start consuming extra. [15] X Research source If you’re using your butter as a spread rather than as an ingredient, use a tiny amount (like 1 ⁄ 4 to 1 ⁄ 2 tsp (1.2 to 2.5 mL)) first."

According to some weed enthusiasts, cannabutter can be used in place of regular butter without the need for any additional substitutions. [16] X Research source If you aren’t sure of your weed tolerance, though, it might be best to start with just a little bit of cannabutter rather than a complete substitution. Marijuana edibles can be extremely potent, so it’s better to play it safe as you figure out your tolerance (and the potency of your butter). [17] X Research source Tip: Get a feel for the potency of your batch by spreading a tiny bit (no more than 1 ⁄ 4 to 1 ⁄ 2 tsp (1.2 to 2.5 mL)) on a bagel or piece of toast before you start baking with it."

For instance, try sliding the weed into an oven-safe bag or pouring it into a mason jar first; then, put the bag or jar into the oven. [19] X Research source Be cautious putting glass in the oven, as it may crack from the intense heat. Cracking open a window may also help you to manage the smell. Keep in mind, though, that this precaution won’t eliminate the smell. If you share a living space, let your roommates know ahead of time so they can be prepared."

Keep the butter and water ratio the same and simply adjust the amount of bud you grind in. You can also adjust the cooking times, cooking less for less potent weed, but this is just a waste of weed—fewer buds cooked for a longer time will get the same results. 1 ounce of buds will lead to some strong, strong butter, but you should probably use 1 1/2 ounces if you only have shake or leaves. [20] X Research source If you use a lot more than 1 ounce, add more butter to absorb all of the THC. However, 1 ounce of weed per 1 pound of butter is usually more than enough marijuana."

The following method is for smaller batches, and reliably turns out 1 ⁄ 2 c (120 mL) of marijuana butter quickly and easily.

Simmer for 45 minutes, stirring often. There should only be small bubbles on the butter's surface. Strain through a strainer and cheesecloth. Chill and use. [21] X Research source"

This scientific little trick helps break down the cellulose in your buds, leading to greater THC release and a less green final color. However, this only works if you do the decarboxylation step (pre-bake). Simply spray the buds after they come out of the oven and let them sit for 10-15 minutes while you start melting the butter.

This recipe uses the nifty cooking trick of blanching, rapidly heating and cooling the buds, to remove chlorophyll and other stinky chemicals. To pull it off, you need to be prepared to pre-bake as well, so get ready for a several-hour cook. That said, blanching is easy: Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Set aside another bowl and fill it with ice water. Place your ground-up weed in a tea ball, then dunk it in the boiling water for 5 minutes. Remove the weed ball and place it immediately in the ice bath for 1 minute. Repeat until all the weed is blanched Pre-bake the weed at 220 °F (104 °C) for one hour to dry out. Make your cannabutter like normal."
