While your instinct may be to confront the perpetrator, it is best to move away from the person and let the police handle the situation. Public lewdness and/or indecent exposure are crimes in most states. Depending on the state, indecent exposure is the act of knowingly exposing your genitals to someone in public. Many states require that the person intend to alarm their victims and engage in the behavior as a means of sexual arousal. [1] X Research source Public lewdness typically involves a person committing a lewd act in public, such as masturbating, and that people who witness the behavior feel alarmed or affronted. [2] X Research source Some states charge public lewdness as a Class C Misdemeanor, which may require that a person found guilty pay a fine and/or serve time in jail.

While some people may dismiss a person's penchant for flashing their genitalia or masturbating in public, it is important that you recognize that this is a criminal act and that there is a victim. If you witnessed either of these activities then you have been subjected to criminal behavior. In some circumstances exhibitionists (those engaging in indecent exposure or public lewdness) escalate their behavior to sexual assault. Some states require that the person charged with indecent exposure have the intent to arouse sexual gratification. This is to make sure that someone who is urinating in public is not automatically charged with public indecency. In other states, the mere act of exposing your genitals to another in public is enough to give rise to a misdemeanor. Some states include public masturbation within their indecent exposure laws, whereas others may refer to this activity as public lewdness. [3] X Research source The people most often targeted by indecent behavior are women but children are also targeted. Some states have enhanced criminal penalties for indecent exposure or public lewdness when a child was exposed to the behavior. [4] X Research source"

In this instance, you would not call 911 but instead you would call the local precinct where you were subject to the indecent exposure or public lewdness. As soon as possible, write down everything you remember from the incident, including what if anything the perpetrator said or did; where the harassment occurred; whether other people also witnessed the indecent conduct; and provide any other information that may be helpful in identifying the perpetrator. If you call to report a crime, the police may ask you to come to the police station or meet you at your home to take your statement. Be specific as possible when describing where you were accosted and provide the police with a physical description of the perpetrator. [6] X Research source"

If you feel unsafe, you should draw attention to the indecent behavior and move away from the person. By drawing attention to the conduct, your fellow commuters may be able to offer you some support or protection from the offending conduct. If you see someone committing acts of indecent exposure or public lewdness on public transportation, take a picture or video of the person, only if you can do so safely. The image will help police locate the offender. [7] X Research source Some public transportation companies also have a way for you to report sexual misconduct. For example, the MTA in New York City allows people to make complaints about sexual misconduct on its website. You can always report the conduct to the bus driver or conductor and they will be able to help you report the crime."

This type of conduct is considered sexual harassment and employers are legally responsible to prevent and respond to this type of conduct. If you do not feel comfortable discussing the matter with your supervisor, report the conduct to a person in charge of human resources. You should also request a copy of your employer's sexual harassment policy. If you are a member of a union you should report the conduct to your union representative and file a claim within 6 months of the incident. You can also file a claim with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) but you must do so within 180 days of the incident. You can also file a report with local law enforcement.

Individuals with developmental or intellectual disabilities may not be able to judge whether actions like this are appropriate. If you are around individuals with severe disabilities, be kind and talk to their guardians or caretakers about an appropriate response to unwanted behavior. Sometimes ignoring the behavior is the best course of action. Other types of mental health problems may call for a different type of response. If you feel that you or anyone else is in immediate physical danger, slowly move away from the person and do not make any threatening moves in their direction. Call the police and indicate that a mentally ill person is exposing himself in public. The police should be trained to respond to people with mental health issues and can direct him to the appropriate services, including a psychiatric hospital."
