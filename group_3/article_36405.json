      "content": "Wipe any excess or remaining wet paint from the affected area. If you know that you've used a latex-based paint, and the paint has already dried significantly, then you definitely want to use hairspray to remove the stain. You should still wipe off any excess paint that you can, but your stain is probably more deeply set if you're using hairspray. Use a knife or other sharp object to scrape off more deeply set paint. While latex paint comes out of fabrics much more easily than oil-based paint, it will dry more quickly. Within one or two hours, the paint will dry completely. This is when you should resort to using hairspray. If you catch a latex paint stain before it dries, scrub it with soap and water. After a few rinses and a trip through the washing machine, it will probably be removed."

      "content": "Spray hairspray on the affected area. If you don't have hairspray, then you can use a pure isopropyl alcohol, otherwise known as rubbing alcohol [1] X Expert Source Kamel Almani Laundry & Cleaning Specialist Expert Interview. 9 April 2021. . This is the active compound in the hairspray that will break down the stain, meaning that either method will work in the same fashion. You can give the hairspray a couple of minutes to set in. Make sure that you've really doused the problem area in hairspray. It should feel quite moist, as you'll need quite a bit to break down the stain if it's already set."

      "title": "Scrub gently with a brush or washcloth.",
      "content": "Scrub gently with a brush or washcloth. If you rub too harshly, you'll damage your fabric permanently. You should see the paint starting to loosen or liquify from the affected area. If the hairspray isn't changing color at all, then you may have not applied enough, or the alcohol base may not be strong enough. Continue scrubbing until you notice a reduction of the stain's size or pigmentation. If you're not seeing immediate results with the use of hairspray, then you may have to purchase some proper rubbing alcohol to fully get rid of the stain. You can repeat this process in the exact same fashion that you would with hairspray."

      "title": "Run the garment through the laundry.",
      "content": "Run the garment through the laundry. After you've successfully removed some of the paint by scrubbing, you can run a normal wash on your damaged article of clothing. Even if the stain hasn't disappeared completely, you've definitely loosened it, and more of the stain should wash out with a rinse. You also can apply a bit of detergent and water to the stain after applying the hairspray. Because latex paint does not react negatively to water, you won't run into the same \"gumming\" problems that you would with oil-based paint."

      "content": "Wipe off any remaining wet paint that may still be on the fabric. The detergent method will work best if it hasn't set in completely yet. It's also the easiest to pull off on the fly, as most people should have detergent on hand, whether you're at home or at work. If you don't have any detergent available, you can try using bar or liquid soap. It may not be as effective, but you definitely want to attempt to clean the fabric before the paint dries."

      "content": "Flush the back of the fabric with warm water. You should rinse from behind the stain, isolating the section that's been covered. If the stain has come from a watercolor or kids' tempera paint, it will probably start to rinse out fairly quickly. [2] X Research source These washable paints don't always come out immediately, but you'll definitely start to see some color bleeding out of the fabric. Check the paint bottle to see if you have a washable paint. If you do, you'll have a much easier time cleaning the stain, and you may just have to rinse with water and can skip using the detergent."

      "content": "Mix together equal parts of dish detergent and warm water. Before starting to apply to your clothing, you'll want to check the labels of your garment and your detergent to ensure that they're compatible.If you're not totally sure, apply the mixture to an inconspicuous area of your garment. This way, you can check the viability of your mixture without damaging your clothes irreparably. Soak a clean sponge in the detergent and water mixture. Be sure not to use a paper towel or cotton cloth. The fibers will get stuck and rub off in your clothing, creating a larger mess. Always put a cloth or fabric underneath your damaged clothing. You don't want it to bleed onto the surface that you're operating on. Even if the paint is washable, you'll avoid staining your countertop or table with any excess color."

      "content": "Blot the front side of the garment with the soapy sponge. Remember that blotting is different than rubbing. If you rub at the fabric with your sponge, you'll essentially push the paint deeper into the fibers of your fabric. While you can be pretty vigorous with the blotting, you want to make sure you aren't permanently damaging your garment. You can also put the shirt between your fingers, rubbing the mixture gently into the fabric."

Make sure that you aren't staining anything else with your dripping, including your sink. If there's excess paint and water in the garment, make sure to wring it into a separate bowl. You'll be able to dispose of it more easily."

This can often be successful in releasing paint from the fibers of your clothes without rubbing the color any deeper into the fabric. Be cautious with this, however, as any excessive force may get the pigment stuck in the fabric."

      "content": "Rinse your garment using your washing machine. Running your stained article of clothing through a wash cycle can often get rid of the stain completely. You've loosened the paint using the detergent, so your washing machine will work much more efficiently. Without pre-treating the garment, however, the washing machine might not be able to fully eliminate your stain. Certain washable or water-based paints may not require this step. Don't wash your paint stained garment with another article of clothing, as the paint will bleed onto your other clothes. You don't want to damage your entire wardrobe just to save a single item. If the stain is still present after a wash cycle, place a bit of acetone on the front of the garment and blot with a clean sponge. Do not put acetone on fabrics that also contain acetate or triacetate, as it will melt these fabrics on contact. [3] X Research source"

[4] X Research source When attempting to clean your stains, wear proper safety clothing, including gloves, safety goggles, and a respirator. If you're cleaning the stain while inside in your home, open a window to properly ventilate the fumes. This solvent is also very flammable, so be sure not to bring it near any sort of open flame. Even though turpentine is less toxic than most paint thinners, there's no harm in being safe and wearing the proper gear when cleaning fabric with it."

Oil-based paints are much harder to remove than water-based paints, but can still be attacked with a little bit of know-how. Keep in mind that oil-based paints take a significantly longer amount of time to dry than washable or latex paints. [5] X Research source After an oil-based paint has dried completely, it's a much larger pain to get rid of. If you notice an oil-based paint stain on your clothing, you should rub it out immediately. Your chance of saving the fabric will increase exponentially if you can treat these stains early. If the stain has set, you can even use a knife or other sharp object to scrape the dried paint from the fabric. Be careful not to stab into the garment and damage it."

If the paint bleeds through to the other side of your garment, you may end up staining the other side of your fabric. You also don't want to damage the surface that you're working on. This especially important with oil-based paints, as they won't wash out nearly as easily as a latex or water-based paint. You will have to change out this backing pad a few times throughout the cleaning process. If the paint has bled through completely and stained the pad, then you won't be able to avoid staining other parts of your clothing. Make sure to be conscious of how much paint the pad has been absorbed. If you think the pad will start leaking soon, you should swap it out."

Anything too volatile and flammable will most likely damage your fabric. You don't want to discolor your clothing in the process, then you have to be careful with the thinner that you choose.

Make sure that if your fabric can't be bleached, you don't use a detergent with bleach. You can apply the detergent liberally to the affected area, blotting it with a small sponge or cloth. Be careful not to rub too harshly, as you could push the paint deeper into the fabric. If you are still wearing your rubber gloves, you can use your fingers to apply the detergent. If not, don't let your bare skin touch the paint thinner. Many thinners can be quite toxic to your skin, and you want to avoid any potential risk."

Check the tag on your garment to check the maximum temperature that it can handle. When you wake up the next morning, you can run it through a normal laundry cycle. Be sure not to wash it with any other articles of clothing, as you run the risk of staining the rest of your load. If you see a significant change in the coloration after the first attempt, then it's worth repeating the process again.If not, however, the stain may be permanent. This means you may have to throw the garment out. The more times that you apply the thinner or turpentine to the fabric, the larger the risk of further damage to the material."
