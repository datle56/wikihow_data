      "title": "Pick an appropriate probe.",
      "content": "Pick an appropriate probe. Ball-tipped probes are generally safest so they don't hurt the snake, though ones that are dull-tipped are also appropriate. You can find kits online that come in several sizes. [1] X Research source You don't want to use one too small. The probe should just fit inside the opening when you perform the procedure. [2] X Research source However, don't ever use one over 4 millimeters on a corn snake. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Have someone hold the snake face up.",
      "content": "Have someone hold the snake face up. It is difficult to do this procedure by yourself. It's much easier if you have someone available to hold the snake face up. You should be looking at the tail end. [4] X Research source Make sure the person is supporting most of the snake's body with her hands, especially the middle part of the body. [5] X Research source You can also have her control the head by placing gentle pressure on either side of the head at the base. The reason you don't grasp the snake underneath the head is that it can cut off breathing. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Bend the tail backward.",
      "content": "Bend the tail backward. Gently tip the tail away from you. This slight bend will expose the cloacal opening, which is where you will be inserting the probe. Locate the opening. [8] X Research source"

      "title": "Insert the probe.",
      "content": "Insert the probe. Use the tip of the probe to gently find an opening, going towards the tail end. You don't want to push too hard, as you can hurt the snake. Once you find an opening, push the probe in, letting it go as far as it will without too much pressure. [9] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Examine how far the probe went in.",
      "content": "Examine how far the probe went in. Count how many scales the probe went in. If you can't tell, mark where it is at the opening with your finger and pull it out. Hold it up against the snake from the opening towards the tail. Count the number of scales. If it only went in a couple of scales, it's likely a female. If it went in 8 to 16 scales, it's likely a male. [10] X Research source The reason you probe a snake is to see how far the probe goes. If it goes a longer way in, you have a male snake. If it goes a short way in, you have a female snake. Essentially, when you are inserting it along one of his hemipenes, one of two of his inverted genitalia. A female doesn't have these parts, so you won't be able to go as far. [11] X Research source"

      "title": "Have someone hold the other end of the snake.",
      "content": "Have someone hold the other end of the snake. Some corn snakes will bite when you pop them. Therefore, try to have someone control the head so you don't get bitten. The person should hold the snake near the base of the head, placing light pressure on the sides of the head. Don't apply pressure underneath the head, as that can cut off breathing. [12] X Research source Remember to only perform this technique on hatchlings."

    {
      "title": "Use your other thumb to apply pressure.",
      "content": "Use your other thumb to apply pressure. Moving from the tip of the tail towards the cloaca, apply gentle pressure along the snake. You are gently squeezing it toward the cloaca, sort of like getting toothpaste out of a tube. [15] X Research source Applying excessive force could cause tissue damage to the snake. Make sure you don't press too hard. Before you try this procedure for yourself it is best to be shown what to do by an expert, such as a specialist reptile vet or a trained herpetologist."

      "content": "Watch for the hemipenes. In a male snake, the hemipenes will pop out. [16] X Research source You'll see two little tubes pop out of the opening if it is a male. [17] X Research source A female won't have these tubes. All you'll see is two pink dots at the opening."

      "title": "Look at the girth.",
      "content": "Look at the girth. In a female snake, the body of the snake will immediately taper after the vent, going towards the tip of the tail. In a male snake, generally the tail will stay the same girth for an inch or two before tapering. [19] X Research source Males will also be longer from the cloaca to the tip, but that is difficult to distinguish if you don't have another snake for a comparison. [20] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Count scales.",
      "content": "Count scales. Another method to visually determine the sex of the snake is to count the scales from the cloaca to the tip of the tale on the underside of the belly. It's easiest to do this process on a shed skin, as you will have a hard time keeping a snake still in the process. In an adult, males usually have more than 140 scales, while females usually have less than 130 scales. Between 130 and 140, it is difficult to tell the sex. If you can't see it very well, try taking a picture and zooming in."
