      "title": "Make sure you have nothing on the day you'll be chaining.",
      "content": "Make sure you have nothing on the day you'll be chaining. Shiny chaining can take hours, and once you start chaining, putting your 3DS into standby mode will break the chain."
    },
    {
      "title": "Equip the Shiny Charm.",
      "content": "Equip the Shiny Charm. This step is not required by any means, however it will help. You can obtain the shiny charm from Professor Birch after completing the National Pokédex (Barring event Pokémon)."
    },
    {
      "title": "Buy a lot of Repels.",
      "content": "Buy a lot of Repels. These items will keep Pokémon that are below your main Pokémon's level from attacking and breaking your chain. As you will not be relying on getting random encounters when chaining, these items will be a godsend. Be sure that you have enough Poké Balls to catch the shiny when you find it. It is recommended that you get Timer Balls, Ultra Balls, and Dusk Balls for when your planning on chaining during the night."
    },
    {
      "title": "Get False Swipe.",
      "content": "Get False Swipe. This step will save you so much trouble in the long run. False Swipe is a move that always leaves the opposing Pokémon at 1 HP. This move can be taught by TM, and 16 Pokémon can learn it naturally. You can find it in the Rustboro City Poké Mart. On that note, be sure to also bring a Pokémon that can inflict a status condition like sleep or paralysis."
    },
    {
      "title": "Capture the Pokémon you want shiny.",
      "content": "Capture the Pokémon you want shiny. In order to start chaining, you need to use the DexNav to search for the Pokémon that you want. You can't search for the Pokémon you want until you have already caught at least one of them."
    },
    {
      "title": "Move to the middle of the grass.",
      "content": "Move to the middle of the grass. If there's multiple patches nearby, then move to the middle of them. This will give you enough room to move in any direction."
    },
    {
      "title": "Use your first Repel, and then search for the Pokémon that you want.",
      "content": "Use your first Repel, and then search for the Pokémon that you want. Once you hit the search button, a patch of grass will start to shake, and part of the Pokémon you're searching for will stick out of it."
    },
    {
      "title": "Sneak, don't walk or run.",
      "content": "Sneak, don't walk or run. If you push the circle pad gently, your character will start to sneak instead of walk. Make sure you don't scare off the Pokémon, or else you'll break the chain."
    },
    {
      "title": "Defeat the Pokémon.",
      "content": "Defeat the Pokémon. Once you've done that, repeat step seven. This will be a very long and tedious process, so be prepared to spend hours fighting Pokémon. Remember to not run away from a Pokémon, as doing that breaks your chain. If a Pokémon runs away, your chain is broken, restart. If a Pokémon uses Teleport, your chain is broken, restart. If you leave the area or get into a battle with a Trainer, your chain is broken, restart. Note that getting the message \"The Pokémon couldn't be found. Try looking in a different area!\" will not break the chain, nor will encountering another Pokémon, as long as it was hidden. Said Pokémon running away will also break your chain."
    },
    {
      "title": "Keep repeating this process until you have a shiny.",
      "content": "Keep repeating this process until you have a shiny. The chance of encountering a Shiny Pokémon increases by 0.5% per encounter after 40 chained encounters, and will remain at that rate as long as the chain continues, meaning a 50% chance of encountering a Shiny Pokémon in the first 130 chained encounters. It's a tedious process, but when you finally get that shiny, it'll all have been worth it!"
