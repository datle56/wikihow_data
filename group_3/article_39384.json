      "title": "Check auction sites.",
      "content": "Check auction sites. For harder to find items, check online auction sites. These are a little more hands-on than simply purchasing from a store, but you can potentially find good deals and rare items if you take the time. See this guide for tips on auction sites. [3] X Research source Auction sites have a lot more rules and regulations than traditional stores, and require a fair amount of input from you, the buyer.

      "title": "Visit market-specific sites.",
      "content": "Visit market-specific sites. Beyond the big-name stores and auction sites, there are also a variety of marketplaces that cater to specific markets.

      "title": "Look at deal aggregation sites.",
      "content": "Look at deal aggregation sites. A lot of forums and sites exist for finding deals on specific items.

There are plenty of people who offer get-rich-quick schemes and \"life-changing\" products, but these should all be met with a hefty dose of skepticism. Always read reviews of the seller and the product before making any purchases."

    {
      "title": "Note the shipping costs.",
      "content": "Note the shipping costs. Even if you find an amazing deal on an item, it might be offset by what you have to pay to ship it. If the shipping costs are outrageous, ask yourself if it's worth paying to ship as opposed to getting it from the store downtown. Compare the costs of different shipping methods. If you don't need it immediately, you could save yourself a lot of money by picking a slower shipping method. Be especially wary of shipping costs from auction sites. These are set at the discretion of the seller, and unscrupulous senders may hike up shipping to take advantage of customers."
