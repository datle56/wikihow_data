      "content": "Switch the last 2 letters before you pronounce it. Given the way that “meme” is spelled, it’s no surprise that the pronunciation is tricky. One way to overcome this is to get in the habit of switching the last 2 letters, “m” and “e,” whenever you are reading or saying the word. When you switch the last 2 letters, the word looks like “meem,” which is easier to pronounce correctly. [6] X Research source Over time, you’ll start to automatically pronounce “meme” like “meem.”"

      "content": "Remember that the word “meme” was created to be similar to the word “gene.” The word “meme” may have a bizarre spelling, but that’s because the person who created the word, famous author and researcher Richard Dawkins, wanted it to have a similar spelling to “gene.” In the mid-1970s, Dawkins coined the term “meme” to describe ideas that spread between people, kind of like how genes replicate and get passed on to others. [7] X Research source If you’re ever struggling to remember the right pronunciation, just think about the origins of the word to help you out. The word “gene” is pronounced with a long “e” sound, and the last “e” is silent, just like how “meme” is pronounced."
