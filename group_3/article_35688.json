      "title": "Elevate your entire leg with your foot above the level of your heart.",
      "content": "Elevate your entire leg with your foot above the level of your heart. While you are lying down or sitting, always rest your affected leg on 1 to 2 pillows. Position the pillows under your calf and ankle so that your leg will be straight and not bent at the knee while you elevate it. Ensure that your foot is above the level of your heart and elevate your leg at a 45 degree or greater angle from your body.

      "content": "Place an ice pack on your affected knee while you are resting. If you are seated or lying down, icing your knee can also help to reduce swelling. Wrap an ice pack in a thin cloth and place it onto your affected knee. Keep the ice pack on your knee for 10 to 20 minutes, then remove it for 1 to 2 hours so your skin can return to its normal temperature. Repeat this as needed throughout the day. [2] X Research source Avoid putting an ice pack directly on your skin as it may cause frostbite and skin damage. Make sure to refreeze the ice pack when you are done with it so it will be cold the next time you need it. Never use a heating pad on your knee when it is swollen as this can make the swelling worse. Only use ice packs on your knee when it is swollen. [3] X Research source Try a continuous cooling system to provide consistent icing to your knee if you’re able. You can buy systems online for around $150 USD."

      "content": "Ask your doctor about wearing compression stockings . Compression stockings can help to promote better circulation and reduce swelling in your legs. [4] X Research source If your doctor has prescribed compression stockings, ask your doctor how long you will need to wear them after your surgery. Put on and take off the stockings daily as instructed. Pull them onto your foot first and then roll them up to just below your knee. Smooth out any wrinkles in the stocking by pulling it up more. [5] X Trustworthy Source MedlinePlus Collection of medical information sourced from the US National Library of Medicine Go to source Compression stockings can be difficult to put on. If you apply lotion to your legs first, wait until it has fully absorbed into your skin before putting on the stockings. You can also apply cornstarch or baby powder to your legs to make it easier to get the stockings on. Wash your stockings daily in a bowl or sink full of soapy water and then rinse them thoroughly. Hang them up to dry and wait until they are completely dry to wear them again. You can get compression stockings from a medical supply store and your insurance may even cover the cost of them. Compression stockings can give you an infection if you wear them over recent wounds or incisions. Talk to your primary care provider to determine if compression stockings are safe to use."

      "content": "Take your medications exactly as instructed following surgery. If you have been prescribed any medications, such as a blood thinner or pain medication, take them exactly as your doctor has instructed you to. Not taking a prescribed blood thinner may increase the chances of a blood clot, which may cause a rapid onset of swelling. If this happens, contact your doctor or go to an emergency room immediately. Knee surgeries increase the risk of venous thrombosis (blood clots in the veins) during the first 3 months of recovery. Follow your care provider’s instructions completely for any blood thinners they prescribe."
