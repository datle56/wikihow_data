Additionally, each piece of wood should be 7 cm (0.23 ft) wide and 2 cm (0.79 in) thick. The best wood for this is pine, but you can use any wood you have at your disposal."

Place the timber on a solid, steady work surface and cut it with either a hand saw or a power saw. Cut the wood down to the following lengths: 2 pieces that are 1.8 m (5.9 ft) long (main legs) 1 piece that is 1.5 m (4.9 ft) long (back leg) 1 piece that is 68 cm (27 in) long (cross piece) 1 piece that is 23 cm (9.1 in) long (cross piece) Be sure to take the proper safety precautions when using a saw."

You can use a hammer and nails if you don't have a drill and screws. You can lean the \"A\" shaped frame against a wall and use it if you don't want to finish building your easel.

The rope will provide extra support for the back leg of the easel. To make the drilling easier, hold the back leg up against the horizontal piece when you're drilling.
