      "content": "Use code for email readers. Not all email readers have the same capabilities as web browsers. Design your email so more people will be able to view the HTML version instead of having to revert to the plain-text version. Structure content by using tables. Store images on a live web server or use stock images. Use \"https://\" (or \"http://\") in your links."

      "content": "Rely on the text to communicate your message. Though it is more appealing to use colors and graphics, there is a good chance that someone on your email list will not be able to view your HTML email, no matter how well it is designed. Unless you absolutely have to use an image, stick to text where possible. Spam filters can block images and attachments. They also tend to filter emails of substantial size, which can include you if you have large image files or numerous images. Many mobile users won't see your images anyway."

You can also identify an email address for them to contact and ask to be removed if they no longer wish to receive your emails at any point in the future. Include your business's name and physical mailing address. Readers need to know that you are a valid businesses and not a scheme or spammer. Ensure that the \"from\" and \"reply-to\" addresses are valid and active. Provide a way for readers to contact you if they have questions or are interested in supporting your business. Choose an appropriate subject line. Your subject should be a concise description of what the email contains, not invalid sales offers or false promotions."
