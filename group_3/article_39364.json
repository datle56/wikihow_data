      "content": "Picking the right place and time is crucial when shooting your shot. If you’re approaching her in person, do so at a time when she’s not busy or surrounded by distractions. If you’re sending a message, hit send at a time when she’s not sleeping, working, or in school. This will increase your chances of getting a positive response and let her know you respect her. Go up to her when she’s alone and not surrounded by friends. Try to avoid shooting your shot in the middle of class if you go to school together. Ask her if she wants to meet you later to chat."

      "content": "Start by indirectly saying, “I like you.” Craft that first DM, text, or pick-up line around something you truly like about her. Complimenting appearances is a great start, but try aiming for something other than looks. Tell her why you like her on a deeper level. Here’s a mix of some of our favorite compliments: [1] X Research source “Could you be any cuter?” “You have the prettiest eyes.” “Your smile can light up any room.” “You know what’s awesome? You.” “I wish I could hear you laugh all day.” “You’re absolutely incredible. You know that?” “I’ve never met someone with a heart as big as yours.”"

      "content": "Messaging her on social media is a great way to grab her attention. Start a conversation by sliding into her DMs with an open-ended question. Shooting your shot is all about breaking the ice, so why not ask her a question she’s bound to answer? Comment on something she’s posted to her Instagram story or message her about a fact in her bio. [2] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Business Review Online and print journal covering topics related to business management practices Go to source Try shooting your shot with one of these DM messages: “Your puppy is adorable. How old is he?” “I’m curious…What’s your favorite pizza topping?” “I loved that book! Got any other recommendations?” “Your food always looks so good! Who taught you to cook?” “I can’t stop thinking about tomorrow’s test. What do you think will be the hardest part?”"

      "content": "Capture her attention on social media to shoot your shot. Whether you know her IRL or not, liking and commenting on her posts is a great way to say, “Hey, I see you.” The more you interact with her profile, the more often she’ll see yours, so type whatever pops into your mind. Aim for flirty, friendly, and funny comments like: “Stop being so perfect.” “Looking super cute, as always.” “This is the best thing I’ve ever seen.” “Is something on fire, or is it just you?” “That pizza looks good! Can I have some?”"

Send her funny memes, tell her a joke , or say a cheesy pick-up line to erase any awkwardness that may come with approaching her. You can base your hilarious remarks and texts around her interests, or opt for one of these smile-inducing pick-up lines: “You’re so stunning I forgot my pick-up line.” “Is your name WiFi? Because I feel a connection.” “Are you a thief? Because you’ve stolen my heart.” “I’ve got to call the cops. It’s got to be illegal to be so pretty.” “Do you have a bandage? I scraped my knee falling for you.”"

      "content": "Playing games to try and win her heart will only push her away. Rather than beating around the bush, tell her how you truly feel. Vulnerability and honesty go a long way when talking to a girl, especially when you’re hoping for a future relationship. Try saying something like: “You’re a really amazing person.” “I’m not going to lie. I really like you.” “I feel safe when I’m with you, you know?” This can go farther than just expressing your feelings for her, so try telling her about yourself and your hardships. Opening up to her emotionally can pave the path for a successful and long-lasting relationship."

You’ve shown your ambitions and gotten her attention, so now it’s time to ask, “Will you go out with me?” Ask her out naturally by stating your feelings and pausing to let her reply, or simply asking the question word-for-word. [4] X Research source Make it about her by asking, “How would you feel if I asked you out?” instead of, “I want to ask you out.” [5] X Research source Ask her to do something with a date in mind. Rather than saying, “You wanna go out sometime?” be specific with a time, place, and location. Pay attention to her body language if you’re together in person. Leaning close or touching your arm could be a sign she likes you. [6] X Research source"
