To find your set on BrickEconomy quickly and easily, enter the 5-7-digit model number listed on the front of the box the set came in and its instructions in the search bar. [32] X Research source If you can't find the model number (maybe you don't have the box or the instructions anymore), try doing a more generalized search for the set type. For example, if you have a pirate ship but you're not sure which one it is, type \"pirate ship\" in the search bar on BrickEconomy and look through the results until you find one you recognize.
