      "title": "Decide whether to peel the shrimp before or after cooking.",
      "content": "Decide whether to peel the shrimp before or after cooking. Many cooks maintain that keeping the shell on the shrimp during cooking enhances the flavor since the shell keeps juices in and is itself packed with flavor. However, some people like to peel the shrimp before cooking, so it's easier to eat the finished dish. If you want to keep the shell on the body while you're cooking it, but you'd rather not cook it with the legs and vein, use a pair of kitchen scissors to snip the shell along its back. This way you can still devein the shrimp, and peel off the shell when it's done cooking."

      "content": "Use a paring knife to make a slit along the shrimp's back. Cut in about 1 ⁄ 4 inch (0.6 cm). The flesh will peel open and reveal a black or white \"vein\" just beneath the surface — you don't need to cut too deep for this. This is the digestive tract of the shrimp - stomach and colon in all.

      "title": "Firmly hold the shrimp and start pushing the tine into the vein cavity.",
      "content": "Firmly hold the shrimp and start pushing the tine into the vein cavity. The shrimp will start straightening out as the tine goes down its spine. The pressure will split the spine and roll the shell back at the same time, peeling the shrimp and deveining it all at once. This method can be done with a shrimp deveining tool you can buy at seafood markets, but a two tined cooking fork will do the same job. Running cold water over the shrimp as you're forking it helps the vein come out and moves the process along more quickly."
