      "content": "Cut the cork so that it is flat on the bottom. Cut your cork horizontally using a craft knife. If you are using a flat, squat cork, you don't need to cut it. The cork will help keep your wick afloat. If you are using a sheet of cork, cut it into a small circle or square. It needs to be small enough to fit inside your jar, but large enough so that it won't sink under the weight of the wick."

      "title": "Use a needle or a nail to poke a hole through center of cork.",
      "content": "Use a needle or a nail to poke a hole through center of cork. The hole needs to be wide enough for the wick to be able to slip through, but not so wide that the cork slides off when you hold the wick upside down."

      "content": "Fill the jar two-thirds to three-fourths of the way with olive oil. Olive oil is great to use, because it burns clean. It does not contain harmful chemicals, and it does not leave behind bad smells. If you want to save on oil, use one part water and one part oil."

The tip of the wick should be sticking no more than 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) above the top of the nut. Make sure that the inside diameter of the nut is the same as your wick.

Here are a few ideas to get you started: For a nautical or beach-themed lamp, you can fill your jar with seashells and sea glass. For a festive lamp, try adding some cedar cuttings, holly berries, and small pine cones. For a more fragrant festive lamp, add in some pine sprigs and cinnamon sticks."
