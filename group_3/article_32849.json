      "content": "Pick at least 2 movies to get the marathon going. At least 2 movies are needed, or else it won't really be a marathon. A good amount is about 4 or 5 movies, but you can watch more for an extended marathon. A true movie marathon means watching 26.2 hours of movies, just as a marathon race is 26.2 miles (42.2 km)."

      "content": "Pick a time to start your movie marathon. It depends on how long you want to stay up and how many movies you have to watch. Most movies won't be much longer than 2 hours, but make sure you know how long each movie will take. So if you are watching 5 movies starting at 9 p.m., it would be too late, unless you want to pull an all-nighter. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "No movie marathon is complete without snacks and drinks! Popcorn cannot be ignored. Be sure to buy 1 or 2 boxes before the marathon begins. If any of your friends have a sweet tooth, get some candy like M&Ms. Common drinks to have at a marathon are of course soda and juice. Try to stock up on them before the marathon. Alcohol may add an element of fun to the marathon if you are all over the legal drinking age, and the movies are on the light-hearted side. [3] X Research source"
