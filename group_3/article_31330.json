      "content": "“New digs” usually means a new place to live. Most of the time, when someone starts talking about their “new digs,” they’re referring to a new place to live, whether it’s an apartment, house, or other type of residence. [1] X Research source Some people may also use it to describe a new office or desk at a job or a new location for a store. Sometimes, people use “new digs” when they talk about checking into temporary living arrangements like a hotel or vacation rental. In the UK, “student digs” refers to housing near a university or other type of school where students live. “I just got the keys to my new digs. Want to come over and check it out?” “How do you like your new digs at the office? I’d love to be that close to the snack bar.” “Cheri’s flight just landed, so we should give her a chance to settle into her new digs before heading to her room.” “I lived in the student digs the entire time I was at Oxford.”"

      "content": "Less commonly, “new digs” can refer to new clothes or shoes. This meaning may have started as confusion over similar-sounding slang terms “new duds” or “new togs,” which both mean “new clothing.” However, there’s no evidence of any strong links between the terms. Examples of how people use “new digs” to mean clothing are: “Wow! You look great in your new digs!” “I’m going on vacation in Hawaii, so I got a whole wardrobe of new digs.” “Check out my new digs!”"

      "content": "The term “digs” probably comes from the old term “diggings.” The word “diggings” also means “living quarters.” The first appearance of “diggings” with this meaning was in 1838. It then appeared in the Charles Dickens novel Martin Chuzzlewit in 1844. The word “digs,” meaning lodgings, first appeared in print in 1893. [2] X Research source Some have theorized “diggings” became a word for a place to live after the California or Australia gold rush when miners used the term to refer to their claims. However, gold wasn’t discovered in California until the beginning of 1848, 10 years after the first appearance of the term in the UK. [3] X Research source The Australian gold rush didn’t begin until 1851. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Try a different slang term for your lodgings to change things up. Having several different ways to refer to the place you live helps you sound more natural when using slang, whether you’re a native English speaker or are learning it as a second language. Use these terms to help you build up your slang vocabulary. Pad: “Pad” has been used to refer to a bed since the 18th century. Then, in the mid-1900s, people started using it to describe a room with a bed and then a residence. For example, “He moved out of his parents’s house and into a bachelor’s pad.” Crib: “Crib” is an Old English word for a trough that holds food for livestock. By the 17th century, people began using “crib” to refer to a baby’s bed. In the 19th century, people started using the word to refer to dwellings. [5] X Research source For example, “Let’s head back to my crib to play video games.” Shanty: It’s believed that using the word “shanty” to mean a residence comes from the Canadian French word chantier , which meant “lumber camp” or “hut.” [6] X Research source In the past, this term meant the structure was small or shabby, but later, some used it to refer to their own home ironically. For example, “Welcome to my little 5-bedroom shanty.”"
