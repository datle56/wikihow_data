      "content": "Understand how HPV is transmitted. HPV can spread through any skin-to-skin contact involving the genitals. This can happen during vaginal sex, anal sex, hand-to-genital contact, HPV can remain in your system for years without causing symptoms. This means you could still have HPV even if you have not recently had sex, or if you have only been having sex with one partner. [1] X Trustworthy Source Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Main public health institute for the US, run by the Dept. of Health and Human Services Go to source You cannot get HPV from shaking hands or from inanimate objects such as toilet seats (except possibly shared sex toys). The virus does not spread through the air. Condoms do not protect you completely from HPV, but they may reduce the chance of transmission.

      "content": "Identify genital warts. Some strains of HPV can cause genital warts: lumps or growths in the genital or anal region. These are considered low risk strains, since they rarely lead to cancer. [3] X Trustworthy Source American Cancer Society Nonprofit devoted to promoting cancer research, education, and support Go to source If you're not sure whether you have genital warts, compare your symptoms to the following: The most common location for genital warts in men is under the foreskin of an uncircumcised penis, or on the shaft of a circumcised penis. Warts can also appear on the testicles, groin, thighs, or around the anus. Less commonly, warts can appear inside the anus or urethra, causing bleeding or discomfort at the toilet. You do not need to have anal sex to get anal warts. [4] X Research source The warts can vary in number, shape (flat, raised, or cauliflower-like), color (skin-colored, red, pink, grey, or white), firmness; and symptoms (none, itchiness, or pain)."

      "title": "Treat genital warts",
      "content": "Treat genital warts . Genital warts may go away on their own after a few months, and will never lead to cancer. The main reason to treat them is your own comfort. Treatments include creams or ointments (such as Podofilox, Imiquimod, or Sinecatechins) which you can apply at home, or removal at the doctor's office by freezing (cryotherapy), acid, or surgery. [13] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source A doctor can also apply vinegar to illuminate warts that aren't yet raised or visible. You can transmit HPV even if you don't have symptoms, but the chances are higher while you have genital warts. Talk to your sexual partners about this risk, and cover the warts with condoms or other barriers if possible. Although the strains of HPV that cause genital warts do not cause cancer, you may have been exposed to more than one strain. You should still talk to your doctor if you have noticed any possible cancer signs or unexplained symptoms."

      "content": "Ask about anal cancer screening if you have sex with men. HPV-related anal cancer rates are much higher among men who have sex with men. If you fall into this category, tell your doctor about your sexual orientation, and ask about the anal pap smear test. Your doctor may recommend a test every three years (one year if you are HIV positive) to screen for anal cancer. Not all doctors agree that a regular screening is necessary or helpful, but they should still educate you about the test and allow you to make your own decision. If your doctor does not offer this service or cannot tell you about it, seek a second opinion. If homosexuality is illegal in your country, you may be able to get treatment and health education resources from an international LGBT or HIV prevention organization."

If it turns out to be cancer, it will be much easier to remove if you catch it early. When in doubt, visit the doctor promptly when you see any unexplained symptom.
