      "content": "Help your rabbit get comfortable with handling by petting the rabbit gently. Start with short intervals and increase the time with the bunny. Consider placing a nice plate of greens out for the rabbit to eat while you stroke the rabbit to decrease any potential anxiety. Don't make sudden moves or sounds that might alarm your rabbit. Be gentle and soothing when you pet the rabbit. Rabbits are prey animals, so when they feel threatened, they run and hide if they can. Sit on the floor to minimize your size and avoid towering over the bunny."

      "content": "Know how not to pick up a rabbit. Never pick up a rabbit by his ears, legs, scruff, or tail. [2] X Research source Rabbits are very delicate and you could severely injure them if you pick them up incorrectly. Grabbing on to limbs, tails, or ears will cause the rabbit to react by pulling away. Doing so may cause a fracture or a dislocation or tearing of underlying muscle and soft tissue. [3] X Research source A bunny new to the household should be picked up and restrained by adults at first. Children can pet the bunny while it is on the floor or while sitting in the child’s (or adult’s) lap sitting on the floor. Staying close to the ground for a while is a good preventative measure. Should the rabbit try to escape, they will not fall a long distance and potentially injure themselves."

      "content": "Gently use the loose skin behind the rabbit’s neck to hold onto its scruff. Do not pick the rabbit up by the scruff alone, but use this as a handle to prevent forward motion while you use your other hand arm to tuck the hind legs under the bunny and scrunch the bunny in a gentle “bunny ball.” Your free hand that is not holding the scruff should be placed on the bunny’s rump. You should roll the back legs underneath, toward the front of the bunny, holding the feet up with your hand. This will prevent the rabbit from kicking out and potentially injuring itself. There are differing opinions on whether or not to scruff a rabbit. Scruffing, done gently, does not injure the rabbit. [5] X Research source Susan A. Brown, “Clinical techniques in rabbits,” Seminars in Avian and Exotic Pet Medicine, Volume 6, Issue 2, April 1997, Pages 86-95."

      "title": "Use two hands to lift the rabbit up.",
      "content": "Use two hands to lift the rabbit up. Place one under his chest and one under its behind. The positioning should be comfortable for both you and the rabbit. Make sure you have a firm (but not tight) grip on the rabbit's body so that it doesn't leap from your hands when you lift. Make sure to contain the hind legs securely, by keeping your hand on the rump and scrunching the hind legs up toward the bunny’s head. Remember, you are holding the hind legs so that they point forward, toward the head, the opposite direction of where the hind legs would be should the bunny kick out. It may help to kneel to get closer to the rabbit, so you don't have to bend and lift. Get down on the ground with the rabbit."

      "title": "Use the right approach.",
      "content": "Use the right approach. It's best to lift a rabbit either from a top-opening cage or a confined area in your house. It can be much more difficult to lift a rabbit from a side opening cage. Rabbits will often run and hide when approached, so trying to pick up a rabbit in a room with lots of furniture will also be difficult. When removing a rabbit from a side or front opening carrier, do so with the hind legs first out of the opening. That way, if they get out of your grip, they will jump back into the carrier and not down to the ground. Use one hand to hold the bunny’s head away from you, toward the back of the cage, while gently holding on to the scruff. The other hand is used over the bunny’s rump to scrunch the hind legs up into the “bunny ball” hold. Then lift the bunny out, hind legs toward you, and place under your arm so the bunny’s head is given a place to hide. If you are getting the bunny out of a top-opening carrier, you can use the same technique, just remember not to dangle the bunny by the scruff. If this is a well handled and calm bunny, you are likely to be able to safely pick up the bunny with one hand under its chest and one hand scrunching the rump, without holding on to the scruff. Be aware, that if the bunny feels like it might fall, it will struggle and kick and try to get down. If this happens, place the bunny back in the carrier and re-grip or go back to using the scruff to help with restraint."

      "title": "Coax the rabbit out of a hiding place, don't drag it out.",
      "content": "Coax the rabbit out of a hiding place, don't drag it out. If your rabbit tends to run under furniture, coax it out with a treat before trying to pick it up. Better yet, manage the area to prevent the rabbit from being able to get away and hide so that it doesn't have access to hiding places that are difficult for you to access. Try using an exercise pen to confine the bunny, but still allowing them an area large enough to hop around. Never pull on a rabbit's legs or tail to get it to move closer to you. It is better to gently get a hold of the scruff to prevent the rabbit from getting away, then you can get an arm around the rabbit’s body and contain the hind legs. Never forcefully scruff a rabbit or dangle it by the scruff. This will cause the rabbit injury."

      "title": "Look for warning signs that the rabbit will not allow you to pick it up.",
      "content": "Look for warning signs that the rabbit will not allow you to pick it up. If a rabbit thumps a hind leg when you approach, be aware that this is a warning to you that you are in their territory and they are not thrilled with your presence. The rabbit may be more difficult to handle, so be prepared. Again, remember to use confinement within an exercise pen or other area to help you manage the rabbit’s access to hiding places and allow you find and restrain the rabbit more easily."

      "content": "Lift the rabbit carefully to your side (or in front of your mid abdomen), under your arm. The rabbit will feel more secure being able to hide a bit. Your rabbit should be held and carried securely under your arm, nestled comfortably under your “wing.” [6] X Research source Susan A. Brown, “Clinical techniques in rabbits,” Seminars in Avian and Exotic Pet Medicine, Volume 6, Issue 2, April 1997, Pages 86-95. Some people call this the “football hold.” If you are right handed, place the bunny’s head under your left arm. Wrap your left arm around the outside of the rabbit while using your left hand to continue to securely hold the rabbit’s hind legs under it. Place your right hand gently over the bunny’s neck, ready to get a hold of the scruff should the bunny move suddenly. Do not hold your rabbit extended outward or swing it through the air."

For these types, it's best to use a carrying case to move them from one place to the next, rather than attempting to pick them up. Use one hand to hold the scruff to restrain the rabbit and get your other hand on the rump and “scrunch” the bunny in a “bunny ball” to transfer to the carrier."
