If your order doesn’t qualify for free shipping and there are no coupons available, try combining your order with a friend’s so you reach the free shipping minimum.

For example, if you and your friend each wanted an item that was $15, purchase both items in a single order so you spend $30 and reach the minimum for free standard shipping. Then, just have your friend pay you their portion of the total cost."
