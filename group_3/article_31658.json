      "content": "Activate your third eye by meditating and aligning your energy . Chakras are the body's energy centers, and focusing on your third eye chakra can help you see things more clearly. Sit down in a quiet, comfortable location, free of any distractions. Close your eyes and start meditating , focusing on the point right between your brows (this is where your third eye chakra sits). It’s okay if thoughts come up while you meditate. Simply let them come and go rather than focus on them. Whisper a phrase or word to yourself as you meditate to help you open your third eye. This should be something you resonate with, like “I choose happiness” or “peace.” Chant the sound om or aum while meditating to open the third eye even more. [1] X Research source Use hand mudras to channel your energy. Make a heart with your hands, then lift your middle fingers up into a triangle to activate the third eye chakra. Make meditation a part of your daily routine to keep your third eye open and active every day."
