Try flipping a coin or playing rock, paper, scissors to figure out who gets to choose the order. [1] X Research source If you can't decide, take turns shooting from the same spot. The first person to make a basket can choose their position. Continue this process until the order has been sorted. [2] X Research source"

They can add \"extra rules\" to this shot too, but they have to announce them before shooting. For example, the player can say \"I'm shooting with my eyes closed\" or \"I'm shooting behind my back.\" They get one attempt to make the basket. If a rule is called and the player succeeds in shooting the ball in but they don’t satisfy all the rules of the shot they stated, the shot doesn’t count. [3] X Research source"

They either have to create a new shot or attempt to copy the shot that was just made by the player in front of them. If the first player made a basket then the second player has to copy whatever the first player did, including where they were standing. If the first player missed the basket then the second player can shoot from anywhere, using any rules they want to invent. [4] X Research source"

Each time someone makes this mistake, they get a new letter, eventually spelling out H—O—R—S—E. When you spell out the full \"HORSE,\" you lose the game. When attempting a shot after a letter has been given, you do not receive a letter for missing. If you miss the basket, play just passes to the next player with no penalty. You can also play so that a player gains a letter each time everyone else fails a challenge. In this version, the first to get the word 'HORSE' wins."

One of the best ways to start this off is with a no-look shot. To get this shot in, take a good look at the hoop and visualize where you plan on shooting the ball before you close your eyes. If you manage to get it in, you’ll have a very high chance of putting a letter on your opponents."

There isn’t a whole lot you can do to give yourself a better chance of shooting it in here, simply aim for a nice regular arc, and use the backboard."

Try and use your legs to assist you in getting some power for this shot as otherwise you are only using your hands/arms and it becomes even more difficult."
