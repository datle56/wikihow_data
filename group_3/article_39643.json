      "content": "Your clothes fit differently. Losing weight can be a slow process, and you may not notice your stomach slimming down right away. But as you slim down—even slowly—your clothes will start to fit different: they may look looser, or clothes you thought you’d outgrown may suddenly fit like a glove. [1] X Research source Keep in mind you can’t target weight loss to a specific area, so if you’re losing fat in your belly, congrats! That means you’re losing it everywhere."

      "content": "Your waist may be smaller. While the scale won’t always give you an accurate idea of how much weight you’re losing or how fit you are, if your waist is smaller, it’s a sign you’ve lost some belly fat. Not only that, but a smaller waistline is an indicator of improved cardiovascular health: a shrinking waistline has been linked to a lower risk of cardiovascular issues. [2] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Measuring your waist regularly can help you track your weight loss progress. Just be sure to measure your waist at the same time of day to minimize fluctuations, and use a soft measuring tape to get an accurate measurement. You can still measure your waist without soft tape : just wrap a piece of string around your waist, mark how long around your waist is on the string, and then measure it against a yard stick or ruler. Try to measure your waist in the morning before breakfast: your waist size changes throughout the day depending on what you eat and drink, and measuring your waist when it's empty will give you the most accurate measurement. Remember that as your belly becomes more muscular and toned, it may actually get a bit bigger, so remember that “smaller” doesn’t always equate to “healthier.”"

      "content": "Your belly might be more defined. If you’re shedding pounds and working out, your body composition is likely to change. You may appear more muscular and defined all over—and that includes your stomach. You may notice your abs are slightly more chiseled than they were a few weeks ago. Consider taking regular photos of your body to track your weight loss journey. You may not notice small changes as they happen, but weekly photos can help you visualize your progress and motivate you to keep going. While you can’t target weight loss to a specific area, you can build up your stomach muscles with targeted strength building exercises: to really define your abs, try doing planks , sit-ups , or crunches ."

If it’s only a difference of a few pounds at first, don’t worry too much: most people aim to lose 1 or 2 pounds a week, an achievable goal that’s easier (and healthier) to maintain for the long term.

The amino acids in protein will keep you fuller for longer, meaning you're less likely to overeat. So if you're not sure your new fitness regimen is working, if you're feeling less hungry, there's a good chance it is. Data suggests plant-based protein may keep you feeling full longer than animal-based proteins, so stock up on plenty of tofu, chickpeas , lentils, and other plant-derived protein-rich goodies!

While weighing yourself regularly can help you keep quantifiable track of your fitness journey, it only accounts for how heavy your body is—not how much fat you have. Because muscle weighs more than fat, you may see the number on the scale go up as you become more fit. Other factors that may contribute to a fluctuation in your weight include the time of day that you weigh yourself. Weighing yourself right after a meal, for instance, can cause you to weigh more than you’re expecting. Experts recommend weighing yourself at the same time every day or once or twice a week.
