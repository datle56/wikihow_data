      "content": "Understand how people get syphilis. Once you understand how people pass syphilis to one another, you can figure out whether you're at risk. The disease is transferred from one person to another through contact with a syphilis sore. These sores may appear externally on the penis and outer vaginal area, or internally in the vaginal canal, anus, and rectum. They may also be present on the lips and inside the mouth. If you've had vaginal, anal, or oral sex with someone infected with the disease, you are at risk of contracting syphilis. However, you need to come into direct contact with an infected lesion. [2] X Research source [3] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source Syphilis cannot be spread by shared eating utensils, toilet seats, doorknobs, hot tubs or swimming pools. Males who have sex with males (MSM) are significantly more likely to contract syphilis, with 75% of reported new syphilis cases in 2013. It's especially important to use safer sex practices if you are a male who has sex with males.

[5] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source Even if carriers do notice sores and symptoms, they may not recognize them as an STD, and may leave them untreated for long periods of time. Because the minor sores can progress gradually from 1-20 years after the initial infection, carriers may unknowingly pass the disease on to others.

      "content": "Recognize the symptoms of primary stage syphilis. Syphilis has 3 stages: primary, secondary, and tertiary/late stage. The primary stage usually begins about 3 weeks after the first exposure to a syphilis sore. However, symptoms might begin to appear anywhere between 10 and 90 days after exposure. [7] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source The primary stage of syphilis most often begins with the appearance of a painless sore called a “chancre,” which is small, hard, circular, and painless. Although there is usually just one sore, there may be more. The sore appears where the disease entered the body. Common infection sites include the mouth, genitals, and anus.< [8] X Research source The sore will heal on its own in 4 to 8 weeks, and won't leave a scar. However, this does not mean that the syphilis is gone. Without proper treatment, the infection simply moves on to the second stage."

The secondary stage of syphilis usually begins 4 to 8 weeks after the initial infection, and lasts between 1 and 3 months. [9] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Family Physicians Organization devoted to improving the health of patients, families, and communities Go to source This stage begins with a \"maculopapular rash\" on the palms of the hands and the soles of the feet. This type of rash doesn't usually itch, but causes rough, reddish brown spots on the skin. [10] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Other rashes with a slightly different appearance may show up on other parts of the body at this time. People usually either don't notice these rashes or assume they have other causes. This usually results in delayed treatment of their actual cause. Other symptoms eventually appear in this stage as well. They too are sometimes mistaken for other problems, such as the flu or stress. These symptoms include: fatigue, muscle aches, fever, sore throat, headaches, swollen lymph glands, patchy hair loss, and weight loss. [11] X Research source About a third of those who don't get treatment during the secondary syphilis stage will develop latent or tertiary syphilis.

The syphilis bacteria is still in the body, but there are no longer any signs or symptoms of the disease. This stage can last for years. However, about a third of those who go untreated during the latent stage will develop the tertiary stage of syphilis, which has severe symptoms. Tertiary stage syphilis may not show itself until 10 to 40 years after the initial infection. [13] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Tertiary stage syphilis can see damage to the brain, heart, eyes, liver, bones, and joints. This damage may be serious enough to cause death. Other symptoms of the tertiary stage include difficulty with muscle movement, numbness, paralysis, progressive blindness, and dementia.

The syphilis test is inexpensive and easy to perform; you can have it done at a doctor's office or public health clinic. The clinicians will use one of the following methods to look for syphilis antibodies in your blood: Nontreponemal tests: These tests are ideal for screening purposes, and are about 70% accurate. If the test has a positive result, the doctor will confirm the diagnosis with a treponemal test. [17] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Treponemal tests: These tests for antibodies are more specific, and are used for confirmation rather than screening. Some clinicians test for syphilis by taking a sample from a suspected syphilis sore. They inspect the sample under a specialized microscope to look for treponema pallidum, the bacteria that causes syphilis.

The earlier the syphilis is diagnosed, the easier it is to treat; if treated within a year, a single dose of penicillin can completely cure the disease. Antibiotics can be very effective in early syphilis infection, but may have less of an effect in late syphilis. [20] X Trustworthy Source MedlinePlus Collection of medical information sourced from the US National Library of Medicine Go to source People who've had the disease longer than a year may need multiple doses of antibiotics. Patients with latent or tertiary phase syphilis will likely need 3 doses per week.

      "content": "Use latex or polyurethane condoms or dental dams. Wearing condoms during vaginal, anal, or oral sex can reduce the risk of contracting syphilis. However, the sore or site of infection must be completely covered by the condom. Always use a condom with new sexual partners, as they may not even know whether they have syphilis — especially if there are no visible sores. Be aware that you may still contract syphilis if the sore is not completely covered by the condom. It's preferable to use dental dams for oral sex with vaginas, as they usually cover a larger area than condoms that have been cut open. However, if you don't have a dental dam, you can cut open a male condom and use it instead. Latex and polyurethane condoms offer equal protection against STDs and HIV. \"Natural\" or \"lambskin\" condoms do not adequately protect against STDs. [24] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source Use a new condom for each sex act. Don't reuse condoms, even for different types of penetration (vaginal, anal, oral) in the same sexual interaction. [25] X Research source Use water-based lubricants with latex condoms. Oil-based lubes such as petroleum jelly, mineral oil, or body lotion can weaken the latex and make you more likely to contract an STD."

[27] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Babies who contract syphilis from their mothers are much more likely to be underweight, premature, or even stillborn. Even if the child is born without symptoms, untreated babies can develop serious health issues within a matter of weeks. These issues include deafness, cataracts, seizures, and potentially death. This can be avoided if the mother is tested for syphilis throughout the pregnancy and at the time of delivery. If the test comes back positive, both mother and baby can be treated.
