      "content": "Drive your car to the technician if your tire isn't losing air. Take a look at your tire. If it looks flat, don't drive on it. If it doesn't, hold your hand above the nail to see if you can feel any air coming out. You can also spray the nail with soapy water and check to see if air bubbles form. If they do form, your tire is losing air. If your tire doesn't appear to be losing air, you should be able to drive it to a nearby technician to get the hole fixed. If your tire is losing air but it hasn't lost a lot yet, you can temporarily plug it with a tire repair kit so you're able to drive to a nearby technician."

If it did, and the hole is smaller than 1 ⁄ 4 inch (0.64 cm) across, a tire service technician should be able to repair your tire. If the nail is outside of the tread or on the side of your tires, it's not fixable. If you're not sure, visit a tire service technician and get their opinion. Having your tire repaired will be cheaper than replacing it, so it's a good idea to find out if there's any way your tire can be fixed before moving forward."

A tire plug kit will come with all the tools you’ll need to plug your tire, including tire plugs, an insertion needle, and a rasp tool. Keep in mind that plugging your tire is only a temporary solution and does carry some risk. Using a plug from the outside of the tire can even damage the tire to the point that it's not usable.

[4] X Expert Source Howard Fleischmann Automotive Tire & Repair Specialist Expert Interview. 4 June 2021. If the hole the nail made is more than 1 ⁄ 4 inch (0.64 cm) across, it's too big to safely plug. You'll need to put on a spare tire or have your car towed to a repair shop. Never use a tire plug in a hole that's too big or a hole that's located on the side or shoulders of the tire. The plug could come out while you're driving and cause an accident. If the nail is small and located in the tread of your tire, you should be able to use a tire plug kit to temporarily plug the hole in your tire."
