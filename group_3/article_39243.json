Listing between 5 and 10 key responsibilities is a good start. Add any roles and industry details that are relevant to potential candidates. Use keywords that qualified candidates might search for to make sure the right people find out about your job. Include any required qualifications and skills you expect from applicants. Don't go overboard with requirements if they aren't crucial to job performance—you don't want to deter great candidates from applying. Try splitting qualifications and skills into two sections—\"Required\" and \"Preferred.\" Don't forget to list special perks and benefits, including PTO, 401K, free coffee, and medical coverage.
