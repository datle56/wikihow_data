      "content": "You need time to research and prepare a counter-offer. Thank the employer graciously for the offer and let them know you need time to think about it. That signals that you're interested in the position but that you're taking their offer seriously. Usually, they'll give you at least a couple of days to think it over. [1] X Research source For example, you might say \"Thank you so much for the offer. I certainly have a lot to think about. Would you mind if I give you an answer on Friday?\" If you're in a high-demand sector, the employer may not be willing to give you a lot of time—especially if they have others lined up who could also take the job. If you have a day or less, squeeze out every spare moment you can to work on your counter-offer."

      "content": "The employer expects you to negotiate for a higher salary. Often, employers intentionally low-ball you on the initial salary offer—and they aren't expecting you to just take it. They're expecting you to come back with what you really want so you can work together to (hopefully!) find a happy medium everyone is comfortable with. [2] X Research source This is where you might have to use the advice to \"fake it till you make it.\" It's fine if you don't have the confidence necessary to ask the employer for a higher salary, as long as you can pretend that you do! Remember that as the employer is listening to you, they're also gauging your willingness to engage and seek the best. They'll extrapolate your performance to how willing you'll be to give and get the best for the company. [3] X Expert Source Jonathan Soormaghen Career Coach Expert Interview. 7 October 2020."

      "content": "Look at salary guides online and talk to colleagues. Get an idea of what other people in your position are earning. This can help you figure out what kind of compensation package it would be reasonable to ask for. While salary guides can give you cold data, colleagues and other people in your industry can tell you more about other perks and benefits they get from their employers. [4] X Research source Mentors and former supervisors can also help you get a good idea of what you should expect. If you don't have a lot of contacts in your field, use a resource such as LinkedIn to talk to people in similar positions. [5] X Research source Take your geographic area into consideration as well. For example, a $60,000 salary will go a lot further in Cincinnati, OH than it will in San Francisco, CA. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Find out where there's flexibility so you can negotiate reasonably. Even if the company loves you and thinks you're the best person for the job, there are some constraints you just won't be able to get around. If the company is strapped for cash, it might not be able to offer the salary or benefits package you really want. Similarly, internal policies might prohibit them from offering you above a certain amount. [7] X Research source Navigate to the human resources page of the company's website and have a look around. This can help you get a sense of what aspects of the job offer might not be up for negotiation. If you feel relatively friendly with the person who made the offer, you might straight-up ask them how flexible the offer is or how much wiggle room they have. Some information is publicly available if you do a little research. If the job offer is from a publicly-traded corporation, you can find a lot of information about the company's financial health through required reports and disclosures. Look on the corporate website or the website of the regulatory agency that handles stock trading in your country."

Based on your research and your knowledge of your own background and experience, come up with a realistic salary range that you can use for negotiation.

For example, if your research shows that other people in your position make an average of $70,000 a year and the employer has offered you $50,000, you might create a range of $60,000 to $85,000. Add up your living expenses and create a budget (if you don't already have one). This will help you determine the minimum end of your range. [11] X Research source"

Everything your employer offers has a value, and some benefits might be more important to you than a few extra dollars on your paycheck. If you're willing to trade a higher salary for other perks, keep those ideas in your back pocket — you might be able to use them to get a better compensation package than what you were originally offered. [12] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Business Review Online and print journal covering topics related to business management practices Go to source Many things might be extremely valuable to you, such as flexible works hours or the ability to work from home, that won't really cost the employer anything. These perks can help you get a more favorable offer even if additional money isn't in the cards. Remember that when you negotiate a higher salary, you're negotiating the entire package at once. Your paycheck is only one facet of your overall compensation. For example, if you're not interested in the free gym membership the employer offers, you might be able to exchange that for a little more money."

[13] X Research source For example, you might say \"I appreciate the offer and look forward to working with you. However, $50,000 is below the market average for employees at my level. As we discussed during the interview, I have several high-profile clients I can bring on board with me, as well as national recognition for my work in social media.

They might ask you questions or immediately come back with a different figure.

However, the person extending the offer might not have complete control over the compensation package offered.

[17] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Business Review Online and print journal covering topics related to business management practices Go to source After you've given them time, wait for them to call you. If you call them before the time you gave them is up, you lose the power of your position. You could also potentially come across as desperate. If the time expires and you still haven't heard from them, it's okay to go ahead and give them a call. For example, if you gave them 2 days on Monday, you might call them on Thursday morning and say \"We left off discussing my compensation package on Monday. Have you had enough time to consider my counter-offer?\""

Your employer might be in a better position to decide on some aspects of your compensation package after you've been working with them for a few months. This is particularly true for non-monetary benefits, such as flex time or the ability to work from home. [18] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Business Review Online and print journal covering topics related to business management practices Go to source For example, suppose you asked your employer for permission to work from home on Fridays. Before they've hired you, they might not trust you to do that and maintain the appropriate level of production. However, after you've been working for them for 6 months, they're in a better position to decide if that's appropriate. When discussing these issues with the employer, acknowledge if you're willing to table something until later. You might say \"I understand you might have a hard time deciding whether to give me flex time right now. Would you be willing to revisit that issue in 6 months?\" Don't count on your employer to bring up the tabled issue again—be proactive and mention it yourself after the agreed-upon period has passed."
