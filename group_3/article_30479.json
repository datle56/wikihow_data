      "title": "Rub your hands and fingers together to warm your fingers.",
      "content": "Rub your hands and fingers together to warm your fingers. Warm hands and fingers are more comforting for the sinuses than cold hands and fingers. Cold hands and fingers can cause muscle tension. One option is to place a small amount of oil on your palm (about a quarter-sized amount). The oil helps to lessen the friction caused by your hands rubbing against your face. The scent of the oil may also help to promote relaxation. Good oils to use for a sinus massage include almond oil, baby oil, or castor oil. Just make sure to not get any of it in your eyes while you massage close to those areas."

When pressure is applied to this area, it can help to relieve colds, sinus congestion, frontal sinus headaches and tired eyes. Use your thumbs. The thumbs are recommended because they tend to be stronger than other fingers. For other people, using the index finger may be more comfortable. Do whatever feels the most soothing and comfortable for you."

      "content": "Try massaging your ethmoid/sphenoid sinuses. These are your nasal sinuses. Pour a small amount of massage oil or lotion onto your hands and rub them together to warm them up. Use your index fingers to stroke along the side of the bridge of your nose in a downward motion; this will help promote drainage. When you work your way up towards the top of your nose (the bridge), make small circles with your index fingers next to the corners of your eyes. However, do not touch your eyes or get oil into your eyes. The oil won't harm your eyes but you may experience stinging. Repeat this movement 10 times, all the while applying constant and firm pressure."

      "title": "Do a steam before or after a sinus massage.",
      "content": "Do a steam before or after a sinus massage. By combining the steam method described below along with the massage techniques already described, you can significantly increase sinus drainage. While increasing sinus drainage is not very pleasant, draining the excess mucus can relieve the pressure in your sinuses quickly and effectively. Steaming is an old method of relieving sinus pressure without chemicals or drugs. The steam helps open up the nasal passages and thin out the sometimes thick mucus, thereby enabling it to drain out of the sinuses."

Then remove the pot from the heat and place on a heat-resistant mat on a table.

In addition, keep any children away from the pot while it is boiling and while it is steaming. Try to do a steaming treatment when there aren't any children around. This method is for adults only — do not try it on children."

      "title": "Add herbs to your steaming treatment.",
      "content": "Add herbs to your steaming treatment. You can also add herbs and essential oils (one drop per quart of water ) to your steaming water. Some people think oils and herbs can relieve symptoms, but these claims are not backed by scientific evidence. Spearmint or peppermint, thyme, sage, lavender, and black lavender oil are all great options to start with.

Try each herb oil for about a minute and then take your face away from the steam for 10 minutes and assess how you feel. If you do have any adverse reactions (such as sneezing or a skin reaction like a rash), reheat the water and do the full treatment. If you don't have the essential oils, substitute a 1/2 teaspoon of dried herb per quart of water. For dried herbs, boil for another minute after adding, turn off the heat and move the pot to a safe area in your home and begin steaming."

      "title": "Take hot showers.",
      "content": "Take hot showers. Taking a long, hot shower can have a similar effect to the steam treatment above. The hot water from the shower creates warm, moist air that helps to clear out blocked nasal passages and relieve sinus pressure. Try blowing your nose naturally. The heat and steam will help moisten and liquify the secretions in the sinuses to better facilitate their evacuation. [10] X Research source You also achieve a similar beneficial effect by placing a warm compress on your face to help open up your nasal passages and relieve any pressure you might be feeling in your sinuses. Warm a moist washcloth in the microwave for two to three minutes. Always take care not to burn yourself. [11] X Research source"
