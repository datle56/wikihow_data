      "title": "Put ice in a plastic bag.",
      "content": "Put ice in a plastic bag. Put 3 to 4 pieces of ice in a plastic bag and seal it. If you donâ€™t have ice on hand, use a freezer pack instead. The bag helps contain the water from the melting ice cube. If you are concerned about the water leaking, double bag the ice. As an alternative to using ice, you can spray the area with compressed air to harden the chewing gum."

    {
      "title": "Freeze the gum.",
      "content": "Freeze the gum. Set the bag of ice directly on top of the gum. Let the ice sit on the gum for 5 minutes or until the gum becomes stiff and brittle. Ice will freeze, or harden, the gum. When gum is hard and not sticky, it is easier to remove. You can also hold the bag of ice against the gum. Prevent your hand from getting cold by placing a towel between the bag of ice and your palm."

    {
      "title": "Remove the hardened gum.",
      "content": "Remove the hardened gum. Use a dull putty knife, butter knife or blade to separate the frozen gum from the fabric of your car seat. The blade should remove all or most of the gum. Keep the blade flat to avoid poking holes in the fabric. Be patient. It may take awhile to separate the gum from the seat. Go slowly to avoid puncturing the fabric."

      "content": "Remove gum from cloth or vinyl car seats with white vinegar. Soak a small cloth in warm, white vinegar. Rub the saturated cloth on the gum. Allow the vinegar to soak into the gum for a few minutes. The vinegar will loosen the gum, causing it to ball up. Remove the softened, vinegar-soaked ball of gum with your fingers or a pair of tweezers. [1] X Research source Use this method to remove chewing gum from cloth or vinyl, but not leather. To quicken the process, warm up the vinegar first before applying it to the gum."
