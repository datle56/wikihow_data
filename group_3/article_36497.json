      "content": "Blink your eyes rapidly. When you get dust, hair, or another small foreign body stuck in your eye, your body’s natural response is to blink. Blinking rapidly may help move the debris and allow any tears that may form to clear it out. The more you blink and get yourself to tear up, the better chance you have of removing the particle. [2] X Trustworthy Source MedlinePlus Collection of medical information sourced from the US National Library of Medicine Go to source To blink, rapidly open and close your eyes. Although you may feel silly, the tears may naturally wash out the debris. If you cannot focus enough to get yourself to fake cry, then you can also try yawning to produce tears."

If you’re attempting to remove a small speck stuck beneath your eyelid, close the affected eye and gently pinch the skin of your upper eyelid. Pull the upper eyelid down slightly over the lower one. Roll your affected eye around in its socket. With luck, this motion (and the lashes from your lower lid) will loosen and dislodge something in your eye.

      "content": "Wash the eye with an eye wash solution . Commercially available eye wash solutions are useful for dislodging something from your eye. Eye wash solutions differ in their application process. Some use indirect application by filling a small eye cup with solution, then covering your eye with the eye cup and tilting your head back. Other solutions use a direct method, in which you tilt your head back, then drip or squirt solution directly from the bottle into your eye.

Otherwise, use a small bowl or cup full of water and splash the water into your open eye. You can also place your open eye under a gently-pouring faucet or shower to rinse it out. [7] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source Make sure to use cool water (not hot) and a gentle stream so you don’t injure your eye further.

Slip the cotton swab or corner of a clean cloth gently behind the eyelid and slowly roll your eye toward the back of your head.

If you’re unsure, which may occur if your eye is still red or irritated after the removal of the object, you could also check the surface of the cotton swab or cloth for something foreign.

If you can still feel something in your eye after rinsing your eye with eye wash solution and/or water, use a cotton swab or clean cloth moistened with eye wash solution or clean water to get it out. Always wipe in a gentle up or down motion, and never swipe across the eye. [9] X Research source To protect your cornea, look in the direction opposite the place where something is lodged in your eye. For instance, if something is in the right side of your eye, look toward the left. Check the cotton swab or cloth after each attempt at removal. If your cotton swab or cloth was white, you should be able to see the object on the cotton swab or cloth after it’s been removed. Rinse your eye once more with solution or clean water afterward."

[10] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Medical School Harvard Medical School's Educational Site for the Public Go to source If you are comfortable with it, you may want to have them use a cotton swab to dab the offending object out of your eye. Alternatively, you may invite them to administer eye drops or a cup of water to flush the eye. If you’re the helper, you can use 2 clean fingers to gently hold the person’s eye open. Have them carefully tilt their head side to side to help you see. Always ask for permission to help before touching somebody’s face or eye area."

If the item is very large or has punctured the eye to the point of bleeding and severe pain, this is a virtual guarantee you will need medical assistance. Pain is the most obvious sign that something in your eye is more than a mild irritant, though sometimes something in your eye can cause serious damage even in the absence of pain. Other symptoms to watch for include visible changes to the color of the eye, bleeding, abnormal, blurred, or absent vision, or discharge from the eye.
