[2] X Research source If you have a pear-shaped face : Your jawline should be the widest measurement. Your cheekbones should be slightly less wide than your jaw. Your forehead should be the narrowest measurement. A different way to determine your jawline measurement is to measure from just below your ear to the center of your chin. Then, multiply the measurement by 2. According to professional makeup artist Dr. Anjuli Yera, another way to find your face shape is to “divide your face into 2 halves” horizontally. Identify the shape of the top and bottom half and then put them together."
