      "content": "Hold the cap under hot water to make it more flexible. Place the bottle cap under the hot water for about a minute, and then dry it with a towel. Just be careful that you don’t burn yourself! Wrap a towel around the bottle before opening if the cap is too hot to grip with your bare hands. [1] X Research source Hot water will loosen the plastic cap, making it easier to unscrew the bottle. Don’t make the water too hot or run it over the cap for too long. This could potentially melt the cap or damage the bottle—or, at the very least, it could heat up the cold contents of your bottle, which would be unpleasant."

      "content": "Tap the cap against a hard surface to loosen it from the bottle. Firmly hold the bottle of water in your hand and hit the cap against a hard surface, such as the edge of a countertop. Tap the side of the cap against the surface to loosen it, rather than the top of the cap. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Ask a friend to open the bottle for you. If you can’t get the bottle cap to twist off on your own, it might be time to see if your friend or neighbor can help you out . Sure, it may hurt your pride, but the smooth, refreshing taste of water will soothe your wounded ego."

      "title": "Wrap a rubber band tightly around the cap.",
      "content": "Wrap a rubber band tightly around the cap. If you can’t get a good grip on the bottle, use a rubber band to offer you some traction. You probably have some rubber bands lying around your house, but if not, you can get some at a convenience store. [3] X Research source If you don't want to trek all the way to the store for rubber bands, try wrapping a hair tie, plastic wrap, or a rubber glove around the bottle, or anything else you've got at home that could offer some traction."

      "title": "Space the band’s loops evenly around the cap.",
      "content": "Space the band’s loops evenly around the cap. If the lengths of the rubber band are unevenly spaced on the bottle cap, it might be a little harder to grip it. Make the surface you’re gripping as smooth as you can by spacing the rubber band loops evenly around the lid. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Grip the bottle with your non-dominant hand. Grasp the bottle firmly with your fingers, but don’t squeeze the bottle, or else its contents will go everywhere once you open the lid. Grip the bottom part of the bottled water with your left hand if you’re right-handed, or right hand if you’re left-handed."

      "title": "Twist the cap counterclockwise with your other hand to break the seal.",
      "content": "Twist the cap counterclockwise with your other hand to break the seal. Use your dominant hand to twist until the cap becomes loose and breaks the seal. Make sure you’re holding the bottle tightly so only the cap twists, not the bottle. If the ridges on the cap are too sharp, use your shirt as a buffer between your hand and cap. Be careful not to hold your bottle at a downward-facing angle! You don't want to be mopping up the water once you get the cap off."

      "content": "Saw the seal with a sharp object, such as scissors or a knife. Scissors will probably be the easiest and safest, but you could also use a steak knife if you need to. Start a sawing motion, back and forth, with the blade along with the seal. Continue until you've broken the seal. [6] X Research source The seal is a thin plastic ring located at the very bottom of the cap—it’s attached to the cap via a perforated line. Be careful handling sharp objects!"

      "content": "Saw the rest of the seal, if needed, and remove the cap. If your bottle cap is still giving you trouble, use the blade to remove the entire seal. Once the whole seal is removed, there will be nothing keeping you from removing that lid and hydrating. [7] X Research source"
