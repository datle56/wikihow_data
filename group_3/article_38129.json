      "title": "Uhibbuka or Uhibbuki (أحبك) = “I love you”",
      "content": "Uhibbuka or Uhibbuki (أحبك) = “I love you” To say the phrase “I love you” in Arabic, you’d say uhibbuka when addressing a female and uhibbuki when addressing a female. Uhibbuka , the male-directed “I love you,” is roughly pronounced as “oo-heh-boo-kah.” while the female-directed “I love you,” uhibbuki , is roughly pronounced as “oo-heh-boo-kee.” [1] X Research source This phrase can be used platonically amongst friends and family, although it’s most commonly used in romantic relationships. Here are some examples of Arabic sentences with “I love you:” أحبك كثيرا ( 'Uhibuk kathiran ) = “I love you a lot.” هل تعرف كم أحبُك؟ ( Hal taerif kam 'uhibuka? ) = “Do you know how much I love you?” أنا أحبك من كل قلبي. ( 'Ana 'uhibuk min kuli qalbi ) = “I love you with all my heart.” To express a deep and sincere love for someone in Arabic, you would use the pronoun ana (meaning 'I') followed by the appropriate form of the verb 'uhibbu' (meaning 'I love'). For example, if you want to express deep love for a woman, say ana uhibbuki . For a male, say ana uhibbuka . While the Arabic script (أحبك) remains the same for both, the subtle difference lies in the tashkeel (vowel points) and the resulting pronunciation. 'أُحبكَ' uhibbuka is for men, and 'أُحبكِ' uhibbuki is for women. The Egyptian dialect of Arabic is slightly different. To say “I love you” to a male in Egyptian Arabic, you’d say bahibak (بَحبَكْ). To say “I love you” to a female, you’d say bahibik (بَحبِكْ). [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Tuqburnii (تقبرني) = “I love you so much”",
      "content": "Tuqburnii (تقبرني) = “I love you so much” A step up above the standard “I love you,” tuqburnii literally translates to “you bury me.” So, pretty intense! What this phrases really means is that you love someone so much that you’d rather die and be buried than lose them, so it’s similar to emotive English expressions of love like “I love you so much” or “I couldn’t live without you.” [3] X Research source Here are some examples of Arabic sentences with “I love you so much:” أحبك كثيرًا، تقبرني. ( 'Uhibuk kthyran, taqbaruni. ) = “I love you so much; I can’t live without you.” يا حبيبي، تقبرني. ( Ya habibi, taqbaruni. ) = “Oh, my love, I adore you..” تقبرني، أنت حياتي. ( Taqbiruni, 'ant hayati. ) = “You are my life; I can’t live without you.”"

      "title": "‘Ala raasii (على راسي) = “Anything for you”",
      "content": "‘Ala raasii (على راسي) = “Anything for you” While this Arabic phrase literally translates to “on my head,” it conveys your willingness to do anything for the one you love. You might say this in reply to your loved one asking you a favor to let them know that you’d go to the ends of the earth to ensure their happiness. This Arabic expression of love is pronounced as “ah-lah rah-see.” [4] X Research source Here are some examples of Arabic sentences with “Anything for you:” أنت على راسي.( 'Ant ealaa rasi ) = “You mean the world to me.” إذا كنت بحاجة إلى شيء، فأنت على راسي.( 'Iidha kunt bihajat 'iilaa shay'in, fa'ant ealaa rasi ) = “If you need anything, I’m here for you.” وجودك في حياتي على راسي.( Wujuduk fi hayaati ealaa rasi ) = “Having you in my life means a lot to me.”"

      "title": "Ya rouhi (يا روحي) = “My beloved”",
      "content": "Ya rouhi (يا روحي) = “My beloved” This affectionate term of endearment not only expresses your love as an action, but reveals to your lover how deeply you hold them dear—so much so that you’d call them your beloved or your “soul,” which is what this Arabic phrase translates directly to. Roughly pronounced as “ya roo-hee,” this sweet term of affection can be applied to anyone you love dearly. [5] X Research source Here are some examples of Arabic phrases with “My beloved:” يا روحي، كيف كان يومك؟ ( Ya ruhi, kayf kan yawmak? ) = “Oh, my beloved, how was your day?” يا روحي، أفتقدك. ( Ya ruhi, 'aftaqiduk ) = “Oh, my beloved, I miss you.” يا روحي، أنت أجمل شيء في حياتي. ( Ya ruhi, 'ant 'ajmal shay' fi hayati ) = “Oh, my beloved, you are the most beautiful thing in my life.”"

      "title": "Kalamak/ik ‘asal ‘ala qalbi (كلامك عسل على قلبي) = “Your words are honey on my heart”",
      "content": "Kalamak/ik ‘asal ‘ala qalbi (كلامك عسل على قلبي) = “Your words are honey on my heart” This Arabic phrase is another way to say “I love you,” but its literal translation is much more involved and complex. If someone compliments you or declares their love for you in Arabic, you might convey your mutual strongness of feeling by saying kalamak/ik ‘asal ‘ala qalbi , which compares their sweet words to delicious honey. [6] X Research source Here are some examples of Arabic phrases with “Your words are honey on my heart:” كلامك عسل على قلبي، شكرًا لك. ( Kalamuk easal ealaa qalbi, shkran lak ) = “Your words are like honey to my heart, thank you.” أحب سماع كلامك، هو عسل على قلبي. ( 'Uhibu samae kalamika, hu easal ealaa qalbi ) = “I love hearing your words; they are like honey to my heart.” كلامك يجعلني سعيدًا، هو عسل على قلبي. ( Kalamuk yajealuni seydan, hu easal ealaa qalbi ) = “Your words make me happy; they are like honey to my heart.”"

      "title": "‘Ant hayati (أنت حياتي) = “You are my life”",
      "content": "‘Ant hayati (أنت حياتي) = “You are my life” This expression of adoration and affection is the perfect way to tell someone just how much you love them. In fact, you can tell them that they’re the most important thing in your life—or just your life itself! If you can’t imagine your life without a certain someone, this is a great phrase to share your feelings. [7] X Research source Here are some examples of Arabic phrases with “You are my life:” أنت حياتي وحبي ( ‘Ant hayaati wahubiy ) = “You are my life and my love.” أنت حياتي، لا أستطيع العيش بدونك. ( ‘Ant hayati, la 'astatie aleaysh bidunka. ) = “You are my life; I can’t live without you.” أنت كل شيء بالنسبة لي. أنت حياتي. ( ‘Ant kulu shay' bialnisbat lay.

      "content": "Habibi or Habibti (حبيبي / حبيبتي) = “My love” This term of endearment is one of the most common in Arabic, and it’s also widely known worldwide. Habibi (for males) and habibti (for females) are generally used to express deep romantic affection, although they can also be used to refer affectionately to close friends and family. [8] X Research source Another term for “my love” is hobbi (حبي), which is very common in music and poetry and especially used in the Egyptian dialect of Arabic.

      "title": "Qalbi (يا قلبي) = “My heart”",
      "content": "Qalbi (يا قلبي) = “My heart” This sweet phrase comes from the Arabic word for “heart,” which is qalb (قلب). By calling someone your “heart,” you’re conveying affection, closeness, and an adoring love for this other person. Romantic partners may frequently use this term of endearment, but it’s also commonly heard among close friends and family members when speaking Arabic . Here are some example Arabic phrases using “My heart:” [10] X Research source أنت قلبي، أحبك جدًا. ( 'Ant qalbi, 'uhibuk jdan ) = “You are my heart; I love you so much.” قلبي، كيف حالك اليوم؟ ( Qalbi, kayf haluk alyawm? ) = “My heart, how are you today?” قلبي، أنت كل شيء بالنسبة لي ( Qalbi, 'ant kulu shay' bialnisbah li ) = “My heart, you are everything to me.”"

      "content": "Ayuni / Eyuni (عيوني) = “My eyes” Eyes have a huge symbolic importance to Arab culture, so it’s no wonder that referring to someone as your “eyes” can be a great way to express your love. This phrase is similar to the English “light of my eyes” or “apple of my eye,” and it especially appears in literature written in classical Arabic. Classically romantic, you might say! [11] X Research source Here are some example Arabic phrases using “My eyes:” عيوني ما أقدر أعيش من دونك ( Eyuni ma 'aqdir 'aeish min dunik ) = “My eyes, I can’t live without you.” أنت عيوني وحياتي ( 'Ant ayuni wahayati ) = “You are my eyes and my life.” أحبك يا نور عيني ( 'Uhibuk ya nur eayni ) = “I love you, oh light of my eyes.”"

      "content": "Ya Kinzi (يا كنزي) = “My treasure” If you want to tell someone just how precious they are to you, you’ve come to the right place! Calling someone your “treasure” in Arabic will let them know just how highly you prize them in your life. This phrase can also be equated to the English terms “my dear” and “my precious.” [12] X Research source Here are some example Arabic phrases using “My treasure:” أنت كنز قلبي ( 'Ant kanz qalbi ) = “You are the treasure of my heart.” أنت كنزي ( 'Ant kanzi ) = “You’re my treasure.” سأكون هنا دائمًا من أجلك يا كنزي ( Sa'akun huna dayman min 'ajlik ya kanzi ) = “I’ll always be here for you, my treasure.” In the Egyptian dialect of Arabic, you can also refer to males as ghali (غالي) and females as ghalia (غالية) to call them “my precious.”"

      "content": "‘Amiri / ‘Amira (أميري / أميرتي) = “Prince” / “Princess” Is there a higher expression of admiration than referring to someone as actual royalty? We don’t think so! In Arabic, you can refer to someone as a prince with the term ‘amiri or as a princess with the term ‘amira to tell them just how regal you think that they are! [13] X Research source Here are some example Arabic phrases using “My prince/princess:” أميري، كيف كان يومك؟ ( 'Amiri, kayf kan yawmak? ) = “My prince, how was your day?” أميرتي، أتمنى لك أحلامًا سعيدة.
