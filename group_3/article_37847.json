      "content": "Take a hot shower to soften your back hair. Back hair (like all body hair) tends to be more wiry and coarse than the hair on your head. A hot, steamy shower will soften and also remove any oils, dirt, and other grime that might make the hair more difficult to shave . Then, let your skin and hair dry completely before you pick up your electric trimmer. [1] X Research source While you're showering, you may also want to exfoliate your back by scrubbing it with a washcloth, a loofah, or a soft bristle brush. Taking this extra step will help remove dead skin cells and create a smoother surface for electric trimmers to work on. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Reach over your shoulder and shave your upper back hair. Turn on your electric body trimmer (also called hair clippers ), attach a guard, and grip it firmly in your right hand. Next, reach over your right shoulder and shave the part of your shoulder and upper back you can reach in slow, steady motions. Then pass the trimmers to your left hand and repeat the same steps on the other side of your upper back. [4] X Research source Shave against the grain, meaning against the hair growth. Normally you wouldn't want to do this, but because you're using a guard, you're not breaking the surface of the skin. [5] X Research source A guard is a detachable comb that clips onto the razor. It prevents the blades from directly contacting your skin and causing irritating razor burns and ingrown hairs . Be careful when shaving around sensitive spots like scars, moles, and acne. Avoid applying too much pressure to these areas so they don't become more irritated or bleed."

To trim your mid to lower back hair, hook one arm behind your back and run the electric trimmers (guard on) carefully over the hair you can reach in slow, steady downward passes (i.e., with the growth of the hair this time). Then switch to your other hand and do the same thing on the other side. [6] X Research source Check how you're doing using the mirrors around you. If you miss any spots, you can always ask your partner or a trusted family member or friend to clean up the remaining hair.

[8] X Research source That shouldn't happen if you put a guard on your electric trimmer, but irritation and bumps can still pop up even with the most sensitive shavers. It also makes your skin smell good and feel smoother to the touch – all great things when it comes to manscaping! Once again, you may find it easier if someone applies the aftershave to your back for you rather than contorting yourself to apply it on your own."

      "title": "Hair removal cream",
      "content": "Hair removal cream Use a hair removal cream like Nair if you want to get rid of back hair at home without trimmers. Wash your back with soap and warm water first, then let your hair and skin dry. Next, apply a thick layer of hair removal cream to your back hairs and let it sit for the amount of time specified on the bottle's instructions. Finally, gently wipe off the cream with a damp washcloth or a spatula. Some redness and itching is normal after using a hair removal cream. But if it gets unbearable or continues for more than a few hours, see your doctor. Avoid applying hair removal cream to moles, scars, cuts, scrapes, or irritated or sunburned skin. You may want to stick to shaving with electric trimmers if you have sensitive skin. Hair removal creams contain harsh chemicals that can sometimes cause a bad reaction in some people."

The plus side of this alternative is after 2-6 treatments every 12-16 weeks, you should notice a significant decrease in hair growth that could last months or possibly years. The downside is it can cause redness and swelling, and you'll also have to avoid sunlight between treatments as much as possible.

This means you'll be shedding a lot, so keep a lint roller handy! Reduce any redness and irritation immediately after your laser treatment by applying ice packs to your skin. Your doctor may also prescribe a steroid cream."

[12] X Research source During a wax appointment, a licensed esthetician or barber will apply wax to your hair, let it dry, then lay a cloth over it. Then they'll quickly remove the cloth and (hopefully) take up the wax and the hair underneath along with it.

The top of your head is the most important part to get right, so tackle it first by shaving in the opposite direction of whichever way your hair naturally grows.

Attach a guard to your trimmer avoid shaving it too close or remove the guard completely if you want a buzz cut. For example, if you want to leave 1 ⁄ 8 in (0.32 cm) of length on your hair, use a number 1 guard. If you'd rather leave 1 ⁄ 4 in (0.64 cm) of length, use a number 2 guard. [15] X Research source"
