      "content": "Wash your item thoroughly if it has dirt, grease, or grime on it. Wet your item with cool water from a faucet or hose, and use a microfiber cloth to wipe it down. Spray an all-purpose metal cleaner onto the surface, and wipe it down with a microfiber cloth. Rinse away any dirt and dry the surface before you apply paint. [1] X Research source To remove stubborn residue, use a heavy-duty car cleaner and a soft scrub brush. If you are painting an item such as a car emblem, unscrew it from the car so you can easily clean it."

      "content": "Protect your workspace by using painter's tape and a drop cloth. To prevent getting paint on your workspace, lay sheets of newspaper across the table, or cover the surrounding areas with a drop cloth. This will depend on what exactly you are painting. You can use painter’s tape to cover any surface you don’t want to be painted. Rip 4–6 in (10–15 cm) of tape, and place it anywhere you’d like. [2] X Research source For instance, if you are painting the rims of your car, remove the rims from the tires, stretch out a plastic drop cloth, and place the rims on top. You can also cover the back of the rims with painter's tape to keep the inside silver."

      "content": "Shake up the paint can for 10-20 seconds. To help mix up your primer, move it back and forth quickly for a few seconds. There is a small metal ball inside the paint can that helps mix up the paint. [3] X Research source If you don’t mix up the paint before you spray it on, it may spray unevenly at first."

      "title": "Spray on a solid coat of black paint primer.",
      "content": "Spray on a solid coat of black paint primer. Applying the primer helps the paint stick to the chrome. It also ensures the paint stays on if exposed to a car wash or heavy rainfall, for instance. To apply the primer, hold the can about 3–5 in (7.6–12.7 cm) from your item, and cover the surface in an even layer. [4] X Research source If you are painting an automobile, ensure you have auto primer, rather than an all-purpose primer. Your chrome will look matte and dark instead of silver and shiny. It is okay if there are some uneven patches, as you’ll apply several layers of paint."

      "title": "Wait about 20 minutes for your paint to dry.",
      "content": "Wait about 20 minutes for your paint to dry. Before you apply the next layer of paint, let your primer sit for a few minutes. If you apply paint while the primer is wet, each coat may not dry evenly."

      "title": "Pick the correct paint based on the item you are covering.",
      "content": "Pick the correct paint based on the item you are covering. If you are painting a chrome item, use black spray paint. If you are painting a non-chrome item, use a black spray paint with a chrome finish. In addition, ensure you use the correct paint for the type of material you are painting. For instance, If you are painting black chrome on your car, be sure you have auto spray paint. This is specially formulated to stick to cars and withstand the elements. If spraying craft metal, use an all-purpose spray paint safe for metal surfaces. Be sure to shake up the paint can before you spray it. This way, you can apply a smooth, even layer of paint.

You can set a timer if that is helpful. [7] X Research source If you spray your next layer immediately after your first, the paint may not dry properly and you may have uneven sections. You can touch the tip of your finger to the side of your item to check if the paint is dry. If any paint comes off onto your fingertip, let the paint sit for another 5-10 minutes."

Hold the can about 3–5 in (7.6–12.7 cm) away from your item. Start on the side and work your way across to the right side to ensure you cover each spot. [8] X Research source It may be a bit difficult to see exactly where you apply the paint, as your black paint may look slightly shiny. The clear coat protects the black chrome layer so the color doesn’t rub off over time."
