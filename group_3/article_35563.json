      "content": "Drop your mattress topper off at a recycling center. Throwing your foam topper into the garbage can be detrimental to the environment. Instead, find local recycling centers and ask them to point you in the direction of recycling programs and dropoff sites for memory foam. Don't set it out with your standard recyclables, as it needs to be processed in a specialized facility. Visit Home for Foam for dropoff and pick-up locations: https://www.homeforfoam.com/foam-101/foam-recycling-centers ."

      "content": "Contact your mattress topper's manufacturer and ask about a recycling program. Some memory foam manufacturers will take your old foam bedding through buy-back or disposal agreements. Check your warranty and look for information on these kinds of transactions.

If you purchased your topper from a local store, call and ask if they can recycle if for you."

      "content": "Call your municipality's board of health and inquire about a recycling. Many public works departments and local health boards have recycling programs that specifically subsidize mattress recycling. Although created for mattress recycling, most of them also take related materials, including foam, steel, and wood, which are separated and used in new products.

      "content": "Give your mattress topper to a friend or family member. If your topper is in good enough condition, give it to a family member or friend. Ask around and see if anyone is willing to take it. If not, you can move on to local charities or online classified sites. If you're unsure of your topper's condition, ask yourself: would I sleep on it? If not, it's probably not in good enough condition for someone else."

      "title": "Post an ad for your mattress topper online.",
      "content": "Post an ad for your mattress topper online. Classified sites like Craigslist and Kijiji are great places to find a new home for your memory foam mattress topper. You can also use social media channels like Facebook to connect with friends and locals. Both of these options are great way to find people in your area who are looking for a mattress topper. Post a clear picture of any damages or stains on your mattress topper. If you want, specify in your posting that the deal is pick-up only, which means you aren't willing to drop it off. However, remember there is always some danger in letting strangers come to your home. Try and have a close friend or family member with you when they arrive."

      "content": "Create a dog or cat bed if you have pets. Cut your memory foam topper down to a size that is reasonable for your dog or cat. Either wrap it in some sheets or sew some fabric around it and you can use it as a cheap alternative to branded dog beds.

Purchase frames with wheels to make it easier to move around your home."

      "title": "Use your memory foam as a beanbag chair stuffing alternative.",
      "content": "Use your memory foam as a beanbag chair stuffing alternative. Many beanbag chairs are actually stuffed with memory foam, making this a great way to reuse your memory foam mattress topper. Cut the foam up into smaller pieces (about 2 inches (5.1 cm) long), unzip your chair, and replace some or all of the old stuffing. Beanbag chairs are typically made from expanded polystyrene, expanded polypropylene, compressed foam, memory foam, or various other materials. Memory foam is a great replacement if these materials start to age, or if you just want to try something new."

      "title": "Use it for padding under sleeping bags on camping trips.",
      "content": "Use it for padding under sleeping bags on camping trips. Memory foam heats up according to body temperature, which can be a great portable heating solution when you're camping. When temperatures start to dip, use your memory foam as a cushion under your sleeping bags to keep warm. They're also easy to compress and roll up. Standard memory foam is best since it reacts to temperature the most due to its tight cell structure. Both gel and plant-based are less reactive to heat, and thus not as effective for heating."

      "content": "Cut them into rectangular lumbar support pillows for desk chairs and vehicles. Cut your foam down to a small size that comfortably fits behind your back while you sit. Put them into a standard size pillow case and hold it together using elastic headbands. The rectangular pillow should be placed horizontally behind your lower back to prevent the natural slouch that affects this region when you sit. [6] X Research source Outdoor fabric, canvas, and cotton duck are great durable fabric choices."
