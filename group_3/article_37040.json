You may also cut through some paint while doing this, but that’s okay. Cut all the way around the trim to free it. Make sure to cut all the way through the caulking to avoid damaging the paint when you pry off the trim. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Use a pry bar to pull off the trim. Slide the edge of the pry bar under the trim near a nail. If needed, tap a hammer against the back of the bar to help wedge it in. Pull back one piece of trim at a time, taking care not to damage the walls and door jamb. It doesn’t matter which side you start on, as long as you remove all the pieces you want to replace. [2] X Research source To protect the walls, hold a scrap of wood against the wall and rest the back of the pry bar against it as you work. There’s not really a way to protect the jamb besides being very careful when leveraging the trim."

      "title": "Measure the new trim against the door.",
      "content": "Measure the new trim against the door. First, purchase some trim from the home improvement store. Most trim comes in 8 or 10 ft (2.4 or 3.0 m) sections. If you want to install the same type of trim as your original, Zakar says, “I would take a piece of it with me to the home store and get a new trim.” [4] X Expert Source Barry Zakar Handyman Expert Interview. 16 July 2020. Use your old trim as a sizing guide or hold the new trim against the door frame. Mark the measurements with a pencil so you know how to size the trim. [5] X Research source Alternatively, measure out the space around the door with a tape measure if the other options aren’t possible. Measure out the length and width of the trim space on all sides of the door to find out how much trim you need. Narrower trim can be a good choice for simplicity and appearance, but make sure you leave enough material to cover the gap between the door frame and the wall. Wider trim stands out more, but it’ll cover more of the wall. Make sure you have enough space for it."

Cut a large piece of trim into the top piece and one of the sides. [7] X Research source It’s okay to leave the trim a little long at first. You can adjust this as needed later. It’s helpful to practice using the miter saw on scrap wood first. You are usually able to adjust the saw more than you expect to get a better-fitting joint."

On the outside part, which attaches to the wall, use 6d or 2 in (5.1 cm) finishing nails to secure the trim. [11] X Research source Avoid placing the nails close to the ends of the trim. Depending on the thickness of your trim, you may need larger nails. Hold the nails up to the trim to see if they're long enough to go all the way through to the wall."

Measure down the side pieces and drill a hole through each from the outside edge. Hold a piece of cardboard against the wall to prevent your tools from damaging it."

[13] X Research source Depending on how much trim you’re replacing, Zakar adds that you may “have to reinstall the latch hardware, the strike plate. If you’re replacing just the trim that’s on the wall, you don’t need to replace the strike plate because that’s on the original.” [14] X Expert Source Barry Zakar Handyman Expert Interview. 16 July 2020."

Spread the caulk with a putty knife or your fingers, then go around the outside of the trim, squeezing a small bead of caulk between the trim and the wall. Zakar advises, “If you’ve got a new tube of caulk, be careful that you don’t cut the end too large. You don’t want too much caulk coming out, or there’ll be too much excess, and it makes a mess.” [15] X Expert Source Barry Zakar Handyman Expert Interview. 16 July 2020. Run your finger along the bead of caulk to smooth it out, then wipe it clean on a wet rag. Let the caulk dry before painting or staining. Check the label information to find out how long this takes."

Color the trim with primer and a layer of paint, or retain the appearance of the wood by using a commercial staining product . [16] X Research source Use an oil or latex-based primer before painting over wood. According to Newman, if you want to paint a door frame, “You have to lightly sand everything and rough up the surface a little bit, or the paint will not adhere as well as it should.” [17] X Expert Source Mitchell Newman Construction & Interior Design Specialist Expert Interview. 7 June 2019."

      "content": "Replacing door trim is easy to do if you have basic carpentry skills. This DIY task requires basic carpentry skills, like measuring, cutting, and nailing. As long as you have basic tools and a willingness to learn, you'll be able to tackle the project easily. The hardest part is making precise cuts to ensure the trim fits snugly. In general, replacing interior trim is easier than replacing exterior trim, especially if you’re dealing with rotting or damaged wood. If you don’t have carpentry skills, it’s probably better to hire someone to replace the trim until you gain more experience."
