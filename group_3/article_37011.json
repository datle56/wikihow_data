      "content": "Cut through the band where it sits on one of the slingshot’s arms. Use a sharp knife to make a vertical cut where the band sits on the vertical part of the slingshot’s metal arm. Slice the band horizontally where it sits on the horizontal tip of the arm. [1] X Research source Try to cut just deep enough to slice through the slingshot band without scratching the metal arm underneath it. A pocket knife with a serrated blade works well for this, but you can use any sharp blade you have available. For example, an X-ACTO knife or a boxcutter would also work."

[2] X Research source You don’t have to be gentle or try to preserve the band in any way. Just pull and tear the band off the arm."

[3] X Research source If you haven’t bought a replacement band yet, you can keep the old band to use as a reference when you’re shopping for a new one, if you want the same style of band."

      "content": "Purchase a replacement slingshot band that fits your slingshot. Visit a sporting goods store or search online using keywords like \"slingshot replacement band\" to find a new band. Buy the band at the store or order it online when you find one that you like. Slingshot bands come in standard sizes that fit most slingshots. A normal band will cost you about $5 USD, while something like a high-velocity band can cost around $10."

      "content": "Pour about 1 in (2.5 cm) of isopropyl alcohol into a cup. Open up a bottle of isopropyl alcohol and pour it in a cup or mug. The alcohol is for lubricating the slingshot arms, so that you can actually slide the new band onto them. [4] X Research source Isopropyl alcohol is the recommended lubricant for this process because it is slippery enought to let you slide the band onto the arms, but will evaporate and dry up quickly, leaving the band securely attached to the arms. The higher the percentage of the alcohol, the faster it will dry after you put your new band on your slingshot. Use at least 70%-strength isopropyl alcohol. Use 90-99%-strength alcohol for the best results, if you can find it."

Push and slide the other side of the slingshot band all the way onto the arm until it won’t go any further. [7] X Research source It’s important to put the band all the way on the arms, past the bend in the arms, so that it will stay on securely when you use the slingshot. Don’t ever just slide the band onto the tips of the arms."
