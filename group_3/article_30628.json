      "content": "Be wary of the results from thermometer apps for iPhone or Android. Few smartphones have the right equipment to accurately read room temperature—their sensors only monitor the battery temperature and are affected by heat radiating from the phone. This means that thermometer apps can only give rough, often inaccurate estimates of room temperature unless they’re designed with a specific ambient temperature sensor. [1] X Research source Some popular thermometer apps include Room Temperature Thermometer , HD Thermometer , and Real Thermometer . Some phones with external temperature sensors are the Samsung Galaxy S4, Samsung Galaxy Note 3, Motorola Moto X, Huawei Ascend P6, and Xiaomi Mi3. The number of phones with accurate sensors has been declining since it’s not a popular or easy to manufacture feature."

      "content": "Get an external temperature sensor or weather station for your phone. For accurate readings, connect your phone to an external thermometer. Look for devices that connect to WiFi or Bluetooth—many can also read humidity, air quality, and more. Then, download the accompanying app to your phone so you can read results and adjust settings from the palm of your hand. [2] X Research source WiFi models are more expensive than Bluetooth ones, which can only work if your phone is within a certain distance of the sensor device. External sensors and weather stations can also be connected to an Amazon Alexa or Google Home system if you have one."

Depending on the product, you may have to create an account to sync the device with the app. Make sure you’re connected to the same WiFi network as your external device if it uses WiFi. If it uses Bluetooth, connect your devices to enable use. [3] X Research source"

The app’s display will look different depending on which device you’re using, but the temperature reading will be easy to find. Make sure you’re looking at the room or ambient temperature and not the weather forecast.

      "content": "Try a digital thermometer for the most accurate temperature reading. Electronic and digital thermometers are pricier than other types, but they provide the fastest and most precise temperature readings. They react to air temperature changes very quickly, so you’ll always be confident in the current temperature. [5] X Research source Some digital models store temperature data over a certain period of time so you can evaluate changes in the room’s temperature."

      "content": "Use a classic glass thermometer for approximate temperature readings. Opt for one that doesn’t contain mercury, since it’s highly toxic and dangerous if the thermometer ever breaks. [6] X Trustworthy Source United States Environmental Protection Agency Independent U.S. government agency responsible for promoting safe environmental practices Go to source These thermometers use a glass tube (a capillary) with a liquid inside. As the temperature rises, the liquid expands and moves farther up the tube. [7] X Research source These thermometers are slower to adjust to temperature changes than digital ones and can only provide an approximation of the ambient temperature. Glass thermometers are also called bulb or liquid-in-glass thermometers."

      "content": "Try a bimetallic thermometer for a decorative or easy-to-read option. These thermometers have a display dial with a pointer (similar to a clockface) that moves to show you the temperature. They have a metal strip that expands and bends as the room temperature rises, which moves the pointer on the dial. [8] X Research source The large pointer on the dial makes it easy to see the temperature from far away. However, bimetallic thermometers aren’t as accurate as digital ones. Bimetallic thermometers can look relatively plain or be made to look like compasses, clocks, sundials, or feature other designs."

      "content": "Put the thermometer in the center of the room, at least 2 ft (0.61 m) high. This is the ideal spot to get an accurate reading since it’s sitting height for most people and away from the heat or cold of floors and walls. Make sure there are no drafts or heat sources near the thermometer, since these will throw off the reading. Try setting the thermometer on a table or stool to keep it off the (usually cold) floor. Keep the thermometer out of direct sunlight, which will produce a warmer reading."

      "content": "Wait 5 minutes for the thermometer to adjust to the room temperature. Back away from the thermometer so your body heat doesn’t influence the reading. Most thermometers, especially glass or bimetallic ones, will take at least several minutes to adjust to changing temperatures. [9] X Research source Digital thermometers work fast and may show results in about 1-2 minutes."

[10] X Research source For most people, a comfortable room temperature is somewhere between 18–24º C (64–75º F). [11] X Research source Digital thermometers: Read the numbers on the digital display to see the temperature. This reading is the most accurate. Glass thermometers: Read the number or tick mark closest to the top of the liquid in the tube. Keep your eyes level with the top of the liquid for accuracy. Bimetallic thermometers: Look at the number or tick mark that the pointer is pointing to, similar to how you would read an analog clock."
