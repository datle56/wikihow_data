[1] X Research source You may get sick days, vacation time, and/or paid time off, but sometimes you just need a break. Playing hooky is all about leaving work/school or taking the day off when you’re physically well but mentally exhausted. In other words, you’re not in the mood to work, so you skip your duties for a few hours or the whole day. Believe it or not, playing hooky can benefit your mental and physical health. It's easy to feel burnt out when you work full-time, and time off can help you recharge, reset, and be more productive.

But whatever it was passed, thank goodness!” “I woke up to the toilet overflowing! Thankfully, I stopped and fixed it myself, but I didn’t want to leave and return to a flooded apartment if it started again.” “There was a family emergency, but everything’s alright. Thank you for giving me the day.”"
