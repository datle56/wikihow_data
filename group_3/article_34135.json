      "content": "Wear pants that are the proper size. Whether you’re wearing jeans, leggings, or other pants, one of the easiest ways to prevent camel toe is to make sure they aren’t too tight. Try your pants on to make sure you can move and sit comfortably in them, especially in the crotch area. Remember that it’s normal for weight to fluctuate, so don’t stress if you need to size up from what you normally wear. [1] X Research source Consider the rise of your jeans as well. Some people experience camel toe more often if they wear high-waisted jeans or pants. This applies to swimwear, as well. Too-small swimsuit bottoms are especially prone to camel toe. Note that wearing leggings that are too loose can also cause camel toe, as the excess material may bunch up around your crotch."

      "title": "Choose loose, breathable fabrics.",
      "content": "Choose loose, breathable fabrics. Camel toe is likely to be worse when wearing stretchy, synthetic materials like yoga pants or other workout gear. Opt for more breathable fabrics whenever possible, and buy clothing (especially workout clothing) that has built-in lining at the crotch. This extra layer will help reduce the appearance of camel toe. [2] X Research source To avoid camel toe, it’s usually best to stay away from 100% Spandex. Avoid linen and polyester fabrics, as well, especially if it’s warm out."

      "title": "Wear underwear.",
      "content": "Wear underwear. If you want to avoid camel toe, don’t go commando; going without underwear will increase the chances you’ll have this problem, especially if you’re wearing pants made of thin, stretchy material or light-colored fabric. For even better results, go for low-rise panties , seamless underwear , or underwear with a crotch lining . [3] X Research source Wearing thicker panties is less likely to cause camel toe because they won’t get pulled into your private parts as easily. Thicker panties also provide some support and help smooth out lines."

    {
      "title": "Go for leggings or pants made of thick fabrics.",
      "content": "Go for leggings or pants made of thick fabrics. Thinner materials have less of a barrier between your skin and tend to emphasize the crotch area as the fabric can easily fold around your labia. To prevent this, choose thicker leggings or yoga pants that are opaque and matte enough that you can’t see your underwear through them. [4] X Research source Don’t wear tights as leggings, as they’re especially see-through. If you’re wearing leggings as pants, consider wearing a long shirt, sweater, or tunic for extra protection. Shapewear leggings can also help, as they work to smooth bulges and unevenness in the stomach, legs, and the area in between."

      "title": "Opt for dark colors or patterned fabrics.",
      "content": "Opt for dark colors or patterned fabrics. Black and dark colors help hide certain parts of your body, including your camel toe, so choosing dark colors is especially helpful if you want to wear leggings or other tight-fitting bottoms. Similarly, some patterns can “confuse” the eye and help disguise camel toe. [5] X Research source Fashion expert Melissa Young agrees that thin, unsupported polyester or yoga pants in a light color are the worst possible fabrics for camel toe. White and light beige fabrics often leave nothing to the imagination, especially with non-tailored yoga pants or other stretchy fabrics. This is why it’s best to avoid them if you want to prevent or hide camel toe."

      "title": "Wear leggings with liners or gussets.",
      "content": "Wear leggings with liners or gussets. Leggings with a reinforced gusset, like leakproof leggings , have extra material around the crotch to reduce friction and cushion the area. This extra material often helps prevent camel toe, as it is thicker than normal legging material. Additionally, leggings with gussets typically have an oval- or diamond-shaped seam rather than a straight seam, which can also help reduce the appearance of camel toe. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Put on a panty liner. Wearing a panty liner is a quick fix if you know your pants give you a camel toe or if you’ve already left the house once you realize it. Simply stick the panty liner to your underwear as you normally would to conceal creasing. The thick material should prevent your bottoms from bunching up around your crotch. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Consider wearing cycling underwear. Cycling underwear is made of thick material with sewn-in foam pads to reduce friction and soreness when riding a bike. The extra padding helps prevent camel toe when you wear leggings, bike shorts, or other tight pants. Alternatively, look for bike shorts with built-in chamois if you typically wear bike shorts more than leggings. [8] X Research source"

If you need a quick DIY hack to hide your camel toe, find a bra cup pad you no longer use and cut it into a triangle small enough to fit in the liner or pocket of your panties.
