      "content": "There is no way to see which users saved your Instagram posts . While having a Business or Creator account can show you metrics including how many people saved and shared your posts, it's not possible to see who saved or shared your posts. If you're looking for an alternative, your only option is to ask your followers if they've saved your posts. You can do this by posting a story , creating a reel, or even creating a new Instagram post to poll your users. There is no guarantee that the person(s) who saved your post will respond, but it gives them the option to send you a direct message."
