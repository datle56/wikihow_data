      "content": "Remove any labels, then clean the jars. Peel off any labels or price tags first. Wash the jars thoroughly with soap and water, then pat them dry. As an extra precaution, it would be a good idea to wipe them down with rubbing alcohol as well. [1] X Research source The benefit to using this method is that you can fill the jars with water, then add fresh flowers. The drawback to using this method is that you may end up with some visible brushstrokes."

      "content": "Apply 2 coats of acrylic craft paint or paint made specifically for glass. [2] X Expert Source Nicole Bolin Crafts & DIY Specialist Expert Interview. 9 September 2020. Apply the first coat, let it dry, then apply the second coat. It should take about 20 minutes for the first coat to dry. You can do this with a paintbrush or a foam brush. Once the jar dries, you can flip it over and apply 2 coats of the same paint to the bottom. [3] X Research source Work systematically from top-to-bottom. Make your coats light to reduce brushstrokes. You can always add a third one. Stick your hand inside the jar to turn it. This way, you won't get your fingers dirty or leave behind fingerprints in the paint."

      "title": "Allow the paint to dry overnight.",
      "content": "Allow the paint to dry overnight. Some types of acrylic craft paint are actually enamel-based, meaning that it needs time to cure. In most cases, you will need to wait 20 days. Check the label to be sure. [4] X Research source You can tell if the paint is enamel-based either by looking at the label or at the drying instructions on the back. If the instructions say that the paint needs to cure for several days, it's enamel-based. If you are using regular acrylic craft paint, just let it dry overnight."

      "content": "Distress the jars with sandpaper for a rustic look, if desired. Lightly buff the threading along the top of the jar with 120-grit sandpaper. Use the same sandpaper on the bottom of the jar. Buff any raised areas using 100-grit sandpaper. If your mason jar has a raised design, such as the word \"Ball,\" you can sand it using an emery board. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Seal the jar with 2 coats of acrylic sealer.",
      "content": "Seal the jar with 2 coats of acrylic sealer. The finish you use is up to you. Use a glossy sealer for a shiny finish. If you distressed the jar, a satin or matte sealer would look better. A spray-on sealer will give you the nicest finish, but you can use the paint-on kind as well. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Allow the sealer to dry and cure before using the jar.",
      "content": "Allow the sealer to dry and cure before using the jar. Because you only painted the outside of the jar, you can use it as a vase for fresh flowers. If the jar gets dirty on the outside, wipe it down with a damp cloth. Never scrub the jar or leave it standing in water, or the paint will come off."

      "title": "Clean the inside of the jar with soap and water, then dry it off.",
      "content": "Clean the inside of the jar with soap and water, then dry it off. It would be a good idea to wipe the inside of the jar down with rubbing alcohol to remove any oils that may prevent the paint from sticking. If your jar has any stickers or labels, you should remove them at this point as well. The nice thing about using this method is that you get a clean finish without any brushstrokes. The downside to using this method is that you cannot fill the jar with water and use it as a vase."

      "title": "Pour some acrylic craft paint into the jar.",
      "content": "Pour some acrylic craft paint into the jar. How much you pour in depends on the size of your jar; the bigger your jar is, the more paint you will need. A little bit of this paint goes a long way, however. Remember, you can always add more paint. [7] X Research source Plan on using 1 to 2 tablespoons (15 to 30 milliliters) for most jars. For an 8-ounce (240-milliliter) or smaller jar, use 1 to 2 teaspoons instead."

      "title": "Swirl the paint around inside the jar.",
      "content": "Swirl the paint around inside the jar. Tilt the jar around this way and that. Turn the jar on its side, and roll it to help further spread the paint. Keep doing this until you get the paint coverage you want. You can coat the entire inside of the jar, or you can leave bare patches. [8] X Research source If you aren't getting the coverage you want, add another 1 to 2 squirts of paint. If the paint is not moving, it is too thick. Add a few drops of water to the paint, stir it in with a spoon or skewer, and try again."

      "content": "Turn the jar upside down on a stack of paper towels. Cover your work surface or a tray with a waterproof material, such as wax paper. Lay down several sheets of paper towel, then place the jar upside down on it. The excess paint will drip down the sides of the jar and collect on the paper towel. [9] X Research source If you left bare patches, be aware that you will get streaks of paint on the unpainted glass. If you don't want this effect, leave the jar upright."

      "title": "Wait for the excess paint to drain.",
      "content": "Wait for the excess paint to drain. How long this takes depends on how big the jar is, how much paint you used, and how thick the paint was to begin with. This can take as little as a couple minutes to as long as a few hours. [10] X Research source Skip this step if you left bare patches. You'll simply have a thicker coat of paint on the bottom of the jar."

      "title": "Turn the jar right-side-up.",
      "content": "Turn the jar right-side-up. If you want to, you can wipe excess paint from the rim of the jar using a damp cloth. If there is paper towel stuck onto the rim, scrape it off with your fingernail or an emery board, then fill in the bare patches using spare paint and a small paintbrush."

      "content": "Allow the paint to dry. Most acrylic paint takes about 20 minutes to dry, but it could take longer for this project because of how much you used. Keep in mind that some paints sold in the acrylic paint aisle are actually enamel paints. In this case, the paints will need to be cured. Check the label for specific instructions."

      "content": "Add a second color, if desired. You can repeat the process to add a second color to your jar. If you coated the entire jar the first time, the first coat will show through the jar and be visible on the outside, while the second coat will be visible only from the inside. If you coated the jar only partway, the second color will fill in the bare patches, giving you a two-tone effect."

      "content": "Draw designs onto the jar with hot glue before painting it. Clean the jar first, then draw designs onto it using hot glue. Allow the glue to set, then paint over the jar, preferably with spray paint. Allow the paint to dry, then distress and/or seal the jar, if desired. You can draw simple designs, such as dots, swirls, or hearts. You can also write words on the glass instead, such as \"Love\" or \"Witch Brew.\" If you don't have hot glue, you can try using puffy paint instead. The raised designs won't be as prominent and they will take longer to dry."

      "content": "Paint delicate designs by hand using a small paintbrush. Apply just a single coat of acrylic paint; if you apply more than that, the edges of your design may become blurred or uneven. Depending on how thick your coat of paint was, your design could end up looking somewhat translucent, which could lend your jar a delicate appearance. Print out a picture that you like, then tape it inside the jar. Paint your jar using the picture as a guide, then pull the picture out."

Apply 2 to 3 coats of acrylic paint to the inside of the stencil with a pouncer (a round, foam brush). Peel the stencil away, then allow the paint to dry. Seal the jar as desired. If you are using a paintbrush, apply the paint from the outside edges of the stencil inward."

      "content": "Use cut adhesive vinyl to create reverse stencils. Clean your jar first, then cut a shape out of adhesive vinyl or contact paper. Smooth the shape onto the jar taking care to avoid any raised designs. Apply 2 to 3 coats of acrylic paint, allowing each one to dry. Peel the stencil away, then fill in any chips using spare paint and a small paintbrush. [12] X Research source If you wish to seal your jar, do so before you remove the stencil. Avoid painting over the stencil. This will reduce chipping when you go to take it off. Draw the shape by hand or use a cookie cutter to trace it."

Hold the spray can about 12 inches (30 cm) away from the jar, and apply a light coat. Let the paint dry, then apply a second coat if needed. Seal the jar afterwards with clear acrylic sealer in a finish you like: matte, satin, or glossy. In general, it will take 30 minutes for the paint to dry in warm weather, and 60 minutes in cool. Handle spray painted jars with care. The paint may get chipped or scratched easily."

Use a 1 in (2.5 cm) wide paintbrush or foam brush to apply a layer of decoupage glue to the bottom quarter or third of your jar. Stick your hand into the jar, then rotate it as you sprinkle extra-fine glitter onto the glue. Tap the excess glitter off, then allow the jar to dry upside down. Seal the glitter with glossy acrylic sealer, if desired. If you painted the jar by hand, you can wrap tape around it to get a neater line. Peel the tape off before the glue dries. [14] X Research source Do not use tape on jars that have been spray painted. This tends to remove the paint. [15] X Research source"

You can wrap the ribbon around the middle of the jar or around the neck. If you added a stencil or reverse stencil to your jar, then you would definitely want to wrap the ribbon/raffia/cord around the neck so that you don't cover the design up. [16] X Research source"

      "content": "Fill stenciled jars with vase filler if desired. This is great for reverse stencils, but it could look nice with regular ones too. Use enough vase filler so that you can see it peeking through the bottom of your reverse stencil. [17] X Research source If you used a regular stencil, fill the jar as much as you want. Glass marbles make great vase fillers, but you can use colored sand as well. You can find these in the floral section of an arts and crafts store."
