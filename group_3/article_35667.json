      "content": "Apply a chamomile tea compress to the piercing site. Steep a bag of chamomile tea in boiled water for 10 minutes, then dab a clean cotton pad or piece of gauze in the water once it’s cooled. Squeeze out the excess liquid and hold it to your piercing for a few minutes. [1] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Dermatology Professional organization made of over 20,000 certified dermatologists Go to source Use the tea compress up to 3 times per day. If you run out of cotton pads or gauze, try squeezing the water out of the tea bag itself and holding it to your piercing. Chamomile penetrates deeper layers of skin to fight inflammation, kills germs because it’s antimicrobial, and feels soothing on skin.

      "content": "Take over-the-counter anti-inflammatory pain medicine. Use an NSAID (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug) like ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), naproxen (Aleve), or aspirin to treat both pain and inflammation. If the site is just painful and isn’t swollen, try acetaminophen (Tylenol). [3] X Research source Read the instructions of the medication to make sure you’re taking the correct dosage. Make sure you aren't allergic to any ingredients and check with your doctor to see if any painkillers will interact poorly with your existing prescriptions."

      "content": "Consume cold foods and liquids to soothe oral piercings. Try sucking on ice cubes or popsicles, especially within the first 24-48 hours after a lip, tongue, or cheek piercing. Drink lots of ice water and other cold beverages and eat cold foods like ice cream, frozen yogurt, or pieces of frozen fruit. [4] X Research source Avoid warm beverages, hot or spicy foods, tobacco, alcohol, or anything that irritates your mouth. Non-oral piercings shouldn’t swell much, so skip icing them for pain relief. The extra pressure from an ice pack could actually make the piercing swell or hurt more."

      "title": "Keep your piercing in until it’s healed, even if it’s painful.",
      "content": "Keep your piercing in until it’s healed, even if it’s painful. Double check how long your piercer recommends leaving your jewelry in before removing or swapping it out. Leave the piercing in until you heal it fully—removing the piercing can delay the healing process, and putting it back into an unhealed hole can be painful. [5] X Research source Most piercings take 6-8 weeks to heal, but it depends on the exact location and is different for every individual. [6] X Research source Some piercings, like belly button or nipple piercings, can take up to 12 months or more to fully heal."

      "content": "Follow your piercer’s aftercare instructions to a T. Make sure to chat with your piercer about keeping the piercing clean and healthy, and ask for a pamphlet or printout so you can remember the details (reputable piercers should give one to you automatically). If you don’t have specific instructions, clean the piercing twice a day with sterile saline or a piercing aftercare solution . [7] X Research source Don’t use a cotton swab to wipe the piercing, since this could irritate the area and ultimately slow down healing or even lead to scarring."

      "title": "Resist the urge to play with your piercing.",
      "content": "Resist the urge to play with your piercing. Only touch your piercing as necessary to clean it while it heals. Twisting or tugging on your piercing will cause more pain and irritate the piercing site. Germs from dirty hands are also the main cause of infections, so follow the old rule of “look, don’t touch!” [8] X Research source The less you mess with your fresh piercing, the faster it will heal up."

      "content": "Wash your hands before every time you handle or clean the piercing. Scrub your hands with clean, hot water and antibacterial soap for at least 20 seconds. Get all areas of your hands, especially your fingertips and underneath your nails. Touching the piercing with dirty hands is the most common cause of infection. [9] X Research source"

      "title": "Clean the piercing with saline, saltwater, or piercing solution twice a day.",
      "content": "Clean the piercing with saline, saltwater, or piercing solution twice a day. These mixtures keep the area clean without irritation or killing new cells. Avoid chemicals like hydrogen peroxide, iodine, or rubbing alcohol during healing. They’re harsh and will irritate the site, plus they’ll kill any new, healthy cells and delay healing. [10] X Research source Unless there’s an infection, avoid using any ointments. They attempt to heal the skin and might block oxygen from reaching deeper tissue. To do a saltwater soak, submerge the piercing in a small bowl full of saltwater spray or sterile saline solution or hold a dampened cloth to it for 5-6 minutes. [11] X Trustworthy Source Michigan Medicine The University of Michigan's medical center, which provides patient care, supports research, and educates the public on health topics Go to source Make saline with ¼ tsp (1.5 g) of sea salt dissolved in 8 fl oz (240 mL) of boiled water. If the solution is too salty, it will irritate your skin."

      "content": "Keep the piercing as dry as possible. Outside of cleaning the site and showering, do your best to avoid soaking your piercing in any kind of water while it heals (6-8 weeks for most piercings). Avoid swimming in pools, rivers, lakes, or oceans, as well as soaks in a hot tub or a bath. [12] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source Chlorine in pools or contaminants in open water can irritate or infect a fresh piercing.

      "content": "Clean any clothing or bedding that might touch the piercing. If possible, try to keep anything from touching the piercing while it heals, including clothes, hair, your hands, or bedding. This isn’t always practical, so make sure to wear clean clothes, wash your bedding, and try not to sleep on your pierced side since germs from sheets or pillow cases can cause infection. [13] X Research source If you have long hair, pull it back to keep it out of ear, eyebrow, or lip piercings. Talk to your piercer about protecting piercings in places like your navel or nipple. You may have to wear gauze or loose-fitting clothing for several weeks."

      "content": "Stay hydrated, eat a nutritious diet, and get plenty of sleep. A healthy body and immune system heal piercings faster and reduce pain, so make sure to drink plenty of water (and limit your alcohol intake), eat lots of fruits and veggies, and try to get a good night’s sleep every night while your piercing heals. Try taking a multivitamin or adding more vitamin C to your diet, too. [14] X Research source Diet and sleep don’t reduce pain right away like NSAIDs or a chamomile tea compress, but they limit pain in the long run during healing."
