Distribute evenly so everyone has the same amount. Players hold their cards face down and are not allowed to look at them. [1] X Research source It's okay if some players have slightly more or fewer cards than other players. You can also give experienced players fewer cards (since the deck size is equivalent to \"health\")."

      "content": "When a letter card is played, the next person in the sequence must play another letter card in order for play to continue. The number of chances they have to play a letter card is determined by the initial letter; you can play up to 4 cards if an ace has been played, 3 for a king, 2 for a queen, and just 1 for a jack. If the next person in the sequence does not play a letter card within their allotted chances, the person who played the last letter card wins the round and the whole pile goes to them. Subsequently, the next round begins with this winning person. If you play with jokers, in some versions, you have to put down 5 cards for a joker. If you do this, then you can't play the jokers slap (look two steps below). Remember, nobody can look at their cards before they're played, so the odds are completely random!"

      "title": "The only thing that overrides the letter card rule is the slap rule.",
      "content": "The only thing that overrides the letter card rule is the slap rule . The first person to slap the pile of cards when the slap rule is put into effect is the winner of that round. If it cannot be determined who was the first to slap the pile, the person with the most fingers on top wins. If the tie cannot be resolved this way, play continues normally. [3] X Research source Players can also apply the slap rule in these situations: Double : when two cards of equivalent value are laid down consecutively. Ex: 5, 5 Sandwich : when two cards of equivalent value are laid down consecutively, but with one card of different value between them. Ex: 5, 7, 5 Top bottom (or bottoms up): when the same card as the first card of the set is laid down. However, this rule is nullified if a card is burned as a penalty (see below). Tens : when two cards played consecutively (or with a letter card in between) add up to 10. For this rule, an ace counts as one. Ex: 3, 7 or A, K, 9 (sandwich). Also commonly included under this rule is a 10 card of any suit. Jokers : when jokers are used in the game, which should be determined before gameplay begins. Anytime someone lays down a joker, the pile can be slapped. This is only if you're not playing the version where you lay down 5 cards for a joker. Four in a row : when four cards with values in consistent ascending or descending order is placed. Ex: 5, 6, 7, 8 or Q, K, A, 2 Marriage : when a Queen is placed over or under a King (this is considered an optional rule). Ex: Q, K or K,Q"

      "content": "You must add one or two cards to the bottom of the pile if you slap the pile and it was not slap-able. This is called \"burning cards\" and voids the top bottom slap, since it changes the first card in the set. If you have no cards and you slap at the wrong time, then you are out of the game for good (unless you are playing by modified rules, such as allowing players to lend cards to each other)."

In this variation, when three cards of the same type are played in a row (777, QQQ, etc.) the first player to slap instantly wins the game, even if they had no cards before slapping! Note that this is exceedingly rare - for this to happen, the first double has to have gone unnoticed. If anyone slaps the initial double, s/he wins those cards and a triple is no longer possible, even if the next card played is the same type as those in the double."

In this case, when a triple six is played (666), if anyone slaps it, s/he instantly loses, no matter how many cards s/he had. It's extra-tricky to remember to slap any triples except for this one, so be prepared for serious frustration! As with the normal triples described above, this one also requires the initial double to go un-slapped to be valid."
