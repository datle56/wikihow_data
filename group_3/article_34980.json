      "title": "In many Native American cultures, raccoons are seen as tricksters.",
      "content": "In many Native American cultures, raccoons are seen as tricksters. Raccoons are native to the Americas, so it’s no surprise they’re involved in Native American mythology. Specific associations vary from culture to culture, but many Native American cultures portray raccoons as trickster spirits. Stories about raccoons were typically lighthearted and focused on the raccoon’s mischief and cleverness. The raccoons were not usually dangerous or malevolent. [7] X Research source The Abenaki and Penobscot cultures also had a raccoon god named Azeban. Raccoons were also an important part of daily life for many Native cultures, as raccoon motifs have been found in burial sites on weapons, pottery, and tools. The word raccoon comes from the Algonquian word “aroughcoune,” which means “he who scratches with his hands.” Additionally, some Native cultures have raccoon totem animals. A totem is a spirit being, sacred object, or symbol of a certain Native American culture, clan, family, or individual that acts as their main guardian spirit. The raccoon totem often represents duality and the ability to travel between different realms or aspects of life. [8] X Research source"

      "title": "In Norse mythology, raccoons may represent the goddess Fulla.",
      "content": "In Norse mythology, raccoons may represent the goddess Fulla. Fulla is the Norse goddess of abundance, who is also associated with secrecy because she is the goddess Frigg’s handmaiden and confidante. [9] X Research source According to some sources, Fulla may be associated with raccoons. This association is likely because raccoons are sometimes considered secretive or sneaky creatures. However, raccoons were not introduced to Europe until the 1930s, so this is likely a modern association rather than one backed by mythology."
