It could be someone they know personally, a celebrity, or even a fictional character. 🫡 is a small way to pay that person homage over text or on social media apps like Twitter, TikTok, Snapchat, Instagram, and more.

      "content": "A 🫡 emoji can refer to a military salute or support for the troops, too. In the military, soldiers salute as a greeting and a sign of respect and obedience to a superior officer. It can also be used to pay respect to a flag, national anthem, or other patriotic symbol (both in person and online or over text). The 🫡 emoji is sometimes also called “army face,” “soldier greeting,” “patriot emoji,” “army troops,” or “army salute.” [2] X Research source “Proud veteran here 🫡” “Happy Independence Day! 🫡🇺🇸🎆”"

Users might send 🫡 to each other (separately or in group chats) when they’re faced with a common adversity to show that they’re in it together or will support one another during a hard time. This usage made headlines in 2022 when Twitter employees used the 🫡 emoji as a sign off on the office messaging system Slack as they faced massive and chaotic layoffs.

      "content": "The 🫡 emoji is a cheeky way to exaggerate your loyalty to someone. In a more lighthearted and comedic sense, 🫡 is a funny way to say something like “yes, boss” or “you got it, commander” to a friend or colleague who gives you an easy or simple task to do. The emoji exaggerates the importance of the job and makes the sender seem comically submissive to whoever asked for a favor.

Some users say the 🫡 emoji looks like someone blocking the sun from their eyes to look into the distance or to see better in bright sunlight. This usage is uncommon, as the 🫡 emoji is almost always interpreted as a saluting face. [5] X Research source “Just drove through Indiana. Corn as far as the eye can see 🫡🌽” “It’s so sunny, I can’t see anything! ☀️🫡”"

Most platforms show an entire face with a hand in salute, but the Apple version shows only one half of the emoji’s face. To fit the entire face and hand, Apple would’ve had to shrink the dimensions of the face, making it seem small compared to other emoji faces. [7] X Research source To some users, the half-face makes the emoji seem more solemn or resolute."
