You can be discouraged by a daunting pile of tasks, or a feeling that the challenges of your day simply aren't worth motivating yourself for. Think of the big picture. It can be easy to get lost in the day-to-day tasks of life and not realize what you're working toward. Take some time out of each day to remind yourself how the task at hand is contributing to larger goals for your life. These can be financial, fitness, or education goals that will help your career and personal life. Make a list of reasons why you want to accomplish tasks before you."

      "content": "Recognize that you're procrastinating. Sometimes part of procrastinating is filling our day up with so many side tasks that we have difficulty seeing what we are really doing.

      "content": "Schedule your day. Many people are inclined to make to-do-lists. However, these can make your day seem daunting and without being tangibly incorporated into your day are little more than wishful aspirations. You need to consider how much time you have and how long each task will take in order to effectively get moving and avoid a day of laziness. [6] X Research source Make sure you actually account for how long tasks will take you. This reduces the chance you will procrastinate because you are working along a tangible schedule. Also, realize that things may come up that alter your schedule. This is okay. All you need to do is add this to the schedule and adjust your day. Set boundaries. People who are prone to procrastination should avoid blending life/work boundaries. Assuming you will end each work day at 5:30 P.M. forces you to be productive within a certain timespan."

Not all the information that we consume everyday from all kind of media is useful. Unless it's required for you to consume certain information for your work, stop everything else for a week.

It is not important but sooner or later you have to do it. Make it a habit to do it now and you'll stop having an endless list of tasks to do later.
