      "content": "There are many ways to say, “Please Confirm Receipt.” If you feel “Please Confirm Receipt” seems a little too formal or stuffy for more casual emails, there are plenty of options for you to use instead. There are also other alternatives for making a formal request. Here are a few options to try: “Please confirm that you've received this email.” “Please let me know that you got this email.” “Please acknowledge receipt.” “Kindly confirm receipt by return email.” “Please confirm upon receipt.” “Kindly acknowledge receipt of this email.” “Please confirm that you have received this message.” “I would appreciate a quick response to confirm receipt of this email.” “Could you please let me know you've gotten this?” “Looking forward to your confirmation on receiving this email.” “Please acknowledge receipt of this email at your earliest convenience.” “Please verify that you have received this information.” “Can you drop me a note once you get this?” “Please give me a shout when you receive this.” “Just checking in – did you receive my email?” “Just following up to see if you received my message…” “Hey!

      "title": "Include a salutation, the confirmation, and a sign-off.",
      "content": "Include a salutation, the confirmation, and a sign-off. Most of the time, confirming that you’ve received an email requires a simple response that makes up the body of the email. However, it’s good manners to include a greeting and sign-off as well. The salutation and sign-off don’t need to be elaborate. Starting a formal email with a simple “Hello” or “Dear” and the sender’s name is appropriate. Etiquette Coach Tami Claytor advises, “Even though email is casual…you don't just start an email with the content. The salutation and the greeting need to be included. You want to make sure you have a proper closing. ‘Warm regards,’ ‘Best regards,’ or something like that.” If the sender has requested additional information, like a preferred meeting time or an answer to a quick question, be sure to include that information after the confirmation in the body of the email."

      "title": "Send a short reply when confirming that you’ve received the message.",
      "content": "Send a short reply when confirming that you’ve received the message. When someone is asking for confirmation, they aren’t usually asking for a formal reply. A simple response is usually fine. Try one of the following: “I have received the email/document/payment successfully.” “Thank you for the information.” “Acknowledged.” “I got your email. Thanks!” “Thank you for the list of products.” “I got the contract details, and they look good.” “Got it!” However, a very brief reply can seem abrupt to some. If you don’t sign off with a “Thank you,” make sure to add it to the body of the email to make very short replies feel friendlier."
