      "content": "Soak seeds in water a day before planting. This plant loves water, and soaking the seeds ahead of planting will start the germination process. Just place them in a shallow basin with a thin covering of water. [1] X Research source You can find kangkong seeds online or at some gardening stores. You'll need at least 10 seeds to get a small crop of water spinach. Plants grown from seeds may not do as well as plants taken from cuttings. They also take longer to get established.

      "title": "Plant the seeds inside in trays to start.",
      "content": "Plant the seeds inside in trays to start. Place potting soil in your seedling tray. Create a small hole that's about 0.5 in (13 mm) deep. Drop in 1-2 seeds in each hole, and cover the seeds up with potting soil. The tray should be at least 2 to 3 inches (5.1 to 7.6 cm) deep so the plant can start developing roots."

      "content": "Transplant the seedlings when they reach 4 to 6 inches (10 to 15 cm). These plants need a decent amount of growth before you move them outside. Once they reach this height, start checking for leaves. They should have 4 well-established leaves before you move them."

      "title": "Start with cuttings from another plant for a quicker method.",
      "content": "Start with cuttings from another plant for a quicker method. Wait at least a day after harvesting before you take a cutting. Cuttings should be at least 2 to 3 inches (5.1 to 7.6 cm) long. [3] X Research source Place the cuttings in water, stem side down. Leave them in the water, changing it out every day or so. [4] X Research source In a couple of days, they should start growing roots. Wait until day 9 or so before you try to plant them. They should have a well-established root system by then.

      "content": "Wait until nighttime temperatures rise above 50 °F (10 °C). This plant thrives in a temperature of 75 to 85 °F (24 to 29 °C). However, it can be damaged if the temperatures drop below 50 °F (10 °C). Make sure your area has warmed up enough before you move your plants outside. [6] X Research source Definitely wait until several weeks after the last frost before taking these plants outside. Don't plant your kangkong until the nighttime temperature remains well above 50 °F (10 °C)."

      "content": "Dig a small hole with a spade or your hand. The hole should be just big enough to fit the seedling or cutting. You can just use your hand with a gardening glove if the ground is soft enough. If it's not, you'll need to use a small spade to make the hole. [7] X Research source Do not put plants closer than about 6 inches (15 cm) apart."

      "content": "Sow seeds outside if you prefer. Start with rows that are 6 to 8 inches (15 to 20 cm) wide. For every 1 foot (30 cm), plant 6-10 seeds, spreading them out evenly along the row, spacing them out side-to-side as well as lengthwise along the row. Plant the seeds about 0.5 in (1.3 cm) deep, and cover them with soil. Wait until the daytime temperature is consistently over 75 °F (24 °C)."

      "content": "Choose a large pot or basin for your kangkong. Kangkong can grow in a pot of water. You can choose as large a pot as you want. However, keep in mind that you need to be able to reach to the middle of the pot to harvest your plants, so keep it under 4–5 feet (1.2–1.5 m). [9] X Research source You'll also want to be able to inspect your plants for diseases, so make sure the pot is small enough for that purpose."

      "content": "Set a steel mesh into the top of the pot. This mesh will hold the cuttings just under the water. That way, they won't sink to the bottom, but they'll still get plenty of water. [10] X Research source You can find steel mesh online or at home improvement stores. You'll need enough to stretch across your pot, so measure ahead of time. If your mesh is fine enough, you can actually germinate the seeds on top of the mesh. However, if it's not very fine, you'll need to use cuttings."
