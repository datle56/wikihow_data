      "content": "Remove cold ingredients like lettuce and guacamole from your nachos. To make sure your chips come out super crispy, take off all the toppings on your nachos that aren’t cheese, beans, or meat. Set aside these ingredients–you’ll add them back on top of your nachos once they’re reheated. [1] X Research source The best way to store your leftover nachos is to separate the cold and hot ingredients, too. Just put your cold ingredients in an air-tight storage container and your beans and meat in another. If you can, don't cover the chips or the cheese—this can create steam and prevent the chips from getting crunchy again."

If the cheese is melted and the chips are crispy, take them out. If they need more time, give them another 5 minutes, checking them often. [3] X Research source If you want to heat your nachos up quicker, broil them! Just set your broiler on high, about 500 to 550° F (260-287° C), and put your nachos inside for 1 to 3 minutes. Watch them closely, making sure they don’t overcook or burn."

Carefully remove the aluminum foil and plate them once they’ve cooled slightly. Then simply add back on your cold ingredients and enjoy! Leftover nachos keep best for about 2 to 5 days. Just lay a paper towel at the bottom of your air-tight storage container to soak up any moisture and set them in the fridge."

Trying to cook them in a thick layer can cause them to come out soggy instead of crispy."
