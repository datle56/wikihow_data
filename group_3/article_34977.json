      "content": "Fill out the RSVP card that was sent with your wedding invitation. Most wedding invitations include an RSVP card with a structured template. For example, an RSVP card might begin with: \"A favor of reply is requested by July 20, 2014.\" This is the cut-off date for responses. Always RSVP by this date, if not sooner. It is considered rude to leave RSVPs to the last minute. Underneath the deadline there will be an item looking like this: \" M__________. \" Here, you will simply need to fill out your title according to your gender. For example: Mr. Arthur Mitchell or Mrs. Rita Morgan. There will be the option of accepting or declining. Sometimes it is simply an empty space next to \"Will attend,\" where you may place a check mark. Other times, it may look like this: \" __Accepts with pleasure __Declines with regrets. \" In this instance, simply check the appropriate box. You may also leave a brief explanation or a note of congratulations. Once the card is properly filled out, mail it back to the sender. A separate envelope is often included with the RSVP card. If you receive a blank RSVP card, simply mimic the template used in standard RSVP cards. State your name in the third person, whether you will attend, and include the date of the wedding. Remember to use formal wording."

      "content": "Write an RSVP letter to a formal or semi-formal invitation. Invitations to significant events, such as graduations and baby showers, may not specify how to RSVP. In this situation, writing a letter is the proper etiquette. [1] X Research source If you are writing an RSVP letter to a formal invitation, such as a graduation or Bar Mitzvah, keep it simple yet elegant. Write, \"Mr. and Mrs. Dexter Morgan accept with pleasure the kind invitation of Mr. and Mrs. Miguel Prado on Saturday, the first of April.\" [2] X Research source If you are declining an invitation, simply substitute \"accept with pleasure\" with \"regret that we are unable to accept.\" For semi-formal invitations, such as birthdays and baby showers, follow the basic structure of normal letter writing. This letter will be longer than a formal letter but should still be short (only a few sentences). For example: \"Dear Mr. Prado, I regret that I am unable to attend the baby shower you will be hosting for Oscar Prado on December 12, 2014. Unfortunately, I have a work conference scheduled for the same day and it is mandatory that I attend. Though I cannot be present, I have already bought Oscar a gift and will have it delivered to the party.\""

      "content": "Call to RSVP by telephone. Responding by telephone usually involves very casual and small celebrations. However, sometimes formal and semi-formal invitations will request that you RSVP by phone. If you are responding to a formal invitation, remember to maintain respectful etiquette. Though the RSVP may carry over into conversational territory, always use proper English. [7] X Research source Do not use slang or foul language. For example, begin by saying \"Hello, is this Mr. Batista?\" Once he responds, you can reply with, \"Hello Mr. Batista. This is Vince, I'm calling to RSVP to your 50th wedding anniversary party. I can't believe how long you've been married. I look forward to celebrating this momentous occasion with you.\" Be concise. Although the RSVP may include small talk and pleasantries, try not to carry on the conversation longer than it needs to be. Your host has other potential guests to hear from! For casual invitations, especially from friends, using relaxed language will most likely be acceptable. Conversation length will also vary depending on your relationship with that particular person."

Formal invitations sometimes offer the option of bringing a \"plus-1.\" Only bring a date or companion if you have already confirmed that you will do so in the RSVP. Informal invitations may allow some room for multiple guests. Regardless, you should always respond in a timely manner. Avoid bringing unexpected guests or too many guests. Avoid ambiguous estimations, such as \"a few\" or \"a couple.\""

If you have recently suffered an injury or illness, have had a death in the family, or have an unavoidable business conflict, canceling an RSVP is acceptable. Call your host immediately if there are last minute complications. The telephone is the quickest way to reach someone and will save your host unwanted surprises. Never miss an event to which you have already made a commitment without first notifying your host. This conveys both disrespect and indifference towards your host's efforts. Do not cancel because you have something better to do. This is extremely rude and inconsiderate."
