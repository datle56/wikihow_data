      "content": "Tie your hair in a loose bun to prevent frizz. Put some leave-in conditioner in your hair. Then gather your hair into a ponytail on top of your head and twist it loosely. Wrap the twist around itself to create a bun on top of your head. Hold it secure with a soft scrunchie. [1] X Research source Don’t twist or wrap your hair tightly as you put it into a bun, otherwise, this may dent your hair and flatten your curls. This is the best hairstyle to do if you are short on time, yet want to protect your curls as much as possible. [2] X Research source You can also do more than 1 bun if you want more voluminous curls in the morning. For example, divide your hair into 2-4 sections and create a bun for each section."

      "content": "Use the two-strand twist style if you have tight curls or coils. Part your hair down the middle into 2 sections. Divide each section in half again. Take both sections on 1 side of your head, start at the roots, and cross each half over the other until you reach the tips of your hair to form a loose twist shape. Repeat on the other side so you have 1 two-strand twist on each half of your head. Secure each twist with a hair tie wrapped around the end. [3] X Research source You can use this hairstyle if your hair is wet or dry. However, if your hair is damp, you will have tighter curls in the morning. This style creates a two-strand twist on each half of your head. However, you can do as many two-strand twists in your hair as you prefer."
