      "title": "Communicate with others openly and honestly to inspire them to do the same.",
      "content": "Communicate with others openly and honestly to inspire them to do the same. If you’re a leader, tell your employees that you want to create an environment where people can talk freely and honestly, and show this by communicating with them efficiently. If you’re not in charge of others, you can still encourage open communication by talking with others frequently and updating them on the things you’re doing. [1] X Research source If you’re impressed with something your employees did, worried about a deadline, or have questions about a project, talk with others to share your concerns or praise."

      "title": "Give credit to others when they’ve done a good job.",
      "content": "Give credit to others when they’ve done a good job. Congratulate the people around you when they’ve accomplished something so that others are aware of a job well done. This shows that you appreciate the work of others and are a good teammate. [2] X Research source Avoid bragging about your own accomplishments, as this doesn’t show integrity."
    },
    {
      "title": "Treat your employees or coworkers with respect.",
      "content": "Treat your employees or coworkers with respect. Whether you’re talking to your boss or a low-level employee, treat everyone equally and with kindness. Do this by listening to others when they’re speaking without interrupting them, and responding in a polite way to their ideas, opinions, or directions. Being respectful of those around you will encourage others to be respectful to you, too. [3] X Expert Source Guy Reichard Life Coach Expert Interview. 26 April 2021.

      "title": "Respect other people’s opinions even if you don’t agree.",
      "content": "Respect other people’s opinions even if you don’t agree. It’s likely that you’ll run into people whose beliefs, values, or thoughts don’t line up exactly with yours. Instead of convincing yourself that they’re wrong, try to listen to their point of view. Even if you still don’t agree, respect their right to a different opinion and be considerate when you’re talking about it with them. [5] X Expert Source Guy Reichard Life Coach Expert Interview. 26 April 2021.

    {
      "title": "Acknowledge mistakes you made by apologizing and fixing them.",
      "content": "Acknowledge mistakes you made by apologizing and fixing them. If you do or say something that isn’t right, own up to your mistake and acknowledge that you were wrong. This includes apologizing when it’s necessary and making the effort to fix the problem that you may have created or contributed to. [6] X Research source For example, if you accuse someone of something they didn’t do, apologize to make it right. If you forgot to pick up something from the store or didn’t remember an important date, avoid making excuses and accept that you made a mistake."

    {
      "title": "Help others without expecting something in return.",
      "content": "Help others without expecting something in return. This shows kindness as well as integrity.

    {
      "title": "Accept and listen to helpful criticism.",
      "content": "Accept and listen to helpful criticism. It can be hard to accept criticism about ourselves, but being open to others’ advice will only help you become a better person. Take what other people have to say seriously, using it as encouragement to do some self-reflecting. [8] X Research source For example, instead of being angry if someone tells you your listening skills could be improved, think about whether you truly have been a good listener lately and come up with ways to be a better one."
    },
    {
      "title": "Follow through on your commitments to show that you’re reliable.",
      "content": "Follow through on your commitments to show that you’re reliable. Whether you set a date to do something or make a promise to someone, stick to your commitment. This shows that people can depend on you and you take your obligations seriously. If you set a date to meet up with a friend, get there on time so you don’t keep them waiting. If something serious comes up and you can’t follow through on a commitment, be honest about what’s happened and communicate with the other person or people to make it up to them later."

    {
      "title": "Be transparent about things that are happening at work and at home.",
      "content": "Be transparent about things that are happening at work and at home. Be honest about events going on in your life or thoughts you’re having. Tell your family members, friends, or coworkers exactly what’s going on so everyone is on the same page. [9] X Research source For example, if you’re worried about having enough money for something or having enough time to get a project done, be honest about your concerns and share them with the people involved."

      "title": "Use your time productively.",
      "content": "Use your time productively. If you happen to have downtime while you’re at work, try to think of ways to use this time to accomplish things, like responding to emails or helping out a coworker. When you have free time at home, instead of lounging on the couch watching television or wasting time on social media, try organizing the house, reading a book, or spending time on a hobby. Show up to work and try to work productively all the way up until your break or lunchtime, using your downtime to destress and refocus."
