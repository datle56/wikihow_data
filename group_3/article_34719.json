      "content": "Choose the colour of deco mesh. Deco mesh comes in a variety of colours and you can choose one based on your own personal style or match the mesh with the rest of your holiday decor. For instance, you may want to decorate with red, green, gold, silver, or blue deco mesh."

      "title": "Start at the top of the tree.",
      "content": "Start at the top of the tree. When you are making a garland with deco mesh, you should start at the top of the tree and let the remaining roll of deco mesh fall to the ground. You don’t need to cut the mesh until you are finished applying the garland to the tree. [1] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Attach the garland to the tree.",
      "content": "Attach the garland to the tree. Bunch the end of the deco mesh together and attach it to the tree at the top. If you are decorating a real tree, you will need to attach the mesh using twist ties or pipe cleaners. Make sure you attach the mesh deep in the tree so that the twist ties are not visible. [2] X Research source Alternatively, if you are decorating an artificial tree, you can bend the small branches of the tree around the deco mesh to hold it in place."

    {
      "title": "Hang the deco mesh in vertical strips on the tree.",
      "content": "Hang the deco mesh in vertical strips on the tree. After attaching the mesh to the top of the tree, move your hand down the mesh approximately three to five inches (7.5 to 12 cm). Then pinch the mesh together and attach it to the tree again. The mesh should puff out over the branches. Continue this process moving straight down the tree. [3] X Research source Once you reach the bottom cut the mesh and tuck the end into the tree. Repeat the process by creating more vertical garlands on the tree."

    {
      "title": "Wrap the deco mesh around the tree, alternatively.",
      "content": "Wrap the deco mesh around the tree, alternatively. You can also make a deco mesh garland that continuously wraps around the tree. Once you have attached the garland at the top of the tree, begin wrapping it around the tree. Periodically you can gather the mesh together and attach it deep in the tree. This will create large puffs of deco mesh around the tree. [4] X Research source When you reach the bottom of the tree, cut the mesh and hide the end by tucking it into the tree."
    },
    {
      "title": "Place the garland on the branches.",
      "content": "Place the garland on the branches. When you are arranging your deco mesh garland on the tree, it is important that you push some of the garland back into the tree. For example, when you attach the garland to the tree, make sure this is done deep in the branches. This way it won’t look like you just threw the deco mesh onto the tree. You can also lay the garland along the branches when you are wrapping it around the tree."

    {
      "title": "Cut the deco mesh into smaller pieces.",
      "content": "Cut the deco mesh into smaller pieces. You can scatter smaller pieces of deco mesh throughout your tree to add colour and texture. Begin by cutting the deco mesh into pieces. The size of your pieces can vary, but they should be approximately two to three inches (5 to 7.5 cm) in length. [5] X Research source The number of pieces you need will vary depending on the size of your tree and how much deco mesh you would like."

      "title": "Roll the pieces into tubes and attach them to the tree.",
      "content": "Roll the pieces into tubes and attach them to the tree. One way is to roll the cut pieces into tubes and then attach the centre of the tube to the tree. Place the centre of the tube deep in the tree and attach it to a branch. The two sides of the tube will stick out creating a whimsical look. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Drape the pieces over the branches. You can also keep the pieces of deco mesh flat and push one corner back into the tree and let the rest of the mesh drape over the branches like a small piece of garland. [7] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Scatter the pieces throughout the tree.",
      "content": "Scatter the pieces throughout the tree. Don’t worry about creating a uniform look throughout the tree. Instead, you want it to be natural looking and not too symmetrical. [8] X Research source The great thing about this method is that it doesn’t use as much deco mesh as creating a garland, but you can still get a fun look."

    {
      "title": "Try using more than one colour of deco mesh.",
      "content": "Try using more than one colour of deco mesh. When you are decorating with deco mesh, you can get creative and try using multiple different colours of mesh. For example, you may want to use red and green mesh throughout your tree to give it more variety. Alternatively, you could pair red and gold or blue and silver. Choose a look that matches with the rest of your decorations. You can also try layering the colours by using different sizes of deco mesh."
