Get safety goggles that completely cover your eyes and are tight to your skin so the spores don’t cause eye irritation. Since the spores can damage your respiratory system, fit an N-95 respirator over your mouth and nose and make sure it sits tightly against your skin. Finally, wear some rubber gloves so you don’t get any mold on your skin. [1] X Research source Protective gear also helps protect you from fumes created by the cleaning supplies you use."

However, it’s also possible to make your own mold-cleaning solution with household ingredients, such as common cleaners or natural products. [2] X Research source Here are a few ways you can make your own cleaning solution: Undiluted white vinegar : Use undiluted white vinegar by itself for a natural solution. This is best used for hard surfaces in kitchens and bathrooms. Apply it directly to the mold and let it sit for an hour before wiping it away with a cloth. Bleach: For something stronger, mix one cup of bleach in a gallon of water. Apply it to the surface, and don’t rinse it off. Ammonia: Mix a 50/50 solution of ammonia and water and spray it on the surface. Let it sit for 2-3 hours, then rinse and repeat if necessary. Hydrogen peroxide: Apply 3% hydrogen peroxide to hard surfaces and let it sit for 10 minutes. Then, scrub it off with a cloth or brush and wipe the surface clean with a dry rag. Repeat as necessary. Baking soda solution : Mix 2 parts baking soda, 1 part white vinegar, and 1 part water in a spray bottle. Apply it directly to the mold and let it sit for 10 minutes before scrubbing with a brush or cloth. Warning: Never mix ammonia with bleach or other all-purpose cleaners, as this will create toxic fumes.

Other types of mold typically look slimy or fuzzy and can be different colors, like green, red, blue, or black. These molds penetrate deeper into materials and can be more dangerous, as exposure can lead to headaches, skin irritation, and respiratory issues if left untreated.
