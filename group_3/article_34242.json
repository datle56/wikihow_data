      "title": "Make your pie using cold ingredients.",
      "content": "Make your pie using cold ingredients. Preparing your pie with cold ingredients and then putting the chilled pie into a hot oven will help prevent mushiness. Everything should be cold, including your ingredients, bowls, and materials. You can chill your pie in the refrigerator, as well. To chill your pie in the refrigerator, place the assembled pie inside the refrigerator for about fifteen minutes. Preheat your oven to the baking temperature. Put the cold pie into the hot oven.

      "title": "Choose tart apples.",
      "content": "Choose tart apples. When you cook apples, the pectin in them breaks down, making the apples watery. The lower pH value of tart apples reduces the amount of pectin that breaks down, so the apples hold their shape and get less mushy. This will prevent your pie from getting watery. Your best apple choices are Granny Smith, Gala, and Golden Delicious. [2] X Research source Use firm apples and avoid overripe fruit. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Add a thin sprinkling of flour on top of your bottom crust.",
      "content": "Add a thin sprinkling of flour on top of your bottom crust. A light layer of flour will soak up excess liquid in your filling without changing the flavor of your pie. Sprinkle the flour over the pie crust before you add your pie filling. You can also use ground nuts, though you might be able to taste them in the pie. [4] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Cut vents into your crust.",
      "content": "Cut vents into your crust. You need to cut five ¾”-inch (2 centimeter) vents in your top pie crust to allow the evaporating liquid to escape. This will prevent the pie from becoming soggy. Vents are usually placed near the center of the pie. Many people enjoy making five vents in a star pattern like the seeds inside an apple. Your vents will also help you tell if the pie is ready. The pie filling will start to bubble up out of the vents when it is nearly done. A lattice style pie does not need vents as long as there are gaps in the lattice. You also do not need to cut vents into a Dutch apple pie, which will be topped with a crumbly topping."

      "title": "Allow your pie to bake for the entire recommended period.",
      "content": "Allow your pie to bake for the entire recommended period. Your pie may start to brown early, making it look ready. People often pull their pie too soon out of fear that it will burn. This leads to runny pie because it prevents the filling from thickening. Check the recommended cooking time, and set a timer. Don’t use the brownness of your pie crust to judge if it is done. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Use aluminum foil to prevent over-browning the crust.",
      "content": "Use aluminum foil to prevent over-browning the crust. If you're worried your crust will over-brown, cover the crust with foil halfway through baking. To do this, measure your foil before you put the pie in the oven. Pull off a piece big enough to cover the whole pie, then cut out the center so that only the crust will be covered. Halfway through your baking time, carefully place the foil onto the pie, covering the crust. You can also place strips of foil around the edge of the pie crust, but it's safer to use one big piece since you could burn yourself on the hot pie. [6] X Research source If your oven has a tendency to cook pies unevenly, then you may want to apply foil strips to just the part of the crust that is already brown, leaving the rest to continue browning."

      "content": "Drain away the natural juices. Use a colander to strain all of the liquid from the bowl. You can use this liquid in another recipe if you’d like, or you can try to thicken it by cooking it on the stove. If you decide to thicken it, heat it over low heat until the extra moisture evaporates, leaving a thicker sauce. You can add this sauce to your pie if you’d like, though you may want to add a thickener if you do. Cook the sauce until it reaches your desired consistency or it reaches the thickness of syrup.

      "content": "Bulk up your apple mixture with thickener. A thickener prevents the filling from being too watery by adding a substance that will absorb some of the liquid that seeps out of the fruit. A small amount of thickener should not alter the flavor of your pie."
