You can use nail files or emery boards, or even skin exfoliators such as loofahs. In addition, simple table salt can work as an exfoliant. Wet the area with water and rub the salt into the super glue until it forms a paste. This can help loosen the glue and lift it from your skin. Be as gentle with these products as possible, as they are likely to irritate your skin from repeated rubbing."
