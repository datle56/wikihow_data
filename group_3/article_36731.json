      "content": "Make your eye water. When there is a speck in your eye, the best and most natural way to get a speck out of it is to make your eye water. It might do this on its own since it is irritated, but if it doesn't, try blinking rapidly and frequently to make your eye water. Your natural tears will help flush out your eye and may pull out the speck.

Hold you eye open wide and have them look for the speck as you look around. Make sure you look up, down, and side to side so they can see all the areas of your eye. If you can't find it at first, you may need to pull down your lower lid and check under there. You can also hold open your top lid and check there are well. The speck might get stuck on the back of your lids. If you are by yourself, grab a mirror. Hold your eye open and move it around and look for the speck as best you can."

Wet the end of the cotton swab with water. Hold your eyelid open with one hand and gently remove the speck with the tip of the cotton swab. You can also use a clean washcloth or a soft, damp towel if you don't have a cotton swab. If the particulate is on the cornea (the non-white portion of your eye), do not use a cotton swab to get it out. The cornea is very sensitive and you may damage it.

You can also cover it with a towel or soft cloth if you get an appointment immediately after your cleansing methods fail.
