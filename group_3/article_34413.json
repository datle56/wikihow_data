      "content": "Take your cutting in the spring or fall. You can cut roses any time of year, and opinions vary on the best time to do it. However, you may have the best success of rooting your rose cuttings if you take them when the weather is mild—usually in the spring or fall. [1] X Research source Wait until your rose is finished blooming—if the plant is putting energy into producing flowers, it may not root easily. Water your rose bush the day before you take the cutting to ensure the stems will be well-hydrated. If you can, take your cutting first thing in the morning before the sun starts to dry out the rose bush. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Fill a 4 in (10 cm) planter with a mixture of potting soil and perlite. Mix a 50-50 blend of potting soil and perlite or vermiculite . Pack about 1 in (2.5 cm) of soil firmly into the bottom of your planter , then loosely fill the rest of the planter all the way to the top. [3] X Research source Using perlite or vermiculite will help improve the drainage of your soil—too much moisture can cause your rose to rot before it takes root. Be sure to use a planter with drainage holes so water doesn’t pool in the bottom."

      "title": "Select a green stem that’s about the width of a pencil.",
      "content": "Select a green stem that’s about the width of a pencil. Choose a healthy and established plant to take a cutting from. The stem should come from the top or side of the plant, and it should have at least three leaves on it. Ideally, find a stem that has flowered recently. Look for a stem that’s young but established and hardy, and that’s about 4–6 in (10–15 cm) [4] X Research source It’s better to take cuttings from the top and side of the plant because they seem to root better than cuttings from the middle or bottom. It’s OK if the stem you select has buds and flowers currently on it, but look for a stem with flowers that are starting to wither. This indicates the stem recently bloomed."

      "title": "Make a 45° cut at the bottom of the stem.",
      "content": "Make a 45° cut at the bottom of the stem. Plant specialist Monique Capanelli recommends using sharp, clean pruning shears to cut the stem from the plant at a 45-degree angle, just below one of the lower leaf nodes (where the leaf attaches to the stem). [5] X Expert Source Monique Capanelli Plant Specialist Expert Interview. 22 September 2020. Make sure the cutting tool has been sterilized to prevent the spread of disease. To sterilize your cutting tool, wipe it down with 70% rubbing alcohol before you make a cut."

      "content": "Keep your cuttings moist and cool. If you’re not going to plant your cuttings right away, place them in a bucket or cooler to keep them out of direct sunlight. If it’s really hot out, you might even want to put ice in the cooler. [6] X Research source If the cuttings dry out in the sun, they may not root."

    {
      "title": "Remove flowers, buds, and some leaves.",
      "content": "Remove flowers, buds, and some leaves. With the same pruning shears, cut off any withered flowers and new buds where they attach to the stem. If any hips (fruit) have started to form, cut these off as well. [7] X Research source Cut off any leaves on the lower half of the stem. Leave two to three higher leaves to help with photosynthesis. Cut these leaves in half to reduce the loss of moisture."
    },
    {
      "title": "Wound the cutting.",
      "content": "Wound the cutting. Wounding is the process of making slits in the bottom of the stem, and this will encourage rooting. With the same cutting tool, cut two 1 in (2.5 cm) slits in the bark at the bottom of the stem. [8] X Research source Make three or four slits in the bark to give the roots more places to grow out from."

      "content": "Dip the cutting in rooting hormone. Capanelli recommends using rooting hormone on any cutting that you’re trying to propagate. [9] X Expert Source Monique Capanelli Plant Specialist Expert Interview. 22 September 2020. Insert the bottom 2 in (5.1 cm) of the cutting into the powder so that the cutting, wounds, and bottom of the stem are covered in the hormone. Shake it gently to remove excess hormone. Rooting hormone is not a necessary step in the cutting and propagating process, but it will increase the chances that your cutting will grow successfully."

      "title": "Plant and water the cutting.",
      "content": "Plant and water the cutting. With the tip of your finger or a pencil, make a 2 in (5.1 cm) hole in the potting soil at the center of the pot. Place the cut end of the stem in the hole. Pack the soil around the stem and use your hands to firm the soil in place. Water the soil so that it’s thoroughly moist."

    {
      "title": "Cover the cutting with plastic or a mason jar.",
      "content": "Cover the cutting with plastic or a mason jar. To cover the stem with plastic, insert two sticks or wires into the soil on either side of the stem. Cover the pot and stem with a clear plastic bag, and affix the bag to the pot with an elastic or twine. With a mason jar, simply place a large mason jar over the stem. [10] X Research source Covering the stem with glass or plastic will create a miniature greenhouse, and the cover will help keep in the heat, moisture, and ultraviolet rays the stem needs to root and grow."

    {
      "title": "Provide the cutting with plenty of sunlight and moisture as it grows.",
      "content": "Provide the cutting with plenty of sunlight and moisture as it grows. Throughout each day, the plant will need plenty of bright sunlight. But to avoid overheating, place the plant in a bright location that receives lots of indirect sunlight, especially around midday. [11] X Research source The mason jar or plastic will help to keep the soil and cutting moist, but add more water any time the cutting or soil starts to dry out. Placing a heating mat under the plant can help encourage the roots to grow. How does it take a cutting to root? A rose cutting will root in 2-4 weeks, but this varies based on the type of flower and its environment. Know that the flower may not bloom for 2-3 years."

      "title": "Find a healthy branch low to the ground.",
      "content": "Find a healthy branch low to the ground. Layering is a simple technique for propagating an existing rose bush. Check the lower branches of the bush, and select one that’s healthy and strong, with fresh growth at the end of the branch. [12] X Research source New growth indicates the branch is in good health and will continue growing after layering. It may be best to layer the rose bush in spring so it will have plenty of time to root."

      "title": "Scrape some of the bark off the branch where it meets the ground.",
      "content": "Scrape some of the bark off the branch where it meets the ground. Bend the branch down to the ground and notice where it touches the soil. Use a sharp knife or garden spade to carefully scrape away some of the bark, but don’t cut into the wood. [13] X Research source Scraping the bark will encourage the rose bush to root at that spot. To increase the chances of rooting, sprinkle rooting hormone over the spot that you scraped."

      "title": "Bury the cut spot on the branch 1–3 in (2.5–7.6 cm) underground.",
      "content": "Bury the cut spot on the branch 1–3 in (2.5–7.6 cm) underground. Dig a small hole where the branch meets the ground—no more than 3 in (7.6 cm) deep or wide. Place the branch in this hole, then firmly pack the dirt back into the hole on top of the branch. [14] X Research source If you need to, place a stone or other weight on top of the hole so the branch doesn’t spring up out of the ground. Leave the remainder of the branch out of the ground—only the part that you wounded should be in the soil."

      "title": "Wait about a year before dividing the plant.",
      "content": "Wait about a year before dividing the plant. The section of the branch that you buried should root, effectively turning the branch into a healthy new plant. Wait until the following spring, then cut the branch away from the parent plant. [15] X Research source If you’d like, you can dig up the new rose bush at this time and plant it wherever you’d like."

      "title": "Divide your rose in the early spring or late fall.",
      "content": "Divide your rose in the early spring or late fall. During this time, your rose bush will be in a dormant state. Dividing it at this time will minimize shock to the plant and improve root growth. [16] X Research source Avoid dividing rose bushes when they're in bloom. Dividing roses is less popular than propagating by cuttings because it’s more difficult and time consuming. However, it can be a good option if you have an overgrown rose bush that you’d like to separate into two plants."

      "content": "Plant them in a location that gets 6–8 hours of light a day. Roses grow best when they’re planted in an area with plenty of bright light. [20] X Research source However, if you’re in a very warm climate, it may be best to choose a location that gets indirect sunlight at mid-day when the sun is at its hottest. In cooler climates, plant the roses in front of a south-facing or west-facing wall or fence to give the roses some extra protection and reflected heat."

      "content": "Water the roses twice a week in summer. Roses need to be watered deeply, especially during their first year and during the warmer summer months. Provide deep soakings twice a week in summer to keep the soil consistently moist. [21] X Research source The best way to water roses is with a drip irrigation system or soaker hose that concentrates water at the base and roots of the plant. If the flowers or foliage get wet, it could cause disease, fungus, and rot problems."

      "title": "Prune your rose bush in the spring and remove dead flowers as needed.",
      "content": "Prune your rose bush in the spring and remove dead flowers as needed. Roses will thrive when they are pruned regularly, as pruning removes diseased stems, flowers, and leaves, and increases circulation throughout the plant. In the spring, use shears or loppers to remove dead flowers, diseased stems, and old leaves. [23] X Research source Throughout the spring and summer, continue removing dead flowers and leaves as necessary."
