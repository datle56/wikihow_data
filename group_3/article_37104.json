      "content": "Move the key out of the way if it is inside the fob. Some key fobs hold the key inside the fob to store it when you’re not using it. If you have this style of fob, move the key out of the way to access the battery. On most fobs, you either slide the key out or press a button to swing it to the top of the fob. [1] X Research source Cars like Fords, Chevys, Dodges, and Hondas typically have key fobs with a removable key. To remove it, just hold the button on the side of the fob or push the switch on the back. Then, pull up on the silver top of the fob. [2] X Research source Cars like Volkswagens typically have a key that swings out of the fob. Simply press the button on the front of the fob to extend the key to the top of the fob.

      "content": "Unscrew the back of the key fob if your fob has a screw. Some older car models, like the Honda Accord, have a screw that holds the back half of the fob to the front. Just flip your key fob over and look for a tiny screw in the plastic. If you have a screw, use a small Phillips head screwdriver to rotate the screw counterclockwise and remove it. Work slowly to avoid stripping the screw. [4] X Research source Set the screw aside in a safe spot so you don’t lose it, like inside a resealable bag or small cup."

      "content": "Twist a coin or screwdriver into the notch along the seam if your fob has one. Most key fobs have a small indentation or slot along the side seam of the fob that separates the top and bottom halves. The notch might be on the top or bottom of the fob, or on either side. Simply take a small flathead screwdriver or coin and push it into the indentation. Then, turn and twist your tool up to separate the top half of the fob from the bottom. [5] X Research source Work your way around the seam, continuing to turn and twist the coin or screwdriver to fully remove the fob’s halves. On fobs with a removable key, look for the slot in the cavity where the key was. Then, insert the key into the notch to pry the halves apart. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Push a screwdriver into the seam if your fob doesn’t have a notch. Some key fobs might not have a slot along the seam. If you have this type of fob, simply push the tip of a flathead screwdriver or butter knife into any point on the seam. Then, lift the screwdriver to separate the halves. Continue to insert the screwdriver and lift up at different points along the seam to fully separate the halves. [7] X Research source"

      "title": "Lift the old battery out with a screwdriver.",
      "content": "Lift the old battery out with a screwdriver. Most key fob batteries look like a small, silver coin and are usually located in the center of the fob. Just slip the tip of a small flathead screwdriver or butter knife under the battery. Then, gently lift up with your screwdriver to take it out of the fob. [8] X Research source Some fobs have clips over the battery, so lift the clips up with a screwdriver. Move slowly, lifting the clips as gently as possible to avoid breaking them. Recycle your old batteries by searching for a battery collection site near you online."

      "title": "Slide the new battery into place in the same position as the old one.",
      "content": "Slide the new battery into place in the same position as the old one. Check the back of the fob’s cover or under the battery compartment to see whether the positive or negative side of the battery faces up. Then, slide the battery into the slot and push it down to secure it into place. [9] X Research source If you’re not sure which way to insert the battery, look it up in your car’s owner’s manual. Check your car’s owner manual or the backside of your fob to see what type of battery you need. Most car key fobs use CR2025 or CR2032 batteries, though others, like the Honda CR-V, use a CR1620 . [10] X Research source General stores, home improvement stores, and auto parts stores usually sell coin-style batteries. They typically come in packs of 2 to 6 and cost $5-10. Most key fobs only take 1 battery, though some, like the Ford Mustang’s key fob, take 2."

      "content": "Press the 2 halves of the fob back together. Put the cover back on the fob to cover up the battery. Then, simply push down to snap it back into place. If the back half of your fob was attached with a screw, use a screwdriver to turn it clockwise and bind the halves together. [11] X Research source"

      "title": "Test the key fob to make sure it works.",
      "content": "Test the key fob to make sure it works. Point the key fob at your car or other device and click one of the buttons. If your fob still isn’t working, you might’ve put the battery in the wrong direction. Just take the fob apart again, flip over the battery, and test the fob again. [12] X Research source Most key fobs work without you having to reprogram them after replacing the battery. If your fob still isn’t working after ensuring the battery is in correctly, it might be broken. Call a locksmith or your local car dealership to replace the fob . Or, if you have an older car, buy a blank replacement key fob online. Then, program the fob to your car."
