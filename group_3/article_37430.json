They’ve trusted you with their identity, and nothing you say will change who they are inside. [7] X Research source If you don’t think you can be friends with them anymore, be honest but refrain from judgment and criticism. Consider taking a step back and questioning your own beliefs.

When someone comes out, they’re looking for support, validation, and acceptance; they don’t want their news negatively affecting their relationships. Rather than putting on an act, just be yourself! If you and your friend are jokesters, ease their worries with a casual inside joke. If you and your friend enjoy serious conversations, ask them to tell you more about their identity as long as they’re comfortable. Focus on your friend’s needs in the situation, letting them laugh, cry, or be quiet. [9] X Expert Source Lauren Urban, LCSW Licensed Psychotherapist Expert Interview. 3 September 2018."

As you talk to your friend, it’s normal to relate the situation to things you’re familiar with; however, your friend’s situation may not be the same as someone else’s.
