Trending are popular modes that have been voted by users who have already played a specific custom mode. You can also start a lobby based on that mode.

In this section, you can select the mode/map of the mode (Classic, Necrokeep/Brawl, Minoan Labyrinth/Survival, and Chess-TD), determine the number of teams on one side and the winning condition. Destroy Base means the game will end if players manage to destroy the base turret. Takedowns require a specific number (maximum 50) of kills before the game ends. The game can also end if the base turret is destroyed."

      "content": "Choose the selection of heroes and battle spells. In this section, you have the choice of being selective to a certain hero, changing battle spells, and determining if you want to allow emblems to enhance the hero. Hero Selection can either be similar to a classic mode (one different hero per player) or Mirror Mode (the team votes on what hero to select). Heroes can include all heroes, owned heroes per player, or specific heroes. Battle Spells can be adjusted to include a select number of spells, owned spells, or change the addition of two battle spells. You can also adjust the default battle spell from Regen to something else. Switch Hero is what enables Deathbattle mode. The minimum of heroes that can be swapped is 6, with the maximum at 12."

Minions can be adjusted to Mid Lane only, all three lanes, or without minions at all (plus with minion size). This can be adjusted for Necrokeep/Classic maps. Minimap Avatar can either be the default (you only see allies avatar and enemies avatar when detected nearby), hide (where all avatars are hidden), or show all (all avatars will be shown regardless)."

Damage Dealt is the amount of damage given per skill/basic attack, with 500 percent as the maximum. Damage Taken is the amount of damage earned when hit with a basic attack/skill, with 1000 percent as the maximum. Cooldown and Battle Spell Cooldown is the time needed before the hero can reuse their basic attack, battle spell, or skill. Putting it into maximum is recommended for Overdrive/quick modes, although this can depend. If the stats are for the same team, you can toggle Edit Both Teams."
