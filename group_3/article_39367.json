      "title": "Stand behind the free throw line.",
      "content": "Stand behind the free throw line. The free throw line is the straight line in front of the hoop that’s parallel to the short side of the court. In a basketball game, you can get fouled if you cross the free throw line at any point during your shot. When you set up for your free throw, step up to the line without going over it. [1] X Research source It’s okay if your toes are at the edge of the line when you set up your shot."

    {
      "title": "Place your shooting foot in line with the center of the rim.",
      "content": "Place your shooting foot in line with the center of the rim. Your shooting foot is on the same side of your body as your dominant hand. Look at the middle of the basketball rim and do your best to align your foot with it. Keep your toes pointed toward the basket to help keep your shot straight. [2] X Research source If you stand with the middle of your body lined up with the rim, then you’ll have to angle your shooting arm and you’re more likely to miss."
    },
    {
      "title": "Angle your body so your dominant side is closer to the hoop.",
      "content": "Angle your body so your dominant side is closer to the hoop. While you can stand with your body square to the hoop, it can put a lot of tension in your shoulders. Keep your shooting foot and your dominant side closer to the line. Stagger your feet so your hips and shoulders are slightly angled to the basket. The angle of your body depends on what feels comfortable, so try out different angles to see what works best for you. [3] X Research source Avoid turning your body so much that you strain when you look at the hoop. You should feel loose and relaxed when you’re making a free throw."

    {
      "title": "Bend your knees and shift your weight to your toes.",
      "content": "Bend your knees and shift your weight to your toes. Squat down slightly so your legs make about a 45-degree angle. Make sure the knee on your dominant side lines up with the center of the basket. Rather than keeping your weight in your heels, lean forward slightly so you’re balancing on your toes. That way, you’ll be able to push your body up so you can shoot the ball farther. Most of your power comes from your legs during a free throw."
    },
    {
      "title": "Line up your shooting arm and shoulder with the middle of the hoop.",
      "content": "Line up your shooting arm and shoulder with the middle of the hoop. If you have your arm turned away from the basket, it’s more difficult to line up your free throw. Extend your arm out in front of you and turn your upper body if your hand and elbow don’t line up with the basket. Once you’re in position, avoid turning or readjusting your stance. [4] X Research source As you get more used to shooting free throws, you won’t have to extend your arm out to line up your shot."

    {
      "title": "Dribble or spin the ball a few times to develop a shooting routine.",
      "content": "Dribble or spin the ball a few times to develop a shooting routine. Most basketball players use a consistent routine when setting up a free throw so they get in a familiar mindset every time they shoot. You may dribble the ball 2–3 times or spin it in your hands. Whatever routine you choose, keep it the same every time you make a free throw to help you feel more in the zone and eliminate distractions. [5] X Research source Avoid switching up your routine before you shoot the ball since you won’t have any consistency between your shots."

    {
      "title": "Hold onto the ball with your dominant hand.",
      "content": "Hold onto the ball with your dominant hand. Position the basketball so the seams are horizontal. Spread out your fingers on your dominant hand and grab onto the ball. Point your fingers the direction of the hoop, or else you’ll shoot the ball at an angle. Make sure to keep your wrist square so it doesn’t twist around. [6] X Research source Avoid pressing your palm against the ball since you won’t have as much control when you’re shooting."
    },
    {
      "title": "Bend your shooting arm and wrist back to make a C-shape.",
      "content": "Bend your shooting arm and wrist back to make a C-shape. Extend your dominant shooting arm in front of you so your palm is face-down. Bend your elbow at a 90-degree angle so your hand points up. Then, tilt your wrist backward so it’s near parallel with your upper arm. The ball should be about the same height as your head. [7] X Research source Your arm position will feel more natural as you practice shooting free throws. Avoid bending your elbow any further back since it will be easier to misalign your shot or use too much power."

    {
      "title": "Steady the side of the basketball with your non-dominant hand.",
      "content": "Steady the side of the basketball with your non-dominant hand. Position your non-dominant hand so your fingers point straight up. Place your hand on the side of the basketball so you’re barely touching it. As you shoot, you won’t use your non-dominant hand to push the ball forward, but it will help keep your shot straight. You’re now in full position to make your free throw. [8] X Research source Be careful not to wrap your fingers around the front or back of the ball, or else you’ll shoot it at an angle."

      "title": "Focus on the basket rather than the ball.",
      "content": "Focus on the basket rather than the ball. Look at the center of the rim and don’t look away once you find it. Visualize the ball going into the basket so you’re more confident as you shoot your free throw. Avoid looking at the ball, other players, or the crowd when you’re making your shot. [9] X Research source Don't overthink it! The more your mind takes over, the less chance you have of making the free throw.

      "title": "Breathe slowly to help you focus.",
      "content": "Breathe slowly to help you focus. It’s okay to feel nervous or under pressure when you make a free throw. Once you’re in the ready free throw position, take a deep breath through your nose and exhale through your mouth. Keep your focus on the rim and where you want the ball to go. Take a few more breaths so you’re relaxed and ready. [11] X Research source It may help to do a quick routine before shooting the ball. [12] X Expert Source Taylor Rochestie Professional Basketball Player Expert Interview. 13 July 2021. For example, before every free throw, you may take 3 deep breaths and then shoot the ball as you’re exhaling. Make sure you catch your breath and feel steady on your feet before taking the shot.

      "title": "Straighten your shooting arm and legs to shoot the ball.",
      "content": "Straighten your shooting arm and legs to shoot the ball. In one fluid motion, push down with your toes and straighten your knees until they’re fully extended. At the same time, lift your elbow up to straighten your shooting arm. Your arm should be extended by the time your legs straight are straight. [14] X Research source While most players don’t jump while making a free throw, it’s okay if you do. Just be sure not to cross the free throw line. Avoid straightening your legs and then extending your arm since you won’t get as much power and the ball may not reach the basket. It may take a few tries to get the hang of the shooting motion. Don’t get discouraged if you miss your first few free throws. Keep practicing until it feels natural. This way, you can feel more confident during a future game.

      "content": "Snap your wrist to follow through with your shot. Right as you fully extend your arm, quickly bend your wrist forward to help propel the ball toward the basket. Hold your follow-through position while the ball is in the air and wait for it to land before relaxing again. [16] X Research source Be careful not to twist your wrist as you snap it forward, or else the ball may angle away from the hoop."
