      "content": "Preheat the oven and gather your kitchen instruments. Shrinking a chip bag requires a few simple kitchen items, including two baking trays, two sheets of parchment paper, and oven mitts. Gather these items while preheating the oven to 200 degrees Fahrenheit."

      "title": "Empty and wash the chip bag you wish to shrink.",
      "content": "Empty and wash the chip bag you wish to shrink. Get all of the crumbs and other food particles out of the bag. Leaving them in will cause bumps and irregularities in the bag after it shrinks. Dry the bag with a paper towel to help remove leftover particles."

      "title": "Place the chip bag on the baking tray.",
      "content": "Place the chip bag on the baking tray. Lay the chip bag between two sheets of parchment paper. If you want your chip bag to have a flatter, smoother look, place the second baking tray on top of the parchment paper, sandwiching the bag between the trays. For a wrinkled look, leave off the second tray."

      "title": "Cook the bag for ten minutes.",
      "content": "Cook the bag for ten minutes. Place the tray in the preheated oven and allow to bake for 10 minutes. Check the bag every 2 minutes to gauge its progress and make sure the bag is not being damaged. After the ten minutes are complete, remove the tray and peel the parchment paper apart to reveal your tiny chip bag. Take care when removing the tray and handling the bag. Both will be hot after their baking period. The bags will be small and hard, and generally difficult to shape. The bags become easier to bend if they aren't fully shrunk. A bag will shrink down to approximately 25% percent of its original size depending on whether you cook it for the fully suggested time, or a lower time."

Leaving them in will cause bumps and irregularities in the bag after it shrinks. Dry the bag with a paper towel to help remove leftover particles. Note that the aluminum lining the inside of most chip bags will cause sparks in the microwave. If you choose to use the microwave to shrink the bag, watch the bag very carefully."

      "title": "Place the bag in the microwave for 5 seconds.",
      "content": "Place the bag in the microwave for 5 seconds. Set the microwave setting to “high” and allow the bag to cook for no more than 5 seconds. Keep your eyes on the bag at all times. The bag will likely spark, but should not ignite provided it does not \"cook\" for more than a few seconds. If the bag ignites into flames, turn off the microwave!"

      "title": "Allow the bags to cool.",
      "content": "Allow the bags to cool. The chip bags will be very hot to the touch. Leave them in the microwave for 3 to 5 minutes before handling them. You may also use oven gloves or tongs to remove the bag if you wish to cool them elsewhere. Don't try shrinking multiple bags at a time in the microwave. This will increase the amount of time required to shrink each bag, which can lead to a greater risk of the bags igniting into flame.

      "content": "Punch a hole in the corner to make a keychain. Use a paper hole puncher to create a small hole in the corner of the bag. Carefully thread a keychain loop through the hole to make a colorful and stylish accessory for your key chain. Staple the top of the bag shut if you’re concerned the bag will rip while in your pocket. This also provides some additional heft to the bag. Scissors or an awl can also be used to create a hole for the keychain loop if you don't have a hole puncher handy."

They make a great addition to the decorative buttons and pins that are common on backpacks. Lapel pins and studs can also be used to secure the bag to your backpack. Check your local jeweler for information on the types of backs you can use."

      "content": "Place them in collages or scrapbooks. Use a bit of glue to paste the bags into your scrapbook. Opt for making the bags a bit flatter (using the second baking tray) so that they better fit in the book. You can also cut and modify the bags to create collages according to your liking."

Or punch 4 holes into each end of a bag that is only half shrunken to create a perfect bangle. Use a few leather cord and jewelry clasps to affix to the bag and create a unique bracelet.
