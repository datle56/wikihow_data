That said, do give yourself a little grooming beforehand. If you’re looking sharp , they’re more likely to be impressed, and more likely to say yes, since you look like someone they can be proud to go with. You don’t need a tux (though that’d be quite the move), but make sure you’re showered, smell nice, and your teeth are brushed. Freshen up in the bathroom just before you ask to make sure your hair’s nice and there’s nothing in your teeth."
