Plus, if you make a mistake, it’ll be easier to go back in your work to see the error. Each fraction has a numerator (the number on the top) and a denominator (the number on the bottom). Separate the numerator from the denominator with a straight, horizontal line. [1] X Research source Try your best to keep your fractions in a straight line. This will just make it easier to stay organized and work efficiently."

For example, if you’re asked to solve for 5/6 * 2/3, the first thing you’ll need to do is multiply 5 * 2, which gives you 10. This will be the numerator for your answer.

You may be tempted to solve math problems in your head, but when you’re first starting out it’s a good idea to write everything down, step by step. This way, if you make a mistake, it’s easy to go back and see what happened so you can fix it moving forward. Fractions are made up of 2 parts, the numerator (the top number) and the denominator (the bottom number), and they are separated with a straight, horizontal line. To write a mixed number, put the whole number on the left-hand side of the fraction."

The first thing you need to do is change both of those mixed fractions into improper fractions, meaning that the numerator will be greater than the denominator. Here’s how to do this: [9] X Research source 1 and 3/4 = 7/4 when it’s made into an improper fraction. The denominator will always stay the same when making improper fractions. Multiply the denominator by the whole number (4 *1) and add that answer to the current numerator (3). (4*1) + 3 = 7. For 7 and 1/5, multiply the denominator by the whole number (5*7) and add that answer to the current numerator (1). (5*7) + 1 = 36. Put the new numerator over the original denominator for your improper fraction. 7 and 1/5 = 36/5."

While you could just multiply the numerators and the denominators, it will be easier to do the math if you can simplify the fractions first. When simplifying, check to see if the cross numerator and denominator can be divided equally by the same number. [11] X Research source 7 and 5 cannot be, but 36 and 4 are both equally divisible by 4. To get your simplified fraction: [12] X Research source Divide 4 by 4 to get 1, changing the first fraction from 7/4 to 7/1. Divide 36 by 4 to get 9, changing the second fraction from 36/5 to 9/5. You can also simplify single fractions if the numerator and denominator have a common factor. For example, if 7/4 were instead 8/4, you could simplify that fraction to 2/1."
