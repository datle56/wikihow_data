Set the Ace, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 in one row and King, Queen, Jack, 10, 9, and 8 in a row directly below the first. Set the 7 card on the end of the rows next to the 6 and 8. [2] X Research source You’ll place your chips on the cards when you want to make a bet. If you’re playing at a casino, the card ranks will be printed on the table."

      "content": "Shuffle a full deck of cards. Use a standard 52-card deck with all 4 suits and choose someone to be the dealer, also known as the banker. Mix the cards up really well and be careful not to let any of the other players see the order of the cards. [3] X Research source If you want a more secure way to prevent people from peeking at the cards, load the deck into a dealing shoe . A shoe is a container you can draw the cards from while still keeping the deck hidden."

Take the soda card off of the deck and set it to the side for everyone to see. [4] X Research source Variation : Keep the soda card face-down and hidden from other players. That way, they won’t be able to count cards and their bets will be more of a gamble."

      "content": "Place a betting chip on which card rank you think will be drawn second. Start with the player to the left of the dealer. Make a guess at which card you think the banker will draw from the deck during the round. When you make your decision, take one of the chips from your stack and place it on top of the card rank in the middle of the table. You only need to bet on the rank of the card. The suit doesn’t matter for your bet. Multiple players can bet on the same card rank."

Take any chips you won back into your own personal stack. If you placed your bet on the losing rank, then you lose them to the banker. If the winning and losing cards are the same rank, then you win back half of your bet. If no one wins the bet, all of the bets stay on the table and you continue playing."

If you place the chip in the middle of the 2 rows so it touches the corners of 4 cards, then you place your bet on all of them. If any of the cards are the winning rank, you still win at 1 to 1 odds, but you lose if any of the cards are the loser.

Anyone that notices a bet on a rank that can’t be drawn anymore can say “dead bet,” and immediately earn the value of the bet.
