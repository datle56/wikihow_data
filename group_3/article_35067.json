      "title": "Comb your bangs forward.",
      "content": "Comb your bangs forward. This style works on medium to long length hair. Most side-swept bangs are about jaw-length, you but can try shorter ones that skim the tops of your cheekbones instead. Make sure that your hair is dry. If your hair is curly, then straighten it before cutting to ensure that you get an accurate cut."

      "title": "Create a V-shaped part in your bangs.",
      "content": "Create a V-shaped part in your bangs. Find the point on your center part where it begins to curve downward towards your forehead. It is usually a few inches/centimeters from your hairline. Use the handle of a rat-tail comb to create an angled part going from that point, down towards your left eyebrow. Leave your bangs loose and clip the rest of your hair out of the way. Repeat the process for the right side of the part as well. [1] X Research source If your part is off-center, then the point of the V should be on the off-center part. Keep in mind that your bangs won't be the same thickness due to one side having more hair."

    {
      "title": "Pinch one side of your bangs between your fingers.",
      "content": "Pinch one side of your bangs between your fingers. Pick a side on your part to start from: left or right. Make a V-shape with your forefinger and middle finger, then close them across your bangs. Slide your fingers down to where you want the shortest part of the bangs to start. How high you start is up to you, but somewhere between eyebrow and nose level is a safe bet. [2] X Research source If you created an off-set part, choose the wider side, or the side that has more hair. Consider misting or wetting your bangs with water first, especially if they are curly. This will help lubricate your hair and prevent snags. It also straightens wavy or curly hair, making it easier to get an even cut. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Carve the bangs at a downward angle with a razor comb. Begin cutting on the side closest to the part. Hold the razor comb perpendicular against the side of the bangs as you cut; don't keep the comb parallel to the top of the bangs. Make sure that you are cutting above your finger. [4] X Research source You can also use a feather razor for this step. It looks a little like a serrated knife."

      "content": "Slide your fingers down as you cut towards the other side of your bangs. Keep your fingers at a sight angle as you slide them. This will help define the angle even more. Finish cutting at the height where you want the side bangs to end. Somewhere between your cheekbones and jaw would look great. [5] X Research source At this point, you can move onto the next step, or you can repeat the process to trim the bangs shorter. Make sure to cut gradually while checking the length."

Run the razor downwards, curving it against your finger. [6] X Research source The razor won't cut your finger due to the protective guard."
