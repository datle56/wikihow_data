      "content": "Use plastic glue to fix small cracks in plastic. If you need to reconnect a crack in plastic, you can use plastic glue, which is specially formulated to bond plastic surfaces. Plastic glue is often used for making models so it is easy to use and safe to handle for adults. Make sure you have enough to connect the whole crack, you don’t want to have to stop after you’ve started applying strong glue! [1] X Research source You can use most super glues as well, but check the packaging to make sure it can be applied to plastic."

      "title": "Apply the glue to the edges of the crack.",
      "content": "Apply the glue to the edges of the crack. Squeezing the tube gently, spread a layer over the edges you will reconnect. Keep a cloth or wipe nearby in case you pour too much and dab any excess glue immediately to prevent it from hardening. Glue dries fast to be sure you are ready to connect the cracked plastic before you start applying! [2] X Research source Strong glues have strong fumes. Work in a well-ventilated area or wear a facemask when handling the glue. Wear gloves when using strong glue to prevent it from getting onto your skin and becoming painful to remove ."

      "title": "Allow the glue to fully cure.",
      "content": "Allow the glue to fully cure. Once you’ve connected the cracks in the plastic, it’s very important that you let glue fully set before using the plastic. Different glues have different drying times, so check the packaging for specific drying time. Wait at least 1 hour before using the repaired plastic. [4] X Research source You can make glue dry faster if you don’t have time to wait for it to cure."

      "title": "Reconnect small cracks in plastic using hot water.",
      "content": "Reconnect small cracks in plastic using hot water. Plastics often do not need extreme heat to become malleable enough to repair a crack. Soaking the plastic in hot water can make the plastic soft enough to mold and reconnect the edges of the crack. You can make the plastic set almost instantaneously by quickly submerging it in cold water. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Fill a container of hot water and a container of cold water. Fill a bowl or container with enough hot water to submerge the cracked piece of plastic. Then fill a container with cold water and keep it nearby so you can set the plastic after you’ve repaired the crack. [6] X Research source Make sure you don't overfill the containers so the water doesn't spill over the sides when you submerge the plastic. The water should not be boiling when you submerge the plastic."

      "content": "Place the cracked plastic in the hot water. You may not need to fully submerge the entire piece of plastic since you’re only repairing a crack and not remolding the whole piece. Different types of plastic may take longer to become malleable in the water. Leave the cracked plastic in the water for at least 30 seconds. [7] X Research source Take the plastic out of the water periodically to test if it is soft enough to mold. You can use tongs to hold the plastic in the hot water. Don’t slosh the plastic around in the water. Allow it to sit undisturbed."

      "content": "Submerge the plastic in the cold water to set. Once you have reconnected the edges of the crack, it’s important that you quickly cool the warm plastic so that it sets into place. Fully submerge the plastic into the container of cool water. Do not move it around in the water and allow it to sit for at least 30 seconds. You can use a C-clamp to hold the crack together when you submerge it in the cold water, just be sure not to squish the plastic so it’s uneven when it sets. Take the plastic out of the water and check to see that it has hardened completely before using it. [9] X Research source Submerge as much as the plastic as you can. Cooling the entire piece will help the recently molded plastic set better."

[11] X Research source Use a glass or ceramic bowl and fill it with enough acetone to completely submerge a few pieces of scrap plastic. It may be difficult to fully clean the melted plastic when you’re finished, so use a bowl you don’t mind ruining. Acetone can emit noxious fumes, so be sure you’re working in a well-ventilated area or wearing a facemask when you use it."

      "content": "Let the plastic pieces dissolve in the acetone overnight. The plastic will slowly disintegrate into a thick slurry. [13] X Research source Depending on the pieces of scrap plastic, the time it takes to fully break down may vary. A safe bet is to allow the plastic to sit in the acetone for over 8 hours. You can speed up the time it takes the scrap plastic to break down by cutting it into smaller pieces. If the plastic sludge has any large lumps of plastic in it, it may need more time to disintegrate."

Carefully drain the acetone in the sink, leaving only the melted plastic behind. Be careful not to breathe in the fumes. [14] X Research source Acetone can eat through plastic and damage your grass so do not empty the acetone in the garbage or outside! Any small amount of acetone left in the container will evaporate quickly."

      "content": "Use a soldering iron to fix larger cracks in plastic. A simple soldering iron is a great way to fix a crack in plastic. The focused heat from the iron allows you to melt only the edges of the crack so you can reconnect them easily without melting or warping any of the rest of the plastic. They are also easy to use and do not require any extra material. [17] X Research source Soldering irons are available at hardware stores and the home improvement section of many stores for about $10."

      "content": "Let the soldering iron heat up. Plug in and turn on your soldering iron and set it to the lowest setting. It may take a little while for the iron to heat up, but you can use this time to prepare the rest of your materials. You don’t want to use the soldering iron until it has reached the set temperature or your plastic may weld unevenly. [18] X Research source Do not rest the soldering iron on anything flammable while it heats up. Make sure the tip of the soldering iron is clean of any residue. Plastic melts much easier than metal, so your soldering iron does not need be higher than 400 °F (204 °C)."

Try not to stretch or bend the rest of the plastic. If the edges of the crack cannot connect, you use a small piece of scrap plastic as a patch by melting the edges of the patch and the edges of the crack, and then fusing them together. [19] X Research source Use a clamp to hold the crack together and allow you to use both of your hands to solder. If you do use a piece of scrap plastic as a patch, cut the plastic to a size that fits the crack, and try to use the same type and color of plastic."

Be sure to heat the plastic evenly so it fuses together smoothly. Allow the plastic to fully cool before using it. [20] X Research source There should not be a flame or a lot of smoke. The soldering iron will be very hot, so take be careful not to burn yourself or anything around you when you’re handling it. Melting plastic can put off fumes that are harmful. Work in a well-ventilated area or wear a breathing mask to avoid breathing in the fumes."
