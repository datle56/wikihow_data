      "content": "Root forsythia after the bush has finished blooming and all of its flowers have fallen off. Most garden experts recommend rooting forsythia indoors between December and February. The plant is dormant during this time, so the plant will be in the hardwood stage and cuttings will be less perishable. You can root forsythia year-round, but cuttings taken when the bush isn’t dormant will be more fragile and require more care and attention."

[1] X Trustworthy Source Royal Horticultural Society Leading gardening charity in the U.K. providing resources for identifying, growing and caring for flowers and other plants Go to source Choose a location where water drains off quickly. This will prevent new roots from rotting before they can grow strong. Add mulch or topsoil to the soil to boost acidity. Add straw or cedar shavings over the topsoil once your cutting is planted to insulate it and help encourage growth. Use a growth hormone in the soil to help the cuttings take root. Some hormones can be applied directly to the end of the cutting instead of in the soil. Use a planting box to start cuttings along in the winter months and to help control soil content."

Remove any leaves or leftover flowers. Clippings with buds still on them will encourage root growth. The best branches to cut will have 4 to 6 buds on them. Plant your cuttings deep enough so that only about 3 or 4 inches (7.6 or 10.2 cm) of the cutting is left sticking out of the soil. Use a shovel or trowel to pack dirt around the rest of the cutting."

      "content": "Make sure clippings have plenty of shade when rooting and aren’t exposed to lots of direct sunlight. Keep clippings watered regularly. Keep weeds and other plants cleared so the rooting forsythia has plenty of room to grow. If you’re rooting your forsythia indoors, make sure the planter box you choose has drainage holes in the bottom to keep the soil well-drained for the cuttings."
