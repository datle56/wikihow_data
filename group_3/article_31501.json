      "content": "It's a trend where a student shouts \"Oi oi oi baka!\" in school or in public. They usually do it on a dare or because they want to film it and go viral on TikTok and YouTube Shorts. To start the trend, the student says, \"Oi oi oi baka\" (or sometimes just \"Baka\") out loud in a quiet voice. Then, they repeat the phrase 2 or 3 more times, saying it louder each time. The last time they say it, they stand up on a chair or desk (if there's one nearby), throw their arms out, and shout, putting special emphasis on the last word, \"baka.\" [1] X Research source In one variation of this trend, the person doing it holds their hands up on either side of their head and sticks out their tongue (like the student in this viral TikTok by @irenic.7 or this one from @galuch__ ). Some teens perform this trend during class or recess at school. Even though they're loud and disruptive, they have no intention of hurting anyone or starting a fight. They take a big risk, though, because their teacher may get annoyed or even angry and discipline them. Plus, other students might think they're immature and may not want to be friends with them."

      "content": "\"Oi oi oi baka\" means \"Hey, hey, hey, idiot\" in Japanese. People in Japan sometimes say, \"Oi oi oi\" (pronounced oy-oy-oy ) to show surprise, disbelief, exasperation, or playful, unserious frustration. [2] X Research source If they add \"baka\" ( bah-kah ) to the end, they're probably expressing their annoyance with someone and calling them an idiot. If a person directs these phrases to you, they may be referencing the anime or insulting you because you're doing something that irritates them."

      "content": "We don't know why or how the trend of saying, \"Oi oi oi baka\" started. It may be at least partly inspired by a character named Bakugou (also spelled Bakugo) in an extremely popular anime series called My Hero Academia . In a scene where he's confronting another character, Bakugou says, \"Oi oi oi!\" in a frustrated, annoyed tone of voice. [3] X Research source It's not clear how \"baka\" got added to the trend, though, because Bakugou never actually says, \"Oi oi oi baka\" at any point in the anime. Some sources on the internet say this trend makes fun of people who are My Hero Academia fans. Are you a fan of MHK and want to know which character you're most like?

      "content": "It's popular because it gets millions of views and likes on social media. The potential upside of a trend like this is that it can get a lot of laughs and help the person doing it let off steam. The downsides are that it gets them in trouble with their teachers, annoys the people around them, interrupts learning time, and makes them look immature. The student might also get punished at home if their teacher tells their parents that they were disrespectful and disruptive during class. This \"oi oi oi baka\" TikTok by @porky_puu has generated 4 million likes since the creator posted it on May 17, 2024."

      "content": "\"OI OI OI Bakugou\" is a song inspired by Bakugou from My Hero Academia. It was released in 2020 by La Memerano and features a famous clip of Bakugou saying, \"Oi oi oi.\" You might hear it if you come across a meme of a South Korean cartoon character named Red Larva on your TikTok or YouTube Shorts feed. [4] X Research source The larva typically has a speech bubble next to it with the text \"Oi oi oi\" inside. [5] X Research source The SHX4 Brazilian Funk remix of \"OI OI OI Bakugou\" is also extremely popular."
