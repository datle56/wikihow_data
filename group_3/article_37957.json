      "content": "A Sagittarius man and a Capricorn woman have moderate compatibility. These two definitely have what it takes to go the distance. The problem is that they have so little in common it's really rare for them to cross paths. And, if they do, they're pretty unlikely to see anything of interest in each other. But if they do catch each other's attention, they'll find that despite their differences they complement each other magically. Sagittarius is ruled by Jupiter and Capricorn is ruled by Saturn. These two planets usually have a positive effect on each other—these two signs can really be their best selves when they're together! As a cardinal sign, a Capricorn lady is happy to take charge of practical matters. This works well for the mutable Sagittarius man, who doesn't like it when he's saddled with too much responsibility.

      "content": "Sagittarius and Capricorn tend to move at a different paces in bed. Sagittarius guys love to get wild and experimental in the sack, but a Capricorn lady tends to prefer a slow, sensual encounter.

Sagittarius, make sure your Capricorn lady knows how much you respect her and she's more likely to be interested in getting sexy with you. Capricorn, be willing to let loose a little in bed. Talk to your archer about your interests and your limits, then don't be afraid to try new things and spice it up !"

      "content": "Sea-goats and archers both communicate clearly and directly. Both signs value honesty and know they can count on each other to always be truthful. Neither sign is very secretive, either, which makes it a lot easier for them to trust each other. Both are happy supporting each other even though they might be pursuing different goals.

While it's great that you're honest, your words can easily hurt her if you don't put things delicately. [2] X Research source Capricorn, don't forget that listening is a huge part of communication!

There are almost always going to be difficulties when a fire sign like Sagittarius gets together with an earth sign like Capricorn, and these two are no exception.

He might see her as too rigid, while she could see him as too volatile and prone to take unnecessary risks. Lots of communication is important if these two want to get on the same page—and stay there. Sagittarius, get comfortable going off on your own. Your Capricorn lady would usually prefer to stick close to home, but she'll be waiting to hear all about your latest adventure. Capricorn, trust your archer enough to give him space.
