Keep in mind that because the deck will be divided among all the players after the starting word is made, more players means fewer cards in each person's hand. [1] X Research source"

They are printed with a letter on each side, or with a letter on one side and a blank space on the other. Either side of the card may be played to make a legal word, with the blank serving as a \"wild letter\" as in the Scrabble board game. [5] X Research source Get into the habit of looking at the upper left edge of your cards, rather than flipping them back and forth. At the upper left edge you can see the two letters that the card represents."

If you are playing with young children, then you may want to consider making teams to give them more chances to play. [7] X Research source Words in Scrabble Slam! are restricted the same as in the Scrabble crossword game: you can't use slang, acronyms, proper names for people or places, hyphenated words, or words with apostrophes. You cannot play the same letter if it will make the same word. For example, if the current word is \"BALE,\" you cannot play another \"B\" immediately on top of the \"B\" in the word. You can, however, play a \"G\" to change the word to \"GALE\" and then play a \"B\" to change the word back to \"BALE\" if you can do so before another player changes the word to something else."

Then, stop playing to discuss the word's legitimacy and consult a dictionary if necessary. If the word is not a legal Scrabble Slam! word, the player making the word must take back the letter card used to make it. [8] X Research source"

If someone gets rid of all of his or her cards first, that player is the winner. If all of the players still have cards and no one can make a play, then whoever has the fewest cards left is the winner. [9] X Research source"
