After joining, you will get invitations to forays at local parks where you can learn from experienced mushroom pickers. You may also get invited to special mushroom dinners and lectures on the science of mycology. You will typically pay a small membership fee. For instance, the Wisconsin mycology society has forays, lectures, dinners and workshops on mushrooms. [2] X Research source The Mycological Society of Toronto runs forays in the spring and fall picking seasons, hosts dinners and runs lectures. It also has a quarterly newsletter called “Mycelium.” [3] X Research source"

Think of a few adjectives to describe the smell, such as sweet or smokey, and use these adjectives to start the identification process. How does your mushroom smell? Does the mushroom smell generically fungal or phenolic? Don’t taste the mushroom until you have finished the complete identification process."

You’ll also want to look at how they connect to the stalk. The texture is also important to consider, as well as whether any liquid oozes from the gills. By asking yourself questions about the gills, you can begin the identification process: [10] X Research source Are the gills covered by a veil of thin, felt-like, or cobwebby tissue? See if the gills are connected to the stalk. If so, do they run down the stalk, meet it at a right angle, or barely touch it? This character, like color, can change in age! Does your mushroom have plate-like gills under the cap surface, wrinkles, spongy tubes, or something else? Do you see liquid oozing from the gills?"

Is the mushroom growing on dead wood, living tree, soil, moss, or something else entirely? While fungi can form associations with many plants, trees are the most relevant to identification. If you can't tell the species of tree exactly, at least note whether conifers, hardwoods, or both are present. Which trees are present in the area? Make a note if your mushroom is growing in a lawn, on sand, on moss, on another mushroom, or any other site of interest."

Cut off the stem of the mushroom and place the cap down on a piece of paper. Place a cup over the mushroom. Wait overnight and then remove the cup and the mushroom to see the spore print. If the mushroom is dropping spores, you will see them dusting the paper, allowing you to determine their color. [12] X Research source If you anticipate a dark spore print, you should use white paper. If you anticipate a white or light spore print, you should use dark paper. If you have a sheet of glass, you can use it for the spore print. The terms for spore color can be very precise. Chocolate brown, tobacco brown, and rusty brown are entirely different colors!"

The best way to differentiate a chanterelle mushroom, which is edible, from a jack-o’-lantern, which is poisonous, is to look at the gills. A chanterelle mushroom has fake gills that run down the stem and are not easily removed from the cap. They look like they have been melted. In contrast, a jack-o’-lantern has true gills that look like little blades that don’t run down the stem. [19] X Research source A jack-o’-lantern or false chanterelle is deep orange. In contrast, a chanterelle mushroom can be anything from light yellow or orange yellow. Whereas jack-o’-lanterns grow in bunches that are attached at the stem, chanterelles like to grow alone or in small bunches and with separate stems. Jack-o'-lanterns glow in the dark. If you are able to, check the place where you found the mushroom at night to see if it glows."

If they look old or decaying, leave them in the ground. They should store for a week at home. Be sure to dig your mushroom out in a way that leaves the base of the stalk undamaged! Do not pull it up.

As such, ignore the following rules of thumb: “If an animal has nibbled the mushroom, it is fine.” This is not true. “You can get rid of poisons by cooking the mushrooms.” This is also false. Although some mushrooms, such as morels, are made edible through cooking, and cooking will get rid of harmful bacteria and make edible mushrooms much more digestible, not all mushrooms are made safe through cooking. “Mushrooms that smell good must be edible.” Although smell can be a good way to distinguish between edible and poisonous varieties, such as distinguishing between Agaricus Campestris and Agaricus Xanthodermus (the former smells like portobello, and the latter like chemicals), this doesn't work for all mushrooms."
