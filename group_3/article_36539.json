If the label on the garment tag says “Dry Clean Only,” take it to the dry cleaners right away. Point the stain out to the cleaner so they know exactly what kind of stain they’re dealing with. If the label does not say “Dry Clean Only,” you can try to get the stain out yourself using some household products."

You can also leave the garment to soak overnight if the stain is particularly big. Consider adding a small amount of detergent (a few tablespoons for 1 gallon of water) or bleach to the cold water soak. [1] X Research source However, only add bleach if the garment is white."

Mix together 3 cups of white vinegar and 1 cup of cold water in a bucket, bowl, or sink. Add the cotton garment to the solution and let it soak for about 30 minutes. Alternatively, you could spray the vinegar solution straight onto the stain, and allow it to sit for approximately 30 minutes. If the stain remains after the soak, pour some table salt onto the stain and rub the fabric and salt together with you fingers."

Rub the salted lemon on the stained cup or dish in small circular motions. The acidity of the lemon peel and the abrasiveness of the salt will remove the tea stain. Apply more salt as needed until the surface is clean."

Mix together baking soda with a little bit of water in a small dish. You want the paste to be thick enough that you can rub it onto the stained area with a cloth or paper towel. Use some pressure to rub the tea stains out of the dish or cup. After a few minutes the stain can be rinsed away. [5] X Research source"
