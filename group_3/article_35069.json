      "title": "Wait at least two weeks before applying another color.",
      "content": "Wait at least two weeks before applying another color. Applying dye again too soon after coloring your hair can cause extensive damage and breakage. Additionally, you will have no way to predict how the color will look, since you’re dyeing over an existing dye-job. The example color on the box will not be applicable on top of dye. [1] X Research source Keep in mind that color doesn't lift color. You won't be able to go from a dark dyed color to a lighter color without using bleach or some form of a color correction process first. Generally, it’s best to wait four to seven weeks before re-dyeing your hair so that you don’t damage it, but you can try to dye it earlier if you really hate your current dye-job. [2] X Research source If you’re re-dyeing just to have a change, wait at least four weeks to apply the new color. If you simply need to adjust the tone, go to a professional that can assess when's the best time to make the color correction without damaging your hair."

      "title": "Choose a darker shade for a better result.",
      "content": "Choose a darker shade for a better result. It’s easier to darken your hair than it is to lighten, so a darker shade is more likely to absorb into already dyed hair. It’s also less damaging to your hair than a bleach would be. Since you’re already on your second process, avoiding additional damage is a must. If you must lighten your hair, visit a stylist. Trying to re-dye your hair a lighter shade will most likely come out wrong and cause extensive damage to your hair. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Avoid re-dyeing if your hair is severely damaged.",
      "content": "Avoid re-dyeing if your hair is severely damaged. Hair that is dry, breaking, or has excessive split ends needs a break from processing. No matter how much you want to change up your look, applying dye to damaged hair will only make it look worse. Instead, apply a deep conditioner and make an appointment with a stylist, who can help you determine when and if you can safely re-dye your hair. [4] X Research source Signs you have damaged hair include split ends, loss of bounce, excessive tangles, and dry, brittle strands. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Use a color-stripping product to remove unwanted color. You may want to remove the old color before you try to re-dye your hair, especially if you’re making a big change. These products remove dye already on your hair so that the new color can absorb into your hair. [6] X Research source Using a color-stripper will allow you to make bigger changes in your hair color because you can start fresh. Otherwise, you will be applying dye on top of dye, which can make it harder to get the color you want. You can find an at-home color stripper at a beauty supply store, or you can visit a salon to have a professional treatment applied."

      "content": "Wrap a towel around your neck. The towel will protect your clothes and skin from the dye. Secure the towel with a clip or rubber band so that it doesn’t come off while you’re in the middle of applying the product. Choose an old towel or one that is dark colored because the towel will most likely be stained by the hair dye. Lift your arms up to your hair a few times to make sure that the towel is secure and won’t fall off while you're in the middle of dying your hair. Alternatively, you could use a hairdresser's cape if you have one."

      "content": "Apply the dye to the sections. Start about ½-inch from your scalp and work your way through your hair. Coat your hair with the dye so that each section is completely covered. Continue applying the dye until each section is covered with dye. When you're finished, cover your hair in a shower cap if you have one. If you use a shower cap, it will hold in your body's natural heat, which helps the dye absorb faster."

      "content": "Allow the dye to set for the recommended time. Set a timer to make sure that you don’t leave the dye on too long. Don’t let the dye stay on too long because it can damage your hair. If you’re covering gray, let your hair set for the longest amount of time allowed."

Start applying the product on your scalp and work your way until you reach the end of the new growth. Leave the ends of your hair untreated. Don't stress out about a little bit of overlap where the new growth ends. That hair is still fresh and won't be as porous as the hair near the ends, meaning that it won't absorb as much color.

Gently squeeze your hair to re-activate the dye, bringing it down through your ends. [16] X Research source This works well to refresh your color when you're reapplying the same shade, but it won't darken your hair.

If you don't need to refresh the color on your ends and are afraid that they will darken when you do your roots, apply conditioner to the bottom of your hair so that the dye can't absorb.

      "content": "Avoid using boxed hair dye over a professional dye job. Boxed dyes are more drying than professional dyes, so they will increase the damage on your hair. Not only that, but the compounding of color can make it hard to predict the results. Once you’ve added the boxed dye, it will be hard for anyone to fix your hair color if you don’t like the results. [19] X Research source Your stylist may be able to gently change the color by applying a toner rather than re-dying it, so talk to them before you try anything drastic. [20] X Research source"

If you don’t tell your stylist that you’ve already used dye, your hair may not come out as expected. Trust your stylist to help you make the best choice to keep your hair healthy. [22] X Research source Tell them how many times you’ve dyed your hair, as well as how often. Say, “I’ve already used two different box dyes. I put the first one on three weeks ago, and last week I tried to fix the color.” Explain what you don’t like about your current color so that they can help fix the issue you’re having. Say, “I don’t like how brassy my hair looks.”"
