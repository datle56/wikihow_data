      "title": "Try over-the-counter pain medications.",
      "content": "Try over-the-counter pain medications. If you have a mild case of peripheral neuropathy pain, you may be able to minimize it with over-the-counter pain medications, such as acetaminophen or NSAIDs like ibuprofen. Take the recommended dose that is listed on the packaging and follow the recommendations for how often to take it. [1] X Research source Talk to your doctor before taking over-the-counter pain medications if you are taking other medications as well."

      "title": "Rub on capsaicin oils and creams to minimize pain.",
      "content": "Rub on capsaicin oils and creams to minimize pain. Capsaicin products contain cayenne-pepper oil, which overloads the nerves and causes pain receptors to shut down. Rub a capsaicin cream onto the painful area of your feet up to 3 times a day to relieve pain. This is a temporary but often helpful treatment. [2] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source You can find capsaicin cream over-the-counter. Look for a product labeled as a 0.025% capsaicin cream, such as Zostrix. Capsaicin oils, creams, and salves can cause burning on the skin when applied. This sensation will be manageable for some but may be too uncomfortable for others to use regularly. Because capsaicin products contain pepper oil, avoid getting it in wounds, your eyes, or your mouth. Use gloves to apply it and keep the products off surfaces that you may touch later."

      "content": "Rub camphor, peppermint, or lavender oil on your feet several times a day. While you can use straight camphor oil, experiment with rubbing in drops of camphor combined with a drop or 2 of olive oil or your favorite moisturizing lotion. You can also use the typical \"vapor rub\", which is usually a mixture of menthol and eucalyptus in petroleum jelly. If you like, you can also use peppermint or lavender oil for added benefits. Camphor oil will help numb your nerves, which minimizes pain. Peppermint oil helps relax your muscles. Lavender oil may help you calm down and relax, which can reduce pain. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Consult with a neurologist about pain management. An experienced neurologist is likely to understand the neurological pain you are enduring more than a typical primary care physician is. They should also know the best treatments or prescription drugs you can use to reduce your pain. A neurologist is a specialist that deals specifically with nerves and the overall nervous system."

      "content": "Take prescription meditations to help calm the nerves and pain. Talk to your doctor about prescription medications that can reduce your pain. Cymbalta and Lyrica are relatively new drugs that help to reduce neuropathic pain. Both require a prescription from a doctor. Older drugs like Neurontin can also be helpful but may have undesirable side effects. More traditional pain killers, such as those that contain opioids, can be extremely habit forming, so other pain killers are often prescribed first and these are only used if others do not relieve pain satisfactorily. [4] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Lyrica has side effects, including weight gain and dizziness, and can be habit forming if not taken as directed.

      "title": "Take antidepressants to treat your pain.",
      "content": "Take antidepressants to treat your pain. There has been some success with using antidepressants to treat peripheral neuropathy. These medications make chemical changes in your brain that block the nerve's ability to signal pain. Some common medications that may be prescribed include tricyclic antidepressants and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). Examples of SSRIs include Prozac, Paxil, and Zoloft. Common tricyclic antidepressants include amitriptyline and nortriptyline. These may help reduce your nerve pain. Many of these medications do have side effects, including dry mouth, dizziness, nausea, and constipation."

      "content": "Have transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) done. This is a non-invasive treatment that uses very small electrical currents to interrupt the nerve signals that are telling the brain that you are in pain. This is a relatively new and experimental treatment that does show promise but needs more study. This treatment has mainly been used to treat peripheral neuropathy associated with diabetes. Talk to your doctor about whether this treatment is available in your area."

      "content": "Keep an eye on the health of your feet. Get a foot examination once a year from a qualified podiatrist. However, you should also check your feet yourself daily for signs of poor circulation or injuries. Some symptoms of poor circulation include excessive blisters, cuts, or calluses. [6] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Make sure you thoroughly wash your feet every day. When you dry them, pay special attention to between your toes. Talk to your podiatrist about how to check your feet, including what to be on the lookout for when checking them."

      "content": "Avoid prolonged nerve pressure. Wear soft, loose cotton socks and padded shoes, with good arch support. Replace shoes that cause blisters. Tight shoes and socks can worsen pain and tingling, plus they can lead to sores that won't heal. [7] X Research source Also, don't sit too long or keep your legs or knees crossed. Always wear well-fitting shoes and socks. You may want to get special therapeutic shoes that will reduce pressure on your feet. Try using a semicircular hoop, which is available in medical supply stores, to keep bed covers off hot or sensitive feet while you sleep. Take care to avoid injury or infections in your feet. Don't put your body into positions or use products that reduce the circulation in your feet."

It also stimulates nerves and may temporarily relieve pain."

Not all of these causes can be treated, but many can. For instance, diabetes often leads to this condition. If you have a connected condition like diabetes, it's important to keep that condition treated effectively.

Alcohol can cause problems with nerve communication and excessive use can cause nutritional problems that also inhibit nerve function. [16] X Research source If you cannot eliminate your alcohol consumption completely, try to keep it down to 1 or 2 drinks per day. Continuing to drink while coping with peripheral neuropathy will likely make your symptoms worse."
