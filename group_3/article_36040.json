      "title": "Use a non-medicated saline nasal spray to loosen the mucus.",
      "content": "Use a non-medicated saline nasal spray to loosen the mucus. Use the spray in both nostrils every 2-3 hours. This will loosen the mucus in your sinuses and relieve pressure. Shake the medication and insert the tip into your right nostril. Cover the left nostril with your fingertip. Breathe through your mouth, and spray the saline into your nostril. Breathe in through your nose again. Repeat for the other side.

      "title": "Switch to a medicated nasal spray if saline spray does not help.",
      "content": "Switch to a medicated nasal spray if saline spray does not help. You can also purchase an over-the-counter nasal spray that contains a corticosteroid medication. This will help to reduce swelling and inflammation in your sinuses. If you do not experience relief from a non-medicated saline spray, then try a medicated nasal spray. Use the medication for 1-2 weeks before deciding if it's effective, as it takes a week or 2 for the medicine to start working. For instance, you can find Flonase and Nasacort over-the-counter. Both contain corticosteroids to help relieve your sinus pressure. Use the medicated spray in the same way as the non-medicated kind, but make sure to check the manufacturer's dosing instructions."

[5] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Don't take your decongestant for longer than 3-5 days, unless your doctor instructs you to do so. Using a decongestant for too long can cause rebound congestion, which means your symptoms may come back worse than before. For example, if you are also battling itchy eyes, then you might take something that also contains an antihistamine. If you have a headache, take a decongestant that contains a pain relieving medication. Some medications, like Mucinex D, both relieve mucus and act as a decongestant."
