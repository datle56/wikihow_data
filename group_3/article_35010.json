      "title": "Have your T3 and T4 levels tested, if you haven’t already.",
      "content": "Have your T3 and T4 levels tested, if you haven’t already. TSH tells your thyroid to produce hormones called T3 and T4. If your TSH levels are low and your T3 and T4 levels are high, your thyroid is overactive. If your TSH, T3, and T4 levels are all low, you might have a pituitary gland disorder. [1] X Trustworthy Source MedlinePlus Collection of medical information sourced from the US National Library of Medicine Go to source Your doctor will order a blood test to measure your hormone levels. They might also test for antibodies, which would indicate an infection, or perform a radioactive iodine uptake scan to see if your thyroid is overactive. [2] X Research source When the pituitary gland produces higher levels of TSH, it usually means the thyroid isn’t making enough hormones. Low TSH levels usually mean the thyroid is producing too many hormones. It usually takes 24 to 48 hours to get results for TSH and thyroid hormone tests."

      "content": "Ask your doctor if you take any medications that suppress TSH levels. Some medications for asthma, inflammation, Parkinson’s disease, and cancer can cause low TSH levels. Tell your doctor about all medications you take, and ask if they recommend any changes to your regimen. [3] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source You might not be able to stop taking certain medications, so your doctor might just monitor your condition. If you experience unusual symptoms, such as rapid heartbeat or unexplained weight loss, your doctor might recommend thyroid medication."

      "content": "Adjust your dosage if you take medication for hypothyroidism . High T3 and T4 counts along with low TSH levels are signs that you’re taking too much medication for an underactive thyroid. Your doctor will decrease your dose, then they’ll check your levels at a follow-up appointment to make sure the adjustment worked. [4] X Trustworthy Source MedlinePlus Collection of medical information sourced from the US National Library of Medicine Go to source You'll likely see your doctor again within 6 weeks of changing your dose. They'll check your levels and, if necessary, make further adjustments. High or low hormone levels are common during treatment for hypothyroidism, and finding the right balance can take time. If you take thyroid medication, you'll most likely have your hormone levels tested every 6 to 12 months once the levels are stable and every 6 to 8 weeks after a dose change."

      "title": "Get tested for a pituitary gland disorder if your T4 levels are low.",
      "content": "Get tested for a pituitary gland disorder if your T4 levels are low. If your test results show that your thyroid hormone levels are also low, there might be something preventing your pituitary gland from producing TSH. If necessary, your doctor will order blood work and imaging scans to check for a pituitary gland disorder. [5] X Research source Low TSH levels can be caused by pituitary gland tumors, which are almost always benign (not cancerous). If a tumor is detected, you’ll receive hormone or radiation therapy, or have it surgically removed. [6] X Research source Cases of low TSH levels due to a pituitary gland disorder are rare. Most of the time, an overactive thyroid gland is the issue."

      "content": "Take a prescription antithyroid medication for short-term management. Antithyroid medications are usually only taken for a few weeks, or until a patient undergoes radioactive iodine therapy, which is the most common treatment. Take your medication as directed, and don’t stop taking it without your doctor’s approval. [7] X Research source Antithyroid medications, such as methimazole, are usually taken with food every 8 hours.

      "content": "Control an overactive thyroid with radioactive iodine therapy. Most people with hyperthyroidism receive radioactive iodine therapy. Typically, you’ll take a single capsule or liquid dose of a substance that permanently destroys thyroid tissue. As a result of treatment, your thyroid will be underactive, and you’ll likely need to take medication to replace thyroid hormones. [9] X Research source You might experience a sore throat for a few days after taking radioactive iodine. Most of the radioactive material will be absorbed by your thyroid within 2 days, but your bodily fluids will also temporarily contain small amounts after treatment. You’ll need to take precautions to prevent exposing others to these traces of radioactive iodine. Your doctor will most likely instruct you to avoid contact with small children and pregnant women for several days. You should also avoid prolonged periods of intimate contact with other people for 3 to 4 days."

      "content": "Take medication for hypothyroidism as directed. Almost all people develop hypothyroidism, or an underactive thyroid, after receiving treatment for hyperthyroidism. Your doctor will prescribe a hormone replacement medication and monitor your TSH, T3, and T4 levels. You’ll need to remain on medication for hypothyroidism permanently and have your levels tested every 6 to 12 months when your levels are stable and 6 to 8 weeks after a dosage change to ensure that these counts are balanced. Make sure to take the medication without food or other medications to ensure that your body absorbs it properly.

If necessary, your doctor will adjust your dosage. You might have additional follow-up appointments every 2 to 3 months until your thyroid is regulated. It might seem strange that treatment for an overactive thyroid leads to an underactive thyroid. Hypothyroidism is easily managed with medication, but hyperthyroidism is a potentially life-threatening condition. Treatment for hyperthyroidism is necessary, even if it results in hypothyroidism."

Excessive exercise can cause heart problems and other medical issues. If you have hypothyroidism, your heart rate is slow, and excessive exercise is like a sudden, stressful jolt. Once you've regulated your hormone levels, moderately intense exercise, like walking briskly for 30 minutes a day, can boost your energy and control weight."
