For example, if you want to figure out the problem (7x6) you would touch your left ring finger with your right pinky. Your left fingers represent the number on the left of the problem, and your right fingers represent the numbers on the right of the problem. Again, remember that each finger represents a number and that in this case, your ring finger represents seven and your pinky represents six. Therefore, you need to touch these together to solve this math problem. [6] X Research source You may have to bend your wrist awkwardly to do this! As another example, if you were trying to calculate 9x7 you would touch your left index finger with your right ring finger."

These will represent the 10s. In this case you would count the ring finger on your left hand, the pinky on your left hand and the pinky on your right hand. Each finger that you count will count as 10. In this case, the total is 30. [7] X Research source"

Count the number of fingers below the touching fingers, including the fingers that are touching. There should be a total of 7, which remember means 70. Next, count the number of fingers above the touching fingers on your right and left hand. There should be 0 on your left and 3 on your right. Now multiply 3x0 which is 0, and add 70 to 0 for you answer. The answer to 10x7 is 70! [9] X Research source"
