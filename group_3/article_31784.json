Your Mini Cooper’s hood should have popped open. [3] X Research source If the hood is still closed, you may need to pull the latch harder. If the hood does not pop open after multiple attempts, the hood release cable may be broken. Ask a mechanic who is familiar with Mini Coopers to look at it for you."

However, the latch is located just to the left of the metal loop. The metal loops help keep the hood in place when it is closed."

If the cables are relatively easy to pull, they are loose. If the cables are taut with tension, then there may be another issue with the cables underneath the hood of the car.
