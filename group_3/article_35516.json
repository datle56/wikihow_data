Before we dive into a robust (but simple) tool, there might be an uncomplicated way you can restore the deleted folder without installing any software, especially if you regularly make backups. Press Windows key + E to open File Explorer, connect your backup drive (if you have one), and then try this quick trick: Navigate to the folder where the deleted folder was saved. For example, if you deleted a folder called \"Songs\" from your \"Downloads\" folder, locate the Downloads folder now. Right-click the folder and select Restore previous versions .

Go to source You'll see previous versions of the folder from system restore points and file history (backups). If you see any previous dates available, select a date before the folder was deleted and click Restore to choose a restore location. If no previous versions are available, continue to the next step."

Go to source If the shadow copies of the deleted files were not permanently deleted, you can usually restore deleted files this way. To install, click the ShadowExplorer Installer link near the top of the page to save the installer to your PC. Once downloaded, double-click the downloaded file (the one that ends with \"setup.exe\") and follow the on-screen instructions. VSS is not a replacement for normal backups, so you might not find everything you're looking for. But in many cases, you can restore important documents, photos, and other files you've accidentally deleted, even if they aren't in the Recycle Bin."

The best thing you can possibly do is to stop everything you're doing and run that software on it before something overwrites it with anything.
