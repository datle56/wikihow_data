Are you prepared to make the sacrifices necessary to raise a child? Do you genuinely want to be a parent? Consider, too, whether you want to have more than one child. Of course, people change their minds, but having an idea about how many children you'd like will help you plan for your family effectively."

What methods of education and discipline will you use? What kind of person do you want your child to become? Talk about potentially divisive topics, such as religion. If you and your partner have different religious backgrounds, you should try to decide in advance how you will deal with that issue. In what religion will you raise your child? What will you teach your child about religion?"
