      "content": "Feelings like sadness, shock, and guilt are normal parts of grieving. It’s normal and okay to experience a variety of deep, painful emotions in the aftermath of your pet’s passing. You might feel a sudden sense of shock as you remember your pet is gone, or feel incredibly sad as you mourn your life without them. Some pet owners may even feel guilty for the way their pet’s life ended, and the role they played in their pet’s end-of-life care.

Go to source The emotions of losing a pet can fall into the “Five Stages of Grief” model created by Elisabeth Kübler-Ross: denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance. You might experience these feelings in a completely different order, or only experience a couple of these emotions overall—it all depends on the individual. [2] X Research source There isn’t a “right” or “wrong” way to feel after you lose a pet. Every person’s relationship with their pet is different, and every person’s grieving process is different, too."
