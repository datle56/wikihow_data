      "title": "Keep the room cool but comfortable.",
      "content": "Keep the room cool but comfortable. Believe it or not, it is much easier to fall asleep in a cool environment than a toasty, well-heated room. Try to achieve a temperature in your bedroom between 60º and 67ºF (15.6–19.4ºC). Personal preference has an effect here too, but the ideal sleeping temperature for most people falls into this range. Try it and you may be surprised. Babies and toddlers sleep better at a slightly warmer temperature. Their ideal range is between 67 to 70 °F (19 to 21 °C)."

      "content": "Reduce sound and light. If you are a light sleeper, wear ear plugs and eye covers to prevent stimuli from waking you up. If early morning sunlight wakes you up, hang blackout curtains to block it. [1] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source"

      "content": "Consider white noise. If loud noises in the night are unavoidable, comforting background could help cover them up. Try running a whirring fan or playing quiet, calming instrumental music. If your room is dry, a humidifier can solve two issues at once.

      "title": "Pick a sleeping position.",
      "content": "Pick a sleeping position. This is especially important if you suffer from back or neck pain, but anyone can benefit from arranging themselves and their pillows in a comfortable position. [3] X Research source Try one of these: Sleep on your side, with your knees pulled up slightly toward your chest. Place a pillow between your knees to keep your pelvis and spine straight. Sleep on your back only if your mattress provides comfortable support. Try a second pillow beneath your knees and/or under the hollow of your back for additional support. Sleeping on your stomach is not recommended, as it can cause breathing issues and neck pain. If this is the only way you can fall asleep, sleep on the edge of a tall pillow, so you can tilt your head slightly for air flow, but don't need to wrench your neck to do so."

    {
      "title": "Test different pillow arrangements.",
      "content": "Test different pillow arrangements. Some people sleep without a pillow, while others prefer one or two large, soft pillows. Go with the option that keeps your neck and shoulders relaxed throughout the night. If you feel tense when you wake up, and can't find a pillow that works for you, try rolling up a towel and placing it under your neck for direct support. [4] X Research source If you can't find a comfortable position for your arms, try holding a large pillow, rolled up towel, or stuffed animal."

      "title": "Use heavy blankets in cool to normal temperature.",
      "content": "Use heavy blankets in cool to normal temperature. A heavier blanket or cover can increase your sense of security while falling asleep. Depending on personal preference and current weather, you may prefer a light quilt, a warm, thick comforter, or even a weighted bean blanket. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Get comfortable in hot weather.",
      "content": "Get comfortable in hot weather. Change your sleeping setup when the weather gets warmer, especially if you wake up sweaty or feeling trapped in the bedclothes. If you normally sleep naked under blankets, try sleeping in pajamas under just a sheet. Take a cool shower just before you go to bed. Turn on a fan to keep you and your room cool. If you don't have air conditioner, wet cloths or paper towels and drape them over your face and arms. Alternatively, attach a mister or fine mist gadget above your bed so that it can spray your face with cool water. For example, you could use a plant mister."

      "title": "Use your bed only for bedtime.",
      "content": "Use your bed only for bedtime. Work, games, and most other activities should be done at a table or desk instead of on the bed, and in another room whenever possible. Training yourself to associate the bed with sleep or calm bedtime activities can help trigger falling asleep more consistently. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Have a bedtime ritual. A way to wind down each night puts you in the right frame of mind for sleeping, especially if you repeat the same ritual every time. If lying awake in bed causes anxiety or fear, this is especially important. [7] X Research source Try the following ideas: Read a calm book. Listen to a book on tape or a podcast, with your eyes closed. If this keeps you up, listen to nature sounds instead. Eat a small snack if you tend to wake up hungry, such as a glass of milk, a banana, or a small bowl of low-sugar cereal. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Exercise earlier in the day. Exercising is a great idea, as long as you don't wake yourself up with a workout right before bed. Exhausting yourself to extreme fatigue will not produce restful sleep, but some form of physical activity is often a necessity to help you stick to a daily sleep schedule. [9] X Research source"

      "content": "Finish the day with a light meal. As mentioned above, your body slows down as it starts to sleep, including your metabolism. If you eat a heavy meal before bedtime, your slowed metabolism could keep you uncomfortably full – or return to \"active mode\" and produce unwanted energy."

      "title": "Be careful about hot showers and exercise before bed.",
      "content": "Be careful about hot showers and exercise before bed. When your body transitions from active to resting, everything slows down, and temperature drops. Raising the temperature from a hot shower or a workout session will slow that process down, making it more difficult to sleep. If you need exercise to get tired, or a shower to get comfortable, start it earlier so you have at least thirty minutes to cool down before going to sleep. If you want to shower right before bed, it's okay to take a warm shower, as this will not interfere with your sleep. [10] X Research source"

      "content": "Avoid stimulating vitamins, supplements, and foods. You probably know that caffeine and sugar keep you awake, including caffeine found in soda and chocolate. Other substances that disturb your sleep include B-vitamins, steroidal medication for asthma, beta-blockers, opiates, ginseng, and guarana.

Follow your doctor's instructions and skip the drug when possible to mitigate this situation."
