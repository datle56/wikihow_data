For example, they might play a single Queen or a pair of sevens. After placing their cards face-up on the table, their turn is over."

You can also beat their play by playing a matching set of cards, like a pair or 3 of a kind. If the person before you played a set of cards, you must play a set of higher ranking cards to beat their play. For example, you could beat a single 9 by playing a pair of eights or 3 Jacks.

You might play a 2 to clear the table when you don't have cards to beat the previous play. Once the table is cleared, you can play whatever you want.

If someone plays 2 threes, this will clear the table and start a new round (just like when a 2 is played). If you need to beat a pair of Queens but you only have 1 King in your hand, you can play the King and 3 together to create a pair of Kings. A pair of Kings beats a pair of Queens. If you have a pair of threes in your hand but you don't have any twos, you can clear the table with the threes. Then, try to get rid of the lowest card or cards in your hand to start gameplay again."
