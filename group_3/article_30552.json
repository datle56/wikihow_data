If you’re a man, a waist circumference over 40 inches puts you at a higher risk of developing obesity-related health conditions, such as diabetes, heart attack, or stroke. If you’re a woman and aren’t pregnant, a waist circumference over 35 inches is considered high risk. [6] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Medical School Harvard Medical School's Educational Site for the Public Go to source For men, a measurement of 37.1 to 39.9 inches is considered intermediate risk. For women, intermediate risk is between 31.6 to 34.9 inches. If you’re measuring in centimeters, 94 to 101 cm indicates an intermediate risk for men, and a measurement above 102 cm is high risk. For women, 80 to 87 cm is intermediate risk, and circumferences above 88 cm are considered high risk.

Wrap the measuring tape around the widest part of your hips. This is usually around where your thighs meet your hips and the lower part of your hip bones point out to your sides.

Taking your measurements twice will help you ensure they’re accurate.

It doesn’t matter if you’re measuring in inches or centimeters, as long as both waist and hip measurements use the same unit. For men, a ratio higher than 0.95 indicates an increased risk of health issues. For women, increased risk starts at a ratio of 0.85. [12] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Medical School Harvard Medical School's Educational Site for the Public Go to source For example, if you’re a man with a waist circumference of 36 inches (91 cm) and a hip circumference of 40 inches (100 cm), your ratio is 0.9, which is just below the increased risk benchmark."
