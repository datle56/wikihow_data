Every dare should be safe, fun, and harmless. If you accept and complete the dare, you will remain in the game. You and your friends can come up with dares in a variety of ways: The entire group, excluding the person who said “21,” can settle on dare. Individual players can come up with a dare for the person who said “21.” Use an app or website to randomly generate dares. Before starting the game, everyone can write dares down on separate slips of paper. Fold these pieces of paper in half and then put them in a bowl or a hat. When a person is forced to say “21,” they pick a random dare out of the container. [2] X Research source"
