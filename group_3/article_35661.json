      "content": "Keep a food diary for at least 2 weeks. Write down the time, amount, and type of food that you eat each day. This allows you to clearly see exactly what you're eating so you can later determine what foods are causing the acidity in your mouth. [2] X Trustworthy Source FamilyDoctor.org Family-focused medical advice site run by the American Academy of Family Doctors Go to source Write down the food you eat in your food diary as you go, rather than waiting until the end of the day. It's possible you could forget something if you wait until later, and then your food diary won't be as accurate. You might want to download a smartphone app to help keep your food diary, especially if you normally have your smartphone with you — that way, you won't forget to write things down as soon as you eat them. Some of these apps are free, while others require a monthly subscription."

      "content": "Label foods you eat regularly that are highly acidic. You can find lists of the acid contents of foods online and compare them to the foods you've written in your food diary. As a general rule, foods and drinks that are sour, citrus or citrus-flavored, or carbonated are typically acidic. [3] X Research source Soft drinks, even those that are \"diet\" or \"sugar-free,\" are still highly acidic because of the carbonation. Processed sugary foods as well as high-glycemic foods, such as white bread, doughnuts, and potatoes, are also very acidic. Tomatoes, dried fruits, and citrus fruits are highly acidic. However, the acidity typically isn't as much of a problem if you eat them as part of a balanced meal, rather than by themselves. Whole foods are better to eat than processed foods because acids are frequently added to processed foods. This can make a food acidic that normally wouldn't be. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Limit consumption of acidic foods and beverages. Some acidic foods are healthy and include nutrients your body needs. However, you can still reduce your consumption and get your vitamins and minerals from other, less-acidic sources. [5] X Research source Generally, it's a good idea to eliminate soft drinks from your diet completely. They don't have any nutritional value, have a dehydrating effect, and also increase the level of acid in your mouth. Sour candies can be as acidic as battery acid and can cause significant erosion to the enamel of your teeth over time. Even if you enjoy the flavor, try to eat them only rarely. Even though drinking water with lemon has health benefits, it can increase the acidity in your mouth and damage tooth enamel."

Show them your food diary so they can identify foods that might be causing you problems.

Follow any advice from your dentist to keep your mouth in its best health."

      "title": "Consume acidic foods with whole meals.",
      "content": "Consume acidic foods with whole meals. If you eat acidic foods as part of a meal, instead of by themselves, less-acidic foods can help neutralize the acid. Additionally, eating acidic foods in conjunction with others ensures that less acid remains in your mouth after you're done eating. [8] X Research source For example, if you like tomatoes (which are acidic), you might add them to a salad that included greens and cheese to balance out the acid. Bananas, bread, avocado, and broccoli are also low-acidic foods that can balance out the acid in more acidic foods such as tomatoes, berries, and citrus fruits. Avoid holding acidic foods or beverages in your mouth longer than necessary. Simply swallow a drink rather than swishing it around in your mouth. Because milk and other dairy products have a neutral pH, they can help neutralize any acids in other foods and drinks you might be consuming at the same time.

      "content": "Chew sugarless gum to keep up a healthy flow of saliva. Chewing gum increases your production of saliva, which will naturally neutralize and wash away acids in your mouth. However, since sugar can also damage your teeth, choose a sugar-free variety. [10] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Some gums are recommended by dental associations, such as the ADA (American Dental Association). Look on the package for a seal of approval. If you're taking medication for acid reflux or other stomach problems, you may also have dry mouth, which can contribute to mouth acidity since you aren't producing enough saliva to wash away the acids in your mouth.

Right when you wake up and before you eat, take 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of the oil and slowly swish it around in your mouth. Work the oil between your teeth for 15–20 minutes. Spit the oil into a trash can and rinse your mouth out with clean water or a saline solution.

      "content": "Wait an hour after eating acidic foods to brush your teeth. Generally, your saliva will wash away much of the acids in your mouth after you've eaten acidic foods as well as re-harden the enamel on your teeth. Brushing your teeth will help remove the acid that your saliva may have missed. Use a soft-bristled toothbrush to avoid causing further damage to your enamel. Avoid abrasive kinds of toothpaste, including charcoal toothpaste and whitening toothpaste, which can also damage your enamel. It's also a good idea to rinse with a fluoride mouth wash before brushing your teeth to neutralize the acid in your mouth. This keeps the acid from causing further damage to your teeth as you brush.

Since they're used in pools, restaurants, and other settings, you can find them in a variety of department and discount stores. [14] X Research source Test strips come in different ranges of measurement. However, since you're testing your mouth acidity, you don't have to be too worried about the upper ranges. As long as the strips test a pH from 0 to 7.5 or 9 they'll work for your purposes."

If you spit on a saucer or small cup several times, you should have enough for your sample.
