Keep all of the food tokens in one pile and then make another pile for the eggs near the middle of the table. [1] X Research source Even though the eggs have different colors, they are all worth the same amount of points.

Choose the green side to score goals based on who has earned the majority of them. Pick the blue side to score points for each time you achieved the round’s goal. Take 4 of the goal tiles at random and put one into each slot on the goal board for each round. What you need for each goal will differ from round to round, but it’s usually based on the number of birds or eggs in a specific row of your player board. Check the appendix in the game box for a thorough description of each goal tile."
