    {
      "title": "Choose where your Clan lives.",
      "content": "Choose where your Clan lives. For example, RiverClan live near the water, and ShadowClan live in a dark forest. This aspect can drastically change a fanmade Clan. There are many different habitats to choose from, including: Forest Savanna Moor Plains Jungle Mountains Desert Taiga Swamp Mesa Oak forest"
    },
    {
      "title": "Choose a name for your Clan.",
      "content": "Choose a name for your Clan. This is arguably one of its most notable features. The name of a Clan is usually named after the area they live in, as shown in the first step. For example, if you have a Clan in the desert, don't name them SnowClan! Better substitutes would include SandClan, DryClan, OasisClan, SunClan and CactusClan. If your cats live in the swamps, good names would be MarshClan, BogClan, MorassClan, WetClan, MossClan and so on. Be creative!"
    },
    {
      "title": "Decide on the usual features of your Clan.",
      "content": "Decide on the usual features of your Clan. Through selective breeding, the canon Clans have adapted to their environments. For example, WindClan cats are fast for running through open terrain and SkyClan cats can leap high into the trees and have hard pads for walking in rocky areas. Maybe SandClan would have short fur and large ears because of the heat of the desert, and MarshClan would have large, paddle-like paws to swim through the swamps."

      "title": "Draw a map or write a detailed description of your Clan's territory.",
      "content": "Draw a map or write a detailed description of your Clan's territory. If you draw, it doesn't have to be of good quality as long as you can understand it. This will help as reference in your fanfiction. While drawing, ask yourself questions such as: Where is the camp? Where do the apprentices train? Where do they hunt? Where do they drink? Are there any borders with rival Clans?"
    },
    {
      "title": "Draw or write a detailed description of your Clan's camp.",
      "content": "Draw or write a detailed description of your Clan's camp. The camp is where a lot of the story will take place. Again, ask yourself questions like: Where does the leader sleep, and where do they address the Clan? Where do the warriors and deputy sleep? Where does the medicine cat sleep? How do they store their herbs? Where do the apprentices sleep? Where do the kits and queens sleep? Where do the elders sleep? Where do they store prey? Where is the entrance? Are there multiple? How is the camp protected?"
    },
    {
      "title": "Make an allegiance list for your Clan.",
      "content": "Make an allegiance list for your Clan. All allegiances have one leader, one deputy, one to three medicine cats, and a selection of warriors, apprentices, elders, queens and kits. Keep in mind that warriors make up the bulk of the Clan. You can add made up roles if you wish. This will also make the Clan more interesting! If you are struggling, use an OC generator."

    {
      "title": "Create a story involving your Clan(s).",
      "content": "Create a story involving your Clan(s). It can be anything, from a fire to a traitor. Helpful questions to ask yourself while preparing and writing your story are: Who is the main character, and who are their family and friends? What motivates them? What is their personality like? Who is the villain? What are their motives to do what they do? Do they kill, manipulate, steal, or all three? What happens at the climax? This part has lots of action and usually is when the main character confronts an enemy, but it's your choice! Does anyone die in the story? How do they die? How does their death affect others? Does the Clan feel sad, relieved, or angry? Do they go to StarClan or the Dark Forest, or become a ghost? What do you want to happen at the end? What do you want your main character to achieve?"
