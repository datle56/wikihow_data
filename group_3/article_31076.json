      "content": "Fearless, borderline blind, and able to fight through venom There’s an iconic meme that explains why honey badgers “don’t give a s*it” and we’ve got to say we agree with the meme’s assessment. Honey badgers only attack when they’re surprised, but they have absolutely terrible eyesight which means they’re basically surprised by everything all the time. They snack almost exclusively on things that are venomous or dangerous (including adders, vipers, cobras, and beehives), and they’re so angry that venom coursing through their bloodstream won’t stop an attack. [1] X Research source They’re so angry that even lions avoid them, and some theorize that cheetah cubs evolved to look like honey badgers so they’d be left alone! [2] X Research source Anger level: 10/10. This animal is rage incarnate. Danger level: 10/10 for other animals. 0/10 for humans. They’re too confused by humans to want to attack them. Overall aggression score: 7.5/10."

Lions, elephants, great white sharks—none of these alphas look for pointless scraps. Not the Nile crocodile. These giant beasts are apex predators, but they don’t care; they’ll still attack basically anything that enters their territory. On top of that, the bigger these guys get the angrier they become. They must be hungry all the time or something. [3] X Trustworthy Source Science Direct Online archive of peer-reviewed research on scientific, technical and medical topics Go to source Anger level: 6/10. They’re pretty chill if nothing bothers them. Danger level: 8/10. They kill around 200 people a year and it’s super easy to accidentally wander into their territory since they spend so much time under water. Overall aggression score: 7/10."

      "content": "Dedicated, formidable, and armed with sharp horns African buffalo are actually 4 different species of buffalo, but all of them are equally aggressive. They evolved to stand up to hippos, lions, and other giant beasts, so they’re huge and extremely defensive. With the loss of their habitat, they’ve also learned how to break down fences to eat crops and farm plants. They’re colossal beasts with massive horns and they aren’t afraid to headbutt literally anything that interrupts their meal. [4] X Research source Anger level: 4/10. Just let ‘em eat and they should be chill. Danger level: 8/10. African buffalo kill around 200 people a year. Overall aggression score: 6/10"

      "content": "So nervous they’re putting the “danger” in endangered Black Rhinos are critically endangered, but they do pack a serious punch if you run into one. They can run up to 35 miles per hour (56 km/h) and they weigh anywhere from 1,700–3,000 pounds (770–1,360 kg), so all they need to do is run at something to kill it. Like the honey badger, black rhinos have basically zero eyesight, so they’re frequently confused and startled. In fact, rhinos are basically nervous all the time. They’d probably be a lot friendlier if someone got them some glasses. [5] X Research source Anger level: 4/10. Their anger comes from a place of confusion and nerves, so we don’t feel comfortable ranking them especially high here. Danger level: 10/10. If it runs at you you’re dead, so yeah. Pretty dangerous. Overall aggression score: 7/10."

      "content": "Angry cannibals with serious anxiety issues Bull sharks are cannibalistic, which means they eat their own (in addition to other sharks). This means that from the moment a bull shark is born, they’re being attacked by something bigger than them. Not exactly a good strategy for raising a calm critter. As a result, bull sharks are extremely territorial and willing to fight anything—even if it’s bigger than them. [6] X Research source Anger level: 10/10. They’re raised to be pure rage. Danger level: 10/10. Unfortunately, these sharks naturally frequent temperate coastal waters. This means they run into swimmers very often. They attack around 100 people a year and kill about 30% of the time. If you hear of a shark eating a person, it was probably a bull shark. [7] X Research source Overall aggression score: 10/10."

[8] X Research source It does make this list for being so dangerous and fast to fight, though. The massive black mamba is actually the fastest snake in the world (they’re faster than Komodo dragons!). On top of that, they can swim on top of water and throw up to 50% of their body weight in the air to strike their target. No snake should be able to jump—especially the snake with one of the deadliest bites in the world. [9] X Research source Anger level: 2/10. The black mamba actually doesn’t want to fight a lot of the time. It just has an aggressive reputation because it’s so fast when it does fight. Danger level: 10/10. Their bite isn’t called the “kiss of death” for no reason. The black mamba is responsible for hundreds (potentially thousands) of deaths a year. Overall aggression score: 6/10"

These large fish have huge territories when they’re nesting and they’ll attack anything that enters their territory—including divers. The triggerfish will also follow whatever it attacks until it completely leaves the area, so not only does the fish bite you, it bites you then chases you down like a psychopath. [10] X Research source Anger level: 7/10. It even has a special spine and fin that pop out when it’s about to attack. That’s right. The fish has a special attack mode. Danger level: 3/10. The bite hurts, but they aren’t big enough to cause permanent damage of any kind. [11] X Research source Overall aggression score: 5/10"

In fact, it actually eats a lot of its prey whole—and boy does it have a lot of prey. Birds, insects, rodents, lizards—South American horned frogs will eat it all. It also has a bite that’s about twice as strong as an English Bulldog’s bite, so keep your fingers away if you run into one of these frogs. [12] X Research source Anger level: 2/10. It’s got the attitude of a typical frog, it mainly just wants to sit on a lily and chill. Danger level: 6/10. That bite will take a finger off! Luckily, it’s pretty easy to avoid these frogs.

If they detect a threat, they’ll band together and thousands of ants will all simultaneously descend on the target. Unfortunately, ants aren’t especially good at detecting threats, so they’ll swarm basically anything that annoys them. They also have an extremely painful bite that can kill you if you don’t flee. [13] X Research source Anger level: 9/10. They get a point off for being the “too dumb to assess threats correctly” kind of angry instead of the “raw ire for all living things” angry.

      "content": "The best defense is no defense at all—just attack everything Hippos are almost comically aggressive for two reasons: they have no way to defend themselves, and they’re extremely territorial. That means that if a hippo feels threatened, they charge. It doesn’t matter how big or scary the intruder is, the hippo has no choice but to fight. They’re also crazy fast (they run up to 30 miles per hour (48 km/h)) and they weight up to 10,000 pounds (4,500 kg), so they can basically run over anything that isn’t an elephant. Anger level: 10/10. They’re extremely angry. You would be too if you were stuck in a mud pond all day. Danger level: 10/10.

So it’s no surprise that our closest living relative is also extremely violent and aggressive. These brilliant primates are comparable to people in the sense that they can fight, kill, and harass one another if they’re angry enough. [14] X Research source Anger level: 5/10. It’s hard to assess because every chimp has its own personality, but some chimps want to fight all the time while others basically do everything in their power to avoid conflict. Danger level: 6/10.

As a consequence, the only other animals polar bears encounter are food. With no natural predators or dangers, polar bears will basically attack anything that moves if they’re hungry.

If it’s brown, lie down…if it’s white, good luck.” [15] X Research source Anger level: 6/10. They get a few points off because their anger is primarily hunger-based. Danger level: 10/10.

However, that can change pretty fast if the wolverine’s territory is infringed upon by other critters (including people if you don’t leave them alone). They can also get very aggressive if they’re hungry, which happens pretty often, given the fact that they’ve evolved to be scavengers in climates where scavenging is pretty tough. [16] X Research source Anger level: 4/10. The conditions have to be right for a wolverine to get angry. Danger level: 2/10. Wolverine attacks on people are very rare.
