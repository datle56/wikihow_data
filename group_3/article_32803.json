      "content": "Maroon Maroon is a verb that means stranding a sailor on an island without any provisions or help. Marooning was a punishment ship captains often gave to law-breakers and deserters.

      "title": "Dead men tell no tales",
      "content": "Dead men tell no tales Thanks to Disney’s popular Pirates of the Caribbean franchise, you’ve probably heard this pirate threat before. It’s a way of reminding a captive or witness that you can kill them so they don’t rat you out or spill a precious secret.

      "title": "Dance the hempen jig",
      "content": "Dance the hempen jig If a pirate has danced the hempen jig, it’s a euphemism meaning they were executed by hanging.

      "title": "Scurvy",
      "content": "Scurvy Scurvy is an adjective for someone a pirate finds horrendous. Pair this insult with a noun like “dog,” “scoundrel,” or “villain” to really cut someone down.

    {
      "title": "Nightingale",
      "content": "Nightingale When a pirate cried out while being flogged, or whipped, as punishment for some act, bystanders insulted him by calling him a “nightingale” in reference to the singing bird. This is because pirates see such crying as cowardly and pathetic—the opposite of what a swashbuckler should be. It’s similar to the modern insult “crybaby,” but more specific. [36] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Kick the bucket",
      "content": "Kick the bucket “Kick the bucket” is yet another pirate euphemism for being hanged.

    },
    {
      "title": "Swing the lead",
      "content": "Swing the lead Like swabbing the deck, swinging the lead was another job that became an insult. When pirates were measuring the depth below the boat while near land, they’d use a line with a lead weight at the bottom to do so. Because this task was easy, it became an insult to say someone swings the lead—it means they’re lazy or not doing their share. [38] X Research source"

      "title": "Sea dog",
      "content": "Sea dog A sea dog isn’t a furry animal that lives on a pirate ship. Rather, it’s a pirate term for a sailor who’s been at sea for a long time and is a wizened veteran of the trade.

    {
      "title": "Son of a biscuit eater",
      "content": "Son of a biscuit eater While there are plenty of scathing pirate insults, “son of a biscuit eater” is somewhat sillier than the rest. As you can probably guess, it’s a censored version of a more common curse. [40] X Research source The logic is that a biscuit eater is too refined and delicate to be a rough-and-tumble pirate. [41] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Scallywag",
      "content": "Scallywag Scallywag is fun to say, making it one of the most popular pirate sayings remembered today. It’s a word used by experienced pirates to refer to people new to the trade. [42] X Research source Think of it as the pirate version of a “noob” or someone who’s “green.” It’s not necessarily an insult, just a way for veteran pirates to distinguish themselves from newbies."

      "title": "Me hearties",
      "content": "Me hearties Some pirate slang sounds too cute to be associated with brash and rugged pirates—“Me hearties” is the perfect example. “Hearties” are friends or comrades, while “me” is the pirate way of saying “my.” Say “me hearties” to refer to your crew. [43] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Freeze the balls off a brass monkey",
      "content": "Freeze the balls off a brass monkey This pirate saying sounds dirtier than it actually is. On a pirate ship, the “monkey” was a brass tray that held cannonballs. In cold weather, the iron cannonballs shifted and fell as they reacted with the metal of the tray. It’s a fancy way of saying it’s really cold. [45] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Chockablock",
      "content": "Chockablock When the pirate ship is very full of people, the crew may describe it as “chockablock.” The name comes from two objects on a pirate ship. A chock is a wedge that keeps an object from moving as the boat rocks on the waves. A block is a pulley used to hoist and haul the sail. When pulled to the extreme, it gets stuck and is considered “chockablock”—as if a chock is stopping the blocks. [49] X Research source"

      "title": "Cackle fruit",
      "content": "Cackle fruit Cackle fruit is the pirate name for hen’s eggs. [50] X Research source You might also hear the term cackleberry, which has the same meaning. A cackle is a kind of shrill laugh—like the sound chickens make—and the fruit part suggests the egg is the “fruit” or product of the cackling bird. [51] X Research source"

      "title": "Scuttlebutt",
      "content": "Scuttlebutt Pirates didn’t ask each other for the tea—they called gossip scuttlebutt. The term gets its own song in The Little Mermaid (2023). [52] X Research source On a pirate ship, the scuttlebutt was a cask containing fresh water. It’s like the water cooler of modern-day offices: a site where coworkers gather to gossip and hydrate at the same time. [53] X Research source"

      "content": "Go overboard with exaggeration. Pirates are colorful characters, known for reacting to life with loud, brash expressions. Don’t be afraid to let your passion for the sea, your mateys, and your grog shine through as you talk like a pirate . Use your hands to be more expressive, and practice a full, throaty laugh befitting of a sea dog. Exaggerate your body language to better embody a character impression, confirms actress Murisa Harba. “Physicality is the number one way that we as human beings communicate to one another,” she explains."
