      "content": "An oldhead is someone from an older generation. Generally, the word refers to someone who’s older than you. How much older? It’s flexible, and up for interpretation. Usually, though, an oldhead is a mentor or leader figure, someone with experience to share. They’ve been around a while, and they know a thing or two. [1] X Research source Some people consider the term negative or derogatory, but it can also be used endearingly to pay respects to your elders. Example: “Steve over there is an oldhead, he’s been working here since anyone can remember.” Example: “She’s a neighborhood oldhead who’s lived here since before we had street signs.” People sometimes say that someone has “an old head on young shoulders” to say that a young person has more experience or wisdom than their age would suggest."

      "content": "An oldhead is a veteran or older fan of something. Often, “oldhead” is used to talk about people with more experience when it comes to certain interests, activities, or hobbies. Particularly, it’s used to talk about sports or music fans, especially hip hop enthusiasts, but can be used to talk about older fans of pretty much anything. Again, it can be either derogatory or endearing, depending on how it’s used. [2] X Research source Example: “Mike’s a real rap oldhead. He put out some records himself when he was young.” Example: “She’s always talking about how the game has changed over the years, like some sort of oldhead.”"

      "content": "Oldhead can be affectionate or insulting, depending on how you use it. Just like making any sort of comment on someone’s age can be a little risky, using “oldhead” can be tricky to do without insulting someone. If you’re expressing admiration for an older generation, then it’s usually okay. If you’re complaining about them, though, then it’s probably more of an insult. Affectionate: “These oldheads are built different. They grew up doing things the hard way, so they’re tough.” Insulting: “These oldheads always want to do things their way, even though their way is so outdated."

In Baltimore, an oldhead is sometimes someone who no longer goes out to experience night life, usually due to their age."
