      "content": "This classic adjective lets someone know they’re looking good. “Lindo” directly translates to cute, making it the perfect option for some casual flirting. Worried about coming on too strongly? “Lindo” is definitely your best bet. [1] X Research source In Spanish, many words are categorized as either feminine or masculine, with each form having a slightly different spelling. For instance, “lindo” is the masculine form of the word and ends in “o”—you’d use this form of the word to flirt with a guy. If you were flirting with a woman, you’d use “linda” (LEEN-dah), which is the feminine form of the word (ending in “a”). “¡Tu eres super linda!” (Tu air-es SOO-per LEEN-dah) means “You’re super cute!”"

      "content": "Call someone “cute” or “sweet” with the word “tierno.” Looking for a good way to strike up a conversation? “Tierno” is a great way to make the first move and let someone know that you really like them. Although “tierno” can also mean “tender,” plenty of people also use this word in flirty, romantic situations. “Tierno” is the masculine form of the word. It switches to “tierna” (tee-ERR-nah) when you’re speaking with a woman. “¡Creo que eres tierno!” (CREH-oh kay air-es tee-ERR no) means “I think you’re sweet.”"

[4] X Research source “Precioso” changes to “preciosa” (preh-see-OH-sa) when you’re talking to a woman (or are referencing a feminine noun). “Tu eres precioso.” (Too air-es preh-see-OH-so): “You are charming.” “Mi sobrina es una bebé preciosa” (Mi so-BREE-na es oon-uh beh-beh preh-see-OH-sa) means “My niece is a beautiful baby.”"

[5] X Research source “Monada” is the only form of this word—you don’t change it to “monado” for masculine nouns. “¡Hola, monada!” (OH-lah moh-NAH-da): “Hello, beautiful!” “¡Qué monada de gatita!” (Kay moh-NAH-da day gah-TEE-tah) means “What a cute little cat!”"

      "content": "This flirtatious word lets someone know that they’re looking sharp. [6] X Research source Although it technically means “beautiful” rather than “cute,” “bello” can be used interchangeably with words that directly translate to “cute,” like “lindo.” As an adjective, “bello” falls into the masculine and feminine adjective rule. Stick with “bello” when you’re flirting with a cute guy, and opt for “bella” (BEH-yah) when speaking with a cute girl. “Eres tan bella que me has hecho olvidar mi piropo” (Air-es tan BEH-yah kay meh yas ay-cho ol-vee-dar me pee-ROH-po) means “You’re so beautiful that you made me forget my pick-up line.”"

[7] X Research source To keep your flirty comment grammatically correct, use “hermosa” (err-MOH-sa) when you’re complimenting a girl and “hermoso” when you’re chatting with a guy. “Tu eres hermoso” (Too air-es err-MOH-so) means “You are so beautiful.”"

      "title": "This Spanish word can translate to “good-looking.”",
      "content": "This Spanish word can translate to “good-looking.” While “bueno” officially means “good” or “nice,” it can also mean “good-looking” or “attractive” in the right context. [8] X Research source It doesn’t technically mean “cute,” but it can still be a charming way to flirt and let someone know that you’re interested in them. As an adjective, “bueno” is used to modify male nouns. With feminine nouns, “buena” (BWE-nah) is used instead. “Ella está buena” (Ey-ya es-tah BWE-nah) means “She is looking good.” To really dial up your flirting, use a superlative like “buenísima” (BWE-nee-see-mah), which means “very good-looking”). For instance, you could say “Tu eres buenísima” (Too air-es BWE-nee-see-mah), which means “You are very good-looking.”"

      "content": "This is identical to the English word “attractive.” You’ve hit things off with that special someone but aren’t quite sure how to take your convo to the next level. “Atractivo” could be the word you’re looking for—it literally means “attractive” in English, and is a great way to flirtatiously tell someone that they’re looking good. [10] X Research source If you’re flirting with a guy, use “atractivo,” which is the male form of the word. If you’re chatting it up with a woman, use “atractiva” (uh-track-TEE-vah), the female form of the word, instead. “Lucas, eres un hombre muy atractivo” (LOO-cuss, air-es oon OHM-bray MOY uh-track-TEE-voh) means “Lucas, you are a very attractive man.”"
