      "content": "Silicone sealant, a caulk gun, and masking tape are essential. Before you start building your aquarium, gather your supplies and keep them near your glass. You can also grab a few large containers or heavy objects for holding up the glass while you assemble it. [1] X Research source Many people say that \"aquarium silicone sealant\" is the only sealant you should consider. Although it's rather expensive, it is a good choice because it doesn’t have any anti-mildew chemicals that can be toxic to fish over time. Regular household silicone like GE Door & Window clear silicone, Dow-Corning \"DAP\", and Napa All-Glass 100% clear silicone are also viable options."

      "content": "Use acrylic or plexiglass for smaller tanks. If you’re going for a tank smaller than 25 gallons, plexiglass is your best option. It’s flexible, fairly cheap, and you can find it at most hardware stores. However, keep in mind that plexiglass is prone to staining, so it might not be the best choice if you plan to use a lot of chemicals in your water. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Use stained glass or non-tempered glass for larger tanks.",
      "content": "Use stained glass or non-tempered glass for larger tanks. Anything above 25 gallons needs something a bit stronger. Stained glass and non-tempered glass isn’t as flexible as plexiglass or acrylic, but it’s thick and it doesn’t scratch easily. It also holds up well over time, so you probably won’t have to replace it in the near future. You can find both kinds of glass at most hardware stores. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Err on the thicker side if you’re filling the aquarium with water. Water is heavy, and it can add a lot of pressure on your aquarium glass. If you're keeping it empty, even up to 14 in (36 cm) could be fine with 1 ⁄ 4 inch (0.6 cm) thick glass. Here are the general guidelines: [4] X Research source Aquarium Height / Sheet Thickness 1 to 12 inches (2.5 to 30.5 cm) / 1 ⁄ 4 in (0.64 cm) 12–18 inches (30.5–45.7 cm) / 3 ⁄ 8 in (0.95 cm) 18–24 inches (45.7–61.0 cm) / 1 ⁄ 2 in (1.3 cm) 24–30 inches (61.0–76.2 cm) / 3 ⁄ 4 inch (1.9 cm)"

If you aren’t sure which size you should make, ask the fish expert at your local pet store. [6] X Research source If you're placing water into the tank, remember that water is very heavy—about 10 pounds per gallon. You may want to go on the smaller side just to keep it more portable.

Try to keep the silicone about 2 millimetres (0.079 in) away from the edge as you go. Be sure to work quickly, as silicone sets in 2 to 3 minutes. [10] X Research source"

Hold it there briefly, adhere the rest of the tape up the sides, and it should stay up.

Whatever you use, 2–3 inches (5.1–7.6 cm) should be plenty. If you choose gravel, give it a quick rinse before you put it into your aquarium to avoid dust in your water."

Everything will be easier to place (and it will stay in place) if you work with a few inches of water in your aquarium. You can place plastic decorations, live plants, or rocks to decorate the area. Once you have the terrain all set up, fill the aquarium all of the way up with water. Leave a gap of about 1 in (2.5 cm) from the water to the top of the aquarium."

      "content": "Yes, you need a dechlorinator for freshwater fish. Tap water has a lot of chemicals in it, which can really harm your fish. Buy a package of dechlorinator and read the instructions on the back to find out the right amount for your size tank. Sprinkle the dechlorinator in and cycle the water through. [15] X Expert Source Aaron Bernard Fish & Aquarium Specialist Expert Interview. 17 July 2020. You may also want to use a bacterial catalyst like SafeStart, which will speed up the growth of good bacteria in your aquarium. Once that's in, you'll need to do a fishless cycle to monitor the water parameters (pH, High pH, Ammonia, Nitrite, and Nitrate). Get an aquarium testing kit and wait for the numbers to spike and lower to 0. When this happens, it's time to add your fish."
