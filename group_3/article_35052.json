In 2022, the Squishmallows brand revealed a 6-tier rarity scale that would appear on the plushies’ tags to note special limited edition Squishmallows. Squishmallows with a rarity label have a maximum number of units that will be manufactured before the design is retired. Here are the tiers of the rarity scale: [17] X Research source Rare: Rare Squishmallows have a silver tag and have a maximum of 75,000 available worldwide. Ultra Rare: Ultra Rare Squishmallows have a golden tag and a maximum of 50,000 units. Special Edition: Special Edition Squishmallows have a holographic tag and a maximum of 20,000 units. Select Series: Select Series Squishmallows have a black tag and are exclusively available on the Squishmallows website. There are typically no more than 5,000-10,000 units available, though some designs are even more limited. Check-In Series: Check-In Series Squishmallows have a purple tag and are exclusive to special locations or events. The number produced depends on the event. Founder’s Edition: Founder’s Edition Squishmallows are only obtainable by redeeming the rare Founder’s Redemption Card found in Squishmallows trading card packs.

In general, these Squishmallows will have some indication on their tag that they’re limited edition. Here are some examples: [18] X Research source First to Market: First to Market Squishmallows have a special First to Market badge on their tag to indicate they’re one of the first 5,000 of the design to be produced. Note that not all first edition Squishmallows will feature this badge. Holiday special editions: Holiday Squishmallows are only available for a limited time around the holiday they’re themed around, like Halloween or Christmas. While it’s usually obvious by the plushie’s design if it’s holiday-themed, their tags may also indicate that they’re limited edition. Retailer exclusive: Retailer exclusive Squishmallows are only available at a specific retailer, like Walmart or Walgreens. Their tags will typically be printed with the retailer’s logo to indicate that they’re retailer exclusive."

      "content": "Research which designs are popular with collectors. While everyone has their favorite Squishmallows, if a certain design is popular with a wide variety of collectors, odds are the value will go up. When this happens, the Squishmallows will be harder to find and resellers will raise the prices, effectively making them “rare,” even if they weren’t originally. Keep up with different collectors to see which designs are worth buying. Many collectors like to post about their collections on social media. Try searching phrases like “Squishmallow collector” or “Squishmallow collection” on sites like YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, and even Reddit to find the accounts of popular collectors. For example, YouTuber Jess Lavenders has a whole playlist dedicated to Squishmallows on her channel, and YouTube couple ksh1zzle15 have tons of videos about hunting for Squishmallows."

Check online to see if there are any Squishmallow events near you. [19] X Research source To find out about these events, join social media groups on sites like Facebook that are dedicated to trading and selling plushies or Squishmallows specifically.

      "title": "Research retailer-exclusive Squishmallows.",
      "content": "Research retailer-exclusive Squishmallows. Often, Squishmallows are considered rare because they’re only sold at one retailer and each store only receives so many units. If there’s a specific design you’re looking for, make sure you know where to find it and when it will hit shelves. Visit the store as soon as possible to increase your chances of being able to find what you’re looking for. [21] X Research source If you know someone who works at that retailer, ask them if they know if their location will sell the Squishmallows and, if so, if they know when they’ll hit the shelves. This way, you may be able to grab one before others know they’re available. Remember, though, that employees may not know if or when they’ll receive a certain Squishmallow, so be polite and understanding if they can’t give you the answer you’re hoping for. Squishmallows are available at a ton of retailers, but exclusive editions are frequently sold at stores like Target, Walgreens, Claire’s, Books-a-Million, GameStop, Hot Topic, and Walmart.

Lightly dab at the dirty spot until it’s clean, then allow the Squishmallow to air dry.

      "content": "Store them away from sunlight in a cool, dry area. When you’re finished displaying or handling your rare Squishmallows, make sure they’re away from direct sunlight so their color doesn’t fade. For best results, store them in acid-free tissue paper and boxes to help them hold their shape and keep dust away. Avoid plastic bags, as these can trap moisture and lead to mold and mildew. [26] X Research source If you need to stack your Squishmallows, place the larger, sturdier ones on the bottom to avoid squishing the smaller or rarer ones."

      "content": "How can I get a rare Squishmallow without paying a lot? Because resellers often raise the price of rare Squishmallows, it may be difficult to get that exact version without paying a lot. Keep checking online marketplaces and local thrift stores to see if you get lucky. Sometimes smaller versions of a rare Squishmallow aren’t considered rare themselves, so if you’re just after the design, you may be able to find a different size for a more affordable price."

      "title": "Is lack of availability the same as rarity?",
      "content": "Is lack of availability the same as rarity? In general, yes. While some Squishmallows may feature the “Rare” tag, resellers are more interested in popular designs that they know they can resell for a higher price. Because they often buy them all, this leads to a lack of availability, which in turn, increases the design’s rarity, even if it wasn’t originally labeled “Rare.” This is also why some rare Squishmallows may not always be considered rare. It’s all about supply and demand. If no one is interested in buying the Squishmallow, resellers will eventually lower their prices, and soon it will be easy to buy the Squishmallow again."
