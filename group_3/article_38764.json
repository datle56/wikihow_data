Some items, like lithium ion batteries, need to be specially labeled for shipment.

      "content": "Package the item. You can visit a nearby FedEx store or order the appropriate packing supplies online. Generally, you should use a mailing envelope, standard corrugated cardboard box, or shipping tube, all of which are available in a variety of sizes. Use bubble wrap to pad the package, if necessary. [1] X Research source Be sure to securely close the packaging, either with the built-in glue strip (for envelopes), by applying packing tape across all the seams (for boxes), or reinforcing the sealed ends with packing tape (for tubes). It's a good idea to put a copy of the completed shipping label inside the package, if possible."

      "content": "Fill out the shipping label and any other required documents. For a domestic shipping label, you'll need to provide both the sender's and recipient's name, address, and phone number. You'll also need to add a description and value of the item you're sending along with the weight of the package. You can fill out the forms by hand in any FedEx store, or fill them out on the FedEx website and print them out home. [2] X Research source If you're filling out the forms online, be sure you have an accurate scale to weigh the package with. For international packages, you'll need to fill out customs forms that include the export control classification number and the harmonized system code, which can be found using the tool available at https://www.fedex.com/GTM?cntry_code=us ."

      "title": "Place the label on the largest flat side of the container.",
      "content": "Place the label on the largest flat side of the container. Slip the completed label into a clear, plastic pouch and peel off the adhesive backing. Firmly attach the label to the largest flat side of the shipping container, and make sure you don't tape over the label or cover it up in any way. If the package is too small to fit the entire label on 1 side, make sure the recipient's address is on 1 side of the seam and the barcode is on the other. Secure a tie-on tag label to luggage and other containers with handles using a zip-tie."

For more expensive items, you must declare the value and pay $0.90 per $100 of the value for insurance. If you end up needing to file a claim, you must provide proof-of-value for the lost item.
