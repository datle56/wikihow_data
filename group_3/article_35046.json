      "content": "Red, pink, or violet eyes Red, pink, or violet eyes are not caused by pigments in your iris, but by albinism. Albinism is a total or near total lack of melanin, which colors your hair, skin, and eyes. [1] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source When there is no melanin in the eye at all, the iris appears red because the light that hits it is reflecting off of red blood vessels rather than pigment particles. When there is a small amount of pigment (below the levels needed to make a clear blue color), this red light bounces around the melanin particles and may appear violet. [2] X Trustworthy Source Nature Respected Multidisciplinary Scientific Journal Go to source How rare is it? Only about 1 in 20,000 people in the world has albinism, and not all albino people have red or violet eyes. [3] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source It’s hard to estimate an exact percentage of people with this eye color, but some estimate the number is as low as 0.01%. Most albino people actually have incredibly faint blue eyes (though they can be brown or hazel, too). It’s the way the light hits the eye that makes it appear red or violet. Albinism can affect the whole body (oculocutaneous albinism), or it can be localized to only the eyes (ocular albinism). Many genes can affect albinism, but the most prominent is the OCA2 gene (after which oculocutaneous albinism is named)."

      "title": "Green eyes",
      "content": "Green eyes Green is the most rare naturally occurring eye color that’s not due to a special circumstance like albinism. The green color comes from a complex interaction of genes and melanin; green eyes have more melanin than blue eyes, but less than brown. Green-eyed people typically have alleles (alternative forms of genes caused by mutation) that would normally create brown eyes, but with one gene “switched off” that allows the green color to come through. [4] X Trustworthy Source Nature Respected Multidisciplinary Scientific Journal Go to source Other factors, like hints of brown and yellow pigments, also contribute to the overall green color. How rare is it? Only 2% of the global population is estimated to have green eyes. [5] X Research source Green eyes are most common in Central, Western, and Northern Europe. European Americans with recent Celtic or Germanic ancestry make up about 16% of all green-eyed people. The genes responsible for green eyes are also believed to be linked to having red hair."

      "title": "Gray eyes",
      "content": "Gray eyes Gray eyes used to be considered a subset of blue eyes and can come in shades from dark gray to blue-gray to green-gray and more. Gray eyes happen when the front layer of your cornea has very little melanin while the back layer has lots of brown melanin. The thin layer of collagen between these layers may also be slightly thicker in gray-eyed people, which causes a “cloudy” effect that may appear gray, blue, or green. [6] X Research source How rare is it? Only about 3% of the world population has gray eyes, making gray the second rarest naturally occurring eye color. [7] X Research source Gray eyes are most common in Central and South Asia and the Middle East."

      "title": "Amber eyes",
      "content": "Amber eyes Amber-colored eyes are the third rarest in the world after green and gray. They contain more melanin than hazel eyes (which are primarily brown with spots of green, gold, yellow, and/or amber) but less than fully brown eyes. Their rich, golden-yellow tint comes from a yellowish pigment called lipochrome. Unlike hazel eyes, which may appear to shift colors or have flecks in it, amber eyes consist of a single hue. [8] X Research source How rare is it? About 5% of the global population has amber eyes. Amber eyes are most commonly found in Pakistan and the Balkans, but are also present in Europe (especially southern France, Italy, and the Iberian Peninsula), the Middle East, and the “southern cone” region of South America."

      "title": "Hazel eyes",
      "content": "Hazel eyes Hazel eyes can be brown- or green-dominant, with brown-dominant eyes being the most common. The iris displays flecks of green, lighter brown, or gold, giving hazel eyes their characteristic complexity and ability to “change colors” with the light (the eye doesn’t really change color, but onlookers see it differently based on how the light hits it). Hazel eyes are a dominant trait, like brown eyes, so if one parent has them, it’s highly likely their child will as well. [9] X Research source How rare is it? About 5% or more of people have hazel eyes, making them just barely more common than amber eyes. [10] X Research source Hazel eyes are most common in the Middle East, North Africa, Brazil, and in people of Spanish ancestry."

      "title": "Blue eyes",
      "content": "Blue eyes Blue is the second most common eye color. Blue eyes can range from dark to light and are caused by a lack of melanin in the front layer of the iris (the back layer is brown with melanin). This means that longer, darker light waves are absorbed by the eye while shorter, lighter waves are reflected back, giving the iris a blue color. [11] X Research source How rare is it? About 8 to 10% of the world population has blue eyes. [12] X Research source Blue eyes are most common in Northern and Eastern Europe (especially in the Baltics). However, they can also be found in other places like North Africa and Central, South, or West Asia. Did you know? It’s believed that all blue-eyed people have a common ancestor. Scientists speculate that a genetic mutation occurred in the people of northern Europe and Scandinavia about 6,000 to 10,000 years ago, and all blue-eyed people are (very distantly) descended from the first person to have this mutation.

      "title": "Brown eyes",
      "content": "Brown eyes Brown eyes are by far the most common eye color on the planet. They occur when both layers of the iris and the stroma between them contain melanin, which can absorb both long and short wavelengths of light. Basically, the more melanin you have, the browner your eyes are. [14] X Research source How rare is it? Up to 80% of all people worldwide have brown eyes, making it overwhelmingly the most common eye color. Brown eyes are found all over the world. Darker brown eyes are common to Africa, East Asia, and South Asia, while lighter brown eyes can be found in Europe, West Asia, and the Americas. It’s believed that almost all humans had brown eyes up until 6,000 to 10,000 years ago, when the first blue-eyed mutation is thought to have occurred."

      "title": "Melanin levels",
      "content": "Melanin levels The amount of melanin in your iris (especially in the front layer) ultimately dictates what color your eyes will be. Lots of melanin leads to a darker, richer brown color on one end of the spectrum, while very little melanin causes light blue or gray eyes on the other end. [15] X Trustworthy Source MedlinePlus Collection of medical information sourced from the US National Library of Medicine Go to source The iris is the circular muscle that wraps around your pupil, or the dark circle in the center of your eye. When it contracts, it partially closes the pupil and limits how much light can enter your eye."

      "title": "Genetics",
      "content": "Genetics Scientists used to believe that a single gene controlled your eye color (maybe you remember learning about dominant and recessive alleles in biology that cause brown or blue eyes, respectively). However, new research shows it’s more complicated than that. Today, it’s estimated that there are about 16 genes that can influence your eye color. [16] X Trustworthy Source MedlinePlus Collection of medical information sourced from the US National Library of Medicine Go to source The OCA2 and HERC2 genes are the most important to eye color. OCA2 creates a protein that helps make and store melanin, and HERC2 controls whether the OCA2 gene is “on” or “off.” When HERC2 turns OCA2 off, there is less melanin in the eyes and the color is lighter. Other genes play smaller roles in eye color. These include the SIP, IRF4, SLC24A4, SLC24A5, SLC45A2, TPCN2, TYR, and TYRP1 genes. All these interacting genes mean that a baby’s eye color can’t be 100% accurately assumed based on the parents’ eye colors alone."

      "content": "Other eye conditions In rare cases, a genetic condition, illness, or injury can affect the color of one or both of your eyes. These may include specific conditions like: Heterochromia: People with heterochromia have eyes that are different colors because one eye produces more melanin than the other. This can be genetic or caused by an injury, surgery, illness like diabetes or glaucoma, or certain medications (like those that treat glaucoma). [17] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Only about 1% of humans have this condition, but it’s more common in animals. Anisocoria: This condition causes the pupils to be different sizes, which can make one eye appear darker than the other (especially if the iris is dark brown). Some may be born with anisocoria, but it’s more often a suddenly occurring symptom of a larger health problem or injury. About 15% of people experience anisocoria at one point in their lives.

      "content": "People with light eyes may have more health risks. The differences are pretty minimal, but studies show minor pros and cons to having dark or light eyes. People with light colored eyes (like blue, gray, or red) may be more likely to abuse alcohol, suffer from light sensitivity (especially those with albinism), or develop conditions like macular degeneration (a loss of your central field of vision) or ocular melanoma (eye cancer). [19] X Research source Dark eyes, however, seem more resilient. People with dark eyes may be more resistant to age-related hearing loss, are less sensitive to light, and have a lower risk of macular degeneration or melanoma. [20] X Research source Light eyes aren’t all bad, though. Other studies show that women with blue eyes may have a higher pain tolerance during childbirth than dark-eyed women. [21] X Research source Light-eyed people also have a decreased risk of vitiligo (a skin condition where patches of skin lose their pigment). [22] X Research source"
