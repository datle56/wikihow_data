      "title": "“Per your request” confirms you’ve completed a requested task.",
      "content": "“Per your request” confirms you’ve completed a requested task. It’s a polite, professional way to acknowledge and respond to another person’s request. “Per your request” is formal enough to be used professionally, including in business emails , customer service interactions, and when communicating with clients. The phrase implies the sender respects the instructions and has taken action accordingly. [1] X Research source It’s most commonly used in email and rarely in spoken conversations. Some people abbreviate “Per your request” to PYR when it’s in an email subject line. “Per” means “in accordance with” or “in line with.” “Your request” means a request made by the person reading the email."

      "content": "“As per your request” means the same thing as “per your request.” These phrases may be used interchangeably and both are grammatically correct. However, some feel that “as per your request” is cumbersome. “Per your request” is becoming more popular because many feel “as” is redundant and unnecessary. [2] X Research source “As per your request” is slightly more formal than “per your request” because it’s slightly antiquated. This phrase is sometimes abbreviated to APYR in situations where the writer is trying to save space, such as in an email subject line."

This allows you to be professional while letting them know the email is in response to their request and includes the information they wanted. For example: [3] X Research source PYR: Employee PTO File Dear Marjorie, Per your request in this morning’s meeting, the PTO file is attached to this email.

Include “per your request” when you write to your boss to confirm that you’ve performed the requested action and give an update on future plans. For example: PYR: Hiring Freelance Designers Dear Constance, Per your request, I’ve scheduled screening interviews with three freelance designers. Once I’ve spoken with them, I’ll provide you with notes from my calls. Thank you, Helena Vendor Information Request Keith, I’ve contacted the vendor rep for the product specifications, per your request.

      "title": "“Per your request” isn’t appropriate for every work email.",
      "content": "“Per your request” isn’t appropriate for every work email. When interacting with your colleagues, clients, and superiors, it’s important to maintain the right tone. What’s appropriate with your work friends may not be with your clients and vice versa. [4] X Research source It’s also important to maintain clarity in your communications. Here are situations when “per your request” might be confusing or not set the right tone: Avoid using it in casual conversations. Using \"per your request\" in a very casual or personal email may feel overly stiff. For example, if writing to a close colleague or friend, saying \"I’ve done what you asked\" might feel more appropriate. Try to avoid using it too often. Using \"per your request\" in every email can make communication feel cold or overly formal, especially in informal settings. Additionally, repeating \"per your request\" multiple times in one email or email chain makes it sound repetitive. Avoid using “per your request” when no request was made. Make sure you’ve received a clear, identifiable request before using the phrase. If no explicit request was made, it could confuse the reader or imply a misunderstanding. Don’t use “per your request” without clarifying details. Sometimes a simple “per your request” doesn’t provide enough information. This is especially true when the other party is a superior who makes multiple requests of you. It’s helpful to include additional details or updates that give the recipient a clearer picture of what’s been done or what to expect next. Avoid using it when the requested action isn’t complete. Don't use \"per your request\" if the task hasn’t been completed. Instead, clarify that you're still working on it, such as \"As requested, I’ve started preparing the report, and it will be ready by Friday.\""
