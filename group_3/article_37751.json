      "content": "Place a filter at one end of the roller for a safer cigarette. Using a filter is not required for rolling a cigarette, but it is recommended for health reasons. Take a loose cigarette filter and tuck it into the roller. Slide it all the way over to one side. Don’t leave any room between the filter and the edge of the roller or your cigarette will be too small. [2] X Research source Filters are important for filtering out some of the harmful chemicals that come from tobacco. While you can roll a cigarette without a filter, smoking cigarettes is more dangerous if you leave the filter off.

      "content": "Scoop enough tobacco for 1 cigarette into the roller. Grab some tobacco out of the bag and feed it into the roller. Fill the pocket of the roller up to the rails. Don’t go above the rails or the cigarette will be overpacked. [4] X Research source Don’t try to press or pack the tobacco too tightly or the cigarette will be difficult to smoke. When the roller is filled up to the rails, don’t try to stuff more tobacco in. It might take some trial and error to get the amount right at first. Add or take out tobacco as you need to until you figure out the correct amount."

      "title": "Spread the tobacco evenly throughout the roller.",
      "content": "Spread the tobacco evenly throughout the roller. Don’t let tobacco bunch up or concentrate in different areas. This could rip the rolling paper. Use your finger and even out the tobacco so it makes a uniform surface."

      "title": "Click the roller into the up position.",
      "content": "Click the roller into the up position. This closes the roller and secures the tobacco inside. Pick away any tobacco coming up through the rails. Don’t leave any residue on top of the rails. To check how big your cigarette will be, look at the side of the roller and look at the amount of tobacco in the chamber. If the cigarette looks too big or small to you, open the roller back up and adjust the amount of tobacco."

      "title": "Spin the roller down with your thumbs and up with your index fingers.",
      "content": "Spin the roller down with your thumbs and up with your index fingers. Hold the roller with both hands longways between your thumbs and index fingers. Then simultaneously roll down with your thumbs and up with your index fingers. Do one complete, 360-degree turn. This tightens the tobacco in preparation for inserting the rolling paper. [5] X Research source Make sure you use both your thumbs and index fingers to roll at the same time. If you only roll from one side, the cigarette will the too tight and uneven. Some rollers have a marking on the top of each rail that help you see when you’ve made a complete turn. If your roller has these markings, use them to judge how much you've rolled."

      "title": "Insert the rolling paper with the adhesive strip on top and facing you.",
      "content": "Insert the rolling paper with the adhesive strip on top and facing you. Take a strip of rolling paper insert it into the top of the roller between the 2 rails. Press the paper down a bit so the rails catch it when you roll. Leave the adhesive tape strip facing you so the cigarette seals properly. If you can't tell which side has the adhesive strip, hold the paper up to the light. The strip is reflective and looks shiny."

      "title": "Spin the roller until just the adhesive strip is sticking out.",
      "content": "Spin the roller until just the adhesive strip is sticking out. Use the same motion as before with your thumb and index fingers. The paper will slowly insert into the roller if it catches. Roll until just the adhesive strip sticks out. [6] X Research source It may take a few tries for the rolling paper to catch when you start rolling. If you’re spinning the rails but the paper isn’t catching, try pulling the paper out and resetting it. If you roll too far and the adhesive strip goes into the roller, open the roller up and take the paper out."

      "title": "Lick the adhesive strip and finish rolling the cigarette.",
      "content": "Lick the adhesive strip and finish rolling the cigarette. The moisture activates the glue on the adhesive strip so the cigarette seals. Then spin the roller a bit further so the strip adheres to the rest of the cigarette. You don’t have to do a complete turn. Spin until the adhesive strip completely enters the roller and then spin a bit more. If you don't want to lick the paper, wet your finger a little under the faucet and run it across the adhesive strip."

      "title": "Open up the roller and remove the cigarette.",
      "content": "Open up the roller and remove the cigarette. When you’ve finished spinning the roller, click it back into the down position to open the chamber. Turn the roller upside down to retrieve your freshly-rolled cigarette. [7] X Research source Try again if the cigarette is lumpy or uneven. It may take a few tries to get the rolling motion down perfectly. If the paper rips, you probably used too much tobacco. Open up the cigarette and try again with less tobacco."
