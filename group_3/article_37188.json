      "title": "Upcycle an old trunk to be a one-of-a-kind table.",
      "content": "Upcycle an old trunk to be a one-of-a-kind table. Not only is a vintage trunk coffee table super stylish, but it can also act as a storage compartment for remotes, games, or DVDs. And, if you place the trunk close enough to the couch, it can double as an ottoman or footrest. Clean up the trunk and consider making one or more of these alterations: Cut a piece of glass to fit on the top of the trunk. Screw wood planks on the bottom of the trunk to attach table legs. [1] X Research source Spray paint the trunk to match the room’s decor. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Turn a trunk on its side for a vintage nightstand. Spray paint the outside to match your tastes, or leave it as is for a more rustic look. Remove the hardware from the sides of the trunk. Place it on its side so it’s upright, then put a lamp on top to complete the look. [3] X Research source Consider leaving the separated compartments inside the trunk. This way, you’ll have “shelves” to store your bedtime items. A bedside table trunk also doubles as a storage container, so make sure not to place anything on the lip of the lid. Otherwise, you won’t be able to open the trunk up without everything on your nightstand tumbling down."

      "content": "Place a steamer trunk in a hallway to draw guests’ attention. Statement pieces can add pizzazz to just about any space, and an old trunk doubles as extra storage! Paint the trunk with a 2-in-1 primer paint to match your decor, or clean it up and leave it as is. Then, set it in a hall or entranceway, place cute knick-knacks on top, and presto—you have a unique DIY statement piece! [4] X Research source Try using paint stencils on the top of the trunk for a modern twist. Display vases of flowers or holiday decorations on top of the trunk."

      "content": "Store and organize clothes in an open trunk wardrobe. Back in the day, steamer trunks were used as deluxe closet suitcases. Because of this, trunk wardrobes are specifically designed to open on their side to access drawers and hanging space. [5] X Research source If you have a wardrobe trunk, leave it open in your bedroom to act as your dresser. [6] X Research source If you don’t have a wardrobe trunk, consider turning a storage trunk into a dresser by placing it on its side and sliding pieces of plywood into the larger section to act as shelves."

      "content": "Balance a mirror on top of the trunk so you can do your makeup. For this repurposing idea, all you have to do is clean up your old trunk. Then, set it against a wall in your bedroom. Place a mirror on top, and you're done! Now you have a designated space to do your makeup that doubles as storage and antique decor. Consider attaching table legs to the bottom of your trunk to raise the vanity off the floor."

      "content": "Store liquor inside the trunk for a make-shift bar. Clean out the inside of the trunk, removing any fabric and dividers. Coat the inside wood with polyurethane to protect the wood and give it a beautiful shine. Cut pieces of plywood to slide into the deepest part of the trunk to act as shelves for the wine. Put the trunk on its side, assemble, and presto—you have a DIY wine cabinet that’ll impress all your friends! [7] X Research source Add wine glass mounts to the lid of the trunk to store wine glasses inside the cabinet. Consider purchasing premade mounts or making your own out of wood by creating holes and notches in plywood."

      "content": "Cover the top of the trunk with glass so a TV can sit on it. A vintage trunk can be an awesome way to hold it up if you have a smaller TV. All you have to do is clean the trunk and set a piece of glass on top. This way, your TV has a level and durable surface to rest on. If the trunk doesn’t match your decor, no worries! Spray paint it or add new hardware to stick with your decor theme. If your trunk has ridges or curves on its lid, consider trying another repurposing idea, as anything but a flat surface will be difficult for the glass and TV to balance on."

      "content": "Give a child a place to store their toys with an old trunk. What child doesn’t love a treasure chest? Place your trunk in a child’s bedroom or playroom so they have extra space to store their toys. Consider painting the trunk to match the theme of the child’s room, or keep it looking worn for a “pirate” look. [8] X Research source Add wooden dividers inside the trunk to separate toys by type. Make sure you clean the outside and inside of the trunk thoroughly before letting a child play with it, as old objects could have harmful germs or bacteria on them."

      "content": "Make a cushion to sit on top of the trunk for a cute seat. Putting a homemade cushion on the lid gives you a comfortable place to read, tie your shoes, or gaze out the window. Simply clean up the trunk, measure the top, and sew a bench cushion to fit perfectly across the lid. Stick the bench cushion to the trunk using hook-and-loop fastener so it’s easier to remove and wash. Consider upholstering the trunk lid if you have a smaller trunk. Remove the lid by unscrewing the hinges, wrap the lid in fabric (stuffing with foam if you’d like), and then screw it back onto the trunk. [9] X Research source If you’re not crafty, no problem! Buy a premade seat cushion the size of your trunk’s lid. Who says your cushioned trunk seat has to stay by the window? Move it out in the hall or entryway to act as a bench."

      "content": "Set an old trunk at the end of a bed to store blankets or towels. The inside of many old trunks is already separated into sections, and you can use this to your advantage. Paint the outside of the box (if you’d like), cover the inside with contact paper , and place it wherever you need extra storage. [10] X Research source Put the repurposed trunk in your bedroom, guest room, living room, or closet."
