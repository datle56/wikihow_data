      "content": "Try a switch hit shot. This shot was made famous by Kevin Pietersen in 2008. [4] X Research source In this shot, a batsman changes his handedness and posture to adopt a stance the mirror image of his traditional handedness while the bowler is running in to bowl. As a fielding team cannot change the placing of fielders while the bowler is in his run-up, the fielding side is effectively wrong-footed with the fielders out of position. This shot's legality was confirmed by the ICC in 2008. The shot is risky because a batsman is less proficient in the other-handedness and is more likely to make a mistake in the execution of his shot."
