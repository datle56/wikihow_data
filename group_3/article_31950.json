When you have an avoidant attachment style, it can be easy to start worrying about the future (or get stuck in thoughts from the past). If you notice yourself doing that, try to stay grounded, and notice everything around you. Keep focusing on what’s happening now, not what might happen in the future.

However, everyone has their own demons to deal with, and you’re never going to find someone that doesn’t have problems. Try to accept that your loved ones and partners will have flaws, just like you. [12] X Research source It can be helpful to compare someone else’s flaws to what they do well. If you catch yourself judging someone else, try thinking, “Sure, they might never be on time, but at least they always remember to text me back.” You can also look for the deeper meaning within your own judgment. For instance, when your friend is late, does it make you feel uncared for? If so, you can work through those emotions and recognize that their lateness has nothing to do with you."
