A popular website called Chartbundle used to make it easy for pilots to find free world aeronautical charts, but as many have noticed, the site no longer exists. You can still find some websites that host archives of the Chartbundle KML files, or you can download sectional aeronautical raster charts in a georeferenced raster format like Geo-TIFF format (.tif or .tiff) from the FAA. A few places to find free usable aeronautical chart data for use in Google Earth: FAA VFR raster charts (Geo-TIFF) FAA US Sectional Charts (KML) (scroll to the bottom, click Generate KML , and download the generated file) [1] X Research source Chartbundle world aviation charts (KML) You can also view sectional aeronautical charts in SkyVector , export a flight plan in the FPL format, and use this FPL to KML converter to create a KML file you can overlay in Google Earth.

The maps will load in increasingly higher resolution as you zoom in. When you stop moving the view, give it a few seconds to download the higher-resolution tiles. There are thousands of tiles altogether that make up the maps. The faster your internet connection , the faster the tiles will load."
