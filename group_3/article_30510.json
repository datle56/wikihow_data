This is known as the \"confidence gap.\" Keep this in mind as you enter adulthood: even if you feel nervous about a task, you might very well be the most competent person in the room. Some ways you can overcome the confidence gap include: Seeking out female role models. Find women in leadership positions who can help you learn leadership skills of your own, such as how to speak with confidence, how to supervise a team, and how to engage in constructive criticism.

Practice speaking to others with power and confidence. Stand up straight, project your voice, keep eye contact with your listeners, and speak in definitive tones.

Just as young women depend on other women for leadership skills, you have the potential to be a key role model for younger generations too. Pass along your unique knowledge and skill sets to a younger woman who could benefit from it, and continue to hone your leadership skills."

Find journalists you respect and follow their stories. Read well-researched nonfiction books about topics you care about. Make your own conclusions. While you will have to get your information from other sources at first, eventually you will be able to analyze events on your own. If you are old enough to vote, you can vote for the candidates and policies that align most closely with your own.

Other things to keep in mind are: Keeping your hair tidy. Whether your hair is long or short, straight or curly, you will want to find ways to keep your hair from appearing messy. Perhaps you will put your hair up into a bun, find a short cut that you can maintain easily, or trim your split ends frequently. Taking care of your clothing. Make sure that your clothing fits and that you are taking care that your clothes are clean, wrinkle-free, and in good shape. Always dress up in clothes that fit well.

If you choose to wear accessories, make sure they are age-appropriate, adhere to dress codes for work or school, and that you are not allergic to them. For example, a bright pink unicorn necklace might have been appropriate when you were a girl in school, but will likely be frowned upon at your new job at a local bank.

      "content": "Read about the effects of puberty. Puberty is the phase of biological development when a child's body transforms into an adult body. Puberty will lead to a number of physical and emotional changes in a girl as she develops into a woman. In girls, puberty usually begins between the ages of 8 and 13 and can last for as long as 6 years. [16] X Research source It is important that you understand what kinds of changes to expect, so that you are not shocked or scared by how your body is transforming. Typical changes during puberty include: Growing taller and going through growth spurts. Developing hips and breasts. Hip and breast soreness and tenderness are typical during this period. Growing underarm and pubic hair. Sweating more profusely. Developing acne and other skin changes. Beginning to menstruate. Experiencing mood changes and mood swings. Note that if you have not started menstruating by the time you are 14 years old, you should talk to your doctor to make sure everything is developing properly."

She can serve as an important mentor during this time in your life.

      "title": "Learn to embrace your changing body.",
      "content": "Learn to embrace your changing body. The years when you mature into a woman can be exciting, but also daunting. Many girls become stressed out because of weight gain, skin changes, new curves, and sudden growth spurts. Between 50% and 88% of young women report negative feelings about their bodies during this vulnerable period of time. Try to engage in body-positive activities so that you are not trapped in negative thoughts. For example: Tell yourself that media portrayals are not accurate. It can be easy to compare yourself negatively to the models and actors you see in the media. Remember that models and celebrities are not the norm. Keep in mind that special effects, make-up teams, professional lighting techniques, and airbrushing are all used to change the appearance of celebrities. If necessary, avoid unrealistic media portrayals of girls and women: turn off the television, close the fashion magazine, and spend some time with your friends instead. Compliment yourself. Even if puberty is bringing unwanted changes (such as acne), perhaps there are things that you like about your new body. Do you like being taller? Feeling more adult? Having curves? Look at yourself in the mirror, and give yourself compliments. You should feel proud of how you've grown. Compliment your friends. Remember that your friends are probably experiencing negative or uncertain thoughts about their bodies, just like you. Tell your friends all the things you appreciate about them, and help boost their self-esteem. Maintain healthy eating and exercise habits. Many young women are tempted to go on extreme crash diets or exercise too often in response to their changing bodies. However, gaining body weight, increasing body fat, and growing rounder are normal, healthy changes to a developing body. Resist the temptation to go into extremes and instead follow common-sense rules about diet and exercise. Always eat nutritious food when you are hungry, and never starve yourself. Talk to your doctor about concerns about your body. If you feel like something is not right with your body, talk to your doctor. Your doctor will be able to help you decide whether the change is normal and healthy. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (or CBT) has been shown to be an effective treatment for those who develop a negative body image. If you experience persistent negative thoughts about your body image, talk to a doctor or counselor. You don't have to live with these thoughts, and you can feel happier and more confident with proper treatment."

Some of the physical changes caused by puberty will require that you purchase new clothing or supplies in order to stay comfortable in your body. You might have to go on several different shopping sprees as you go through different stages of puberty. It might also take you a while before you discover what products you like the best. Having a friend or mentor help you shop will make the process easier. Everyone has different preferences, but in general you can expect to shop for the following items: [18] X Trustworthy Source HealthyChildren.org Health information from the American Academy of Pediatrics. Go to source When you notice yourself sweating more, you can begin to shop for deodorants (which mask body odor) and antiperspirants (which reduce the amount of underarm sweating). When you notice that your breasts are growing and becoming sore, you can shop for training bras and bras. These items will provide you with support and coverage. When you notice your body hair growing or darkening, you might want to purchase razors or waxing kits. Not everyone wants to get rid of her body hair, however: decide what is right for you! When you begin to menstruate, you can begin to purchase tampons or maxi pads in order to protect your clothing from stains. If you experience unwanted acne , you can purchase over-the-counter medication and face washes to help. You can also talk to your doctor about prescription medications that might be stronger. When you find yourself growing taller and curvier, you can shop for new clothing, either in the Juniors' or the Women's section of clothing stores. Because you are growing quickly, you might grow out of your old clothing at a rate faster than what you are used to. You can consider shopping at a thrift store in order to keep your costs down as you explore what it means to dress a woman's body and find your own unique style."
