At the same time, imagine you're standing against a wall, and slide the back of your head up along that imaginary wall. [2] X Expert Source Steve Horney PT, MPT, MTC, CSCS Licensed Physical Therapist Expert Interview. 3 June 2020. When you sit in front of a monitor all day, the bottom half of your neck ends up flexed, but the top part ends up in extension so you can see the screen. To help relieve that, you need to have the top portion of your neck flexed forward, with the bottom part sitting over itself. Hold this stretch for two to three breaths. You should feel your neck muscles and your shoulder muscles lengthening. Inhale as you lift your head and return to the starting position. Repeat this exercise two to three times, holding for two to three breathes at a time."

      "content": "Combine chin tucks with neck tilts. Start by tucking your chin in toward your chest and lifting the back of your head. Then, inhale and tilt your head to the right side. Extend and elongate your neck towards the space to your right, rather than try to bring your ear to your shoulder. You should feel a stretch on your left shoulder and the left side of your neck. Hold this position for three breaths. As you exhale, raise your neck and look forward. Then, inhale as you tilt your head to the left side. Hold this position for three breaths. [3] X Expert Source Steve Horney PT, MPT, MTC, CSCS Licensed Physical Therapist Expert Interview. 3 June 2020. Neck tilts are a good way to start your neck stretching routine, as they will help to lengthen the larger muscles in your neck and relax your whole body. Lengthening and stretching the small muscles in your neck can also prevent tension headaches. [4] X Research source Sit in a comfortable cross-legged position on an exercise mat or a soft surface. You can use props like a yoga block or a pillow and sit on them to make the seated position more comfortable. You can repeat this exercise two to three times on each side. You can also add some resistance by placing your hand against your head and gently applying pressure to your head as you tilt your head to one side. If you are tilting your head to the right side, for example, you would use your left hand to apply light pressure on the left side of your head. Do not pull or tug on your neck and only apply light, gentle pressure on your head."

Once you have warmed up your neck muscles with several opening stretches, you can try a cobra pose to strengthen your shoulder muscles, and your neck and upper back muscles. This pose can help improve your posture and your overall spine health. It is recommended that you stretch out tense neck muscles first before doing cobra pose. [8] X Research source Begin by lying face down on a mat, with your forehead flat on the mat or resting on a thin towel for support. Your arms should be at your sides, with your palms flat on the mat. Place your tongue on the roof of your mouth, as this will help to stabilize your neck muscles. Inhale and squeeze your shoulder blades together as you lift your hands and arms, letting them hover a few inches above the mat. Lift your forehead about an inch off the mat with your gaze straight ahead and down. Hold this position for six to eight breaths, making sure your head is facing downward and you are putting weight into your legs and pressing your toes down on the mat. Repeat this pose again two to three times. Rest between each pose with one side of your head flat on the mat."

      "content": "Massage the trigger points on your neck. Massage can help you to work out and release any tension in your neck muscles, especially if you tend to feel tension in the same spot on your neck. These trigger points are tight knots of muscle fiber that are stressed or strained. To give yourself a neck massage, start by using your thumb and forefinger to gently press on the muscles that line your neck and shoulder area, also known as the trapezius muscle, which stretches from the base of your skull down to the middle of your back and over your shoulder. You may feel multiple trigger points on your trapezius muscle. These trigger points will feel rope like and when you apply light pressure, you may feel discomfort spread throughout the muscle area. Use your thumb and forefinger or your knuckles to gently rub and knead out your strained neck muscles. If there is a coworker, friend, or partner nearby, you may ask them to help you rub and knead out the trigger points on your trapezius muscles. You can also get a professional massage done on your neck and shoulder muscles. Going for monthly massages can help to reduce neck tension and pain."

Lie down on it lengthwise, with your upper back on the foam roll. You can place your hands on your hips or on either side of your body. Keeping your torso parallel to the ground, roll your upper back and scapular muscles sideways against the foam roller. You should start to feel tension releasing in any sore trigger points. Roll at least 20 times on each side of your body to release neck and shoulder tension. You can use the foam roller on a daily basis to help manage any muscle pain or tightness."

Sleeping on too many pillows can cause your neck to bend unnaturally, which can cause neck tension. Try to sleep on only one to two pillows or get a cervical pillow, which are contoured to support your head and neck. These pillows also keep your neck aligned with your spine.

Neck tension is often caused by sitting in one position for long periods of time, usually when working on a computer or driving in a car for several hours at a time. Adjusting your posture in these stationary positions can help to reduce neck tension and improve your spinal health. [13] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Medical School Harvard Medical School's Educational Site for the Public Go to source When sitting at a computer, try to adjust your posture so your alignment is correct and you are not putting excessive stress on your neck muscles. Move your computer screen so it is at eye level on your desk. Test the setup of your computer by sitting in your office chair. Make sure your gaze is directly in the center of your computer screen. You should also try to keep your head in the center of your computer screen, rather than leaning to one side. You can also use a hands-free device, like a headset, if you talk on the phone throughout the day and do not want to have to hold the phone between your ear and your shoulder. If you are looking at any notebook or notes while typing at your computer, you can use a paper holder next to your computer screen. This will help you avoid keeping your head turned and down to one side while typing. Take breaks throughout the work day and move around every 20-30 minutes so your neck does not tense up or get stuck in one position. Check your eye prescription if you're having a lot of neck pain at work. If you're straining to see, you might be leaning forward throughout the day without realizing it.
