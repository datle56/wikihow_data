      "title": "Draw a semi-circle on a piece of construction paper to start the cone.",
      "content": "Draw a semi-circle on a piece of construction paper to start the cone. Choose heavy construction paper in the color that you want the hat to be. Press the point of a compass on the long side of your paper so it's right in the middle. Then, pull the compass pencil out so it's 9 to 12 inches (23 to 30 cm) from the point. Swing the pencil to draw a curve from 1 side of the paper to the other. [1] X Research source If you don't have a compass, tie a string to a pencil. Use a string that's the same size as the width of the semi-circle. Then, hold the string at the edge and pull it taut before you draw the curve with the pencil. Make the semi-circle 9 inches (23 cm) wide if the hat is for a little kid. Draw a 12 in (30 cm) wide semi-circle if the hat is for an older kid or adult."

      "title": "Cut out the semi-circle and overlap the pointed ends to form the cone.",
      "content": "Cut out the semi-circle and overlap the pointed ends to form the cone. Use scissors to carefully cut the curved line you drew on the construction paper. Then, hold a pointed end with each hand and bring them together so the paper curves. Keep pulling the ends together and overlap them by at least 1 inch (2.5 cm). [2] X Research source It's important to overlap the pointed ends so there isn't a gap along the long side of the cone."

    {
      "title": "Staple the bottom of the cone where the points overlap.",
      "content": "Staple the bottom of the cone where the points overlap. If you let go of the points, the cone comes undone. To keep its shape, staple the bottom of the cone where the edges overlap. [3] X Research source If you don't have a stapler, you can use double-sided tape or glue to keep the edges in place. Keep in mind that these aren't as sturdy and if you're rough with the hat, the paper may come undone."

      "title": "Cut 1⁄2 in (1.3 cm) slits 1 in (2.5 cm) apart around the bottom of the cone.",
      "content": "Cut 1 ⁄ 2 in (1.3 cm) slits 1 in (2.5 cm) apart around the bottom of the cone. Make fringe along the base of the cone so you can attach it to the brim of the hat. Take scissors and cut 1 ⁄ 2 inch (1.3 cm) slits along the bottom of the cone. Leave 1 inch (2.5 cm) between each slit. Then, bend each slit so it points away from the cone. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Draw a circle on construction paper to start the brim of the hat.",
      "content": "Draw a circle on construction paper to start the brim of the hat. Lay a ruler across the bottom of the cone and write down the measurement. Then, draw a line the same size on construction paper. Put your compass point on the middle of the line and swing the pencil around to draw a circle. [5] X Research source Adjust your compass so the circle has the same diameter as the cone measurement."

      "content": "Make another circle that's 3 to 4 in (7.6 to 10.2 cm) larger than the one you drew. This larger circle is the outer brim for the hat. Put the point of the compass in the middle of the line you drew for your first circle and pull the pencil out by 3 or 4 inches (7.6 or 10.2 cm). Use the pencil to draw a larger circle around your first one. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Cut out the circles for the brim and discard the small one. Use scissors to cut out the big circle and discard the scrap paper. Then, carefully poke a hole in the center of the small circle so you can stick your scissors into the paper. Cut out the small circle and get rid of it. [7] X Research source If you have a box cutter and a cutting mat, set the paper on the mat and use the box cutter to cut out the inner circle. Always use caution when you work with a sharp box cutter."

      "content": "Glue the top of the cone's fringe and slide the brim onto the cone. Squeeze craft glue onto the tops of the slits that you folded away from the cone. Before the glue has a chance to dry, push the large circle you just cut out onto the cone. Press along the base to stick the fringe to the brim piece. [8] X Research source If you don't have glue, turn the hat over and tape the fringe to the brim."

      "title": "Decorate your hat with drawings, stickers, or glitter glue.",
      "content": "Decorate your hat with drawings, stickers, or glitter glue. If you're making the wizard hat for a kid, set out lots of fun items for them to put on the hat. Get out glow-in-the-dark stickers, glittery glue, or markers for drawing custom designs. For example, press crescent moon stickers on the cone of the hat and draw swirls of glitter glue around the brim. Don't forget to dry the hat completely before you put it on! [9] X Research source Buy a package of shimmer star or moon stickers if you want to give the hat a mystical look. If you don't have glitter glue, squeeze craft glue onto the hat and sprinkle glitter over the glue. For example, make stars, planets, or words like \"boo!\" on the hat."

      "content": "Draw a 20 in (51 cm) diameter circle out of felt to start the brim. Spread 1 yard (0.91 m) of 3 mm (0.12 in) felt on your work surface and tie a 10 in (25 cm) piece of string to a fabric pencil or marker. Hold the end of the string 10 inches (25 cm) from a corner of the felt and press it down with your finger. Pull the fabric pencil so the string is taut and use it to draw a 20 in (51 cm) wide circle on the felt. [10] X Research source Choose any color of felt for your wizard's hat. Black, gray, and brown are all great choices. Since this hat has a crooked, floppy look around the brim, it's fine if your circle isn't perfectly round."

      "content": "Cut 2 felt circles that are 20 inches (51 cm) in diameter. Once you've drawn the circle on the felt, use scissors to cut it out. Then, lay the circle on the piece of felt that's on your work surface and cut around it to make an identical circle. [11] X Research source If you don't want to use scissors, place the felt on a cutting mat and use a rotary cutter to cut out the circles."

      "content": "Draw an 8 or 9 in (20 or 23 cm) diameter circle in the center of the large circle. Shorten the string so it's 8 or 9 inches (20 or 23 cm) long and hold it down in the center of your large felt circle. Extend the string and use the attached fabric pencil or marker to draw a smaller circle on the felt. [12] X Research source Make the small circle 8 inches (20 cm) in diameter if you want the wizard's hat to fit high on your head or if you're making it for a kid. To make a slouchy wizard's hat that sits down on your forehead, draw the circle 9 inches (23 cm) in diameter."

      "title": "Cut a line through the brim so you can cut out the small circle.",
      "content": "Cut a line through the brim so you can cut out the small circle. Stick 4 sewing pins through the felt layers around the small circle. This keeps them from sliding around while you cut. Use your scissors to cut a straight line from the edge of the large circle to the small circle. Then, cut around the small circle and discard the small circles of felt. [13] X Research source Try to cut about 1 ⁄ 2 inch (1.3 cm) away from the line towards the middle of the circle. This gives you a little extra space for sewing. If you want to make the brim of the hat slope down, cut a 3 in (7.6 cm) wedge from the felt brim pieces. Separate them and bring the edges of 1 piece together. Sew straight stitches to join the edges so you have a droopy circle and repeat this for the other brim piece."

      "content": "Sew the outer edge of the brim and flip the top layer of felt under the batting. Take your pinned brim to the sewing machine and make straight stitches around the outside edge of the circle. Leave about a 1 ⁄ 2 inch (1.3 cm) seam allowance. Then, grab hold of the top layer of felt and flip it underneath the batting so the batting is between the felt layers. [16] X Research source If you don't have a sewing machine, thread a sewing needle and make straight stitches around both sides of the brim."

      "title": "Cut a triangle out of the felt for the cone.",
      "content": "Cut a triangle out of the felt for the cone. Fold the remaining felt in half lengthwise and lay it flat. Use a yardstick to draw a straight line that's 22 inches (56 cm) long on the folded side. Keep 1 end of the yardstick in place and swing the other end of the yardstick away by about 10 inches (25 cm). Draw this line so it connects to the side and make a line at the bottom to connect the triangle. [17] X Research source"

Leave a 1 ⁄ 4 inch (0.64 cm) seam allowance as you sew. Then, flip the cone inside out so you can't see the stitches. [18] X Research source If you don't have a sewing machine, thread a sewing needle and make straight stitches by hand."

      "title": "Stitch the base of the cone to the inner brim of the hat.",
      "content": "Stitch the base of the cone to the inner brim of the hat. Lower the brim down onto the cone so it fits snugly at the base of the hat. Turn it upside down so you can see the inside and pin the cone to the brim. Then, sew around the inner brim and leave a 1 ⁄ 4 inch (0.64 cm) seam allowance. [19] X Research source If you don't want to worry about sewing through all the layers of fabric, straight stitch around the inner brim materials before you attach the cone to it."

      "title": "Stuff the inside of the cone with batting if you want the hat to point up.",
      "content": "Stuff the inside of the cone with batting if you want the hat to point up. To give your wizard's hat some character and shape, get out stuffing or pull apart batting so it's fluffy. Push it into the inside of the cone until it's as stiff as you like. To keep the batting from falling out, you can sew one of the small scrap circles of felt to the inside of the hat. [20] X Research source If you want a floppier hat, don't put stuffing inside the cone."
