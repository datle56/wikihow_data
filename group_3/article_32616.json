For instance, you may notice bluish or dusky tinges on their fingernails, lips, or skin. [5] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source However, be aware that children and toddlers compensate for a lack of oxygen better than adults and may not turn blue as fast as an adult would."

You'll likely need this information when you call 911 or your local emergency number. [7] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source You'll also need to move on to the steps for an unconscious choking toddler if they’re not conscious.

If a parent is present, quickly ask for consent. But remember, seconds count when saving a life! If nobody is around to ask, don’t wait. If you live in the U.S., Good Samaritan laws in your state should cover any action you take in good faith to save the child's life."
