If you’re moving to a new home , try to handle the utility transfer at least 10 days or about 2 weeks before you arrive so you won’t run into billing issues with the previous tenant. If you’re declaring a name change or switching the bill from one member of the household to another, handle the transfer as soon as possible to avoid any paperwork mishaps or legal complications. [1] X Trustworthy Source State of Michigan Official website for the State of Michigan Go to source If you fail to transfer the utility, the person named on the original bill remains liable for future payments. This situation can lead to legal issues if that person moves out or if your lease requires you to change the bill over. Some landlords include utility services in your normal housing bill, meaning you won’t have to put them in your name."

Landlords won’t allow you to put someone else’s name on the utility bill unless they’re included in the lease. If you paid a deposit, the utility company may give it back once you switch the bill to someone else’s name. This isn’t always the case, however.
