I don’t think I’m capable of handling a new job, even if it is a promotion. I get upset very easily. I argue with the people in my life a lot. I get defensive and yell at my family. My friend calls me “Cat” all the time and I don’t like it, but I’m afraid if I say anything, she won’t be my friend. I’m too self-conscious to have sex. I have sex even when I don’t want to.

Opinions are not irrefutable. An example of an opinion is: “I’m always stupid.” This statement is refutable. Some might think it’s not, and they will offer evidence of times where they feel they were stupid, such as, “I’m so stupid, I fell off the stage when I was eight.” However, when exploring this experience, a person can learn a few things, such as: If an adult was responsible for overseeing the project, that person should have considered your safety. People are not perfect and make mistakes. Even Einstein has admitted some mistakes in his career. This shows that no one is really stupid if they make mistakes. Even geniuses make mistakes. And not just one or two, but lots and lots of them.

Stop thinking of yourself in terms of weaknesses and instead think about areas you would like to improve, and only because changing them will make you happy.

Think of negative statements from others as ten-pound weights. If you put on a ten-pound weight for every negative statement, and you are surrounded by people who put you down, eventually it becomes more and more difficult to lift yourself up.

If you’re having trouble getting your point across, Psychology Tools recommends using a “broken record” approach, where you maintain politeness and a pleasant tone. For example, if your local supermarket sold you a bad piece of meat and will not accept returns, you can always say, “I understand. I would still like a refund.” If after several attempts you don’t see your results, you can always try a statement like this, “If you do not want to issue me a refund, that’s your choice. I can always choose to call the Health Department, though I’d rather not. Which would be easier for the both of us?”"

Some behaviors from other people can have a direct impact on your self-esteem if you hear it long enough. For instance, if you decide you don’t want other people calling you names, you can let them know you don’t like it and you will take action if they do not stop: “I don’t like it when you call me Shorty. It upsets me. I would appreciate it if you would stop.” If this form of verbal abuse does not stop, take action and tell someone with authority that can help you. If you’re at work, file a harassment complaint. If you’re a student, tell your parents, a teacher, or your principal. If it’s a friend, your friend might not have realized that his or her actions were getting you upset. It’s always worth it to let people know how you feel."

It’s natural to want to focus only on them to provide them the best environment possible. However, if you stop focusing on yourself and neglect yourself, this can detract from being the parent you really want to be. Parents are teachers to their children. In order for teachers to be truly effective, teachers must have some sort of expertise. Moreover, your own personal habits might eventually rub off on them, and this includes the bad ones as well as the good ones. Choosing to take care of yourself a few minutes a day is all it takes not only to raise your own self-esteem, but also to serve as a great example for your kids.

Because I just want it. A little planning at the grocery store could help prevent this from occurring: Buy chopped veggies, such as chopped lettuce and baby carrots for a quick salad. Buy nuts or sunflower seeds for a quick fiber/protein/healthy fats boost. You can add them to your salad for extra crunch. Many fruits are portable, such as bananas and apples."

Not only do we become attached to foods because it gives us comfort (like mom’s chocolate chip cookies), but once your body is in an unhealthy cycle, processed foods like white sugar play hormonal havoc on your body and the craving for sweets cycle becomes self-sustaining. When you’re fighting your body to end the sweet cravings, this can make us feel like we’re not in control of what we eat, which can lower self-esteem. If you have frequent cravings for something sugar-laden, here are some tips to wean yourself off of that white sugar: Crave something sweet in the morning? Replace your pastry, sugar-laden cereal, and coffee cake with oatmeal topped with stevia, cinnamon, fruit, and milk. If you don’t like oats (some people don’t like the mush factor), try brown rice instead. Need an afternoon shot of sugar? Try some dates and nuts. Want an after-dinner dessert? Try a couple of squares of dark chocolate (choose the brand with the least amount of sugar) and peanut butter. Need to add a little more sweetness? Melt your chocolate, stir in the peanut butter, and add some agave nectar or stevia. Not sweet enough? You can also mix in some raisins. To increase the yum factor even more, put in a pinch of unsweetened shredded coconut."

      "content": "Try cognitive behavioural therapy. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) has been shown to be effective at improving self-esteem. CBT addresses automatic negative thoughts. These thoughts are the thoughts that happen almost like a reflex when confronted with life situations. For example, if a person with low self-esteem needs to study for an exam in school, the person might say, “I don’t know why I’m bothering. It’s not like I’ll get an A anyway.” When undergoing CBT therapy, the therapist, who will most likely be a counselor or psychologist, works in partnership with the client to change those automatic beliefs. The counselor might suggest testing the client’s hypothesis—the client will fail no matter how hard the client studies. The counselor might help the client with time management and stress skills and track studying progress until the student takes the test. Other techniques used for CBT are relaxation techniques (breathing exercises), visualization (mental rehearsing), and going through childhood experiences to identify where the negative thoughts originated. Identifying the origin of the negative thoughts helps prevent self-esteem “relapses.” CBT is good for people who do not have complex issues. Moreover, CBT is only good for treating some types of disorders such as depression and anxiety. CBT might also be too structured for some people."

Understanding the potential effects of low self-esteem may help motivate you to improve your outlook now. Low self-esteem may lead people to do any of the following: Tolerate abusive relationships because they feel they are deserving of the treatment or don’t deserve better treatment. Bully or abuse other people. Be afraid to take on goals, objectives, or dreams because they don’t think they are able to achieve them. Become perfectionists to make up for their own perceived flaws. Always feel self-conscious around other people, be overly preoccupied with their appearance, or think that other people think negatively of them. Constantly look for indicators that other people don’t like them or think poorly of them. Think they are a lost cause. Have a low threshold for stress.

      "content": "Pinpoint the root of your self-esteem problem. Usually, low self-esteem starts with external events. People are not born with low self-esteem. It begins with our needs not being met, negative feedback from others, or thinking that a negative life event is our fault. For example, children may blame themselves for their parents’ divorce or parents feel helpless to help their children process their emotions. Children who grow up in poverty and children of minorities are often at higher risk for developing low self-esteem."

      "content": "Understand the low self-esteem cycle. When children (or adults) first begin to question their worth, it is possible for other people or life events to reinforce the negative feelings, which can solidify self-beliefs that lead to low self-esteem. The following are three examples that show the cycle in action: A child hears someone call him stupid when he makes a mistake. From then on, he believes he is stupid whenever he makes a mistake. Or, he believes he is stupid just because he makes a mistake. A kid does not receive support or praise from her parents. She starts to believe she is not beautiful, wonderful, or worthy of praise because her own parents don’t even believe in her. A person repeatedly hears derogatory statements because of the color of his skin. He eventually believes he will not be able to succeed in a society that does not accept him."

      "content": "Remember how your parents treated you. Parents have been found to have the strongest influence on people’s self-esteem. Children’s impressions of themselves are by and large formed with the help of their parents. There are several different types of parental behaviors that contribute to low self-esteem. Most often, when children are raised in a strict home that does not provide children with emotional support, children’s self-esteem suffers. [3] X Research source When kids and adults have emotional support, their emotional needs are met. Emotional support can be shown in many ways, such as: saying, “I love you,” or “I’m proud of you”; helping kids with their own feelings and emotions and how to cope; and simply just being there. Emotional needs are real needs people have as they grow, along with physical (food and drink) and mental (learning, problem-solving, and education) needs. Paying attention to emotional needs, as well as physical and mental needs, helps children feel accepted and respected."

      "content": "Recognize instances of shaming in your life. Shaming is a common parenting tool to help control the behavior of kids. [4] X Research source For instance, public shaming of kids on social media has become more common. Shaming occurs when someone, such as a caretaker, parent, teacher, or other authority figure, or other peers, makes you feel like you are an awful person for behaving in a certain manner or making a mistake. For example, if you don’t arrive on time to work, your boss might make you feel ashamed if he says, “You are not a reliable person,” rather than, “You need to come to work earlier. Try aiming for arriving to work half an hour earlier. This way, if anything goes wrong, you’ll have that extra time.” While shaming is socially accepted, it is actually an abusive behavior, and often occurs with other abusive behaviors that produce the feeling of being shamed. For example, author Beverly Engel recalls her mother spanking her in front of her neighbors, or punishing her with public displays of yelling and screaming when she made a mistake. These incidences produced feelings of shame."

      "content": "Identify abuse in past relationships. Abusive relationship patterns are often the cause for low self-esteem. Patterns such as berating, belittling, controlling, yelling, or criticizing can all contribute to people’s thoughts of themselves. Over time, when these behaviors are repeated over and over, the victim might believe this negative input. Abusive relationships can also affect adults. The relationships we have in adulthood often reflect our childhood relationships. Relationship patterns are formed in childhood, which affects our expectations of our future relationships."

It has been found over decades of research studies a persistent, but moderate, link between poor academic performance and low self-esteem. This is not surprising, considering school is part of most of our lives for a majority of our childhoods and during our formative years."

Job loss, financial difficulties, a breakup, physical and mental illness, chronic pain, and disability are types of situations that can be chronically stressful and wear away at a person’s self-esteem. Divorce, events that produce trauma, such as being in a car or work accident, being the victim of an attack, or the death of a family member or friend, can affect self-esteem as well. Financial stress and living in an economically depressed area can affect also self-esteem."

It has been revealed through research that there is a generally accepted definition of beauty. While these ideals are culturally influenced, there is a socially accepted idea of beauty. If a person receives a lot of rejection or acceptance for their appearance, this could have an influence on a person’s self-worth. Research has found that when people evaluate their own physical appearance, it is consistently skewed towards the negative and may not accurately reflect our true attributes. In other words, most people are overly critical of their physical appearance."

There are consequences to self-esteem for both the bully and the victim in this vicious cycle. Victims of bullying often have to live for years with the memories of being victimized. They often feel embarrassed about the abuse and attacks. Bullies most often already suffer from low self-esteem and feel more control when they victimize others. Many bullies are likely victims of abuse and neglect in their own homes. To regain a sense of control, they victimize other people."
