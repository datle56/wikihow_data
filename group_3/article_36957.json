If you can open the document with your version of Word, saving it in a format such as .rtf (rich text format) or .txt (ASCII text format) may strip out whatever codes corrupted the file in .doc or .docx format. After opening the converted document, you can re-save a new version in .doc or .docx format to see if the problem returns. Be aware that the .txt format does not support text formatting features such as bold, italics, and underlining. If your document has extensive formatting, save it in .rtf format to preserve the formatting before re-saving it in .doc or .docx format. Some Word documents may be corrupted in such a way that a file saved in a different file format in Word may not be able to be opened again."
