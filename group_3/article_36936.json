      "content": "Check your irrigation system’s valve boxes to see if there’s a leak in the valves. Locate the sprinkler valve boxes, which are usually hidden underneath hard plastic or metal lids in your yard near the sprinkler heads. Lift the lid of each of your valve boxes and check the soil to see if it’s wet. If there’s standing water inside one of the valve boxes, then the leak may be occurring because debris is trapped in the valve. If the boxes are dry, then the leak may be located somewhere else in your yard. [3] X Research source The number of valve boxes in your yard depends on how many sprinklers you have attached to your system. Smaller systems may only have 1-2 valve boxes, but larger systems may have multiple spread throughout the yard. If you aren’t sure where your valve boxes are in your yard, call an irrigation professional to inspect your system for you."

Rotate the dial on the irrigation system’s controller to turn on individual sprinkler zones, and watch how the sprinklers work while they’re running. If the sprinkler head has a weak flow or doesn’t spray as efficiently as normal, then you may have an issue with the hose connection or a clog in the filter. When you notice a problem with a sprinkler head, mark it with a stake flag so you’re able to locate it while the system is turned off. [4] X Research source Inconsistent spray could also happen due to a leaking valve or a broken hose. You can buy stake flags from your local hardware store."

When you run your irrigation system, look between your sprinklers to see if you notice any water pooling there. Flooding in a specific area of your yard may mean the hose or pipe underneath the area is broken and needs to be replaced. Once you determine where the water is pooling, mark off the area with stake flags so you know where to dig to replace a section of the hose. [6] X Research source Water may not pool in an area if you live on a slope or if the leak is small. If you’re still unable to locate where the leak is occurring, turn off the water supply to your system and call an irrigation specialist to look for you. They may be able to find the leak and offer repair services for it."

Look for the shut-off valve for your irrigation system either inside or outside near your water meter, and rotate the handle so it’s perpendicular to the pipe. Wait 2-3 minutes for the water to empty from your irrigation pipes and hoses before continuing so you don’t cause any additional leaks. [7] X Research source Always keep your irrigation system’s water supply off while you make repairs or else water will constantly run through the pipes and make it difficult or messy to work with."

Use a screwdriver to rotate the screws counterclockwise and set them in a small container so you don’t lose them in your yard. Pull the lid off of the valve to reveal a circular rubber piece, also known as the diaphragm. [8] X Research source If you can’t easily access the lid on the valve due to flooding, then use a bucket or a turkey baster to get some of the water out of the way."

If the diaphragm still looks like it’s in good condition, run it underneath water from your sink or hose to clean off any dirt or debris that’s left on it. Use a dry cleaning rag to dry off the diaphragm and scrub any large pieces of debris that are sticking to it. [10] X Research source If the diaphragm is cracked or worn out, then you can buy a replacement from an irrigation specialist or from most hardware stores. If you had to unscrew the entire valve, then it will have a rubber O-ring around the threading that you can clean or replace. Cleaning the diaphragm may also stop leaks that occur near the sprinkler heads."

Put the top lid back onto the valve and reattach the screws that hold it in place. Turn on the water supply for your irrigation system and watch the valve box to see if it still floods inside. If the box stays dry, then cleaning the diaphragm fixed the leak. [11] X Research source If there is still a leak that occurs inside the valve box, the valve may be faulty and you need to have a professional replace it."

Rotate the spray head counterclockwise to unscrew it from the base and remove the filter. Rinse the filter and sprayer under clean water to remove any clogs or debris before reattaching it to the sprinkler system. Rotate the sprinkler head until the sprayer points at your yard again. While cleaning out the filter won’t fix a leak, it will help prevent them in the future since clogs can cause the water pressure to build and burst a hose connection."

Work slowly and carefully so you don’t break any hoses or pipes by accident, removing at least 6 inches (15 cm) of soil in each direction from the sprinkler. As you start to uncover more of the sprinkler head, use a small hand trowel or your hands to move the dirt and mud away to reveal the valve and hose connection on the bottom. If the ground is wet or muddy from the leak, try to remove as much of the wet mud as you can so the hoses and valves don’t get dirty."

If it does, then rotate it counterclockwise to unscrew it from the bottom of the sprinkler head. Be sure to use a replacement valve that matches the shape and size of the existing valve or else the connection won’t fit. Screw the new valve clockwise onto the bottom of the sprinkler so you can use it again. [13] X Research source You can buy replacement sprinkler valves from irrigation specialists or from hardware stores. If the valve wasn’t broken, then be sure to rinse it off with clean water so none of the mud or dirt gets inside the lines."

Sometimes, the hose will rupture if the sprinkler gets clogged or if the hose is old and damaged. Look for any cracks or broken seams on the end of the hose, and if there are any, then you need to repair the line.

Place the edge of your pipe cutter on the hose and pull the handles together to make a straight cut through it. Only remove as much as you need so you don’t need to attach a new section of hose. Use a cleaning rag to wipe the edges of your cut so no mud or dirt goes through your sprinkler head.

If the valve has threading, then rotate it onto the end of the hose. Otherwise, push the hose as far onto the valve as you’re able so it has a secure fit. You do not need to use any adhesives or pipe cement to hold it in place since the flanges will prevent water from escaping. [16] X Research source If you aren’t able to push the hose onto the valve, dig up another 2–3 inches (5.1–7.6 cm) of the hose so you’re able to maneuver it around better."

If it’s spraying correctly and doesn’t have any pooling water, then the sprinkler is fixed. [18] X Research source If the sprinkler still has an inconsistent spray, you may need to replace the sprinkler head entirely.

Don’t use a lot of force so you don’t accidentally break the hose while you’re digging. Dig out 12 inches (30 cm) horizontally from each side of the hose so you have room to work. Expose the broken section of the hose and 6 inches (15 cm) of excess on each side. [20] X Research source Contact your local utility companies before you start digging to find out if there are any buried power or gas lines in your yard that you should avoid. If you dig up the hose and you still don’t see any damage, then the leak may be draining from a different area of your yard.

Compression couplings are pieces of PVC that connect 2 pieces of hose together with a watertight seal. Make sure to use compression couplings that match the size and diameter of your hose, or else they may leak. Slide the couplings halfway onto the ends of the piece of hose so they don’t move or slip around. Keep pushing the couplings on until it covers about 1–2 inches (2.5–5.1 cm) of the hose’s ends.

Make sure about 1–2 inches (2.5–5.1 cm) of the hose goes into the coupling so it has a tight connection. If you need to, wet the ends of the hose to make it easier to push into the couplings.
