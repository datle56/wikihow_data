      "title": "Choose a clean space for matting.",
      "content": "Choose a clean space for matting. Wipe the space down with a damp cloth and then completely dry it. As you’re going to be using your mat board to display your artwork, you don’t want it to get covered in dirt and grime! You’ll also be using your art to make proper measurements, so it’s extra important to have a clean work space. [1] X Research source Don’t use cleaning solutions or soap to clean your workspace, as these could damage your materials."

      "title": "Measure your artwork and mat border for the total board size.",
      "content": "Measure your artwork and mat border for the total board size. This is going to require some math, so break out your calculator. First, you need to decide how wide you’d like the mat border to be. Next, measure the width and length of your artwork. This will give you the size you need to cut out the window (the cut-out that will display the artwork). Add the window and border measurements for the total mat board size. [2] X Research source If you’re not showing any border or edges on the side of the artwork, you may want to subtract ¼ inch (0.64 cm) from each side (½ inch or 1.27 cm total for both length and width). This will give you a neat edge underneath your mat board. Your mat board should match up in size with your backing. Once you’ve got the mat board measured, use these measurements to size out the backing as well."

      "title": "Mark the outer edges of the mat and backing boards.",
      "content": "Mark the outer edges of the mat and backing boards. Most boards come in standard sizes that will need to be trimmed to fit your artwork. Now that you’ve got your measurements, use a tape measure or ruler and make two light pencil marks in each corner to record them. [3] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Use the back of your frame for measurements.",
      "content": "Use the back of your frame for measurements. If you’re going to frame your matted art, both your backing and the mat boards need to be measured to fit into the frame. Use the back of the frame to make sure you’ve got these measurements right. If your backing and mat boards are too big, you may need to trim down the border size. [4] X Research source Having a frame before you start matting limits your flexibility on sizing the mat board border, so you may want to wait to pick a frame until after everything’s already matted."

    {
      "title": "Use a ruler and pencil to trace your measurements.",
      "content": "Use a ruler and pencil to trace your measurements. Remove your artwork from the backing and mat boards and set it to the side. Use a ruler to make straight lines connecting each of the small marks you just made. You should have two rectangles or squares on your mat board and one on your backing. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Use a straight-edge razor to cut the backing and mat boards.",
      "content": "Use a straight-edge razor to cut the backing and mat boards. Press the razor down firmly at the top corners of the boards. Pull the razor slowly and steadily towards you, stopping at the bottom corner. Keep the same pressure throughout your cut, and be very careful not to dip out or in from the penciled line. [6] X Research source Keeping the line straight is the toughest part of this whole process. It’s also frustrating, because you’ll have to start over if your lines aren’t straight. Use something with a straight edge, such as an old frame or a heavy book, to help you cut."

      "content": "Cut twice so the mat pops out of the window. You shouldn’t need to use any force to remove the cut out, as this could rip the mat board window. Make the cuts at least twice to allow the cut out to simply fall out of the window. Make sure you’re cutting on the exact same lines each time. [7] X Research source You may need to make several cuts to remove the cut out. Do as many as you need to, but take your time. Each repeated cut needs to be on the same line as all the others."

Use something heavy, like a sock filled with coins or a heavy glass, to keep your artwork where you want it. Don’t worry too much if it shifts, though, since you’ve made marks to keep track of the centering."

    {
      "title": "Tape the back of your art to the backing.",
      "content": "Tape the back of your art to the backing. Use linen or archival tape to create what’s called a hinge to attach your window to the backing. Put two pieces of tape in vertical lines on each side of the back of the piece, so the sticky side doesn’t touch the backing. Lay two more pieces of tape horizontally across the vertical pieces (sticky-side down) to adhere the artwork to the backing. Linen and archival tape has the adhesive ability of regular tape, but it won’t damage your artwork or mat board. It’ll cost more than normal tape, but regular household tape contains acids and other chemicals that may eventually leak onto your artwork."

      "title": "Use photo corners or mounting strips to attach your artwork.",
      "content": "Use photo corners or mounting strips to attach your artwork. If you’re using corners, take off the bottom adhesive and place four of them on the backing at each corner of the piece. For see-through mounting strips, use two on each side of the piece, or eight total, and adhere them to the backing. You can then slip the artwork directly under the corners or strips. Photo corners and strips are best for conservation, as they avoid the damage that even linen tape could cause to your piece."

      "title": "Attach the window mat by creating a taped hinge.",
      "content": "Attach the window mat by creating a taped hinge. Lay down the window and the backing flush against each other, with the window face down. Use one long strip of linen tape to connect the window to the backing. Place the tape so one half is on the back of the window and one half is on the backing. Fold them together like you’re closing a book. It’s best to connect the window and backing at the top of the frame. You’re now ready to put this matted print into a frame if you’d like a more finished look. You can also attach an adhesive picture hanger to the back of your backing board to hang the matted frame up on the wall by itself."

      "title": "Purchase equipment if you plan to dry mount.",
      "content": "Purchase equipment if you plan to dry mount. Dry mounting (rather than using tape) is a more involved process. If you want a permanent and extremely stable mount and you don’t mind opening your wallet, go for it! You’ll need a tacking iron, dry mounting and release tissues, and a professional heating press. [10] X Research source Investing in dry mounting equipment may be a great idea if you know you want to consistently mount lots of artwork or photographs. This really will be an investment. Dry mount presses cost a few thousand dollars, and tacking irons may cost between $50-$100. The tissues will be less pricey. Be aware that dry mounting isn’t recommended for older artwork or pieces you’d like to preserve. It’s a permanent, irreversible process, so it’s not the best option for conservation."

It should be heated to about 180℉ (82.22℃). Use a stopwatch to keep track of the time. [16] X Research source For photographs, resin-based paper should only be heated for about 60-90 seconds, while fiber-based papers should be heated for 2-4 minutes. Fiber-based paper is the material that’s more commonly used to print high-quality pictures. [17] X Research source"

Once you remove it from the press, keep it flat by laying it face down underneath something heavy. The artwork needs to be fully cooled before you remove it from under the weight. Test it by lifting one corner and gently touching your finger to the backing. [18] X Research source Use a large coffee-table book or several socks with coins in them if you don’t have a flattening weight specially made for the dry mounting process. Make sure your workspace is still clean before you lay your artwork face down to cool."

This is the stuff that museums use on their collections, so you know it’s high quality. These materials will cost you a little more. However, if you’re matting expensive prints or original artwork, this is the way to go. [19] X Research source"

It’ll also draw observers’ attention to the center of the piece. [21] X Research source Measuring the border will depend on the size of the piece. Your border should measure as wide as at least 25% of the shortest edge. So if your piece is 8 in. by 12 in. (20.32 cm by 30.48 cm), you’ll need a minimum of 2 inches (5.08 cm) for the border. Go up an inch or two (2.54-5.08 cm) to make this a wider border. [22] X Research source"
