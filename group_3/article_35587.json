You can only redeem an eBay gift card when you’re buying something, so first, make sure there’s something you actually want to buy. Once everything you’ll be buying is added to your shopping cart, click “Proceed to cart” (or the cart icon in the upper right corner of your screen) and select “Go to checkout.” [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Sign into your eBay account. Enter your eBay username (or the email address associated with your account) and your eBay password when prompted. If you don’t have an eBay account, make one before trying to use your gift card—it’s required. You can make an account anytime, and it’s free. [2] X Research source While you need an eBay account to use an eBay gift card, you don’t need a PayPal account (which used to be a requirement)."

      "content": "Input the gift card’s 13-digit code on the payment screen. On the checkout screen, scroll down until you see a box labeled “Gift cards and coupons.” In the field below where it says, “Enter code,” type the 13-digit redemption code found on the back of your eBay gift card (or included in the email if you got a digital card). Then, click “Apply” to add the card as a payment method. [3] X Research source Mobile App: The process is nearly identical on eBay's mobile app. Just click the \"Gift cards and coupons\" tab on the checkout page to go to a new screen, where you can enter the 13-digit code and hit \"Apply.\" After this, your order total will be adjusted accordingly. If there’s enough money to cover the entire order, your total will be $0.00. If not, you'll see the remaining balance, and you can add another payment method. Accepted payment methods on eBay include Venmo, PayPal, Google Pay, or a credit card."

Congratulations: you’ve just redeemed your eBay gift card!

If eBay says your gift card’s number is invalid, the first thing to do is double-check the number to ensure you typed in the same code printed on the card. If you type the number incorrectly, it won’t be usable until fixed. However, if you’re still having problems after verifying the number, try contacting the seller you bought the card from.

Per eBay’s policy, you can use as many as 4 gift cards and promotions per order—including eBay bucks and coupons. Ensure you’re not using too many different codes in a single order!

So, if there’s an error message, try placing your order on a different browser. If that doesn’t work, try placing your order on a different device instead. You can also try clearing your browser’s cookies ; this may help fix whatever error is preventing you from using your gift card."

Click “Help & Contact” at the top of your screen on eBay’s website and select “Chat with our automated assistant” under “Contact Us.” [8] X Research source If your problem can’t be solved with the help of the automated bot, eBay will connect you to a customer service agent instead."

Gift cards from eBay don’t expire or come with extra fees, so they’ll work anytime, regardless of when they were originally paid for. Think of your gift card like cash (that can only be spent on eBay): you can use it as long as you have it. [10] X Research source"
