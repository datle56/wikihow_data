      "content": "Protect your skin from the sun. Make-up covers your skin but it doesn't always block harmful UV rays. Put on a 30 FPS sunscreen, use a moisturizer with a sun protection factor or use a tinted moisturizer with a sun protection factor. This is important even if you have a tan. It can help to delay wrinkles later on in life and it prevents protection against some skin cancer."

      "content": "Dab on concealer if your complexion isn't perfect. Many thirteen year olds have lovely skin so don't use concealer just because you think you should. Choose a concealer for under your eyes and another one to cover pimples or blemishes."

      "title": "Wear a bit of eyeshadow.",
      "content": "Wear a bit of eyeshadow. Neutral shades such as brown and coral are especially good for 13 year olds. Apply the lightest shade under your brow bone and in the inner corner of your eyes. Apply the darkest color in your crease, and the second to darkest color on your eyelid. If your eyeshadow flakes off during the day, try investing in an eye primer. Younger girls can get away with cute fun shades so if you want to try sparkly blue or pink eye shadow for a party, go ahead."
