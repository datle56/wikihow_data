It can be used in any situation, but it is most frequently associated with formal situations, strangers, and elders. [1] X Research source The correct pronunciation of the phrase is kom-mohn tay-lay voo.

[2] X Research source This phrase is roughly pronounced, koh-mohn sah vah. Comment means \"how.\" Va is another conjugated form of the verb aller, meaning \"to go.\" On its own, ça is a pronoun meaning \"it.\" A more literal translation would be, \"How does it go?\""
