Because children with dyslexia have difficulty with phonological processing (the manipulation of sounds) and rapid visual-verbal responding, they may exhibit some difficulties in basic learning, including: [8] X Research source Slowness to build their vocabulary. Usually dyslexic pre-school children only say a small number of words. [9] X Research source Slow recall of sounds, letters, colors, and numbers. Dyslexic children may also be slow to name even objects familiar to them. [10] X Research source Difficulty in recognizing their own names.

Difficulty rhyming or reciting nursery rhymes. Difficulty remembering content, even from a favorite video. Note that writing errors are not necessarily indicative of dyslexia in pre-schoolers. Many kindergarteners and first-graders reverse their letters and numbers as they are just learning to write. However, this can be a sign of dyslexia in older children and if the reversal of letters and numbers in writing persists, your child should be tested for dyslexia. [13] X Research source"

Dyslexia among children and young people is usually first recognized when they fall behind their peers in learning to read or in consistently reading below their age level.

[21] X Research source The confusion of small words like “at” and “to” or “does” and “goes”. Consistent reading, spelling, and writing errors, even after being shown the correct forms.

The underlying cause of dyslexia is a problem with phonological processing, the ability to see or hear a word, break it down into discrete sounds, and then associate each sound with the letters that make up the word.

Children and young adults with dyslexia may deliberately try to avoid situations where they have to read, write or speak in a public capacity in front of their peers, teachers, and parents. Be aware that older children in particular often use coping or avoidance strategies. What looks like poor organization or even laziness may be a way to avoid the difficulties associated with dyslexia. [41] X Research source Children and young people may feign illness in order to get out of reading out loud or public speaking for fear of embarrassment. They may also procrastinate on reading and writing assignments in order to put off their struggle for as long as possible."

If you think your child may have dyslexia based on any of the above signs, it is imperative that you consult those who are also invested in your child, like his teacher and his primary care physician. These individuals can help guide you to the right psychological professional so that your child can be formally tested. Early diagnosis is important in helping children learn to cope with dyslexia. Unmet needs in dyslexic children can have dire consequences for these children later in life. Studies have shown that more than one-third of students with dyslexia drop out of high school, which accounts for more than one-quarter of all high school drop-outs.

No one test can diagnose dyslexia. The standard battery of tests includes up to sixteen separate assessments. They examine all aspects of the reading process to see where the difficulties are occurring, compare reading level to reading potential based on intelligence, and test how students are most comfortable absorbing and reproducing information (audibly, visually, or kinetically).
