      "content": "Stop comparing yourself to others. Comparison is a very common thing people do, but it’s unfortunately “one of the most maladaptive (meaning not helpful) things you can do in life,” says Chronister. To try to break the comparison habit, stop scrolling through social media and unfollow accounts that make you feel envious. When you do see another person’s successes, celebrate them and feel joy for their victory (if anything, learn from how they’ve achieved their success!). Avoid criticizing others or looking down on them, especially when it comes from a place of jealousy. Ratson emphasizes the importance of “focusing on the positive qualities you have, learning to appreciate them, and, if you want to compare, compare yourself to your past self…and appreciate how you have improved and appreciate your ability to continue to improve your character and quality of life.” If you’re particularly struggling with body image comparisons, adds Chronister, try to “practice body gratitude and body kindness in general on a weekly or even daily basis, and highlight your strengths that have nothing to do with body shape and type.”"

Start with the list of questions below, and try journaling your unfiltered thoughts and responses. This process may take time, but once you understand the reasons behind your feelings, you’ll be able to accept your past for what it was and begin to move forward.

When did you first start believing those negative things about yourself? Who or what contributed to the formation of those negative beliefs? When those negative thoughts pop into your head, whose voice do you hear them in? What past experiences may have influenced your perception of yourself? How do you feel about yourself when you’re around certain people or in certain situations? What evidence do you have to support your negative beliefs about yourself? What evidence do you have to contradict your negative beliefs about yourself? Are you treating yourself the same way that you would treat a friend going through the same issues?"

To start reframing your negative thoughts, stop every time you’re talking down to yourself. Consider what exactly you’re thinking about yourself, then try to find evidence to support those “claims.” If there’s no evidence, it’s not true. [2] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source If you have to invent some far-fetched, illogical idea to make it true, then it’s still not true! For example, you may have a coworker that you think is so much smarter than you. Ask yourself why you think she’s smarter than you. Does she help you with all your projects? Does she pick up all of your slack at work? If these things aren’t true, then you’re perfectly capable of your job, and your negative claim will be proven untrue. It’s also possible that your coworker is slightly smarter than you in certain ways—that’s okay, too! There are probably traits of yourself that she wishes she had, and there’s more than one way to be intelligent."

Practicing self-acceptance can help you internalize the knowledge that you are uniquely you and uniquely beautiful. Nobody’s perfect, so even when you realize that you have flaws, that’s not the end of the world! Everyone has flaws, and embracing yours prevents you from being ruled by them. Try making a list of all your perceived flaws in a journal. Next to each one, write what you think would happen if people knew you had this flaw. [3] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source Then, write down whether this flaw is really worth disliking yourself over. You may ask yourself whether or not you’d start feeling negatively toward a friend if they had the same flaw. Chances are that most (if not all) of your flaws are not as important as you think they are. Remember that self-acceptance is a slow process. Ratson emphasizes the importance of small steps in recognizing “your qualities and values and showing appreciation for what you have…once you’re able to tap into your inner resources, slowly and gradually you’re able to develop that self-confidence.”"

Turn to this journal when you’re feeling down on yourself, and take a moment to appreciate your life and how far you’ve come. Ratson highlights the importance of accepting who you are and being “grateful for what you have. While you, like others, are not perfect, embrace the fact that you’re perfectly imperfect.
