      "content": "Pour in about 2 in (5.1 cm) of water in the bottom pan. Set up a double boiler on your stove. Add enough water to the bottom pan to fill it about 50% of the way full. A double boiler is a special set of pans that neatly nest on a stovetop burner. Using a double boiler prevents ingredients from getting scorched. [1] X Research source If you don’t have a double boiler, use a large stockpot and a small saucepan, metal bowl, or thick glass bowl. The smaller dish must be small enough to rest on the top of the larger stockpot without the bottom of it sitting in the water."

Leave at least 1 to 2 in (2.5 to 5.1 cm) of empty headspace at the top of the dish to reduce the risk of overflow.

      "content": "Bring the water to a boil as you stir the liquid you're pasteurizing. Use a spoon to stir the contents in the top of your double boiler over the boiling water. This reduces the risk of the liquid getting too hot, burning, or curdling. If any skin forms while the liquid heats, remove it with a ladle or spoon."

      "content": "Heat the liquid you're pasteurizing at 162 °F (72 °C) for 15 seconds. Check the liquid’s temperature by inserting a thermometer into it. Be sure to only insert the tip of the thermometer about two-thirds deep into the liquid—don’t rest it on the bottom or sides of the dish. [4] X Research source Alternative: Pasteurize the food or liquid at 150 °F (66 °C) for 30 minutes as an alternative. While this option takes longer, there's a lower chance of cooking the food or liquid. Insert a thermometer into the liquid so it's submerged about two-thirds deep and doesn't touch the bottom or sides of the double boiler. Make sure the temperature never drops below 150 °F (66 °C) for at least 30 minutes. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Transfer the saucepan to a cold water bath to cool it down. The easiest way to do this is to set it in your sink and fill it up with cold water. Add a tray of ice cubes to the water to cool the pan down even quicker. Allow it to sit in the cold water until the liquid is 68 °F (20 °C) or cooler. [6] X Research source You can also use a large basin, bowl, or pot for this step."

[13] X Research source Aim to drink the pasteurized milk within 2 weeks (or in 1 week. [14] X Research source Or, drink it in 1 week if you’re pasteurizing cider). [15] X Research source Note: The double boiler method is the standard, most widely-accepted method for at-home pasteurization. In one specific study, the direct heat method was proven effective in pasteurizing milk , but it wasn’t tested on other fluids/foods—so, you’re better off using it for just milk."

They should be able to stand upright without knocking into each other. Make sure that your pot is big enough to fit all your storage containers. While some people try to sterilize jars in a dishwasher, it doesn't guarantee sterilization the way that boiling containers does."

Put enough water into the stockpot to completely cover the storage containers so they are heated evenly. Set the stockpot on the stove once it is full. It’s best to arrange the containers inside of the stockpot before bringing the water to a boil. Glass tends to crack or otherwise break when exposed to rapid changes in temperature, so submerging the jars after the water has already reached a boil can be risky."

Slightly warm containers are less likely to break during pasteurization."
