      "content": "Submerge your cotton sweatshirt in boiling water to shrink the fabric. If your sweatshirt did not shrink enough after using hot water, boil a large pot of water on high heat. When your water comes to a boil, submerge your garments, put a lid on the pot, and turn off the heat. The boiling water helps shrink your shirt even more. [4] X Research source If you want to shrink your shirt 1 size, leave it in the water for 10-15 minutes. If you hope to shrink your shirt 2 sizes, let it cool to room temperature. Do not do this if washing a polyester sweatshirt. The high temperatures can make the fabric rough or stiff. Polyester should not be heated above 178 °F (81 °C). Alternatively, put your sweatshirt in your sink and pour boiling water over top the garment. Then, let it cool to room temperature."
