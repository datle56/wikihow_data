A radian is the measure of an angle. Each measurement will be in pi, since a circle’s circumference is based on pi. The radians of a unit circle go from 0 to 2𝛑. Most angles on your circle will be a fraction of pi. Here are the radian measurements for the first quadrant: [7] X Research source 0 degree angles have a measurement of 0. A 30 degree angle has a measurement of 𝛑/6. A 45 degree angle has a measurement of 𝛑/4. A 60 degree angle has a measurement of 𝛑/3. A 90 degree angle has a measurement of 𝛑/2."

However, the coordinates for sine and cosine will be the same integer, though they may shift from positive to negative. That means you can use your left hand trick to find the coordinates in any quadrant! Here’s how to label your fingers: [13] X Research source Use your pinky to represent a 0 degree angle. The 0 degree angle falls on your x-axis. It’s the starting point of your circle, which is why it’s 0. Your ring finger represents a 30 degree angle. Let your middle finger represent a 45 degree angle. Your index finger represents a 60 degree angle. Make your thumb represent the 90 degree angle."

Count the number of fingers to the left of the finger that represents your angle. Then, take the square root of this number and divide it by 2 to find your coordinates. [14] X Research source For example, if you were finding the coordinates for a 30 degree angle, you’d put down your ring finger. To the left of that finger, you have your thumb, index finger, and middle finger, which means 3 fingers. This means the cosine coordinate is 3 2 {\\displaystyle {\\frac {\\sqrt {3}}{2}}} . This is your final answer since you can't simplify the fraction any further. If you were getting the cosine for a 0 degree angle, you’d put down your pinkie and count 4 fingers to the left. Your equation is 4 2 {\\displaystyle {\\frac {\\sqrt {4}}{2}}} . Since the square root of 4 is 2, you’d solve 2/2=1. This is your cosine."

That means your sine coordinate would be 1 2 {\\displaystyle {\\frac {\\sqrt {1}}{2}}} . Since the square root of 1 is 1, you can just write 1/2. For your 0 degree angle, you’d see that there are no fingers to the right of your pinky. This means your sine must be 0."
