      "content": "Pretreat fresh stains with cold water. In many cases, if the perfume or cologne stain is still fresh, you may be able to lift all or most of it with cold water. Simply dip a clean cloth into the water and gently dab the stain, starting from the center and working your way out. It may help to add a bit of laundry detergent or vinegar to the stain, as well. [1] X Research source If this step removes the stain, go ahead and launder the garment as usual. If not, continue to the next step. This method works best on fabrics like cotton, linen, nylon, polyester, spandex, or wool. It’s important to use cold water, as warm water may set the stain further. Not all fabrics can get wet. Weston reminds us to “check the manufacturer’s label for specific care instructions because some materials can be treated with water, while others may require special cleaning products.” [2] X Expert Source Elias Weston Cleaning Specialist Expert Interview. 30 January 2021."

      "title": "Make a detergent-based cleaning solution for set-in stains.",
      "content": "Make a detergent-based cleaning solution for set-in stains. If the stain is set-in, it may require a stronger stain removal method. Mix a solution of 1 quart (0.9 L) water, 1/2 tsp (2.46 ml) of gentle detergent (laundry detergent or dish soap usually works well), and 1 tbsp (14 ml) of white vinegar. Soak the garment in the solution for about 15 minutes, then rinse. [3] X Research source If the stain remains, sponge on a bit of rubbing alcohol, rinse the garment thoroughly, and then launder. Another option is to treat stubborn stains with water and baking soda. Mix 1 part water with 1 part baking soda and allow the fabric to soak for 10-15 minutes. Then, launder as usual."

      "content": "Wash the garment as you normally would. After pretreating the stain, go ahead and wash your clothes, following the instructions on their care label. If it’s safe for the fabric, add some chlorine bleach to add in the stain removal. [4] X Research source Allow your clothes to air dry unless you’re 100% certain the stain is gone. Heat can set stains and make them permanent, which is why it’s best to avoid using the dryer. If the stain remains after you wash it, apply some laundry detergent directly to the stain and let it sit for 5 minutes before washing it again."

      "title": "Treat silk or triacetate with glycerin.",
      "content": "Treat silk or triacetate with glycerin. Flush the fabric as best you can with cold water. Then, add a few drops of glycerin to the stain, making sure to cover it completely. This will help soften stains so they can be removed. Run the fabric under water and rinse well, gently wiping the stain with your finger. After rinsing, most or all of the staining should be removed. Flush the garment one more time to remove any cleaning agents, then hang it to dry. [5] X Research source Silk and triacetate are not very absorbent materials, so it may be difficult to soak the fabric completely. If the glycerin doesn’t fully remove the stain, blot it with a 1:1 ratio of water and white vinegar. Alternatively, add a couple drops of denatured alcohol to a cheesecloth pad or sponge and dab the stain. Denatured alcohol is poisonous when ingested, so be extremely careful when using it. Store it out of reach of children. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Clean leather or suede with mild soap and water. Fill a large bowl halfway with lukewarm water, then mix in a squirt of mild liquid soap (like dish soap), agitating the water so it foams. Blot up any excess perfume with a clean paper towel, then scoop the foam onto a sponge and pat the suds onto the stain. Wipe the soap away with a dry paper towel and check to see if the stain is gone. If any remains, rub it with a soft, dry cloth. Remember to apply a leather conditioner once the stain is gone. [7] X Research source Never use water on leather or suede—be very careful to apply the soap suds only. If the stain is still visible after applying the suds, another option is to sprinkle some cornmeal onto the stain. Let it sit for about half an hour, then use a dry, stiff-bristled brush to remove it. Repeat the process as needed until the stain has been completely absorbed and removed."

      "title": "Clean carpet or upholstery with a dish soap and glycerin solution.",
      "content": "Clean carpet or upholstery with a dish soap and glycerin solution. This works on blended fibers, fiberglass, natural and synthetic fibers, and wool. Blot up any excess perfume with an absorbent cloth or paper towel. Spray the stain with a commercial fabric spot cleaner, then mix a solution of 1 part glycerin, 1 part dishwashing detergent, and 8 parts water. Apply the solution to the stain sparingly, then dampen an absorbent pad with the solution and press it on the stain. Then, sponge the carpet or upholstery clean with water and allow it to air dry. This also works for other grease and oil stains. [8] X Research source Be sure to test any cleaning methods in an inconspicuous area to make sure they won’t damage your carpet. If the stain persists, try using a general household cleaner like 409 or Fantastik , or sponge the stain with some rubbing alcohol. Flush the carpet with water and allow it to dry. If you want to make your own multi-purpose cleaner, Weston says, “An easy and very effective multi-purpose cleaner can be made with just 3 ingredients—water, vinegar, and Dawn dishwashing liquid. Simply mix 2 cups (473 ml) of warm water with ¼ cup (59 ml) of vinegar and 1 tsp (5 ml) Dawn dish soap, and add it to a spray bottle.” [9] X Expert Source Elias Weston Cleaning Specialist Expert Interview. 30 January 2021."

Weston says, “To properly steam clean your home, begin by vacuuming all of the surfaces you will be steam cleaning. Once you’ve vacuumed, pretreat any heavy stains with a cleaning solution. Most stains can be removed during the steam cleaning process, but if there [are] heavy stains, it’s a good idea to pretreat them to make them easier to remove.” [10] X Expert Source Elias Weston Cleaning Specialist Expert Interview. 30 January 2021. Follow your steam cleaner’s guidelines to use it properly."

      "content": "Air out the clothes. If possible, hang the clothing or fabric outside in the fresh air. Otherwise, hang it in a warm, sunlit room and turn on a fan. Depending on how saturated it is with the scent, it may take anywhere from a few hours to a few weeks to completely air out. [11] X Research source Plants can help absorb odor, so try hanging the garment around some houseplants if you have them!"

Add at least 1/4 cup (59 ml) of distilled white vinegar to the rinse cycle, then stop the cycle. Let the laundry soak for an hour before completing the rinse cycle. [13] X Research source The vinegar will help remove the perfume residue from the item’s fibers. If you want, add an extra rinse cycle to ensure all the detergent is removed from your clothing."

      "title": "Dry and air out the clothes again.",
      "content": "Dry and air out the clothes again. Rather than tossing your clothes in the dryer, hang them on a clothesline or use a drying rack in the fresh air. Allow them to dry completely, and check to make sure the smell is gone. If it isn’t, repeat the process as many times as needed. [14] X Research source While sunlight can help remove odors, it can sometimes fade fabrics, so hang dark colors in the shade. If you must use a dryer, use a low-temperature setting, as heat may cause the odor to set more deeply into the fabric."

      "content": "Test perfumes on scrap fabric to see if they stain. Not all fragrances stain, but there’s not really a way to tell until you try them out. If possible, find a piece of scrap fabric made from the same material as the garments you intend to wear and spray them with the perfume. Wait a while to see if a stain sets in, as they aren’t always visible right away. [15] X Research source If you don’t have scrap fabric, try spraying the fragrance on an old T-shirt or something you don’t mind staining. Alternatively, test the fragrance on the garment you intend to wear by spraying it in an inconspicuous area, like under the arm. Note that perfume stains are more noticeable on white shirts and other light fabrics."

      "title": "Spray your fragrance before getting dressed.",
      "content": "Spray your fragrance before getting dressed. Try applying your perfume or cologne directly onto your skin so it doesn’t get on your clothes. One of the best ways to prevent perfume stains is to spray the fragrance on your neck or wrists and then let it dry completely before getting dressed. This helps prevent the oils in the perfume from soaking into the fabric and staining it. [16] X Research source Fragrances typically last longer if applied to the skin rather than clothes, too!"

      "title": "Apply the fragrance from a distance.",
      "content": "Apply the fragrance from a distance. If you’re already dressed, try to spray your perfume or cologne farther away from your body (about 5 inches or 12 cm from the skin) rather than right by your clothes. This way, the fragrance mist will be more spread out, so the oils won’t saturate your clothes in just one spot, potentially creating stains. [17] X Research source"

      "content": "Some perfumes and colognes stain clothes. Not all fragrances stain clothes, but some can, depending on the ingredients (like alcohol, oils, and dyes) they contain. [18] X Research source These ingredients may interact with the fibers of your clothes and leave behind a stain. These stains may not be visible right away, as they often darken over time. Fragrances are more likely to stain white clothes than other colors. Perfumes and colognes usually stain fabrics because they contain oils. Fragrances have many ingredients, like alcohol, fragrance oils, and even dyes. [19] X Research source These ingredients may react with different fabrics and leave oily stains behind. A perfume that might stain one type of fabric may not stain another, depending on its composition."
