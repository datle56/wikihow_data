You can utilize a trimmer to manage (or even, dare we say, sculpt) your growth, or use a razor and take the whole of it completely off. It’s a common misconception that shaving body hair will make it grow back thicker, coarser, darker, faster, and more plentiful, but this is not the case. [2] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Shaving cuts the hair, resulting in a blunter tip for the hair (which causes it to feel coarser), but this is not permanent and has no lasting effecting on the follicle."

      "content": "Trim electrically. Electric hair trimmers designed specifically for body hair are optimal if you just want to keep your chest hair under control. You should shower before doing any trimming, making sure to scrub your chest clean, and then try out your trimmer once you’re dry. Trimmers come with multiple guards. Don’t be afraid of starting with a longer guard (usually a higher number), then switching to increasingly shorter guards until you find the right length. Always begin shaving in the same direction as the grain of your hair, and then try running the trimmer against the grain of your hair. If irritation occurs when going against the grain, discontinue for a few days. Although not necessary, many men prefer to use aftershave or moisturizer afterward to soothe the skin. Subsequent trims will help you figure out how short you'd like to go, as you'll quickly become aware of the rate of your hair growth and how much upkeep you can handle."

Take care around sensitive areas—two obvious ones being your nipples—and run your razor in the same direction that your hair grows. Apply aftershave to soothe your irritated skin, if necessary. When you opt to take it clean off, however, you're also granted the \"joy\" of maintaining that perfectly smooth chest. There hasn't been a study yet finding chest hair regrowth stubble to be anybody's idea of attractive, and it can be itchy and painful for you while it grows back. Aloe vera can soothe the itch, but you'll have to regularly shave to avoid unsightly stubble. [3] X Research source"

For best results lay it on in the direction your hair grows. [5] X Research source Some products use all-in-one applicator strips with wax, whereas others (generally referred to as “hard” waxes) will come with a spatula-like tool for spreading it on. Your hair needs to be as close to a quarter-inch long as you can get it for the wax to grab hold. If you’re trying wax after a bungled trimming you might need to give your hair a few days to grow, and if you've got an unruly thicket on there you should use a trimmer (or scissors) to cut your chest hair in preparation. Usually, the longer the hair, the better."

If you’re using hard wax, you’ll want to quickly pull it off once it has hardened enough to be firm, yet still flexible. Remove it in the direction opposite to your hair growth for best results. After pulling, apply immediate pressure for pain relief. Different products will recommend different specifics, but care should generally be taken not to re-wax the same area unless specifically instructed to. Unlike shaving, waxing is removing your hair from the root. It will generally give you a longer-lasting hairlessness (3-6 weeks), but also opens the door to ingrown hairs. [6] X Research source Avoid using soap or scented products on your chest for 24 hours after waxing, to avoid irritation."

Electrolysis is a procedure utilizing an incredibly slim needle, which essentially delivers small shocks of electricity to each individual hair follicle.

Those who use pacemakers, for example, cannot undergo electrolysis for risk of it interfering with the device. [9] X Research source"
