      "title": "Unexplained injuries",
      "content": "Unexplained injuries It’s normal for infants and toddlers to get a few bumps and bruises while they curiously explore their surroundings. However, if a child you know is coming to you with numerous severe injuries, that’s a major reason to be concerned. This can include things like burns, bites, bruises, broken bones, or black eyes. Marks from abuse often appear in places where children don’t normally get hurt, such as their back, buttocks, torso, or thighs. [1] X Research source Take note if the injuries seem to be oddly shaped, such as bruises that resemble a person’s hand or footprint. Keep in mind that some forms of physical discipline, like mild spankings, are not necessarily abuse. The child might also wear heavy clothing even in the hottest weather to try and hide their abused body. So look for that sign of physical abuse. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Fear of home and/or caregivers",
      "content": "Fear of home and/or caregivers An infant or toddler who has been abused by someone at home may not want to go home. They may avoid their parents or other caregivers—for instance, by forcefully clinging to a teacher at preschool when it’s time to go home. [3] X Research source Mild separation anxiety is common among infants and toddlers and does not necessarily indicate abuse. Keep in mind that just because a child seems afraid of their caregiver, it doesn’t automatically mean that that caregiver is being abusive. If there’s a problem, someone else at home may be the cause. Not wanting to go home is normal if the child is in a place they consider fun. However, if the place isn't somewhere they find particularly fun, or if they seem more fearful than sad or angry, or if it happens all the time, it might be a sign."

    {
      "title": "Sudden changes in behavior",
      "content": "Sudden changes in behavior It’s common for an abused child to suddenly act differently. For example, you might notice that a normally active and outgoing toddler has become much more withdrawn or quiet. Or if they are normally very gentle but have suddenly become aggressive, this might be a sign that they’re being abused. Sudden anxiety, fear, and/or depression are also key signs. [4] X Research source For example, a child you know might have really liked playing outside, but now they’re very afraid when you suggest going out. Infants and young toddlers can also show changes in behavior. For example, they may become overly fussy without any explainable cause. This might also be a sign of some other trauma that isn't abuse. If you don't know which it is, perhaps get a child psychologist's opinion."
    },
    {
      "title": "Obsession with trauma and violence",
      "content": "Obsession with trauma and violence If a child has been the victim of abuse, it’s unlikely that they’ll be able to fully understand what has happened to them. As a result, they may talk a lot about violent or traumatic events, or about hurting themselves or others. They may also become very aggressive with other people. [5] X Research source For example, if you’ve noticed a child talking a lot about wanting to hurt other kids or suddenly becoming obsessed with violent games, this might be a sign of abuse. If you work at the child’s school or daycare and notice them suddenly fighting with other kids or bullying them, it’s a good idea to step in and ask the child why they’re behaving so aggressively."

    {
      "title": "Changes in eating habits",
      "content": "Changes in eating habits It’s natural for infants and toddlers to sometimes be picky eaters. However, if the child seems to have significantly changed how they eat without a clear cause (such as experiencing a growth spurt or being sick), this might be a sign they’ve been abused. Changes in eating caused by stress, anxiety, or fear may cause them to stop eating or to overeat. A noticeable sign is if they gain or lose a lot of weight in a relatively short period of time. [6] X Research source Child abuse can also sometimes lead to children developing eating disorders, due to children who are abused are constantly being shamed and they may develop body image issues because of it. Signs a child has an eating disorder are believing themselves to be too fat, trying to make themselves throw up (especially after eating), eating a lot more or a lot less than usual (without some clear other cause like a growth spurt), unusual behaviour around food (such as cutting it into small pieces), wanting to eat alone, seeming stressed around mealtime, seeming malnourished, and other psychological distress such as depression or anxiety attacks. If your child shows signs of an eating disorder, regardless of whether it was caused by abuse, seek professional help immediately."

      "title": "Problems sleeping",
      "content": "Problems sleeping An infant who normally sleeps through the night may begin to wake up multiple times throughout the night. Or, a toddler may talk about having nightmares frequently. These are both signs of possible abuse. Another symptom is being more tired during the day and not having a lot of energy. [7] X Research source Nightmares are more common among younger children than older people, but if it's happening more than usual, or if the nightmares have a recurring theme and/or keep the child awake, it might mean some kind of trauma (whether abuse or a different kind of trauma)."

      "title": "Early sexual awareness or knowledge",
      "content": "Early sexual awareness or knowledge It’s totally normal for a child to be curious about things like how babies are made and the differences between boys and girls. However, if a toddler seems to know a lot about sex at such a young age, or if they talk about it frequently, this may be a red flag suggesting they’ve been sexually abused. [8] X Research source For example, it’s concerning if a child is explaining sexual acts in graphic detail."

      "content": "Difficulty walking or sitting A child that has been sexually abused may experience some physical trauma as a result. If you notice that a child is having trouble walking or sitting, or if they complain about pain when they do so, it’s reasonable to suspect sexual abuse. [9] X Research source Another sign is if a child complains about pain or itching in their genital area. This might also mean a UTI or a yeast infection, but it could be abuse if it's paired with other signs.

      "content": "Reluctance to change in front of others If a child has suffered from sexual abuse, they might be afraid of changing or taking off their clothes in front of you or other people. Or you might notice that they’re afraid of one specific person. For example, they may outright refuse to change, or a young child might cry or throw a tantrum. [11] X Research source"

      "content": "Fear of physical touch If you notice that a child shies away when you try to hug them or touch them in any other way, this could be a cause for concern. Of course, some children just aren’t too fond of physical touch. But if you notice a dramatic change, such as your child demanding hugs every night and suddenly stopping one day, this might be a sign that they’ve been abused. Another example would be if a toddler or infant starts crying when you approach them or try to touch them.

      "title": "Falling back into outgrown behaviors",
      "content": "Falling back into outgrown behaviors Abuse can make children feel insecure, and they may begin acting younger than their age. For example, a potty-trained child may begin to wet the bed again, or they may start sucking their thumb again despite having stopped a long time ago. [13] X Research source hhttps://www.childsafety.gov.au/about-child-sexual-abuse/signs-and-indicators-child-sexual-abuse This is a very common sign of emotional abuse, and other types of abuse as well, that you should definitely not ignore. This kind of behavior mainly happens in younger children. Other examples include a sudden fear of the dark or strangers, memory problems, and a loss of acquired language skills (going from full sentences to broken phrases, forgetting words, etc.). Regression could also be a response to a different kind of trauma, or to a change in the child's life. Children usually regress because of some sort of stress, and they regress back to a time where they felt happier and safer. This is why a child who has been abused might start sucking their thumb again like they had done when they were younger."

      "title": "Overly compliant or demanding behavior",
      "content": "Overly compliant or demanding behavior Infants and toddlers are both naturally interested in pleasing adults and testing boundaries. However, children who have been abused may go to one extreme or another. You might notice that a child only wants to do what adults say, or they may be constantly defiant or demanding towards you. [14] X Research source For example, if a child throws a tantrum every time you ask them to do something, this may be a reason to worry. On the other hand, a child who easily submits whenever you ask them to do something might also be a cause for concern, especially if they seem afraid of you."

      "title": "Lack of attachment to a parent or guardian",
      "content": "Lack of attachment to a parent or guardian Infants and toddlers often share a rather deep emotional attachment with their parents or guardians. However, children who have been abused by their caregivers might act distant from or apathetic toward them. For example, when their caregiver comes to pick them up at daycare, you may notice that the child doesn’t run to them excitedly as other children might. The child may also avoid being touched by their caregiver and may not turn to them when they’re upset. [15] X Research source"

      "title": "Delays in physical or emotional development",
      "content": "Delays in physical or emotional development A child being emotionally abused by someone may show slower signs of development than what is considered normal. They may hit certain developmental milestones later than others, and may regress easily. For example, you may notice that a toddler still isn’t walking even at 2 years old. They may also have trouble speaking and forming full sentences. Another sign is if they aren’t easily pacified when having a tantrum. [16] X Research source They may also experience regressions. This might also be a sign of a disability or an alternate neurotype (for instance, late walking might mean they need a wheelchair, or trouble speaking might mean they're autistic)."

      "title": "Frequent absences from school or daycare",
      "content": "Frequent absences from school or daycare If a child is constantly absent from daycare or school with no clear cause, like being sick or on vacation, it’s possible that their caregiver is neglecting them. If you work at their daycare or school, you may notice that they also begin to behave differently, such as becoming more withdrawn or aggressive with other children or teachers. [17] X Research source Whether you’re a concerned parent or a staff worker, don’t hesitate to ask the child’s caregiver what the reason for their absence was. Ask in a polite but direct way by saying something like, “We haven’t seen Tommy in a while. Is everything alright?” Take note if the caregiver seems reluctant to talk about the situation or if they lie about it. For example, they may say, \"We went to visit his grandparents on the other side of the country,\" even though you know their grandparents live in the same city. This is a good reason to be suspicious."

If you notice that a child’s caregiver isn’t around and they often leave their child unsupervised, this might be a red flag signaling neglect. Be wary if they seem to be leaving a child outside to play by themself without any supervision, leaving them home alone for a long period of time, or not attending to a crying infant right away. [22] X Research source If you think the child has been left in a potentially dangerous situation, don’t hesitate to call your local child protective services or the police."

If you sound too serious, the child may be scared and become unwilling to share. Take notes about what the child says to present as evidence later when you make your report. If your child tells you they’ve been abused, never just brush it off and never assume that they are lying. Kids rarely lie about being abused if they actually aren’t. In fact, the opposite more often happens. A lot of times, children who are abused try to cover it up and not tell anyone."
