      "title": "Identify your valve type.",
      "content": "Identify your valve type. There are 3 types of valve connections, and your project's level of difficulty depends on how the valve connects to the water supply line. A threaded valve screws directly onto the water supply line and is easy to replace. In a compression connection, the valve screws into a hexagonal nut that fits around the supply line. The most difficult type to replace is a sweat valve, which is soldered onto the supply pipe. [1] X Research source If you see a hexagonal (6-sided) nut, you'll know you have a compression valve. A threaded valve will have 2 to 6 flat sides where it meets the supply line. These flat sides allow you to remove the valve with a pipe wrench. If you have a sweat valve, you'll be able to see where the valve body is soldered, or melted, into the water supply line. You can cut off a soldered sweat valve and replace it with a compression fitting as long as the remaining supply line is long enough to hold the new valve's compression nut and sleeve."

      "content": "Call a professional if your supply line is old or corroded. Regardless of your valve type, some jobs are better left to a professional plumber. If you have an older home with original plumbing, it's wise to have a professional replace valves. If you remove the valve and find that the pipe is internally rusted or threads are rotted, have a plumber install a replacement supply pipe. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Purchase a valve that fits the supply lines.",
      "content": "Purchase a valve that fits the supply lines. The new valve needs to fit the main supply pipe and the lines to any fixtures (such as a sink or toilet) it feeds. If you're not confident that you can find the right size, remove the old valve, bring it to the hardware store, and ask an employee to help you find a match. [3] X Research source"

Before you replace your valve, you'll need to locate your main valve and shut off the water supply. After shutting off the water, turn on the faucets on each level of your home to drain remaining water from the system. [5] X Research source If you need to replace your home's main valve, call your utility company and have them shut off your lot valve. [6] X Research source"

Ensure that the water supply is off before removing the valve. Affix a pipe wrench to the 6-sided nut that holds the valve body in place. Rotate it counter-clockwise to loosen it from the valve body. [16] X Research source The compression nut is a ring that fits around the pipe. After loosening it from the valve body, you can slide it down the pipe shaft and remove the valve. You'll follow this step only if your existing valve uses a compression fitting. If you're replacing a threaded or sweat valve with a compression valve, you'll need to cut the soldered or threaded end of the pipe before you install the new valve."

Locate the compression sleeve, which is a ring that fits snugly at the end of the pipe. Use pliers to carefully rotate it and remove it from the pipe, then slide off the compression nut. [17] X Research source Don't use too much pressure with the pliers. If you warp the pipe, it won't receive the new valve."

If you're replacing a sweat or threaded valve with a compression valve, use a hacksaw to cut off the soldered or threaded end of the pipe. Cut slowly and carefully to avoid warping the pipe. Sand away rough edges with emery cloth when you've finished cutting. Make sure you leave enough pipe to hold the new fitting. Depending on the size of your new valve, you'll probably need at least 2 inches (5.1 cm)."
