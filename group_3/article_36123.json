      "content": "Rinse lightweight fabrics with cold water. If you act fast enough, this is often the easiest way to get fresh blood stains out of fabric. Hold the stained area taut under cold running water until the stain comes out. Even if it doesn’t come out entirely, running the fabric under water can help prevent the stain from setting further and will make it easier to remove later on. [1] X Research source Do not use hot water, as the heat will cause the blood to set in the fabric. This method can work for any washable fabric, though you’ll likely have the most success if it’s a lightweight fabric, like underwear or pajama bottoms. If you’re in public, go to a bathroom as soon as possible to rinse the stain. Then, rub some soap on the area. This may be enough to get small stains out entirely, or it can help prevent the stain from setting until you get a chance to clean it properly."

      "content": "Use hydrogen peroxide on most fabrics. Hydrogen peroxide can stain some fabrics, so test an inconspicuous area first. If it doesn’t discolor the garment, soak a sponge or cloth in the peroxide and lightly dab the stain, working from the outside in. Then, run the fabric under cold water, and repeat the process until the stain is completely removed. [2] X Research source Hydrogen peroxide is the best option for both white clothing and colored clothing. It’s also okay to pour a bit of hydrogen peroxide directly onto the stain. Alternatively, soak the entire garment in a bowl of hydrogen peroxide for 15-20 minutes, then rinse in cold water. If you’re treating delicate fabrics, first dilute the peroxide with 50% water, and take care not to let the foam spread outside of the original stain area. Once the stain is gone, wash the fabric as you normally would in cold water. Allow it to air dry, as heat from the dryer can set the stain if any remains. Hydrogen peroxide is also a great way to remove dried blood stains."

Then, apply liquid laundry detergent (or gentle dish soap) directly to the stain and massage it in. Let it sit for 10 minutes, then rinse and repeat as necessary until the stain is removed. Wash the garment as usual, and allow it to air dry. [3] X Research source If the detergent doesn’t do the trick, try using an enzyme cleaner instead. When washing linen, Weston says, “If machine washing, make sure it is on the gentle cycle, and if being washed with other items, make sure they are of similar quality, size, and color. If hand washing, never twist or scrub the linen. Use gentle washing motions and a mild detergent. Never use bleach on linen.” [4] X Expert Source Elias Weston Cleaning Specialist Expert Interview. 30 January 2021."

Boil an additional cup (236 ml) of water and 2 tbsps (36 g) of table salt on the stove until the salt dissolves. Allow the mixture to cool, then transfer it to a spray bottle. Remove the garment from the bowl of water and spray the stain with the salt water. Let it sit for 10 minutes, then massage the garment under cold water until the stain disappears. Once the stain is gone, wash the garment as you normally would and allow it to air dry. Alternatively, mix a little water with salt to create a paste and rub it directly onto the stain. The abrasiveness of the salt will help loosen the stain and draw it out of the fibers."

      "content": "Rub saliva on small stains. It may sound gross, but saliva contains enzymes that can help break down the proteins in blood. If you don’t have access to any other cleaning methods, spit on the blood-stained area and rub the saliva into the fabric until the stain comes out. Then, rinse the garment in cold water and wash as you normally would. [7] X Research source This works best for small stains, as it may be difficult to gather enough saliva to remove large ones. Using saliva is also a good option for delicate fabrics that may not be able to tolerate harsh cleaning methods."

Apply the paste directly to the blood stain and let it sit for at least 30 minutes (and up to overnight). Then, launder the garment as usual. [8] X Research source Weston recommends baking soda and dish soap to pretreat tough stains: “Soak a clean cloth in cold water, and gently blot the area. Then, make a paste by thoroughly mixing 1/2 cup of baking soda with ¼ cup of liquid dish soap and 4 cups of water. Using a clean cloth, dip it into the foamy solution and soak the affected area. Take another clean, dry cloth and blot the area to lift the stain from the upholstery. Alternate between saturating the area with the baking soda solution and blotting with the clean cloth until the stain is gone.” [9] X Expert Source Elias Weston Cleaning Specialist Expert Interview. 30 January 2021."

      "content": "Pretreat dried blood stains with an enzyme-based stain remover. One of the most common ways to remove dried blood stains is to presoak the garment with an enzyme cleaner. Fill a sink, bucket, or bowl with water and add a teaspoon of an enzyme cleaner of your choice. Soak the garment in the solution for at least 3 or 4 hours. If the stain is still visible at that point, add a bit more cleaner and scrub it into the fabric with a toothbrush. Then, wash the garment as you normally would with cold water. [10] X Research source If the stain is still there after you wash it, repeat the process. It may take a few soaks before it is completely removed. Another option is to rewash the garment using a bleach safe for fabric. Do not mix bleach with any other cleaning products. Do not put the fabric in the dryer until the stain is completely gone, as the heat will only set it further. Weston says, “If the stain is old, try to remove as much of the dry, excess material with a soft-bristled toothbrush [first].” [11] X Expert Source Elias Weston Cleaning Specialist Expert Interview. 30 January 2021."

Place the stained area in a bowl of cold water and sprinkle enough meat tenderizer onto the stain to create a paste. Let it sit for about 30 minutes, then rinse with cold water, and wash as you normally would. [14] X Research source For particularly tough stains, let the tenderizer sit for up to 24 hours, massaging it into the fabric every few hours. This method is best used to clean sturdy fabric like jeans, but not delicate fabrics like linen, silk, or wool. These fabrics are made of proteins, which the meat tenderizer breaks down."

Most of the stain removal methods used for clothing will also work on mattresses , but because they can’t go in the wash, try to go easy on the liquids. Dab a small amount of your preferred stain remover onto the blood stain with a clean cloth or cotton ball. Then, let it dry completely. It may take several applications before the stain is removed entirely. [16] X Research source For fresh stains, try dabbing a bit of cold water to flush the stain. Don’t rub, as this will only make the stain worse. If the stain remains, try sprinkling a bit of baking soda on top and letting it sit for 30 minutes. For dried stains, try dabbing a bit of hydrogen peroxide directly onto the stain, then let it sit for about 5 minutes before blotting it with a paper towel."

Because bedsheets and comforters can be made of different fabrics, it’s important to check their care tag before choosing a stain removal method. In general, cotton or linen sheets can handle the same solutions as clothes, but silk sheets often need a gentler touch. Try dabbing the blood stain with a bit of white vinegar—this method is usually gentle enough to use on any fabrics. [17] X Research source If your bedding is colored, avoid using hydrogen peroxide, as this may discolor them. Make sure the stain is completely gone before putting your bedding in the dryer."

Once the stain is gone, place an absorbent pad over the area to soak up the liquid, then allow the carpet to air dry. [18] X Research source This works for carpets made of synthetic fibers.
