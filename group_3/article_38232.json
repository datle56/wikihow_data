      "title": "Be firm but kind.",
      "content": "Be firm but kind. Respond in a firm tone of voice that makes it clear to your friend that you’ve made up your mind. There’s a fine line between being firm and sounding impolite, though! Phrase your response in a considerate way and try to avoid curt, one-word answers. [1] X Research source For example, if your friend asks you to go to a party or event and you don’t want to, don’t say, “No, I don’t feel like it.” Try something like, “Thanks for inviting me, but that’s not really my scene.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "Respond in a concise way.",
      "content": "Respond in a concise way. While you should avoid being too brisk with your friend, don’t feel like you have to provide some elaborate response. Over-justifying yourself probably won't seem genuine and they may even think you're outright lying to them. Also, if you give too many specific reasons for why you can’t do something, your friend my start offering workarounds when the truth is, you just don’t want to do it. [2] X Research source For example, a good, concise response would be, “I wish I could help, but unfortunately my schedule is already jam-packed.” Try something like, “I’m flattered that you asked me, but I can’t this time.”"

    {
      "title": "Use clear language to avoid any misunderstandings.",
      "content": "Use clear language to avoid any misunderstandings. Avoid responses like “Maybe,” “Let me check my schedule,” and “Give me a call later” if you already know your answer is definitely “no.” Halfhearted answers like these are unclear and easily misinterpreted. Your friend may assume that you’ll move your schedule around to accommodate or that you're considering what they asked of you.

Go to source Go for a clear response like, “Thanks for inviting me, but I have something else to do that day and I can’t get out of it.” Another good option might be, “Thanks for the babysitting offer, but I have a part-time job now and I really don’t have extra time.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "Don’t delay your response.",
      "content": "Don’t delay your response. It may seem easier to put your friend off by saying something like, “I’ll think about it” or “Let me get back to you,” but you’re only delaying the inevitable. Waiting to give an answer may also put your friend in a bind, which could result in some anger later on. [4] X Research source For example, if your friend asks you to help with a project and you say, “Let me get back to you,” you’re wasting their time when they could be looking for someone else to help them instead."

    {
      "title": "Avoid apologizing repeatedly.",
      "content": "Avoid apologizing repeatedly. Something like, “I’m sorry, but I can’t” is totally fine, but elaborate and profuse apologizing is unnecessary and may even make your friend feel like they should be mad at you—you’ve clearly done something that warrants multiple apologies! Stick with one empathetic apology and move on. [5] X Research source For example, you might say, “I’m really sorry, I wish that I could loan you $20, but I just don’t have it right now.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "Don’t be afraid to say “no” twice, if necessary.",
      "content": "Don’t be afraid to say “no” twice, if necessary. You may have a friend who doesn’t respect boundaries or who is very persistent. If you’ve caved and said “yes” to something in the past, especially after initially saying “no,” your friend may think they can get away with this behavior again. If they keep asking you the same question, you may need to be a little blunt to get through to your friend. [6] X Research source For example, you might need to say, “I definitely can’t/don’t want to do that. The answer is ‘no’ and I won’t change my mind on this.”"

      "title": "Change the subject or walk away if your friend is being pushy.",
      "content": "Change the subject or walk away if your friend is being pushy. If you’ve turned your friend down multiple times and they still won’t respect or accept your answer, it’s perfectly fine to just walk away. You declined as politely as you could more than once, very bluntly, and there’s nothing else you can really do. If you hang around, they’ll just keep asking. [7] X Research source If you feel bad about walking off, you can say something like, “I have to get to a meeting/class/work. See you later.” If your friend is really pushing it, walking off without another word may be the best way to get your point across."

      "title": "Offer an alternative or say “yes” to something else.",
      "content": "Offer an alternative or say “yes” to something else. Offering something else while also saying “no” to the original question can definitely help if you’re worried about hurting your friend’s feelings. For example, you could say something like, “I can’t help you write the essay, but I’m heading to the library right now, so I can help you look for some books and resources.” [8] X Trustworthy Source HelpGuide Nonprofit organization dedicated to providing free, evidence-based mental health and wellness resources.

      "title": "Provide an explanation but keep it brief.",
      "content": "Provide an explanation but keep it brief. Saying “no” without giving any explanation at all may come off as callous or rude. If you’re worried about upsetting your friend, offering an explanation can help them understand why you’re declining. The key is to keep your explanation brief and to the point. You don’t need to over-explain yourself, and doing so could make it seem like you’re just making up excuses. [9] X Research source For example, you might say, “I can’t go to that party because I don’t want to see Erik and I know he’s going to be there. We just broke up and I’m just not ready for that.”"

    {
      "title": "Use a sympathetic tone.",
      "content": "Use a sympathetic tone. Turning someone down can easily hurt their feelings, and some subjects are more delicate than others. Empathizing with your friend shows them that you care about their feelings and that your “no” isn’t personal. For example, you might say, “I know how much it means to you, and it really stinks that I can’t be there. I wish I could be.” [10] X Research source You might also try something like, “I wish I could help with that, but I can’t. I dealt with something similar last year, so I definitely understand how rough it can be.”"

      "title": "Thank your friend if you’re turning down an offer or opportunity.",
      "content": "Thank your friend if you’re turning down an offer or opportunity. If a friend offers to help you with something, it’s only polite to say “thank you,” even if it’s something that you definitely don’t want or have no interest in doing. For example, you might say, “Thanks so much for offering to let me borrow your prom dress from last year. You rock that style, but it doesn’t look nearly as good on me.” [11] X Research source Or, you could say, “Thank you for offering to get me an interview at your company! That’s really flattering, but I don’t think my skills will be a good fit.”"

It’s easy to feel bad about saying “no” to a friend, but chances are, you have a really good reason! It’s important to take time to rest if you’re exhausted and overworked. If your friend wants you to do something that makes you uncomfortable, you shouldn’t feel obligated. Sometimes, saying “no” really is the best option for everyone. [13] X Research source In the long run, always saying “yes” to a friend, even when you don’t want to, could make you feel bitter or resentful toward that person, and that’s not good."

[14] X Expert Source Jennifer Butler, MSW Life Coach Expert Interview. 31 July 2020. Maybe saying “yes” will require you to sacrifice time that you desperately need for something else. Perhaps saying “yes” will force you to go against beliefs that are very important to you. There’s a reason you said “no” and keeping it in mind can keep the guilt at bay. [15] X Research source"

      "content": "Keep your friend’s best interests in mind. If your friend is pressuring you to do something harmful or dangerous, like take drugs or cheat on a test, saying “no” might prevent them from going through with something they’ll regret. At the very least, it will probably make them reconsider. As a true friend, it’s your responsibility to keep your friend’s best interests in mind. Saying “no” doesn’t make you a bad friend. For example, if your friend asks you to sneak out to go to a wild party with older kids, don't feel guilty for declining. She may decide to skip the party if she has to go by herself, which means she won’t be offered drugs and alcohol or drive while intoxicated."

      "content": "Don’t dwell on the situation. In most situations, the best thing to do is just say “no” to your friend and move on. Chances are, your answer won’t be keeping your friend up at night, so there’s no reason for you to waste time feeling bad about it. You may feel a twinge of guilt at the time, and that’s normal. Just remind yourself that it’s okay to say \"no\" and let that guilty feeling pass. [16] X Expert Source Jennifer Butler, MSW Life Coach Expert Interview. 31 July 2020."

      "content": "Remember that a real friend should accept your answer. Even if your friend is a little upset with you, holding a grudge against you is unacceptable. No matter what your reasons are for saying “no,” a true friend will respect and accept your decision, even if they don't understand it. If they don’t seem to be getting over it, ask them about their feelings and how you can help smooth things over. [17] X Expert Source Jennifer Butler, MSW Life Coach Expert Interview. 31 July 2020. For example, you might say, “I feel awful that I couldn’t be there for you, but I honestly had no choice. What can I do to make you feel better about this?”"
