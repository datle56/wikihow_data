      "content": "Ask the doctor to fill out and sign a medical excuse note. Do this as soon as possible after the examination, so neither you nor your physician forget about it. In some instances, the doctor may ask you when you would prefer to return to work or school. In that case, choose a date that you believe you will be able to recover sufficiently by to resume your regular duties or attend classes. If your doctor believes you can return to work or school right away, but you disagree, find another doctor and get a second opinion. Otherwise, you’ll have to negotiate absences without the benefit of a medical excuse note."

Forgery is against the law, and medical note forgers who get caught can face up to 1 year in prison, 3 years of probation, and $1000 in penalties – not to mention the loss of their reputation and livelihood.
