      "content": "Defrost the meat completely. The best way to do this is to place frozen meat in a sealed container in your refrigerator overnight.

      "title": "Mix your marinade.",
      "content": "Mix your marinade. Add one part acid, one part oil, one part aromatics and salt and/or sugar to taste. The following are excellent ingredients to use in marinades: The best acids for meat are vinegar, lemon juice lime juice, Worcestershire sauce and soy sauce. If you use soy sauce, don’t add extra salt, since it is a main ingredient in the sauce. The best oils are neutral oils, like canola oil and olive oil. Granulated sugar or honey adds sweetness and also encourages a brown color and caramel taste. Use aromatics like crushed garlic, rosemary, red pepper flakes, ginger, bay leaf or steak seasoning. Paprika, chili pepper and jalapenos or other fresh peppers are perfect for a spicy, smoky flavor."

      "title": "Whisk the marinade together.",
      "content": "Whisk the marinade together. Grab a spoon and taste a small amount. The marinade should taste good before it goes on the beef, since the majority of the marinade will stay in the first few cm of the surface."
