      "content": "The earlier you can establish boundaries, the easier it is. If it's still early in your marriage, congratulations! This is the best time to figure out what your boundaries are. It might not feel easy to take a strong stance with your in-laws early on, especially if all you want is to get along with them. However, putting those boundaries in place now will actually make your relationship stronger in the long run, because it will help prevent friction and resentment from building up. [2] X Research source If you've been married for a while, don't give up hope! Just keep in mind that it may take a little extra patience on your behalf. Your in-laws are already used to doing things a certain way and may be resistant to change. [3] X Research source It's best if you speak up as soon as you notice a potential problem, like the first time your mother-in-law comments on what your child is eating or tries to take over in your kitchen. Pretending it's not a problem will make it harder to address later on."

Say something like, \"Do you have a minute to talk? I feel uncomfortable with the way your mom just drops by any time she wants, and I was hoping we could convince her to at least call first.\" Chances are, this won't be a one-time conversation. You may need to re-address the subject as the situation evolves or your needs change. [6] X Expert Source Lauren Urban, LCSW Licensed Psychotherapist Expert Interview. 3 September 2018."

Talk about what is and isn't working, and focus on solutions that you think would make things easier on you. You might say something like, \"I love the relationship between your mom and our kids, but I do need her to stop making comments about the fact that we're not raising them in her church. They can decide that for themselves when they're older.\" Or, you might say, \"It's really stressful when your parents decide spur-of-the-moment that they're coming to stay at our house for the weekend. They need to start staying in a hotel. If money is an issue, we can pay for their room.\""

To help keep the peace, enlist your partner to talk to their parents about the problem. This will also help present a united front to your in-laws, which can help head off some problems before they start. [8] X Research source Try saying something like, \"I feel embarrassed when your dad says you should have married your ex-boyfriend. I know he just wants the best for you, but I really need you to stand up for me next time that happens.\" [9] X Research source If your spouse isn't willing to intervene with their parents on your behalf, spend some time reflecting on the reason why. Are they typically supportive of you, or is this an ongoing pattern? Could they see your request as unreasonable? Are they reluctant to create friction with their parents? Understanding this will help you know how to proceed."

Either way, it's best if you're both there when it takes place. Your partner could say something like, \"Mom, I love you and we are happy to have you in our lives. If you keep speaking badly about Stacy's mom, though, we're not going to spend as much time around you.\" Or, they might say, \"We love seeing you when you come to town, but we're going to pay for you to stay in a hotel from now on. It's just too crowded and stressful with everyone in our home.\" [12] X Research source If your issue is that your in-laws overstay their welcome, you might say, \"We need to start limiting our visits to a certain time-frame so we can keep any other plans that we may have had.\" [13] X Research source"

As the conversation unfolds, they may be curious about what prompted you and your partner to feel the need to establish these boundaries. However, it can sometimes feel hard to think on your feet when you're in the middle of a tough conversation, so it's best to have a few examples in mind beforehand. [14] X Research source Say something like, \"Last week, Sasha and I had plans after dinner with you, but you stayed until nearly 10:00 and we had to cancel.\" Or you could say, \"The last time you watched the kids, I asked you not to let them watch anything scary, but they told me you showed them Halloween .

To keep the peace, you might designate Christmas Day for your parents and alternate the rest of the holidays."

[17] X Research source Try not to take it personally, even if they're directing rude comments toward you specifically. Chances are, they just pictured a certain life for their child and are resistant to the idea that they are making their own path.

[22] X Research source Ask yourself why they might feel like they need to overstep your boundaries—maybe they're having a hard time letting their baby go, or maybe they feel like you don't respect their parenting choices because yours are so different. Do you have any expectations of your in-laws that may be impacting how you see them? If your mother-in-law isn't especially warm, you might not have the type of bond with her that you imagined. Try to focus on her other good qualities, instead. [23] X Research source Look for what you have in common with your in-laws, rather than how you're different."

But try not to let it all build up on you. Instead, stop and ask yourself, \"Is this really important enough to get upset about?\" [24] X Research source It's best to let it go if the consequences of giving in are minor—like letting your child stay up an extra 30 minutes or agreeing to serve Aunt Martha's pumpkin pie instead of your mom's recipe at Thanksgiving. Try deflecting minor problems by saying something like, \"That's an interesting idea, thank you,\" or \"I'll think about that.\" If the impacts are more far-reaching, like your in-laws show up at your house without being invited or undermine your parenting, that's when it's time to set healthy boundaries.

No matter how carefully you explain your point of view, your father-in-law still might make off-color jokes at the dinner table, or your mother-in-law may still try to take over in the kitchen while you're cooking. It's important to be consistent with your boundaries, though—otherwise, your in-law may think it's okay to let things slide. [26] X Research source Try saying something like, \"Jim, we've talked about those types of comments. They make everyone uncomfortable. If you can't stop, we'll have to ask you to enjoy your meal in another room.\" Or, you might say, \"May, I know you love to cook, but I'm going to take the lead for this meal. If you'd like to help, I'd love it if you could make the salad for us. I'll show you where everything is.\" If one of your in-laws is being really disrespectful toward you, it's okay to say something like, \"I'm trying my best to keep things cordial, but if you continue to talk to me that way, I'm going to ask you to leave.\""
