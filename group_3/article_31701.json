      "title": "Thaw the durian if it has been in the freezer.",
      "content": "Thaw the durian if it has been in the freezer. A frozen durian will be almost impossible to cut open. If your fruit has been in the freezer, you’ll need to place it on a towel resting inside a bowl to absorb moisture. Let the durian sit out for at least 6 hours so that it can soften up and become both tastier and easier to open. [1] X Research source Frozen durian is also considered a delicacy. If you want this ice cream-style version, let it thaw for 3 hours and see if you can cut into it."
    },
    {
      "title": "Shake the fruit to see if you hear anything.",
      "content": "Shake the fruit to see if you hear anything. If you don’t hear any noise, your fruit is most likely over-ripe and no longer good to eat. Too much rattling, however, means that the durian is not quite ready to be eaten.You should hear a slight rumbling or rattling that you have to strain your ear to hear. [2] X Research source You can use a cloth or towel to hold the fruit as you shake it. The noise is caused by the seeds. Unripe durians have large seeds and a small amount of flesh that leads to a noisy rattling, while ripe ones have enough flesh to cushion the seed a little, softening the noise."

    {
      "title": "Check the stem for a light color and moist texture.",
      "content": "Check the stem for a light color and moist texture. Fresh and ripe durians should have light-colored stems that feel a little bit wet to the touch. If the durian has been off the tree for a long time, the stem will darken and dry up. [3] X Research source Frozen durians won’t have moist stems, however. You’ll have to go based on color alone."
    },
    {
      "title": "Smell the durian right at the stem to see if it has a strong aroma.",
      "content": "Smell the durian right at the stem to see if it has a strong aroma. Unripe durians have little-to-no smell, while ripe and over-ripe ones have the signature pungent scent. Without experience, it can be difficult to distinguish a ripe durian from an over-ripe one by smell, as the fruit will smell extremely potent either way. [4] X Research source After you’ve smelled a few ripe and over-ripe durians, the difference will become much clearer. Before you have this experience, the smell test is best for identifying unripe durians, as the lack of smell will give it away."
    },
    {
      "title": "Feel the durian to make sure the skin is hard and tight.",
      "content": "Feel the durian to make sure the skin is hard and tight. An over-ripe durian will have soft and loose skin, and the spines will be easy to move. You should be able to tap on the fruit and feel solid, tough skin that bounces your finger back up. [5] X Research source This is a good last-line-of-defense check to see if your durian is too ripe, rather than just ripe enough."
    },
    {
      "title": "Find the 5-pointed star-shaped lines on the fruit.",
      "content": "Find the 5-pointed star-shaped lines on the fruit. Check the opposite side of the durian from the stem to find the seams or grooves between the spines that all commercially-sold durians have. The lines extend out from a center point that is usually right at the base of the fruit. [6] X Research source There will be five lines coming off the center point, arranged in the shape of a star. The gaps indicate where the different pods of fruit inside are located, so this will also ensure that you don’t accidentally cut into the edible part of the fruit."
    },
    {
      "title": "Hold the durian steady with a towel or cloth.",
      "content": "Hold the durian steady with a towel or cloth. As you begin to cut into the durian, it’s important to protect your hands from harm with a piece of fabric like a cloth, rag, or towel. Make sure whatever you choose to use is clean and thick enough that the spines won’t pierce through it. [7] X Research source You can also use gloves, for extra protection."
    },
    {
      "title": "Use a sharp, sturdy knife to pierce the center of the star.",
      "content": "Use a sharp, sturdy knife to pierce the center of the star. While holding the fruit steady, stab the tip of the knife directly into the base of the durian, right where the gaps meet.. The skin will be tough and difficult to pierce through, but if you are holding on tightly to the durian and the knife you should have success. [8] X Research source Try to press the knife at least 2 inches (5.1 cm) into the durian to get all the way through the skin. If you can’t pierce the skin with a knife, you can use a screwdriver and a hammer by pointing the screwdriver at the center point and using the hammer to pierce the skin."
    },
    {
      "title": "Twist the knife in each direction to dig into the seams.",
      "content": "Twist the knife in each direction to dig into the seams. After the knife or screwdriver has gone down 2 inches (5.1 cm) into the fruit, rock the tool back and forth, as well as left and right. This will allow you to make small cuts into the seams and loosen them up, making them easier to slice and break apart. [9] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Cut along each line with the knife.",
      "content": "Cut along each line with the knife. Once you’ve loosed up the skin, use the knife to cut along the gaps between the spines all the way down the durian, all the way to the stem. You can stop just above the stem, as that tends to be the toughest part of the plant. You’ll have to make 5 different cuts to slice open each seam. [10] X Research source Some people simply pry the durian apart with their hands after piercing it, but this is not the easiest approach."

    {
      "title": "Pull each incision apart with your hands to separate and open the fruit.",
      "content": "Pull each incision apart with your hands to separate and open the fruit. Once you’ve made the 5 cuts, you should be able to open up the durian will very little trouble by pulling down on each of the wedges made with the knife. You may be able to do this without cutting all the way down, but it will be much easier if you do. [11] X Research source Use a cloth or towel to protect your hands. If you are especially concerned for your hands, you can use a clean pair of gardening gloves."
    },
    {
      "title": "Remove the “pods” from the durian.",
      "content": "Remove the “pods” from the durian. After the durian is open, you will notice a number of tan or yellow “pods” inside. These fleshy, pear-shaped parts of the plant are the edible part. They should separate from the rest of the flesh easily with just a little prying, but you can use a knife to cut off any parts that stick together. [12] X Research source The fruit is ready to eat as soon as you open it. Check to make sure the pods don’t have any brown discoloration. If one is slightly discolored, but the rest appear normal, they are still safe to eat."
