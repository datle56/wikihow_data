      "content": "Obtain a list of email addresses. If you're just sending a one-time message to many email addresses, you can just add the addresses to the \"BCC\" field of the message header. This method will work best for smaller lists of fewer than 500 recipients. The email list can be in the form of a spreadsheet , document, or text file. Most email providers limit the number of recipients to whom you can address a message, and many also cap the number of messages you can send in a single day. Gmail, for example, will not allow you to send a message to more than 500 people at once, nor will they allow you to send more than 500 messages per day.
