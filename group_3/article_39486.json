      "content": "Remove your pad, tampon, or cup before you shower. It’s fine to let your vagina bleed in the shower. The blood will run right down the drain. If you wore a pad, the brown or red tinged water that you see going down the drain will likely be old blood that was stuck to your pubic hairs. It’s important to rinse this off. Not cleaning off this old blood will cause an odor and it may also increase your risk of infection. [1] X Research source Don’t worry about the blood staining the shower. It will not make contact with it long enough to do this. Just keep the water running until your shower is over and then check to see if there’s any blood that you need to rinse down the drain. If you’re showering at a gym or in another public place, you may leave a tampon or menstrual cup in during the shower if you prefer."

While standing in the shower, let the water flow down the front of your body and over your vagina. If needed, you can also spread apart the labia to allow the water to flow over the inside of your vaginal lips.
