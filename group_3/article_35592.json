      "content": "Shovel gravel into a wheelbarrow to move it around your yard. Gravel or pebbles can get caught in a lawn mower, so it’s important to be thorough when you remove these. Start by shoveling as much gravel as you can into a wheelbarrow or waste container. Use a rake to gather stones the shovel missed. [1] X Research source If your gravel path or garden has a geotextile cloth underneath, just lift it up after you’ve shoveled away some gravel to cleanly remove any stragglers."

      "content": "Loosen soil and expose larger rocks with a rototiller. First, slowly and carefully push the rototiller to break up the top few inches of soil. As stones turn up, pick them up and place them in a wheelbarrow to keep them out of the way. To dispose of them, wheel them to a dumpster (or put them directly into one). [2] X Research source Rototillers can be bought or rented at most home improvement stores or online."

      "title": "Rake through the loosened soil to gather small rocks you missed.",
      "content": "Rake through the loosened soil to gather small rocks you missed. A sturdy, metal rake works best. Rake the stones into a pile and shovel them into a wheelbarrow, dumpster, or separate pile to use or clean later. [3] X Research source It's tempting to leave rocks in the soil since grass will grow over them, but removing them makes planting a garden easier (and protects your lawn mower and other equipment)."

      "title": "Drive a tractor plow to scoop rocks from a large area of soil with less labor.",
      "content": "Drive a tractor plow to scoop rocks from a large area of soil with less labor. This method can be expensive, but saves a lot of elbow grease. Rent a tractor with a plow attachment. Drive over the area you want to clear, using the plow to collect loose rocks. Sift the dirt away from the rocks and spread it back on the ground. [4] X Research source Go over the ground in sections rather than doing the entire area all at once. This works best for rocks that are bigger than gravel but smaller than boulders. In landscaping, boulders are rocks bigger than 16 inches (41 cm) in diameter."

      "title": "Roll large rocks and boulders out of your yard with a pry bar.",
      "content": "Roll large rocks and boulders out of your yard with a pry bar. Use a flat stone or other hardy object as a fulcrum and place it near the boulder so they’re almost touching. Take a long pry bar and stick the end between the fulcrum and boulder. Push down on the high end of the bar to leverage the boulder forward. [5] X Research source Repeat this motion until you’ve moved the boulder to its final destination. If the boulder is light, place it on a wooden board with parallel metal rods underneath. Roll the board over the rods, moving the rear rod to the front as you go. If the boulder is partially buried, dig around it with a shovel until the entire rock is exposed. Lift it into a wheelbarrow or onto a rolling board. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Dispose of your landscaping rocks with a trailer or junk removal service. The easiest way to get rid of the rocks is to place them in a dumpster and call a junk removal company to take them away. You can also rent a truck and trailer to drive them yourself to a yard waste disposal place that accepts gravel and rock. [7] X Research source Post photos of your rocks online or put a sign in your yard that says “Free!” Anyone interested in using them will be happy to take a few off your hands."

First, shovel the gravel on top of the sifter and move the rocks around with your hands or a garden hoe to shake loose dirt and leaves away. Put the cleaned gravel in a wheelbarrow or separate pile to reinstall later and shovel up the dirt that fell under the sifter. [8] X Research source If you don’t own a sifter, build one by nailing together a wooden frame and laying hardware cloth fencing (with 0.5 inches (1.3 cm) spacing) over it. [9] X Research source"

      "content": "Spray your gravel with water to remove stubborn dirt. Do this while your gravel is still on the sifter to get the maximum clean. Beware that the water will mix with the dirt underneath the sifter and make mud (consider doing this over a tarp for easy cleanup or in a driveway where you can spray the mud away). [10] X Research source ​​ Let the gravel dry completely before reinstalling (dirt will cling to wet rocks). Place landscaping fabric down before reinstalling your gravel. It will block weed growth and help keep dirt from mixing with your gravel again. [11] X Research source"

      "content": "Use a pressure washer to blast stubborn dirt off larger rocks. If you have one available, it saves you the trouble of scrubbing mold or fungus on your rocks by hand. Stand away so the tip of the washer is about 2 feet (0.61 m) away from the rock. Spray at an angle to prevent debris from blowing back at you. [12] X Research source Spray with a sweeping motion, like you’re using a broom. If the dirt isn’t blowing away, try moving closer."

Clean rocks look pleasing on their own, but there are a variety of ways to make them shine and give your rock landscaping a refined look. Make sure your rocks have thoroughly dried before trying some of these methods to customize them: Polish stones with a heavy fabric (like denim) until they start to shine. You can leave them like this or seal them with mineral oil or commercial rock polish. [15] X Research source Use rock stain to change your stones’ colors or try stone enhancers to bring out the rocks’ natural sheen. Spray paint your rocks to be whatever color you like! Wait for the paint to dry completely and then apply a clear sealant all over. [16] X Research source Apply a water seal to make your rocks look shiny, wet, and clean all year long.

Inside the outline, dig up 8 inches (20 cm) of dirt and replace it with sand. Lay a base layer of stones that fit tightly together around the rim of the pit. [18] X Research source Continue building the walls of your pit, filling in any gaps with small stones or mortar. Add a layer of gravel on top of the sand inside the pit.

Dig a trench for the base of your wall (about 1 inch (2.5 cm) deep for every 8 inches (20 cm) of wall height) and fill it with compact, angular rocks. Add a 1 inch (2.5 cm) layer of sand on top and begin laying the rows of your wall, making sure all rocks have their edges touching. [19] X Research source Use a rubber mallet to tap stones into place and use crushed gravel to fill in gaps in your blocks. Take your time as you lay the stones—a stable, sturdy, straight wall is worth the extra time. Sweep the top of each row before adding a new layer to get rid of small particles that can weather your wall."

[20] X Research source Use enough gravel to make a layer about 2 inches (5.1 cm) thick. Use a rake or shovel to distribute the gravel evenly over the fabric. Trim any overhanging landscaping fabric from the edges of your new path. Try adding large, flat flagstone or trowel concrete pavers to your path to use as decorative stepping stones."
