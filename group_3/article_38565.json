The catch is that viewing your listening time is not free—you'll need to pay for Spotistats Plus. Fortunately, you'll only have to pay once—after that, you can view your listening time as often as you'd like. You can get the app by searching for \"Spotistats for Spotify\" in your phone or tablet's app store, or by visiting https://spotistats.app/ and tapping the link for Google Play or App Store . To see your listening time, you'll need to request your listening data from Spotify, which can take up to 30 days (though it's usually quicker than that)."
