      "content": "“Naur” is the word “no” spoken with an Australian accent. It’s the literal spelling of how someone with an Australian accent says the word “no,” poking a bit of fun at the drawn-out and nasally-sounding word. [1] X Research source You’ll likely see “naur” mainly on social media, since the slang word spread like a wildfire over platforms like TikTok and Twitter."

      "title": "“Naur” can literally just mean “no.”",
      "content": "“Naur” can literally just mean “no.” If you go to Australia, chances are you’ll hear “naur” quite often, just like you would hear “no” in the US. There’s nothing special about it here, aside from the fact that it gets an extra syllable compared to when it’s said with an American accent and is spelled a bit differently when typed out. “Naur, I don’t think I’m going to school today.” “Naur, I’d rather not do that.” “Naur way. I don’t believe you.”"

      "title": "“Naur” can be a very strong “no.”",
      "content": "“Naur” can be a very strong “no.” It’s like saying “no” but with about five exclamation points after it. People can use “naur” to express some very strong emotions, usually along the lines of dislike or disapproval. [2] X Research source “Naur, why would you do that?” “Naur!! I’m not doing it!” “Naur you can’t!”"

      "title": "“Naur” can also be used in place of “know.”",
      "content": "“Naur” can also be used in place of “know.” Both “no” and “know” have the same pronunciation, so it makes sense that “naur” can be used to represent both. [3] X Research source “I don’t naur, why don’t you ask him?” “Do you naur the answer?” “Naur, I don’t naur why she did that.”"

      "content": "Use “naur” when you want to be a bit dramatic. Let everyone know just how upset or frustrated you are by using “naur.” Adding a few extra r’s at the end can also help in getting across the message that you’re seriously feeling let down.

      "title": "Be extra whiny towards someone by using “naur.”",
      "content": "Be extra whiny towards someone by using “naur.” Something about the super drawn out sound paired with that sort of nasally tone just makes “naur” perfect to use when you want to whine, either through text or out loud. “Naur I don’t want to!” “Naurrr don’t go!” “Naur mate you just don’t get it.”"
