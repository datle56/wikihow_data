Though asbestos was no longer legal to use after the late 1970s, it was not uncommon for drywall compounds used in textured ceilings to contain asbestos.

      "content": "Prepare the area where the ceiling will be sanded. Make sure all electrical outlets are covered well. Cover the floor in heavy duty plastic and bring it up the wall about 1 foot (0.3 m). Tape it in place. Cover the walls with heavy duty plastic and keep it in place with painter's tape all along the top so no dust can fall through. Make sure the plastic is long enough to reach the floor. Cover the floor with plastic for sanding a stipple ceiling and resin paper for sanding a popcorn ceiling."
