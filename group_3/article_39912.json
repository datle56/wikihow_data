      "content": "“Sliving” means “killing it.” “Sliving” (rhymes with “living”) is a portmanteau of the words “slaying” and “living,” and is used to say that you’re basically killing it—you’re doing what you want on your terms, you’re totally self-empowered, and you’re looking super glamorous while you’re doing it. [1] X Research source Paris Hilton, the term’s originator, defined “sliving” in an E! News interview as: “‘slaying’ mixed with ‘living my best life.’ I am sliving, sliving it, sliving my best life, sliving single.” Example: Hilton herself captioned a November 2019 photo of her with Diplo, “Celebrating with the #BirthdayBoy 💥 Happy Birthday @diplo 🎈🎂🎈#Sliving ⚡️” Example: Instagram user @sophiegreene__ captioned a reel of her meeting Paris Hilton: “#sliving my best life and met an icon @parishilton !! #lovesit”"

      "content": "Paris Hilton created the term at a Halloween party in 2019. As Hilton explains in the third episode of her Netflix cooking show Cooking with Paris , “‘Sliving’ was invented last Halloween when I was at a party, and I was so excited, ‘sliving’ just came out. My friends were like, ‘Sliving?’ and I was like, ‘Oh sh*t.’” [2] X Research source She first aired the word publicly on Instagram in a post dated November 7, 2019, that featured glam and seductive photos of her on the cover of Oyster Magazine captioned, “#Sliving on my new @OysterMag covers 🔥.” The emergence of “sliving” suggests Hilton has moved on from her previous catchphrase, “That’s hot,” which she used a lot on her and Nicole Richie’s hit reality show The Simple Life in the early 2000s."

      "content": "Use “sliving” to describe anything fun, glamorous, or amazing. Next time you do something super impressive or that showcases how your life is truly fantastic, use “sliving” to get the message across. Or next time you’re just feeling absolutely fabulous about yourself (or see somebody else who’s living their best life), how else can you describe it but as “sliving”? The word is usually used as a verb (as in “slaying”), but it can also be used as an adjective or a noun: Verb: “I’m sliving at this new job!” Adjective: “That haircut is totally sliving!” Noun: “You’re an absolute sliver, darling, don’t ever change.”"

      "content": "Paris Hilton and her fans use the term. Hilton uses “sliving” often to describe her amazing lifestyle and many business ventures. She even calls her home “Slivington Manor”! [3] X Research source Hilton has integrated the word “sliving” into her life and lifestyle so thoroughly that she’s actually had it trademarked. [4] X Research source Hilton has also used the term on social media posts about being a new mom, like in a TikTok video she posted of her baby dancing with Hilton saying from behind the camera, \"Sliving!\" and hashtagged \"#SlivingMom.\" Mostly, fans use the term in posts referencing the icon, as in this post by Twitter user @zach_roosa that just says, “I love you @ParisHilton!! #Sliving.” But the word doesn’t have to be used in reference to Paris—it can be used to refer to anything that slays!"
