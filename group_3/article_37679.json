      "content": "Preheat your oven to 450 °F (232 °C). It will take around 15-30 minutes for your oven to reach this temperature depending on how quickly it warms up, so it’s best to turn it on before you begin prepping. This way, you can place them right into the oven after they’re prepped. [1] X Research source If you don’t plan to cook the potatoes right away, hold off on pre-heating the oven."

      "title": "Rinse the baby potatoes under cool water.",
      "content": "Rinse the baby potatoes under cool water. Use a colander to hold the potatoes while you rinse them. This will help the water and dirt drain out while keeping the potatoes in place. If your baby potatoes do not have any visible dirt clumps on them, you won’t need to do anything else to get them clean."

      "content": "Scrub the potatoes with a vegetable brush to remove excess dirt. Some baby potatoes have minimal dirt on them so you might not need to worry about this. However, if there are visible clumps of dirt on the potatoes, use a vegetable brush to scrub them clean while holding the potatoes under running water. If you do not have a vegetable brush, use your hands to rub the dirt off of the potatoes."

      "content": "Cut the potatoes in half to speed up cooking time if desired. Place the potatoes on a cutting board and cut each of them in half with a sharp knife. It’s not necessary to cut the baby potatoes in half, but it will reduce the cooking time, especially if they’re on the large side. If possible, try to select baby potatoes that are all about the same size. This will help to ensure that they cook at the same rate."

      "content": "Place the baby potatoes on a greased baking sheet or jelly roll pan. Spray the baking sheet or pan with non-stick cooking spray or brush vegetable oil onto the surface. If you have a cookie sheet with high edges, this will work as well. [3] X Research source Do not place the potatoes on a baking sheet with no edges as they will likely roll off the edges when you move the pan."

      "content": "Mix the seasoning ingredients together in a small bowl. Combine 1 ⁄ 4 c (59 mL) of extra-virgin olive oil, 2 tablespoons (30g) of fresh, chopped rosemary, 1 minced garlic clove, 1 1/2 teaspoon (7.5g) of salt, and 1/4 teaspoon (1.25g) of black pepper in a small bowl. Then, mix the ingredients together using a whisk or fork. [4] X Research source You can change up the seasoning combination if you'd like to add different flavors to your potatoes. Try adding ½ tsp (2.5 g) of cayenne pepper in place of fresh rosemary for spicy potatoes, or stick with 1 tsp (5 g) each of salt and pepper for a simpler flavor combination. Another type of liquid fat will work in place of olive oil, such as canola, coconut, avocado oil, or even melted butter."

If they are, remove them from the oven while wearing oven mitts and poke a few random potatoes with a fork. They are done if they’re tender when you pierce them with a fork. The potatoes are undercooked if you cannot pierce them easily. [10] X Research source Choose a few of the largest potatoes to check with a fork as these will take longer to cook."
