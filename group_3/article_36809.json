      "content": "Lay the hoodie on a flat work surface with the front facing up. Spread out the hoodie so the hood extends away from the body. You don't want to accidentally cut into the body of the hoodie itself. [1] X Research source Don't work on a rug or carpeted area because you might cut into them as you remove the hood."

      "title": "Cut around the entire hood above the seamline to make a round neckline.",
      "content": "Cut around the entire hood above the seamline to make a round neckline. To easily remove the hood, take a pair of sharp scissors and start cutting along the base of the hood where it meets the hoodie body. It's important to cut right above the seamline so the stitches don't unravel. Keep cutting from the front of the hood all the way around to the opposite side. [2] X Research source Rotary cutters don't work well for this project since you can't see if you're cutting through the bottom seam. You can throw away the hood or use the scrap of fabric for another sewing project."

      "title": "Cut a V-shape on the sweatshirt if you want to change the neckline.",
      "content": "Cut a V-shape on the sweatshirt if you want to change the neckline. If you'd like it to have a V-neck, take your scissors and cut a straight vertical line down the center of the neckline. Cut down as far as you want. Then, cut 2 diagonal lines from the base of the neckline up to the sides of the neck to make a V-shape. [3] X Research source To cut a deep V-neck, make a 5 in (13 cm) vertical line. To create a shallower V-neck, cut the vertical line about 3 inches (7.6 cm) long."

      "title": "Zigzag stitch along the raw edge if you want to prevent it from fraying.",
      "content": "Zigzag stitch along the raw edge if you want to prevent it from fraying. If you want your sweatshirt to have a more finished look, take it over to your sewing machine. Adjust your settings to make a short zigzag stitch and sew directly along the raw edge. Sew around the entire neckline so the fabric doesn't fray. [4] X Research source If you like the casual look, skip this step and leave the raw edge exposed. Keep in mind that the edge will fray as you wash and dry the sweatshirt."

    {
      "title": "Fold the sweater and cut across the neck to make an off-the-shoulder sweater.",
      "content": "Fold the sweater and cut across the neck to make an off-the-shoulder sweater. Once you've cut the hood off, fold the sweater in half vertically and use chalk to mark a diagonal line that's at least 2 inches (5.1 cm) away from the neckline. Cut along this line so you go through the folded sweater and open it to reveal the off-the-shoulder neckline. [5] X Research source Try on the sweatshirt to see if it falls down on your shoulders. If it doesn't, take it off and cut off another 1 inch (2.5 cm) from the neckline."

      "content": "Lay the hoodie flat so the front faces up. Pull the hood out so it extends away from the body. Then, look for the seam where the hood meets the body of the sweater. You'll be using this as a starting point for your measurements."

      "content": "Make 3 or 4 chalk marks that are 3 in (7.6 cm) above the seam of the hood. Place a ruler at the seam and measure 3 inches (7.6 cm) above it. Mark the fabric with chalk and repeat this on the opposite side of the hood. Then, flip over the hoodie so you can make another mark on the back of the hood. If you want a narrow collar, mark at about 2 inches (5.1 cm) instead of at 3 inches (7.6 cm). If you have tailor's chalk, use that instead since it won't smear like standard chalk."

      "title": "Draw a horizontal line to connect the chalk marks.",
      "content": "Draw a horizontal line to connect the chalk marks. Place your ruler horizontally so it passes through a few of the marks you made. Then, draw a horizontal line to connect them. Move your ruler so you can continue making the line around the entire hood. [6] X Research source It's important to make the line even so your collar isn't lopsided."

      "content": "Fold the raw edge of the collar over by a total of 1 inch (2.5 cm). Take the raw edge and fold it over by 1 ⁄ 4 inch (0.64 cm) towards the inside of the hoodie. Fold it over 1 more time by about 3 ⁄ 4 inch (1.9 cm). Then, insert sewing pins horizontally through the folded fabric so the collar stays in place. [8] X Research source Folding the fabric a few times completely hides the raw edge."

      "title": "Straight stitch across the folded edge to secure the collar.",
      "content": "Straight stitch across the folded edge to secure the collar. Start sewing at the front of the hoodie and stitch up to the corner of the collar. Then, straight stitch around the corner to the opposite side of the front and sew down to the seam. This creates a topstitch and finishes the edges of your collar. [9] X Research source Choose a thread color that matches your hoodie if you want it to blend in. If you'd like the topstitch to stand out, pick a thread color that compliments the hoodie. For example, if the sweater is black with a neon green logo, choose a bright green or white thread. If you want the thread to blend in, choose black thread."
