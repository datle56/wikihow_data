      "content": "Prop the ladder against the side of your house under your bedroom window. You should prop the ladder under your window earlier in the day while your family isn't home. If the ladder will be seen by your family, this may not be the best method for you to sneak out of your window. There are a few different types of ladders â€“ extension ladders or tall step ladders are probably best for this type of scenario. Make sure that the ladder is long enough to reach up to your second story window."

      "content": "Get a friend to hold the bottom of the ladder for safety. Having a second person to assist you when climbing a ladder is always a good safety precaution. However, if you don't have anyone to sneak out with you, you can always use a sandbag, or something else heavy, to secure the bottom of the ladder in place. [1] X Research source If you have a friend helping you sneak out, your friend could also bring the ladder to your window. This would eliminate you needing to set up the ladder beforehand."

      "content": "Slowly and quietly climb down the ladder. Open your window and remove the screen. Leave the screen in your bedroom so that you can put it back on when you sneak back in.

Once you feel like you're secure, climb all the way down the ladder. Leave the ladder in place so that you an climb back up it when you return home."

      "content": "Consider buying a ladder if your family does not own one. You can buy a ladder and keep it in the basement or garage, or you can buy a rope ladder to keep in your room. A rope ladder will be more discreet, but is also a bit harder to use. Both types of ladders can usually be purchased at hardware stores."

      "content": "Find a sturdy rope that will hold your weight. Look for a thick rope that will not break when you climb down it. You can test the rope by hanging it to a study object, such as a tree, and swinging on it. Look in your basement or garage to find a rope. If you cannot find a rope in your house, go to a hardware store."

      "content": "Make a rope out of bedsheets. Take a few bedsheets (roughly 3-4) that, tied together, will reach from your bedroom to the ground. Take your bed sheets one at a time, and twist each one tightly, length wise. Then, tie a few knots in each sheet, and tie the sheets together. Double knot each knot tightly so that your sheet rope will not break. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Tie the rope to something heavy enough and sturdy enough to hold your weight. This can be a heavy bed frame, the foot of a sturdy desk or bookcase, etc. Whatever you tie your rope to, make sure it is something that cannot be moved by your weight. Double knot the rope when you tie it to your sturdy piece of furniture. The object you're tying your rope to should weigh substantially more than you in order to hold your weight. To see if an object will hold your weight, try moving it with all of your strength. If you can't get it to budge, it should most likely be able to hold your weight."

Toss the rope out of your window so that it reaches down to the ground. Slowly and carefully climb out of the window, feet first, and begin to climb down the rope. Use the knots that you've tied into your rope to support your hands and feet as you climb down. Leave the rope hanging down so you can climb back up it when you return home."

Simply open your window, and climb onto the nearest tree branch. Then, proceed to climb down your tree. If you plan on sneaking out often, it might be a good idea to add some easily climbable steps to your tree. This can be done by simply nailing pieces of wood onto the trunk of your tree. Use these pieces of wood as steps to climb up and down the trunk of your tree. [3] X Research source"

Plus, if you get caught sneaking back in, you can always say that you came downstairs to get a glass of water from the kitchen or a late night snack. If you have a loud dog, an alarm, creaky stairs, etc., then climb back in your window the same way you climbed out."
