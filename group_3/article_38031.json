There are a number of things you can do to continue to save money once you head to the grocery store. Shop at a reasonably priced store that still has high quality items. Don't go to the fancy grocery store just because it's cheaper. The amount of money you spend on overpriced produce at the gourmet store will add up. Go for the generic brand products. They will taste just as good as the name-brand products and will save you serious cash. Use coupons. Using coupons you find online, in the mail, or from your local store will save you tons of money. Make sure you only use coupons on the items you need. [13] X Research source Save money by preparing food at home yourself instead of buying prepared items at the store. If an item you normally buy is on sale, buy as much of it as you can keep. Buy in bulk. You'll save money if you buy your paper products or other items in bulk, as long as you can store them."

Freeze your bread and toast it when you make a sandwich. This will keep you from having to throw out half a loaf of bread every week. Make sure to cook items that will expire soon, like pasta that's been sitting in your cabinet for a while."

Buy online videos or DVDs that will give you a great workout from the comfort of your own home. Work out at home. You don't need a home gym to do push-ups, sit-ups, and serious abdominal exercises.

You don't have to spend all of your social time at home to save money. There will be times when you do go out to have some fun with friends, and you can still be smart and save money no matter what. If you're going out to eat, eat a little something at home first so you aren't so hungry that you order everything on the menu. If you're eating dinner with a bigger group, see if you can get a separate check. This will be a small pain, but it will save you the hassle of figuring how much you owe to a big group and inevitably overpaying. If you're hitting up the bars with a group of friends and you're not the one driving, have a drink or two at home first so you don't end up spending so much money at the bar. If a friend asks you out for drinks, pick a place with a happy hour so you can save some money."
