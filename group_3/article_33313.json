Every time that you successfully pick up a stick, you may try to pick up another stick. Keep picking up sticks until you move another stick and lose your turn. You can set a limit on the number of sticks that may be picked up per turn. Setting a limit is a good way to make the game last longer and also avoid having someone pick up all of the sticks on their first turn."

The game will either be over when one of the player reaches the goal score or when all of the sticks have been picked up. If you are playing to a certain score, then add up each player’s points occasionally to see how everyone is doing. If you are just playing until all of the sticks have been picked up, then stop the game when there are no more sticks to pick up and have the players count the number of sticks they have picked up. The player with the most sticks wins. To start a new round, gather all of the sticks again and do a new stick drop."
