      "content": "Metallic odors are usually a sign there’s excess iron in your stool. Iron is essential for making hemoglobin—the primary protein in red blood cells. As a result, blood has a metallic odor, which is probably what you’re smelling in your stool. Don’t worry though, this is surprisingly common and probably not serious. Here's what you should look out for and what you should do next: [1] X Trustworthy Source Johns Hopkins Medicine Official resource database of the world-leading Johns Hopkins Hospital Go to source Bright red blood in the water or on the toilet paper: This means you’re bleeding near your rectum . This is usually due to something like a minor cut, anal fissures, or hemorrhoids, which are no big deal. Though, if your stomach hurts or you feel lightheaded, you should see a doctor. Dark red blood or black, tarry material on your stool: This means that you're bleeding further up in your stomach or intestines. Though this is an unlikely case, it could be something more serious, from an ulcer to stomach cancer. You'll want to see a doctor ASAP. No blood in your stool: In this case, the iron smell isn't from blood and is likely just caused by a harmless diet change. We'll walk through the specifics directly below."

      "content": "The smell may be coming from supplements or medication. A lot of antibiotics seem to cause a metal-like odor in your stool. Beyond that, if you’re taking any kind of daily vitamin or supplement that contains iron, that’s probably the source of the odor. [4] X Research source Antibiotics kill bacteria, so your stool often ends up just smelling like iron because everything else has been removed. Any antibiotic can cause this odor, although metronidazole seems to be the most common culprit. Any blood thinner medication can also cause a metallic odor in your stool. You should ask your doctor about the odor, but it’s probably no big deal if it’s a byproduct of a vitamin or medication."
