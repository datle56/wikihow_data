      "content": "Wipe down the area around the tear with diluted vinegar. Mix equal parts white vinegar and warm water in a bowl. Then, dip a rag into the mixture and wipe down the area around the tear. This will get rid of any dust or grime to ensure that your repair job sticks to the surface. Then, dry the couch with a clean cloth. [1] X Research source White vinegar is a mild cleaning solution that’s safe to use on real and faux leather. If you don’t have vinegar, use a leather cleaner or leather couch wipes instead. Care for your leather furniture by wiping it down regularly with a clean, dry cloth."

      "content": "Cut a denim patch slightly larger than the tear. Use a pair of scissors to cut a small denim patch that will fit inside of the tear and act as a new layer of substrate to patch the tear. Make sure the patch is larger than the tear itself so it can act as a new layer beneath the leather. [2] X Research source Or, buy a leather repair kit to purchase all of your tools at once. Leather repair kits typically come with a patch, glue, and toothpicks, as well as leather paint to cover over large patches."

      "content": "Insert the patch into the tear. Open 1 side of the tear in the couch with your fingers and fit the patch inside of it. Slide all of the patch inside and try to flatten it out with your fingers. [3] X Research source If the patch crumples or bunches up, pull it out and try to slide it back in."

      "title": "Use tweezers to smooth and flatten the patch.",
      "content": "Use tweezers to smooth and flatten the patch. Grab the patch with a pair of tweezers and stretch and flatten it out to create a smooth background behind the patch. Feel the leather above the patch for any bumps or ridges so you know that it is smooth. [4] X Research source If you find any bumps or ridges, adjust the patch with the tweezers so it’s flat."

      "content": "Spread the glue on the patch beneath the tear. Lift up 1 side of the tear and insert the toothpick inside. Spread the glue around on the patch beneath the tear so there’s an even layer. [8] X Research source If you’re working on a hole rather than a tear, spread a soft filler into the hole to fill the space. Let the filler sit for about 20 to 40 minutes, then move onto the next step. [9] X Research source"

[10] X Expert Source Mallika Sharma Certified Leather Care Technician Expert Interview. 7 January 2021. Use your fingers to smooth out any bumps or ridges in the tear so it’s consistent. If you don’t line it up properly at first, separate the tear and reconnect the two sides. If the tear is uneven and has ripped edges, carefully piece them back together with your fingers so the edges are connected."

      "content": "Hold a book against the tear for 5 minutes. Once the glue has been applied, it needs to set. Press a board or a book against the tear, maintaining a gentle pressure. After 5 minutes, the glue will have set, but wait a full hour before you sit on the couch again. [11] X Research source If the tear reopens, apply a little more glue to repair it before allowing it to set again."

      "title": "Paint the leather",
      "content": "Paint the leather if you can see the patch. For large patches and repairs, the patch beneath the leather might be visible. If that’s the case, grab some leather paint and make sure it matches the color of your couch. Then, use a paint brush or a sponge to dab it onto the dried glue. Wait about 1 hour before sitting on the couch again. [12] X Research source If you purchase a leather repair kit, choose the kit based on the color of paint that you want."
