When you’re alone, turn off the lights in the room and hide in a closet, under a desk, or behind a piece of furniture. Then, when your target enters the room and turns on the lights, jump out from where you are and make a loud noise to scare them. [1] X Research source For an even better scare, put on a mask or a creepy costume so they don’t know who’s scaring them when you jump out. If you want to really scare someone, you can quietly move out of your hiding place when they’re turned with their back facing you. Then, sneak up to them and tap them on the shoulder to scare them!"
