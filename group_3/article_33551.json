In 4/4 time, this is the eighth note. It should come exactly halfway between each number. It helps in the beginning to strum your guitar every time you say a beat and an off-beat, which is when you are saying \"and\"."

Try and play the chord progression while focusing on something else, to build the muscle memory in your mind. Now sing the song and let the playing fall to the background. Your conscious will be concentrating on the singing, but your subconscious will be playing the song. Finally, you will be able, with practice, to change roles back and forth. You will be able to seamlessly switch between focusing on what you are playing and what you are singing. It is quite rare for guitar solos and singing parts to occur at the same time. That is by design, so don't try to change that when you go to write a song."
