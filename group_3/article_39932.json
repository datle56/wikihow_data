      "content": "Practice smiling in front of a mirror. If you want to be really good at something you need to practice, right? Well, smiling is no different. If you're not a person who smiles a lot naturally, you will need to get used to what smiling feels like and learn how to replicate that feeling more naturally. Practice by smiling when no one else is around, in the bathroom, in bed, in your car. That way, you will feel less self-conscious. [1] X Research source Every morning, try to look in the mirror and smile at yourself. Concentrate on making the smile look natural, by extending it to your eyes. A slight upturn of the mouth isn't going to convince anybody. Find a smile that you like the look of and try to memorize how your face feels when you make it. That way, you will be able to replicate that exact smile in everyday situations."

      "content": "Think of a happy event or someone you love. It's no secret that being happy makes you smile, so why not take advantage of that fact? If you find yourself in a situation where you know you'll have to smile and you want it to look natural, take a moment to conjure a happy memory or the face of a person you love. [2] X Research source These positive mental images will automatically boost your mood and help you to smile more naturally. Bottom line: think happy thoughts!"

      "title": "Observe smiley people.",
      "content": "Observe smiley people. Everybody knows at least one person to whom smiling it the easiest, most natural thing in the world. Someone who'll smile at the drop of a hat, at everyone and everything. Chances are this person is well-liked, and is known for being approachable and trustworthy. Such are the powers of a great smile. [3] X Research source Take some time to interact with this person, one-on-one, in a sociable setting and observe how and when they smile. Make a mental note of how often they smile, along with the things they smile in response to. Do they smile when you say something funny? Or even when you don't? Are they smiling to be polite, or just because they seem genuinely happy? Now you've seen how a natural smiler navigates normal conversations, you will feel more confident about adopting similar behaviors and incorporating more smiles into your daily interactions.."

      "title": "Rope in a partner.",
      "content": "Rope in a partner. In situations like this, it can be helpful to have a partner who's willing to help you achieve your goal of smiling more often. It could be a romantic partner, your best friend or a work buddy - it doesn't matter as long as it's someone you can rely on, who has a good sense of humor. All they need to do is give you a little nudge in situations where you forget to smile. That nudge is your queue to break into a luminous grin. You could even come up with a little signal, like a wink or subtle hand gesture, so you can still communicate on opposite sides of a crowded room. A lot of non-smilers get irritated when somebody tells them to \"smile!\" or \"cheer up\". However, if you ask a friend to help you out with smile reminders, it's important that you don't get angry with them when they do their job. Remember -- you asked for it!"

      "title": "Choose a smile trigger.",
      "content": "Choose a smile trigger. Kind of like the \"smile buddy\" from the previous step, a smile trigger is something that will remind you to smile whenever you see or hear it. It could be a certain common word or phrase, like \"please\" or \"thank you\", it could be a little sticky note on the screen of your computer, or it could be the sound of a phone ringing or someone laughing. Once you have chosen your trigger, you must make a conscious effort to smile every time you encounter it. It may feel silly, but it will help you to get in the habit of smiling on command, which helps when it comes to social and business situations. Another cute idea is to draw a little smiley face somewhere you'll often catch sight of it, like on the back of your hand. Do this everyday and remember to smile whenever you look at it, no matter where you are or who you're with."

      "content": "Smile at a stranger. You've probably heard it said that smiling is contagious. That when you smile at a person, they can't help but smile back. Put that theory to the test and make the effort to smile at a complete stranger at least once a day -- whether it's someone on the street, someone at work or school or someone sitting beside you in traffic. Imagine that one friendly gesture setting off a chain reaction that causes your smile to go viral. Pretty good feeling, huh? [4] X Research source In reality, some people will think you're weird and some won't smile back, but don't let that stop you! Think of your smile as a good deed or an act of kindness that could make someone's day just a little bit brighter. But if the other people does smile back (and most will) you'll have shared a special moment with that person, a fleeting connection with another human being that'll leave you with a pep in your step."

      "content": "Keep a smile journal. Over the course of two or three weeks, take a couple of minutes at the end of each day to write down a brief description of every time you smiled and why. Over time, you may notice a pattern and begin to recognize the interactions and occurrences that bring a truly genuine smile to your face. Maybe you saw a cute squirrel hopping along the branch of a tree. Or you took the time to call an old friend. Once you recognize the things that make you smile, you can make a conscious effort to seek those things out in daily life. Another great reason to keep a smile journal is so you can look back through it when you're feeling low and remind yourself of individual instances when you felt genuinely happy. These should perk you up and help you to keep smiling!"

      "content": "Work your facial muscles. Loosening up your facial muscles by doing exercises involving flexing and relaxing may help your face to fall more naturally into a smile, making it feel less odd. One exercise which works the same muscles involved in smiling is as follows: [5] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Take a pencil and place it between your lips. Open your mouth and let the pencil roll back between your teeth, as far as it will go. Bite down on the pencil to hold it in place and hold this position for thirty seconds. Repeat once a day."

      "title": "Fake it until it becomes real.",
      "content": "Fake it until it becomes real. Smiling more often will no doubt feel strange at first -- it will probably feel unnatural and fake. But don't give up. Other people won't even notice the difference and the more often you do it, the more natural it will feel and look. Smiling is a habit, so if you repeat it often enough, you'll smile without even thinking -- which is ultimately what you want to achieve. Make smiles look less fake by smiling with your eyes as well as your mouth. Genuine smiles are marked by a crinkling of the muscles around the eyes, so this is what you should be going for."

This is why you should make an effort to avoid people who gossip, cause problems for others, or constantly walk around with a scowl on their face and a cloud over their head.
