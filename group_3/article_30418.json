[4] X Expert Source Jennifer McVey, Cht Spiritual Director Expert Interview. 21 December 2021. “I want to be rich” is pretty vague (“rich” means different things to different people). Ask yourself a few questions to help you set specific intentions Why do you want more money? Exactly how much money do you need? Do you need one lump sum or more money each month? How much time are you willing to put in? When do you want the money? Clarify these specifics. [5] X Research source For example: “I need a $10,000 raise so I can save up to buy my first home next year.” “I need $2,000 by April 30th to go on vacation to Hawaii this year.” “I want to make $200 more per month while working 40 hours a week so I can explore more nightlife in my city.”"

      "content": "Set goals to improve your finances and break them into smaller steps. Take a hard look at your relationship with money so you can start setting realistic goals . Look at areas where you can improve. Consider what you need to do to reach your end goal. Map out how to get there with smaller, attainable subgoals like saving $100 per month or only paying for takeout once a week. When you see the positive impact of these smaller choices, your end goal won’t seem so far-fetched. [6] X Research source You can’t predict exactly when your money will manifest, but including a timeline in the planning stage gives you a general idea of what to expect as you work toward your goal."

Focus on breaking old spending or saving habits that hold you back and exploring new ways to manage your money. Once you’ve got a plan, it’s time to get to work!

[9] X Research source Leave your comfort zone and old repetitive habits to open yourself up to trying new things. If you need a new result, you have to try new tactics!

What do they consider a worthwhile purchase? Picture yourself in their shoes and then start acting like that version of yourself. Do everything you can to embody that feeling of success. [11] X Research source This practice helps change your mindset about money from one of want and need to one of abundance and opportunity. It also helps you gain clarity on what you really want when you imagine what it’s like to get rid of the financial barrier. Only spend what you can while you embody this successful “future you.” Focus on thoughts, feelings, and priorities rather than actual dollar amounts. Treat everything you buy like a luxury item that makes your life better. Above all, make an effort to leave any financial missteps you’ve made in the past. Keep your focus on the future!"

Be detailed and bold when you paint yourself a mental picture of your future. [12] X Research source Meditating on images of your future is a great way to align your vision with your inner emotions. Try creating a vision board with images and quotes to help you picture your financial future. Place it somewhere you’ll see it often, like near your desk or computer. Try script manifesting if you have trouble picturing things in your mind’s eye. Write in your manifestation journal before bedtime to plant the seed for dreams of your future. Use the 369 method as a form of script manifesting. Just write your desire 3 times in the morning, 6 times in the afternoon, and 9 times at night. Don’t forget to add 888, the angel number associated with financial success, to your vision board or journal. Other angel numbers that may help you visualize abundance are 000 (opportunities are coming), 111 (new beginnings), and 777 (shows you’re on the right path)."

Charge your crystals in moonlight to give them more power. Then, write an affirmation on a slip of paper and put it under your favorite money crystal.

There are even reports that spending money on others can make you feel better than spending it on yourself. [16] X Research source Giving produces a feeling of abundance that will come back to you. You come out on top whether you win the lottery or just have better self-esteem. [17] X Research source You don’t have to give a lot. Buying the guy in line behind you a cup of coffee or dropping an extra dollar in the tip jar sends good vibrations into the universe. Don’t give to others with the goal of getting something back. This sends out the message that you don’t have what you need, which is a negative vibration."

Part of that is having faith that the universe will work for you as long as you believe in yourself and take steps to achieve your goals. Stay positive, even if things are tough or happening very slowly. It’s easy to lose faith and spiral into a negative vibration, but that only pushes your success farther away. Stay grateful, keep your goals clear, and keep up the good work! [18] X Research source Focus on learning, growing, and improving rather than fixating on the end result.

[23] X Research source If you feel you’re not making progress, reevaluate your goals, action plan, or list of desires. Ask yourself questions like, “Was there something I missed?”, “Have my needs changed?”, and “Was my original goal attainable?” Adjust your main goals or mini goals to better fit your financial needs or handle large, unexpected expenses that come up. Aim to hold yourself to your original goals if possible, but don’t beat yourself up if you have to make a few changes. Remember, goals should be flexible, not set in stone."
