      "content": "Locate the 3-7 digit number stamped on your food. Packaged food items sometimes have “Julian Dates” stamped on them that represent the packing date. These dates are 3-7 digits long, and are calculated differently from JD used in astronomy. [2] X Research source Common locations for these numbers include the sides of cartons or the bottom of cans. If your packaged food has a \"best-by\" date, it should be displayed in a normal calendar format, rather than a Julian date, so you don't need to bother converting anything.

You can convert to Gregorian calendar using this chart, but make sure to take into account whether or not you are in a leap year: https://www.scp.byu.edu/docs/doychart.html . [7] X Research source For example, if the JD was 17234, then the year would be 2017, which is not a leap year, so 234 corresponds to the day August 22, 2017. If the JD was 2000107, then the year is 2000, which is a leap year, so the date would be April 16, 2000."

When an astronomer reports a sighting, they often report this information in a Julian Date, rather than using a Gregorian calendar date and the time of day. If you’re trying to read a weird-looking date from the back of a can, check out the first method instead. The current Julian date in is about 2500000, so if it’s close to that, that’s a good tip off, too. [8] X Research source If it says MJD next to the number, it’s a modified Julian date, which is related by the formula MJD = JD - 2400000.5"

If you did it by hand, you would have to take into account leap years , conversions between different calendars, and time zones, so it is best to use a program that already takes into account these factors to avoid mistakes.
