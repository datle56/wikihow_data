      "content": "Determine if you need to go to a doctor. Splinters that are deep under your nail, or have already become infected, may need to be removed by a doctor. You can tell a splinter is infected if it continues to be painful after a few days and the area around the splinter is swollen or red in color. [2] X Trustworthy Source Seattle Children's Hospital Health information provided by Seattle Children's hospital. Go to source If the splinter is causing serious and excessive bleeding , go to your local emergency room to have it removed. If the splinter is embedded under your nail such that you are unable to reach it on your own, or if the skin around the splinter is infected, make an appointment to see your family doctor. The doctor can remove the splinter and give you antibiotics. In most cases, the doctor removing your splinter should be able to give you a local anaesthetic to numb the area and reduce the pain of removal. Be aware that a doctor may have to remove some or all of your nail in order to remove the splinter completely."

If you are going to remove the splinter on your own at home, you will most likely need a set of tweezers (as the splinter will probably be too small to grip with your fingers). If the splinter is embedded so far under your nail that no part of the splinter is above your skin, you may also need to use a needle to remove the splinter. [3] X Research source Sterilize any equipment you are planning to use to remove the splinter. You can sterilize tweezers and needles using rubbing alcohol or boiling water. Wash your hands before touching any sterilized equipment. Wash the area and nail where the splinter is located before attempting to remove it in order to help prevent infection. If it is difficult to wash with soap and water, you can also use rubbing alcohol. If you have long nails, you may wish to cut back the nail under which the splinter is embedded before attempting to remove it. This should allow you to see the area better."

These types of splinters can be quite difficult to remove on your own, but you can try using a needle to expose a portion of the splinter in order to grip it with tweezers. [5] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Dermatology Professional organization made of over 20,000 certified dermatologists Go to source Any type of small sewing needle can be used in this procedure. Make sure it has been sterilized before use. Push the needle under the nail, towards the end of the splinter, and use it to pry out the end of the splinter. If you are able to pry enough of the splinter out, grip it with the tweezers and pull it out in the same direction it went in."

[7] X Research source Soak your finger in warm water mixed with one tablespoon of baking soda. You may need to do this up to twice a day for it to be effective. It may take several days of this treatment before the splinter is close enough to the skin to be removed with tweezers, or for it to fall out on its own."

      "content": "Employ hair removal wax . Very fine splinters may be difficult to grip with tweezers. Another option to remove these types of splinters under a nail is to use hair removal wax.

[9] X Trustworthy Source HealthyChildren.org Health information from the American Academy of Pediatrics. Go to source You may need to cut back some of the nail involved in order to obtain better access to the splinter. Apply the heated wax to the area around the splinter.

      "title": "Try ichthammol ointment to remove the splinter.",
      "content": "Try ichthammol ointment to remove the splinter. You should be able to purchase the ointment at a drug store (or online). The ointment works to soften the skin around the splinter, which then helps to expel the splinter naturally. You may need to cut back some or all of the affected nail in order to gain better access to the splinter. This method is also good to use on children, as it usually causes less pain and discomfort. Apply a small amount of the ointment to the area where the splinter is located. Cover or wrap the area with a bandage and leave on for 24 hours. Remove the bandage after 24 hours and inspect the splinter. The purpose of the ointment is to expel the splinter naturally. If the splinter still has not been expelled after 24 hours, but is more accessible, you can use tweezers to remove the splinter."

      "title": "Create a baking soda paste.",
      "content": "Create a baking soda paste. Making your own baking soda paste is an alternative option to using ichthammol ointment. It is best to use this option only if all other options haven’t worked, as the paste may also cause swelling which will make the splinter harder to remove. You may need to cut back some or all of the affected nail in order to obtain better access to the area with the splinter. Combine ¼ teaspoon of baking soda with water until it forms a thick paste. Apply the paste to the area with the splinter, then apply or wrap a bandage around the area. After 24 hours, remove the bandage and check the splinter. The paste may be sufficient enough to allow the splinter to be expelled naturally. If 24 hours wasn’t enough time, you can apply another dab of paste for an additional 24 hours. If the splinter is exposed sufficiently, you can use tweezers at this point to remove it."
