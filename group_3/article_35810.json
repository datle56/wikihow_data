      "content": "Let the burger rest at room temperature for 10 minutes. Place the entire cheeseburger onto a counter or table and let it adjust to room temperature. This makes it easier for the burger to remain an even and consistent temperature during the reheating process. [1] X Research source Make sure that you don’t leave the meat out for more than 2 hours, or else it might go bad."

      "content": "Separate the burger contents onto a flat surface. Lay down on a cutting board or paper towel and take the cheeseburger apart on top of it. Sort the burger’s contents into different piles: the buns, burger patty, toppings, and condiments. When you go to eat the burger, you don’t want to be biting into any warm vegetables.

      "content": "Scrape the cheese and condiments off the patty and buns with a dinner knife. A little can remain, but most of it should be removed. The burger will taste much more fresh and delicious if you add new condiments, anyway. Keeping the cheese on the burger patty won’t change how the patty reheats, but it could melt off during the warming process. [3] X Research source Consider having some slices of American cheese on hand."

      "title": "Examine the vegetables and other toppings for freshness.",
      "content": "Examine the vegetables and other toppings for freshness. Lettuce and tomatoes have a tendency to get soggy during storage, so you may need to toss them. Pickles, onions, bacon, and other toppings with a lower water content tend to be okay and can be saved. [4] X Research source If you want your burger to taste as fresh as possible, consider adding new slices of tomato, lettuce, and onions."

      "content": "Place the patty on a microwave-safe plate. Use a microwave-safe plate or paper towel sheet to reheat your burger patty. Make sure to center the patty in the middle of plate so the burger can be warm throughout. [5] X Research source Look on the bottom of the plate or dish to locate a microwave-safe label."

      "title": "Microwave the patty for 1-2 minutes using a lower power setting.",
      "content": "Microwave the patty for 1-2 minutes using a lower power setting. Set the patty into the microwave and close the door before starting to reheat the meat. Since the meat is cooked already, make sure to use the reheat or set the microwave to a low power (i.e, 30%) so you don’t cook the cheeseburger all over again. If your patty is especially thick, try pausing the microwave cycle and flipping over the burger. [6] X Research source The exact amount of time can vary depending on the thickness of the burger patty and the wattage of your microwave. Check your microwave’s user manual to see if it includes any recommended reheat times."

      "content": "Touch the patty to see if it’s warm. Touch the meat with a single finger to see how warm the meat is. If the burger is warm to the touch, then you can remove it from the microwave. If the meat is cold or just lukewarm, consider heating it for a little longer."

If the burger is especially cold, try reheating it for another half minute. If you’ve reached the 1 minute mark but your patty is still cool to the touch, continue reheating in 10 second intervals. [7] X Research source If you want to add a fresh piece of cheese, place it on top of the patty and microwave the two together for another 10 seconds."

If you’re reusing any old toppings like tomato and onion slices, put them in now—if not, grab some fresh slices from the refrigerator and place them on your burger. Add more condiments if you’d prefer to do so (i.e, ketchup, mayonnaise, mustard, etc.)."

Slide this metal rack onto a wide cooking pan or baking sheet, so no leftover grease from the patty falls onto the oven floor. Once you’ve assembled the rack and pan, go ahead and set them into the oven. [10] X Research source If you’re using a baking pan, consider lining it with a sheet of aluminum foil for extra protection. Be sure to close the oven door after putting in the patty."

Add 0.5 cups (120 mL) of water, or enough to create a thin layer on the bottom of the pan. [12] X Research source Make sure that you have a lid that fits this pan, as the lid will be essential to the reheating process. Alternatively, you can add some chicken stock or white wine instead of water to give the patty an extra dimension of flavor. Since you’re unable to reheat the buns in the sauté pan, consider using the microwave or oven to warm them."

Secure the lid on top of the pan before letting the patty sit for 5 to 7 minutes. [13] X Research source By covering the pan, you allow steam to build up inside. This steam is the primary heat source responsible for reheating the patty. If you want to add a fresh slice of cheese, remove the lid and place the cheese on top for 30 to 60 seconds. Keep the lid off while the cheese melts."
