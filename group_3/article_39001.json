      "title": "Add bait to your trap.",
      "content": "Add bait to your trap. Place the bait on the pedal in the middle of the trap. Bait your Victor trap based on your rat species' diets. The most common rats are black and brown rats. Black rats are herbivores and like fruit or peanut butter. Brown rats, however, are omnivores—they are more likely to be tempted by bacon, dry meats, or strong-smelling cheese. [2] X Research source Chocolate or raisins can also be used. Rats are wary of new objects, so it would be a good idea to use as a bait whatever they are eating for at least a week. Use a toothpick to keep your scent from touching the bait and scaring away rats. For most Victor rat traps, the pedal will be bright yellow. If your rat trap will not set, you may have added too much bait. Return to this step if you cannot set your rat trap and remove some of the bait. [3] X Research source"

Take the armbar and lift it over the kill bar, latching it under the bait pedal. [5] X Research source If you have an easy set rat trap, set the kill bar as far back as possible to trigger the sensitive setting. Keep your finger and thumbs away from the inside area of the kill bar to avoid triggering the strike zone. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Place the trap somewhere with plenty of rodent activity.",
      "content": "Place the trap somewhere with plenty of rodent activity. Because rodents primarily travel near the wall, the baited petal should face that area. If you don't catch any rats after several days to a week, try moving your rat trap elsewhere. Secluded areas behind furniture or underneath outdoor debris are most likely to attract rats. Rodents rarely run in the middle of rooms. Keeping your traps in corners or by walls is your best bet for catching rats."

      "content": "Locate rat paths in your home and place traps alongside these paths. Inspect your home's walls and corners, as well as any dark or covered areas of the floor. Look for rat droppings or brown grease paths that look trampled down. These are areas with heavy rat activity, where you'll want to set your traps. [7] X Research source Rat paths are commonly found near walls, underneath furniture, inside closets, or within cabinets."

Leave your traps out for a few days with bait without setting them the rats grow comfortable around them. When you've noticed that the bait is gone, set the trap so that you catch the next rat that comes along."

Add a few drops of vegetable oil or bacon grease to the spring. Inspect your trap again after several weeks—if it still isn't catching rats, try placing it in another location or throw it away. Machine oil repels rats. Do not use it while oiling your traps. If your rat trap is dirty, use water—with no soap—to clean it off. [8] X Research source"

A wounded rat can drag itself away with the trap still attached before eventually dying, leaving you unable to locate the rotting rat body. To avoid this, tie or tape your rat traps securely to the floor."

Always wear gloves when touching and disposing of rats. [9] X Research source If you notice rat droppings near the trap, handle them while wearing gloves and a breathing mask. Rats and rat droppings can carry deadly diseases like the hantavirus."

Rats that have eaten the poisonous bait, however, can drag it across the floor and spread its chemicals around. They are also more likely to die in an unknown location of the house, and you may not be able to locate its rotting corpse. For safety's sake, use an edible bait.
