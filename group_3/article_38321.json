      "content": "Pick a calendar or planner to use that meets your daily needs. There are plenty of calendars or planners on the market for you to choose from! Opt for one with a daily to-do spread if you want to focus more on daily tasks, or pick one with monthly and weekly spreads to help you plan ahead. Ultimately, choose whatever best suits your needs and lifestyle. [1] X Expert Source Ronitte Libedinsky, MS Academic Tutor Expert Interview. 26 May 2020. If physical planners and calendars aren’t your thing, there are a ton of scheduling apps you can use on your phone. Stick with your phone’s calendar or notes app, or try one like TimeTree or Any.do . Consider using a bullet journal to create your own calendar and to-do list spread to perfectly match your needs. Reader Poll: We asked 168 wikiHow readers if they use a calendar to keep track of their schedule, and 54% said yes . [Take Poll] Keeping a calendar is a great way to remember important events and complete major tasks."

      "content": "Color-code your tasks so your schedule is easier to read at a glance. Look at your list of things you need to do. Then, categorize each type of task to a color. For instance, daily chores may be green, exercise yellow, and homework or work assignments orange. This way, you can easily look at your daily (or evenly weekly) schedule and see what’s on the agenda. Use a colored pen, marker, or highlighter to help organize your tasks in a physical calendar or planner. Type in different text colors on a digital calendar or create each task with a different colored label."

      "content": "Prioritize each task on a number scale to determine what’s important. It’s more effective if you know what needs to be done first when making a daily schedule. So, number your tasks from what needs to be done first to what doesn’t have to get done today. This way, you can easily look at your schedule and know what you must do. [3] X Expert Source Alexander Ruiz, M.Ed. Educational Consultant Expert Interview. 18 June 2020. Try asking yourself these questions to determine what task(s) are of the highest priority: Which task is due first or has a deadline? Which task takes the longest time to complete? Is one task more important than the others? Which task will be the most challenging?"

      "content": "Schedule a time for each task based on importance and relevance. Now it’s time to transfer your notes into your calendar or planner. Make a timetable of your day, and give each time slot a task. Fill in tasks or events with time constraints first, then squeeze in the most important remaining ones. Write how long you expect to spend on each task, too. [5] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Business Review Online and print journal covering topics related to business management practices Go to source For example, you may schedule time to study (2 hours), work out (1 hour), write emails (30 minutes), and walk the dog (30 minutes). Remember to incorporate travel time into your scheduling. For example, do you need to drive to the gym from the library where you're studying? If so, it may take an hour and a half of your time rather than just an hour. Always overestimate how long something will take by a few minutes. Add 25% to the time you allot for tasks in your schedule (for instance, schedule something that takes an hour for an hour and 15 minutes0. This extra time add up and provides a cushion to help you avoid being late or falling behind. There may be some overlap with tasks of high importance and time restraints, and that’s okay! More often than not, the tasks that need to get done have a designated time they must be completed by."

[9] X Research source If you’re using a digital planner or calendar, use a text strikethrough or italic formatting option to show you’ve completed a task. If you don’t complete a task on time, don’t sweat it! If it’s low priority, you can always schedule it for tomorrow. If it’s high priority, try to squeeze it in somewhere else on your schedule."
