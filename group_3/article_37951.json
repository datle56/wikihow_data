Because of this, Sagittarius is more than meets the eye: not just a charming, fun personality, but a student of the world, and an investigator of life’s greatest mysteries."

So, it’s unsurprising that they have no taste for lies or dishonesty. Trust that Sagittarius will almost always tell you the brutal truth—even if you would rather they don't. It’s their blessing and burden: Sagittarius’ friends can trust their words completely, but Sagittarius can’t be trusted to pull any punches. Whether it be your new shirt or old boyfriend, Sagittarius, in their own way, will tell you what they think."

      "content": "Bold. Sagittarius is a fire sign, which means that action and bravery are in their nature. They believe that the world is meant to be experienced. If they have to face fear and judgment in order to take a bite out of their own life, then so be it. Much of the time, Sagittarius acts first and reflects second. This can get them into trouble, sure, but it also promises a life of excitement, wonder, and adventure fit for print."

      "content": "Nomadic. Sagittarius is pulled to the horizon by an otherworldly force. From fascination to new fascination, from place to place—from person to person. Some might call Sag flighty or noncommittal. But to Sagittarius, it’s more about never denying themselves of life’s joys and curiosities. Old flames will never die out in Sagittarius’ heart, but an explorer must explore! Sag is likely to crave new connections constantly, which can strain older relationships."

      "content": "Signs a Sag Likes You Sagittarius is a natural flirt, but how can you tell if you’re special to them? It’s easier than you’d think! Sunny Sag might be all smiles with everyone, but if they like you, they’ll probably leave a few unmissable clues: They introduce you to their friends. If Sag thinks their inner circle will like you, that’s a good sign that they think you’re amazing. They laugh at all of your jokes. Pay close attention to this one. Sag will smile at everyone’s jokes, but when it’s their crush, they’ll always laugh. They call you “smart” or “fun.” These are the highest compliments in a Sagittarius’ book. If they say this about you, they’re definitely falling. They leave a gathering to hang out 1:1 with you. Sag loves big parties, so if they choose just you over a big crowd, that’s huge."

      "title": "Sagittarius & Sagittarius.",
      "content": "Sagittarius & Sagittarius. Are they best friends? Lovers? Both? No one will know for sure—and that’s what makes this couple so special. A Sag-Sag connection will be the most fun, fresh, and lively pairing the zodiac has to offer. Think dance marathons, side-splitting laughter, and adventure on the regular. No one will get Sagittarius quite like a fellow Sag, and for these two, it’s likely to be a no-strings, all-smiles love affair for the ages. That is, if they can both stomach the “What are we?” conversation. Commitment isn’t Sagittarius’ strong suit, but if they both can manage to make it happen, they’ll thrive together."

      "title": "Gemini & Sagittarius.",
      "content": "Gemini & Sagittarius. These two are a match made in heaven—externally, they appear to be ultra-social, the life of every party. But dig a little deeper, and you’ll find that Sag and Gemini are also deeply curious, thoughtful, and intelligent. They’ll enjoy killing it on the dancefloor as much as they’ll thrive in heated intellectual debates. In short, these two could be genuine soulmates. Of course, they both have to stay put long enough to earn the title of soulmates. Gemini might be even flightier than Sagittarius, so again, commitment could be a struggle. But as long as these two promise to buy in, sparks will fly."

      "content": "Aries & Sagittarius. A Sagittarius-Aries pair will be full of fire, fun, and passion. The collective energy here is unbelievable—Sagittarius will be thrilled to find a partner (finally) who can keep up with them. Weekend getaways and wild antics will be on the docket, and between the sheets, these two are likely to connect in a big way. Sagittarius and Aries will be obsessed with each other, and they’ll enjoy a life-changing love affair. But where there are sparks, there could be fire. Sagittarius’ honesty might not mix well with Aries’ short fuse, so for this couple to survive, compromise and communication will be a must."

      "content": "Aquarius & Sagittarius. Sag and Aquarius will cuddle up at night, talking about life’s biggest questions. Between these two, there’ll never be enough to say. Every day brings new fascinating topics, enticing mysteries, and intellectual debates. Sag and Aquarius are both sharp, honest signs, and with each other, they’ll experience the most exciting conversations of their lifetime. Connection and true love are sure to follow. These two are the most independent signs in the zodiac, which generally will work in their favor. Still, relationships are about togetherness, so they’ll have to be mindful to carve out time for their partner—otherwise, the romance could fizzle."

      "title": "Libra & Sagittarius.",
      "content": "Libra & Sagittarius. Sag and Libra are deeply flirtatious people, always surrounded by a cast of hopeful suitors. So when these two choose each other from the crowd, it’ll be a sweet victory. Libra shares Sag’s passion for rigorous discussion, and they both keep a full social calendar, too.This romance will be full of fun, and compatibility is high (and not to mention, these two famously beautiful signs will make a pretty picture!). If Libra falls for Sagittarius though, Sag might start to feel pressured. Libra is a casual dater at the start, but they expect grand romance down the line—which Sagittarius might not be excited to provide. Compromise will be crucial!"

      "title": "Leo & Sagittarius.",
      "content": "Leo & Sagittarius. These two are royalty, simple as that. Leo and Sagittarius will be the “It” couple of everyone’s friend group, like a spotlight is following them everywhere they go. They’re funny, entertaining, gorgeous, and friendly, and together, they’ll enjoy running the social scene like it’s their job. Leo is also whip-smart, so they’ll be able to keep up with Sag in conversation, which is huge. Leo, though, is a romantic at heart. Over time, they might start craving more mushiness and sweet gestures than Sag, so these two will have to compromise. Plus, just because Leo can keep up with Sag doesn’t mean that they’ll want to. Leo likes things their way, so if these two don’t share the same interests, Sag might find that their needs take a backseat."

      "title": "Cancer & Sagittarius.",
      "content": "Cancer & Sagittarius. Ever heard that “opposites attract”? Cancer and Sag are the kind of mismatched couple that can truly complement each other. Cancer is a nurturing homebody with a sentimental heart; Sagittarius is a fiery trailblazer who prefers action to emotion. together, they can actually be a great pair—Sag coaxes Cancer from their shell, and Cancer warms Sagittarius’ restless heart. These two could be a great match! The operative phrase here: “could be.” First, they’ll have to make a romance happen. Sensitive Cancer and super blunt Sag will have to weather miscommunications and tension, but if they can manage it, a beautiful romance will be their reward."

      "title": "Pisces & Sagittarius.",
      "content": "Pisces & Sagittarius. In a way, these two are the childlike souls of the zodiac. A Pisces-Sagittarius couple will enjoy dreamy outdoor days, silly games, and shared fantasies. Good-natured and warm, they have tons of kindness and joy to offer the other. Both signs will bask in the others’ light, because Sag and Pisces are as sunny as it gets. But romantically, Sagittarius might struggle to give Pisces what they want most. Pisces craves a dependable, emotional partner (and the average Sag is 0/2). On the other hand, Sag might get tired of tip-toeing around Pisces’ feelings. On the whole, these two have a ton to offer each other, and they can absolutely make it work. But compromise and intentional effort will be crucial!"

      "title": "Virgo & Sagittarius.",
      "content": "Virgo & Sagittarius. Compatibility isn’t the highest here, but at their best, Virgo and Sagittarius can create a warm, devoted romance. Both of these signs are ultra-independent, which can work in their favor—they’re likely to respect the other’s passions, and allow them tons of freedom. These signs are capable and adaptable, which means that neither will rely too heavily on their partner, and fights will rarely spin out of control. That said, these two will need to find common values, interests, or hobbies to enjoy a deeper connection, as they tend to seek out opposite things in love. Or, if the rest of their chart offers more compatibility, that could be a game-changer, too. In short: this matchup isn’t explosive, but it might lack a natural spark. So as long as they find a point of true connection outside of their sun signs, Virgo and Sag will be all set."
    },
    {
      "title": "Taurus & Sagittarius.",
      "content": "Taurus & Sagittarius. The attraction here is strong, but the compatibility could be…difficult. Taurus and Sagittarius are energetic and gorgeous, but otherwise, totally different from one another. The gulf between them might challenge their connection, but it could also bring about a sense of mystery that’s too captivating to ignore. The spark is here (especially between the sheets), but communication, goal-setting, and commitment will be very difficult. Taurus wants devoted romance and routine, Sag wants freedom and spontaneous fun. That said, for many people finding the “spark” is the challenging part. And that’s not an issue here. Neither Sag nor Taurus is known for rolling over in the face of conflict, but if these two can learn to manage fights in a healthy way, a happy relationship is possible."

    {
      "title": "Capricorn & Sagittarius.",
      "content": "Capricorn & Sagittarius. Capricorn is all business, and Sagittarius is all fun. These two might not have the natural goods for a blossoming relationship, with Cap seeming too stuffy for Sag and Sag, too flighty for Cap. Generally speaking, Capricorn wants status, whereas Sagittarius wants experience. This difference could cause trouble in romance. It’s worth mentioning that these signs are each smart and ambitious in their own way though—Capricorn in their career, Sagittarius in their adventures. If the rest of their charts look compatible, that would be enough to bridge the gap. Oddly enough, Sagittarius and Capricorn have high communication compatibility, because they’re smart, honest, and logical signs. If, for instance, Sagittarius and Capricorn both shared compatible Venus and Ascendant signs, they’d probably be in good shape."

    {
      "title": "Scorpio & Sagittarius.",
      "content": "Scorpio & Sagittarius. These two have a tough road ahead together. Scorpio is emotional and at times, a little controlling; Sagittarius hates the heavy stuff and refuses to play by others’ rules. If they’re not careful, Sag and Scorpio could infuriate each other in the short term and disappoint each other in the long term. But it might not matter—Scorpio and Sag are unlikely to make it that far anyway, as these two are truly very different. But is all hope lost? Not by a long shot! Scorpio and Sag will admire one another’s sharp intellect and expansive curiosity. When they stay civil, discussions will flourish. Plus, their sexual compatibility is off the charts, as these are two of the spiciest signs in the zodiac. And that means a lot to both signs. There is certainly room for a relationship to work well, so long as the rest of their charts are compatible. Before you give up, try to get a sense of the entire picture."
