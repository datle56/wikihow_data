      "content": "Pick a dealer and give each player boards and chips. The dealer is in charge of shuffling and drawing cards from the deck. Meanwhile, players should get a game board, each of which has the same chance of winning the game. Then, make sure each player also has a handful of poker chips—some rulesets recommend around 20 per player. [1] X Research source Additionally, if there are any game boards left over after the players all pick one, the dealer can also take one for themselves and play along, too."

Then, if the card matches one of the spaces on a player’s board, that player can cover the space with a poker chip. [2] X Research source"

The goal of the basic Po-Ke-No game is for players to try and get five spaces covered in a row on their boards. So, have the dealer keep pulling cards and calling them out, with players adding chips to their boards. The first player to get five in a row must yell “Out!” (or, alternatively, “Po-Ke-No!”), and they win the round. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Choose a scoring method to reward winners each round. There are a couple of different ways to handle scoring. First: the simpler method is to give the winner of a round all the chips on other players’ boards (including their own). Second: give the winner a reward equal to the Poker Value of their hand. The suggested values of different Poker hands includes: [4] X Research source Royal Straight Flush (Ace, King, Queen, Jack, 10 - one suit): 9 chips Straight Flush (Five cards in sequence, same suit): 8 chips Four of a Kind (Four cards in the same denomination): 7 chips Full House (Three of one kind plus two of one kind): 6 chips Flush (Five cards of the same suit, not in sequence): 5 chips Straight (Five cards in numerical sequence, mixed suits): 4 chips Three of a Kind (Three cards, same denomination): 3 chips Two Pairs : 2 chips One Pair : 1 chip"

You can decide how many rounds to play beforehand, or just keep playing as many rounds as you like. [5] X Research source It’s not required for players to switch up game boards after picking one at the start of the game, but they can choose to do so if they want."

Label the pots “Corners,” “Centers,” “Five in a Row” and “Four of a Kind,” respectively. You can opt for different labels based on the Poker values listed above, but these four are fairly standard. If you want to play Po-Ke-No for money, using these pots is highly recommended for organization! [6] X Research source “ Centers ” happen when a player covers the center space on their game board. “ Corners ” happen when a player covers the four corners of their game board. “ Five in a Row ” happens when a player covers 5 spaces in a row across their game board. This can be diagonally, horizontally, or vertically. “ Four of a Kind ” happens when a player has four cards of the same denomination, such as 4 Jacks. Other labels for pots include Straight Flush, Full House, Flush, Straight, Three of a Kind, Two Pairs, and One Pair."

Pots can be worth as little as 1 cent and typically are worth no more than 25 cents (as this makes the game more fun), but it’s up to you! The lower each pot is worth, the longer the game can go on. [7] X Research source Whatever you decide, add money to each pot equal to its assigned value before beginning the game."

Play the game as described above—except, when a player yells “Po-Ke-No!” it’s a signal that they’ve won one of the pots. That means a player can call out when they think they have centers, corners, five in a row or four of a kind, and once their board is verified, they win the round (and the corresponding pot). [8] X Research source Players can count how much money they have at the end of the game and subtract how much they started with to determine who the overall winner was. If players want to end the game but still have money in the pots, they can either divide the remaining money in the pots evenly or play one final round called “cover-all.” In the “cover-all” round, remaining pots are combined and the game continues until one player covers their entire game board."

[9] X Research source As a reward, winners can either get all the other player’s chips, or a number of chips from each player equal to the value of their winning hand."

The first player to score in all 4 corners of the board gets 4 points. The first player to get five cards in a row gets 5 points. Finally, the first player to get 5 points wins the game!"

Then, players get started by making a wager—placing a chip on any card (covering two rows, one vertical and one horizontal). As the dealer calls cards, players can only place chips on the spaces within the two covered rows. [12] X Research source If nobody gets 5 cards in a row after the dealer calls 25 cards, the dealer wins the game.

You’re just using playing cards instead of numbers for bingo! [13] X Research source"
