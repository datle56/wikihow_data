Epsom salts are widely recognized for their ability to reduce pain and swelling. These will also help soften the toenail. Try adding 3 tbsp (75 g) of Epsom salt to about 2 US qt (1.9 l) of warm water. [2] X Expert Source Mark Co, DPM Podiatrist Expert Interview. 21 April 2020.

      "content": "Use cotton or floss to gently lift the nail edge. After you soak your foot, the toenail should be softened. Carefully work a piece of clean dental floss under the edge of your nail. Lift up the edge of the toenail gently so that it does not grow further into your skin. Try this approach after every foot soak. Use a clean length of floss each time. Depending on the extent of your ingrown toenail, this might be a little painful. Try taking a pain reliever to ease your discomfort. Don’t dig too much into your toenail. You can cause more infection, which may require medical intervention. Also, if you cut your toenail, don't rip at it or cause any bleeding, as that will cause more swelling in the area.
