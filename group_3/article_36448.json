      "content": "Find a warm environment, or wait for a temperate day. If you plan to install a replacement mirror after removing your current mirror, drive to a location with a temperature between 50–70 °F (10–21 °C), like a heated garage or a sunny parking spot. If your windshield is too hot or too cold when you go to reinstall a mirror, the adhesive may not work as intended. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Disconnect any wires from the mirror. Some rear view mirrors contain electronic components like digital displays that are connected from the base of the mirror to the car by wiring. If this is the case with your mirror, first remove the casing that covers the wiring. You may need to use a screwdriver to do so. Then, carefully disconnect any wires from the mirror.

      "title": "Slide out or unscrew the rear view mirror from the mount.",
      "content": "Slide out or unscrew the rear view mirror from the mount. Many rear view mirrors aren’t mounted to the windshield itself, but rather to a “button” or a separate mechanism that adheres to the windshield. Some mirrors simply slide up and away from the mount, while others are screwed into it. [3] X Research source If your mirror is attached directly to the windshield, you can continue to the next section without first removing the mirror itself."

      "content": "Spray the area around the mount with 2 parts dish soap, 1 part water. This will help to loosen the adhesive that binds the mount to the windshield. [4] X Research source You can also soak a cotton swab in acetone and swab around the base of the mount."

      "title": "Apply gentle pressure to the mirror mount with a flat pick.",
      "content": "Apply gentle pressure to the mirror mount with a flat pick. Using a Phillips-head screwdriver or a rear view mirror removal tool , carefully apply pressure to the underside of the button. Then, gently twist or use the screwdriver as a lever to pry the mount from the windshield. [5] X Research source If the mount doesn’t release even with a fair amount of pressure, tap the other end of the screwdriver with a rubber mallet until the mount comes away from the windshield. You may need the mirror’s mount later for a replacement mirror and to easily identify which way is up and which face goes on the windshield. [6] X Research source Before you put it down, label the right side up and the inner face with a sticky note."

      "content": "Mark the mount’s position on the windshield. In order to know exactly where the mount was so that you can properly position a replacement and use the mirror as before. Mark the area, which is probably a bit gunked with glue residue, with a felt pen, grease pencil, or a bit of masking tape. [7] X Research source"
