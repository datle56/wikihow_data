      "title": "Prepare yourself and your space for meditation",
      "content": "Prepare yourself and your space for meditation . Turn off your television and your cell phone, and eliminate other external distractions. Use a space in which you feel comfortable and free from the need to complete tasks and other stressors. Set aside designated time to meditate, preferably between twenty minutes and a couple hours, depending on your abilities and preferences. Wear comfortable, loose-fitting clothes that are suitable for your space’s temperature. You’ll want to avoid being distracted by stiff clothing or by being too hot or too cold. Don’t allow birds chirping, cars driving by, and other unavoidable external sounds to interrupt your meditation. Being aware of the world and its interconnections can actually be beneficial to meditation. However, if you live in a location, such as by a subway stop or train track, where noise is dominating your thoughts, you should consider putting on music or a mantra recording, both of which are available on Youtube and other services.

      "content": "Stretch your body. To eliminate stiffness and tension in your body as you sit still to meditate, you should stretch yourself out before beginning. Take a few minutes before meditating to stretch your legs, hips, back, shoulders, and neck. While sitting, hold your legs out straight in front of you and reach for your toes to stretch your calves and hamstrings. Bend your knees while seated and bring the soles of your feet together to stretch your hips and quadriceps."

      "title": "Sit in a comfortable position.",
      "content": "Sit in a comfortable position. Typically, one sits in a seated, cross-legged position when they meditate. Do so only if it’s comfortable for you to sit cross-legged for an extended period of time, and hold your back upright, unbowed but not unnaturally straight. However, consider sitting in a chair or with your back braced by a wall or other object if you are unable to sit cross-legged without discomfort. Remember it's important to wear comfortable clothes that allow you to sit still for a while. You will want to avoid distractions from tension or stiffness in your body. Especially if you are just beginning to practice meditation, it is most important to find a distraction-free, comfortable body position. Sit on a yoga mat, a cushion, or on folded blankets or towels for more comfort."

      "content": "Establish your breathing. Begin your meditation with controlled breathing techniques. Be conscious of your breathing and use each breath you take to focus your intention. Breathe in slowly as you count to four, hold for four, and exhale for four. Let your awareness on your breath help you clear your mind and focus your concentration. As you inhale, consider light flowing through your essence, as life rises through your vertebrae and fills you. [2] X Research source Imagine the energy-filled center at the point where your in-breath fuses with your out-breath. [3] X Research source As you exhale and your breath is out completely, visualize a universal pause in which your particular self vanishes and focus on your interconnectedness with everything around you.

Om inner wisdom. Please guide and help on my way.\" [12] X Research source ”Om” or \"Aum\" is the sacred sound associated with the vibration of the cosmos. It is that which sustains everything that is. In order to enunciate the \"Ah\" sound, first open your mouth wide and imagine the universe's creative moment coursing through your body from deep within you, as if the Om were speaking you, rather than you speaking the sound. [13] X Research source Then, begin to purse the lips and stretch the sound into its latter component, the \"Mmm,\" which also has a slight \"ng\" aspect to its pronunciation. Touch the roof of your mouth with your tongue as you speak the final syllables to symbolize the closing of the process of creation. [14] X Research source"
