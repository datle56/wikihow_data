      "content": "Steam your face . Steaming can help open your pores and make it easier to remove the debris. The heat from the steam will soften the hardened oils in your pores, allowing you to extract them. [1] X Research source After washing your face, pour boiling water into a heat-safe bowl. Add a few drops of essential oils if you’d like. Drape a towel over your head, then bend over the bowl. Allow the steam to seep into your skin for 5-10 minutes. Follow your steam with a nose strip or face mask. If you use essential oils, only add 2-3 drops of oil into the water. Look for an essential oil that meets your skin needs. [2] X Research source Tea tree, ylang ylang, rosemary, and geranium oil are all great options for reducing oil production and clearing away bacteria. Geranium oil also tightens skin, which can help reduce the look of pores. [3] X Research source You can steam your face as often as two times a week."

      "content": "Use nose strips. After you steam your face, use a pore cleaning nose strip to remove the debris. Follow the directions on the product’s packaging to apply and remove the nose strip. Once the strip has dried on your nose, you should pull it away to reveal grey, black, and white specs of oil and dirt that came out of your pores. Rinse your nose afterwards. You can use nose strips as often as every three days, but over use of the strips can cause dryness."

      "content": "Spot treat your nose with a clay mask. While you can use a mask on your entire face, doing so too often can dry out your skin. Your nose or t-zone may be more oily than the rest of your face, and using a clay mask regularly on just your nose can help strip away some of the oils and reduce the look of your pores. [4] X Research source Apply a thin layer of the mask to your nose, and let it dry for several minutes before washing it away. Use your spot treatment mask up to three or four times a week. Reduce your usage if your nose starts to feel dry. If you have combination skin, you can use a clay mask on your whole face one or two times per week, though you should always follow the instructions on your individual mask."

Apply the mixture to your nose and let it dry for 10-15 minutes, then gently remove it with warm water. You will just use the egg white. To separate it from the yolk, break the egg in half. Pour the half that doesn't have the yolk into a bowl. Then gently pour the yolk into the empty half-shell, allowing the remaining white part to flow into the bowl. Use the mask no more than once a week to avoid drying out your skin."

If you have combination skin, you may want to just dab the toner or astringent on your nose or T-zone to prevent drying out the rest of your face. You can use cucumber juice as a natural astringent.

If you get a deep chemical peel, then you will likely not be able to get another treatment. Deep chemical peels are usually only done once, and are traditionally for people with a lot of skin damage. Expect to give your face at least a 48-hour break from makeup and sun exposure after you get a chemical peel. If you get a deep chemical peel, your recovery may be longer."
