      "content": "The twin flame connection helps you feel close, even when apart. Does it ever feel like your twin flame is touching you, even when they’re not physically there? If so, it might be their desire and sexual energy manifesting as a feeling of being touched. This can feel gentle or more intense, like they’re running their hands over your body. You may also hear their voice, even when you’re apart. You might mentally replay previous conversations—or hear your twin flame’s voice as though they’re saying something new. Regardless, hearing your twin flame is another sign of their intense desire and connection to you."

      "content": "Dilated pupils often indicate sexual attraction. Your body gets a boost of oxytocin and dopamine (sometimes called “love hormones”) when you feel attraction to someone, and those hormones cause your pupils to dilate (or grow bigger). So, when your twin flame’s pupils dilate, they're thinking of you sexually. [1] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source"

      "content": "They may reach out if you’re simultaneously yearning for each other. Does your twin flame ever send a message or call right as you’re daydreaming about them? This indicates they were also fantasizing about you and felt compelled to reach out because of the intense desire between you. Romantic relationships with a twin flame are often passionate and tumultuous. You may experience on-again, off-again attraction for one another—or your attraction may be so intense that you need to press pause for a while. No matter how tumultuous the relationship, twin flames are always drawn back together by their sexual and romantic attraction."

      "content": "Your inner wisdom may send subtle signals about your twin flame. Many of the universe’s strongest messages are totally unconscious and intangible—meaning you can’t see or hear them, but only feel them in your gut. In short, if you have a deep, intuitive feeling that your twin flame is thinking of you sexually, it’s probably true. However, you can get confirmation through a psychic. If you have a gut feeling, their readings may reveal that your twin flame is definitely thinking of you sexually!"
