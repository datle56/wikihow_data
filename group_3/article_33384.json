Once they’re gone, shuffle the deck 2-3 times to make sure all the cards are mixed up. There are 2 Jokers in a standard deck of playing cards."

      "content": "Gather 2-5 players and deal all the cards out evenly. Slap Jack works best with 2-5 players, but you could squeeze in an extra 1 or 2. Gather everyone around a table, then deal all the cards face-down, starting with the player to your left and working clockwise around the table. Make sure each player gets the same number of cards, and deal until there are no more cards left in the deck. [1] X Research source Don’t peek at your cards! Keep them face-down in a neat pile in front of you. Set any extra cards face-up in a stack in the middle of the table. These cards will start the game."

The player to the left of the dealer takes the top card off their own stack and places it face-up in the middle of the table, so everyone can see it. This starts the game.

      "content": "Take turns placing a single card face-up on the center stack. Players take turns clockwise around the table. On their turn, a player takes the top card of their personal pile and flips it face-up onto the center stack of cards. Slap Jack is a very fast game, so get ready for things to move rather quickly. Try to keep the center pile neat and tidy, even when the game is moving quickly."

As soon as you see a Jack, reach out and slap the card as quickly as you can! [3] X Research source You don't have to wait until it's your turn to slap a Jack, but keep your hands close to your own pile—no hovering over the middle pile while you wait. The number of cards you win depends on how many cards are played since the last Jack made an appearance."

If you’re the first player to slap a Jack when it appears, take all the cards in the middle of the table (including the Jack) and shuffle them into your own personal pile. More cards means you stay in the game longer. [4] X Research source"

If you hit a card before the Jack is played or slap another card while trying to get to the Jack, you must give the top card of your own pile to the player who played the card. They add this card to the top of their face-down pile, without peeking. For example, if you hit the 8 of Spades instead of the Jack of Clubs, give your top card to the player who played the 8 of Spades. Or, if another player plays a 7 on top of a Jack while you were reaching to slap it, but you slap the 7 instead, you still take the penalty."

You have 1 more chance to redeem yourself and stay in the game by being the first to slap the next Jack. If you do, collect all of the cards in the pile and keep playing.

In this case, play a single round of Rock, Paper, Scissors to decide who gets to take the pile. Or, if another player clearly saw what happened, let them declare a winner and break the tie."

Some groups play with a bonus rule, which is that you can also slap the center pile when you see a “sandwich,” which is a card played between 2 cards of the same number, like a 4 between two 7s. If you spot and slap a sandwich, you take the entire center pile, just like slapping a Jack. [8] X Research source For example, Player A plays a Queen, Player B plays a 6, and Player C plays another Queen. Any player could slap this sandwich to take the pile."

With this rule, players can also slap the pile any time 2 of the same card is played one right after the other, like a 2 and then another 2, or King after a King. This adds a healthy amount of chaos and excitement to the table, but get ready to slap like crazy, since it happens pretty often!"
