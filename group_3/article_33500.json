      "title": "Force your Gemini to contact you, not the other way around.",
      "content": "Force your Gemini to contact you, not the other way around. When this free-spirited air sign plays games, he'll take his time texting you back. Instead of being the first to text every time, maintain radio silence and don't interact with posts on social media while waiting for him to contact you. Give him time to miss you! Soon he'll start wondering where you are and make an effort to call or text. Don't be discouraged if this takes time. You may be waiting on him for a week, as Geminis are easily distracted. However, he'll set aside time to call once he realizes he needs to make you a priority. If he hasn't called or texted you for a week, it might be good to ask him what's up. Don't bombard him, however; just send one quick text and wait for a reply."

      "content": "Send mixed signals to make mercurial Gemini work for your attention. [1] X Research source Gemini is also known for his mixed signals; he often runs hot and then cold, switching between showing interest and acting aloof. You can do it too: give Gemini lots of attention, and when he finally reciprocates, become distant for a few days. Avoid hanging out, and let him sit at home wondering what happened. Gemini is a mutable sign, meaning he's flexible and quick-thinking, but can also be highly indecisive. Playing hard-to-get this way will make Gemini see that he has to fight for your affection if he wants you in his life."

      "title": "Show fun-loving Gemini that you don't need him to have a good time.",
      "content": "Show fun-loving Gemini that you don't need him to have a good time. Try new things, pursue your favorite hobbies, and go on adventures. Post about your activities on social media, so your Gemini can see every cool thing you're doing. A Gemini guy might start avoiding you if he feels stifled in the relationship, so beat him at his own game by acting just as carefree and adventurous as he is. Gemini guys are independent and uncomfortable with clingy partners, so he won't be offended if he sees you having fun without him. On the contrary, it'll make him want to join in. Geminis are easily bored and prefer constant stimulus to keep them entertained. He'll be impressed by you when he sees how fulfilling your life is and make more effort to be part of it."

      "title": "If he sees you getting attention from others, he'll want you to himself.",
      "content": "If he sees you getting attention from others, he'll want you to himself. This sign is social and a natural charmer, so he might get flirty with someone else right in front of you when he's playing games. Thankfully, he'll pursue you with more determination if he realizes you're doing the same. Flirt with someone where your Gemini can see you, and you'll see how territorial he becomes. Be careful not to overdo it; openly breaking things off and going on dates with new people won't win him over, but attracting interest from other guys and engaging in some light flirting can."

      "content": "Make plans and keep them, rather than canceling for your Gemini. He can be downright flaky when playing games, so don't rearrange your schedule or prioritize seeing him while trying to get the upper hand. Make time to hang out with your friends instead. This will teach Gemini to move faster if he wants some of your precious time while reinforcing how independent you are. Gemini isn't the most romantic sign and doesn't like being overly attached. He values his personal freedom, so he'll take comfort in knowing you can do your own thing while you're together."

Just make sure you feel good in whatever you're wearing, and he'll think you look good too. If you have something unique to wear, try that out. He'll admire your ability to stand out from the crowd."

Show him that he doesn't know everything about you yetâ€”but if he sticks around, he could. Geminis are inquisitive by nature, so he'll be chomping at the bit to learn more! You don't need to be evasive when he asks you questions; just slowly open up to him and offer fewer details at first."
