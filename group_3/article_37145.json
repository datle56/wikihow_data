      "title": "Find the phone number for animal control.",
      "content": "Find the phone number for animal control. You usually report leash law violations to your city or county’s animal control department. You can find the number in your phone book or on the Internet. Search for “your city” and “animal control” in a search engine. Check if there is a fax number and email address available as well."

      "title": "Report by telephone.",
      "content": "Report by telephone. You should call the number provided and report the leash law violation. In some cities, you will call a general number, such as 3-1-1. Provide as much information as you can about the dog and the owner."
    },
    {
      "title": "Report online.",
      "content": "Report online. Some governments might have online complaint forms that you can fill out. Maricopa county in Arizona, for example, allows you to report leash law violations online, provided you know the animal’s owner. You will be prompted to provide the following information: your name and address your email your telephone number the location of the incident, including street address and major crossroads a description of the animal, including breed, size, color, and age any other relevant information"

    {
      "title": "Meet with an animal control officer.",
      "content": "Meet with an animal control officer. Animal control probably won’t send someone out immediately to investigate. However, you should make yourself available to meet with the officer if requested. Share whatever documentary evidence you have of the violation."
    },
    {
      "title": "Read your local leash law.",
      "content": "Read your local leash law. Your city or county government might publish its leash law. You can find it on the government website or by stopping into the town office and asking for a copy. Pay attention to what constitutes a violation of the law: Does the law apply to only dogs, or to dogs, cats, and other animals? How long does the leash have to be? Does the length of leash differ depending on the breed of the dog? Does the leash law cover only animals out for a walk, or does it also require that dogs be on leashes when in their yards? Can the owner install a physical or electronic fence instead of leashing the animal? Is there a designated off-leash park where people can take their dogs?"
    },
    {
      "title": "Write down the name of the dog’s owner.",
      "content": "Write down the name of the dog’s owner. If you see an unleashed animal in someone’s yard, then note the address. If the person is out walking their dog off the leash, then check if you can identify the owner. Your animal control will need an address in order to reach out to the animal owner."
    },
    {
      "title": "Take pictures or video.",
      "content": "Take pictures or video. This is fairly easy if the animal is left unleashed in its yard. Make sure that the date stamp on the picture or video reflects the actual date. However, be careful about taking video of a person, even in public. In many states, it is illegal to record someone’s conversation without their permission. For this reason, you shouldn’t videotape someone walking their unleashed dog in public since you might accidentally record a confidential conversation they are having with another person. [1] X Research source Generally, you could still take pictures of someone in public space, such as a park or on the street."

    {
      "title": "Document if the dog threatened you.",
      "content": "Document if the dog threatened you. The dog might have rushed you or, worse, actually bitten you. You should document any damage the unleashed dog has caused. You can bring a lawsuit for dog bites, if you are sufficiently injured. If a dog caused you to fall off a bicycle or crash your car, then document the injuries suffered. Get medical records and repair estimates. Also take vivid color photographs of your injuries. [2] X Research source"
