It's up to you to find someone willing to mentor you for the next four years without receiving any pay or even continuing education credit. The attorney or judge you choose must be admitted to the active practice of law in California, and have been in good standing for at least five years. You will not be working for your mentor. Rather, you will be following a course of study proposed by the attorney or judge, who will personally supervise you at least five hours a week. Try to study law under an attorney who practices the same type of law you want to practice after you pass the bar exam. Your mentor also must examine you at least once a month on the material you studied that month. Once every six months, your mentor will report to the Committee of Bar Examiners the hours you studied each week and the subjects and materials you studied."
