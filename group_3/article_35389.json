      "title": "Check for lethargy and/or confusion.",
      "content": "Check for lethargy and/or confusion. A cat in shock might not recognize their surroundings or housemates. They might also stagger or fall from being off balance. Their energy level could range from low to non-existent. They won't respond if you try to play with them or open a can of food. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Look for an irregular heart rate. The normal heart rate for calm adult cats is 110-130 beats per minute (bpm). For kittens, it's 180-220 bpm. [2] X Research source Cats in the early stages of shock might have an abnormally high heart rate. It might then slow to a weak, slow rate. If your cat has no pulse, administer CPR immediately. [3] X Research source To check your cat's pulse, place your hand on their chest just behind the left elbow. Count each heartbeat for 15 seconds. Multiply that number by four. [4] X Research source If your cat is excited or scared, such as when they are in an unfamiliar situation or have just experienced trauma, they may have an abnormally high heart rate. The cat's pulse should be strong and easy to feel. If the pulse is weak or feels like it is getting weaker, then it is another sign of shock."

      "title": "Check for rapid breathing.",
      "content": "Check for rapid breathing. On average, calm, healthy cats take 16 to 40 breaths per minute. A cat in shock will take more than 40 breaths per minute. However, the breaths will be shallow. If your cat stops breathing, perform CPR immediately. [5] X Research source To calculate your cat's breathing rate, count the number of times your cat's chest rises (inhaling) or falls (exhaling) in 15 seconds. Multiply that number by four. Don't count both rising and falling, as this will give you an inaccurate rate. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Test for hypothermia.",
      "content": "Test for hypothermia. Cats in shock experience a drop in body temperature. Feel your cat's limbs and the underside of their paws. If they feel cold to the touch, wrap your cat in a towel or blanket. Call the vet immediately. [7] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Look for pale skin and discolored gums.",
      "content": "Look for pale skin and discolored gums. When a cat is in shock, blood will be drawn away from their nose and tongue. This causes both sources of exposed skin to become pale. Their gums will darken to a dark pink at first. As blood withdraws from the area, the gums will turn gray or white. [8] X Research source"

      "title": "Test for poor circulation.",
      "content": "Test for poor circulation. Press your finger against your cat's gums for a second. When you remove it, you should see a white patch where your finger was. This test is called capillary refill time (CRT). If it takes more than 2 seconds to become pink again, your cat's blood circulation is abnormally low. Call your vet immediately. [9] X Research source It is possible for a cat to have a normal CRT and still be in shock. Normal CRT is 1-2 seconds. In the early stage of shock, CRT may be less than 1 second. This can become a normal 1-2 seconds in the middle stage of shock. In the late stage of shock, CRT will be greater than 2 seconds. You may want to repeat the test to double check your results."

      "content": "Check for dehydration. If your cat has experienced prolonged vomiting or diarrhea, they might be dehydrated. Gently take the skin between your cat's shoulder blades and pull it upward. The skin should fall back into place after you release it. If it fails to fall back after two seconds, your cat is likely dehydrated and needs immediate veterinary attention. [10] X Research source"

      "content": "Seek veterinary help immediately. Shock can kill quickly. Immediately after your cat has sustained a major injury, such as being hit by a car or receiving a deep cut, take them to your vet or local animal hospital. Do this even if your cat seems okay following the incident. If shock comes about as the result of heat exhaustion or allergies, seek out your vet as soon as your cat starts to act lethargic or confused. When shock is caught in its early stages, your cat will have a better chance of survival. [11] X Research source"

If you don't have access to gauze, use a clean towel to wrap the wound. [12] X Research source Avoid hydrogen peroxide or rubbing alcohol. These substances can damage the injured skin even further.

Keep their head at a lower level than their heart by placing towels under their torso. This will direct blood flow to their brain. [15] X Research source If you suspect your cat may have a head injury, do not let its head rest lower than its heart unless you are directed to do so by a vet."

Injured cats might seem okay at first, but shock can set in quickly and cause rapid deterioration in your cat's health. Don't leave anything to chance. When in doubt, get your cat to your vet or nearest animal hospital. [21] X Research source"
