      "content": "Wash the hood with soap and water. Pick a day when you have time to devote to painting the car. Start by washing the hood to clear away grime. Use a car wash soap purchased from an automotive store, then rinse it off with water from a hose. [1] X Research source Household soaps aren’t recommended since they tend to damage the finish."

      "title": "Rub the hood with a sanding sponge.",
      "content": "Rub the hood with a sanding sponge. You can find sanding sponges at any home improvement store. While the car is wet, gently rub the sponge over the hood. This cuts into the paint, which helps the new coating adhere better when you apply it later. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Dry the car completely in sunlight.",
      "content": "Dry the car completely in sunlight. You can use a clean microfiber cloth to absorb most of the moisture. No matter what, leave the car out in direct sunlight until all the water is gone. This can take a few hours, depending on the weather. [3] X Research source The car has to be dry or else your new coat of paint won’t look very good."

      "title": "Use sandpaper to rub off any rust spots you notice.",
      "content": "Use sandpaper to rub off any rust spots you notice. Pick up some 40 to 60-grit sandpaper from a home improvement store. Rub it back and forth over the rusted spots. You will notice the orange-colored rust begin to flake off. Continue working until it’s gone and all you’re left with is bare metal. [4] X Research source It’s important to remove rust now so it doesn’t damage your car later. A grinder can be used in place of sandpaper if you have one."

    {
      "title": "Wipe the sanded areas with a damp cloth.",
      "content": "Wipe the sanded areas with a damp cloth. Find a clean microfiber cloth and hold it under running water. Avoid soaking the cloth, since introducing too much water to the metal leads to more rust. Use the cloth to remove debris from the spots you sanded. [5] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Spray the rusted areas with a rust converter.",
      "content": "Spray the rusted areas with a rust converter. Next, pick up a can of a rust converter and primer product from a home improvement center or automotive store. It operates like spray paint. Press the plunger on top of the can and move it from side to side over the exposed metal. Create a nice, even coat to protect the metal. [6] X Research source This product acts as a primer. You can paint over it."

      "title": "Cover the rest of the car with tape and plastic sheeting.",
      "content": "Cover the rest of the car with tape and plastic sheeting. Home improvement stores usually stock sheeting, as do some paint stores and auto parts shops. Cover up any areas near the hood that you don’t want painted. Masking tape is good for covering the edges around the hood. Plastic sheeting is better for covering large areas. [7] X Research source"

      "title": "Wear a respirator when painting the car.",
      "content": "Wear a respirator when painting the car. No matter what type of paint you use, the fumes are unpleasant and dangerous to inhale. Moving the car to an open, outdoor location is a good idea, but you should still put on a respirator mask to be safe. Safety goggles and gloves are also helpful."

You will need a can of primer and a can of colored paint. [8] X Research source If you want to add more detail to the hood, also get another color of paint."

A gun gives you more control, helping you create more even paint layers. You will need to get liquid paint and mix it according to the instructions on the label. [9] X Research source"

Start at 1 end and slowly move the can or gun in a straight line towards the other end. Then reverse, overlapping this second stroke with your first one. Continue spraying back and forth to cover the entire hood. [10] X Research source Another way to do this is with a quality liquid primer. Spread it over the hood with a plastic paint spreader."

      "content": "Wait up to 5 minutes after applying a layer. For primer, wait between 2 to 5 minutes before applying more. Each can of primer or paint requires some waiting for the product to settle on the hood. Check the instructions on the can to remind yourself of how long to wait. Don’t wait too long, though. The primer should only be allowed to dry after you’re done adding more of it."

      "content": "Apply the main coat of paint. This mid coat is the color you primarily want your car to be. Apply it the same way you did the primer. Start at 1 end of the hood and move across it in an even stroke. If you’re using spray paint, try releasing the plunger when you reach the hood's edges. [11] X Research source Slow, straight lines are the way to get good coloring. Moving too fast means thin, faded streaks that will make you want to hide your car in the garage forever."

Once that time has elapsed, apply another coat of paint to the hood. It will take you 2 or 3 coats to make the hood look perfect. [12] X Research source"
