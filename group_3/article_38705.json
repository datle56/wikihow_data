If the check gets lost or stolen, the thief can make the check out to themselves for any amount they want. Additionally, never send a check made out to “Cash.” These checks can be cashed by anyone. It's important to fill out the check information carefully and correctly to protect yourself. Unfortunately, check fraud through the postal system is a fairly common problem. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Avoid writing unnecessary personal information on your check. Don’t write your Social Security number on a check. You also don’t need to include your driver’s license number, home address, credit card number, or phone number on a check. If you're paying a bill, you don't need to include the last few digits of the account number on your check unless the company that you're paying requires it. You can include non-personal information in the \"Description\" field if you want to, but most banks don't pay much attention to this field when cashing checks. The more personal information you include on a check, the easier it is for someone to steal your identity. Once they do, they can open a new checking account or even apply for a credit card or loan in your name.

      "title": "Fold a piece of paper around the check before slipping it in an envelope.",
      "content": "Fold a piece of paper around the check before slipping it in an envelope. Envelope paper is quite thin and it's easy for thieves to see the check inside without even having to break the seal. To keep the contents of your mail private, wrap a piece of paper around the check before tucking it into the envelope. [3] X Research source If you're paying a bill, folding the payment slip around the check should be fine. However, for extra protection, wrap a blank piece of paper around the payment slip and your check. If you're including a check inside of a greeting card, you shouldn't need to wrap it in a blank piece of paper first."

      "title": "Seal the envelope securely to prevent theft.",
      "content": "Seal the envelope securely to prevent theft. Hold the envelope up to the light before you seal it to make sure a single piece of paper is enough to obscure your check. If everything looks good, go ahead and seal the envelope. You might want to use tape in addition to the adhesive on the envelope seal for extra protection. You can use security envelopes to mail checks if you want additional extra peace of mind. However, if you're paying a bill, a return envelope is usually included that you're supposed to use when mailing in your payment."

      "content": "Mail the check in person at the post office. Never put a check in your mailbox overnight as outgoing mail. This is one of the most common ways that criminals steal checks and commit fraud. Bring your well-sealed check payment to the post office and give it directly to a postal worker to protect yourself. Thieves often steal checks from mailboxes, endorse them, and make photocopies. This allows them to cash the same check repeatedly. [4] X Research source If you're paying a bill, make sure that your check is in the mail before the due date. Some companies use the postmark stamp as the due date."
