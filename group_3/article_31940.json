    {
      "title": "Most of the time, feelings of neediness are rooted in fear.",
      "content": "Most of the time, feelings of neediness are rooted in fear. Think about how you would feel if the person you’re dependent on left. Ask yourself what in particular scares you about that scenario. [1] X Research source For instance, if you’re emotionally dependent on the person you’re dating, you might have an underlying fear of feeling unlovable."
    },
    {
      "title": "Get in touch with your inner mind.",
      "content": "Get in touch with your inner mind. Find a time when you won’t be interrupted, and sit quietly with yourself for a while. Notice where your mind goes and what kind of urges you experience. You may find some thought patterns or habits you weren’t previously aware of. [2] X Research source Don’t distract yourself by checking your phone or tidying your room when you do this exercise. Devote all your attention to introspection, even if it’s uncomfortable."
    },
    {
      "title": "Embrace your truest self.",
      "content": "Embrace your truest self. Think about who you really are when you’re not trying to please anybody else. Identify your core values, the things you want to achieve, and your idiosyncrasies. Work on building a sense of self that doesn’t depend on external validation. [3] X Research source If you don’t have a strong sense of identity, step out of your comfort zone and explore some new things by yourself. See which activities, people, and ideas resonate with you."
    },
    {
      "title": "Channel your energy into taking control of your own choices and thoughts.",
      "content": "Channel your energy into taking control of your own choices and thoughts. When you depend too much on other people, you may end up trying to control them – or feeling miserable because you can’t. Accept that other people have the right to their own thoughts, feelings, and choices, and realize that these won’t always involve you. [4] X Research source For example, if you get jealous when your friend wants to spend time with other people, don’t try to guilt-trip them. Take a deep breath, remember that people can have many friends, and think about what you’ll do with your free time instead."
    },
    {
      "title": "Talk to someone you can trust.",
      "content": "Talk to someone you can trust. If you feel locked in a cycle of emotional dependency and can’t manage to break out on your own, don’t be afraid to seek help. Talk to a trusted friend or relative, or get help from a counselor or therapist."
    },
    {
      "title": "Dealing with your feelings is your own job, not anybody else’s.",
      "content": "Dealing with your feelings is your own job, not anybody else’s. Realize that, while you may experience your emotions strongly, they don’t define who you are or control what you do. [5] X Research source For example, you shouldn't expect others to stop what they're doing whenever you're in a bad mood or have a tough day. Instead find healthy ways to cope with negative feelings without needing others to \"fix\" it for you. If you can, give yourself a chance to calm down and stabilize a bit before reaching out to a friend."
    },
    {
      "title": "When you feel down, look for healthy ways to soothe yourself.",
      "content": "When you feel down, look for healthy ways to soothe yourself. Try giving yourself a pep talk, going for a walk, or writing in a journal. [6] X Research source Be careful not to replace one type of dependency with another. For instance, if you have anxiety, it’s not a good idea to start using alcohol to calm yourself down. If you do find yourself turning to alcohol or other substances for emotional reasons, seek help from a doctor or mental health specialist."
    },
    {
      "title": "Feeling better about yourself can help you overcome the need for others' approval.",
      "content": "Feeling better about yourself can help you overcome the need for others' approval. Take stock of the things you like about yourself, and remind yourself of your good qualities frequently. Increase your self-esteem by challenging yourself to try new things and finding ways to help others. Your self-talk is a big component of your self-esteem. Instead of criticizing yourself, talk to yourself in a friendly, encouraging way. Say things like \"I can do this. I am a capable person. I am in charge of my destiny. Whatever happens, I will do my best.\""
    },
    {
      "title": "Look for the good in people, and keep your expectations reasonable.",
      "content": "Look for the good in people, and keep your expectations reasonable. Don’t get angry if someone occasionally disappoints you. Remind yourself that everyone has their own strengths and weaknesses. For example, no one is perfect. If a friend forgets your plans, give them the benefit of the doubt, especially if it's a one-off. Otherwise, it's like you expect everyone to be flawless while you are entitled to make mistakes."
    },
    {
      "title": "Ask yourself what kind of life you want to live.",
      "content": "Ask yourself what kind of life you want to live. Then, make a plan that will help you get there. Prioritize your own goals and values instead of trying to please other people. [7] X Research source Don’t confuse fulfillment with getting lots of attention from the person you’re emotionally dependent on. Think about what would make you happy even if they weren’t in your life. Create and pursue your own goals, rather than trying to meet other people’s expectations."
    },
    {
      "title": "Plan your schedule based on your own needs and wishes.",
      "content": "Plan your schedule based on your own needs and wishes. Incorporate time for self-care and activities you enjoy, like visiting friends or going out to the movies. Don’t let other people’s plans dictate your life. [8] X Research source For instance, if your significant other goes home to visit their family, don’t mope about being alone. Find fun or productive things to do with your free time instead."
    },
    {
      "title": "Try to spend time with lots of different people.",
      "content": "Try to spend time with lots of different people. Stay in touch with your family, and make plans to see your friends regularly. If your social circle is small, you can meet new people through work, classes, or social clubs."
    },
    {
      "title": "When you help other people, you’ll feel dependable, not dependent.",
      "content": "When you help other people, you’ll feel dependable, not dependent. Reach out to your family and friends when they need some extra support, or look for volunteer opportunities in your area. [9] X Research source Help other people simply for the sake of helping them. If you expect something in return, you’re still in a dependent mindset."
    },
    {
      "title": "Step back and think about what you want in life.",
      "content": "Step back and think about what you want in life. This might mean doing something as simple as finishing a household task (like painting your room), or it could mean taking steps toward a major life goal (like applying to go back to school)."
    },
    {
      "title": "Dependency isn’t healthy, but neither is emotional isolation.",
      "content": "Dependency isn’t healthy, but neither is emotional isolation. As you break free of your old habits, seek out emotionally healthy people to spend time with. Cultivate relationships based on mutual respect, honesty and empathy, not neediness. For example, try to brainstorm some solutions to your personal problems a bit before running to others for advice. This helps you learn how to problem-solve while also taking into consideration that others might have practical advice, too. If you are really feeling stuck, seek help from a therapist."
