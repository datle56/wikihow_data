      "content": "Purchase your Nintendog from the kennel. This is the first thing you do at the beginning of the game. Select a breed, colour and gender you like. Pay close attention to the personality descriptions- if it's your first time playing the game, avoid dogs described as tomboyish, naughty, boisterous etc. Instead, opt for dogs that are described as being patient and having a good temperament. This makes teaching your dog it's name much easier, as well as teaching it tricks later on. If the ideal dog doesn't show up, simply exit out of the selection screen and click on the breed again to have a new randomized set."

      "content": "Move on to the next steps and begin thinking of a name for your dog. The best names are between two and four syllables, and sound very distinct. Don't choose something too short like \"Bee\" or \"Pip\" (while they may be cute) or \"Captain Death Overlord the Third\" (even though it may sound epic). Too long or too short names make it hard for your dog to learn it's name. Cute names may be foods like \"Toffee\", flowers like \"Daisy\", human names like \"Maxwell\" or anything you can imagine!"

If your dog understands what you said, a faint yellow light will appear around it and a chime will sound. If it's confused, orange question marks appear and a mumbled noise will sound. If your dog keeps being confused, you aren't pronouncing it identically each time. You may want to rethink it's name if it's not working."
