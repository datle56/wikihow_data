  "steps": [
    {
      "title": "Imagine…",
      "content": "Imagine… With this phrase, you can encourage someone to put themselves in the situation you’re describing, then follow up with the example you want them to envision. You can also use “imagine” in different phrases; for instance, you could say, “Imagine a scenario where…” and then continue with your example. [1] X Research source Example: Imagine a scenario where you need to find a new job. You might use online job boards, job fairs, and company websites to do it. Use in: Informal writing (or speech) with people you already know—coworkers, friends, and so on."
    },
    {
      "title": "Consider…",
      "content": "Consider… Use “consider” to pose a hypothetical scenario for people to imagine themselves in (much like the “imagine” alternative explained above). You can use “consider” in different phrases, like “Consider a situation in which” or “Consider a scenario where…”, depending on what you want to say. [2] X Research source Example: Consider a situation where you’re struggling to manage your time. Keeping a to-do list can help you stay on track. Use in: Formal or informal situations."
    },
    {
      "title": "Including…",
      "content": "Including… Use “Including” right before you list several examples (meaning it’s usually for groups, rather than just one example). [3] X Research source Example: The company recalled several dairy products, including butter, yogurt, and sour cream. Use in: Formal writing or speech (though it can also be used informally)."
    },
    {
      "title": "Like…",
      "content": "Like… “Like” is used to compare one thing to another (or several different things). Although it’s a little different from “For example,” you can still use it when you want to list particular examples related to the original topic. [4] X Research source Example: There are many ways to volunteer, like working with a soup kitchen, animal shelter, or library. Use in: Informal writing and speech. “Like” is definitely a more casual term—it shouldn’t be used in academic or business writing."
    },
    {
      "title": "Namely…",
      "content": "Namely… “Namely” is an ideal alternative in situations where you want to use a particular example that fits into whatever you’re discussing. [5] X Research source Example: We’re looking for a candidate with several different skills, namely tech proficiency, adaptability, and coaching abilities. Use in: Formal writing or speech."
    },
    {
      "title": "Pretend…",
      "content": "Pretend… This alternative to “For example” works just like “Imagine.” Use it when asking readers or listeners to put themselves in a specific situation, one that serves as an example of what you’re talking about. Example: Meal prep is super important. Pretend you spend an hour on meal prep every weekend—would that make it easier to cook on weekdays? Use in: Mainly informal situations."
    },
    {
      "title": "Specifically…",
      "content": "Specifically… This is another alternative word (like “Namely”) that can be used to give detailed examples attached to a broader statement. [6] X Research source Example: There are so many ways to get enough vitamin D—specifically, sunlight exposure and dietary sources like fish and eggs. Use in: Formal or informal situations."
    },
    {
      "title": "Suppose…",
      "content": "Suppose… Use “Suppose” when asking people to imagine a possible scenario (when that scenario is also an example illustrating the point you’re trying to make). By putting the other person into the scenario, you’re also making them the main character—which can help keep them attentive . Example: The importance of networking in business can’t be overstated. Suppose you want to look for a new job or collaborate with another company. Networking can pave the way for both. Use in: Formal or informal writing and speech."
    },
    {
      "title": "Additionally…",
      "content": "Additionally… When you use “Additionally,” you can add examples or more information to a previous statement. It’s not exactly like “For example,” but it can be used in similar ways!

    },
    {
      "title": "Consequently…",
      "content": "Consequently… Use “Consequently” to explain an example of something that happened as a direct result of something else. After all, the word “consequence” implies a cause and effect. Example: I struggled to keep my workspace organized last month. Consequently, here’s the system I used this month. Use in: Mainly formal writing or speech."
    },
    {
      "title": "Take…",
      "content": "Take… The longer way to say this would be “Take, for instance…” (but you don’t necessarily need the “for instance”). You can use this when you’re about to give a specific example or evidence of something. Example: Take the case of our successful marketing campaign, for instance. We could apply that strategy to other campaigns, too. Use in: Mainly informal situations, but potentially some formal ones as well."
    },
    {
      "title": "As proof…",
      "content": "As proof… When you use this phrase, you’re announcing that you’re about to prove your point. You could then follow up with an anecdote, fact, or statistic supporting the point you made. Example: We strongly believe in this project—and as proof, we gathered the following evidence to showcase its positive impact on the community. Use in: Formal or informal situations (up to you)."
    },
    {
      "title": "As documented…",
      "content": "As documented… Use “As documented” to give an example that’s been proven or documented as evidence. In other words, you’re using this phrase to tell people that your examples are factual and supported by research or data. Example: As documented on this chart, we’ve seen a marked change in industry trends over the past year. Use in: Formal (especially academic) writing or speech. Similar phrases: You can use several similar phrases interchangeably with “As documented” when you want even more variety in your writing."
    },
    {
      "title": "As indicated…",
      "content": "As indicated… This is a great alternative to use when you’re offering data that backs up your point. Just make your point, then write “...as indicated by,” followed by the supporting evidence. Example: We’re on the right track with our current strategy, as indicated by last month’s numbers. Use in: Formal situations."
    },
    {
      "title": "As suggested…",
      "content": "As suggested… Use this alternative when you’re reporting on the results of an experiment or study. “Suggested” indicates that while something may not be set in stone, there’s data indicating that it’s correct. Example: People tend to prefer ads with humor and creativity, as suggested by the poll we took. Use in: Mainly formal writing or speech."
    },
    {
      "title": "As revealed…",
      "content": "As revealed… This is another phrase you can use when proving a point. “As revealed” tells people that there’s proof of whatever you’re saying, or that you’ve discovered information that supports your argument.

    },
    {
      "title": "As evidenced by…",

    },
    {
      "title": "As you can see…",
      "content": "As you can see… You could use this phrase when presenting written or visual information, like a chart or the results of a study. “As you can see” indicates there’s something for people to look at and see the example you’re talking about. Example: He has a cold, as you can see based on his congestion and high temperature. Use in: Formal or informal situations."
    },
    {
      "title": "As seen in…",
      "content": "As seen in… Like “As you can see,” this phrase implies that your example can be found somewhere—a study or even a piece of media or writing. You can use it to present specific evidence supporting the point that you’re making. Example: As seen in this study, public opinion is rapidly changing. Use in: Mainly formal writing or speech."
    },
    {
      "title": "Case in point…",
      "content": "Case in point… “Case in point” indicates that you’re about to explain something that’ll prove your point. So, using it is simple—after making your point, write “Case in point…” followed by your example. This is especially effective when you make a daring or controversial argument. Example: Mentorship can be very beneficial for young professionals. Case in point: I got my dream job after working with a mentor. Use in: Formal or informal situations."
    },
    {
      "title": "Examples include…",
      "content": "Examples include… This one is relatively close to the original “For example,” but it’s still an alternate way to phrase the words. Use it to list several examples simultaneously (rather than just sharing one or two). Example: Examples of different fabrics include linen, wool, polyester, and cotton. Use in: Formal or academic situations."
    },
    {
      "title": "“By way of example…”",
      "content": "“By way of example…” Use this phrase to share an example connected to your argument. It’s basically a slightly fancier way to say “For example”! Example: This technology will help us streamline business. By way of example, here are testimonials from other businesses. Use in: Formal writing and speech."
    },
    {
      "title": "“As a sample…”",
      "content": "“As a sample…” “Sample” isn’t quite the same as “example,” but you can use this phrase when your example is a sample of something—like data or research.

    },
    {
      "title": "“As a demonstration…”",
      "content": "“As a demonstration…” “As a demonstration” is a little different than the standard “For example.” It’s an ideal phrase to use when you have a physical or visual presentation to show people (rather than a list of examples to write about). Example: The more care you put into your cooking, the better it is. As a demonstration, here’s how we make pancakes. Use in: Formal and academic situations."
    },
    {
      "title": "“To exemplify…”",
      "content": "“To exemplify…” “Exemplify” is a term meaning “to give an example” or “to show by example.” Exemplifying something basically just means it’s the perfect example of it—so you can use this term to describe something that’s an exceptionally accurate or good example. Example: We want to grow the business. To exemplify, we plan on hiring at least five more employees and stocking more products. Use in: Formal writing or speech."
    },
    {
      "title": "An example being…",
      "content": "An example being… “An example being” is another close variant of “For example,” which best fits when you want to list one specific example as opposed to several, since it uses “an example” (singular). Example: There are many ways to help people, an example being donating food or unused items. Use in: Formal (especially academic writing ) situations."
    },
    {
      "title": "For instance…",
      "content": "For instance… “For instance” can be used exactly like “For example”—the two are pretty much interchangeable! An “instance” of something is the same thing as an example. [7] X Research source Example: Memory improvement is possible through many techniques. For instance, stress management and mental exercises are both proven to help.

      "title": "For reference…",
      "content": "For reference… Use this phrase when you’re giving someone information they can reference (look at or refer to) to verify what you’re saying. “For reference” can be another way of saying you have proof or evidence that you want people to see. Example: For reference, we gathered the following data from our customers. Use in: Primarily formal, work or academic situations."
    },
    {
      "title": "In fact…",
      "content": "In fact… While “In fact” is a little different from “For example,” you can still use it to present factual information and data that supports your statement. Example: We anticipate high levels of growth in the coming months. In fact, our company’s business has already increased by 70% in the last year. Use in: Formal or informal situations."
    },
    {
      "title": "In particular…",
      "content": "In particular… “In particular” is an alternative you can use when you want to emphasize a specific part of your message or argument.

    },
    {
      "title": "In light of…",
      "content": "In light of… Use “In light of” when presenting evidence, especially if it’s new or might change the reader’s current assumptions. “In light of” is another way of saying you’re “shedding light” on a topic (meaning you’re explaining it more fully with examples). Example: We've decided to change tactics in light of rising gas prices. Use in: Formal (especially business) writing and speech."
    },
    {
      "title": "Let’s say…",
      "content": "Let’s say… Use “Let’s say” to suggest a hypothetical example that illustrates your point. It’s also interchangeable with terms like “imagine” or “Suppose,” since they’re all used to propose scenarios for people to imagine. [9] X Research source Example: Let’s say you get dehydrated halfway through the day. Having a refillable water bottle with you can really help! Use in: Mainly informal situations, although it’s acceptable in most formal writing, too. Alternatively, you don’t even need the “Let’s.” The statement could start with “Say…” or “Say that…” instead."
    },
    {
      "title": "Picture this…",
      "content": "Picture this… This is another prompt you can use when you want people to imagine a scenario (or even put themselves in it). The visualization can get people more engaged with your words! [10] X Research source Example: We need some downtime. Picture this: a sunny beach, a book, some volleyball, and drinks with little umbrellas. Use in: Informal situations."
    },
    {
      "title": "Such as…",
      "content": "Such as… “Such as” is the perfect segue to help you elaborate on a specific topic and explain it in depth. You can use it to lead into an example or a list of examples. [11] X Research source Example: Need date night ideas? There’s plenty to do, such as a dance class, karaoke, or just dinner and drinks. Use in: Formal or informal writing and speech; this phrase can be used in any setting."
    },
    {
      "title": "Think about it as if…",
      "content": "Think about it as if… This phrase encourages readers (or listeners) to consider a different perspective or an alternate argument. By saying “Think about it as if,” you’re asking other people to look at a scenario from a different angle—one you’re describing. Example: Is it good for companies to require employees to commute? Think about it as if you have a job you could do remotely, but your workplace makes you spend gas money on a commute anyway. Use in: Mainly informal writing, though you could use it in business situations with people you know well."
    },
    {
      "title": "This would be like…",
      "content": "This would be like… This is more of a comparative statement (instead of “For example,” which is a little more straightforward). You can use it to give an example of a situation similar to the overall idea you’re discussing. Example: If the company sponsored weekly lunches, this would be like a mixer where employees could get to know one another better. Use in: Mainly informal writing, though you could use it in certain situations at work, too."
    },
    {
      "title": "To clarify…",
      "content": "To clarify… When you use this phrase, give people examples that make your point or argument clearer and more understandable. Example: I prefer root vegetables. To clarify, I don’t like leafy greens or nightshades. Use in: Formal speech and writing."
    },
    {
      "title": "To cite an example…",
      "content": "To cite an example… “To cite an example” is another more formal twist of “For example,” with “cite” meaning “to quote as evidence.” So, that’s exactly when you should use this phrase: while quoting a factual source to support your point. Example: US workers deserve more vacation time. To cite an example, France and Spain allow up to 36 vacation days. Use in: Formal situations."
    },
    {
      "title": "To elucidate…",
      "content": "To elucidate… “Elucidate” is another synonym for “clarify.” It means “to make something clear” or “to explain.” So, when you elucidate , offer an example that helps further explain your point. Example: I believe a shift in strategy is necessary. To elucidate, here is a drafted strategy proposal. Use in: Formal situations."
    },
    {
      "title": "To give you an idea…",
      "content": "To give you an idea… “To give you an idea” signals readers (or listeners) that you’re giving them something to imagine or visualize that will support your point. In this case, the “ideas” you’re sharing are examples that validate what you’re saying. [12] X Research source Example: We want to implement these changes company-wide. To give you an idea of the effects, we had a small team using updated guidelines for the past month. Use in: Informal writing (primarily), although you can sometimes use it formally as well."
    },
    {
      "title": "To highlight…",
      "content": "To highlight… “Highlight” implies you’re drawing special attention to a specific example. Use it when you have an example that you feel is especially important, and you want to emphasize it. Example: To highlight my point, I’ve included several studies and their findings. Use in: Formal or informal situations."
    },
    {
      "title": "To illustrate…",
      "content": "To illustrate… This is another alternative you can use when you have a point to prove! After making your point, say “to illustrate” as an introduction before elaborating on a specific example. [13] X Research source Example: Public opinion is in favor of this issue. To illustrate, we surveyed 100 individuals, and here’s their feedback. Use in: Formal writing and speech. Alternatively, you could use the phrase “As illustrated…” or “Illustratively” in your writing. They work pretty much the same."
    },
    {
      "title": "To show you what I mean…",
      "content": "To show you what I mean… “To show you what I mean” works best when you use it with some sort of evidence (like research, a study, or an article) or even visual content (like a video or interview) that validates your point. Example: To show you what I mean by this, here are a series of articles published over the last year. Use in: Informal situations. Typically, phrases where you say “I” and speak from a personal perspective are more informal. Alternatively, you could use a more formal version: “To elucidate.” It’s basically a fancier way to say “clarify” or “explain.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "To put it another way…",
      "content": "To put it another way… While this isn’t exactly the same as saying “For example,” you can use the phrase when you want to clarify something with a more in-depth example that helps people understand you better. An alternative way to say this is: “In other words…” Example: I think we should implement more customer service strategies. To put it another way, we could respond to inquiries faster and have self-service support. Use in: Primarily informal situations."
    },
    {
      "title": "e.g.",
      "content": "e.g. The abbreviation “e.g.” is a shortened form of the Latin phrase “exempli gratia,” translating to “for the sake of the example.” So, it’s just a quicker, abbreviated way to say “for example” in writing! It should always be lowercase, separated by commas or parentheses. [14] X Research source Example: There are over 200 streaming services you can subscribe to (e.g., Netflix, Disney+, Spotify, and Amazon Prime). Use in: Formal writing."
    },
    {
      "title": "i.e.",
      "content": "i.e. This abbreviation is the short form of “id est,” which translates to “that is” in English. Use “i.e.” to define something for people or clarify what you just said. [15] X Research source Example: Fruit (i.e., strawberries, oranges, kiwi, and guava) is rich in vitamin C. Use in: Formal writing, including academic presentations and legal documents."
