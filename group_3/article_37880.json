If you can run a longer distance than 1 mile successfully, you’ll train your body to keep going and not give up once you start to get tired.

Running hills helps strengthen your leg muscles and train your endurance for a faster mile.

      "content": "Avoid doing too much too soon. While it’s great to be motivated and want to improve your mile time right away, working out too much too quickly can lead to injury. Shave off your mile time gradually, and be patient with yourself as you work toward your goals. [6] X Research source Be sure to incorporate 1 to 2 rest days into your weekly routine. Rest days give your muscles a chance to recover, which actually makes them stronger over time. Some runners see results in a few weeks, but some have to wait months until they see any change. Rest assured that you can reach your goal if you give yourself enough time."

If you are slouched or flat-footed, that could be the reason why your mile time isn’t improving. Keep your shoulders back and stare straight ahead, and run with your head held high. [7] X Expert Source Kai Ng Certified Running Coach Expert Interview. 12 February 2021. Look at the horizon, not at your feet. Tilting your head at this angle will align and straighten your neck and back. Keep your shoulders level and loose. If they start to come up toward your ears, then stop running and shake them out or stretch them gently. Place your arms at a 90-degree angle and allow them to go forward and backward instead of across your body. Keep your fists unclenched with your finger lightly touching your palms."

Whenever you set out to run a mile, keep a stopwatch going to see how fast you can make it. Note your average mile time and then aim for a faster mile from there.
