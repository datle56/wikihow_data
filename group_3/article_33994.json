      "content": "You shouldn’t let anyone pressure you into having sex. There isn’t a “right” time or age when you should have sex or lose your virginity, so it all depends on when you feel comfortable making that choice. Your first time is really personal and everyone experiences it at a different time, so don’t let your partner or your friends make you feel like you need to rush into something you’re not ready for.

      "content": "Communicate openly so you know what your partner is comfortable with. Try to have a discussion before you even get intimate to make sure you’re both ready. Talk about what you expect from sex, what feels good for you, and if it’s something you want to do together. If your partner has had sex before, be sure to talk about their past partners and ask if they’ve been tested for sexually-transmitted infections (STIs) to ensure you stay safe . [2] X Research source For example, you might ask something like, “What would you like to do when we’re feeling in the mood?” or “What can I do to make you feel the best when we have sex?” If your partner avoids the subject, they might not be ready or comfortable with having sex yet. It's always important to respect boundaries! [3] X Expert Source Lisa Shield Dating Coach Expert Interview. 13 December 2018."

      "content": "Condoms can help prevent unwanted pregnancies and STIs. Choose condoms that are made of latex or polyurethane and have reservoir tips for the best protection. When you open the condom, pinch the tip with one hand and put it on your penis. Then, roll the condom down the entire length so it fits tightly. [11] X Research source While condoms are some of the most effective forms of birth control, they don’t offer 100% protection, so you may want to ask if your partner is on another form of contraceptive.
