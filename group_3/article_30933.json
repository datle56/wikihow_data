      "content": "Wait for the perfect time to drop your line. Timing is everything when it comes to delivering pickup lines, so feel the flow of the conversation before making your move. If you’re gaming together, try dropping a line in the middle of an adventure, like when you’re building together or exploring caves. If you’re talking about the game in person, wait for a lighthearted moment when the vibes feel fun and flirty. Jacoby says, “being friendly is all it takes” and you don’t have to be “super smooth or rehearsed.” The more spontaneous and goofier, the better!"

      "content": "Personalize your joke to show off your humor. When you’re starting to flirt with someone , it’s great to have a bunch of pickup lines in your back pocket, but coming up with a unique line will level up your game. Think of different, well-known elements of Minecraft, such as mobs, items, or building blocks, then tie them into love or attraction. If you’re in the middle of a gaming sesh, try to weave your line into what’s happening on screen for extra points. If you’re near a torch, for example, you could say, “Are you a torch? Because you light up my world!” If you’re flirting online Bilotta says “emojis can be a great way to add a playful tone to your messages and convey your sense of humor.” Send a 😉, 😈, or 😏 to lighten the mood and be extra flirty!"

      "content": "Don’t overthink things and have fun delivering your line. Confidence is one of the biggest factors when it comes to flirting with someone, and if you don’t look or sound comfortable delivering your pickup line, it’ll show. Be sure to look at the other person directly and flash a smile if you’re delivering your line in person. Or, deliver your line with a playful or cheeky tone if you’re gaming or texting. If your pickup line falls flat, don’t try to explain it. Instead, make a joke about the line! For example, you could tell them it was terrible but that they were making you nervous. Bilotta says, “one of the best ways to put someone at ease and build a connection is to be willing to laugh at yourself.”"
