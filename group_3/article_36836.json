      "title": "Start with the exterior if you have to choose.",
      "content": "Start with the exterior if you have to choose. If you’re faced with the choice of whether to start on the interior or the exterior of your home, go with the exterior. Make any necessary roof repairs and spruce up your siding if it needs it. Don’t start renovating the inside of your home until the outside is in tip-top shape. [1] X Research source You wouldn’t want to have a brand new kitchen and flooring if you have a leaky roof, for example. If the exterior of your home looks great, then skip right to renovating the interior!"

      "title": "Prioritize the rooms you use the most.",
      "content": "Prioritize the rooms you use the most. Break up your home renovations into pieces so you can live in your home and keep costs down as you make renovations. Focus on the rooms and areas that you use the most and do them one at a time. When you’re finished with one room or area, move on to another! For instance, if you like to spend a lot of time in your living room but you don’t really cook too often, start your renovations with your living room and save your kitchen for later."

      "title": "Save the floors for last.",
      "content": "Save the floors for last. Renovations can take time and be a messy process, especially when you have contractors working in parts of your home. Do your floors last so they’re less likely to be damaged or get walked on while they’re setting. [2] X Research source Try to wait until you’re finished with any other major remodeling projects before you start on floors. However, because floors are usually expensive and take a lot of time, if it suits your needs and plans to get them out of the way first, then go for it!"

      "title": "Research home renovation costs to see what you can afford to do.",
      "content": "Research home renovation costs to see what you can afford to do. Look up the cost of the materials you’d like to use for your renovations such as flooring, siding, appliances, and countertops. Work out the costs for each room, including structural work and finishing touches like paint. Get quotes from contractors and put together a budget for your project. [3] X Research source Check for any building restrictions before you start renovations. Some locations may have rules and prohibited renovations.

    {
      "title": "Put together a detailed project plan for your renovations.",
      "content": "Put together a detailed project plan for your renovations. Work with a contractor and designer to create blueprints and a plan for your renovations. Come up with a list of things you need and a list of things that you want, which can help make future budgeting decisions easier. Decide on a plan of which projects you want to start first. [4] X Research source For instance, your “need” list could include new countertops and a new stove, while your “want” list could include new bathroom fixtures and backsplash. Your contractor can help you come up with an effective gameplan for your project."

      "title": "Start with what needs the most work.",
      "content": "Start with what needs the most work. Avoid making renovations as soon as you move into a new home. Instead, live in your home for at least a few months so you can better understand what works, what doesn’t, and what needs to work better. If you’ve already been living in your home for a long time, start your renovations with what needs the most work. [5] X Research source For instance, if your bathrooms are outdated but functional and your kitchen really needs new, working appliances, start with your kitchen first. Living in your home is the best way to learn what needs to be fixed first."

      "content": "Check to see if your homeowner’s insurance covers any renovations. Some policies may include coverage for some renovations, which can really help you out as you budget.

      "content": "Pad your budget by at least 10-15% to cover overages. The truth is, almost all home renovations will go over budget and take a little longer than expected. But if you prepare for it, you won’t be as frustrated if and when it happens. Add a little extra budgetary cushion by tacking on an additional 10-15% of your total budget. [10] X Research source So for instance, if you have a total budget of $30,000 USD, take 15% of that, which is $4,500, and add it together for a total budget (including padding) of $34,500 USD."

      "content": "Focus on increasing efficiency instead of size. Find ways you can further utilize and reorganize your spaces so they have more utility and function. Instead of renovating your entire kitchen space and knocking down or adding walls, try replacing shelves that take up space with pullout drawers that contain racks for canned goods, for example. [16] X Research source For instance, you could also add a sleeping loft to a small room or install more storage racks and shelves in a closet to increase efficiency. The more usable space and appliances you can fit into a room, the more value it has."
