      "content": "Drink plenty of water. Low blood pressure can accompany dehydration, so you may be able to raise your blood pressure by increasing your water intake.

      "title": "Eat smaller meals more frequently.",
      "content": "Eat smaller meals more frequently. Eating several small meals, rather than one or two large meals, can help regulate your blood sugar and blood pressure. Aim to make these meals healthy and low in carbohydrates. When you do eat carbohydrates, avoid processed carbs such as pasta and white bread. Go for complex carbs instead, such as oatmeal, whole grain pasta, whole grain bread, and barley. Low blood pressure after a meal, which is called postprandial hypotension, is common in adults over the age of 65. You may experience low blood pressure 1-2 hours after a meal."

      "content": "Balance your diet. An important way to regulate your blood pressure and improve your overall health is to eat a healthy, well-balanced diet. A balanced diet includes lean meats and fish, whole grains, and a lot of fruits and vegetables. Avoid heavily processed foods that are high in sugar and fat. While these do often contain higher levels of sodium, they are not a healthy source of other nutrients. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Increase your Vitamin B12 and folate consumption. These vitamins contribute to a healthy blood pressure function and circulation. [5] X Research source Fortified cereal contains both minerals. Some other sources of B12 include fish and dairy products such a cheese, milk, and yogurt.

      "content": "Drink caffeine. Caffeine constricts blood vessels, which can increase blood pressure. Increasing your caffeine intake by a moderate amount can help raise your blood pressure. [7] X Research source Be careful that you don't consume too much caffeine. Since it's a diuretic, caffeine may increase your fluid loss through urination, which can cause dehydration. This may in turn cause orthostatic hypotension, which is low blood pressure due to dehydration."

      "content": "Try taking herbal remedies. Herbal remedies are not proven to help blood pressure, but there is anecdotal evidence that some herbs may lessen the effects of low blood pressure. Some of these include aniseed and rosemary. [8] X Research source Adding these to your diet may offer some benefits, but you should ask your doctor before taking any herbal supplements. Cooking with these herbs is unlikely to have measurable effects, however. Ginger may actually lower blood pressure, so do not use ginger supplements if you already have low blood pressure. Cinnamon may also lower your blood pressure. Do not use cinnamon supplements if you have low blood pressure. [9] X Research source Pepper may also lower blood pressure.
