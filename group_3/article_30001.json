The road should be empty enough that you have time to make a turn without a car running into you. [1] X Research source Never perform three-point turns during emergencies or on busy roads. The turn is too complex to do in cramped, stressful situations."

      "content": "Pick a point in the road where drivers can clearly see you from a distance. Three-point turns take time, and you'll want to find a spot where other drivers can recognize what your car is doing. Avoid, for example, making a three-point turn near a bend or the brow of a hill, as it can block you from the view of other drivers. If you're near an obstruction when you want to make a three-point turn, wait until you pass it before starting the maneuver. The middle of a wide, empty road or cul-de-sac are both ideal spots for making three-point turns."

Usually, a two-way road is enough room to make a three-point turn. If you have enough space, try doing a U-turn instead. U-turns are easier to perform and often safer than three-point turns.

Tap your breaks to alert anyone behind you that you're making a turn. Completing a three-point turn should take at least 15-20 seconds.

Take as many points as you need, as long as the road is clear. If it's not, drive ahead and find a better place to turn around or complete the turn faster."
