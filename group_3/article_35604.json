      "title": "Go to the emergency room if you have severe pain.",
      "content": "Go to the emergency room if you have severe pain. If you have sudden, severe pain in your abdomen, you should visit the emergency room. Your appendix may have ruptured, which requires medical attention. [1] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Specifically, pay attention to pain in your lower right abdomen or pain that starts at your navel and moves to your lower abdomen. It generally gets worse if you move or cough. You may notice other symptoms, too, such as nausea, vomiting, fever, bloating, diarrhea, constipation, or loss of appetite. Don't ignore the pain in your abdomen, even if you don't think it's severe enough to be appendicitis. It's better to get checked out by a medical professional just in case."

      "title": "Expect tests when you visit the doctor.",
      "content": "Expect tests when you visit the doctor. If you're just having intermittent abdominal pain, you should still see the doctor. The most common test is an abdominal ultrasound to look for an inflamed appendix. You may also have blood tests, urine tests, a pelvic exam, and a rectal exam, depending on what your doctor suspects the problem is."

      "title": "Learn the diagnosis.",
      "content": "Learn the diagnosis. If it is appendicitis, your doctor may take a wait and see approach, as long as your appendicitis hasn't burst or it isn't too inflamed. If you prefer this approach, talk it over with your doctor."

      "title": "Discuss antibiotics with your doctor.",
      "content": "Discuss antibiotics with your doctor. In some cases, doctors are reaching for antibiotics to treat an inflamed appendix. About 3/4 of the time, the patient doesn't need to have their appendix out. The antibiotics help treat the inflammation and relieve the pain.

      "content": "Skip taking pain medications unless prescribed by a doctor. While you want to get rid of the pain, if you take pain medications, you may not be able to tell if the pain gets worse. If your appendix bursts, you need to return to the doctor, and you need to know when that happens, which is what the pain will tell you."

      "title": "Ask what medications you can take.",
      "content": "Ask what medications you can take. If you are sent home from the hospital, ask what it's appropriate to take. Your doctor may give you a prescription for pain medications if they think you aren't close to rupturing, in which case you can take the medication to relieve pain.

      "title": "Discuss surgery to stop the pain.",
      "content": "Discuss surgery to stop the pain. In the past, surgery was always the first course of action with appendicitis.

      "title": "Ask if you have an abscess.",
      "content": "Ask if you have an abscess. In some cases, if your appendix has ruptured, you may have developed an abscess. If that's the case, your doctor may need to drain it before you have surgery. In fact, you may need to wait a week or 2 to have surgery.

      "title": "Expect them to start with laparoscopic surgery.",
      "content": "Expect them to start with laparoscopic surgery. Laparoscopic surgery is less invasive than traditional surgery. With this procedure, the doctor uses 1 to 3 small cuts in your abdomen, and then fills your abdomen with carbon dioxide so they can see. They take the appendix out through the small slits."

      "content": "Know you may need an open appendectomy. Sometimes, you may not be able to have laparoscopic surgery. In that case, you'll need an open appendectomy, where the doctor makes an incision about 4 inches (10 cm) long. [6] X Trustworthy Source Johns Hopkins Medicine Official resource database of the world-leading Johns Hopkins Hospital Go to source For instance, if your appendix has burst and the infection has spread, you may need an open appendectomy instead of a laparoscopic surgery.

Focus on each sensation in turn.
