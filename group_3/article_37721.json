Whether your Roku isn't responding at all or there seems to be a delay, dead or dying batteries could be the culprit. Open the battery compartment, remove the current batteries, and replace them with a brand new pair. [1] X Research source TV mounting service expert Jocotra Cathey agrees—the first troubleshooting step for any remote control problem should be to check the batteries. Make sure they're inserted properly and securely in place. When removing the batteries, Cathey recommends looking for evidence of corrosion near the connectors. If you have a rechargeable voice remote, connect it to the USB-C or micro-USB charging cable, and connect the other end to a power source. For a Roku Voice Remote Pro, allow 3 hours to charge. For a 2nd edition Voice Pro Remote, allow it to charge it for 5.5 hours."
