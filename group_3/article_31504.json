      "content": "A \"low oil pressure stop engine\" light is an early alert for engine-related problems. An illuminated red oil pressure light appears as an old-school oil can with a drop of oil coming out of its spout. Generally, this alerts you that your oil may need to be topped off. However, in extreme cases, it can signal an oil leak in the engine, a blown piston ring, or a broken oil pump. [1] X Research source Low oil pressure warning light differs from an oil change reminder light, which, depending on your vehicle, may appear as a yellow oil pressure light. You may also see a “Maintenance Required,” “Service Required,” or “Oil Change” light on your dashboard. [2] X Research source In some vehicles, a continuously low oil pressure light means to top the engine oil as soon as possible. At the same time, an oil pressure low stop engine light that comes on and off may indicate a faulty sensor. [3] X Research source Some vehicles have a red stop engine lamp warning light that indicates the engine must be stopped as soon as possible. If it flashes, that tells the driver they have 30 seconds to pull over before the car automatically shuts down. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Insufficient oil levels",
      "content": "Insufficient oil levels A common cause of low oil pressure is insufficient oil in the vehicle. If you’ve recently changed your oil and find it low again, you may be dealing with oil or seal leaks. Symptoms: You’ve hit the 3,000-mile mark or 6 months have passed since your last oil change. The vehicle will have a decrease in performance and may produce a burning oil scent if left unaddressed. The Fix: Check your oil level . Remove the oil dipstick, wipe it off, then replace it and pull it back out. Inspect the end of the dipstick and see if the oil is between the maximum and minimum fill lines. If the level is low, add more engine oil using a funnel until it reaches the max line. [5] X Research source Cost of Repair: A quart of engine oil ranges from $4 to $20. Engines require four to eight quarts of oil. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Incorrect oil viscosity",
      "content": "Incorrect oil viscosity Oil viscosity refers to the fluid's flow resistance. Generally, you want to use lower-viscosity oils during colder months and higher-viscosity oils during the summer for optimal performance. If your oil viscosity is wrong, it can trigger the low oil pressure warning light. [7] X Research source Symptoms: Look for a decrease in engine performance, an overheating engine, and reduced fuel economy. If this is an issue, your oil pressure or check engine light will appear. [8] X Research source The Fix: In the case of high oil pressure, Helvy recommends draining the vehicle of the higher viscosity oil and replacing it with the correct type. Cost of Repair: A quart of engine oil ranges from $4 to $20. Engines require four to eight quarts of oil. [9] X Research source"

      "title": "Infrequent oil changes",
      "content": "Infrequent oil changes Mechanics recommend changing your oil every 3,000 miles or 6 months. Dey notes that moisture can affect the oil, especially if the car is left sitting. Because metal is temperature sensitive, the moisture in the air condenses inside of it, causing the oil to degrade over time. When you leave old oil in your vehicle, it can create a sludge that blocks oil flow. [10] X Research source Similarly, when an engine is old, it’ll burn more oil, requiring more frequent oil changes than a new vehicle with a modern engine. [11] X Research source Symptoms: An overdue oil change will cause the engine to overheat, leading to the check engine light appearing. You may also notice a burning smell or smoke from the exhaust. The Fix: Check your oil level . If the level is low, add more engine oil using a funnel until it's just below the maximum fill line. [12] X Research source Cost of Repair: A quart of engine oil ranges from $4 to $20. Engines require four to eight quarts of oil. [13] X Research source"

      "title": "Clogged oil filter",
      "content": "Clogged oil filter Oil filters remove dirt and other debris from the engine oil. Naturally, the oil filter begins to clog up, which prevents perfectly good oil from flowing around the engine. This causes the oil pressure to drop, thus triggering the yellow or red light on your dashboard. Symptoms: A clogged oil filter will cause the low oil pressure or check engine light to illuminate. You’ll also notice your oil is dark or thick, the exhaust fumes are dirty, and the filter may leak. [14] X Research source The Fix: To change the oil filter , first loosen the oil fill cap to drain into an oil drain pan. Once the tank has been emptied, find the oil filter by looking for a metal cylinder attached to the engine block. Screw it off by hand or with a wrench and replace it with a new oil filter. Afterward, replace the engine oil with your vehicle’s recommended oil type and a funnel. Cost of Repair: A DIY replacement can cost anywhere from $25 to $70 when synthetic oil is used. A professional service can cost between $65 to $125. [15] X Research source Dey highly recommends staying on top of your manufacturer’s maintenance requirements. “Give [your] car a consistent deity of fluids. [Using] the same brand and type of oil, brake fluid, transmission fluids, and coolant [ensures] your vehicle will last a really long time.”"

      "content": "Faulty oil pump or oil pressure sensor While some vehicles have a flashing oil pressure light to indicate a faulty sensor, with others, you may need to test the oil pump manually to determine if it’s faulty or not. You can also check for signs of wear and metal shavings in the oil. [16] X Research source Symptoms: A major sign of a faulty pump or sensor is the illumination of the low oil pressure light, an overheating engine, and excessive knocking sounds. The Fix: Replacing an oil pump is a complex task. See a mechanic for diagnosis and repairs if you suspect this is the problem. Cost of Repair: For a professional mechanic to replace your oil pump, expect to pay about $1,200-1,400. [17] X Research source"

      "title": "Engine wear",
      "content": "Engine wear If your engine has high mileage, low oil pressure may be caused by an issue with the engine bearings. Worn bearings reduce flow restriction and lower the oil pressure. [18] X Research source Symptoms: In addition to low oil pressure, you may also hear a knocking noise in the engine. [19] X Research source The Fix: Helvy notes that replacing bearings is not an easy fix and should be left to an experienced mechanic. Cost of Repair: On average, an engine rebuild can run between $2,500 to $4,000. [20] X Research source"

Running out of oil can cause serious engine damage by causing it to seize up and refuse to turn over. The car can even abruptly stop while driving, putting you and others at risk of an accident. Call a local mechanic or towing company immediately for assistance. [21] X Research source"

      "content": "Normal oil pressure while driving runs between 25-65 PSI. A vehicle’s oil pressure will vary depending on the make and model. However, a range of 25 to 65 pounds per square inch (PSI) is generally acceptable for most vehicles. Refer to your car’s dashboard and look for a gauge between 0 and 8 or 0 and 80 to read the pressure PSI. It’s often located next to an oil icon. [22] X Research source You can also use your owner’s manual to determine the appropriate range for your vehicle."

      "content": "Change your oil every 3,000 to 5,000 miles. The frequency of oil changes may vary depending on the type of oil you use and the age of your engine. For instance, if your vehicle requires full-synthetic motor oil, it can go as far as 15,000 miles between services. Regular changes can improve your engine’s performance and prolong its lifespan.

      "content": "Use the correct oil type for your vehicle. Even if you change your oil regularly, using the wrong oil can cause damage. Check the engine cap or owner's manual to figure out which kind of oil your vehicle needs. A common grade of engine oil is 5W-30. The first number, 5W, indicates how well it pours in the winter. The lower the number, the better it performs. The second number, 30, indicates the oil’s weight at normal temperature. The higher the number, the thicker it is. [24] X Research source Look for your vehicle’s grade on your engine oil cap or in the owner’s manual."
