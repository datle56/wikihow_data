It may be easiest to find one specifically designed for use in your state. Many states provide power of attorney forms online. You can also find forms via websites such as USLegalForms.com. Often, a power of attorney is specific for the situation. For example, a financial power of attorney allows the agent to make decisions regarding the principal's finances, but does not necessarily grant power to the agent concerning health care decisions. A general power of attorney is less specific and allows the agent to make all decisions on behalf of the principal."

The document should use the full legal name of the principal. It must identify the agent (the person who is granted specified powers). The document should include the full name of the agent. The form should stipulate exactly what authority the principal is handing over to the agent. For example, the principal could hand over only financial authority to the agent (the power to control the principal's bank accounts) or health care decision making authority (so the agent could make health care decisions on behalf of the principal). The document should be clearly titled “Power of Attorney.” It should include the date at which the power will go into effect or the circumstances (such as the incapacitation of the principal) that will cause it to be enacted."

      "content": "Consider hiring a lawyer to review the document before you get it notarized. A lawyer can read the document and point out any errors or loopholes that need to be closed. For example, an attorney may notice that the document uses language that could been seen as ambiguous, and therefore could lead to confusion. An attorney can review the document at any time, but it will require notarization again if changes are necessary. You may be able to save time by having it examined before a final copy is notarized."

If either the agent or the principal have signed the document before meeting with the notary, another, unsigned copy of the document will need to be notarized. Make sure that both the agent and principal bring their identification (drivers license or another photo id) to show the notary. This will enable the notary to verify the identities of the parties."
