      "title": "Press the skill button right before an attack.",
      "content": "Press the skill button right before an attack. In order to do this, you must have a shield with the parry skill equipped in your left hand. Press the Skill button (usually L2/T2 on a controller) at the exact moment before an attack lands. This requires precise timing. If your timing is correct, you will stagger your opponent and leave them open to a guaranteed critical attack, or a Riposte. Different shields have different windows for when you can successfully parry. Generally speaking, smaller shields (such as a buckler) have the largest number or active frames when a parry can be successfully performed. Not all shields have the parry skill. Not all enemies, bosses, or attacks can be parried. Bosses may need to be parried a few times before they are staggered. A successful parry also leaves you invulnerable to attacks for a few frames after the attack. This can give you a window to escape a large group of enemies."
