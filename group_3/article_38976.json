If you haven't created your webpage yet, check out our guide to creating a simple website in HTML . If you prefer, you can also add your CSS code to a file that's separate from your HTML document. This involves creating a styles.css file for your CSS code, and linking it to your HTML document using the <link> tag. We'll focus this guide on adding the CSS directly to your HTML file, but check out How to Create CSS to learn how to create separate style sheets."

If the image is on the web and not in the same folder as your HTML file, you'll need to specify the path to the image. This can be the full URL to the image. For example, background-image: url(\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/my_background.png\"); . You can also use the path to the image on your web server. For example, if you are editing the HTML file www.wikihow.com/mypage.html and your background image is at www.wikihow.com/images/my_background.png, you can set your background using background-image: url(\"/images/my_background.png\"); ."

You can use CSS to change the size of your background in three ways: using the keywords cover or contain , by specifying a width value alone, or by specifying width and height values together. background-size: cover; Scales the background image to cover the entire container without stretching or shrinking the image. The container can be the entire web page or any other element. This is most common when setting a background image for an entire web page. background-size: contain; : This option scales the image to a smaller size to fit a container. [7] X Research source This option is useful if your background image is much larger than the container you're using it in. If the image is smaller, it will tile. background-size: background-size: 150px 200px; : This option makes the background image 150px wide and 200px tall. The first measurement is width, and the second is height. However, length is optional—if you only enter the width, the height will automatically scale without stretching or warping. You can also specify length and width in percentages."

You can specify two values for background-position—the first is always the horizontal value. If you don't specify a vertical value, the default will always be 50%. [8] X Research source Some examples: background-position: center; : Centers the background image. background-position: top; : Aligns to the top of the element. background-position: bottom; : Aligns to the bottom of the element. background-position: left; : Aligns to the left side of the element. background-position: right; : Aligns to the right side of the element. background-position: right top; : Aligns to the right side and the top of the element. background-position: center bottom; : Aligns to the center and the bottom of the element. background-position: top 20px right 10px; : Aligns to the top with a 20px offset, and the right with a 10px offset.
