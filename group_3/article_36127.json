      "content": "Strip the sheets and bedding off your bed and wash separately. To get blood stains out of your sheets , start by dabbing the stained area with a cold, wet washcloth. Next, fill your sink or bathtub with cold water, and let your sheets soak for at least 30 minutes. Remove your sheets and apply the stain fighter of your choice (such as hydrogen peroxide or OxiClean). Let the stain fighter sit for several hours, then machine wash your sheets with cold water.

      "content": "Once your mattress is bare, blot the stained area with a damp cloth. Wet a clean cloth with cold water, then wring it out until the cloth is just damp. Press the cloth into the blood stain and dab to lift as much of the stain as possible. Do not rub, as this can rub the stain deeper into the mattress fibers. Make sure to use cold water only, as hot water can set the stain and make it even harder to remove. [2] X Research source It’s also important to act as soon as you notice the blood stain. Fresh blood stains will be easier to remove (though it’s also possible to remove old ones)."

Dab (don’t rub!) the area repeatedly until the stain and the paste are completely gone. [5] X Research source Make sure to wet your cloth with cool water, not warm water.
