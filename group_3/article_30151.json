      "content": "Fold a pipe cleaner in half. Pipe cleaners are the easiest material to make a worry doll out of since they bend and twist. Grab a thin pipe cleaner and fold it in half so you have 2 equal sides. [2] X Research source You can choose whichever color you’d like, because most of the pipe cleaner will get covered up by yarn. If you’re making a worry doll with small children, they may not be able to twist the pipe cleaner on their own. Consider pre-forming the bodies of each doll and letting your child decorate it."

      "content": "Make a loop around your finger and twist it into place. Stick out your pointer finger on one hand and drape the folded pipe cleaner over it. Use your other hand to twist the pipe cleaner directly underneath your finger 2 times to hold the loop in place. [3] X Research source This loop creates the head of your doll."

      "title": "Bend 1 side of the pipe cleaner toward the loop, then twist it into place.",
      "content": "Bend 1 side of the pipe cleaner toward the loop, then twist it into place. Take 1 of the pieces of the pipe cleaner that’s hanging down and bend it about half way, keeping it parallel with the loop you just made. Twist the end of the pipe cleaner to keep it in place. [4] X Research source This first bend creates the first arm for your doll."

      "title": "Do the same thing to the other side to make the arms.",
      "content": "Do the same thing to the other side to make the arms. Try to bend the other side of the pipe cleaner at the same length you bent the other one so that the arms are even. You’ll be left with 2 arms sticking out and some excess pipe cleaner hanging down. [5] X Research source If the arms aren’t totally even, that’s okay. Try to make them similar so that your doll looks proportionate."

      "title": "Twist the excess pipe cleaner around itself 3 to 4 times.",
      "content": "Twist the excess pipe cleaner around itself 3 to 4 times. Pull the 2 sides of the pipe cleaner together underneath the arms and twist them around each other a few times to create the body. Leave the excess ends untwisted so your doll has 2 distinct legs. [6] X Research source Make sure the twists on the body are pretty tight so they don’t unravel as you’re decorating your doll. If the legs are too long, trim them with a pair of scissors."

      "title": "Tie 6 in (15 cm) lengths of yarn around the top to make hair.",
      "content": "Tie 6 in (15 cm) lengths of yarn around the top to make hair. Cut 10 to 12 strands of yarn or embroidery thread that are about 6 inches (15 cm) long. Tie each strand in a knot around the top of the loop, and let the excess flow down the back of the doll. [7] X Research source If the hair is too long, cut the excess off with sharp scissors. If you’re using a wooden peg instead of a pipe cleaner, tie a few strands of yarn or thread together and then glue them to the top of the wooden peg to make hair. For fluffier hair, cut a pom pom in half and glue each portion to the top of the doll. To make a head wrap instead of hair, cut a 1 in (2.5 cm) length of fabric and fold it into a triangle. Then, glue the triangle to the top of the doll’s head."

Cut out a strand that’s about 6 inches (15 cm) long, then hold 1 end in place at the bottom of the loop. Wrap the rest of the yarn or thread around the entire top loop to create the face of the doll. [8] X Research source If you’re working on a wooden peg, adding yarn or thread on the face is optional. You can keep the wooden part bare if you’d like to."

      "content": "Glue the end of the yarn in place. When you run out of yarn or thread, hold the end of the strand against the back of the head and use a dot of hot glue to keep it in place. Hold the strand down for about 30 seconds to make sure it dries. [9] X Research source If you’re making this craft with a small child, use the hot glue gun yourself and don’t let them touch the glue until it’s dry."

For pants, wrap down and up one leg, and then the other. To make a skirt, wrap the strand around both of the legs at the same time. Glue the end of the strand in place. [11] X Research source You can make a couple different dolls that are all wearing different items of clothing. To make a flowing skirt for your doll, cut out a 3 in (7.6 cm) circle of fabric and then poke a small hole in the center with scissors. Slide the skirt up over the doll’s legs until it rests just underneath the shirt. For a dress, cut a 5 in (13 cm) circle of fabric and poke a small hole in the center. Slide the skirt up to the doll’s arms and rest it just underneath the armpits."

Give them a smiling face so they can comfort you in your times of worry. [12] X Research source You can also use glitter glue or a fabric marker for a brighter, more colorful face. If you’re crafting with a small child, you may need to draw the face for them."
