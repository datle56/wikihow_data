      "content": "Identify the E string and G string sides of the bridge. A violin bridge is a small piece of wood on the body of the violin that raises and aligns the strings. The bottom usually has two “feet” that sit on top of the instrument, while the top is arched slightly. You'll notice one side of the arch is slightly higher than the other. The lower side is the E string side, and the taller side is the G string side. [1] X Research source When you put the bridge in place, check that the E string comes over the low side and the G string comes over the high side. When the violin's scroll is facing your body, the G string (lowest string) will be the string farthest to the left. The E string (highest string) is the string farthest to the right. [2] X Research source If your bridge was already on and just slipped out of place, it should be properly aligned with the E and G strings already. If the bridge is backward, the E and G strings may feel too high or close to the fingerboard to play comfortably. You’ll have to remove the bridge and reinsert it the right way."

      "title": "Loosen the strings just enough to move the bridge underneath them.",
      "content": "Loosen the strings just enough to move the bridge underneath them. To avoid snapping a string, loosen them slightly by turning the pegs in the peg box on the end of the violin. [3] X Research source The strings should be loose enough that you can easily pull them up and down a few millimeters. Tip: The bridge is held in place by string tension (no adhesive). Loosening the strings too much will cause the bridge to slip completely. Allowing the bridge to slip can also cause the soundpost to fall out of position. The soundpost is a thin cylinder of wood inside the violin that allows the violin to resonate. It’s held in place by pressure from the strings and bridge. If your soundpost falls, take your instrument to a luthier to reset it. [4] X Research source If you’re setting up a brand new violin without strings , put on the G and E strings before positioning the bridge so the tension can hold it in place."

      "content": "Center the bridge between the notches on the F-holes, perpendicular to the violin’s surface. The F-holes are two f -shaped holes found on either side of the bridge. Each F-hole has a small notch in the center that indicates where to place the bridge. When you reposition the bridge under the strings, make sure it's between the two F-holes and aligns with the notches roughly at the midway point of the F-holes. The bridge should stand at a 90-degree angle compared to the surface of the violin beneath it. Imagine you're drawing a line from one F-hole to the next, starting at the small horizontal line running through one F-hole and stretching out to meet the small horizontal line running through the other F-hole. This imaginary line should run through the violin bridge."

      "title": "Put the violin strings in the notches of the bridge.",
      "content": "Put the violin strings in the notches of the bridge. The violin bridge has four small notches running across the top. The four violin strings fit into these notches, keeping the bridge and the strings in place. Gently feed one violin string at a time into the notches on the bridge (if they slid out of place during your adjustment). The notch for the E-string may have a coating on it (called a parchment) to keep the very thin E-string from gradually digging into the wood. Alternatively, your E-string may have a plastic tube around the portion that sits on the bridge. This tubing should only be used if the bridge is missing a parchment. Tip: While the strings are still loose, rub the tip of a pencil on the bridge notches to coat them in graphite. This helps the strings slide more easily across the bridge. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Tighten the strings one by one to secure the bridge in place.",
      "content": "Tighten the strings one by one to secure the bridge in place. Gently turn each tuning peg on the scroll of the violin to tighten and tune your strings , and then adjust the fine tuners to help tune your strings to a more precise pitch. Use one hand to hold the bridge in place while tightening the strings to prevent it from falling over again. [6] X Research source As you cross over, tighten the strings until they are secure enough to keep the bridge in place while still having a very slight amount of slack. Once your strings are tightened, you’re ready to inspect your work and start playing !"

      "title": "Make sure the bridge is standing at a 90-degree angle.",
      "content": "Make sure the bridge is standing at a 90-degree angle. Once you've placed your bridge, you'll check to make sure its placement is correct before playing. Lay your violin down on a flat surface and get down to the violin's level. The side of the bridge facing the violin's tailpiece should stand at a 90-degree angle. The other side of the bridge should be sloped forward slightly toward the tailpiece. Another way to check is to look at the feet of the bridge. If they’re lifting slightly on one side, it’s a sign that your bridge is not at a perfect right angle."

    {
      "title": "Check to make sure the bridge is centered on the violin.",
      "content": "Check to make sure the bridge is centered on the violin. Your bridge should be in the exact center of the violin and not too far left or right. If your bridge is leaning to the right or the left, loosen your strings again slightly and gently push it until it's in the center of the violin. The outer edges of the bridge should roughly align with the most inward point of the F-holes. See if the bridge is in the center by glancing at the violin from above. To be extra sure, use a ruler or measuring tape to measure the length of each end of the bridge to the end of the violin. The measurements should be as close to equal as possible. Another way to check is to look at how the E and G-strings are sitting on the fingerboard. If these strings are both the same distance away from the outer edges of the fingerboard, then your bridge is in the right spot."

      "title": "Make sure the bridge lines up with the notches in the F-holes.",
      "content": "Make sure the bridge lines up with the notches in the F-holes. The bridge should be between the F-holes, aligned with the middle of each hole. The bridge may have slipped slightly while you were tightening the strings, so once again check. Make sure you can draw an imaginary line through the center of each F-hole that runs through the bridge. If the bridge has moved, loosen your strings slightly and gently use your fingers to make the necessary adjustment."

      "title": "Play the violin to test the action of the strings.",
      "content": "Play the violin to test the action of the strings. Once you’ve double-checked the bridge’s position and tightened (and tuned) your strings, play a few scales or measures from your favorite piece and notice the string action and sound. Do the strings feel higher or lower on the fingerboard than usual? Are you accidentally playing more than one string at a time? Is the sound less full? If anything feels or sounds off, recheck your bridge’s position. [7] X Research source If the bridge was placed backward, then the G-string will feel low and make a buzzing or rattling sound against the fingerboard. The E-string will feel high and hard to play. If all the strings feel too high or low, the bridge may be above or below the notches on the F-holes. Or, it may be slanting one way or the other, affecting the strings’ height and tension. The arch of the bridge separates the strings and makes it easier to play one string at a time. If the arch is off, you may hit multiple strings at once when you didn’t mean to."

      "title": "Hold the bridge when tuning if it often slides out of place.",
      "content": "Hold the bridge when tuning if it often slides out of place. Bridges often fall out of place during tuning since you’re loosening and adjusting your strings. To prevent this from happening, hold your bridge in place with one hand when tuning. If your bridge slips frequently when tuning, it’s probably warped or needs to be refitted to your instrument."

      "content": "Replace strings individually. On occasion, you will need to replace the strings of your violin as they break and wear down over time. In this case, replace strings one at a time. Removing more than one string at once can cause the bridge to fall out of place due to the lack of tension. [8] X Research source"

Take your violin to an instrument shop or luthier’s workshop, preferably the one where you bought your violin. A professional there will also sand it, if necessary, and make sure it's the right size and shape for your violin. Your violin teacher or orchestra director might also be able to do the same. Having your bridge refitted or repositioned by a pro costs around $25. [9] X Research source"

      "content": "Replace your bridge when it’s warped or the string notches are worn deep. Over time, the strings might wear down the notches on the top of the bridge, and the side nearest the fingerboard may warp or change shape. When this happens, the sound and response of your violin will suffer, so it’s time to order a new bridge and have it professionally fitted. [10] X Research source"

      "content": "Have a luthier or your teacher fit a brand-new bridge to your violin. New or “blank” bridges aren’t ready for playing right away. The feet may need to be sanded to be perfectly flush with your violin, and the arched top may need to be sanded down to adjust the string height. It’s best to let a professional fit the bridge for you until you’re confident in your abilities to do it yourself. [11] X Research source Buy a bridge that matches the size of your violin. If you’re on a full-sized instrument (4/4), for example, you’d need a matching full-sized bridge. Smaller instruments for students require smaller bridges."
