      "title": "Painite was declared the world’s rarest gemstone in 2005.",
      "content": "Painite was declared the world’s rarest gemstone in 2005. It holds the Guinness World Record for the rarest gemstone (though others are of a similar rarity, like musgravite). In fact, after Painite was discovered in 1951, there remained only 2 known specimens for decades, and presently, there are less than 1,000 known gemstones altogether (many of them not faceted). While it’s primarily known for its rarity, it also has dazzling hues similar to a ruby. [1] X Research source Color : Red, pink, brown, and orange-red Luster and transparency : Glassy and transparent to translucent Hardness on the Mohs scale : 7.5 - 8.0 Chemical composition : Calcium, zirconium, aluminum, boron, and oxygen (CaZrAl₉O₁₅(BO₃)) Average price per karat : $60,000+"

      "title": "Red Beryl minerals are rarely found in gem quality.",
      "content": "Red Beryl minerals are rarely found in gem quality. They’re valuable because over 95% of the minerals found each year are lower-quality—so only about 1 out of every 150,000 are actually gem-quality. Red beryl gems are in the same family as emerald, aquamarine, and morganite; however, red beryl gems contain manganese, which gives it the rich red color that it’s known for. [2] X Research source Color : Reddish-pink to deep red Luster and transparency : Glassy and transparent to translucent Hardness on the Mohs scale : 7.5 - 8.0 Chemical composition : Beryllium, aluminum, and silica (Be₃Al₂Si₆O₁₈,) Average price per karat : $10,000"

      "content": "Alexandrite is known for changing color in different levels of light. In fact, it’s often called an “emerald by day, ruby by night,” referring to its blue-green color in full daylight and red-purple color in low light. Alexandrite was discovered in 1830 in the Ural mountains of Russia and named after Czar Alexander II, though it’s now mainly found in Brazil, Sri Lanka, and East Africa. [3] X Research source Color : Green in daylight and red in incandescent light Luster and transparency : Glassy, shimmering, and transparent to translucent Hardness on the Mohs scale : 8.5 Chemical composition : Chrysoberyl (BeAl₂O₄) Average price per karat : $15,000 to $70,000"

      "content": "Black opal is so rare that it’s only found in Australia. Opals come in various colors, with the most common being cream-white, gray, and green (along with the opal’s characteristic rainbow of color inside because of the diffraction of light). Black opals are the rarest and, therefore, most valuable; its dark coloring and vibrant opalescent gleam resemble the aurora borealis! [4] X Research source Color : Dark gray to jet black with a rainbow shine Luster and transparency : Glassy to resinous Hardness on the Mohs scale : 5.5 - 6.5 Chemical composition : Hydrated silica (SiO2·nH2O) Average price per karat : $15,000 (with one of the most valuable selling for $763,000)"

      "content": "Tanzanite can only be gathered from one mine in the world. It’s remarkable for its exceptional trichroism (meaning it shows 3 colors when viewed at different angles). Tanzanite’s colors are blue, violet, and burgundy—although its real value comes from its rarity. Discovered in 1967 in Tanzania, Africa, the gemstone is currently gathered from a single mine there and will likely be mined out in 30 years or so.

      "content": "Benitoite is a deep blue gem only found in San Benito County, California. Discovered in the early 1900s, benitoite is rarer than diamonds and has a greater dispersion (referring to the optical phenomenon when light enters a gem and scatters into a rainbow of colors). Because gem-quality benitoite develops in a very specific location, it’s highly sought-after and quite valuable. [6] X Research source Color : Dark sapphire blue with some purple Luster and transparency : Glassy and transparent to translucent Hardness on the Mohs scale : 6.0 - 6.5 Chemical composition : Barium titanium cyclosilicate mineral (BaTiSi3O9) Average price per karat : $2,000 Fun fact—because of its origins, benitoite is the official state gem of California!"

      "content": "Jadeite is the most expensive and rare variety of jade. Although jadeite comes in a number of different colors, its most well-known (and prized) color is imperial jade. It has tons of folklore attached to it in Chinese and Mayan cultures, so the price tag of a jadeite gem typically varies based on its history and artistry in addition to its texture and appearance.

      "content": "Burma Rubies have a singular, vivid color and fine quality. While all ruby gems are rare, Burma rubies are especially scarce and among the highest-quality rubies available. That’s because the conditions in Myanmar cause rubies to form with less trace iron than most, which is why their color (nicknamed “pigeon blood”) and fluorescence are so notable compared to other ruby types. [8] X Research source Color : Deep, vivid red Luster and transparency : Subadamantine (high degrees of luster) and transparent or translucent Hardness on the Mohs scale : 9.0 Chemical composition : Aluminium oxide with chromium Average price per karat : $10,000 to $15,000"

These gems are also found in Mozambique and Nigeria, although they remain very scarce. They’re prized among tourmaline varieties for their neon-electric colors as well as their incredible rarity!

It originates from limited deposits in the Rocky Mountains, and the aragonite mollusk shells comprising it give the gemstone its lovely, iridescent colors.

      "content": "Natural pearls are extremely rare due to pollution and overfishing. Pearls may be super common—but natural ones surprisingly aren’t. Natural pearls are typically off-color and not perfectly round, unlike cultured pearls that are purposefully made for use in jewelry.

      "content": "Musgravite is another contender for the rarest gem in the world. The gem was discovered in 1967 in Musgrave Ranges, Australia, its namesake. Since then, it’s also been found in Madagascar and Greenland. However, it’s so rare and valuable that finding jewelry with musgravite is very hard to do, and it’s not readily available on the market in many cases.
