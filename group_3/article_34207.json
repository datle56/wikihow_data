Because Tor is associated with the Dark Web and hacking, your use of it may raise a red flag on some websites. [10] X Research source Tor is extremely slow and is for those who want to keep all their data completely anonymous. Tor can be downloaded from https://torproject.org/ . Tor does not work everywhere and is completely blocked in countries like China. Also, many websites block Tor exit nodes because of their high use for spam, so the sites you get to use are completely limited. If you don't want to go as far as browsing on Tor, switch to Firefox. Firefox is more secure than other browsers and has greater privacy options. The default browser that came with your computer is probably the weakest. If you use Chrome, you'll be tracked by Google. [11] X Research source The Brave browser, which was publicly released in November of 2019, is another open-source option that prioritizes the privacy and security of its users, in part by automatically blocking third-party ads, trackers, and autoplay videos.

For example, Edge has three tracking prevention modes: Basic, Balanced, and Strict. Strict blocks most third-party trackers from loading, but it may have an impact on website functionality. Safari has an option to disable cross-site tracking in Safari preferences. Chrome allows you to enable \"Do not track\" requests as well as block third-party cookies.

Many people enjoy naming their routers with a clever pun or other joke. Set a complicated password that includes letters, numbers, and other characters allowed by your router.

Entering all of those MAC addresses can be cumbersome, especially if your friends or family members frequently upgrade to new devices.

[17] X Research source Check the settings of your computer and router to make sure these firewalls are enabled and are functioning properly. Typically, you'll find the firewall settings among your computer's security settings.
