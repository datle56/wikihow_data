      "content": "Warm up your face. Warming up your face will prepare your facial muscles for action. Some of these muscles coordinate eye motion, so by warming them up, you'll stand a better chance of moving one eye. To warm up: Massage your entire face lightly with your hands, rubbing in small circles. Pay special attention to the area around your eyes. Take a big, wide yawn. Open your eyes and mouth, and raise your eyebrows as high as you can. Now squeeze these features together tightly."

      "content": "Warm up your eyes. Now that your face muscles are warmed up, you can do the same for your eyes. Roll your eyes around your eye sockets a few times. Face forward, hold your neck still, and look hard to the left. Switch to the right. Then, keeping your neck and face in the same position, look up and down. Crossing your eyes is another great eye warmup and is useful for training one eye to move at a time. If you've never mastered this skill, the tips in the next step should help. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Learn to cross your eyes , if necessary. Some of you may have crossed your eyes as part of your warmup, but don't worry if you haven't yet mastered this skill. With a little practice, you'll be a pro. Practice crossing your eyes by looking at the tip of your nose with both eyes. Slowly slide your gaze upwards to the bridge of your nose while looking inward. Hold a pen at arm's length directly in between both eyes. Focus on the pen and slowly draw it to your face until it is 2 – 4 inches (5.1 – 10.2 cm) away. At this distance, your eyes should cross. These techniques may use muscles that don't usually get much exercise, which can cause fatigue. When you get tired, take a break and try again. It may take you a little while, but you'll get it eventually! [2] X Research source"

If you have any doubts, ask the opinion of a friend or family member. If you don't have a mirror or another person available to help check your form, snap a selfie. Being able to cross your eyes can make learning to move one eye at a time easier."

While holding your inward facing eye completely still, move the outward eye inward until it's in the crossed position. [3] X Research source Give your moving eye a guide to follow. Hold your finger at arm's length off to the side and in front of your outward facing eye. Focus on the finger with that eye. Move your finger inward to the center of your nose, following it with your outward eye."

For example, your right pointer finger should be in front of your right eye. Without moving the opposite-side eye, focus on the finger with the same-side eye. Slowly move the finger off to the side, following it with the same-side eye. [5] X Research source It may help if you position the finger so only the same-side eye can see it. Try starting with your finger a little off to the side."
