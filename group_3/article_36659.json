      "content": "A toothed gripping tool like pliers or a wrench are best. The teeth can grab the nut better, even if it’s stripped or rounded. You’ll still have to use a strong grip to break the nut free. When you have the tool locked onto the nut, turn hard counterclockwise to get it free. Some toothed tools that can work include: [1] X Research source Pliers. Mole grips, or locking pliers. A pipe wrench or monkey wrench. Bolt-remover sockets, designed to work with stripped nuts and bolts."

      "title": "Yes, if you file the nut with a metal file first.",
      "content": "Yes, if you file the nut with a metal file first. It's common to only have smooth tools instead of toothed types. You’re not out of luck! Use a metal file and file all the sides and edges of the nut. This roughs up the edges and gives smooth tools a better grip. Then lock the tool around the nut tightly and turn counterclockwise. [2] X Research source Even if your tools are toothed, this is a good trick to get an even better grip."

      "title": "Yes, but be careful not to damage whatever the nut is attached to.",
      "content": "Yes, but be careful not to damage whatever the nut is attached to. This method isn’t pretty, but it works. First, press the chisel directly against the top edge of the nut. Hit it hard with the hammer to make an indent in the nut. Then press the chisel into the indent from the right side. Hit the back of the chisel to turn the nut counterclockwise until it loosens. [3] X Research source Make sure you’re hitting the nut from the right so it turns counterclockwise. If you hit it from the left, you’ll be tightening it. This is not a good method to use for lug nuts on cars or fragile pieces of equipment. It’s easy to miss with the hammer and hit the object."

      "title": "Sure, if you have a metal-cutting saw blade.",
      "content": "Sure, if you have a metal-cutting saw blade. A Dremel is the best tool to use in this case, since it’s small and maneuverable. Attach a metal-cutting blade and cut across the top of the nut twice to make an X. It should pop off, or loosen enough to unscrew with pliers. [4] X Research source Always wear goggles and gloves while you’re cutting the nut. The saw will make sparks and fragments that could get in your eyes. If the nut doesn’t come off completely after cutting, try hitting it with a hammer and chisel to break it off. This isn’t the best method if you’re worried about damaging whatever the nut is attached to. Use a gentler method if that’s the case."

      "title": "Yes, this can help break the bonds holding the nut in place.",
      "content": "Yes, this can help break the bonds holding the nut in place. If you have a torch or heat induction tool, hold it against the nut to heat it up and loosen the bond. Then try to twist the nut off with pliers or a wrench. [5] X Research source Wear thick gloves and goggles whenever you’re working with heat. Make sure you don’t directly touch the nut or you could get a serious burn. Don’t use this method on a lug nut. High heat could damage the tires."

      "title": "Spraying the nut with penetrating oil could help loosen it a bit.",
      "content": "Spraying the nut with penetrating oil could help loosen it a bit. A product like WD-40 could work. Soak the nut with the penetrating oil and let it sit for a few minutes—or even overnight if you think the bolt might be rusted or corroded. Then try to twist the nut off with pliers or a wrench. [6] X Expert Source Barry Zakar Handyman Expert Interview. 20 August 2020. You could also file the sides of the nut before spraying the oil to give your pliers or wrench some extra grip."

      "content": "Use a bolt extractor so you don’t damage your rims. Getting stripped lug nuts off of a car is a bit more tricky because you could damage your wheel, rim, or tire if you’re not careful. The best choice, in this case, is a specialized bolt extractor. Press the extractor onto the lug nut and tap it with a hammer so it gets a good grip. Then grab it with a wrench or pliers and turn counterclockwise to get the nut off. [7] X Research source You can also use a bolt extractor to get off other types of nuts, not just on cars. Adding penetrating oil to the nut before using the bolt extractor helps loosen it up even more."
