      "content": "Make sure that you live in the right climate. Bermuda grass excels in sub-tropical climates such as the Southern US, South America, Australia, Africa, and India. If you live in a northern region or an area that's prone to freezing temperatures or droughts, consider using a different grass type. [2] X Research source There are also more expensive Bermuda grass hybrids that are more resilient to cold."

      "title": "Till the area until it's free of weeds and patches of grass.",
      "content": "Till the area until it's free of weeds and patches of grass. Rent or purchase a tilling machine online or at a hardware store. Roll the tiller over your lawn and lift up existing grass and weeds. This will allow you to plant your Bermuda grass without it having to compete with other grass or weeds in your yard. [3] X Research source If you can't get a mechanical tiller machine, you can use a manual tiller to till the soil. If you have ryegrass in your lawn, you'll have to kill it off because it contains toxins that stop Bermuda grass from growing. [4] X Research source You may have to till the soil more than once to remove any baby grass that starts to sprout after you till the yard initially."

      "title": "Rake away the dead grass and weeds.",
      "content": "Rake away the dead grass and weeds. Before you plant your Bermuda grass, you'll want to start with a fresh piece of land. After you've tilled the soil, you'll want to rake away dead grass and leaves so that you have a plot of land that doesn't have any new plant life growing out of the surface. [5] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Test the soil in your yard.",
      "content": "Test the soil in your yard. Bermuda grass grows best in soil with a pH of 5.6-7. To evaluate the pH level in your soil, you can get a sample of it tested at your local university's cooperative extension. If your soil is too acidic, you must add lime to amend the soil. If the soil is too alkaline, then you can amend the soil with sulfur to increase the acidity in the soil. [6] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Amend the soil.",
      "content": "Amend the soil. Bermuda grass does best in well-drained soil that's high in organic material. Clay soils are not good for the grass. Humus is the generic term used for soil that's high in organic material. You can purchase humus at a home and gardening store or online. You'll want to lay down at least 6 inches of humus before you plant your seeds or lay your sod. [7] X Research source"

      "title": "Rake over the area to even out the dirt.",
      "content": "Rake over the area to even out the dirt. Use a rake to go over the area that you've tilled to level out the dirt. You'll want to get rid of depressions and hills in your lawn so that the seeds have a nice flat surface to grow on. Fill in any depressions with soil. Remove any large rocks or leftover organic material before laying down your seeds. [8] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Plant the seeds.",
      "content": "Plant the seeds. You can plant the seeds by hand, or you can purchase a broadcast seeder to help you evenly disperse the seeds on your lawn. You'll want to use 1 - 2 pounds (453.59 - 907.18 g) per 1000 square feet (304.8 square meters) to promote a lush yard. Go over the entirety of the soil and try to evenly distribute the seeds.

      "title": "Cover the seeds with 1/4 inch of soil.",
      "content": "Cover the seeds with 1/4 inch of soil. Use a rake to go over the seeds and cover them with soil. Bermuda grass needs to be covered in soil to grow, but too much soil over your seeds will inhibit growth. All of the seeds should be lightly covered with a 1/8 to 1/4 inch (0.31 - 0.63 cm) layer over them. [10] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Water the seeds.",
      "content": "Water the seeds. Immediately after planting the grass, you should thoroughly water your yard so that the soil remains moist. Afterward, continue watering the yard daily. After watering the lawn, stick your finger in the soil to see if the top half inch (1.27 cm) of the soil is moist. [11] X Research source While Bermuda grass is a drought-tolerant grass, it requires a lot of water at first for the seeds to germinate. Keep the soil consistently moist for the first three weeks that the seeds are in the ground. Gradually decrease waterings as the turf matures."

      "title": "Apply fertilizer to the grass.",
      "content": "Apply fertilizer to the grass. If you haven't done a soil test to evaluate the surrounding soil, you can lay down a complete (N-P-K) turf-grade fertilizer with a 3-1-2 or 4-1-2 ratio. Purchase the fertilizer online or at a hardware store, then sprinkle it over your lawn. Bermuda grass will take 10-30 days to germinate under ideal conditions. [12] X Research source"

      "content": "Measure the area where you want to plant the sod. Sod is grass that's been pre-grown and can be rolled out on existing dirt. Before laying your sod, you'll need to know how much square footage of sod you'll need. Use a tape measure to measure your lawn and deduct areas where grass won't grow, like driveways or blacktops.

      "content": "Water your yard the night before. Irrigating your lawn with 1/4 to 1/2 inch (0.63 - 1.27 cm) of water the night before you plant your sod will prepare the area and will promote the healthy growth of your Bermuda grass. Water should not pool on top of the dirt, but it should penetrate into it. [14] X Research source If water pools on the surface of the dirt, it means you've watered it too much or that your soil contains too much clay. Add compost to the soil and till it in."

      "content": "Water your sod daily. Immediately after laying out all the sod, you'll want to water it thoroughly. Then, to maintain it, you should continue to water it every day in the morning. Keep foot traffic off the sod for at least a week after laying it to promote the health of your grass. If you water sod evening, it will be more prone to fungal infections during the night."
