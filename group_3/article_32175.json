Spraying over may result in loss of details or uneven gaps or thicknesses. It's easier than it sounds. Put some brake fluid in a bucket and then put the car body in it. It make take a day or two but the brake fluid will remove the paint. (You may need to hit some areas with an old toothbrush or other brush just don't use anything that will scratch the metal.)
