      "content": "Drink plenty of water. Water won’t instantly sober you up, but it helps your body gradually clear the marijuana out of your system. [1] X Research source So, make sure to stay hydrated before, during, and after your edible experience! Water can also help clear away the “cotton mouth” you might be feeling, as well as chewing on a stick of sugar-free gum or rinsing out your mouth with a dry mouth mouthwash . [2] X Trustworthy Source State of Oregon Official website for the State of Oregon Go to source Drinking lots of water can also help you get rid of any pesky weed hangover symptoms the next morning. [3] X Research source Cut back on caffeine while you’re recovering from your dry mouth so it doesn’t contribute to your symptoms."

      "content": "Grab a healthy snack and have a healthy breakfast the next day. Enjoy a small, healthy bite to eat, like a piece of fruit, a little bit of cheese, or a handful of nuts. Eating food can help ground you, which helps you recover from your high. [4] X Research source If you’re struggling with a weed hangover, enjoy a healthy, substantial, fruit-filled breakfast (your body absorbs the natural sugars in fruits more quickly as opposed to the refined sugars in some breakfast foods).

      "content": "Lie down and get some sleep. Your body knows what it needs—so, if you’re feeling really tired and low-energy, crawl into bed or take a snooze on the couch for the time being. [6] X Research source Giving yourself a chance to rest helps gives your brain a chance to clear the cobwebs out—that way, you can start feeling more clear-headed. [7] X Research source It’s okay if you’re not ready to head to bed just yet. Even a short nap can make a difference!"

      "content": "Chill out with some relaxing activities. If your edible has left you feeling a little anxious, choose a low-key activity to help you relax , like listening to some great tunes, putting on an episode of your favorite TV show, or hanging out with some friends. However you’re feeling now, it’s important to remember that the high is only temporary, and you’ll be feeling back to normal before you know it. [8] X Research source Hopping in the shower can be a relaxing way to start sobering up! A cold shower may help jolt you from your high, while a warm shower can be a great way to chill out and ground yourself. [9] X Research source Taking a nice, long shower in the morning (when you’re experiencing a weed hangover) can also help you feel better since it gets your body to produce endorphins.

[12] X Trustworthy Source MedlinePlus Collection of medical information sourced from the US National Library of Medicine Go to source Don’t overdo it, though! A simple walk around the neighborhood is a great way to get your blood pumping. See how you’re feeling before you do any type of exercise. If you’re feeling dizzy, woozy, or unwell overall, don’t try any sort of exercise. Getting a little exercise (like going for a walk) and enjoying the fresh air can also help you feel a little more levelheaded. [13] X Research source"

New research reports that painkillers like ibuprofen (as well as prescription medications like celecoxib/Celebrex) can help counteract some of the high you feel after using marijuana.

Terpenes are natural compounds found in a variety of plants—in fact, they’re responsible for the way plants look, taste, and smell (including cannabis). [16] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Black peppercorns happen to be rich in the alpha-pinene terpene, which, when paired with the THC in your system, helps you relax. If you feel like your brain’s going a mile a minute, gnawing on a couple of peppercorns may help you start feeling better. [17] X Research source Lemon slices might also help since they’re rich in limonene, a terpene that helps get rid of stress. [18] X Research source Keep in mind that not all terpenes are created equally—mangoes, for instance, contain a terpene called beta-myrcene, which has a sedative effect. If you eat a mango before you an eat an edible, your high can last even longer. [19] X Research source"

      "title": "The high from an edible can linger up to 12 hours.",
      "content": "The high from an edible can linger up to 12 hours. Unlike smoked or vaped weed, edibles are processed through the digestive system. Because of this, it takes longer for the initial high to kick in—plus, the after-effects of the high last a lot longer. An edible’s side effects can easily stick around for 12 hours, while some people feel leftover effects for up to a day after the fact. [22] X Research source Every person has a unique metabolism and body chemistry, so there’s not a “one size fits all” recovery time for edibles. Keep in mind that it takes a lot longer to reach the “peak” of your high when you’re eating an edible (as opposed to smoking/vaping weed). When you inhale weed , you get the peak effects after about half an hour; with edibles, it can take up to 4 hours to reach your peak. [23] X Research source"

The marijuana from your edibles can be spotted in your urine for anywhere from 1 to 30 days, and in your saliva for up to a day after the fact. Hair follicles are a different story—marijuana can be found in your hair for up to 3 months/90 days after your edible experience. [24] X Research source Sweat testing isn’t quite as long-term as hair follicle testing, but it can identify marijuana in your system up to 1-2 weeks after you’ve eaten an edible."

      "content": "Start with a 2.5 mg or smaller dose if you don’t have much experience. The high from an edible lasts much longer than the high from vaped/smoked marijuana, so it’s always best to start with a smaller dose. [25] X Research source If you’re somewhat experienced with edibles, you’re welcome to try a larger dose, like 5 mg or 10 mg. Just remember—it’s always better to start small!

Always pick up your weed from a dispensary; that way, you know for sure that your weed is good quality and not laced with pesticides, bacteria, mold, and other harmful substances. [27] X Research source Never use any type of synthetic marijuana (sometimes sold under brand names like Mr. Nice Guy, Bizarro, and Scooby Snax)—they’re essentially plant materials spritzed all over with chemicals (and possibly other drugs), and they’re extremely dangerous to use.

      "content": "Wait a few hours to feel the high from your edible. Edibles are processed through your digestive system, so they don’t provide the same quick high you’d get from inhaling weed (like through a bong, joint, or vaporizer). Don’t take another just because you don’t feel the effects right away, otherwise you might accidentally get uncomfortably high. [29] X Research source Edibles such as chocolate bars or brownies might take even longer to kick in, so be especially careful if you’re consuming these."

Warning: Never drive or operate any kind of heavy machinery while you’re high. If you’re expected to drive somewhere, save your edible for another day."
