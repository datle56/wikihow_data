Then, ask the clerk behind the counter for a play slip for you to pick your own numbers on the ticket. Some lottery retailers will have a container full of blank play slips that you can pull a slip from. For a list of retailers that sell Powerball tickets, go to your state’s lottery website and search for “Find a Retailer” on the page. Note : Powerball is available to play in every state except AL, AK, HI, NV, and UT. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Check the Power Play box to boost your winnings. You can increase all non-jackpot winnings by 2, 3, 4, 5, or 10 times by selecting the Power Play feature. Simply mark the box labeled “Yes” under the Power Play section on the left-hand side of the slip. [4] X Research source Power Play doesn’t increase your chances of winning, but it can multiply the amount that you receive if you do win. The Power Play feature costs an extra $1. In Idaho and Montana, Power Play is automatically added to your ticket. The Power Play multiplier is randomly chosen before each Powerball drawing. The 10x multiplier is only available if the jackpot is less than $150 million."

      "content": "Decide how you want to be paid if you win the jackpot. When you purchase most Powerball tickets, you have an option to choose how you would like to be paid if you win the jackpot. Choose between annual payments or cash value (lump sum) by marking the corresponding box. [5] X Research source The annual payment option means you’ll be given 30 graduated payments over 29 years that add up to the grand prize amount. The cash value option means that you’ll receive a single payment of the net value of the grand prize. The cash value amount is less than the advertised jackpot amount because the jackpot is based on what 30 annual payments equate to. Note : If your ticket doesn’t have a payment choice option, most states give you 60 days to decide how you want to be paid. [6] X Research source"

[8] X Research source Most Powerball tickets have 5 games that you can play (labeled board A through E). Each game costs $2, so if you decide to play all 5 games, your ticket costs $10. The play slip isn’t your Powerball ticket. It’s just a way for you to pick your own numbers."

[22] X Research source If you have the means, consider playing 26 games and selecting a new Powerball number for each game. This ensures you win at least 1 game—matching the Powerball number earns you $4. Remember that your odds of winning the Powerball jackpot are 1 in 292 million, regardless of how many games you play. [23] X Research source The odds of winning any prize is 1 in 24.87. So, playing more games gives you more of an opportunity to win a prize."

Your odds of winning the Powerball jackpot are 1 in 292 million, regardless if you choose your numbers or get randomly generated numbers from a quick pick ticket. However, the majority of players choose randomly generated numbers, which means the majority of winners win on quick pick tickets. [24] X Research source Pros of getting a quick pick ticket : It’s less likely that you’ll share numbers with other people (and thus less likely that you’ll have to share your winnings), as the numbers are random. The tickets are also usually faster and less stressful to fill out. Pros of choosing your own numbers : You get to control which numbers you select, which may be lucky, important to you, or based on certain strategies. Consider buying at least 2 games so you get to choose your own numbers for one game and get random numbers for the other."
