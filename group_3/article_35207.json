Of the 6 columns on a binary clock, the 2 left-hand columns show the hours, the middle 2 columns show the minutes, and the 2 right-hand columns show the seconds. Of the 4 rows on a binary clock, the bottom row on a binary clock represents the number 1, the next row represents the number 2, the following row represents the number 4, and the top row represents the number 8. [1] X Research source Remember that columns are vertical and rows are horizontal. You can number the columns 1-6, from left to right, to help you keep track of which is which. Of each set of columns, the one on the left represents the 10s place while the one on the right represents the 1s place. The numbers for each row are derived from the power of 2. The first row represents 2 0 (1), the second represents 2 1 (2), the third is 2 2 (4), and the top row represents 2 3 (8)."
