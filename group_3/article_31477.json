Although the forms are long, depending on what boxes you tick in the opening pages can change how much of the form you need to complete.

Most of the forms require different information from you, but they have several shared characteristics such as the legal name of your organisation, specific high level staff, tax identification number, address information, state license number and medicare identification number if you already have one."
