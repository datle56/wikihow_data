      "content": "Ask your partner to fill you in on the crucial details. [1] X Expert Source Shana Tibi Certified Professional Matchmaker Expert Interview. 19 October 2021. What are their names and what do they prefer to be called? What do they do for work? Are they divorced? What are their passions? Ask your partner to share a few interesting family facts and find out if there are any hot-button topics to steer clear of. [2] X Research source Your partner might find these questions a bit funny or silly, but you'll save yourself a lot of awkwardness by finding out these details in advance. Do a little research of your own by checking out their social media accounts."

      "title": "Aim to look well-groomed, neat, and presentable.",
      "content": "Aim to look well-groomed, neat, and presentable. First, consider the occasion: are you going to a fancy restaurant, an outdoor barbeque, or a casual dinner at their home? Once you know that, you can choose an appropriate outfit. You can’t go wrong with clean, wrinkle-free clothes that look sharp and fit well. [3] X Research source Some additional tips to help you out: Skip outlandish, quirky, or revealing clothes. When in doubt, go conservative. Err on the dressy side; overdressed is better than under-dressed. Business casual attire (nice slacks, long-sleeved button-up, fitted blazer, and a tasteful piece of jewelry) works well in most situations. If you still aren’t sure what to wear, ask your partner for help."

      "content": "Punctuality shows that you’re respectful and responsible. Showing up late makes a pretty poor first impression. Find out exactly what time you’re supposed to arrive and get there 10 minutes early. If something beyond your control happens to make you late, just call ahead to let them know and offer a sincere apology once you arrive. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "If you're going to their home, a small gift is a nice gesture. For a dinner gathering, ask if they’d like you to bring an appetizer, side dish, or dessert with you. A nice bottle of red wine is a classic option that works well. [5] X Research source Showing up with flowers for your partner’s mother is always a classy move.

      "content": "Consider silencing it or turning on \"Do Not Disturb\" mode. You'll make a better impression if you're fully engaged in the conversation. Even if you feel a little awkward, avoid the urge to text your bestie a full report until after you leave. [9] X Research source If you do get an important phone call, politely excuse yourself by saying something like, \"I'm so sorry, I have to take this.\" Step out of the room to take the call, and return as quickly as possible."

      "title": "Remembering details can show that you care.",
      "content": "Remembering details can show that you care. Think back to any of the things your partner shared about your parents, or anything you might have seen on their social media pages. Then, use that as a conversation starter if things start to stall. [10] X Research source For instance, you might say, \"Mrs. Ingram, your son mentioned you were promoted recently at work. Congratulations!\" Or, you might say, \"Mr. Singh, I understand you served in the military. My father was in the Army. I'm sure the two of you would have lots to talk about.\""

You usually can’t go wrong if you compliment them on their beautiful home or the delicious dinner they served. If they have amazing artwork hanging in the foyer, praise the pieces and ask about them. Don’t overdo it, though; nonstop compliments come off as insincere. [12] X Research source You might say, “I love the greenhouse you have attached to your house! It feels like a tropical jungle in there.\" You can always go the charming route and compliment the parents on how well they raised your partner. Compliments can be nonverbal, too! For example, if they made dinner, ask for seconds."

      "title": "Show interest in their lives and ask open-ended questions.",
      "content": "Show interest in their lives and ask open-ended questions. When they tell you something about themselves or answer one of your questions, build on that by asking follow-up questions to get more details. If you aren’t sure where to start, you can always ask questions about something interesting in the room or elsewhere in their home. [14] X Research source For example, “That painting over the fireplace is absolutely gorgeous. Do you love collecting artwork?” You might say, \"Sarah tells me you lived in Germany for a year when you were in the military. I studied abroad in Germany last summer. Did you enjoy your time there?\" Avoid sensitive topics like religion and politics. Safe topics include classical music, jazz, wine, beer, cars, crafts, pets, gardening, and literature."

      "content": "Be respectful and gracious if they question you. It's only natural for your partner's parents to be curious about you, so don't be surprised if they have some tough questions. They might ask about your plans for the future, including your intentions for your relationship. Just do your best to answer honestly and with an open, positive attitude. [15] X Research source If they ask anything that's too private, it's fine to say something like, \"I'm sorry, I'm not really comfortable talking about that. I hope you understand!\" Then, give them a smile and change the subject."

      "content": "Don't ignore your partner while you're talking to their parents. Keep in mind that your partner is probably feeling a little nervous about this meeting, too. Every so often, address a comment or question to them, or even just glance over and give them a little smile. That will help them feel like things are going well—which may help their parents feel more at ease, too. [18] X Research source Avoid going overboard with PDA while the parents are around, though. A little hand-holding is probably fine, or even a quick kiss on the cheek, but keep it family-friendly. [19] X Research source"
