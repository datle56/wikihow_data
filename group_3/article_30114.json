A typical veil would come down to your fingertips, but other popular lengths include shoulder, elbow, floor, chapel, and cathedral. Your veil should drape without showing any skin at the sides of your face. [1] X Expert Source Margo West Professional Tailor Expert Interview. 7 December 2020."

      "content": "Purchase the tulle. Look for something that is around 72 inches (182.88 centimeters) wide. If you are making a shorter veil (ie: shoulder length), consider getting something that is around 55 inches (139.7 centimeters) wide. If you are making a really long veil (ie: floor or chapel), consider getting 108-inch (274.32-centimeter) wide tulle instead. This way, it will be more proportionate."

      "content": "Cut the bottom of your veil into a rounded rectangle, if desired. You can leave your veil rectangular, but a rounded bottom will give you a nicer shape. Lay your tulle out with the bottom edge facing you. Fold the tulle in half, then cut the bottom (loose) corners off so that they are rounded. Your veil may look a lot wider than it is long at this point, but that is alright. Use a rotary cutter to cut your tulle—not hand scissors. That will help eliminate the chance that the edges will appear choppy. [2] X Expert Source Margo West Professional Tailor Expert Interview. 7 December 2020.

      "content": "Consider adding some trim to the rounded edge. You don't really have to do this, but since it is your special day, why not go full-out and make yourself feel like a princess? You can hand-sew a beaded trim for something more delicate. You can also sew some narrow, white, satin ribbon instead. If you are sewing ribbon onto the edge, sew it an inch or two (2.54 to 5.08 centimeters) away from the edge first, then trim off the excess tulle. If you're planning to add trim, use a tulle that has a stiffer feel to it. [4] X Expert Source Margo West Professional Tailor Expert Interview. 7 December 2020."

If you choose to do it on a machine, sew two rows, about ½-inch (1.27-centimeter) apart. For a full veil, sew all the way across the top, straight edge. For a less-full veil, sew across the center part, leaving a gap on either side."

Spread the tulle down on the table or floor, with the original folded edge facing you. Grab the right narrow edge, and bring it towards the left narrow edge. Smooth the fabric down and make sure that everything is even. If the tulle is too long, you can cut it down at this point."

Trace an arc using a marker, then cut it out. Make sure that the arc is going towards the bottom-right corner (the one with all the folds). This way, when you unfold the fabric, you'll get a rounded rectangle."

      "content": "Unfold the tulle, then fold it in half partway. Unfold the tulle first so that you have a rounded rectangle. Bring one of the narrow edges towards the other end. This is your second tier, so how far you fold it is up to you. You can fold it all the way over to the other edge, or leave a small gap. Double-check the length again. If the veil is too long, cut it shorter, and adjust the layers as needed. Your veil may look much wider than it is long at this point. Don't worry, this is how it's supposed to be!

It is made from stiffer lace that goes across your face, like a birdcage. is great for vintage-themed weddings."

[7] X Research source If you want the veil to completely wrap around your head, measure the circumference of your head, add a couple of inches, and use that measurement for the width instead. [8] X Research source You can always cut your veil longer than 9 inches (22.86 centimeters), especially if you want it to go past your chin. Try to cut straight across the connecting \"dots\" between the diamonds. This will give you a cleaner, neater finish. [9] X Research source"

[13] X Research source You will need to do this by hand, not on a sewing machine. Use clear thread or a thread color that matches your netting. Sew through the last row of diamonds.

Adjust the gathers so that they fall between the knots at each end of your sewing. This will give you a neater finish."
