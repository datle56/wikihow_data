      "content": "Give each player a set of 15 checkers and a pair of dice. Separate the checkers by their color and give a full set to each of the players. Then hand each person 2 6-sided dice to roll during the game. [1] X Research source You can share the same pair of dice if you don’t have enough for both players. If your backgammon set has a doubling cube with numbers on it, you can set it aside for now. You don’t need to play with it if you’re just learning the game."

      "content": "Set the backgammon board in between the players. Sit across from the person you’re playing with and position the board so the narrow triangles (known as “points”) are in front of you. The backgammon board has 2 halves separated by the bar in the middle. Each half has 2 quadrants with 6 points. The 2 quadrants on one half of the board are the players’ “home boards,” and the quadrants on the other half are the players’ “outer boards.” [2] X Research source In a traditional game of backgammon, the home board is on the right side for the white player and the left for the black player."

      "content": "Arrange your checkers on your 6th, 8th, 13th, and 24th point. The points are numbered 1–24 for each player, wrapping around from one player’s home board to the other. Each player’s points are numbered in opposite directions, so your 1st point is the other player’s 24th point. Place 5 checkers on your 6th point, 3 on your 8th point, 5 on your 13th point (the point in the outer corner of your opponent’s outer board), and 2 on your 24th point. [3] X Research source Lay the checkers out flat instead of stacking them so it’s easier to see how many are on the board. None of your checkers should ever be on the same points as the other player. If you have any spots where your pieces overlap, find the correct points on the board to move the pieces to."

      "title": "Remove all 15 checkers from your home board to win the game.",
      "content": "Remove all 15 checkers from your home board to win the game. Every turn, you’ll roll dice and move your checkers around the points so they get closer and closer to your home board. [4] X Research source Once you have all of your checkers on your home side of the board, you can start removing them (or “bearing them off”) from the board instead of moving them. As soon as you take your last checker off the board, you win! While you’re trying to move your checkers closer to your home board, remember the other player is doing the same. Even though the game is a race to finish, there’s a lot of strategy for positioning and blocking your opponent’s moves."

      "content": "Have each player roll 1 die to determine who moves first. Take one of your dice and roll them near the board. Whoever rolled the higher number gets to start the game using the numbers that were just rolled. After the first turn, each player rolls their own pair of dice. [5] X Research source If you both rolled the same number, roll the dice again until one of you has a higher number. Some backgammon sets have dice cups for rolling the dice, but rolling them inside of the board or on the table works fine too."

You can either move 1 checker the total number of spaces from your roll, or you can split the movement between 2 checkers. Choose which checkers you’re using, and move them the number of points down the board. As long as the point you land on doesn’t have 2 or more enemy pieces, then it’s a legal move. Once you finish moving, it’s the other player’s turn. [6] X Research source Example: You roll a 5 and a 3. You can either move one checker 5 points and another 3 points. Alternatively, you can move a single checker a total of 8 spaces, either by going 5 spaces followed by 3 or 3 spaces followed by 5. If you roll doubles, you get to use the dice roll again. If you rolled a pair of 6s, then you can move up to 4 separate checkers 6 spaces each. You have to move a checker if you’re able to. If you can’t move any checkers because you’re blocked, then you lose your turn."

      "content": "Roll dice and remove pieces from the points on your home board. Roll your dice just like you would on your other turns. If there are any checkers on the point that matches one of the dice, then you can take it off the board permanently. If there isn’t a checker on the point from your die roll but there are checkers higher than it, you must move those checkers instead. For example, if you roll a 4 but still have a checker on the 5th point, you would have to move that checker to your 1st point. If the point you rolled doesn’t have a checker and there aren’t any higher checkers, then you can bear off a piece from the next highest point. So if you roll a 4, you could instead take a checker off of the 3rd point."

When your opponent couldn’t bear off checkers and they still have a checker on the bar, then they’ve been “backgammoned” and you win points three times the value of the cube."
