      "content": "Choose a sweater with a thick weave to make it easier to hang the ornaments. Especially if you want to re-wear the sweater without ornaments attached, a thick weave will really help you hang and remove ornaments without ripping the sweater or putting too many holes into it. Stick with a fun Christmas color, like green or red, or go more neutral with a brown or tan sweater. [1] X Research source A baggier sweater will work better for this DIY since it won’t press as tightly against your body. Visit a thrift store to find a great option."

      "title": "Gather an assortment of ornaments and a variety of bows.",
      "content": "Gather an assortment of ornaments and a variety of bows. Use ornaments that you wouldn’t mind if they accidentally got broken or banged up. Thrift stores often have sets of old ornaments, or you can find inexpensive packs at the dollar store. For the bows, use gift wrap stick-on ones, fabric bows, or use wire-edged ribbon to make bows yourself . [2] X Research source Anywhere from 15-30 ornaments should be good for your sweater. Keep in mind that they definitely don’t need to match, and they don’t need to be super attractive, either. For a flashier sweater, opt for glitter-covered ornaments. They’ll add sparkle to your outfit, and they’ll catch lots of light, making you the star of the party."

      "title": "Lay out the sweater on a flat surface to space out the ornaments.",
      "content": "Lay out the sweater on a flat surface to space out the ornaments. Play around with the spacing before you actually attach anything. Maybe you want to line the collar, sleeves, or bottom of the shirt. Maybe you want to cover the entire surface of the sweater with as many ornaments as you can fit. [3] X Research source For this kind of ugly sweater, it’s best to decorate only the front side. If you do the back, it’s more likely you’ll accidentally break some ornaments if you sit down or lean against something."

    {
      "title": "Secure the ornaments and bows into place with hooks or wire.",
      "content": "Secure the ornaments and bows into place with hooks or wire. Once everything is in the place where you want, thread hooks or wire through the ornament’s hole, thread that through the sweater, and tie it off or twist it so that the ornament won’t come loose. [4] X Research source If you’re using stick-on bows, you don’t need to worry about using hooks on them."

      "title": "Put your sweater on carefully so that you don’t knock off any ornaments.",
      "content": "Put your sweater on carefully so that you don’t knock off any ornaments. Try putting your arms through first and then bringing the body of the sweater down as slowly and carefully as you can. If you need to, ask a friend to help! [5] X Research source At the end of the night, you could just take off the sweater. If you want to try and save some of the ornaments, you could undo them first."

      "content": "Thrift an inexpensive sweater or cardigan. For this particular DIY, it doesn’t matter what color the sweater is since the whole thing will be covered in garland. But, if you’re worried about the color of the sweater showing through, pick a red, green, or black one. [6] X Research source If you choose a cardigan, make sure you have a red, green, white, or black T-shirt to wear underneath."

      "content": "Gather together several yards of garland. Green, red, gold, silver—pick just one or do a mix-and-match of several different colors! You’ll need enough to wrap around the entire body of the sweater, including the arms. [7] X Research source You can find garland at craft stores or at the dollar store."

      "content": "Use a glue gun to cover the entire body of the sweater with garland. Lay the sweater out on a flat surface. Starting at the bottom of the sweater, coat a strip of the fabric with hot glue. Lay the garland overtop of the glued section and press down on it. Continue flipping the sweater over and attaching the garland in sections until the entire sweater is done. [8] X Research source Hot glue dries really fast! Each section should be done within 1-2 minutes of it being applied, but for the best results, wait at least 30 minutes before you wear your sweater. Don’t forget to wrap each arm separately with garland."

      "content": "Add ornaments and bows to make your sweater even flashier. Once the garland is in place and has dried, use your glue gun to secure some ornaments to the sweater. Bulbs or balls work really well and will stand out nicely against the shine of the garland. You could even use candy canes, pompoms, or small decorative items. [9] X Research source Feel free to get as creative as you want with the additions to your sweater. There’s no right or wrong way to do it!"

Or, go to a thrift store to find a used green sweater. [10] X Research source Any shade of green works for this project. Bright green would be really eye-catching; dark green would resemble the actual color of a tree more realistically."

      "content": "Use a hot glue gun to attach strands of garland around the sweater. Use silver, gold, or red garland for the most holiday-themed effect. Wrap the garland around the sweater starting at the bottom in an upwards spiral, mimicking what you would do on an actual Christmas tree. Once you know where you want the garland to be, apply hot glue to the sweater and press the garland down into place. Although the glue dries quickly, wait about 30 minutes so it has time to fully dry and set before you move on to the next steps. [11] X Research source Don’t forget to put garland on the sleeves of the sweater, too. Depending on how much garland you have, you could do just the front of the sweater. Or, if you have enough, do both the front and the back."

      "content": "Add a few ornaments along each strand of garland. Use your hot glue gun to attach a few flashy ornaments along the length of the garland. Do this just on the front of the sweater; if you put ornaments on the back, they’d be more likely to break if you sat down or leaned against something."

A gold or silver star would traditionally look the best, but don’t be afraid to get something flashier—like one covered in glitter or one that is multi-colored. You can often find these at the dollar store, craft store, or even at the thrift store. You’ll carry the star in one of your hands at the party, so make sure it isn’t too heavy to have with you all night."

At the party, show off your costume by extending your arms straight up over your head and putting your hands together. Hold the star in your hands so it becomes the top of the Christmas tree. To make your outfit look even more like a traditional Christmas tree, cut a tree skirt in half and attach it to the bottom of your sweater with the hot glue gun. Position the skirt so that the ruffles are facing down."

Pick a favorite Christmas or holiday movie, and use colored pieces of felt to cut out images from a famous scene from the movie. Use a hot glue gun to arrange the scene on your sweater. [13] X Research source For example, A Christmas Story , Elf , National Lampoon’s Christmas Vacation , Home Alone , How the Grinch Stole Christmas , and many other films have great scenes you could replicate on your sweater. For How the Grinch Stole Christmas , you could cut out the Grinch’s face wearing a Santa hat. For A Christmas Story, you could make a large metal pole or a turkey. Use a black marker to add fine details to the felt."

Lay the sweater down on a flat surface, and arrange the ties so that they spread out across the body of the sweater from the neckline. Use a hot glue gun to attach the ties to your sweater.

Attach the hat to your sweater with a hot glue gun. Underneath the sweater, attach a lightweight mirror. Underneath the mirror, use cotton balls to create a beard.

Use shades of brown felt to cut out the front and back halves of a reindeer. One of your sweaters will be the front half, and the other will be the back. Attach the felt using a hot glue gun. When you stand together, the reindeer should appear whole. For even more decorative fun, attach different colored Christmas bows to each of your sweaters so that it looks like the reindeer is expelling them from either end."
