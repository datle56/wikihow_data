      "title": "Chew gum for a minute or two.",
      "content": "Chew gum for a minute or two. Any type of chewing gum or bubblegum should work. Chew a wad of gum until all of it is soft and flexible. Sugared gum and sugarless gum have different consistencies, so you might want to try both kinds to see which is easier to snap."
    },
    {
      "title": "Flatten the gum in your mouth.",
      "content": "Flatten the gum in your mouth. Press it against the roof of your mouth with your tongue until it forms a flat, unbroken disc or rectangle. There are a couple of different ways you can flatten the gum. Any method you use for blowing a bubble should work, but stop before the gum is fully stretched out."
    },
    {
      "title": "Stretch the gum between the back of your upper teeth and the back of your lower teeth.",
      "content": "Stretch the gum between the back of your upper teeth and the back of your lower teeth. Use your tongue to push the gum up behind your upper lip, in front of your upper front teeth. Wedge one end of the gum firmly in that area. Push the other end of the gum behind your lower teeth, on the inside of your mouth. The gum should still be all in one piece, without any tears. [1] X Research source Some people put the lower end in front of the bottom teeth instead or in the center of the mouth."

      "title": "Suck in the air.",
      "content": "Suck in the air. Part your lips slightly, so there's a gap between them. Suck a short burst of air in quickly, and some of the gum should snap back into your mouth, making a noise. You might need to practice for a while before you can get this. Even once you learn it, it might not happen every time."
    },
    {
      "title": "Form the gum into a bubble.",
      "content": "Form the gum into a bubble. Flatten the gum into a disk, just like you would in the normal snap method. Stick your tongue through the disk without breaking it, then withdraw your tongue and clamp the edges together to make a sealed air bubble. Chew to pop this bubble and make a snapping noise. Blowing into the bubble as you pull out your tongue might help."
    },
    {
      "title": "Fold it into a dumpling shape instead.",
      "content": "Fold it into a dumpling shape instead. Some people find it faster to fold the gum in half instead. Bring one end over to the other, sealing the sides and ends with your teeth and the sides of your mouth. If you manage to do this correctly, you'll end up with a \"dumpling\" of air, which pops just like an ordinary bubble."

    {
      "title": "Practice snapping repeatedly.",
      "content": "Practice snapping repeatedly. If you want to snap gum many times as you chew, you'll have to practice one of the two steps above until you can do it rapidly or even unconsciously. Once you learn these larger motions, you can try making the bubbles smaller and smaller, until you can form them just by folding the gum over and chewing. Chewing too hard or too soft will prevent the bubbles from forming and making noise, so it takes quite a bit of practice before you can get a steady stream of snaps. [2] X Research source"
