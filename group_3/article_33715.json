      "title": "Stand with one foot angled away from the other.",
      "content": "Stand with one foot angled away from the other. Having both of your feet planted at the same angle will make the rest of your body look stiff and blocky. Instead, turn one foot to a slight angle to the other. [1] X Research source If you'd prefer, you can cross one leg in front of the other, instead. Shots where it looks like you're walking can be very flattering, as well. [2] X Research source Lift slightly onto your toes to look taller."

      "title": "Turn at a 30-45° angle toward the camera to look slimmer.",
      "content": "Turn at a 30-45° angle toward the camera to look slimmer. Shooting straight-on will emphasize the width of your shoulders, chest, and waist. If you'd prefer for these areas to look more narrow, turn away from the camera at a slight angle. [3] X Research source If you have a \"good side,\" make sure you angle yourself so that is the side facing the camera."

    {
      "title": "Shoot with the camera angled down to make your face look more defined.",
      "content": "Shoot with the camera angled down to make your face look more defined. Have the person taking the picture stand so the camera is slightly above your eye level. Then, look up into the camera to create a flattering angle that focuses on your beautiful eyes! [4] X Research source This approach works for close-up photos as well as shots that include your whole body."
    },
    {
      "title": "Face the light.",
      "content": "Face the light. Before you take a picture, turn so you're facing into a soft light source. This will give you a flattering glow, whereas standing with your back to the light can create harsh, unflattering shadows on your face. For instance, if you're indoors, you might face the center of the room, or you might stand near a window facing outward."

      "content": "Roll your shoulders back. Before you take the picture, straighten your back, lengthen your neck, and roll your shoulders back. [5] X Expert Source Traci Halvorson Modeling Agent Expert Interview. 17 June 2021. Whether the picture will be of just your face or your whole body, having good posture will help you look and feel more confident, and that's going to translate into a better pic. [6] X Research source Keeping your shoulders rolled back will also make your neck look longer, which will create more definition around your chin and jawline. [7] X Research source Good posture helps you like slimmer in front of the camera. [8] X Expert Source Traci Halvorson Modeling Agent Expert Interview. 17 June 2021."

      "title": "Pose in front of an uncluttered background.",
      "content": "Pose in front of an uncluttered background. Do a quick scan behind you to make sure there's nothing that will pull the focus away from you. If there is, angle the shot so you can't see whatever's in the background, or pick another location to shoot. No matter how cute you look, if there's a distracting image in the background of your photo, that's all anyone will see. [9] X Research source For instance, make sure there aren't any objects behind you that will look like they're coming out of your head, like a stop sign or a tree branch. You might also check for people, trash, or even just an unmade bed. For a cool, artistic feel, try standing in front of a brightly-colored wall. However, avoid backdrops with busy patterns, as they can be distracting."

    {
      "title": "Keep your mouth and face relaxed.",
      "content": "Keep your mouth and face relaxed. Gently close your lips, then imagine drawing just the corners of your mouth up into a slight smile. This will keep your facial muscles relaxed, and combined with the look in your eyes, it can result in an intriguing photo that will pull the viewer in and leave them wondering what your secret is. [10] X Research source For a more mischievous look, try only smiling with one corner of your mouth."
    },
    {
      "title": "Keep your arms slightly bent.",
      "content": "Keep your arms slightly bent. To look relaxed and natural, bend your arms slightly at your elbows. You can also place one or both hands on your hips, if you'd like, but keep your elbows pushed back so you still look like you're at ease. [11] X Research source If you want your arms to appear more muscular, keep them tight against your body. However, if you'd prefer your arms to look more slender, hold them slightly away from your body. [12] X Research source If you cross your arms, keep them crossed loosely to avoid looking tense."

      "title": "Interact naturally if there are other people in the photo.",
      "content": "Interact naturally if there are other people in the photo. If you're posing for a couple's photo or a group shot, act relaxed, and try to pose so that everyone is doing something slightly different. However, don't be afraid to connect with the other people in the shot—making eye contact, holding hands, or putting your arms around each other can all add warmth to the shot. [13] X Research source For instance, if you're taking a photo with a group of your friends, you might drape your arm over the person next to you. In a couple's photo, you might embrace your significant other and look into the camera. If you're in doubt about what to do, just try to pose in a way that looks relaxed and natural for you."

      "title": "Opt for a solid-colored or simple background.",
      "content": "Opt for a solid-colored or simple background. In a professional photograph, you should be the main focus. Ask your photographer to shoot you in front of a plain backdrop. Or, if you'd prefer, you can shoot in your office or another professional setting. Just make sure the shot is framed so it's free of anything that will distract the viewer from the shot of you. [14] X Research source For instance, if you're a doctor, if you choose to shoot a professional picture in your examination room, make sure to clear the counters of promotional materials and samples so the shot will be uncluttered."

      "title": "Take several deep breaths to relax.",
      "content": "Take several deep breaths to relax. If you feel nervous or tense in front of the camera, that's going to show in your body and your face when you look at your photos. To help yourself feel more comfortable, take several long, deep breaths, which will help you release any tension that you might be holding in. [15] X Research source For instance, try breathing in for 4 counts, holding your breath for 4 counts, and exhaling for 4 counts. Repeat that 2 or 3 times, or until you start to feel calm."

    {
      "title": "Face into the nearest light source.",
      "content": "Face into the nearest light source. When you're taking a professional headshot or another picture where you need to look business-like, try to sit or stand so your face is turned toward the brightest light in the room. That way, there won't be any shadows obscuring your face in the finished photo. If you're working with a professional photographer, they may provide their own light source, or they may use reflectors to bounce light back onto your face."

      "title": "Push your tongue against your teeth to create a genuine smile.",
      "content": "Push your tongue against your teeth to create a genuine smile. If you want to look like you're having a great time, smile widely, then press your tongue against the back of your top teeth in the front of your mouth. This will help lift your cheeks, which will result in a more natural-looking smile. [16] X Research source For an even more natural smile, think of someone or something you really love while you're posing."

      "title": "Experiment with looking into the camera or off in the distance.",
      "content": "Experiment with looking into the camera or off in the distance. When you look into the camera, you'll project confidence and boldness. Keep your eyes soft, but don't be afraid to give a direct stare. However, if you'd prefer more of a candid look, try looking into the middle distance, instead. To feel comfortable in front of the camera, spend about 10 minutes standing in front of a mirror practicing poses and facial expressions so you know what angles are best for you."

    {
      "title": "Hold a prop if you need something to do with your hands.",
      "content": "Hold a prop if you need something to do with your hands. Grab a cup of coffee, your phone, or even a purse strap before you take the shot. That way, you won't have to worry about how to hold your hands, and you can look and act more natural while your picture is being taken. [17] X Research source If you don't have anything nearby that you can use as a prop, try lightly holding one of your wrists with the other hand. You can also touch your cuff or your collar, or you can tuck your hair behind your ears. If you put your hands in your pockets, try to keep your elbows angled slightly back."

      "content": "Stand up straight with your shoulders back. Having good posture will make you look taller and create more flattering angles, but it will also make you look more confident. [18] X Expert Source Traci Halvorson Modeling Agent Expert Interview. 17 June 2021. When you look like you feel good about yourself, you'll be able to project a more professional appearance, so your clients will feel more confident in your abilities, as well. [19] X Research source It can sometimes help to picture a string running all the way from the bottom of your spine through the top of your head. Imagine that someone is pulling on the top of that string to help lift your posture."

      "title": "Angle your body toward the camera to look slimmer.",
      "content": "Angle your body toward the camera to look slimmer. Instead of taking the picture straight on, which can make you look broader, try turning about 30°-40° away from the camera. Combined with good posture, this will make you look taller, slimmer, and more confident, which may help boost your professional image. [20] X Research source If you'd prefer more of a straight-on shot but you'd still like this slimming effect, stand at an angle, then turn your shoulders back toward the camera. This will make your waist and hips look more narrow. If you have a broad chest and muscular arms and you want to show them off to give your picture more of an authoritative feel, cross your arms over your chest and stand facing the camera straight on. Try not to lean toward the camera when you pose for the shot. [21] X Expert Source Traci Halvorson Modeling Agent Expert Interview. 17 June 2021."

    {
      "title": "Bend your arms and legs to look more natural.",
      "content": "Bend your arms and legs to look more natural. Standing or sitting with your arms and legs straight out will make you look stiff and uncomfortable. Instead, try posing so your limbs form natural angles, like standing with one knee slightly bent and a hand on your hip, or sitting with your legs crossed. [22] X Research source Hold your arms away from your body slightly if you want them to look more slender, or press them into your sides if you want them to look more muscular. [23] X Research source If you need help deciding what to do with your hands, try holding a prop that's related to your profession. For instance, if you're a teacher, you might hold a pen, and if you're a cook, you might use a spatula."

      "title": "Have the photographer shoot slightly upward if you want to look more powerful.",
      "content": "Have the photographer shoot slightly upward if you want to look more powerful. If you're taking a photo where your whole body will show and you want to look taller and leaner, ask the person taking the picture to hold the camera just below your eye level. Then, they can tilt the camera up slightly to make sure your whole body is in the frame. This will make you look authoritative and powerful, so be sure to adopt a confident pose! [24] X Research source Typically, it's best if you stand a little further away from the camera for this shot. This angle can emphasize the area under your chin, so keep your head tilted upward. This will produce a stylish shot, but it's not the most flattering for everyone. Try shooting a few frames like this, then check the camera roll to see if you like the way it looks!"

      "title": "Hold the camera slightly above your eye level for a flattering shot.",
      "content": "Hold the camera slightly above your eye level for a flattering shot. When you're taking a selfie, it's usually most flattering if you hold the camera up and angle it slightly downward. Then, look up into the camera, lifting your eyebrows slightly. That will give you a wide-eyed, fresh look that's picture-perfect. [25] X Research source"

      "content": "Play around with different angles to add variety to your feed. While the top-down look is a great angle for most people, don't be afraid to experiment with different shots, especially if you'll be posting a lot of selfies! For instance, you might try holding the camera off to the side, or you might stand in front of a mirror to show off a cool outfit. [26] X Research source Your followers might get bored if you only post pictures of yourself from the exact same angle every time."

      "title": "Turn so you're facing into the light.",
      "content": "Turn so you're facing into the light. Just like if someone else is taking a picture of you, you'll get the most flattering glow if you angle your face toward the nearest light source. Just be sure to avoid direct sunlight, which can leave harsh shadows on your face. If you're in direct sunlight, find a shaded spot nearby where you can take your selfie. If you don't have good lighting, try using your camera's flash. You can also invest in a portable ring light if you want great selfie lighting wherever you go!"

      "title": "Lengthen your neck and sit or stand up straight.",
      "content": "Lengthen your neck and sit or stand up straight. Imagine that there's a string coming out of the top of your head, pulling your body straight up. Lift your head and neck, and push your shoulders down. [27] X Research source This will create a long line that will emphasize the curve of your neck and shoulders."

    {
      "title": "Exhale softly to make your lips look full and relaxed.",
      "content": "Exhale softly to make your lips look full and relaxed. Whether you're smiling, scowling, or pouting, it's easy to accidentally tighten your mouth when you're focused on taking a selfie. To keep your mouth relaxed, gently blow air through your lips right before you snap the picture. [28] X Research source Don't let your cheeks fill up with air as you do this, or your face will appear rounder than it is! Try squinting your eyes slightly to mimic the way your eyes crinkle when you smile naturally."

    {
      "title": "Take a lot of shots, then study them to discover your best angles.",
      "content": "Take a lot of shots, then study them to discover your best angles. Snap as many pictures as you can stand to, making tiny changes in your facial expression and the angles of your head and body. Then, go through your camera roll. Study the photos to see what you like and don't like. As you get more experienced, you'll start to learn the angles that are most flattering to your face, and posing for a selfie will most likely start to feel more natural. [29] X Research source Everyone's perfect angle is different, and finding what works for you can take some experimentation. For instance, you might shoot from above if you have a big chin, but you might shoot from the side or below if you have a big forehead."

    {
      "title": "Look for interesting backdrops to include in your selfies.",
      "content": "Look for interesting backdrops to include in your selfies. Don't just recreate the same shot all the time. Instead, take selfies in a wide variety of different spots, and try to include at least a little of the background in the frame. That way, every selfie will offer something new to the viewer—and it's a great way to keep track of your favorite experiences, too! For instance, you might take a selfie standing in front of your favorite food truck one day, then post a shot of yourself and your best friend waiting in line at the movies the next day. Try using a selfie stick for full-body or action shots, or shots where you want to capture a lot of the background."
    },
    {
      "title": "Avoid taking pictures in direct sunlight.",
      "content": "Avoid taking pictures in direct sunlight. You'll find yourself squinting in the bright sun, and the light will cast shadows on your face. Instead, stand in a spot that's slightly shaded, then face into the indirect light. If you can't avoid being in the bright sun, you can recreate indirect lighting by facing away from the sun. If you or your photographer has one, have someone hold up a reflector (or even a piece of white posterboard) to bounce the light back onto you, which will help you avoid shadows on your face. Sunrise and sunset are the best times of day to take pictures because the light creates a soft warmth in photos."

    {
      "title": "Include natural scenery in the background of your picture.",
      "content": "Include natural scenery in the background of your picture. One great thing about taking pictures outdoors is that you'll often have plenty of interesting things around that you can include in your shot. Try shooting in front of a picturesque view, for instance, or just sit next to a tree for a simple, natural photo. [30] X Research source Make sure there's nothing in the background that will spoil the natural beauty of your picture, like litter or power lines."

      "title": "Interact with whatever's around you.",
      "content": "Interact with whatever's around you. When you're taking pictures outside, it gives you a unique chance to incorporate the natural world into your shot. Try taking a picture where you're smelling a beautiful flower, for instance, or climb up on a nearby large rock. Remember to always prioritize safety! Never climb over guardrails or other safety barriers for the sake of getting a photo, and always keep an eye on your surroundings, including other people, animals, and traffic."

      "title": "Try big, bold poses to make the most of the space.",
      "content": "Try big, bold poses to make the most of the space. When you're shooting indoors, you might not have a lot of room to move around and experiment with different shots. Outdoors, however, you can run, jump, throw your arms up in the air, and interact with the world around you. Get out and get moving to see what inspires you during your photo shoot! [31] X Research source Take a few shots first in safe poses. That way, you'll know you'll have something to fall back on, and you can be more creative with your posing as the shoot progresses."
