      "content": "Understand the anti-aging benefits of Retin-A. Retin-A is a vitamin A derivative which has been prescribed by dermatologists to combat aging for over 20 years. It started out as a treatment for acne, but patients using Retin-A for this purpose soon discovered that their skin became firmer, smoother and younger-looking as a result of the treatment. Dermatologists then began researching the benefits of Retin-A as an anti-aging treatment. [1] X Research source In addition to decreasing the appearance of wrinkles, it can prevent new ones from forming, fade discoloration and sun damage, reduce the risks of developing skin cancer and improve the skin's texture and elasticity. Currently, Retin-A is the only topical treatment for wrinkles that is FDA approved. It is extremely effective, and doctors and patients alike swear by the results. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Get a prescription for Retin-A.",
      "content": "Get a prescription for Retin-A. Retin-A is the brand name version of the generic drug known as tretinoin. It is available only with a doctor's prescription, so you will need to make an appointment with a dermatologist if you are interested in trying this treatment. [3] X Research source The dermatologist will assess your skin and determine whether Retin-A is a good option for you. If used correctly, it can work effectively on most skin types. However, due to it's drying, irritating qualities, it may not be suitable for people who suffer from skin conditions such as eczema or rosacea. Retin-A is applied topically and comes in both cream and gel forms. It also comes in a variety of strengths: the 0.025% cream is for general skin improvement, the 0.05% cream is designed for reducing wrinkles and fine lines, while the 0.1% used widely for the treatment of acne and blackheads. Your doctor will usually start you off with a weaker strength cream until your skin adjusts to the treatment. Then you can progress on to a stronger cream, if necessary. Retinol is another vitamin-A derivative which is found in many over-the-counter products and big brand beauty creams. It produces similar results to Retin-A treatments, but due to its weaker formula it is not as effective (but will cause less irritation.)"

      "content": "Begin using Retin-A at any age. Retin-A is such an effective treatment, that you will notice a visible improvement in the appearance of wrinkles no matter what age you are when you begin using it. [4] X Research source Starting Retin-A treatments in your forties, fifties and above can have the effect of turning back the clock by plumping out the skin, fading age spots and reducing the appearance of wrinkles. It is never too late to start! However, women in their twenties and thirties can also benefit from using Retin-A, as it boosts collagen production beneath the skin, making it thicker and firmer. As a result, starting Retin-A treatment early in life can prevent deep wrinkles from forming in the first place."

      "title": "Be aware of the costs.",
      "content": "Be aware of the costs. One downside to Retin-A treatments is that the creams themselves can be quite pricey.The cost of Retin-A can vary from $80 to $150 for a month supply. [5] X Research source The cost will depend on the strength of the cream, which ranges from 0.025 to 0.1 percent, and whether you want to go for the brand name Retin-A (amongst others) or for the generic form of the drug, tretinoin. The advantage of going for the brand name version is that these companies have added an emollient moisturizer to the creams, making them less irritating than their generic counterparts. In addition, Retin-A and other brand name versions have more advanced delivery systems, meaning that the active ingredients get absorbed by the skin more efficiently. The use of Retin-A for acne treatment is usually covered under insurance plans. However, many insurance companies will not cover the cost of Retin-A treatment if it is prescribed for cosmetic reasons, such as anti-aging treatment. Despite the high cost, it is important to remember than many commercially available skin care products from high-end brands will cost at least as much, if not more, than the Retin-A creams, and, according to dermatologists, Retin-A cream is more effective at reversing the signs of aging than any commercially available cream on the market."

      "title": "Use Retin-A products at night.",
      "content": "Use Retin-A products at night. Retin-A products are typically applied at night, as the vitamin-A compounds they contain are photosensitive and will make your skin much more sensitive to sunlight. Applying the product at night also gives it a chance to absorb into the skin fully. [6] X Research source If you do decide to apply Retin-A products during the daytime, make sure you apply a sunblock afterward and keep out of direct sunlight as much as possible. Also double-check that your chosen product won't break down when exposed to sunlight; while most newer formulas stay intact, many older formulas do not. [7] X Research source When you begin Retin-A treatment, your doctor will probably recommend that you only apply it every two to three nights. This will give your skin a chance to adjust to the cream and help to avoid irritation. Once your skin has adjusted, you can build up to using it every night. Apply the Retin-A to dry skin, about 20 minutes after thoroughly cleansing your face."

      "content": "Use Retin-A sparingly . Retin-A is a very strong treatment, so it imperative that you use it correctly and only apply it in very small amounts. [8] X Research source [9] X Expert Source Kaveri Karhade, MD Board Certified Dermatologist Expert Interview. 11 January 2021. At most, a pea-sized amount of cream should be used on the face, and a little more if applying to the neck. A good technique is to dab the cream on the areas most affected by wrinkles, age spots, etc., then wipe any remaining cream over the rest of the face. Many people become scared of using Retin-A because they start applying the cream too heavily and experience negative side effects such as dryness, irritation, stinging and acne outbreaks. However, these effects can be greatly reduced if the cream is applied in moderation."

      "content": "Always use in combination with moisturizer. Due to the drying effects of Retin-A treatments, it is imperative that you always wear a hydrating moisturizer, day and night. [10] X Research source [11] X Expert Source Kaveri Karhade, MD Board Certified Dermatologist Expert Interview. 11 January 2021. At night, wait 20 minutes for the Retin-A to be fully absorbed into the skin, then apply your moisturizer. In the morning, wash your face thoroughly before applying a second moisturizer containing a high SPF. Sometimes, it can be hard to spread the recommended pea-sized amount of Retin-A to all of the areas of the face where it's needed. A good solution to this problem is to mix the Retin-A with your nightly moisturizer before applying it to the face. This way, the Retin-A will be dispersed evenly all over the face. Due to the diluting effects of the moisturizer it should also be less irritating. If your skin starts to feel really dry and your regular moisturizer doesn't seem to be enough, try rubbing some extra virgin olive oil into your skin before bed. The oil contains fatty acids which are extremely moisturizing for your skin, in addition to being very gentle."

      "content": "Deal with any sensitivity or irritation. Most people will experience some dryness and irritation after beginning Retin-A treatments, and a small number will experience acne breakouts. Don't worry, as these reactions are completely normal. As long as you are using the treatment correctly, any irritation should subside within a few weeks. [12] X Research source Things that will lessen irritation include making sure that you gradually build up to using the cream every night, using only the recommended pea-sized amount, and moisturizing frequently. You should also be sure to use a very mild, non-irritating cleanser when washing your face. Choose something very natural, with no added colors or fragrance. Also try to use a gentle face scrub once a week to slough off any dead skin. If your skin becomes very irritated and sensitive, cut back on the Retin-A applications or stop using it altogether until your skin has recovered slightly. Then, you can slowly build back up to using it again. It will take some skin types longer to adjust the Retin-A than others."

[13] X Research source Some people will see improvement in as little as one week, whereas for others it might take as long as eight weeks. Don't give up however - Retin-A has produced proven positive results and is possibly the most effective anti-wrinkle cream available. Beyond Retin-A, the only more effective thing you can do to combat wrinkles is to get Botox or Dysport treatments, injectable fillers, or to consider surgical options."
