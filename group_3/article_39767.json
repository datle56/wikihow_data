      "content": "Choose the right place. There are many places where sitting next to a girl that you like can be a great way to introduce yourself or get to know her further.

      "content": "Choose the right time. Timing is everything when talking to someone you have a crush on. You don’t want them to see you as a nuisance or an interruption. If the girl you like seems busy doing homework or talking to someone on her cellphone, this may not be the best time to approach her. [2] X Research source Before or after class is a good time. Choose a seat next to her during study hall."

    {
      "title": "Ask if you can sit down.",
      "content": "Ask if you can sit down. Show that you are courteous and thoughtful by asking her if you can sit next to her. You also want to make sure no one else has that seat claimed, like maybe a friend of hers, before you just jump into it. “Is someone already sitting in this seat?” “Do you mind if I sit here?” If it turns out she was busy, apologize for interrupting."

      "title": "Respect her wishes if she says no.",
      "content": "Respect her wishes if she says no. No woman is under any obligation to talk to you. Also, if she says this isn’t a good time or that she would rather sit alone, you’ll go further toward earning her respect by be being mindful of her wishes. Say something like, “Oh, okay. Maybe another time.” And then walk away graciously. Don’t sit down anyway if she says no. Realize that your crush may just be having a bad day or might be trying to focus on other things. Just because she said no today doesn't mean she'll say no next time."

      "content": "Don’t sit too close. When you sit next to your crush, be sure not to intrude on their personal space. [3] X Expert Source Eddy Baller Dating Coach Expert Interview. 7 February 2020. You want to be close enough so that you can easily carry on a conversation but not so close that your knees touch when you turn to face her. When choosing the desk next to your crush in class, don’t pull it closer to hers. She may find this to be an overly aggressive gesture. If you strike up a conversation and feel like the desks are too far apart to continue comfortably, you may want to slide it over a bit, but generally you should just leave it where it is. If you take a seat next to her on a bench, like on the playground or at a table in the lunch room, leave several inches between you."

      "title": "Don’t fidget.",
      "content": "Don’t fidget. Tapping your fingers on the desk, shaking your legs, or constantly readjusting your glasses will just make you look nervous. It will also act as a distraction for your crush which will make it hard for her to focus on what you have to say. Take deep breaths. Fold your hands and rest them on the desk or table in front of you. If there is no table, rest them in your lap. You don’t have to keep your hands still the whole time. Many of us use our hands to gesture while we speak, but when they are idle, keeping them folded will help keep you from fidgeting too much. Take a quick inventory of your body every few minutes. Maybe while she is talking or when there is a small break in the conversation. Check in with yourself. If you feel your leg bouncing or an urge to keep moving around in your seat, take a deep breath and try to relax. Bring your focus back to your crush."

You can ease some of the stress by having a few things already picked out to talk about before you sit down.

If you are at lunch or out with friends you might mention a popular movie or the antics of a friend you have in common. “Professor Fink is so boring. I actually like physics, but he has a real knack for sucking all the fun out of it.” “Have you seen the latest episode of Supernatural? It was riveting.” “Today is my dog’s birthday. I’m so excited.

You can try redirecting the topic to something more neutral or inline with her interests. This may also be a sign that she needs more space or is feeling somehow intruded on.

If you notice her leaning forward, smiling, and/or making eye contact, then this is a good indicator that she is engaged in the conversation and having a good time. Keep it up!
