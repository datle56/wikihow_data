You may need to look around or check your user's manual/online documentation to find the Port Forwarding settings in your router's user interface. Use the default gateway address for your router to access your router's user interface on PC or Mac. For example, if you wanted to find the port forwarding section on a Linksys router, you would search for linksys port forwarding and look for your router's model number from there. Be prepared to think outside the box when looking for router page items; for example, if you don't see \"Advanced\" listed somewhere on your router's page, keep looking—don't just give up there."

This isn't usually required, but it will help you keep track of your various port forwarding rules. Type or Service Type — This can be TCP, UDP, or both. If you aren't sure of which one to use, select Both or TCP/UDP . Inbound or Start — The first port number goes here. You should research your selected port number to make sure it isn't already taken by a specific application. Private or End — The second port number goes here. If you only want to open one port, enter the same port number here; if you wish to open a range of ports, type the number of the port at the end of the range into this text field (e.g., entering \"3570\" in the first field and \"3580\" in the second field would open ports 3570 through 3580)."
