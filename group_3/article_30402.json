Ignoring friends, partners or kids."

    {
      "title": "Limit exposure.",
      "content": "Limit exposure. Change your physical or social media surroundings to focus less on your hyperfixation. This can be done by removing reminders of the interest from your room or unfollowing accounts to do with it on social media."
    },
    {
      "title": "Wait it out.",
      "content": "Wait it out. Give yourself time to get over your hyperfixation. It most likely won't last forever, and if you just give yourself the time you need to focus on it, you can move past it. This is generally how hyperfixations tend to pass. It may mean that you have to spend a lot of time occupied by your interest, however it may be the only feasible option."
    },
    {
      "title": "Seek support.",
      "content": "Seek support. If your hyperfixation is causing adverse effects on your daily functioning and well-being, you might need to seek professional support. External guidance can provide perspective as you transition away from the interest. Support groups or online communities that manage hyperfixations can offer support and understanding on a deeper level. They may be able to provide tips from personal experience that can help you move on. Talking therapy such as CBT [3] X Research source may help you to change your patterns by working on the roots of the behaviours and changing them over time."
