      "title": "Washing daily eliminates smelly bacteria on your skin.",
      "content": "Washing daily eliminates smelly bacteria on your skin. Sweat itself does not smell; body odor is caused when bacteria on your skin breaks your sweat down into acids. While bacteria are a normal part of your body's make-up, a quick shower removes any excess bacteria and the acids they produce. Pay special attention to cleansing hairy areas of the body. Humans have two types of sweat glands. Eccrine glands are spread across your skin and regulate your body temperature by cooling your skin with sweat when you get hot. The sweat produced by this gland is typically less smelly. Apocrine glands, on the other hand, are concentrated in hairy areas of your body such as armpits and your genital region. The sweat from these glands contains high levels of protein. Your skin bacteria love protein, so this type of sweat quickly becomes very stinky!

Again, some bacteria are good — but too many can pose a problem, especially in odor-prone areas like your armpits.

      "content": "Switch between a few pairs so they can dry out between wearing them. Socks should be thick, soft, and made of natural fibers, or sports socks designed to absorb moisture. Shoes should be made of leather, canvas, or mesh rather than synthetic materials. Change your socks at least twice a day if you are prone to sweaty feet. Carry a spare pair of socks with you so you can change them whenever you need to. Use an antiperspirant made for feet to reduce sweating. Sprinkle a shoe powder in them to absorb odors after each use and thoroughly clean them on a regular basis."

      "title": "Some products mask smells, while others eliminate the cause of sweat.",
      "content": "Some products mask smells, while others eliminate the cause of sweat. Deodorant uses perfume to mask the smell of sweat without eliminating the sweat itself. Antiperspirant reduces the amount of sweat the body produces. The active ingredient in antiperspirant is usually aluminum chloride, which blocks your glands from producing sweat. Use a paper towel to apply it so you don't get bacteria on the roller. If regular antiperspirant fails to keep you from sweating, consult your doctor about special formulations containing extra aluminum chloride. These antiperspirants are usually applied overnight and washed off in the morning. They operate by using the hours you are sleeping (you sweat less while you sleep) to seep into sweat glands and block the production of sweat.

      "content": "Only spray one to two sprays total to prevent overwhelming people. While perfumes are no substitute for good hygiene, they replace problematic smells with an appealing scent. Experiment to find a fragrance that interacts well with your body chemistry. Keep your chosen perfume or body spray handy to refresh your scent during the day. Be aware of any regulations regarding scents in your workplace or school. Some people are very sensitive to artificial fragrances, and you may not be permitted to wear them in certain settings. Moisture-reactive perfume is not yet on the market, but it may prove a useful tool in the future. Scientists in Ireland have learned how to bond fragrance to ionic liquids that react to water — including the water in sweat. The more someone wearing such a substance sweats, the stronger the scent becomes. [6] X Research source"

While this tactic will not change your sweat volume, by protecting your clothing you'll be able to wear shirts and sweaters longer before they become smelly. Shields are generally made from absorbent material that will keep sweat from clinging to your skin and becoming smelly. You will also minimize the appearance of your sweat.

Removing a small area of skin from a patient's armpit and the tissue just below the armpit will often eliminate the most troublesome apocrine sweat glands. Sweat glands can sometimes be drawn out from deeper skin layers using liposuction."
