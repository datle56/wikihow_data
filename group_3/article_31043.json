      "title": "HDMI is the most common monitor connection type.",
      "content": "HDMI is the most common monitor connection type. They are used on both high-definition televisions and computer monitors. HDMI cables are capable of delivering HD and 4K video with high frame rates as well as multi-channel surround sound audio through a single cable. A standard HDMI port resembles a 1.4 cm (0.55 in) thin rectangle with the bottom corners cut out. There are also smaller HDMI-mini and HDMI-mico ports which look similar, but smaller. They are extremely easy to use as connecting your device is as simple as plugging one end of the cable into your device and the other into your monitor or television. The standard for HDMI has changed over the years, which created different versions of HDMI. It’s important to check the packaging when purchasing an HDMI cable to see what version it supports and what its capabilities are. Each version is backward compatible with previous versions. [1] X Research source HDMI 1.0 and 1.2 are capable of supporting standard HD 1080p (1900 x 1080) at 60 Hz or 60 frames per second as well as 8-channel surround sound audio. HDMI 1.4 was the first standard to support 4K (3840 × 2160) video at 30 frames per second. It was also the first standard to support Audio Return Channel (ARC) which allows you to control your audio equipment using your TV remote. Additionally, it supports 3D video, Dolby TrueHD, and DTS-HD. HDMI 2.0 is capable of supporting 4K video at 60 frames per second. It is also the first standard to support High Dynamic Range (HDR) color. Additionally, it supports 32-channel audio. HDMI 2.1 supports 4K video at 120 frames per second, or 8K and 60 frames per second. Additionally, HDMI 2.1 is the first to support Enhanced Audio Return Channel, or eARC, which supports higher-quality surround sound."

      "title": "DisplayPort is the professional standard for computer monitors.",
      "content": "DisplayPort is the professional standard for computer monitors. Like HDMI, DisplayPort is a digital format that supports high-resolution video and audio through a single cable. DisplayPort is most commonly used with computer monitors, whereas HDMI is used on both television and computer monitors. DisplayPort tends to have a higher bandwidth than HDMI and supports higher resolutions and faster frame rates. A standard DisplayPort port resembles a 1.6 cm (0.63 in) rectangle with the bottom right corner cut out. There are also Mini-DisplayPorts that resemble a Thunderbolt 1 port. DisplayPort cables can be used to daisy chain multiple monitors together in a row, allowing you to connect 2 to 4 monitors, depending on what version of DisplayPort you are using. Like HDMI, the DisplayPort format has gone through many improvements over the years, which has produced different versions of DisplayPort with different capabilities. It is important to check the packaging to see what version your DisplayPort cable is and what it is capable of. [2] X Research source [3] X Research source DisplayPort 1.0 supports HD 1080p video at 144 frames per second, or 4k video at 30 frames per second. DisplayPort 1.0 only supports one connected monitor. DisplayPort 1.2 supports one monitor at 4K video at 60 frames per second. It also supports variable refresh rate, G-Sync, and Free-sync. DisplayPort 1.2 can support 2 monitors at 2560 x 1600 at 60 frames per second, or 4 monitors at 1920 x 1200 at 60 frames per second. DisplayPort 1.4 supports 8K at 60 frames per second, or 4K at 120 frames per second. It is also the first version to support High Dynamic Range (HDR) color. It can support 2 monitors at 8K 60 Hz. DisplayPort 2.0 can support up to 16K at 60 frames per second with HDR, or 8K at 120 frames per second with HDR. It can support up to 3 monitors at 4K at 90 frames per second, or 2 monitors at 4K at 144 frames per second. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "USB is one of the most versatile connection types. You’re probably familiar with USB cables. It’s used to connect all your devices and accessories to your computer as well as charge and power your devices. However, it can also be used as a monitor connection. USB 3.1 is capable of delivering HD 1080p video over a USB-A, USB-Mini, or USB-C connection. USB 4 can deliver 4K video over a USB-C connection. It also supports DisplayPort 2.0 alt mode, meaning you can use a USB 4.0 cable as a DisplayPort cable."

      "title": "DVI is a legacy digital video connection type.",
      "content": "DVI is a legacy digital video connection type. It’s most often used in older computers but you may still see it around occasionally. . [5] X Research source DVI cables have a male connector that has 24 pins and a small flat prong (sometimes with 4 additional pins around the prong). The port has 24 holes, the pins and a slot for the prong. There are also two screw holes to secure the connector. Single-link DVI cables are capable of delivering digital resolutions up to 1080p at 60 frames per second. Dual-link DVI cables are capable of delivering a 2048 x 1536 resolution at 60 frames per second. DVI-D cables are only capable of delivering digital video signals. DVI-I cables are capable of both analog and digital videos. Unlike, HDMI, DisplayPort, or USB, DVI cables do not transmit audio. A separate audio connection is required"

      "title": "VGA is a legacy analog computer monitor connection type.",
      "content": "VGA is a legacy analog computer monitor connection type. VGA was originally introduced in 1987 by IBM. It delivers analog video to a computer monitor. They are typically used on older CRT monitors. [6] X Research source [7] X Research source VGA cables have a male port with 15 pins. The female port has 15 holes for the pins. Like DVI cables, they have two screws that secure the connection. Like other video connections, VGA went through various versions that improved the resolution and graphics. VGA originally supported a resolution of 640 x 480 at 4-bit graphics (16 colors). Super VGA (SVGA) extended the resolution to 800 x 600 and added support for 8-bit graphics (256 colors). Extended Graphics Array (XGA) expanded the resolution to 1024 x 786. Certain high-end monitors still exist that support the Graphics Array format at high resolutions. Wide Ultra Extended Graphics Array (WUXGA) supports a resolution of 1920x1200. Wide Quad Extended Graphics Array (WQUXGA) can support a resolution of 3840x2400. [8] X Research source Much like the DVI format, VGA and other graphics array formats do not support audio. A separate audio connectio is required."

      "title": "S-video (separate video) delivers high-quality standard-definition video.",
      "content": "S-video (separate video) delivers high-quality standard-definition video. This is another legacy connection type most commonly used on analog televisions, such as old CRT televisions. [10] X Research source S-Video cables have a male port that has 4 pins and a metal prong. S-Video cables separate the video signal into two separate signals for the color and brightness. Together, this delivers a cleaner and sharper image. S-Video is not capable of transmitting audio. A separate audio connection is required."

      "title": "Composite cables are the most common cable for standard definition.",
      "content": "Composite cables are the most common cable for standard definition. Composite cables have been around since the 50s and are most commonly used on old analog televisions. Composite cables are only capable of delivering analog signals at standard definition. They can deliver stereo audio with separate composite cables for the audio channels. Composite cables usually contain 3 color-coded cables bundled into one. They usually contain a yellow cable for the video single and a red and white cable for the left and right audio signals. Unlike S-video cables, composite cables combine the color and brightness signals into one. This leads to a lower image quality."

      "title": "Coaxial (coax) cables transmit high-frequency signals over long distances.",
      "content": "Coaxial (coax) cables transmit high-frequency signals over long distances. Coaxial cables have been the standard for cable companies for years. They can also be used to deliver audio and video signals to a television. Coaxial cables are very versatile. [11] X Research source Many older TVs have a coaxial input on the TV. The coaxial connector usually has a single pin and threaded metal connector that screws on over the port. Coaxial cable can be used to deliver analog and digital signals as well as video and audio signals. High-quality coaxial cables (i.e. RG-6) can deliver 4K video (though they are rarely connected directly to a 4K monitor)."
