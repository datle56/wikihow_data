Many trend experts, publications, and social media users have pointed out the strange co-occurrence of the rise in this money-based trend alongside prevalent social issues such as a widening wealth gap, ever-increasing inflation, and an unchanging minimum wage. [16] X Research source However, it’s possible that people in the middle and lower classes use this trend to provide a sense of validation and inclusion during a time when access to elite groups and wealth classes is increasingly unattainable. [17] X Research source Plus, the “look” of wealth (and how it shows up in fashion) has always evolved based on pop culture and current political ideologies, so it may make perfect sense that the idea of “quiet” luxury (rather than flashy brands) has gained traction in a time where flaunting wealth may appear cruel or out-of-touch. Looking to pop culture, HBO’s Succession , for instance, has been credited with some of the popularity for the “stealth wealth” trend. Consumers have historically looked to the screen for what to wear and how to behave, so it’s no wonder that the old money fashion from the show has infiltrated the real world. [18] X Research source"
