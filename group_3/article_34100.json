If you can, start assembling your puzzle on wax paper to avoid any difficulty with this step. If you’ve already completed it though, that’s no problem. Slide the paper under your puzzle so that there is a paper border around your puzzle: at least 2 inches (5.1 cm) on all sides. [1] X Research source Carefully lift one corner of your puzzle and slide the paper under it. Continue to move the puzzle over the paper until the puzzle sits completely on wax paper. Depending on the size of your puzzle, you may need to use multiple sheets of wax paper. If you do, overlap them under your puzzle so no glue can leak through. [2] X Research source"

Don’t leave excess glue unspread on the surface of pieces. [5] X Research source Coat the edges of the puzzle as well. [6] X Research source It is okay if some glue goes onto the wax paper, but a large amount in this area may make the puzzle stick to the wax paper, so quickly wipe it away with a wet paper towel, doing your best to avoid touching the rest of the puzzle.

There are two ways you can figure out how to cut the board to the right size: Use a tape measure to determine the length and width of the puzzle, and then use the tape measure to mark those dimensions on the backing.
