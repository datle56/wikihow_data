      "content": "Grab a bite to eat so there's something in your stomach other than caffeine. Although more research is needed, some people find that eating a protein-rich snack or meal really helps counteract caffeine jitters. Munch on a handful of nuts or make an easy meal of eggs and whole-grain toast, for instance. [1] X Research source Other great sources of protein include hummus, nut butter, deli meat, avocados, and Greek yogurt. You might notice that the effects of caffeine are worse if you consume it on an empty stomach so any snack is better than none."

      "content": "Focused breathing exercises can reduce anxiety. If you're feeling nervous and your heart is racing, you might feel panicked. Calm your mind and help slow your body by taking deep breaths, meditating, or doing yoga. After a few minutes, you should feel a little more relaxed and comfortable as your body continues to break down the caffeine. [2] X Research source For a simple deep breathing technique, sit comfortably and close your eyes. Breathe in through your nose to the count of 4, then hold it for 4 counts. Breathe out to the count of 4 and hold it for 4 beats before inhaling again. Repeat the process until you feel yourself calming down."

If you don't have a lot of space or can't get out, do a few stretches.

      "title": "Take this supplement if you usually have anxiety.",
      "content": "Take this supplement if you usually have anxiety. L-theanine is an amino acid that you can buy in supplement form. Studies have shown that if you take L-theanine with caffeine, the L-theanine can decrease the jittery or anxiety-inducing effects of the caffeine. To take it, swallow a single 100 to 200-mg pill or stir dissolve a 100 to 200-mg packet in your coffee or energy drink. It's fine to take L-theanine without your coffee, but you'll probably prevent jitters if you take it when you consume the caffeine. Check your local health food store, pharmacy, or supplement aisle at the grocery store for L-theanine supplements. You can also get L-theanine naturally from tea, but tea contains caffeine which you probably want to avoid."

      "content": "You'll probably notice the effects for about 3 to 5 hours. Caffeine works pretty quickly once you consume it—you probably notice its effects within 15 minutes and it peaks about 1 hour later. While you can try strategies to flush the caffeine out of your system, it will work its way out of your bloodstream within 10 hours on its own [7] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Around half of the caffeine is usually out of your system 6 hours after you consume it."

      "content": "Give yourself a caffeine cut-off time if you struggle to fall asleep. It's really hard to calm down and turn your mind off if you have caffeine in your system. To make it easier to fall asleep, try stop drinking caffeine by early afternoon—some say around 2pm. This gives your body a lot of time to metabolize the caffeine so you're not alert as you try to get rest. [8] X Research source Even though you're cutting off your caffeine intake, don't overdo how much you drink! Limit your daily caffeine consumption to around 300 or 400 mg. That's about 3 to 4 8 fl oz (240 mL) cups of brewed coffee."

If you notice that even a little caffeine keeps you too alert, awake, or jittery, start drinking decaf. To make the transition smooth, alternate between drinking decaf and regular coffee. Then, start drinking decaf more often. [9] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Are you an energy drinker?
