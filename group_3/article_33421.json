      "title": "Do the tutorial.",
      "content": "Do the tutorial. Your run begins right at the very start of the game. Evil monkeys are after you so you better keep running! The objective of the game is to run away from the evil monkeys while avoiding obstacles along the way. There will be a short tutorial at the early start of your run so don’t worry. The tutorial will teach you how to jump across gaps. This can be done by swiping your finger upwards across the screen. To turn to either left or right, you just have to swipe the screen on the direction you want to turn. You can also slide by swiping your screen downwards. This move is useful in going through low pathways. You can also tilt your device so your runner can move either to the left, right, or center part of the way."

      "title": "Try again.",
      "content": "Try again. Since this game is primarily a game of collecting distance – it is safe to say that it does not have an ending. You will just keep on running and soon enough find yourself falling or bumping into a tree trunk. In short - it is game over. The game over screen gives you a couple of options. You can post your stats online via Twitter or Facebook. Access your Upgrades page and use your resources to improve your runner’s skills. You can adjust certain settings via Menu. You can also simply choose to pick yourself up and try again."

Instead of running, you will be riding a mining cart that explores a mine tunnel! This part alters a few commands on how you control your runner. Swiping down now makes your runner duck instead of sliding. Tilting your device changes the lane of the mining cart. There will be no command for jumping while inside the mines."

It attracts coins for you so don’t have to approach the coins yourself. The Boost. The boost is a power-up which lets the runner dash really fast! You can go through any hazard including gaps.
