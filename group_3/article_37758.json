This is most likely the look you think of when you consider turtlenecks. When you put it on, the neck will probably extend up to your chin or even over your mouth.

[2] X Research source Folding the neck gives your turtleneck a crisp, defined outline that makes it look more polished than if you scrunch the neck."

      "content": "Roll the neck over twice to make a shorter neckline. If you feel like your turtleneck is strangling you or it feels like it's too high on your neck, fold the neck down twice so the top folded edge meets your collar.

      "content": "Scrunch the neck instead of rolling it down if you want a soft, loose look. Some people argue that you should always fold your turtleneck down, but you might prefer leaving the neck extended. Bunch the fabric around your neck so it doesn't reach above your jawline. [4] X Research source This works best with lightweight turtlenecks or cowl turtlenecks that have a lot of loose, flowing fabric around the neck. Bunching heavy turtlenecks can add too much weight to your neck."

      "content": "Wear a thick, chunky turtleneck with corduroy pants for a warm style. Soft, bulky turtlenecks are perfect for cold temperatures since they really trap heat. However, since they are so big, plan on wearing them without other layers. It's totally fine to toss on a winter coat, but go for a peacoat or wool coat instead of a puffy coat, which could make you look too bulky."
