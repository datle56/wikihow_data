Hold your sunglasses in the other hand and gently rub the detergent all over the frames to clean them. [3] X Research source Make sure to get in the crevices where the frames meet the lenses.

Inspect the sunglasses closely to make sure there is no soap left on them before you proceed to dry them.

      "content": "Dry the sunglasses with a clean, dry microfiber cloth. Gently shake the sunglasses to remove any large droplets of water. Wipe the sunglasses completely dry with a microfiber cloth, like the cloth for cleaning the lenses that often comes with a pair of sunglasses. [5] X Trustworthy Source Consumer Reports Nonprofit organization dedicated to consumer advocacy and product testing Go to source If you don’t have a microfiber cloth, you can use a lint-free cotton cloth or towel. Make sure it has not been laundered with fabric softener or dryer sheets, which can leave smears on your sunglasses. You can get replacement microfiber cloths for cleaning your sunglasses at a store that sells glasses or a photography supply shop. If your sunglasses have metal frames, cleaning them with soap and water and drying them off with a microfiber cloth will restore their shine and get rid of minor oxidation marks."

      "content": "Clean your sunglasses with dish detergent and water before polishing them. Use liquid dish detergent and warm water to clean dirt and debris off the frames, then dry the frames completely with a microfiber cloth. This is important to get rid of any dirt or grit that might scratch the frames as you attempt to polish them. [6] X Research source If your frames are metal, cleaning them with the above technique is the best way to restore their shine. If you require further polishing, you can get them professionally polished. Don’t try to polish them using the following nail buffer method."

      "content": "Use a 4-stage nail buffer to remove oxidation and minor scuffs. A 4-stage nail buffer is a small handheld block made for filing and polishing nails that has 4 sides of varying grits, called stages or steps. Purchase such a nail buffer to use for restoring shine to your plastic glasses frames at a pharmacy, beauty supply shop, or online. [7] X Research source This method works to get rid of white oxidation marks and very minor scuff marks from any type of plastic sunglasses frames, including acetate frames. If there are any deep scratches or more serious damage to the frames, your best bet is to get new frames."

Stage 3 is the side meant for smoothing out nails and will get rid of oxidation and minor scuffs on your frames. Rub the frames all over in back and forth motions, being very careful not to touch the lenses, until you remove all oxidation and minor scuffs. [8] X Research source Don’t ever use stages 1 or 2 of the nail buffer because these are meant for filing and will scratch your frames."

Stage 4 is the side made for polishing nails, so it will restore the shine to your frames after you buff off oxidation and scuffs. Rub the stage 4 side of the nail buffer back and forth over all parts of the frames without touching the lenses until the frames look evenly shiny. [9] X Research source If you can’t get the nail buffer into all areas of the frames, such as areas near the lenses, use a microfiber cloth to rub these areas and shine them up as much as you can. Don’t risk scratching the lenses."

Lanolin is a type of wax that is typically used to protect and treat dry skin, but also works to restore shine to plastic sunglasses frames. Dip a fingertip in a tin of lanolin, then lightly rub the lanolin all over the frames until they look uniformly shiny. [10] X Research source If you get any lanolin on the lenses, immediately wipe it off with a clean, lint-free cloth. Lanolin can damage some types of lens coatings. [11] X Research source"
