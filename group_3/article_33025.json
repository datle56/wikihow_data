      "title": "Form a team of two players.",
      "content": "Form a team of two players. Each team consists of only two players. Professional beach volleyball does not allow for substitutions. If one player is unable to play, then the team must forfeit the match."

      "title": "Play using the correct equipment.",
      "content": "Play using the correct equipment. Beach volleyball is played on a rectangular court and is divided evenly into two parts by the center line and net. For professional or Olympic beach volleyball, the court must measure 16 x 8 meters and the net must be at height of 2.43 meters for men and 2.24 meters for women. Many local public beach areas will have nets set up for impromptu volleyball games. Depending on your area, court time can be reserved through the local Parks and Recreation Department. Sand courts can also be found at parks and other recreation areas. Using a search engine to search for “sand volleyball courts” in your area should show some courts that are near you."

      "title": "Do not let the ball hit the ground.",
      "content": "Do not let the ball hit the ground. The objective in volleyball is to make the ball hit the sand on the opposing team’s side of the court while simultaneously preventing the ball from hitting the sand on your team’s side of the court. This can be difficult to do and many players will go to great lengths to be able to keep the ball from falling."

    {
      "title": "Hit the ball only three times per side.",
      "content": "Hit the ball only three times per side. In beach volleyball, each team is only allowed three contacts with the ball before it must go back over net. Players are permitted to block the serve as it comes over the net, as long as they do not come into physical contact with the net. The ideal sequence is a dig (a pass in which the forearms are used as a platform to direct the ball), then a set (passing the ball over the head with your hands), then an attack, where the ball is directed over the net to the opponent’s side."

    {
      "title": "Do not hit the ball two times in succession.",
      "content": "Do not hit the ball two times in succession. Each player is only allowed to hit the ball one time before the other player must hit it or the ball drops."
    },
    {
      "title": "Do not let the ball come to a rest.",
      "content": "Do not let the ball come to a rest. The ball must be in motion at all times until it hits the sand. In other words, the player cannot hold or carry the volleyball for any length of time during the rally. Doing so will earn the opposing team a point, as if the ball had hit the ground."
    },
    {
      "title": "Pass the ball.",
      "content": "Pass the ball. There are two ways of passing the ball in volleyball: the forearm pass and the overhand pass. A pass is a method of receiving the ball from the other team. In order to execute the pass, the player uses their hands or forearms to direct the ball. For a forearm pass, the player receives the ball with their forearms and then directs it by clasping their hands and joining their forearms together to form a platform. The overhand pass is executed by directing the ball with your hands over the head. This movement must be quick and precise."
    },
    {
      "title": "Set the ball.",
      "content": "Set the ball. Setting the ball involves hitting the ball into the air so that it is in a position for you or your teammate to execute an overhand attack or hit. This movement is generally carried out in the same manner as the overhand pass. The player directs the ball with their hands over their head."
    },
    {
      "title": "Block the ball.",
      "content": "Block the ball. Blocking the ball involves halting the ball from coming over the net by jumping with your hands overhead and hitting the ball back to your opponent’s side. When blocking the ball, be very wary of the net. Touching the net is a violation in beach volleyball."
    },
    {
      "title": "Hit the ball.",
      "content": "Hit the ball. Hitting the ball is the player’s way of getting the ball to hit the sand on the opposing team’s side of the court. This is generally executed with a jump to increase the intensity of the hit, which can increase the difficulty of the other team being able to return the ball."

    {
      "title": "Play three games to win a match.",
      "content": "Play three games to win a match. There are three games in every match. A team must win two of those games in order to win the match. The first team to reach 21 points wins the game but they must be leading by at least two points. The third game is only played to 15 points and must also be won by a two point advantage."
    },
    {
      "title": "Use a rally point system for scoring.",
      "content": "Use a rally point system for scoring. When the play stops at the end of each rally, a point is earned. A rally is the number of hits between the two teams. Whichever team wins the rally will also win the next serve. [1] X Research source When the opposing team serves the ball and then wins the rally, it scores one point and serves again. When the opposing team receives the serve and wins the rally, it scores a point and wins the right to serve."
    },
    {
      "title": "Switch sides of the court.",
      "content": "Switch sides of the court. After every seven points in the first and second set (also known as a game), and every five points in the third set, switch sides of the court with the opposing team. This will require each team to play in the same weather conditions, which can be more favorable on one side of the net, depending on where the sun is shining or which way the wind is blowing."
