[1] X Research source Dip a clean washcloth into the water and gently blot the stain. If nothing happens, try alternating between blotting and wiping until the stain disappears. Blot the area dry with clean paper towels, then wash the jeans with cold water and a mild detergent. If the stain is very fresh, try using club soda instead of water. It may help to turn the jeans inside out and flush the stain from the back. Alternatively, dampen the stain with cold water, then sprinkle the salt onto the stain. Use an old toothbrush to scrub the salt into the fabric, then rinse the jeans with cold water and wash them as usual. If this doesn’t work, pour undiluted white vinegar on the spot, let it soak for 10 minutes, then blot the stain with paper towels. Wash your jeans on a cold setting with mild detergent and hang them to dry."

Once they’re dry, put them in your regular laundry cycle. [3] X Research source This method works well on old and set-in stains. Note that lemon juice can lighten your garment's color.

      "content": "Blot fresh stains with a dry paper towel. When a stain is fresh, your first instinct may be to wipe it with water, but this will only set the stain further as oil repels water. Instead, try to soak up excess oil with a dry paper towel. If the stain is big or deep-set or the paper towel doesn’t fully absorb the stain, try one of the steps below to remove it completely. [6] X Research source Gorgis says, “Butter and/or oil stains both leave a greasy texture on clothing. One should first use a dry paper towel to wipe away as much of the stains as possible. You can use mild dish soap and warm water to wash the stain in the sink and then place the item in the washer with warm water and regular laundry detergent.”"

If it’s being stubborn, pour a drop or two of mild dish detergent onto it and continue scrubbing with the toothbrush or a clean cloth. Let it sit for 10 minutes, then wash the jeans on a normal cycle. [7] X Research source If you don’t have baking soda, dish detergent alone is often enough to remove grease and oil stains. Dab a drop or two onto the stain, add a bit of water, then wipe the stain with a clean cloth until it’s gone. For heavy oil stains, Gorgis recommends letting baking soda “sit for half an hour.”"

Believe it or not, artificial sweeteners, like Splenda or Sweet’N Low, can often soak up oil and grease due to their high absorbency and abrasive texture. Sprinkle the sweetener on the stain and let it sit for several minutes. Then, brush off the remaining powder and dab a bit of dish soap onto the stain. Gently rub it in, then rinse the jeans with warm water and launder them as you normally would. [9] X Research source Artificial sweeteners are particularly good when you're out and about.

Let it sit for a few minutes and then drop the item in the wash with warm water and regular laundry detergent.” Gorgis adds, “You can also add vinegar in the wash cycle to ensure that the stain is completely removed and that you do not have to repeat the wash cycle.

Instead of trying to wash the makeup off, try to brush non-liquid makeup off before it seeps into the fabric. A hairdryer works well for powder-based makeup. Be careful, however, as you don’t want to grind the stain deeper into your jeans. [10] X Research source Unless the makeup is powder, this likely won’t be enough to remove the stain completely.
