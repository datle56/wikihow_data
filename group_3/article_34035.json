Techniques that can be successful for studying content include memorization, using acronyms, and using associations. Another type of studying is \"chunking,\" which is breaking a large amount of material down into smaller units instead of trying to absorb everything at once. [3] X Research source Avoid cramming. Make sure you give yourself enough time to study. If you have already worked and volunteered in the field, you will likely already know a lot of the information, but don't use that as an excuse to wait to the last minute to study."

You may get lucky and get some extra points. [7] X Research source You may want to look into strategies for quickly answering multiple choice questions .

Answers with absolute qualifiers like \"always\" or \"never\" are typically not the correct answer; however, relative qualifiers such as \"generally\" or \"sometimes\" are usually found in the correct answer."

Registered nurses (RNs) are expected to complete a two or three year degree, usually after obtaining a bachelor’s degree, are more often employed in hospitals and are expected to take on more important tasks that involve a greater degree of critical thinking and decision making. Licensed Practical Nurses (LPNs), also known as Licensed Vocational Nurses (LVNs), usually obtain a nursing certificate after about a year of nursing education. LPNs are more often employed in long term care facilities, filling administrative roles and overseeing the basics of patient care (changing bedpans, linens, IVs, etc…). [8] X Research source In settings where LPNs and RNs work together, RNs outrank LPNs and undertake more intensive and critical duties.
