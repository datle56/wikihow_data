      "title": "Sagittarians are fiercely independent.",
      "content": "Sagittarians are fiercely independent. She plays by her own rules, beats to her own drum and dislikes the idea of a super predictable relationship. So it’s probably best to avoid double and triple texting her when she hasn’t responded just yet. This free-spirited Sadge needs a bit of space to spread her wings, which means the time you get together will be even more electric. [1] X Research source This doesn’t mean you need to be aloof or someone you’re not. Just be intentional. Send her a text about an album you just listened to that you know she’ll like or respond to her Instagram story with congratulations when she posts about an accomplishment at work."

      "title": "There is nothing a Sagittarius loves more than spontaneity.",
      "content": "There is nothing a Sagittarius loves more than spontaneity. She’s always down for a cross-country road trip or a private tour of an art museum, even if it’s only on a moment’s notice. What matters most is that she sees you can be just as curious about the world as she is. Nothing brings two people closer than experiencing something for the first time together. [2] X Research source Surprise her! If you’re taking her to see her favorite band in concert, don’t give her all the details right away. Make sure she’s free, let her know what time you’re picking her up and leave the rest to her imagination. She’ll appreciate the thought you put in and your attentiveness to her interests. Reader Poll: We asked 470 wikiHow readers which type of invitation would most likely excite a Sagittarius woman, and 55% of them said Going on a spontaneous day trip. [Take Poll]"

      "title": "Her quest for knowledge is unmatched.",
      "content": "Her quest for knowledge is unmatched. Learning never really stops for Sagittarians. You’ll find she asks a lot of questions, but it’s just because she cares. She’s probably either picking up a new instrument, studying niche history or plugging away at her DuoLingo lessons to master a new language. So, naturally, she wants a partner with whom she can discuss fascinating concepts and learn from. [3] X Research source Consider teaching her some traditional family recipes or tell her more about one of your hobbies. Your passion will be what’s most attractive to her."

      "title": "She likes being the life of the party, so let her shine.",
      "content": "She likes being the life of the party, so let her shine. Sagittarians want someone who embraces and celebrates their confidence. You may love getting one-on-one time with this Sadge, but in social settings, she loves working the room. However, in between her telling stories, cracking jokes and meeting new people, your eyes may meet across the room, and you’ll both feel butterflies. [4] X Research source If you’re an introvert, this might be a bit out of your comfort zone. That’s okay. She doesn’t expect you to match her exact energy. Mingle in small groups or ask the host at a dinner party if you can help with preparing anything. Friendliness goes a long way!"

      "title": "She’s going to tell it like it is, so she expects you to do the same.",
      "content": "She’s going to tell it like it is, so she expects you to do the same. If you have strong feelings for her, let her know. She’ll love to hear it, and she’ll respect you for being honest about what you want. Don’t be afraid to be a little romantic either. She swoons hard for poetic language and grand gestures. [5] X Research source Honesty also extends outside of romance. If you disagree with something she says while she’s trying to make an argument, you don’t have to just nod along. Tell her why. (Respectfully, of course.) She’ll admire your ability to express yourself, and teach her something new."

      "content": "Sagittarians don't sweat the small stuff. Not everything has to go according to plan. Sagittarians love change and chaos; they truly thrive when things are up in the air. If your date idea doesn’t go exactly the way you had in mind, improvise. If you prove to her that you can go with the flow, she’ll feel right at home. [6] X Research source Be able to laugh at yourself! Sagittarians are known for being one of the funniest signs in the Zodiac, so she not only wants to know she can laugh with you but also that you can be totally yourself around her."

      "content": "Dinner and a movie won’t cut it every time for a Sagittarius woman. There’s nothing necessarily wrong with this classic date, but resorting to the same old, same old every time might make this Sagittarius feel restless. She wants you to be creative and show her that you put thought into the time you spend together. [7] X Research source Try taking her to the farmer’s market or a picnic in the park on a sunny Saturday afternoon. It doesn’t have to be anything fancy. Just find different ways to spend quality time."

      "title": "Sagittarians like to get a little philosophical.",
      "content": "Sagittarians like to get a little philosophical. In fact, Sagittarians believe intelligence is the sexiest thing in the world. She likes people who develop informed, educated opinions on current events and engage in thought-provoking debates. She wants to know that you’re really absorbing the information she shares with you, instead of forgetting it moments later. [8] X Research source Ask her about her favorite book! Sagittarians are your typical bookworms, and they love any excuse to take a walk down memory lane (their colossal bookshelf). Share your favorite book, and tell her why you love it, especially if there’s a good story attached."

      "title": "Seeming distracted can be a turn-off for Sagittarians.",
      "content": "Seeming distracted can be a turn-off for Sagittarians. It's best to put your phone on silent. When she’s passionate about something, she’ll want to tell you about it. And it might hurt her feelings if she senses you’re distracted. Try being an active listener, and let her know you’re interested in the things she cares about. [9] X Research source Don’t be afraid to ask questions. She’s happy to explain, and she’ll love your curiosity."

      "title": "Sagittarians want to be desired.",
      "content": "Sagittarians want to be desired. Sagittarians usually get a little uncomfortable when talking about their feelings, but they’re expert flirts. When she’s crushing hard on someone, she savors the back and forth teasing. The stolen glances, brushing your hand against her thigh under the dinner table, a steamy goodnight kiss. Keep things exciting! [10] X Research source Passion is super important to her, so allowing tension to build is the key to winning over this Sagittarius woman. Focus on physical touch, which is one of her primary love languages."
