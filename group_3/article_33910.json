      "title": "Choose dried lima beans to store them for up to 6 months.",
      "content": "Choose dried lima beans to store them for up to 6 months. Purchase lima beans either from a bulk bin or in a prepackaged container. Check that the bulk bin is fully covered or that the prepackaged container is intact to ensure that the beans are safe from moisture and insects. Store dried lima beans in an airtight container. Place the container in a cool, dark place where the temperature is below 75 °F (24 °C). [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Spread the lima beans out on a light colored plate or tray. Check for any damaged beans, debris, or small stones. Remove and then discard the damaged beans, stones, or debris if you find any. Using a dark colored plate or tray won’t be effective as damaged beans and debris won’t stand out."

      "title": "Soak dried lima beans in water for at least 8 hours.",
      "content": "Soak dried lima beans in water for at least 8 hours. Place the lima beans in a bowl of water, using a ratio of 1 cup (225 g) of beans to every 2 cups (500 mL) of water. Leave the bowl of lima beans and water in the refrigerator for 8 hours. After 8 hours, drain the water from the beans and rinse them again with fresh water. Soaking the lima beans is necessary because it helps to remove some of the sugars, which makes the beans easier to digest. [2] X Research source The beans need to be soaked in the refrigerator rather than at room temperature because otherwise they will begin to ferment."

      "title": "Simmer 3 cups (750 mL) of water to every 1 cup (225 g) of dried lima beans.",
      "content": "Simmer 3 cups (750 mL) of water to every 1 cup (225 g) of dried lima beans. Bring the water to a boil, and then simmer the beans for 45 minutes in a saucepan. Skim off any excess foam while the lima beans simmer to prevent it from bubbling over. After 45 minutes, the beans will be tender. Don’t add any salt or seasoning during this time as this will make the lima beans tough. You can add seasoning either after the beans have simmered, or when you add them to a dish. Once the lima beans have finished simmering, they are ready to enjoy! You can add them to dishes now."

Simmer the stew for 1 hour. Mix together 2 tbsp (16 g) of whole-wheat flour and 2 cups (500 mL) of soy milk, and stir this through the stew to thicken it. [3] X Research source Although the stew will take approximately 1 hour to cook, check the beans from time to time to see when they turn very soft. This is when the stew will be ready to serve. Store any leftovers in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 5 days. [4] X Research source"
