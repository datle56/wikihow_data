[3] X Research source Combine 1/4 teaspoon salt with one cup of warm water. Stir it well to mix. Avoid swishing the saltwater rinse in your mouth or spitting it out. Gently move your head to move the rinse around your mouth or use your tongue to help move the saline solution around. After rinsing, lean over the sink and open your mouth to let the rinse fall out. Don't spit. Your doctor may also give you chlorhexidine gluconate (Peridex, Periogard) to rinse with. This is a germicidal mouthwash that helps kill bacteria. Try diluting it with water at a 1:1 ratio to avoid any possible negative effects of the chlorhexidine. [4] X Research source"

Using a syringe may help you control the flow of water and allow you to clean your wound more efficiently; however, if not used properly, an irrigator or syringe can dislodge the blood clot forming to heal the tissue. Ask your dentist whether you should use one. Fill the syringe with lukewarm water. You may also use the saltwater solution described above. Aim the tip of the syringe as close as possible to the site of your wound without actually touching it. Flush the site of the wound from any necessary angles to thoroughly clean the wound and prevent infection. Do not push too forcefully â€” expelling a powerful jet of water directly into the socket could be harmful."
