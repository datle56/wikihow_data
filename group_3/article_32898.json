      "title": "Know what to expect.",
      "content": "Know what to expect. Cherries do not grow true to seed, meaning the tree won't be the same variety as its parent. You might get a tree that can't survive your climate or local diseases, or that doesn't bear tasty fruit. But you might get a new and beautiful tree, and either way you'll have fun along the way. If you want better odds, plant a young tree instead. A local nursery can recommend a grafted plant suited to your climate and soil."

      "content": "Choose your cherries. Ideally, find fresh cherries from a local tree or farmer's market in mid to late summer. Early-fruiting varieties are often sterile, while grocery store fruit can work but tends to have a low success rate.

There are two common species of cherry to choose from: Almost all fresh cherries for sale are sweet cherries. These are the best for eating, but most are only hardy in USDA hardiness zones 5–7. Sour cherries tend to be easier to grow, and can survive in zones 3-8 depending on variety. The fresh kind can be hard to track down, so ask around at your farmer's market."

      "title": "Consider planting outdoors in early fall.",
      "content": "Consider planting outdoors in early fall. Cherries need to experience constant damp and cold for 3–5 months in order to germinate . If you get cold winter weather about this long but don't get below -20ºF / -30ºC, you can go the easy route and plant the cherries in fall. If you decide to do this, skip down to the next section. If you don't live in this climate or you prefer a method with a higher success rate, continue to the next step instead. Sweet cherries do best with a couple weeks of warm weather before the cold. Planting in late summer or the very start of fall can accomplish this. However, a \"warm snap\" after the cold weather has started can send some cherries back into dormancy.

      "content": "Keep sweet cherries in warm, moist sphagnum moss for two weeks (optional). Many people skip this step and still see a few cherries sprout, but this should increase the germination rate for most sweet cherries. [5] X Trustworthy Source US National Park Service Agency responsible for the maintenance and promotion of national parks and monuments Go to source Here's how to set up this process, called warm stratification: Buy fresh, sterile milled sphagnum moss. This material fights off mold, which is the biggest risk at this stage. Handle moss with clean gloves to avoid introducing spores. Put the moss in a plastic bag or container and add room temperature water (68ºF / 20ºC). [6] X Research source Let it absorb the water for 8–10 hours, then squeeze out the extra moisture. Pop a few air holes in the lid. If using a plastic bag, leave it slightly open at the top. Add the cherry seeds and leave them there for two weeks at the same temperature. Check after the first day or two to pour out standing water, then weekly to throw out moldy seeds (if any)."

This \"cold stratification\" treatment is very similar to the last step, with a few details changed: You can use sphagnum moss again, but peat moss or a 50/50 mix of peat moss and sand may work best. Vermiculite will work as well. Add enough water to moisten the material without getting it soggy, then add seeds. Place in the refrigerator or other area between 33º and 41ºF (0.5 to 5ºC) (ideally at the top of this range).

      "content": "Keep refrigerated for about 90 days. Most cherries need three months of cold treatment before they're ready to plant, and some prefer five. Check on the seeds every week or so. Pour out standing water if present, and add a little more water if the material is drying out. Check more often toward the end of this period. If the hard seed coats have begun to crack, plant right away or reduce the temperature to 32ºF (0ºC) until you're ready."

      "content": "Choose a spot with good soil. Cherries need plenty of sun and good air circulation. They prefer fertile, sandy soil with excellent drainage and neutral or slightly acidic pH. The young tree needs room for a taproot. If planting in a container, it should be at least 8 inch (20 cm) deep. Cherries are very hard to grow in clay soil. If you want to make a serious attempt, build a raised bed 1 foot (0.3 meters) high."

Either thin out the shortest sprouts or transfer them further apart. Each tree should have 20 ft (6m) of space. Keep in mind that transplanting is best done when trees are dormant, which is during the winter. Transplanting trees when they are actively growing will stress the trees and could kill them. Keep in mind that cherries can grow 25–50 ft (7.6–15.2 m) tall, depending on variety. With pruning, you can keep this to 15 ft (4.6 m) or less."

Take these steps to protect them once they grow into proper trees: Surround young trees with a cylinder of wire fencing to protect against deer. Do this as soon as the trees start to come up. Once a month, look for holes in the trunk leaking ooze or sawdust-like frass. Poke a needle into these holes to kill insects. In spring, wrap trunks with mosquito netting to stop boring insects from laying eggs. In late fall, sink a hardware cloth barrier 2 inches (5cm) down into the soil on all sides to protect against rodents. This barrier should be high enough to protect against a rodent standing on expected snowfall."

      "content": "Protect from strong winter sun. In early fall, whitewash the south side of the tree with white, nontoxic latex paint, diluted with water to a thin consistency.

Generally speaking, sour cherries just need a little pruning to keep the branches symmetric. For sweet cherries, prune back the central leader to promote lateral growth instead."

      "title": "Consider grafting",
      "content": "Consider grafting . Left alone, your cherry tree will often take five or more years to bear fruit, if it can manage it at all. Grafting is a little risky with seed-grown trees, since you don't know the variety, but your local nursery may be able to recommend a fruiting species. You can graft this onto a two-year old tree and have fruit by the third or fourth year if the graft takes."

      "content": "Pollinate the blossoms. The beautiful flowers alone are reason to grow cherry trees. If you'd like to see them replaced with fruit, though, they'll need to be pollinated. For most sweet cherries, this means you'll need a second variety of sweet cherry nearby, blooming at the same time. Honeybees are the most common pollinator for cherries. If you're using pesticides, make sure they don't affect this important species. [13] X Research source"
