      "content": "Purchase a shoulder dolly from your local hardware store. A shoulder dolly will cost you around 20 dollars (14.20 pounds) at a hardware store. These flexible straps will help you distribute the load of your Peloton bike between 2 people. Shoulder dollies are sometimes called \"moving harnesses\" or \"moving straps.\" They consist of 2 harnesses and a long moving strap which stretches between the harnesses."

      "content": "Recruit a second person to help you move your Peloton bike. Having someone help you move your bike is a good idea so you don't injure yourself. Peloton bikes weigh 135 pounds (61 kg), so they're too heavy to move on your own. You can offer a friend some food, drinks, or cash to help you out with the move. [1] X Research source"

The adjusting rods are located under the seat (facing the front of the bike) and under the handlebars (also facing the front of the bike).

Secure these towels with bungee cords or tape. This will help to protect the bike from getting scratched. [3] X Research source Use towels you won’t need to use again, as they could get damaged during transport. Remember, you’re just doing this to protect the bike."

Weave it through the bottom back part of the buckle, pull it above the buckle, then weave it through the front top part of the buckle from the top. [6] X Research source When you’re done, the end of the strap should be pointing down away from you. Adjust the strap so that, when you’re standing, you can feel tension on your shoulders."

Lower your bike outside of your moving truck. Take a break before moving to the next step. Drink some water and stretch out your arms; this will help you avoid mishaps when loading the bike.

Then, using a person on each side (front and back), lift it onto the moving truck platform, making sure to lift with your legs, not your back. In a truck, it’s best to stabilize the bike with ratchet straps; just thread the strap from one side of the truck to the other, over the bike, and ratchet down until the bike is immobile."
