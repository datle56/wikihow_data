      "content": "Identify mood in literature by looking at context clues. While a personal “mood” can be defined as a temporary state of emotion, “mood” in literature refers to the emotions that a piece of writing can evoke in the reader. Typically, mood in literature is a result of diligent work on the writer’s behalf, as they have to consider style, tone, syntax, setting, and character interactions in order to create the exact emotional landscape that they seek. Here are some factors that contribute to mood in literature: [5] X Research source Setting: The place where a scene takes place can affect mood as much as the vocabulary used to describe it. For example, a beach usually denotes joy and relaxation, while a medieval Romanian castle creates feelings of dread and fear. Style: Style, or diction, refers to the specific words writers use to craft a story. For example, “rock” has a different connotation than “stone,” just like, “desire” is totally different from “wish.” Genre: French for “type” or “category,” genre refers to the kind of story being told. For example, a romance novel could be passionate and dramatic, while a gothic novel might be scary and unsettling."

      "content": "Practice writing every day. The saying “practice makes perfect” is true across the board, and writing is no exception. Author, Grant Faulkner, supports this idea, believing that writing every day is an essential part of getting better at it. He says, “Writing often— every day— is good. Try training yourself to write every day and create a writing routine.” Faulkner also encourages reading as integral to the process: “To learn to write well is to read a lot. This helps you get an appreciation of language through reading.” Faulkner adds, “The more you write, the more you're feeling the texture of words, and finding your voice and the tone of a story along the way.”"

      "content": "Don’t overcomplicate it. Writers who are just beginning to put pencil to paper might feel the need to overcomplicate their writing in order to add depth and nuance, but this may not always pay off. English teacher, Noah Taxis, notes this among his students and suggests writing plainly and directly before adding any bells and whistles. He says, “Focus on being as direct, simple, and clear as you possibly can, and just master that.” He explains that writing in this straightforward manner helps writers become more aware of what’s in their head by transferring it clearly onto the page. Then, he says, you can add in transitions, make the writing “fancier,” and add stronger vocabulary."

Whale she cites grammar as a major source of panic for writers, she reassures that you can always go back and fix it."
