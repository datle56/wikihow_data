      "content": "Raise your game to the next power with these smooth and flirty rizz lines. Using a pick up line is a great way to start a conversation with a math lover (and possibly get their number). Delivering rizz is all about timing, confidence, and charm, so if you’re ready to shoot your shot, try any of these smooth lines to show someone you’re interested : [1] X Research source Can I have your significant digits? You are one well-defined function. The square root of all my fantasies is you. I heard you like math, so what’s the sum of U+Me? You and I would add up better than a Riemann sum. Can I be your derivative? I’ll be the change you need. On a scale of 1-10, I’d rate you an i because you’re unreal. Are you the square root of 100? Because you’re a solid 10. Are you a math teacher? Because your curves are exponential. You must be a 90-degree angle because you’re looking all right! I know my math, and I’d say you definitely have a significant figure. Say yes to a date with me, and I’ll make all your worries polygon(e). Baby, you’re a 9.9999999999…but you’d be a 10 if you were with me. Are you a math problem? Because I’d stay up all night to work on you. I’m more interested in you than the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus. Who said math isn’t sexy? I’m feeling some serious calculust right now. Are you a math problem? Because you’re making me divide my attention. Are you good at math? Can you solve this equation for x? X= your number. Your hotness is the one thing keeping us from ever reaching Absolute Zero. If we’re both math majors, then why is there so much chemistry between us? Are you an exponent? Because my attraction to you is growing exponentially. Talking to you reminds me of calculus—I can’t figure you out, but I’d love to try. You must be the square root of -100…you’re a solid 10, but too good to be real! Do you like math? No? Me neither. In fact, the only number I care about is yours. I’ve memorized the first 200 digits of pi, and that was still easier than forgetting you. Are you the sum of the first positive odd integer? Because you’re truly one of a kind. Are you a quadratic equation? Because I can’t stop looking for the root of our attraction. Let’s play a math game. You be the numerator, and I’ll be the denominator. Then both of us reduce to the simplest form. I’ve memorized the first 300 digits of pi. If you gave me the 10 digits of your phone number, I bet I could memorize that too. I’m not a magician, but I am a mathematician—meaning I can’t make your problems disappear, but I can definitely help solve them. I can figure out the square root of any number in less than 10 seconds. What, you don’t believe me? Well, then, let’s try it with your phone number. You and I must be parallel lines because we have so much in common…but unlike parallel lines, I hope we get to meet up eventually. How about Saturday?"

Drop one of these spicy pick up lines to create sexual tension , in person or over text. Just make sure the other person feels comfortable with dirty talk and back off if they don’t respond in the same way! Here are some naughty options to use on any math nerd: [2] X Research source Can I explore your mean value? Wanna couple our equations tonight? You’ve got more curves than a triple integral. Your body has the nicest arc length I’ve ever seen. Let’s find out if we converge by taking each other to the limit. Can I be your integral? I want to be the area under your curves. I’m not that good at algebra, but I do know that you and I make 69. Are you a double integral? Because I want to cover all your surfaces. Can I be your derivative? Because I wanna lie tangent to your curves. I wish I was your secant line so I could touch you in at least two places. I wish I could transform you into a vector so I could dot you all night long. Huygens’ favorite curves were cycloids, but my favorite curves are yours. Are you a math teacher? Because you’ve got me harder than trigonometry. Are you a hyperbola? Because you’re making my asymptote approach infinity. Are you a compact set? Because I can’t wait to get you under my finite covers. Are you a sine wave? Because you’re making me oscillate in all the right places. Are you a matrix? Because you’ve got me in all the right positions and dimensions. How about we go beyond Pythagoras and explore some unknown angles together? Do you want to do some fractions with me? I’m like a numerator because I like to be on top. Let me perform some integration on you, so I can find the total area under your curves. Have you heard of the squeeze theorem? Because I want to take you to the limit from both sides. Let me be your numerator, and you can be my denominator—together, we’ll make an improper fraction. I’d love to be your math tutor for the night: add a bed, subtract your clothes, divide your legs and multiply! In Euclidean geometry, two parallel lines never touch. Let’s go back to my place and study some non-Euclidean geometry. Bertrand Russell was a renowned mathematician, philosopher and advocate for sexual liberation. How about we cut math and philosophy class and focus on the rest of Russell’s life?"

Starting a conversation with a pick up line is the perfect way to show off your personality and make a memorable first impression . While some math pick up lines are overused and cliché, the following lines are just the right amount of cheesy, creative, and charming: [3] X Research source 4+4=8 but you+me=fate You’re sweeter than 3.14. Hey, baby, what’s your sine? Is your name pi? Because you’re so sweet! I’m not being obtuse—you’re a-cute girl/guy. If you were a fraction, you’d be a proper one. Without you, my heart is like a null set…empty. Are you a right angle? Because you’re looking sharp. Let me be your abacus…you can always count on me. Can I be your cosine? Because I love to complement you. I’m bad at math, but I can give you the value you deserve. My attraction to you is growing exponentially by the minute. I must be a variable because you can’t predict what I’ll do next. You must be a mathematician because I can always count on you. Since you’re so good at math, can you replace my X without asking Y? Are you a non-repeating decimal? Because your beauty is never-ending. I must be a prime number because I’m only divisible by one, and that’s you. I’m not a math teacher, but I can definitely teach you a thing or two about love. Are you an equation? Because I want to work with you until we find the solution. Are you a perfect square? Because I’m feeling irrational, but you make me whole. Are you a math problem? Because you’ve got me in a constant state of confusion. At the risk of sounding Fibbonacheesy, you’re a cutie-pi and I’d love to take you out. Are you a square root? Because when I’m around you, things suddenly make sense. Geometry must be your best subject. Why? You’re proof that the perfect girl/guy exists. I see us as two coordinates on a graph…solitary now but destined to be connected by a line. My name is X, but you can call me “pi.” Why? Because I just can’t act rational when I’m around you!"

According to Jacoby, “positive comments, enthusiasm, and warmth” translate to every medium, whether you’re flirting in person or over text. If you want to make the other person feel good, give a genuine compliment about their personality or appearance—but be sure to add a math-related twist! Here are some adorable lines to melt their heart: [4] X Research source You are the square to my root. If you were a triangle, you’d be acute one. If beauty were a function, you’d be continuous. You and I add up better than the sum of our parts. I must be a function because I always return to you. Are you a set? Because you make my heart complete. Talking to you is as easy as pi. What’s your favorite flavor? Seeing you makes my heartbeat go from sin(x) to sin(10x). Are you a tangent? Because you’re always right next to me. I hate fractions. Will you be my other half and complete me? Are you a unit circle? Because you make my world go round. Are you a math book? Because you’ve got all the right curves. You are the sum of your divisions. In other words, you’re perfect. You must be a 90-degree angle, because you’re looking just right. I must be a factor because I want to make a difference in your life. Go on a date with me and we can make our own equation: 1+1=<3 You don’t have to be a math expert to realize we make the perfect pair. Want to know how much I like you? Divide by zero—it can’t be defined. Are you a negative number? Because you’re making my life feel positive. Are you the square root of 1? Because you’re making me feel all positive! Do you want to meet up for coffee? I promise to be a perfect tangentleman. I’m not a mathematician, but I’m pretty good with numbers. Can I have yours? Are you a Venn diagram? Because I see a lot of overlap between you and me. In math class, they always taught us to solve for X, but I’m glad I found U instead. If you were a function, you’d be my asymptote because I always tend toward you. You must be the sum of my dreams, because you’re everything I’ve been solving for. Are you a function? Because you’re always changing, but I still can’t get enough of you. Are you an algorithm? Because I’ve been searching for someone like you my whole life. Are you a non-terminating decimal? Because you go on forever, and I still can’t get enough. Are you the square root of -1? Because you can’t be real, but I can’t imagine life without you."

[5] X Trustworthy Source Greater Good Magazine Journal published by UC Berkeley's Greater Good Science Center, which uses scientific research to promote happier living Go to source So, throw out a witty pick up line to break the ice and make the other person laugh . The following lines might just win them over and make them want to spend more time with you: Hey girl, can I call-cu-later? Are you the factorial of 0? Because you’re the one. You’re like a statistics class—complicated, but worth it. I don’t like my current girlfriend. Mind if I do a you-substitution? Are you the cosine of 1? Because you’re making my head spin. Are you free on Friday? Because it’d be a sin not to ask you out. Are you my derivative? Because you’re making me rise over run. Turning down a date would be like the square root of -2…irrational! Are you a math book? Because you’ve got problems I want to solve. You must be the Pythagorean theorem because you’re so well-rounded. Are you a tangent line? Because you’re touching my heart at just one point. Are you into math? Because when I’m around you, I feel my interest rate rise. You must be a statistic, because you’ve got me thinking you’re one in a million. Did you take calculus? Because you derive me crazy with those beautiful eyes. Is your name Pythagoras? Because you make me want to square my hypotenuse. What’s 1+1? You’re obviously great at math—you should add me to your contacts! Are you a coefficient? Because you’ve got me multiplying my efforts to impress you. Geometry was one of my best subjects. Don’t believe me? Here’s a proof of my love. Are you a sine function? Because you’ve got me oscillating between “yes” and “yes.” How can I know the first 20 digits of pi and not know the 10 digits of your phone number? Do you like statistics? Because you’re definitely having a significant effect on my heart rate. You must be a math test, because you’re making me nervous and excited at the same time. You must be the hypotenuse of my life, because you’re the longest thing I’ve ever chased. Are you a complex number? Because you have a real and an imaginary part, and both are amazing. It’s great that we met in math class. Now I can ask you out because I know you can’t differentiate. You remind me of statistics…what is revealed is interesting, but what is hidden is the important part. I have a trig-gy question for you. Any chance you’re sin2x? Because I’m cos2x, which means that together we’d make one!"

If you really want to impress your crush , incorporate different math concepts, terms, or symbols into your pick up line. You could use phrases that involve connection, solving something together, or complementing each other to score major points, or mention a code or theory they might not be familiar with (while still keeping it easy to understand). Here are some pick up lines to blow their mind: [6] X Research source You’re the Euler to my equations…simply irreplaceable. My love for you is like e^x…it doesn’t change at any rate! Are you a Hamming code? Because I think you’re perfect. We’re a Cauchy sequence…it’s going to happen eventually. I’ll be your Cartesian Plane because I want to map your curves. Are you orthogonal? Because our connection feels perfectly right. I wonder what the L’Hospital’s rule says of the limit when I is over you. Are you a scalar? Because you’re adding value to everything in my life. You’re like a non-Euclidean geometry—bending all the rules of attraction. Are you the Fibonacci sequence? Because you’re spiraling into my heart. Are you a fractal? Because the closer I look, the more stunning details I see. Are you a Hamiltonian operator? Because you’ve got my energy levels rising. You must be a Fourier series, because you’re making all my frequencies align. I’d love to be your cofactor so we can find the determinant of this connection together. Are you a commutative ring? Because you’ve got me going in circles thinking about you. Are you a topoplogizing subcategory of an abelian category? Because you’re looking thicc. Do you satisfy all the sentences of some formal theory? Because you look like a model. Are you a solution to the P vs NP problem? Because you’re looking like a million dollars. You must be a normal distribution, because you’re always at the center of my attention. Are you modular arithmetic? Because I feel like we’re on the same wavelength no matter what. I’ve been thinking about asking you out, and it feels like √(–1): complex, but hopefully not imaginary! Are you the non-trivial reduced local homology group of a manifold? Because I'd like you to be on top. Let’s take our relationship to the nth dimension—because I’m feeling infinite possibilities with you. You’re like a topological space…no matter how you twist or turn, you’re always connected to my heart. Why don’t we use some Fourier analysis on our relationship and reduce to a series of simple periodic functions? Hey, do you know how to draw a brachistochrone curve? Because I want to get with you as quickly as possible."

      "content": "Wait for the perfect time to drop your line. Timing is everything when it comes to delivering pick up lines, so feel the flow of the conversation before making your move. In general, opening with a rizz joke is the perfect formula to flirt with someone and make a memorable introduction. But if you’re already chatting, wait for a break in conversation to score big in love. If you’re approaching someone in person, Jacoby says “being friendly is all it takes.” You don’t have to be “super smooth or rehearsed all the time,” and having a “big smile and a warm personality” can help you make a good first impression."

      "content": "Personalize your joke to show off your humor. When you’re starting out, it’s great to have a bunch of pick up lines in your back pocket. But if you want to level up your game, reference your crush’s favorite subject, formula, or theory. This makes your line less generic, plus makes the other person feel special . When initiating a conversation on a dating app, Bilotta says to “avoid using generic opening lines and instead strive for a personalized approach that demonstrates your interest and sincerity.” Be sure to “use an interesting and engaging conversation starter that shows you've taken the time to read the other person's profile.”"

Confidence is one of the biggest factors when it comes to flirting with someone, and if you don’t look comfortable delivering your pick up line, it’ll show. Make sure to look at the other person directly and flash a smile to make them feel at ease. If it helps, practice saying your line in the mirror so you sound more natural and effortless. If you’re flirting with someone on a dating app, Bilotta says “emojis can be a great way to add a playful tone to your messages and convey your sense of humor.” Send a 😉, 😈, or 😏 to lighten the mood and be extra flirty!"

      "content": "Respect the other person’s boundaries. In general, a person will appreciate a flirty joke if they’re interested, but feel uncomfortable or creeped out if they don’t like you. Before shooting your shot, think of how the other person acts when they’re around you. Some signs that they might be interested include: having open body language, making eye contact, trying to touch you, fidgeting around you, or giving you compliments. If you’re on a date, you can tell it’s going well if the person is “facing you or mirroring your body language,” according to Jacoby. If your pick up line falls flat, don’t try to explain it. Instead, make a joke about the line! For example, you could tell them it was terrible but that they were making you nervous. Bilotta says, “one of the best ways to put someone at ease and build a connection is to be willing to laugh at yourself.”"
