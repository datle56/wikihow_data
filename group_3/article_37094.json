      "content": "Locate the current run capacitor but do not touch it (the capacitor must be discharged before it is safe to handle). It will have a cylindrical, canister-like shape. It will have three terminals on top. There will be colored wires coming from the AC Unit to some if not all of the terminals on the capacitor."

      "content": "Inspect run capacitor to see if it needs to be replaced. The top of the run capacitor should be perfectly flat. If you see that the top side is bulging upwards in any way, it needs to be replaced. If this is not the case, a faulty capacitor may not be the source of the issue. You may need to contact your local HVAC professional."

Take a picture with your smart phone to record how everything is installed to make sure the new capacitor is connected in the same way. Jotting down these details on a piece of paper will also work."

      "content": "Discharge the capacitor. To do this you are going to create a bridge between the C terminal and the HERM/FAN terminals, one at a time, using the metal part of the screwdriver. Ensure you are not touching anything metal. With the metal part of the screwdriver, touch a metal prong on the C terminal AND another from the HERM terminal at the same time, creating a bridge between the two. This may produce a shock. Do this two more times to ensure the terminals were completely discharged. Do the same to the C and FAN terminals."

The simplest way to make sure you buy the correct one is to order the same model number from the same manufacturer. There are occasions where another brand might be more affordable. In this case you want to make sure to match the specifications on the old capacitor."
