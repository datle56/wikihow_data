      "content": "Understand how to describe a color. Here, the color is a noun (a thing), and you are using an adjective to describe it. The adjective endings change according to certain rules. All colors are neuter nouns in German, so these rules work with all colors. For colors with an indefinite article (a/an), the adjective ending is -es. Ein schönes Blau means 'a beautiful blue.' For colors with a definite article (the), the adjective ending is -e. Das schöne Blau means 'the beautiful blue.' The rules for the endings change depending on which case the color noun is in, and when the color noun is plural. You can see these patterns in the Things You'll Need section . These endings work for color nouns in the nominative (the color is the subject) and accusative (the color is the direct object) cases."

      "title": "Tell someone that a certain color (or colors) please you.",
      "content": "Tell someone that a certain color (or colors) please you. When German speakers talk about something they like, they use a construction which translates to “… pleases me/pleases me not”. The simplest version of this construction is “Das gefällt mir”. (That pleases me/I like that.) To negate it, we add the word nicht at the end of the sentence. “Das gefällt mir nicht” (that pleases me not/that does not please me/I do not like that.) Say it like this: Dahss gə-fellt meer nisht [nıçt] You can replace “das” in the sentence with a color. “Blau gefällt mir” means “I like blue”. You can add “das“ back in to talk about a specific color. “Das Blau gefällt mir nicht” means “I do not like the/that blue”. Add more adjectives from previous steps to be even more specific. Example: “Ein schönes Dunkelgrün gefällt mir.” (I like a beautiful dark green.) Example: “Das hässliche Hellbraun gefällt mir nicht.” (I don’t like that ugly light brown.) The colors are capitalized in the above examples because they are being used as nouns. This is not always the case, so be careful and pay attention to your writing."

      "content": "Ask for a color name. Say “Welche Farbe hat…?” Replace […] with the object about which you are inquiring and its proper article. This translates to “which color has…”. In German, we ask if things have a certain color rather than are a certain color. Say it like this: Vel-shə ['vɛlçǝ] Fah-bə hat…. Example: “Welche Farbe hat der Tisch?” (Which color is the table?) Example: “Welche Farbe hat ihre Bluse?” (Which color is her blouse?) The object you're asking about (e.g. the table) is actually the subject of this sentence, as it is what the sentence is about (even though it is the second noun in the sentence). Therefore, follow the rules of the Nominativ (subject) case: Welche Farbe hat der Tisch/ein Tisch/er? ."

      "title": "Add the correct ending to colors when used as adjectives before a noun.",
      "content": "Add the correct ending to colors when used as adjectives before a noun. In German, adjectives (only adjectives directly before a noun) take endings based on the case, gender, and number (singular/plural) of the noun. Then, check if an article or determiner precedes the noun. Articles specify the noun, and determiners add detail. There are three \"groups\" of articles and determiners, each with separate sets of adjective endings attached. For a full list of these rules, see the Things You'll Need section . Here are some example sentences in different cases: [6] X Research source Nominative : Die grün e Wiese ist schön - the green meadow is beautiful. Der blau e Himmel ist schön - the blue sky is beautiful. Accusative : Ich sehe die braun e , freundliche Katze - I see the brown, friendly cat. Ich suche nach einem alten, blau en Buch - I am looking for an old blue book. Dative : Ich gebe dem schwarz en Hund Wasser - I give water to the black dog. Ich helfe mit dem schweren, blau en Koffer - I help with the heavy, blue suitcase. Genitive : Der Geschmack des alten, rot en Weins ist ausgezeichnet - the taste of the old red wine is excellent.
