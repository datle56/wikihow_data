Don’t think too hard about it. Just jot down the first things that come to your mind without deciding whether they’re doable or not. Or, try making a mindmap by writing “New Year’s Resolutions” in the center of your paper and filling the space with related ideas.

      "content": "Commit to 1-2 of the highest-priority changes on your list. Look at your list of brainstormed ideas and start to prioritize the ones that are most important to you. Sort them into categories like “most important,” “important,” and “least important.” Then, take the “most important” category and put the ideas in order from most to least important. [2] X Research source Choose only the top 1-2 changes to make into your resolutions. Be ruthless when you narrow your list down. Limiting yourself to 1-2 resolutions allows you to really focus on them. Remember, you don’t have to change everything at once when setting goals for the year. If you pick too many goals, you may set yourself up to fail when you notice how much work you have to do to achieve them all. Write your resolutions down to make them more concrete. Tell your friends and family what your resolution is for the year."

Try to set goals that are a little challenging but still possible when you take your current situation and limitations into account. This means being honest with yourself about what you can realistically fit into your life. [3] X Research source You may have good intentions to work out every day, but if you don’t currently have a regular workout schedule and you already have a full schedule, it may not be attainable. Avoid choosing a goal you’ve failed in the past. To revive a failed resolution, think about why you failed in the past and adjust the goal to make it more doable."

I think it's really important to [not just] set goals but also get clear on what's your ‘why’ behind the goal. [4] X Expert Source Sydney Axelrod Certified Life Coach Expert Interview. 30 June 2020. Choose a resolution that inspires you or sparks your interest to learn or do more and get closer to your ideal self. Select a resolution that helps you grow as a person.

      "content": "Be as specific as possible with your goals. Vague resolutions like “save more money” or “lose weight” make it hard to measure your progress. It’s also difficult to know what exact steps you need to take to get there. [5] X Research source Use more specific language when you set your goals to give yourself a clear target to shoot for. Axelrod recommends getting really specific and clear on what you're going to do and why you're going to do it. Ask yourself 3 questions. “What will I do?” “When will I do it?” “How will I know I’m done?” [6] X Expert Source Sydney Axelrod Certified Life Coach Expert Interview. 30 June 2020. Instead of saying, “I want to lose weight,” say, “I want to lose an average of 1 pound a week.” Research exactly what steps you need to take if you want to accomplish the goal of losing an average of 1 pound a week. A specific goal like “lose an average of 1 pound a week” is easy to measure because you know whether you did it or not. Focus on changing 1 behavior at a time. For example, with the goal of “lose an average of 1 pound a week,” you could decide that you want to increase your activity level by walking 30 minutes per day."

Once you have a resolution in mind, ask yourself what steps you must take to reach the larger goal. Then, write out an action plan for what each step is and when you want to complete it. [8] X Research source Make each step easy to achieve. This is especially important at the beginning of the process, when it’s often the hardest to get motivated. Set realistic deadlines for each step toward your resolution. It takes time to make meaningful changes. Get out a calendar and write out your plan for each mini-goal.

If you can’t find a buddy in your friend circle, try joining a local club or online group of people who have similar goals. Try to find a resolution buddy who’s just a little closer to their goal to help challenge you to step up your game. For example, if your goal is to run a marathon, find someone who can make it just a block or two farther than you."

Set up a system of reminders to help you stay on track. Your system can be as sophisticated as setting up alerts on your phone or computer…or as simple as a note stuck to your bathroom mirror. The important thing is that it works for you . [11] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Use that calendar to give yourself reminders to help you stay on track. Add your resolution steps to your daily “to-do” list. Use objects associated with your goal to keep it top of mind. For example, if your resolution is to go for a 15-minute jog at lunch, put your running shoes in front of your door so you remember to take them with you."

Simply refer to this tool at the beginning and end of each week and month to review how far you've come.” [12] X Expert Source Amber Rosenberg, PCC Founder of Pacific Life Coach Expert Interview. 26 April 2021. Keep a daily journal dedicated to your resolutions, or use a habit-tracking app. On days when you feel like you’re not moving forward, use your log to see how far you’ve come! For example, if you’ve made a resolution to read 20 minutes a day, find an app that helps you keep track of the time you spend reading. Try a generic habit-tracking journal or apps if you can’t find one specifically for your goal."

When you first get started, it will take more time and energy to focus on your daily goal,” says Rosenberg. [14] X Expert Source Amber Rosenberg, PCC Founder of Pacific Life Coach Expert Interview. 26 April 2021. After that 21 days, you may find you need to adjust your goal. You might have made progress faster than expected or need a little more time to get to the next step. Both of those situations are perfectly fine! Use your experience to adjust your resolution and action plan to get back on track. You don’t have to be perfect 100% of the time to make progress. Give yourself a little grace if you have a setback, like catching a cold…or even if you just feel like skipping a day. It’s completely normal to have days—or even weeks—when you just don’t have the energy. Don’t let that discourage you, though. Remember, it’s only a failure if you quit forever. So, keep going. You got this!"

Prochaska and Carlo Di Clemente in 1977. It sounds complicated, but it really is a simple list of stages that describe how ready a person is to make a change in their life. Understanding the stages may help you get an idea of where you are in the process and what you need to do to move forward. The stages include: [19] X Research source Precontemplation: The person has not acknowledged they have a problem they want to change. Contemplation: They know there’s a problem, but they aren’t ready or lack confidence to do anything about it. Preparation/Determination: The person has decided they want to make the change and is preparing to do something. Action/Willpower: They begin taking steps to change their behavior. Maintenance: The person has changed their behavior and is maintaining that change."
