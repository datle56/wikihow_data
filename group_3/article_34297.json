According to computer & tech expert Luigi Oppido, Adobe makes a free reader program that can be downloaded from their website. You can also download readers from a variety of other developers. If you'd rather not download a reader program, most browsers can open PDF files in a browser window. The screenshots here may be different for a variety of factors, such as what program you're using (Adobe vs Word vs Chrome) or what printer you have (Canon vs HP)."

This is especially important if you are in an environment with more than one printer. Check that the printer you selected is either directly connected to the computer or the network you are using and is working perfectly. A sufficient amount of paper should also be loaded in the printer. Don't have a printer?

From here several selections can be made to the layout, finish, and other features of the PDF file. Additionally, this is where you'd select whether to print in color or in black and white. The location of features will vary depending on the software you are using to open the PDF file. In Adobe Reader, a front cover as well as a back cover can be printed from the \"Cover Mode\" tab. In addition, in order to save printer toner \"Toner Save\" can be selected under \"Quality\". This will slightly reduce the quality of the final printed file. An additional way to save paper is to print double-sided by selecting \"Two-Sided\" under Print Type from the \"Layout\" tab. [1] X Research source"
