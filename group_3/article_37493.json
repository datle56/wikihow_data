      "content": "Consider the state of each car. Some vehicles may need more extensive mechanical work, while others may only need the oil changed. Likewise, some car bodies will be in pristine condition while others might look like a pile of rust. Check for things like a solid structure or a running motor and only take on repairs that you are comfortable with doing."

      "content": "Look for dents on the body panels. It is a common misconception that dents can just be “popped out.” For the most part, this is untrue, though for some specific cases there does exist a highly specialized technique called paintless dent repair (PDR). [2] X Research source Almost always, fixing a dent will mean grinding off the existing paint, pulling the dent, filling it with body filler, priming to protect the metal, and then repainting the panel."

      "content": "Inspect the condition of the paint. Even if you do not like the color or intend to paint the whole car anyway, a healthy coat of paint on all of the panels means a couple of things. First, a lack of serious scratches on the original paint means that this car likely wasn’t involved in major accidents that could damage the frame. Second, paint protects the metal panels on your car from rust. [3] X Research source All bare metal should be primed before painting. All metal should be covered with primer, paint, or another appropriate sealant to protect from rust. [4] X Research source"

Even if no repair is needed this will allow you to give the seats and the interior deep cleaning. Inspect the seats. If there are any cuts or gashes in the upholstery, you can try to repair them. If they are large or you have multiple damages, your seats may need to be reupholstered. Stains can often be removed by cleaning with appropriate stain removers. If you can’t get the stain out, you may consider reupholstering the seat."
