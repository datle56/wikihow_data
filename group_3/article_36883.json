      "content": "Check for a lens error pop-up. There are lots of things that could possibly explain a digital camera lens problem. If you're having trouble with the lens, first check your camera to see if there's a lens error pop-up on your camera screen. If this is the case, it means your camera has picked up on the issue as well. If there's nothing, it may mean that the issue is external (too much dirt on the lens) or a possible glitch in the system."

      "content": "Consider anything that may have happened to the camera recently. Most errors with a digital camera lens are caused by dropping the camera. There are lots of potential circumstances where a phone could be dropped. Spilling liquids on a camera or putting the camera somewhere coarse (like a sandy beach) will also damage a camera's lens and software. Knowing how the problem arose won't ensure you'll be able to fix it, but it may be able to steer you on the right path."

      "content": "Take out the battery and memory card. A common trick with most devices (including cameras and cellphones) is to disconnect the power for a few minutes. This allows your device to reset. If the lens problem is due to an issue with the software, taking out the battery and memory card for 15 minutes may remove a lens error pop-up."

      "title": "Smack the side of the camera.",
      "content": "Smack the side of the camera. [1] X Research source Although it may seem like an act of last-ditch frustration more than a helpful repair technique, some people have reported having success with slapping the side of their camera with the palm of their hand. If the camera's issue is that the lens house is stuck, the force of a smack may loosen the camera's insides, solving the problem for you. Using the side of a pencil to tap the camera barrel works too, if you're worried the force of your hand might damage the camera further."

      "title": "Clean the lens barrel.",
      "content": "Clean the lens barrel. A compressed air spray duster can get into the cracks of your camera's lens barrel and clear out the built up gunk. Spray it evenly in the cracks, and anywhere else on your model you think excess dust may have built up. Power off and restart your phone to check and see if this technique worked at all."

      "content": "Plug in the AV cable. It may be that your camera simply need an added boost of energy to deal with dust particles clogging the lens. Plugging in your cable for 5 minutes will give your camera extra energy. If this is the case, your camera should be fine within a few minutes."

      "title": "Adjust the lens housing manually.",
      "content": "Adjust the lens housing manually. Sometimes, the problem with your camera may be mechanical. If the lens won't extend, only extends partially, or extends and then retracts again, then gently moving the lens barrel around may help to unstick it. You can gently push or pull on the lens, which may be enough to loosen whatever is causing it to stick. If the lens won't extend even a little, turn on the camera and then tap the front of the camera against a cupped hand.

      "title": "Force an autofocus.",
      "content": "Force an autofocus. When digital cameras extend their barrel, they will attempt to auto-focus themselves. This may help fix whatever problem your camera is having. Hold down the shutter button to begin moving the barrel. While you have the shutter button held down, press the power button. It helps to plant the camera on a flat surface, with the lens facing up."

      "title": "Call the manufacturer.",
      "content": "Call the manufacturer. If you've been able to rule out some easily solvable issues, it's a good idea to touch base with the manufacturer. Call the hotline of the company that produced your camera. Once you're patched through to a company representative, outline the problems you've been grappling with. If it sounds like a common issue with the camera, he'll be able to lead you through some of the solutions that are specifically suited to your model. Digital camera companies will usually have a hotline listed on their website."

[4] X Research source If you're out of luck and can't find a viable solution to your camera troubles at home, it may be time to seek professional help. Camera and electronics repair stores will take your camera and fix the problem for a price. It's only recommended that you get it repaired if you've exhausted all the easy possible fixes. You'll still be charged an expensive fee even if the solution takes them two minutes, so make sure it's worth your while to do so. Repairs can be very expensive. In some cases, they may actually be more expensive than the value of the camera. Keep this in mind and make sure you get a price estimate before handing your device over for repair."

      "content": "Buy a new camera lens. Camera lenses can be removed and replaced. Chances are your camera model is fairly common. Rest assured you're not the first person who has had a foul-up with the lens. If your digital camera works perfectly otherwise, you might consider getting the lens replaced. You can either get it from a camera store, or have it ordered directly from the manufacturer. Only replace the camera lens yourself if you really know what you're doing. The user manual that came with your digital camera should offer some guidance in this regard."

      "content": "Consider buying a new camera. Unfortunately, it may come to a point where you have no option but to count your losses and send your broken camera to the dumps. Getting a new camera will save you the effort of having to repair it, and though you'll be potentially putting down a lot of money for a new one, you stand to gain a more advanced model than the one you had before. If you use your camera enough, you might even find that getting a sharper type of camera will have been worth it all along. Most modern cellphones come equipped with built-in cameras. This can absolve you of the need to purchase a replacement digital camera if you already have a phone cam."
