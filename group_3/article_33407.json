      "title": "Decide on your clothing rules.",
      "content": "Decide on your clothing rules. All players should begin a game of Strip Twister wearing the same number of articles of clothing. 5 or 6 articles of clothing tends to work best. [1] X Research source Hats, socks, shoes, and jewelry count as clothing articles. If you’re wearing too much, take some accessories off before playing; if you’re wearing too few, ask if you can borrow someone’s scarf or hat. This can be a sweaty game, so be sure to play in a well-ventilated area. Open windows (but not curtains!), turn on fans, and have water readily accessible for players who need it. (The referee can serve thirsty players with straws, maybe.) Don’t be that person: be recently showered and apply deodorant before gameplay."

      "title": "Divide into teams.",
      "content": "Divide into teams. Twister may be played by 2 or more people, making Strip Twister a great game for couples or for a group. Each player may serve as their own team, or you can divide players into teams of 2 or more. [2] X Research source If you’re playing the game with couples, each couple can be their own team. If you don’t have an equal number of players, ask one person to serve as the referee and official spinner. This may be an ideal job for someone who doesn’t want to play Strip Twister but still wants to participate. If you do have an even number of players, the referee position will rotate amongst the players. If you prefer not to play with teams, each player can play on their own individual team."

      "title": "Spread your mat across the floor and stand at the edge of the mat.",
      "content": "Spread your mat across the floor and stand at the edge of the mat. Players (or teams of players) should start at opposite ends of the mat, with each person standing near the word Twister. If you’re playing with 3 or more people or teams, have each participant or team stand on a different side of the mat. [3] X Research source If you’re playing with a huge group of people, consider getting 2 Twister mats and dividing players evenly among them. Whether you’re playing regular Twister or Strip Twister, start with your shoes off. You don’t want to break anyone’s hand with your clodhoppers."
    },
    {
      "title": "Put a hand or foot on the color the referee calls out.",
      "content": "Put a hand or foot on the color the referee calls out. Every time the referee spins the spinner, they will call out the body part and color the spinner points to. Each player must place that body part on the corresponding circle. A circle must be vacant for a player to be able to use it. [4] X Research source If you’re playing Twister with teams, each member of each team will play in each round. While opposing teams cannot occupy the same spot on the mat, members of the same team may share spots as needed. If a player currently has a body part on a color and that color is called again, the player must move to a new circle of that same color. If two players reach for the same circle at the same time, it is up to the referee to decide who got there first. If all six circles of the same color are already covered, the referee must spin again until a new color can be called out."

      "title": "Take off an article of clothing whenever the spinner lands on red.",
      "content": "Take off an article of clothing whenever the spinner lands on red. If red is called on your turn, you and everyone on your team must lose a piece of clothing, no exceptions! The catch is that only one hand or foot may be lifted from the mat at a time while removing clothing. [5] X Research source When removing clothing, the hand or foot must be placed back on the spot it originated from before another hand or foot can be lifted."

    {
      "title": "Remove clothing every time you fall.",
      "content": "Remove clothing every time you fall. Since this is Twister with a twist, there are certain penalties in this game that do not exist in the standard game of Twister. In regular Twister, if a player falls, they are automatically removed from the game. In Strip Twister, they just remove an article of clothing. Whoever has the most clothing on at the end wins the game. [6] X Research source If a player falls while removing an article of clothing, they must remove an additional item of clothing as a penalty. Anyone caught cheating in any form will be penalized by having to remove an additional article of clothing."

      "title": "Modify the game to suit your needs.",
      "content": "Modify the game to suit your needs. If you choose to play Strip Twister with a larger group, you may decide to add additional restrictions to make the game more competitive or more conservative as needed. Players may choose to strip down only to their undergarments or bathing suits. Bathing suit Strip Twister is a great game to play at the beach. Add more opportunities to strip: for instance, players must lose clothing on either red or yellow (or another color of your choosing). To take things to the next level, assign other penalties to certain colors. For example, every time a team lands on blue, they must fake an orgasm or kiss another player."

      "title": "Play Naked Twister.",
      "content": "Play Naked Twister. Instead of gradually taking off your clothing throughout the game, play regular Twister, just butt-naked. Up the ante by distracting opponents with physical affection—or by, y’know, just being naked. [7] X Research source If you’re playing Strip or Naked Twister with a significant other, try playing on the bed for extra intimacy. Depending on your level of familiarity with your opponent(s), lick, nuzzle, kiss, or tickle the competition to get them to relinquish their spot on the board. Make the game more romantic by turning down the lights and adding some candles. Just make sure not to knock the candles over in the heat of the moment."

      "title": "Make it a drinking game.",
      "content": "Make it a drinking game . In Drunk Naked Twister, each player begins naked, but they must take a shot each time they stumble or slip on the mat—as long as they don’t fall. The game continues until everyone has fallen or until everyone has drunk so much that they can’t go on. Use small shot glasses for drinks; otherwise players may get too drunk too quickly. At best, the game will end really fast. At worst, someone might vomit or get hurt. You can choose to increase the number of shots a player has to take for each slip. For example, after the first slip, they might take 1 shot, after the second, 2 and so on."

      "title": "Play Oily Twister.",
      "content": "Play Oily Twister. Take Naked Twister one step further by rubbing your opponent down with baby oil before beginning the game. Play Naked Twister as you normally would, but expect to spend most of the time slipping and sliding across the board. In keeping with the theme, the loser of Oily Twister must give the winner a full-body massage."
