You are my ride or die, my friend for life, and my entire universe. I just want you to know that I will always love and care for you. You’ll never be alone as long as I’m around.” “It’s crazy how you can go through life thinking you were complete until you fall in love. Now, I can’t even go five minutes without you!

I love you.” “Words can’t describe how much you mean to me. You make me feel safe and supported, and I haven’t felt this way in a long time. It scares me because I’ve never felt so loved by anyone, but I keep reminding myself to appreciate all the moments I have with you. I love you so much.” “When I’m going through a tough time, everything fades away when I see you. Just being by your side gives me the strength I need to get through the day, and you make me feel like everything’s going to be okay. Thank you for showing me what it means to love unconditionally. I love you more than you will ever know.” “I just want you to know that I’m not going anywhere. I want you on your good days, your bad days, and all the days in between. You don’t have to hide or ‘be perfect’ for me. I just want the real you. That’s who I fell in love with, and who I am still in love with today. Know that I always have your back, through the highs and lows.” “Whatever challenges come our way, we’ll face them together, babe. I feel like nothing can hold me back when I’m by your side, and I hope you feel the same way about me. You lift me up when I’m feeling down, and I can’t wait for everyone to appreciate the brilliant and incredible person you are. Here’s to tackling the world together!” “I didn’t think it was possible to miss someone this much, but I’m going crazy without you! I miss driving you to work, walking to the park together, fighting over the last bite… Next week can’t come soon enough. I might not be there in person right now, but I guarantee you’re all I think about. I can’t wait to kiss you and melt in your arms.” “I never want you to feel less than beautiful around me. When you’re chilling at home with no makeup on, you take my breath away. When you walk into a room in full glam, you capture everyone’s attention. You are absolutely enchanting, and I feel so lucky to call you mine. Never doubt the effect you have on me… even after all these years.” “I never knew I could love someone as much as I love you, but my heart keeps proving me wrong. I find new things I love about you every day, and it feels like my heart could just explode at any point. You’re the first person I want to tell when things go wrong or when they go right, and I feel like I can be my true self around you. I am beyond lucky to have fallen in love with my best friend.”"
