      "content": "Get a masculine haircut from a barber or men’s hairstylist. [2] X Expert Source Shahpar Mirza Community Transgender Expert Expert Interview. 3 March 2020. Since many women now sport short hair, simply having short hair won't help you pass. It’s important to get your hair cut by a barber or by someone who cuts men’s hair often. Avoid going to a hairstylist who does not cut men’s hair and who might give you a short, feminine cut. When you go to get your hair cut, tell them what style you want. Save a few pictures of haircuts you like and show these to them. Ask the barber or stylist to shave your sideburns as well. Any long hair in the sideburn area can read as female. Keep in mind that the barber or stylist will likely ask you questions about how you want your hair cut. Don’t be afraid to tell them exactly what you want and don’t allow them to talk you out of it. You have every right to get your hair cut however you want it!"

      "content": "Style your hair with gel, pomade, or another men’s hair product. You’re more likely to look masculine if your hair is styled back and out of your face. You can achieve this using hair gel or pomade. This is especially important if your haircut is on the longer side, since bangs or hair hanging down next to your face may be read by strangers as female. [3] X Research source Try applying a generous amount of gel to your hair and combing it straight back for a simple way to keep it out of your face."

      "title": "Shave your face",
      "content": "Shave your face to eliminate peach fuzz. While shaving may not seem necessary if you don’t have visible hair on your face, doing so is important because women tend to have a soft layer of peach fuzz-like hair on their faces. Men usually don't have this after puberty. They either grow long facial hair or shave regularly to remove any new growth. Since growing facial hair may not be an option for you, it’s important to shave at least every other day to get rid of the peach fuzz. [4] X Research source Use shaving cream and a new razor every time you shave to prevent cuts. You might also consider using an aftershave to help prevent skin infections and for a masculine scent."

      "content": "Avoid wearing makeup of any kind or plucking your eyebrows. You can darken your eyebrows and draw a light moustache. Do not make it too dark or it will look fake. Makeup can cause your face to look more feminine, so by avoiding it, you’ll automatically look more masculine . You could look up contour videos on YouTube to sharpen your jawline for example, if that's something you feel like you'd be more comfortable with. Men also tend to have thicker eyebrows, so not plucking can also help to make your face seem more masculine."

      "content": "Bind your chest to create the appearance of pecs. If you have a small chest, you might be able to get away with wearing a tight-fitting sports bra . However, if you have average or large breasts, binding will be necessary to help you pass. You can purchase a binder to wear under your clothing and get the appearance of a masculine chest. [5] X Expert Source Shahpar Mirza Community Transgender Expert Expert Interview. 3 March 2020. Make sure that you don’t wear a binder for more than 8 hours daily. Wear a properly sized binder. Wearing a binder that is too tight restricts your breathing and can damage breast tissue [6] X Research source . The goal of binding is not to make your chest completely flat. Instead, the aim is to imitate pectorals (\"pecs\"). Never use ACE bandages to bind your chest. They tend to slip down and they are also quite tight, which can restrict your breathing."

      "content": "Stuff your pants in a realistic way. You can purchase a prosthetic (these are called \"packers\" and are available online) or create your own item using condoms, alcohol-free hair gel, and a nylon stocking. Fill a condom about halfway full with hair gel, tie it off, then insert it into a second condom to prevent leakage. Then, place the condom in a nylon stocking and tie this off so that the nylon is tight against the condoms. [7] X Research source Most men don’t have a noticeable bulge in their pants when their penis is not erect, so keep this in mind if you stuff. You might also look into prosthetic devices for packing hard. You can buy a prosthetic penis from adult stores to wear for sex."

      "content": "Buy tops that hide your chest. Opt for looser fitting clothing to help hide your chest. Men’s button-down shirts are good options. Steer clear of anything that clings to your body, such as silk and synthetic fabrics. Chose structured cotton and linen shirts instead. Try to get tops with designs on them. This will draw attention away from your chest and more to the print. Layering your shirts can also be helpful. Try wearing a white crew-neck t-shirt under a button-down shirt or polo shirt. Hoodies can be a lifesaver. They're androgynous, baggy, and hide your chest well. Go with a black hoodie when possible, as it will mask your chest even more."

      "content": "Choose straight-legged jeans, pants, and men’s shorts. Men’s and women’s pants are cut differently, so it’s important to wear only or mostly men’s pants to help you pass. A pair of black men’s work pants or khakis is a great option for building a masculine look. If you prefer jeans, buy loose-fitting men’s jeans that have straight legs. Steer clear of skinny jeans and bootcut jeans as these will show off more of your curves."

Shop for your shoes in the men’s department and stick to masculine colors, such as grey, black, blue, brown, etc. Invest in a pair of dress shoes for special occasions and a pair of casual shoes, such as sneakers. If you have small feet, check the boys shoe department to find a pair that works for you. You can look for shoes in a shoe store, or shop for your shoes online for a wider variety of sizes, styles, and colors. Good shoes to opt for are sneakers, loafers, and boots. Women are often seen in flats, heels, and sandals, so stay away from those."

      "content": "Get a special swimsuit to use at the beach or pool. Passing at the pool or at the beach can be more challenging, but it is possible with the right swimwear. Men generally wear swim trunks and no shirt at the beach or at a pool. However, you can purchase a wetsuit or swim vest to cover your chest. Or, you can simply wear a T-shirt with your swim trunks. Take precautions to bind safely. It's commonly advised to wear a binder that's one size larger than your usual wear if you go exercising or swimming. Also check whether your binder's material can safely get wet."

      "content": "Accessorize with masculine items like ties and watches. A stylish men’s watch, a tie, or another masculine accessory can help you to pass. Buy men’s sunglasses, wear men’s jewelry (if you like jewelry), and adopt a men’s cologne as your signature scent. Avoid extra-large watches if you have small wrists since this can make your wrists look even smaller."

      "content": "Take up space rather than trying to be unobtrusive. Women tend to make themselves look smaller, such as by crossing their legs, slouching, or keeping their arms tucked in. Do the opposite of these things to appear more masculine. Sit with your legs spread apart, sit or stand up straight and tall, and take up space with your arms. For example, if you’re standing, keep your feet shoulder-width apart, stand up straight, and let your arms hang down at your sides. If you’re sitting, place your feet flat on the ground with your knees about 12 in (30 cm) apart, and lean back with 1 or both arms resting on the back of neighboring chairs."

      "content": "Practice giving a firm, confident handshake when you meet people. A firm handshake is an important sign of masculinity. When you shake someone’s hand, stand up or lean down so you are at their eye level. Then, look them in the eye , grip their hand firmly, and shake their hand up and down 2 to 3 times. After that, release their hand and return to a relaxed standing or seated position. Avoid holding onto their hand for more than 5 seconds. Any longer and it might get awkward."

      "content": "Maintain a monotone voice as much as possible. Women tend to change pitch when they’re speaking, so this can be a giveaway. Practice speaking in a monotone voice to seem more masculine. Don’t worry about the tone of your voice as much as the steadiness of it. Men have varying tones of voice, so having a higher pitched voice is not necessarily a giveaway. Listen to how men speak in movies, podcasts, and TV shows and try to emulate their voices."

      "content": "Try using a stand-to-pee device if you dislike sitting down. It’s totally fine to pee sitting down in a men’s restroom. There are even some men who do this out of personal preference or necessity. However, if you want to stand to pee, there are ways you can do this. The best option is to use a stand-to-pee (StP) device. You can make one yourself or purchase one to use. Practice using the device at home until you have mastered it. You can practice in the shower at first and then use the device whenever you use the bathroom. Once you feel comfortable, start taking the device with you. StP devices are usually quite small, so you can easily fit one in your pocket."
