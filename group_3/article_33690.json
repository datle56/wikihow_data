      "content": "Polygel nails are an acrylic/gel hybrid. The polygel nail polish formula is a new-ish contender in the world of manicures—but what is it? Polygel is a hybridized formula that borrows the strength of acrylic nails and combines it with the elasticity of a builder gel, giving it a similar flexibility to gel nails. The formula itself comes out in a toothpaste-like tube and can be applied directly to the nail. The polygel is then molded to the desired length and shape before being cured under a UV lamp.

When you’re shopping for a kit, make sure it has a range of polygel shades that you like, as well as a base coat, top coat, and slip or alcohol solution. Look for a UV or LED light for curing—either is fine, but LED lights are more intense and have a slightly quicker drying time.

      "content": "File your nails to smooth out any rough edges. Trim your nails, then take a soft-grit nail file and hold it perpendicular to the edge of your nail. File in single strokes along the grain of your nail, avoiding any type of sawing motion. Adjust the angle of your nail file to achieve a rounded shape, and make sure that any ragged edges are completely smoothed out. [3] X Research source It’s best to visit a professional nail tech for polygel nails. Visiting a pro is safer for your nails, plus it’s more likely that your manicure will turn out better and last for longer! However, if you feel confident that you can apply polygel yourself, you can continue through this set of steps. [4] X Research source"

Dip the brush into the bottle, then neatly paint it onto each of your nails. This solution helps the polygel to move around on your nail without it sticking to your brush before curing.

Use the included brush to spread the polygel evenly across your nail. Then, use the same brush to carefully sculpt the polygel into your desired shape. Remember that the polygel won’t harden until you cure it, so take all the time you need for sculpting! [7] X Research source"

Once the formula is fully cured, you can carefully cut or file your nails to further shape and smooth them out. Proceed gently so as not to break the polygel, and continue until you’re fully happy with the look of your nails."

If you got your nails done by a professional at a salon, it’s advised to return to that salon to have your polygel removed—this approach is the least likely to damage your nails. If you used an at-home nail kit , however, you can follow the removal directions indicated on the package. Typically, polygel nail removal is done either with acetone or by filing down the nail (or a combination of both): [10] X Research source Acetone Removal: Cut off any excess polygel with nail clippers and file down the shiny top coat with a nail file. Then, soak your nails in a bowl of acetone for 10-15 minutes and gently scrape away the loosened gel with a cuticle pusher . Buff away any residue with a nail file. Filing Removal: Cut off any excess polygel with nail clippers, then use a 100-grit nail file (or an e-file on low speed) to remove all but a thin layer of polygel. Use a buffing block or nail file to remove the final layer of polygel."

While the price of polygel nails will vary based on your location, salon reputation, tech experience, design complexity, and more, a full set typically runs from $60-$150. When you go to get your nails redone every 2-3 weeks, these fills usually cost between $45 and $80. [11] X Research source At-home polygel nail kits are considered more cost-effective, which is part of why they’re so popular. Depending on the quality and size of the nail kit, they can range in price from about $15 to $45."

      "title": "Pros of polygel include fewer chemicals, less damage, and more creativity.",
      "content": "Pros of polygel include fewer chemicals, less damage, and more creativity. Unlike acrylic nails, polygel is not harmful to inhale because it doesn’t contain as many harmful chemicals (like monomers) as traditional formulas. Therefore, it’s generally considered to be safer for both nail technicians and clients. [12] X Research source Also, polygel nails that are correctly applied and removed have less potential to damage natural nails than acrylics do. They don’t have to be filed down quite as much as acrylics, and they’re made from a lighter material than acrylics and hard gels. Therefore, polygel nails place less stress on the natural nail. And, perhaps most importantly, polygel nails give you more room to play with shape and style! The formula can be formed into whatever shape you please, and it can continue to be tweaked until it is placed under the gel lamp."

      "title": "Cons of polygel include the cost, UV exposure, and general upkeep.",
      "content": "Cons of polygel include the cost, UV exposure, and general upkeep. First of all, polygel nails tend to cost slightly more than acrylic and gel nails. Plus, they grow out after just a few weeks, so it’s important to get them filled in if you'd like to maintain the look. As a result, the repeated cost of getting the nails done by a professional can add up and become inconvenient. Also, polygel nails need UV or LED lights to cure. After prolonged exposure, these lights can be harmful and potentially cause aging skin or skin cancer.

Plus, their formula can be more easily shaped, leading to more fun and creative options for a manicure. [14] X Research source When compared to acrylics, polygel nails don’t last as long and aren’t quite as durable. However, polygel is lighter weight and won't harden right away like acrylics do, so nail techs have time to shape and style the nail to perfection before curing."
