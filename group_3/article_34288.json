      "content": "Understand the difference between echo and echo -e . echo without the -e prints whatever you type. Try typing echo \"Hello\\n\" : it will print Hello\\n . echo -e , however, will use special symbols if you put the correct letters or numbers after a backslash. Try typing echo -e \"Hello\\n\" : it will print the word Hello and a new, empty line."

      "content": "Understand the form of escape sequences. Escape sequences are what you'll use to format your text. Every escape sequence begins with the ESC character. It is not visible and not on the keyboard. But you can still enter it with a backslash and the correct number: since this character is ASCII 27, you can write it either as \\033 (octal) or \\x1b (hexadecimal). The ESC character is followed by a [ . This square bracket marks the beginning of the actual sequence. After the [ are the numbers and letters that actually decide how a text will be coloured and formatted. You can use multiple codes at once, for example, to make a text bold and red at the same time. The different numbers and letters are then separated by a ; . The last letter is an m . It marks the end of the escape sequence."
