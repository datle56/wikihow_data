      "title": "Check the shower drain for screws.",
      "content": "Check the shower drain for screws. Some shower drains are attached with screws while others are tightened in without them. If any screws are present, use a screwdriver to loosen each screw. [1] X Research source Be careful not to drop any screws down the drain. Set them aside somewhere safe and outside of the shower in case you will be putting the shower drain back in later."

      "title": "Twist the drain counterclockwise with two pliers.",
      "content": "Twist the drain counterclockwise with two pliers. Hold a pair of nose pliers in each hand—you will need two separate sets to remove the drain. Locate the drain openings on opposite sides of the drain, and place the pointed ends of 2 nose pliers in the openings. Carefully twist both handles to the left as you begin loosening the drain. [2] X Research source Handle the pliers carefully so that you don't accidentally dent your shower drain."

      "title": "Continue twisting the drain until it is entirely loosened.",
      "content": "Continue twisting the drain until it is entirely loosened. When you reach the end of the screwed portion of the shower drain, it can be lifted out of the drain hole. Lifting the drain requires a strong grip and focus, so twist the drain slightly to the right (which should re-tighten it) until you are ready to lift it out. [3] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Grasp both of your pliers firmly and lift the shower drain out of the hole.",
      "content": "Grasp both of your pliers firmly and lift the shower drain out of the hole. Lift the drain slowly to avoid denting or otherwise damaging the drain. If you feel any snags or resistance, your drain may be overly-clogged or rusty. [4] X Research source Keep your grip consistent as you lift the drain out. Hold the drain too tightly and you may break the cover. You may lose your grip and have to start over if you hold it too loosely. If you know that you plan on discarding the shower drain, you may handle it more roughly."

      "title": "Inspect the drain after removal.",
      "content": "Inspect the drain after removal. If your shower is clogged and you had planned on replacing the drain, check it for dirt, rust, or clogged items. In some cases, you may be able to repair the drain. Try unclogging, cleaning, or removing rust from the drain before you discard it. [5] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Replace the drain if you cannot repair it.",
      "content": "Replace the drain if you cannot repair it. In some cases, the rust or other damage may be too severe to fix. Contact a plumber or home repair professional to determine what size or brand you will need to replace your old drain and install it in your shower. [6] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Lift the drain up and turn it counterclockwise.",
      "content": "Lift the drain up and turn it counterclockwise. If you have a push-pop drain, apply pressure to force the drain to pop up. If it’s a manual drain cover, lift it up. Then, twist the entire cover counterclockwise. It should twist by hand, but if it doesn’t, use pliers. [7] X Research source Don’t just twist the little knob on the top if you have one. It may come off, but you need to twist the disc underneath the knob."

    {
      "title": "Pull the drain out once you feel a lot of resistance.",
      "content": "Pull the drain out once you feel a lot of resistance. Keep twisting the drain cover counterclockwise until you feel resistance. Once you do, firmly pull up on the drain to remove it from the shower drain. The pop-up’s stem may come out in one piece, or it may remain in the drain. If the drain doesn’t come out, don’t worry. There’s probably a fastener holding it in place."

      "title": "Unscrew the pop-up with a screwdriver if it won’t come out by hand.",
      "content": "Unscrew the pop-up with a screwdriver if it won’t come out by hand. Some higher-end drains have a screw connecting the drain cover to the stem underneath so that the two don’t come loose over time. If the drain won’t come up and you feel resistance when you tug up, look directly under the drain for a screw. If you find one, grab a screwdriver and remove the screw to pull the plug out. [8] X Research source Most of these drains are designed so the screw doesn’t come out all the way to unlock the drain. However, it’s best to use a screwdriver with a magnetic tip just so you don’t lose the fastener."

      "title": "Use pliers to pull out the central stem if it doesn’t come out the top.",
      "content": "Use pliers to pull out the central stem if it doesn’t come out the top. Often, the drain stem that collects all the gunk and hair that ends up in the drain will come out with the cover. If it doesn’t though, use a set of pliers to firmly and slowly pull the stem out. [9] X Research source If you’ve been struggling with clogs, the hair and gunk around the central stem are very likely to be the primary culprit. Clean this drain stem by hand before reinstalling it with the cap."

      "title": "Purchase a drain lubricant to loosen the shower drain.",
      "content": "Purchase a drain lubricant to loosen the shower drain. An older drain may not readily come out even after it has been unscrewed. Buy a drain or spray lubricant, like WD-40, silicone lubricant, or PTFE. If your drain is rusty, WD-40 is ideal. [10] X Research source Do not pour grease or fat down your drain in an attempt to loosen it."

      "content": "Check your drain for clogs before you loosen it. If your drain is significantly clogged, you may want to unclog it as much as you can before removing the drain to prevent it from snagging. Turn on your shower or bathtub head to inspect its draining abilities and, if it appears clogged, try one of the following unclogging methods: [11] X Research source Send a handful of baking soda and hot water down the drain. Pour 1 cup (8 oz) of vinegar and hot water down the drain. Use a drain snake to clean out any blockages."

      "content": "Coat the shower drain in the lubricant. Apply a generous amount of the shower lubricant on and around the shower drain. Pour some lubricant down the drain as well to reach as much of the drain as possible. Let it sit for 5-10 minutes before further loosening the drain. [13] X Research source"
