It does not mean that you are weak if you do stay quiet, you are actually being acting bigger because you can. Save your energy for productive conversations, not petty arguments. Sometimes the thing your cousin does that bugs you will go away quicker if you don't say anything. Often people will realize that they are being annoying later. If you don't say anything, it is more likely that they will realize they were being annoying."

[2] X Research source If you are communicating to your cousin that you are annoyed with him or her, it may make them react worse. Be a big person, do not mutter under your breath, roll your eyes, make faces at other people, or bang things on the table. This shows that you are annoyed."

Your cousin will probably not stop doing what you are annoyed with if you respond negatively. Think about why your cousin is doing this thing? If you can think about the context of what is going on in their life, perhaps it will help you have more compassion toward them. Ask yourself, what good will fighting with him or her over this particular situation get us tomorrow or in a month?"

Use your headphones to block out the noise, and listen to music that you like. Be careful not to overuse your breaks or your headphones. If you stay tuned out all of the time it will damage your relationship with your cousin."

Sometimes if you can find a way to engage in a positive way with your cousin, then you won't have such a bad experience with your cousin. [4] X Trustworthy Source Michigan State University Extension Extension program of Michigan State University focused on community outreach, education, and engagement Go to source Create a gentle pause in the situation or conversation. Say something like, \"Hey, I have a question.\" Then wait a couple of seconds before starting. Acknowledge the thing your cousin is doing. Don't bring attention to the fact that it is annoying, instead be matter of fact about it. Say, \"I see that you are playing your video games, but I was curious about what you are doing this weekend with your friends. I wanted to know who is going to grandmas and if you will bring anyone.\""

Your patterns of thought may be making you to believe things about your cousin that are your own ideas and not truly who they are. These thoughts can be dangerous for your relationship with your cousin because they will make you more bitter, upset and angry with your cousin. Once you start to notice yourself dwelling on all of the things that your cousin does that you don't like, do something to distract yourself. Listen to some music, read something, talk to someone or do something."

It is easy to think that you know what is going on because you are very familiar with that person. However, you may still need more information to understand a situation. For example, you might think \"I know he is being loud just to get on my nerves\". But, there may be something else going on with them. Maybe they are being loud while they play video games because they had a bad day at school. The next time you find yourself assuming that you know why your cousin is doing something, ask them about it instead. Say \"Why do you say that?\""

They like to hear about what is going on with you, too. Laugh with your cousin. Make fun of each other or laugh at the things that happen to you.

[8] X Research source Give real examples of how you cause the problem too. For example, you can say \"I know that I hurt you when I told you that you were not good enough for the basketball team.\" Apologize and own what you did. For example, tell your cousin \"I am sorry. I was angry, and I shouldn't have said that.\" Tell them the things you will do differently in the future. You can say, \"I am going to think about what I have to say before I blurt out when I am angry.\" If you have lots of examples of how your cousin is the problem but have no similar examples of how you also have done things to hurt the situation, it will make your cousin less likely to believe that you are being sincere."

For example, you can say \"when you don't tell me the truth it makes me feel like I can't trust you.\" Avoid sounding judgemental. You can be clear, but you do not have to sound judgemental.
