If you throw a dart that lands in the larger areas on the board, you score the points for that section. [1] X Research source Dartboards may vary in color, but the single scoring spaces are usually white and black or red and black. The numbers are laid out in the same order on every dartboard."

If you throw a dart that lands in the outer ring for the section, you score twice as many points.

When your dart hits this inner ring, multiply the section number by 3 to get your score. [3] X Research source Example: If you land inside the triple ring in the 18 section, you score 54 points. Hitting the triple 20 and earning 60 points is the highest score you can reach with a single dart."

The inner section (usually red) is called the \"double bull\" or \"cork,\" and the outer section (usually green) is known as the \"single bull\" or just \"bull.\" [4] X Research source Hitting the out section of the bullseye is worth 25 points. Getting a perfect double bullseye is worth 50 points."

Whenever you’re about to throw a dart , position yourself at the oche and be careful not to cross it. [5] X Research source It’s okay for your arms and upper body to cross over the oche, but your feet must stay behind it."

Put your front foot up to the oche and shift your weight slightly forward so you stay balanced. Keep the ball of your back foot planted on the ground to keep you stable. [6] X Research source For right-handed players, keep your right foot in front and your left foot in back. For left-handed players, keep your left foot in front and your right foot in back. Avoid leaning forward or backward too far because it can make you lose your balance."

Follow through so your fingers point down toward the ground after your throw. [9] X Research source Darts do not need a great deal of force to stick into the dartboard, so avoid trying to throw them hard. If you throw them too hard, you could break the tips. Try to keep your body as still and balanced as possible throughout your throw so you have the most control."

Once you’re close to 0, you must end the game by hitting a double that brings you to 0. If you go below 0, then reset your points to whatever you had at the start of the round. [12] X Research source Example: If you have 19 points left, you could hit a single 1 to bring your total to 18 and then hit the double 9 to win the game. Once you get your score below 171, it’s possible to win the game in a single turn, however, this is dependent on your points until you reach over 158 as at that point you can win the game in a single turn. For example, if you have 170 points, you can go out by hitting the triple 20 twice and then the inner ring of the bullseye."

After the third hit, put a circle around the X to “close it out.” [13] X Research source If you hit the outer ring in a section, then it counts as 2 hits. If you hit the inner ring, it counts as 3 hits and immediately closes out that section. The outer ring on the bullseye counts as 1 hit and the inner ring counts as 2 hits. You can aim for the numbered sections in any order. It’s usually best to try aiming for 19, 20, and the bullseye first because they’re more high-valued."
