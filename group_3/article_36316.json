      "title": "Keep the skin clean and moisturized.",
      "content": "Keep the skin clean and moisturized. Good skin care is essential in the treatment of any skin condition, and keloids are no exception. Keeping your skin clean and moisturized will encourage skin rejuvenation — this means that the older, scarred skin will be sloughed away and replaced with the newer, smoother layers underneath. Wash the scarred skin at least once a day (twice if it's on your face) with a gentle cleanser that contains no colors or fragrances. Be sure not to over wash the skin, however, as this can dry it out and cause irritation. Moisturize the skin after cleansing to keep it hydrated. You can use a gentle store-bought moisturizer or apply a natural oil such as coconut or olive oil. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Wear suntan lotion every day to avoid damaging the skin.",
      "content": "Wear suntan lotion every day to avoid damaging the skin. Scarred skin is particularly sensitive, making it prone to burning and hyperpigmentation caused by the harmful rays of the sun. As a result, it is important to apply suntan lotion to keloid scars if you intend to spend any time outside throughout the day. Use a high SPF of thirty or above, and remember to apply it to the skin at least thirty minutes before going outside. The sun's rays can be damaging on the skin, even when it's not hot or sunny outside. Therefore, it's important to apply suntan lotion regardless of the weather."

      "title": "Don't pick at the scars.",
      "content": "Don't pick at the scars. When you have a cut or small scar on the skin, it can be very tempting to pick at it. However, this is a bad idea as it often leads to infection and the formation of keloid scars. Try to leave any cuts alone to prevent the formation of keloids and avoid touching any existing keloids, as this can simply aggravate them further. If you leave your scars alone, there's a good chance that they will disappear on their own over time, without the need for medical intervention."

      "content": "Apply lemon juice to lighten scars. You can apply lemon juice to darker scars in order to lighten them. Vitamin C is important in normal wound healing, and the high concentration of vitamin C in lemon juice can help lighten scars. [5] X Research source Moores, J. (2013). Vitamin C: a wound healing perspective. British Journal Of Community Nursing, 18S6-s11. Use a cotton ball soaked in lemon juice and apply directly to the scar. Allow the lemon juice to air dry and rinse with warm water. Repeat once a day. Be aware that exposing the lemon-juice treated skin to sunlight may result in bleaching. While most steps described later in this method can be used in conjunction, do not try mixing lemon juice with other remedies. If you want to use other methods that you apply to the scar concurrently, then rinse off the lemon juice and wait two to three hours beforehand."

      "title": "Use castor oil to break down scar tissue and detoxify the skin.",
      "content": "Use castor oil to break down scar tissue and detoxify the skin. Castor oil has the ability to penetrate deep into the skin and slowly break down scar tissue. In healthy skin cells, it helps to increase circulation and eliminate toxins. To treat keloids, soak a piece of clean cloth in castor oil and press it onto the keloid for an hour or two every day. Alternatively, you can just rub castor oil directly onto the keloid everyday. You may also use castor oil to prevent keloid formation in the first place by applying the oil directly onto cuts or scrapes. This promotes better healing."

[6] X Research source Topical Application of Aloe vera Accelerated Wound Healing, Modeling, and Remodeling: An Experimental Study With Significant Clinical Value. Aloe vera is an anti-inflammatory herb. The reduction of inflammation, especially during the early stages of scar formation may be important for increasing the elasticity of the new tissue."

This is usually only proposed for keloids more than one year old since the tissue can often flatten by itself over this time period. Excision of the keloid would result in a fresh wound that requires specific care to help avoid the potential for another keloid developing.
