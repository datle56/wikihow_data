The most romantic messages are genuine, simple, and straightforward in letting your partner know exactly why you love them . Just remember that romance can be as simple as seeing something “that reminds you of the other person and letting them know that you were thinking about them,” comments Wagner. “Maybe you’re driving by a restaurant that you had an amazing date at, and you simply send a text like ‘I just drove by that place and was thinking about the night we had. Just wanted to say I love you.’” Here are some other romantic “reasons why I love you” messages : You make me feel like I’m the only person in the world. When we’re together, all my problems disappear. You have the smoothest skin. I could spend hours just watching and caressing it. You’re always there for me, no matter what. You make me feel like I can get through anything, as long as I have you. Because you are so sexy and I can’t believe I get to call you mine. You kiss me goodbye when I’m still asleep in the morning.

      "content": "Compile a list of 100+ reasons that you love someone. If you want to put together a list of reasons that you love your partner, start by drafting the list itself. Make a numbered list from 1-100 (or more!), either on your computer or on paper. Then, start writing all of the reasons that you love your partner ; include a range of funny and serious reasons, as well as a range of specific and more general ideas. You can start listing ideas based on just what you think of in your own head. Then, borrow some from this article (yay!) or use them as inspiration for coming up with “reasons” of your own. Why should you write this list for your partner? Well, maybe you just feel like doing it, or maybe you’ve been feeling disconnected in your relationship lately. According to Carmichael, “when we do behavioral activities towards a goal, our brain assumes that that goal must be important.” “So if you work backwards by just making some behavioral investments toward the goal of being with your spouse and trying to win them over again,” continues Carmichael, “that can actually awaken the part of you that is goal-oriented about the relationship.”"
