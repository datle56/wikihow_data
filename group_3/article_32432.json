Use a hammer and chisel to break off the damaged stucco and lath from the sheathing of the wall, but you must leave some lath around the damaged area, as the new lath will be tied to the old. The stucco should fall off fairly easily. If you wet down the wall, it will reduce the dust that comes off at this step."

      "content": "Cut a piece of the double D tar paper. Cut it as big as the uncovered portion of the lath. Use the hammer tacker to stick the piece on the sheathing. [3] X Research source It is best to have the new piece go behind the old tar paper at the top (so if any moisture gets inside the wall, it will run out and away from the wood) and to have the new tar paper in front of the old tar paper at the bottom (so that is any moisture gets in the wall, it will run outside, away from the wood). Use as few staples as possible because holes in the tar paper can let water in."

In that case, tack a few staples in or improvise in order to keep it in place. Instead of rubber membrane, which is quite expensive, you can use a tube of Polyurethane sealer, which costs less and was used by builders for this purpose prior to the invention of rubber membrane."

This will permit you to mix the stucco less so that you can work with it longer."
