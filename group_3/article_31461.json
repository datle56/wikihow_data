      "content": "Crafting an Instagram post is like baking a cake—you want to use the perfect blend of ingredients to achieve the ideal aesthetic. So what are the ingredients that go into an amazing #OOTD or photo dump? Your photo choices, your trendy hashtags, your humble-brag geo-location, and, of course, your amazing caption! But writing the perfect caption for your post is more difficult than one might think, which is why we’ve assembled these expert tips on the subject: Keep your caption quick and catchy. “You really want to captivate the audience to either read more of a lengthy caption or look more at what’s in the post itself,” says Dunn. “If it’s not catchy, it’ll be hard to keep them intrigued.” Brainstorm multiple captions. Come up with “five or six different captions and then take them from there,” advises Gasper. “It’s good to plan ahead.” Make your caption relevant. “I always see what’s going on in the world right now,” says Gasper. “For example, Taylor Swift is huge in pop culture right now. So, maybe you utilize something from her lyrics that might be applicable to your product or post.” Only quote from someone who matches your vibe. If you want your post to come off as classy, for instance, Gasper recommends “looking up a quote from Chanel, Karl Lagerfeld, Dior, Jackie Kennedy, or another notable figure who’s known for being very classy, elegant, and regal.”"
