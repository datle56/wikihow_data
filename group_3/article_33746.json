Some of the more important pieces of reddiquette include: Be courteous. Other commenters and posters are human just like you. Consider what you would say if you confronted this person face-to-face before posting. Vote on other people’s comments and submissions. Make sure that you only use the downvote option for content or comments that don't fit the subreddit or don't add anything to the conversation. Don't downvote simply because you don't agree with the other person. Make thoughtful posts, stay abreast of new posts, and link to outside sources responsibly. Meaning, you should contribute to the conversation at hand in a meaningful manner. Redditors do not take kindly to blatant spam or self-promotion. If you are upfront about what your link is, and it contributes to the conversation and is applicable, then by all means post. Blatant self-promotion or attempts to garner traffic are usually not met favorably. Let people know why you edited your comment. It is common courtesy to explain why your post has been edited, as everyone can see which posts have been edited. Don't be intentionally rude. Reddit strives to foster an active community, and rudeness undermines that. Don't start or participate in trolling and flame wars, which are attacks on other users without contributing to the discussion."
