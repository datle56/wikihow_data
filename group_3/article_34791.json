      "content": "Insert the valve stem into the wheel if there isn't one present. You'll need a valve stem to inflate the tire once it's mounted. There will be one hole on the interior of the rim that passes all the way through to the outside.To install the valve stem , lubricate the valve stem with a bit of tire lubricant , then press it into the hole on the inner portion of the rim where the tire will later cover. Next, take a pair of pliers and pull the valve stem outward from the hole. [1] X Research source Pull the stem until it's snugly seated in its hole in the rim. The design of the valve stem won't allow it to pass all the way through or pop out in any direction other than backward, so all you need to do is ensure it's pulled through the hole and is seated tightly."

      "content": "Lubricate the tire bead and rim generously. Fleischmann puts it simply: “Use lots of lubricant.” [2] X Expert Source Howard Fleischmann Automotive Tire & Repair Specialist Expert Interview. 4 June 2021. Apply tire lubricant to the inner lip of the tire (referred to as the bead) and the outer edge of the rim with a tire lubricant brush —just saturate the brush and then swipe it along the bead and rim. Or, you can spray the lubricant on. [3] X Research source Make sure the entire top and bottom beads on the tire and the entire edge on the rim are both well lubricated. Reapply more lubricant as necessary. If you don’t have tire lubricant, some DIYers recommend spraying a mix of water and dish soap (or just plain dish soap) or Windex. However, professional-quality tire lubricant is the safest for your tires. Soapy water can cause corrosion over time."

If the ground you're working on is blacktop or concrete, place a piece of cardboard beneath the wheel to avoid scratching it. Make sure the surface you work on is flat, even, and stable. [4] X Research source The tire will sit on top of the rim, with its bottom bead meeting the rim's upper lip."

      "content": "Step on the tire with both feet to press the lower bead onto the rim. Slide part of the bottom bead under the rim with your hands, then step on top of the tire. Apply pressure to all sides and force the bottom bead of the tire down over the top lip of the rim. [5] X Research source You may need to hop a bit to apply enough downward force to push the tire bead over the lip. Ask a friend to lend a hand for balance as you step up onto the tire on one side, if needed. Alternatively, slide the lower bead of the tire onto the rim at an angle with your hands. You might be able to slip the entire bead on this way, or you may still have to step on the tire to get the full bead in place."

      "content": "Add more lubricant to the upper bead on the tire as well as the rim. With the lower bead seated, the real challenge will be getting the upper one to follow suit. Apply more lubricant to help force the rubber down over the metal to make it a bit easier. [6] X Research source The bottom bead won't need any more lubricant."

Press down on the lower portion of the tire if it doesn't quite make it past the lip on its own. [7] X Research source You'll need to create enough space between the upper bead of the tire and upper lip of the rim to slide a pry bar into the gap. You may even need to use the pry bar to create the gap. If so, keep it in place once you're done."

      "content": "Use a pry bar to force the tire's lip over the rest of the rim. Move around the wheel, pressing down onto the tire with your hands and prying the bead over the upper lip of the rim. This will take a fair amount of work, but should be done by the time you make it all the way around the wheel once. [8] X Research source Press the pry bar into the bottom side of the rim's upper lip, so it is not scratching any visible metal on the rim. When you make it all the way around the wheel, both the tire's upper and lower beads should be completely past the rim's lip. No pry bar? Lay the tire flat and walk on top of it to force the bead underneath the rim of the wheel. However, Fleischmann warns that “if you don't have the right tools, you're going to destroy the bead on the tire…and create another very unsafe condition. But, if you've got the right tools, you can get the bead over the rim.” [9] X Expert Source Howard Fleischmann Automotive Tire & Repair Specialist Expert Interview. 4 June 2021."

Once both beads of the tire are past the rim's lip, attach an air compressor hose to the valve stem and inflate the tire . Keep your fingers and clothing clear of the tire bead as the tire inflates. [10] X Research source You may hear 1 or 2 popping noises as the tire inflates. This is the sound of the bead sealing against the rim and is a good thing. Once the tire is inflated, you can move on to the next one."

      "content": "Take the tire and wheel to get balanced. Once the tire is on and inflated, visit a mechanic to get your wheel assembly balanced. During tire balancing, a mechanic will add wheel weights so that the rim and tire’s center of gravity matches that of the entire wheel assembly. This reduces vibrations from the wheels while you drive. [11] X Research source Tip: It's best if you don't drive on the wheel before it's balanced, but you can drive a short distance to a mechanic for balancing if you need to (just maintain a moderate speed). Driving more than 2 months with unbalanced wheels can damage your suspension system and cause vibrations that make controlling the vehicle difficult. [12] X Research source It’s recommended that most drivers have their tires balanced about every 6,000 miles (9,656 km)."

Spray the tire lubricant liberally onto the inner lip of the tire (referred to as the bead) as well as the outer edge of the rim to make it easier to seat the tire on the rim to be inflated. If your lubricant came in a jar rather than a spray bottle, apply the lubricant to the same edges using a cloth or wooden dowel. [13] X Research source Don't use dish soap or automotive grease instead of lubricant. The dish soap does not offer enough lubrication and grease can be extremely difficult to clean off of the wheel. You can purchase tire lubricant at your local auto parts store."

Set it on the machine and engage the hydraulic press that secures the rim in place from beneath by pressing the corresponding pedal. [16] X Research source Most tire machines have two pedals: one to engage the press and another to rotate the rim. If you're unsure which pedal is which (or if there is no pedal on your particular machine), refer to the tire machine owner's manual or the manufacturer's website for guidance."

The tire should be able to sit on its own without falling off the rim. [17] X Research source It's important to start with one bead beneath the rim's edge and enough space for the mounting arm to be slid into the gap created by the angle."

      "content": "Swing the machine’s mounting arm down near the edge of the rim. Position the mounting arm so it makes contact with the rim's outer edge in the same spot you've already angled the tire to get past. If you can't squeeze the mounting arm in at that spot, re-adjust the tire to give yourself room to get the mounting arm in. [18] X Research source Use the adjustment knob to position the arm just barely off of the rim so they’re not touching. This reduces the risk of damaging the rim while you use the machine. The mounting arm serves as a sort of pry bar to force the rest of the tire over the lip of the rim, so it needs to start in a place where the tire has already made it past that lip."

      "content": "Angle the tire so the lower bead is aimed at the mounting arm. With the mounting arm in place, you may need to adjust the tire slightly so that it comes into contact with the arm as the wheel and tire rotate. In most cases, this won't require an adjustment at this point, but look things over to ensure the proper angle. Make sure the tire is positioned so that the arm presses the lip down past the rim's edge as it rotates. [19] X Research source Often, the way the tire sits on the rim to allow for the mounting arm is already at the right angle. If the tire falls off the rim, it's not angled properly."

Continue to rotate the two until they complete one full circle and the tire's bottom bead is entirely past the top lip of the rim. [20] X Research source The tire will look like it's halfway mounted when you're done, with most of the tire on the rim. The tire's top bead will be all that stops it from settling all the way onto the wheel."

Just like before, press one side of the tire down with your hands until it dips beneath the upper lip of the rim, then lower the mounting arm down onto the rim's edge in the space you've created by hand. [21] X Research source You may need to use a pry bar to press the tire's top bead down over the lip of the rim in that spot. The tire will once again sit at an angle once the mounting arm is lowered into place."

Once you complete one full circle, both the tire's upper and lower beads will be passed the rim's upper lip. [22] X Research source If needed, use your knuckles (not your fingers) to press the tire down as it rotates to make sure the bead stays under the rim. The tire is now effectively on the rim and just needs to be inflated."

Connect the air compressor hose to the end of the valve stem you installed earlier, but make sure you get your hands and clothing completely clear of the tire before you turn the compressor on. Once you start the flow of air, the tire will rapidly inflate. [23] X Research source Any piece of your body or clothing caught in the space between the tire bead and rim's edge will get pinched as the tire expands under inflation. Once inflated to the proper air pressure, the tire is mounted. After the tire is on and inflated, balance the tire to make sure it’s working its best."
