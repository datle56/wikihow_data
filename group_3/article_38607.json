      "content": "Look for the color first. The sign of a good quality, ripe custard apple is a pale green tone across the fruit. This indicates it is ready to eat. If the fruit is a darker green, this indicates that it is unripe; [1] X Research source it is still good to buy but needs ripening at home. African Pride may have a light yellow tinge as well as pale green. [2] X Research source Avoid fruit that has black or purple coloring, as it is no longer fresh and may even be rotten. There is a new late-fruiting variety of custard apple that has a pink skin. [3] X Research source It is known as Pinks Blush. If you're lucky enough to find this unusual variety (Australia only currently), it will have a pink skin rather than light green."

However, allow it to stand for at least 5 minutes after removing it from the refrigerator before eating it. This will ensure that its flavor is best. Depending on the variety of custard apple, you can cut the fruit in and half and either scoop the flesh out with a spoon or pull apart and take out pieces of the fruit and eat by hand. The creamier the flesh, the more likely it is you'll need to use a spoon for scooping it out. The seeds are inedible; remove these before eating."
