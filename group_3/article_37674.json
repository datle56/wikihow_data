      "title": "RNG is an acronym for Random Number Generator.",
      "content": "RNG is an acronym for Random Number Generator. In the computer programming world (especially in video game development), RNG is a technique used to keep players on their toes. In a video game like League of Legends , for instance, RNG is used in the background to determine when players land critical hits (attacks that deal a higher concentration of damage). In the digital card game Hearthstone , RNG can take center stage, as players can use cards that generate random effects. [1] X Research source The amount of RNG in a game really draws the line between random chance and any player’s given skill level. Players who love the unpredictability of RNG might love games that heavily rely on its function, like the Mario Party franchise."

      "title": "RNG is also used as a slang word that means “lucky.”",
      "content": "RNG is also used as a slang word that means “lucky.” If someone has “good” RNG, it means that they’re experiencing a lot of luck (especially in a video game). Conversely, someone who has “bad” RNG is experiencing some bad luck. The word is often used to discuss video games. “I started a new Minecraft world, but I’ve had some pretty terrible RNG.” “I love Baldur’s Gate 3 , but I’ve also had some crazy good RNG. I rolled three 20s in a row somehow.”"

      "title": "Use RNG to highlight a person’s good or bad luck.",
      "content": "Use RNG to highlight a person’s good or bad luck. RNG is best known among the gaming community, so it makes the most sense to use it when discussing a video game (or someone’s performance in a video game). Less tech-savvy individuals might not know what RNG means, so use it mindfully! “My Genshin RNG is garbage. It took me 80 pulls to get a 5-star.” “Your Fortnite RNG is insanely good, dude. I can’t believe you lasted that long!” You can even use RNG in an ironic sense to discuss topics unrelated to video games. If you get pulled over by a cop, for example, you could blame it on “bad RNG.”"

      "content": "Discuss video game mechanics with the word RNG. RNG is an important factor in a wide variety of video games, and will likely come up in conversation if you discuss a game’s mechanics enough. Make your commentary sound a little more authoritative by sprinkling “RNG” into your vernacular. “I think you might like Rocket League . There’s almost no RNG involved.” “Not gonna lie, Borderlands 2 has a really nice balance of RNG. I really enjoyed my playthrough.”"

      "title": "RNG has existed throughout history.",
      "content": "RNG has existed throughout history. While modern RNG is typically associated with video games, RNG devices have existed for an extremely long time. Think of gambling/betting tools like a pair of dice—these devices invoke a sense of unpredictability by “randomly” picking a number from a set."

      "title": "Computerized RNG isn’t actually RNG.",
      "content": "Computerized RNG isn’t actually RNG. In the programming field, the technology used in random number generators allows wiggle room for predictability (since equations and algorithms are often used in computerized RNG). Because of this, “Pseudo Random Number Generator” (PRNG) is technically a more accurate term, though it’s not used as slang."

      "title": "RNG can play a huge role in the speedrunning community.",
      "content": "RNG can play a huge role in the speedrunning community. Speedrunning involves completing a video game as fast as possible. RNG naturally can play a huge role in a speedrunner’s success, especially if the game they’re playing relies heavily on it. In some cases, it’s hard for a speedrunner to improve upon a high-scoring run if good RNG factored into their success. [2] X Research source For example, a Minecraft speedrun can be heavily impacted by RNG, since new Minecraft worlds are created using random number sequences known as “seeds” (though players can input a specific seed # to generate a specific world). [3] X Research source A player could end up lucky and find a lot of valuable resources right away, or struggle to find anything good at first."
