      "content": "Peacocking is when someone shows off in order to impress someone. When people peacock, they purposely make themselves appear more desirable or attractive. They may put extra effort into their appearance by dressing up or they may show off their talents or accomplishments. This flirtatious behavior is most common in men trying to attract women, but women can display it, as well. [1] X Research source Someone may peacock to get someone else’s number, land a date, find a partner, or even score a one-night stand. The term “peacocking” comes from the mating behavior of male peacocks spreading their feathers to attract a female peacock. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Peacocking may be slightly different in men and women. While the act of peacocking for men and women ultimately has the same goal (to attract or impress someone), how a man or woman gets to that goal may differ. In men, peacocking may be more obvious. [3] X Research source In women, it tends to be more subdued and subtle. For instance, a man might peacock at the gym by taking off his shirt and flexing in the mirror. On the other hand, a woman may peacock at the gym by giggling with a friend while pointing at someone cute or giving someone she finds attractive a compliment."

      "content": "Peacocking isn’t inherently bad. Peacocking is a social behavior for both people and animals. However, some people view it as obnoxious or vain, and doing too much of it could be abrasive or arrogant, especially if two people try to out-peacock the other. This can lead to competition and, in turn, arguments and disagreements. At the end of the day, there’s nothing wrong with peacocking as long as you stay true to yourself, avoid being arrogant, and respect people’s boundaries. Some people think peacocking or showing off is distracting or annoying—just keep in mind that this is a matter of personal opinion."
