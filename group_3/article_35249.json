      "content": "A stem and leaf plot is a chart that helps sort a set of multi-digit numbers. The digit(s) with the highest place value goes in the stem category, while the digit with the lowest place value goes in the leaf category. Stem and leaf plots are great ways to visualize an entire set of data at once. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "The stem column contains digits in the tens or hundreds place.",
      "content": "The stem column contains digits in the tens or hundreds place. The stem column is representative of the first, larger portion of a data point (usually a digit with a place value in the 10s or 100s). For example, if a stem column has the numbers 9, 10, and 11, that means the column is representative of all numbers in the 90s, 100s, and 110s. [3] X Research source You can add a 0 to the stem number to understand what value it conveys."

      "title": "The leaf column contains digits in the ones or tenths place.",
      "content": "The leaf column contains digits in the ones or tenths place. The leaves show the smaller portion of a data point, usually either the ones place or decimal place. If the numbers in the leaf column are 3, 5, and 9 next to a stem number of 8, that means the numbers represented are 83, 85, and 89. [4] X Research source Sometimes, a stem plot will be used to separate numbers with decimals. For example, instead of the stem value being 80+3, it would be 8.0+3, making for a total of 8.3. Reading the plot key should tell you the place values of all the data."

      "content": "Separate your numbers by their starting digits. Once you have all the numbers in your data set written in front of you, draw a line to section off each group of numbers with a different starting digit. For example, put all numbers that start with 1 followed by a single digit (11, 14, 19) in their own section. Put all numbers that start with 2 followed by a single digit (22, 23, 26) in their own section and so on until all numbers are categorized in sets. These sets will become the rows in your stem and leaf plot. [6] X Research source"

Organize these rows with the lowest value at the top and the highest value at the bottom. Double check to ensure you have no repeat numbers. [7] X Research source Numbers in the stem column can contain multiple digits as long as the values in the leaf column are all single digits."

In the leaf column, write the single, remaining digits with the lowest place values next to their corresponding category with commas separating each one. Place each leaf digit next to the digit it stems from. For example, numbers 153, 153, 154, and 156 would have 3, 3, 4, and 6 next to the 15 stem. All numbers from 70-79 would go on the leaf side of 7 and so on. [8] X Research source"
