      "content": "Have fun to take your mind off excitement. Immerse yourself in a challenging video game. Throw a ball to your dog. Go on a bike ride with your younger sibling(s). Watch a whole bunch of funny YouTube videos. Binge-watch that new show on Netflix. Just have some good old-fashioned fun. Channeling your excitement into a positive and fun behavior can be effective at calming you down and distracting you from what's got you all wound up. Those who do not have fun often are actually more likely to experience criminality, obesity, and loss of creativity, researchers say. [1] X Research source Even during times when you are not just looking for a distraction, you should take your playtime just as seriously as you do work time."

      "content": "Complete some chores. Take the opportunity to momentarily forget what's making you so excited by getting your hands dirty and moving. Go home and make a list of household chores or errands that need completing, and get started on them. Rake leaves, mow the lawn, wash the car, do the laundry, dust the ceiling fans -- just keep yourself busy and moving so as to not get caught back up in your excitement. Chores probably don't rank high on your list of distracting things to do. They're not all that fun. Still, much research has been conducted on the benefits of chores. Studies have found that adolescents who perform a set of chores tend to have a higher sense of responsibility, healthier self-esteem, and are more capable of handling frustration.

This may seem like a short amount of time, but not much exercise is required to alleviate stress.

      "content": "Go outside and get some fresh air to change your perspective. Being cooped up inside will make it hard for you to get your mind off what's got you excited.

But, you will also benefit by tiring yourself out physically to fight the over-excitement. Maybe after a fun dance session, you might want to take a short nap."
