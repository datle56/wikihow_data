      "title": "Get 2 bottles, 2 poles, and a frisbee.",
      "content": "Get 2 bottles, 2 poles, and a frisbee. Polish horseshoes is traditionally a drinking game, so beer bottles are typical. Poles are usually around 6 ft (1.8 m) tall, although you might prefer taller poles if you're playing with taller people. As for the frisbee, any kind of frisbee of any size or weight will do. This is the sort of game that's basically designed for you to be able to pull together at the last minute. [1] X Research source While you can buy a polish horseshoes set that includes everything you need, part of the attraction of this game is that you can easily make your own with things you have lying around. Keep in mind that you're going to balance a beer bottle (or similarly sized bottle) on top of the pole. Make sure the end is big enough to accommodate the bottle and low enough that someone can reach to position the bottles."

      "title": "Mark the low height on the pole with tape or a permanent marker.",
      "content": "Mark the low height on the pole with tape or a permanent marker. The defending team has to catch the frisbee after it hits the pole but before it hits the ground. If it hits the pole too close to the ground, it's just not fair—they don't have enough time to even try to catch it. Decide amongst yourselves where you want the fair zone to be. [2] X Research source You might want to play around a little to decide what height you think is fair. For example, you could have someone hold the pole while you lob the frisbee at various heights from a short distance so others can practice catching it. At the same time, decide what's considered out of bounds. If someone flings a frisbee too far away for anyone to catch it, they won't get any points. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Plant your poles in the ground about 25 ft (7.6 m) apart.",
      "content": "Plant your poles in the ground about 25 ft (7.6 m) apart. As with the other aspects of the setup of this game, distances are approximate. The further apart you plant your poles, the harder the game will potentially be—depending on who you're playing with. Pound them at least a little ways into the soil so that they're relatively stable and won't fall over if someone barely taps them. [4] X Research source If you're using a length of PVC pipe for your pole, bury a wooden dowel in the ground and push the pipe down on top of the dowel to secure it. Ski poles are really popular options for DIY poles because the pointed ends easily plant in the ground."
    },
    {
      "title": "Set your empty bottles on top of the poles.",
      "content": "Set your empty bottles on top of the poles. Balance the bottles so they're relatively stable and won't just fall off if there's a strong wind. You might find that you need to plant your poles a little deeper into the ground just so they're a little less precarious. [5] X Research source You can use any kind of bottle! You might want to use plastic water bottles if you're worried about glass beer bottles breaking. You could also use an empty can rather than a bottle if that's what you have available."

    {
      "title": "Choose teams and decide who will throw first.",
      "content": "Choose teams and decide who will throw first. Polish horseshoes is typically played with 2 teams of 2 people. As for who goes first, that's up to whatever method you think is fair, but sometimes it's easiest to just flip a coin. [6] X Research source Decide amongst yourselves how you're going to rotate throwing. You might have one person throwing for the team the whole time or you might alternate. It doesn't really matter as long as everyone agrees ahead of time. You can also play Polish horseshoes as singles, although it can get a bit tricky for one person to try to catch both the frisbee and the bottle. [7] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Throw the frisbee at the pole.",
      "content": "Throw the frisbee at the pole. As the throwing team, your goal is to knock the other team's bottle off of their pole with your frisbee. You can do this by either hitting the bottle directly with the frisbee or destabilizing the bottle by hitting the pole, causing it to fall. You score points when either the bottle or the frisbee hit the ground after the frisbee hits either the pole or the bottle. If you hit the pole below the low height line you marked, you get no points from that throw, even if the bottle falls off and hits the ground. If the frisbee doesn't hit either the bottle or the pole, you don't score any points and the defending team isn't required to catch the frisbee (although they might as well, since they're throwing next)."

    {
      "title": "Defend your pole when the other team throws.",
      "content": "Defend your pole when the other team throws. So the throwing team is trying to knock your bottle off the pole—but they only score points if the bottle or the frisbee hits the ground. If you and your teammate manage to catch both the bottle and the frisbee, your opponents can continue to knock your bottle off all day long and never score a single point. [8] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Continue alternating throws until a team wins.",
      "content": "Continue alternating throws until a team wins. As soon as you catch (or retrieve) the thrown frisbee as the defending team, you become the throwing team. You can throw it immediately if you want, you don't even have to wait. But if you want to be nice, pause for a second and let the other team get ready to defend before you launch that frisbee back in their direction. [9] X Research source Decide how many points you want to play to before you start playing. Most people play to 21, but you might play to a lower or higher number if you want. Typically, you have to win by at least 2 points. This can add a little heat when the score gets close. [10] X Research source This is also a game that you can just play and drink and have fun without even keeping score, so don't stress out too much about trying to remember the score when you're playing. If you're having a good time, everybody wins."

    {
      "title": "Score points when your team is throwing.",
      "content": "Score points when your team is throwing. When you throw the frisbee, you get 1 point if the frisbee falls to the ground after hitting the bottle or the pole, and 2 points if the bottle falls to the ground. The key is that your frisbee has to at least hit the pole for you to earn any points at all. After the frisbee hits the pole, the defending team is allowed to try to catch it before it hits the ground. Playing tip: Take a few practice throws aiming at the pole before the game starts so you'll have a little bit of muscle memory."

    {
      "title": "Earn 0 points if the frisbee doesn't hit the pole.",
      "content": "Earn 0 points if the frisbee doesn't hit the pole. All scoring opportunities occur after the frisbee hits either the pole or the bottle, so if you miss them both, you don't score. [11] X Research source You get the same result if you hit the pole close to the ground, below that line you marked off on the pole. In technical terms, that frisbee is \"uncatchable\" and can't earn any points. Ditto if it flies way out of bounds."
    },
    {
      "title": "Earn 1 extra point if you hit the bottle directly.",
      "content": "Earn 1 extra point if you hit the bottle directly. If you hit the bottle directly, you score 1 point automatically, even if the other player manages to catch the bottle before it hits the ground. Playing tip: Aim for the bottom of the bottle. If you're too low, you'll still hit pretty high up on the pole, making it more likely that the bottle will fall (even though you won't get the guaranteed point for hitting the bottle directly)."
    },
    {
      "title": "Earn 3 points if the defending team interferes with your throw.",
      "content": "Earn 3 points if the defending team interferes with your throw. The defending team isn't allowed to guard or block as a general rule. If they catch the frisbee before it hits the pole, or grab the bottle before it actually falls off the pole, your team is awarded 3 points—the maximum number of points you could have earned if the defending team hadn't interfered with your throw. That ought to keep them from jumping the gun! [12] X Research source Playing tip: Stand behind the pole so you're less likely to get in front of it and interfere with a throw."

    {
      "title": "Make polish horseshoes a drinking game.",
      "content": "Make polish horseshoes a drinking game. Polish horseshoes is a game that tends to involve beer bottles, so it should come as no surprise that you can turn it into a drinking game. Here are some rules you can try, depending on how much you want to drink: [13] X Research source Drink once if the defending team doesn't catch the frisbee Drink twice if the defending team doesn't catch the bottle Chug a beer if you score 3 points at once"
    },
    {
      "title": "Add penalties for throwing short.",
      "content": "Add penalties for throwing short. If you don't throw the frisbee hard enough and it doesn't even make it as far as the other team's pole, you know you don't get any points. But if you feel like that's not bad enough, you can allow the other team to throw the frisbee from the spot where your throw landed. [14] X Research source If you or your teammate have a tendency to throw short, don't suggest this rule—it'll put you at a tremendous disadvantage. The closer you are to the pole, the easier it is to hit the bottle directly."
    },
    {
      "title": "Hold a drink at all times.",
      "content": "Hold a drink at all times. With this added rule, everybody holds a drink in one hand, leaving only one hand free to catch the frisbee or the bottle. Typically there's some sort of game- or drinking-related consequence if anyone spills or drops their drink. [15] X Research source For example, you might have the rule that if anyone spills or drops their drink, their team loses a point. You could also have a rule that if anyone spills or drops their drink they have to chug another one. Can you swap hands? Sure! If you throw right-handed but catch left-handed (or vice versa), you can switch off your drink—just make sure you don't spill any of it in the process."
    },
    {
      "title": "Defend with empty bottles.",
      "content": "Defend with empty bottles. If you happen to finish your drink in the midst of a round of Polish horseshoes, this rule allows you to use that empty bottle or can as a sort of weapon to smack the frisbee away before it hits either the pole or the bottle. You have to have just finished the drink and this option is only available for one round, after which you need a fresh drink! The ability to hit the frisbee before it hits either the pole or the bottle is pretty significant because otherwise, that would be interference and the throwing team would automatically win 3 points."
    },
    {
      "title": "Score on defense.",
      "content": "Score on defense. This is one variation that has nothing to do with drinking. If the frisbee hits the pole (or the bottle) and the defending team catches both the bottle and the frisbee before they hit the ground, the defending team is awarded 3 points. [16] X Research source This variation is likely to result in a closer score and a more competitive game that will probably end more quickly as well—especially if you're playing with seasoned expert players. Some variations also allow defense to score a single point if they catch either the frisbee or the bottle but not both."
