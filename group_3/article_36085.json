      "content": "Run a fine-toothed comb gently through your hair. Try to comb out the sections of paint that have now softened. You may want to clean the comb periodically with your fingers and set aside the bits of paint so that they don’t clog the drain."

      "content": "Rinse the hair thoroughly. Once you’ve removed as much paint as possible, rinse your hair again in warm water. Comb your fingers through your hair to help remove any lingering bits of paint that have flaked off."

      "content": "Use conditioner on your hair. Saturate the hair with conditioner to help restore some of its moisture. Let it sit in your hair for at least three minutes before rinsing so that your hair has a chance to soak up the conditioner’s oils. [2] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Rub olive oil or baby oil between your palms.",
      "content": "Rub olive oil or baby oil between your palms. Use a generous amount so that you can saturate your hair. If you have long hair, or if there’s a lot of paint in your hair, you may need to refill your palms with the oil several times. If you don’t have either of these oils, you could use other substances from around the house, like peanut butter or WD-40. [3] X Research source Follow the same process of rubbing the product between your palms, but if using WD-40, wear latex or disposable gloves since the product could cause skin irritation, and avoid using it near your scalp."

      "title": "Run your hands through the part of your hair with the paint.",
      "content": "Run your hands through the part of your hair with the paint. Check that the affected part of your hair is coated with oil, and allow it to sit in your hair for several minutes. This will soften the paint and make it easier to flake off. [4] X Research source For really stubborn dried paint, you may want to apply the oil to your hair, wrap your head in plastic wrap, and then wait a few hours to give it extra softening time.

      "title": "Use a fine-toothed comb to remove the softened paint.",
      "content": "Use a fine-toothed comb to remove the softened paint. Make sure to use gentle strokes, so as not to pull your hair from your scalp or to break it off at the ends. Try dividing your hair into 1-inch sections and combing them each separately. For bad tangles, start at the bottom of your hair and just comb out the last inch. Then move up and comb the inch above that. Progress this way until you’ve reached your scalp and can easily glide a comb from root to tip."

    {
      "title": "Shampoo as usual.",
      "content": "Shampoo as usual. Lather your hair with your typical shampoo and then rinse to remove the oil. Depending on how much oil was in your hair, you may need to shampoo and rinse a second time. You may condition if you wish, but you don’t need to since the oil you used to remove the paint also moisturized your hair. [6] X Research source"
