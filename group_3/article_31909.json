Maybe the conflict was caused by built-up resentment or jealousy. Though a little more difficult to combat, talking this out can bring you and your friend back to neutral ground. The conflict could also be caused by differing expectations. Maybe one of you wants to spend time together, but the other is fine just knowing the other is there when they need them. The difference in how you think about your friendship can lead to misunderstandings. If you are not on speaking terms, wait until things have calmed before reaching out. Time can give you a new perspective that makes the solution to your problem much clearer.
