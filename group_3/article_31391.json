      "title": "Eat a balanced diet.",
      "content": "Eat a balanced diet. You may feel hungry if you are not receiving the nutritional benefits of a balanced diet. Be sure that you eat items from each of the food groups. You should get plenty of vegetables and fruit, lean proteins, and whole grains, as well as a moderate amount of healthy oils and fats. [1] X Research source A balanced breakfast could be a half a cup of whole-grain oatmeal with a drizzle of honey, a cup of fresh strawberries, and a half a cup of cottage cheese. A healthy lunch could be a salad of dark mixed greens with dried cranberries, sunflower seeds, and crumbled cheese such as feta or goat cheese. You can make your own dressing or opt for a reduced-calorie dressing. Don’t like salads? Make a wrap! Wrap up those greens, cranberries, and sunflower seeds into a pita or a whole grain tortilla. You could also add a lean meat such as turkey to the wrap, and drizzle a little dressing on it. A balanced dinner could be a 4-oz serving of meat or fish, two vegetables, and a whole grain. For example, you could have grilled salmon, wild rice, roasted or steamed broccoli, and roasted butternut squash."

      "content": "Eat salad before meals. Lettuce has a high water content, so eating a salad with light dressing prior to your meal can help you fill up faster and feel less hungry after your meal.

      "content": "Eat healthy snacks. Snacking on high-energy snacks such as fruit and nuts can help you feel less hungry between meals.

      "title": "Sip water between bites of food.",
      "content": "Sip water between bites of food. Sometimes increasing the amount of water you drink can help you eat less.

Drinking green tea in place of water can give you a break from plain water. Green tea also acts as an antioxidant, which can contribute to weight loss."

      "content": "Avoid junk food. Junk food, processed food that is high in fat, salt, and sugar, makes you feel hungrier when you eat it. It is also designed to stimulate your taste buds and leads, essentially, to addiction and overeating. [5] X Research source Foods high in fat cause a chemical reaction in your brain that signals you to eat more, even though you're likely not really hungry. [6] X Research source Over-processing foods strips the foods of their nutrients. Your body needs nutrient-rich foods to run efficiently,so it will send a hunger signal even if you just ate a meal or snack with 1000 calories in it. [7] X Research source Eating salty foods can lead you to crave sweet foods, so you end up eating twice as many snacks as you need."

      "title": "Distinguish between emotional and physical hunger.",
      "content": "Distinguish between emotional and physical hunger. This may be surprising, but emotional hunger can easily mask itself as physical hunger. Knowing the differences between the two can help you make appropriate food choices. Here are some ways in which the two kinds of hunger differ: Physical hunger slowly builds, while emotional hunger is sudden and immediate. Physical hunger is not specific to a type of food, while emotional hunger may manifest as an intense craving for a specific food or food type. Emotional hunger can be triggered by boredom, while physical hunger isn’t. Try occupying yourself with another activity. If the hunger goes away, it was emotional. If it persists, it could be physical."

      "content": "Calm specific food cravings. Sometimes, a craving for a specific food can seem overwhelming. It’s okay to respond to such a craving; just acknowledge that the craving is likely emotional and not tied to true hunger. Indulge in a little bit of what you’re craving. Have a killer craving for French fries? Get a small order and savor them slowly. Want chocolate? Get a couple of small squares of dark chocolate and nibble on them between sips of coffee or tea. Substitute similar foods. Craving salty potato chips? Try substituting salted nuts, which may satisfy your salt craving while offering protein and healthy fat, which will keep you full longer. [8] X Research source This can cut down on your desire to snack later. Craving fried chicken? Try breading and oven baking chicken, which can offer a similar texture to fried chicken. Want something sweet? Eat fresh, seasonal fruit."
