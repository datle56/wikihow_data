      "content": "Get some mini, plastic drawer units. They are actually meant for storing office supplies, but they work great for earrings! You will typically find them in the storage section or office supply section. If you'd like, you can line the bottom of each drawer with a piece of foam. This way, you can poke your earrings into the foam to keep them in place. Choose a small one that is about 6 to 8 inches (15.24 to 20.32 centimeters) tall. Don't like the color? Pull the drawers out, and spray paint it! You can also decorate the box with glitter glue pens and/or pretty rhinestones. Store each type of earring in a different drawer. For example, you could keep all of your stud or post earrings in one drawer, and all of your hook earrings in another."

It won't work well for large, statement, or giant hoop earrings, but it's perfect for smaller earrings, including studs. You can keep the tray out on top of your dresser/counter, or you can store it in a drawer."

      "content": "Use plastic buttons to keep pairs of earrings together. This will work best for stud earrings, but it might also work for hook earrings. Also, buttons with two holes will work better than those with four. Once you have your earrings in the buttons, you can keep them in a box, dish, or drawer. Avoid coat buttons or buttons that have a single loop in the back."

      "title": "Poke stud earrings into a long strip of ribbon to keep them together.",
      "content": "Poke stud earrings into a long strip of ribbon to keep them together. Use a thick, sturdy ribbon, such as grosgrain. It will last longer and will be less likely to tear or run. Something that is between 1 and 2 inches (2.54 and 5.08 centimeters) will work the best. Store the ribbon in a box or drawer, or hang it on your wall with a thumb tack or pushpin."

Poke your stud earrings through it, then put it into your jewelry box or drawer. Weave ribbon around the edges of your plastic canvas to make it fancier. You can use a simple straight stitch or a blanket stitch."

      "content": "Get some mesh. This can be a sheet of plastic canvas, window screening, tulle, or even lace. Plastic canvas is a great choice, because it comes in all sorts of colors and is easy to work with; you can find it at an arts and crafts store. This holder will work best for hook earrings, but it can work for stud earrings as well. If you are using window screening, consider spray painting it a fun color first. Paint one side first, let it dry, then flip it over and paint the other side. For a rustic frame, try burlap instead. You can even add a silhouette or letter to it with some fabric paint and a stencil. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Take apart a picture frame. Discard the glass panel and the backing, or save them for another project. Alternatively, you can also use a simple, wooden frame base from the craft store; it doesn't come with a glass panel or backing, so it'll be less work for you. Don't worry about the color of the frame; you can always paint it."

      "content": "Trim the mesh so that it is slightly larger than the opening in the frame. Turn your frame over so that the back is facing you, then lay the mesh down on it. Use painter's tape or masking tape to mark off where you need to cut the mesh. When you are done, cut the mesh using the tape as your guideline. Peel off any excess tape. Don't use marker. Not only will you mess the frame up, but the marker will be hard to see on the material."

      "content": "Glue the mesh down to the back of the frame, and let it dry. Draw a line of glue around the outer edges of the opening on the back of the frame. Quickly press the mesh into the glue. You can use hot glue or tacky glue for this. If you used tulle, lace, or burlap, you can use fabric glue instead. Different types of glue will take different amounts of time to dry. Tacky glue will take a few hours while hot glue will set almost immediately. If you'd like to hide the glue, outline the inside edges of the mesh square with glue, then cover it with strips of ribbon. Make sure that the ribbon does not stick past the opening of the frame."

      "title": "Lean the frame against your wall or dresser.",
      "content": "Lean the frame against your wall or dresser. Because you took the backing out, the frame won't be able to stand up on its own. You can't put the backing in again either, because it will \"block\" the mesh and prevent you from inserting your earrings. If you want to make your frame a little more stable, there are a few things you can do: Cut a piece of ribbon and tie it into a loop. Glue it to the back of your frame, and use it to hang it up on the wall. Use a frame holder or frame stand to hold up your frame. Hot glue a short dowel or two to the back of the frame to make a stand. [4] X Research source If you'd like, you can paint the dowel to match the frame."

It is best for stud earrings, but it can work for hook earrings too. You can use acrylic paint or spray paint for this. For something more girlish, paint the outside of the box with fine, scrapbooking glitter. Be sure to coat it with a glossy sealer afterwards to keep the glitter from shedding, however.
