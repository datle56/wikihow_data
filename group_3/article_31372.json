      "title": "Your journey is all about showing courage and embracing individuality.",
      "content": "Your journey is all about showing courage and embracing individuality. Aries rules over the 1st house of identity, so having a north node in Aries means you’re being guided to express your most authentic self throughout your lifetime. To fulfill your north node’s purpose, you must release your fear of what other people think and fight for what you believe in, even if it means losing friends along the way. [1] X Research source An Aries north node means you’re fearless and unafraid to make things happen. However, sometimes you can be a little too impulsive. Famous people with their north nodes in Aries include Jennifer Aniston, Carl Jung, and Drake. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "If you have a north node in Aries, you have a south node in Libra.",
      "content": "If you have a north node in Aries, you have a south node in Libra. Every north node has a polar opposite south node, and Libra rests on the other side of Aries’ axis. Your south node represents your fears and the skills you use often to quell those fears. Having a south node in Libra, your biggest fear is being outcast. You gain a lot of validation from blending in with a group or institution, and you often do. You’re diplomatic, kind, and personable. However, this anxiety can hold you back from expressing your truest self. [3] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "You’re a free spirit, whose singularity is stifled by fear of fitting in.",
      "content": "You’re a free spirit, whose singularity is stifled by fear of fitting in. Nobody knows how to forge their own path better than an Aries. But to unlock your bright, creative potential as an Aries north node, you need to get comfortable on your own, without the support of a team. Stop focusing on what others think and start focusing on things that bring you joy and inspiration. People love Aries for their uniqueness. [4] X Research source While your Libra south node may be encouraging you to find comfort in a group, remember your soul’s purpose comes from finding individualism. Aries is naturally charming. Use that natural charm to show others how much fun being unique can be."

    {
      "title": "You alternate between assertive passion and delicate diplomacy.",
      "content": "You alternate between assertive passion and delicate diplomacy. The youngest of the zodiacal chart, Aries has boundless energy. However, ruled by Mars, you can be a tad too aggressive without even realizing it. On the other hand, your Libra south node is incredible at managing people, but may be too reserved and wishy-washy. When it comes to working with others, if you can find the compatibility between the tact of your Libra south node and the confidence of your Aries north node, the sky’s the limit for what you can accomplish. Aries’ biggest hardship comes from communication. Utilize your Libra south node’s excellent communication skills (like maintaining a level head, active listening, and using “I feel” statements) to help explain your goals. Libra tends to compromise a little too often. Use that Aries courage and stand your ground if you feel strongly about something."

    {
      "title": "You need independence so much, you sometimes push people away.",
      "content": "You need independence so much, you sometimes push people away. As an Aries north node, you likely deal with a somewhat restless desire to do your own thing and be your own person. While this is super admirable, remember that, despite what your Mars domicile may be telling you, people aren’t against you. You don’t need to push others away to take space for yourself. We often push people away because we don’t communicate our needs. Explain to others that you need time and energy for just you and you’ll see how easy it is to stop antagonizing."

      "title": "Remember that no relationship is better than a bad relationship.",
      "content": "Remember that no relationship is better than a bad relationship. Because you have a Libra south node, your self-esteem is likely rooted in the validation you receive from other people—even the wrong ones. If you feel trapped or restricted by your partner, accept that it’s time to break up. While this is certainly easier said than done, you deserve to feel free and you’ll thrive once you’re allowed to shine as your own person. The “wrong person” doesn’t always mean toxic. Sometimes, you may find people who are perfectly healthy, but a little too codependent or sensitive for your fiery personality. Ruled by Venus, Libra is extremely comfortable in relationships. Make sure to check in with yourself regularly and ask if you’re truly happy with your partner or if it’s just more convenient to stay with them. [5] X Research source Great ways to check-in with yourself include journaling, meditation, or even a weekly therapy appointment to voice your concerns."

      "title": "Be physically affectionate.",
      "content": "Be physically affectionate. Symbolized by the ram, Aries is a masculine sign that loves action and expressing themselves through physical contact. However, your Venus-ruled, feminine Libra south node likely feels embarrassed by the crass and carnal pleasures of heavy petting, wrestling, and PDA. If you feel a desire to show your partner love in a physical way, try to act on it immediately before your Libran intellect overthinks it. [6] X Research source If you feel shame with grander gestures of physical intimacy, start with smaller, gentler acts like hand-holding or cuddling. These will appease your Libra south node and make the process seem less intimidating."

    {
      "title": "Keep in mind that relationships are about collaboration, not winning.",
      "content": "Keep in mind that relationships are about collaboration, not winning. A cardinal fire sign, Aries loves a challenge. In fact, you probably often express your love through arguing and competition. But remember: you and your partner are a team. Teams are about compromise and affirmation. They’re not a battle for dominance. To express your creativity and aggression healthily, try activities where you and your partner can work together to win: team sports, story modes in video games, etc. Before you debate, try to find one thing you support about your partner’s statement and voice it. This will make sparring and arguing seem more fun and less combative."

      "title": "Embrace your entrepreneurial spirit.",
      "content": "Embrace your entrepreneurial spirit. The ruler of the first house, the first of the zodiac, Aries has incredible success starting new missions. Your independence and leadership is best suited in an environment where you can be your own boss. Consider starting your own enterprise (an Etsy shop, a bakery, whatever suits your interests) or find a project at your company where you can build it from the ground-up and have creative control. Aries does well in individualized, creative jobs where they can put themselves out there: acting, singing, public speaking, social media, etc."

      "title": "Find opportunities to fight for what you want.",
      "content": "Find opportunities to fight for what you want. Aries is ruled by Mars, so they love taking risks and going to battle. Channel this aggression and protective nature into an energy that benefits society. If you’re in sales, go to pitch meetings so you can fight for your product. If you’re in social work, fight for your clients by creating safe spaces. Consider every workday a challenge where you’re fighting to make the world a better place. [7] X Research source Aries’ love for thrill and challenge can also be channeled well into first responder careers like firefighting and nursing."

      "title": "Seek out opportunities to advance your career.",
      "content": "Seek out opportunities to advance your career. Patience can often be rewarded at work. But not if you’re an Aries. Waiting for your chance to shine not only plays against your skillset, it’ll make you miserable the entire time. Instead, actively seek out ways in which you can grow your enterprise and improve your position. Ask your boss regularly about new projects. Look online for new job openings. Aries is a seeker. Seek ways to grow your success wherever you can find them."

      "content": "Each of the 12 houses represents a unique area of your life. When you were born, the placement of every planet fell within the boundaries of a specific astrological house. Each of the 12 houses rules a different part of your personality and lifetime journey. And house placement of your north node varies from person to person. Therefore, the house placement of your Aries north node offers unique wisdom into the specific energies you should focus on to achieve your destiny. [8] X Research source North nodes and south nodes exist on the same axis, so wherever your north node is in the 12 houses, your south node will always be 6 houses away."

Make sure you have your exact birth time handy; your ascendant (or rising) sign (which, appropriately, governs your first impressions) sets the tone for calculating where your houses fall."

      "content": "North node in 1st house: forge your own identity. Because Aries rules the 1st house of identity, this placement is the most powerful for an Aries north node. Your overall journey is about learning to forge your own identity and not letting other people control your personality. To help build an identity, try experimenting with new hobbies, new clothing styles, or setting new goals that are totally unique to you.

      "content": "North node in 2nd house: create financial stability for yourself. Because Aries has a more childlike personality (it’s the youngest zodiac sign), you may have relied on others for material wealth (which is ruled by the 2nd house). Having an Aries north node here is all about becoming financially independent. Create a new budget that helps you save for the future and start or increase your payment plan if you have any debts.

      "title": "North node in 3rd house: voice your own ideas more.",
      "content": "North node in 3rd house: voice your own ideas more. The 3rd house rules communication and intellect. Having an intellectual but team-oriented Libra south node, it’s likely you had a lot of brilliant revelations in a past life, but were too scared of alienation to voice them. Having an Aries north node in the 3rd house is all about making your new, creative ideas heard loud and clear—even when (heck, especially when) others disapprove of them. [11] X Research source Accepting disapproval can be tough, but the sooner you learn to tolerate it, the easier it will be to live a life free of fear: fear of other’s opinions, fear of failure, fear in general."

      "content": "North node in 4th house: create a private life outside your family. Aries does well in the 4th house of the family, because it’s a loyal and protective family member. But having a north node here should remind you of your need for space. Your parents, siblings, and friends don’t need to be involved in every part of your life. Start building social circles that don’t include family and set aside at least an hour a day where you do things just for yourself."

    {
      "title": "North node in 5th house: treat yourself and only yourself.",
      "content": "North node in 5th house: treat yourself and only yourself. The 5th house rules pleasure, so it’s important to reject your Libra south node tendency to appease a group and do/buy something just for you. In fact, please both your signs by taking yourself to a spa or beautification appointment (eyebrows, mani pedi, etc.). The physicality will make your Aries side happy and the aesthetic value will make your Libra side happy."

    {
      "title": "North node in 6th house: set your own schedule.",
      "content": "North node in 6th house: set your own schedule. The 6th house oversees health, habits and routines. As an Aries north node, you’re happiest working on your own time, but your Libra south node likely makes you feel like you’ll be left behind if you stray from the schedule of others. Scheduling for yourself is all about priority; start prioritizing activities that you need to get done before doing things for other people. If the people in your life are worth it, they’ll respect your needs and you’ll be more organized and fulfilled."

      "title": "North node in 7th house: be a more assertive partner.",
      "content": "North node in 7th house: be a more assertive partner. The 7th house of partnerships is the toughest placement for an Aries north node, because it’s where Libra is strongest. Your Libra south node is on full blast here telling you to keep the peace and cave in to the needs of your partner. It’s important to utilize this thoughtfulness, but to stand your ground and take charge in your relationship. [12] X Research source Taking charge in a relationship is all about improving your self-esteem and knowing your worth. Set aside some time every day to reflect on things you’re proud of. It’s impossible to have a power balance in toxic relationships. Be on the lookout for signs of toxicity in your partner like: hypercriticism, gaslighting, and contempt."

      "title": "North node in 8th house: let your protective side shine.",
      "content": "North node in 8th house: let your protective side shine. The 8th house of aggression, intimacy, and transformation is a heavy one. It focuses on sharing with another partner and bonding into a unit. While your Aries north node’s desire for space may be initially hesitant to settle here, use your natural Mars instinct to protect your partner. Affirm them when they beat themselves up. Confront people who criticize them. This protection will show your commitment and help strengthen the intimacy in your relationship. [13] X Research source"

      "title": "North node in 9th house: create your own philosophy.",
      "content": "North node in 9th house: create your own philosophy. The 9th house of philosophy may be hard if you have an Aries north node. A young sign focused on action, the big ideas (religion, government) likely bored or intimidated you, so you followed a more set system. But Aries is a leader and creator. If you have a 9th house Aries north node, become comfortable rejecting the traditions of established beliefs and follow one that fits you. To aid this process, try creating a pro-con list for an established philosophy. Write what you agree with on one side and what you disagree with on the other."

      "title": "North node in 10th house: focus on your discipline.",
      "content": "North node in 10th house: focus on your discipline. The 10th house of career and status requires a lot of responsibility. Aries are a lot of wonderful things, but dependable isn’t one of them. Your passion and spontaneity causes you to lose interest easily. If you have a north node placement here, focus on being dependable. The more people can rely on you, the more likely they are to follow you and embrace your ideas, which will help you thrive. [14] X Research source Start small with building healthy habits. Focus on working a set number of hours a day (this doesn’t have to be excessive) and getting an adequate amount of sleep. Then, expand from there."

      "content": "North node in 11th house: take your creative ideas to a group. If you have an Aries north node in the 11th house of friendships and community, take your brilliant plans to a team to put them in action. The more people that are onboard with your mission, the easier it’ll be in accomplishing your goal. Just remember that you’re the leader. Don’t let your Libra south node’s fear of losing friends take over and force you to sacrifice your genius."

      "title": "North node in 12th house: embrace the unknown.",
      "content": "North node in 12th house: embrace the unknown. The 12th house of subconscious and completion is the most mysterious, which can be very rewarding for an Aries. Your love of risks and thrill will do well here. Don’t be afraid to try new things, especially if you have no clue how they’ll turn out. That’s often the most rewarding part!"
