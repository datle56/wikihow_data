From there, let your nose guide you to where the smell is strongest. [1] X Research source You may have to do some investigating if the animal didn't perish out in plain sight.

      "content": "Get rid of the source of the odor. What you do with the body will depend on the local bylaws in your municipality, but your options include burying, burning, and throwing the body in the trash. Don't touch the animal directly: either wear gloves or use a shovel to move the carcass around. If you can bury the animal, place it in a compostable bag and then into a small box. Consult area maps or your local zoning office to be sure you aren't going to hit any pipes or water lines. Dig a hole three to four feet deep, place the box at the bottom, and fill the hole back in. [3] X Trustworthy Source Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Main public health institute for the US, run by the Dept. of Health and Human Services Go to source Your municipality might allow burning, in which case you can burn the body on a bonfire. To dispose of the body in the garbage, wrap the body in newspaper, then double bag it in sealable plastic bags before throwing it in the trash. You may also be able to call an animal control service to pick up the body, or you may be able to drop the carcass off for them to dispose of."

      "content": "Know what to do if you can't locate the animal. If the animal died in an inaccessible place—such as inside a wall—you may not be able to remove the body to get rid of the odor. The time it takes for decomposition and the smell to dissipate will depend on the size of the animal, the temperature, and the humidity, but it could take several weeks or even months. Locate the general vicinity of the source of the smell. If necessary and possible, drill a few holes to open up the area where the animal is (such as under floorboards or behind a wall) so that you can treat the area with a disinfectant or odor eliminator. Use a strong odor eliminator or disinfectant in the area. You can do this by spraying a product like Bac-Azap into the holes or hanging Earth Care Odor Remover Bags or Smelleze around. [7] X Research source Replace the bags as necessary or continue spraying the eliminating spray until the decomposition has finished. Plug up the holes once the smell is gone."

Open as many windows as possible in the area to get the air moving. Set up a few fans to blow air from inside the house out the windows. This is especially important if you can't remove the animal.

Animals can get in to your house through holes, cracks, vents, and other openings, and the best way to prevent them from getting inside and dying in your home is to cover these entry points. Be sure to cover holes larger than one half-inch (1.25 cm) in diameter, vents, chimneys, crawl spaces, gaps, and cracks. Use materials such as concrete, metal wire, and mortar, otherwise animals will chew through the materials to gain entry into your home."

Piles of wood, trash, overgrown bushes, and overhanging branches can all be used by animals as either shelter or ways to access otherwise inaccessible parts of your home. Be sure to clean up debris from around your home and keep plants, trees, and grasses cut back and maintained. For instance, a thicket of overgrown bushes might make a great place for a rodent to make a nest. Branches hanging over your house might allow animals to access your home from the roof. Similarly, debris, garbage, and organic matter piled up against your home could give animals access to higher entry points they wouldn't be able to reach."
