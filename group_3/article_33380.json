Playing a card means putting it on 1 of the 4 building piles in the center of the playing area (there shouldn’t be any building piles at this point). Building piles are created by playing the numbers 1 through 10 in order. To play on a building pile, you need the next card up in the sequence. The first player needs to have a “1” card or wild card to get a pile started. There are two places the first player might have a “1” card or wild card: [6] X Research source Their stockpile: If the face-up card on top of the first player’s stockpile is a “1” card or wild card, they can play it. After they play it, they should flip the next card in their stockpile face up. Their hand: If one of the 3 cards the dealer gave them is a “1” card or wild card, they can play that card."

[7] X Research source For example, if the first player had a “1” card in their hand and played it, they could then play a “2” card on top of the “1” card if they have one. If they also had a “3” card, they could then play that on top of the “2” card, and so on. If the first player had two “1” cards, they could start two separate building piles in the middle of the playing area. There can only be 4 building piles at a time."
