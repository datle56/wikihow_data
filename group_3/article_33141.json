      "content": "Start a new game. When the game starts up, you will be met with a creepy-looking title screen, with animatronics flickering from both their Toy and Withered forms. Click New Game. You start on Night 1. Only the Toy animatronics move in this night."

      "title": "Press Ctrl to use your flashlight.",
      "content": "Press Ctrl to use your flashlight. Be careful, because it can run out of battery. When you use it, you can see down the hallway in front of you and see if any animatronics are coming down it. Flash it a few times at any animatronics in the hallway, specifically, Withered Foxy. You can also use it on the cameras. This is especially useful for very dark rooms, like the Back Room."

      "title": "Look out for the vents to the left and right of you.",
      "content": "Look out for the vents to the left and right of you. You also want to check these often because animatronics can and will come from them. A button above them toggles a light."

      "title": "Put on your mask when you see an animatronic.",
      "content": "Put on your mask when you see an animatronic. This is especially important if they're in the vents or your office. The mask will not work on the Puppet or Withered Foxy. There will be two buttons at the bottom of the screen. The red one brings up your mask if you hover the mouse over it. The white one brings up your monitor. When/if you hear banging from the vents after an animatronic has already visited your room, then that means it's safe to take the mask off."

      "title": "Use your camera to keep an eye out for approaching animatronics.",
      "content": "Use your camera to keep an eye out for approaching animatronics. Using this, you'll be able to monitor other parts of the map, including your blind spots. You really shouldn't be on any other cameras except for Cam 11 unless you want to keep track of where all the animatronics are, but it's not necessary. Cam 11is the most important camera, as this is the room that harbors the Puppet. Also, watch out for the vents, too, which are Cam 5 and 6. Most of the animatronics, with a few exceptions, will sneak into your Office using the vent system."

      "title": "Look for the circle in Cam 11.",
      "content": "Look for the circle in Cam 11. On the camera in Cam 11, there is a thing you have to do to keep an animatronic away from you. There will be a button saying \"Wind Up Music Box\" and a circle next to that. According to Phone Guy, it is \"rigged to be wound up remotely\", meaning you can wind up the Music Box form your Monitor, Do not let that circle run out. This is extremely important. If it does, it will only be a matter of seconds before the Marionette/Puppet gets you, unless you make it to 6 am before it does. The Puppet is not fooled by the mask. You generally only want the circle to drop halfway before re-winding it."

      "title": "Be quick.",
      "content": "Be quick. Whenever an animatronic appears in front of you in your office area, put the mask on instantly. With Toy Freddy, you only have 1.2 seconds to put it on. If you don't, then you're toast. The mask will trick the animatronics into thinking that you're one, so it's an essential piece of gameplay. On Nights 3 and on, every time you flip down the camera, it is recommended to put up the mask immediately in case an animatronic is in your Office. The mask does not work on Withered Foxy or Marionette, another two animatronics. To keep away Withered Foxy, flash your light at him a few times. You want to flash him 2-3 times."

      "title": "Be prepared for an increasing challenge.",
      "content": "Be prepared for an increasing challenge. If you pass the first night, then congrats! It will progressively get harder the further into the game you get. Don't worry if you die multiple times- just keep trying. And whatever you do, don't rage quit. That's just humiliating for everyone involved."

      "title": "Tackle Night 2.",
      "content": "Tackle Night 2. Night 2 is almost the same as Night 1, but more threats appear on this night. Foxy will appear in your hallway, and the animatronics will come out earlier, including the old ones. Mangle also appears, but she is not much of a threat unless she ends up in your Office. Keep in mind that you must check Cam 11 after each time you check your office."

    {
      "title": "Beat Night 3.",
      "content": "Beat Night 3. Now it gets harder, as forgetting to wear the mask after checking the vents will trigger a jumpscare next time you put down your cameras. The only camera you need is Cam 11 for the Music Box. If you hear Mangles garbled static while the camera is up, that means she has infiltrated your office. Don't become too panicked, though. She hangs from the ceiling for a bit, so if she does end up entering your office, beforehand, try to have kept her away until at least the second half of 5 am. Withered Foxy will also become more active during the night, so don't forget to flash him a couple of times to keep him at bay."

      "title": "Tackle Night 4.",
      "content": "Tackle Night 4. This is very similar to Night 3, except all the animatronics are a lot more active. Keep a close eye on Withered Foxy and the Marionette."

    {
      "title": "Beat the final night.",
      "content": "Beat the final night. This night is the hardest of the first five. To complete this night, you must check Cam 11 all the time. Do \"not\" use the Flashlight at any time unless you are flashing Foxy. If an animatronic is in your office for a long time, go straight to the Prize Corner, and wind the box to at least half way. Toy Bonnie and Withered Foxy will be problems in this situation, as Withered Foxy will stay in the hall for ages, even the entire night, and even the slightest mistake will trigger a jumpscare. Toy Bonnie will stay in the vent for a long time too, and if you don't put on the mask and keep him away long enough, it will result in a jumpscare. There is a chance however that another animatronic may get in your office before Toy Bonnie gets a chance to jumpscare you. If this happens, pull up your mask as soon as possible."
