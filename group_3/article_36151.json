      "title": "Blot the urine on your carpet with paper towels.",
      "content": "Blot the urine on your carpet with paper towels. Try to remove as much of the urine as possible. This will ultimately make your job easier. Use clean paper towels and apply pressure. Repeat with new paper towels until you are unable to soak up any more urine. [1] X Research source Skip this step if the urine has already dried. You can also use old throw-away towels instead of paper ones. The thickness of regular towels allows for better absorption, soaking up more cat urine. If available, use a white towel. Once there's no longer a yellow-tint to the liquid being absorbed, you'll know all the urine has been absorbed."

      "title": "Use an enzymatic cleaner.",
      "content": "Use an enzymatic cleaner. Enzymatic cleaners, like Nature's Miracle, contain special biological enzymes that break down the proteins in urine, reducing or even completely eliminating the smell. Note that some enzymatic cleaners may not work if other chemicals were used beforehand to try to treat the stain. It is generally a good idea to try the enzymatic cleaner first and saturate the area well. Follow the manufacturer’s directions closely and allow it to dry for several days. You may not have to do anything else. Enzymatic cleaner may not work in old urine stains. Avoid heavily saturating the carpet. Be aware of the downward migration of liquid, and understand the type of subfloor you are dealing with. Allow the enzymes to work, following the label instructions for dwell time. Sometimes, it helps to cover the affected area with plastic and allow the enzymes to work for a longer period of time. Always follow the label instructions."

      "title": "Mix up a vinegar solution.",
      "content": "Mix up a vinegar solution. If an enzyme cleaner didn't completely remove the smell, use a vinegar solution. Combine equal parts of white vinegar and water in a bowl or spray bottle. Saturate or spray the soiled area. Saturate a little bit beyond the soiled area so you can be sure to remove all urine. If you have a black light or UV light at your disposal, you can see the urine glow in the dark and find the exact location of the urine spot. Always use caution when saturating the carpet—it's important to consider the type of subfloor you have. For example, an OSB subfloor can suffer damage from oversaturation as it's not waterproof or water-resistant.

      "content": "Dry the area thoroughly. Again, use paper towels or a clean rag to blot up as much vinegar solution as possible. Let the area air dry completely after you've blotted it. To help dry an area faster, use a fan. Position the fan so that the airflow moves over the carpet, not directly at the wet spot."

      "content": "Vacuum the soiled area. Vacuuming the soiled area removes both the urine particles and the deodorizer you applied. Extracting wet vacs works the best for this since they saturate the carpet and then vacuum the water back into the vacuum's tank. [3] X Research source In a pinch, you can use your regular vacuum; it just won't be as effective as the wet vac. For best results with a wet vac, use cool water in the vacuum tank and always follow the manufacturer's instructions. Avoid using steam cleaners, since the high heat will actually set the stain."

      "content": "Re-train your cat. Never yell or punish your cat for urinating in the wrong area. Instead, quickly move her to the litter box. Consistently take her to the litter box and give positive feedback when she uses it. This will reinforce a positive association with urinating and her litter box."

      "content": "Replace the cat's litter box more often. Cats like clean litter boxes, just as humans like clean bathrooms. If you're neglecting your cat's needs when it comes to offering a clean litter box, he may find it harder to resist urinating on your sofa or carpet. Keep your cat's litter box in a quiet location that is not near its feeding area. This will increase the chance that the box will be used properly."

      "content": "Have your cat checked by the veterinarian. While accidents do happen, particularly with young or even elderly animals, there may be a medical issue at the heart of the problem if you notice your pet urinating inappropriately. Contact your veterinarian to discuss possible medical reasons that your cat is urinating outside of the litter box. Ignoring a medical issue, such as a urinary tract infection, kidney disease or diabetes, could be life-threatening for your pet."
