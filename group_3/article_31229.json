      "title": "“My person” is a deep and heartfelt term of endearment.",
      "content": "“My person” is a deep and heartfelt term of endearment. The phrase “You are my person” describes a strong, unbreakable connection between two people. In love and relationships, “my person” is like a soulmate —someone who understands you better than anyone and is always there for you. Your “person” holds a special, singular place in your heart. [1] X Research source When you’re someone’s “person,” it means they know you even better than you know yourself (and vice versa). Your “person” isn’t necessarily the same throughout your life. It can change over time, and you might find a new “person” sometimes."

      "title": "The phrase “You’re my favorite person” has a similar meaning.",
      "content": "The phrase “You’re my favorite person” has a similar meaning. When someone says you’re their favorite person, they’re basically saying that they love you more than anything! A “favorite person” is someone who means the world to you and is irreplaceable in your life; they’re closer to you than anyone, and there’s genuinely nobody else you like being around more.

      "title": "“My person” can apply to best friends, family, or romantic partners.",
      "content": "“My person” can apply to best friends, family, or romantic partners. Although a lot of people refer to their partners as their “person,” the term isn’t exclusively romantic. Anybody with whom you feel a uniquely deep connection and share emotional closeness can be “your person,” whether it’s a close friend, parent, cousin, or significant other. [3] X Research source The same is true of your “favorite person.” It doesn’t have to be romantic (though, for many people, it is). Your favorite person could be a true friend or family member. For example, you might consider your best friend your “person.” And, if you meet a partner later on, they might become your “person” next."

      "title": "The phrase became popular from a line in Grey’s Anatomy.",
      "content": "The phrase became popular from a line in Grey’s Anatomy . Two characters from the medical drama Grey’s Anatomy (Meredith Grey and Cristina Yang) used the term to describe their close friendship. When referring to Meredith as her emergency contact, Cristina says, “You’re my person.” Later in the show, Meredith tells Cristina, “You’re my sister. You’re my family. You’re all I’ve got.” [4] X Research source Cristina also says, “If I murdered someone, she [Meredith] is the person I’d call to help drag the corpse across the living room floor.” In short, they have an incredibly supportive relationship. They show up for each other when it matters most, which is why they’re one another’s “person.”"

      "content": "Since then, “My person” has appeared on other shows and social media. For instance, singles on reality dating shows like The Bachelor often say they’re looking for “my person.” Beyond that, there’s a #myperson hashtag on Instagram with tons of posts—because it’s a common way to refer to a partner or best friend. There’s even merchandise with “My person” or “You’re my person” written on it (designed to be given to special someone). The term is so widespread now that you might hear (or see) it just about anywhere, especially on social media."

    {
      "title": "They’re always honest with you.",
      "content": "They’re always honest with you. “Your person” is someone who won’t hold back around you. You can always trust them to tell the truth —and even when you need to be called out, they’ll be straightforward (but kind) about it. They’ll tell you what’s on their mind—and, in turn, you’ll be eager to share your honest thoughts with them, too."

      "title": "They’re the first person you talk to.",
      "content": "They’re the first person you talk to. Whether you need to talk about good news, bad news, or anything from family drama to the latest gossip between friends, “your person” is the one you go to first and speak the most freely to. They’re the person you can text or call anytime, even if one of you is in a bad mood—and they do the same with you."

      "content": "You can’t picture a future without them. Think about your future—is there one person who’s always in the picture, no matter what else might change in your life? It might be a best friend you know you’ll still talk to no matter where each of you live or a partner you want to grow old with; either way, “your person” is someone who’s there for the long haul.

      "title": "You can’t stay mad at them.",
      "content": "You can’t stay mad at them. Every duo goes argues sometimes. However, you’ll always find a way to make up and move on when it comes to “your person.” It might feel like you’re never upset with them for long—and things that might make you super angry if someone else did them might not bother you so much when it’s your person. [6] X Research source Basically, you may notice that your love for one another keeps your connection strong, even when you’re frustrated with one another."

      "title": "They can read your emotions (and you can read theirs).",
      "content": "They can read your emotions (and you can read theirs). Your person will notice when you’re feeling down or need a shoulder to cry on, even if nobody else can. You might seem totally fine to the rest of the world, but “your person” can pick up on the tiniest signals from you—and they’re always ready to talk when you need it. That doesn't mean they’ll push you to be vulnerable with them. Someone who’s “your person” also respects your feelings! So, even if you’re upset, they’ll give you space and let you open up to them in time—because they’ll know that’s what you need."

      "title": "They support you unconditionally.",
      "content": "They support you unconditionally. As mentioned above, “your person” is someone who’s automatically on your side. You’ll never have to doubt that they’re on your team because it’ll be obvious they’ve got your back. They’ll offer unconditional support and be your cheerleader when you need encouragement from someone who wholeheartedly believes in you. [7] X Research source Your person is the one you’d call when you need help, even in the middle of the night or from far away, because you know they’ll do what they can. That’s one of the reasons “your person” will also be honest and even call you out—because you each trust and support one another enough to know that it comes from a place of love."

      "content": "You feel totally comfortable around them. You could be sick or having a bad hair day, but you still want to see them. Whether you look your best or you’re completely unkempt, you won’t feel uncomfortable or like you have to appear a certain way around your “person.” You can just be yourself , and they’ll love you exactly as you are.

      "content": "You have a strong gut feeling that they’re your person. Sometimes, you just know things because you sense them so deeply—which is why you may simply have a feeling about somebody and recognize them as your person. [9] X Research source When you understand each other that well, there might not be a tangible reason for your connection; it’s just there, and you both know it. Consider if there’s someone in your life who immediately understood you, accepted you, and always makes you feel less alone. If so, they might be your person."
