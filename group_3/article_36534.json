      "content": "Move your hair out of the way to expose the tape. Start at the side of your head and make sure that you can easily see what you are doing in a mirror. Shift all of the hair that is covering the tape at the top of the hair extension to the other side of your head. Hold the hair that you moved out of the way in place with a clip if it won’t stay in place on its own. [1] X Research source It’s easiest to begin in a place on your head that you can see from a mirror so you'll be able to see what you're doing when you get started. That way, you'll be practiced and feel confident once you reach the back of your head. For this reason, start removing the tape at the front of your hair and work your way backwards."

      "content": "Saturate the tape with hair extension tape remover. Hair extension tape removers are oil-based products that work by dissolving the glue that holds the tape to your hair, which means that you can easily peel off the tape. Simply spray the product generously over the tape, until the area is saturated. [2] X Research source These products help to release your natural hair from the tape. This means that you can remove your hair extensions without your natural hair being damaged. Alternatively, some hair extension tape remover products are designed to be poured or dripped onto the tape rather than sprayed. Choose the type of product that suits you the best.

      "content": "Wiggle the hair extension to see if it moves. Gently pull on the part of the hair extension that is the closest to the tape. Wiggle it lightly, but be careful not to tug on it too much as you could damage your hair and the extension. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Apply more remover and let it sit for a minute if the hair extension is still stuck. Saturate the tape with the hair extension remover again. Let it sit for a few minutes so the remover can loosen the glue, which will make it easier to remove the extension. Then, wiggle the hair extension to check that it is loose and that the tape feels as though it is lifting away and releasing your hair. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Peel away the tape gently when it can be easily lifted off.",
      "content": "Peel away the tape gently when it can be easily lifted off. Use your fingernails to peel the tape away from your natural hair. It should easily come away in your hands. The tape will stay attached to the hair extensions but not to your natural hair. [6] X Research source Never try to force the tape away from your hair, as this can cause damage and breakage. If you are having trouble getting the tape to release your hair, either try a different hair extension remover product or visit a professional hair stylist for help. [7] X Research source If the extension remover isn't working after several applications, it's not the right product for you. Look for a better quality product for your hair."

      "title": "Work your way through all of your hair extensions.",
      "content": "Work your way through all of your hair extensions. Work through each row of hair extensions, starting from the left and ending on the right. Begin at the top of your head and work towards the bottom. Follow the same process of applying plenty of hair extension remover to each piece of tape and peeling it away when it feels as though it can easily fall out. [8] X Research source Work on only 1 piece of tape at a time, rather than trying to remove multiple hair extensions at once. This ensures that your natural hair doesn’t get damaged. Don’t worry if it looks like you are losing a lot of hair while you're removing the extensions. Without tape hair extensions, you lose 50-100 strands of hair per day. When the tape is removed, the extra hair isn't held in place and will fall out. Your hair will also feel thinner due to not having the bulk of the extensions. [9] X Research source"

      "content": "Wash and condition your hair to remove any residue from the tape. Once you have taken all of your hair extensions out, it’s likely that your hair will feel oily or sticky due to both the tape residue and the hair extension remover. Wash your hair as normal and apply a conditioner to ensure that your hair stays moisturized. Comb the conditioner through your hair to help remove the stickiness. [10] X Research source If your hair feels particularly dry, use a deep conditioner instead. This will help your hair to be shiny and healthy again. Hair extensions don’t impact hair growth, which means that your hair will grow normally. [11] X Research source"
