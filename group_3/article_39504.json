      "content": "Fill a bucket with very hot water if you can submerge the leather. If you're shrinking an item you can get completely wet, the easiest way to soak it is to place it in a large bath. Turn your tap to the hottest setting and let it run until the water is as hot as it will get, then fill a large pot, bucket, or even your bathtub. [1] X Research source Items you can soak would include all-leather items such as leather clothing, boots, gloves, and accessories."

      "title": "Pour the hot water into a spray bottle if you can't soak the leather.",
      "content": "Pour the hot water into a spray bottle if you can't soak the leather. If your leather item contains parts that shouldn't get wet, like the soles on a pair of dress shoes, fill a large spray bottle with the water instead. That way, you'll be able to spritz the water directly onto the leather. [2] X Expert Source Mallika Sharma Certified Leather Care Technician Expert Interview. 14 December 2020. Some buckles and snaps may rust if they get wet, so you may want to avoid getting those wet. You can also spray an item that's too big to soak, such as the leather on your sofa or car seats."

      "title": "Saturate the leather completely with hot water.",
      "content": "Saturate the leather completely with hot water. If you're soaking the leather in a bucket or a tub, place the item in the water, then push it down to ensure it's completely submerged. If you're using a spray bottle, lay the leather item flat, then completely soak the entire surface. If you need to, turn it over and soak the other side, as well. Make sure to get all of the leather evenly wet. Otherwise, there may be an obvious color difference between the parts you soaked and the parts that stayed dry. If you're spraying the leather, you may want to place the item on a plastic sheet to keep from soaking the surface underneath it."

      "content": "Soak thick leather up to an hour to ensure it's completely wet. If you're soaking something made of especially thick, hard leather, like a pair of boots or a heavy vest, you may need to let it soak for a while so the water can fully penetrate the leather. If you're not sure, leave the leather in the water for about an hour, then take it out. [3] X Research source If your item is made of thin leather, however, like soft leather gloves, plunging it into the water may be enough to soak it."

      "title": "Place the leather in the sun to dry if you live in a hot climate.",
      "content": "Place the leather in the sun to dry if you live in a hot climate. Once you've soaked the leather, it's important to dry it with heat to get the fibers to stretch. Lay the item flat in a sunny spot, like on a patio table or on a towel in your yard, and leave it in the sun until it's completely dry. [4] X Research source Don't hang the leather, as the weight of the water might cause the item to stretch, rather than shrink. Avoid placing the leather in front of a source of high heat, like a radiator. Drying the leather too quickly could cause it to become brittle or even crack. Check the care label if you're shrinking a leather garmentâ€”as long as the leather isn't suede or nubuck, you can put it in the dryer on high heat for 30 minutes to shrink it. However, keep in mind that the leather will take on a puckered, distressed look if you do this.

      "content": "Use your hairdryer set to low speed to dry the leather indoors. Set your hairdryer to the highest heat but the lowest speed and turn it on. Move the nozzle slowly back and forth, keeping the end of the hairdryer about 4 in (10 cm) from the surface of the leather. Continue doing this until the leather is dry. Avoid leaving the nozzle of the hairdryer in one place for too long, as it could burn the leather."

      "content": "Continue soaking and drying the leather up to 3 times if it's needed. Once the leather item is dry, check to see if it shrank as much as you needed. If you still need it to shrink a little more, start over with the soaking process. Do this two more times, if necessary. If the leather isn't the size you want after 3 rounds of wetting and drying it, you may just need to purchase a new item that's the size you want."

      "content": "Condition the leather to soften it . Water and heat can both dry out leather, leaving it very brittle. To avoid this, put a few drops of leather conditioner on a clean cloth, then rub it into the surface of the leather. Add more conditioner to the cloth as you need it, and keep massaging the conditioner into the item until it's completely coated. [6] X Research source You can find leather conditioner anywhere that leather is sold, as well as at many big-box stores that sell household cleaners and supplies."
