      "content": "Stand with your feet about hip-width apart just in front of the bar. Your shoelaces should be underneath the barbell. [1] X Research source Be sure you're standing at the center of the barbell—if it's off-balance when you're lifting, you could be injured. If you’re on the taller side, you may need to slide your feet a little farther apart so you can reach the bar. If that doesn't work, try the lifted variation."

      "title": "Bend forward by pushing your hips back while hinging your hips.",
      "content": "Bend forward by pushing your hips back while hinging your hips. Bend your knees slightly, then fold forward and push your hips backward until your torso is nearly parallel with the floor. Keep your back flat, with your lower spine gently curved inward in a neutral position. [2] X Research source Engage your core—this will help you protect your back as you lift. Keep your head and neck neutral, with your eyes on the floor ahead of you. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Grab the bar with an overhand grip.",
      "content": "Grab the bar with an overhand grip. Place your hands on the bar so they’re slightly wider than shoulder-width apart. As you do this, make sure your palms are facing you and your fingers are wrapped around the outside of the bar. [4] X Research source Your hands should be spaced a little wider than your feet. [5] X Research source As you grip the bar, keep your shoulder blades pulled in together. Avoid pinching your elbows in too close to your torso or flaring your elbows too far out to the side.

      "title": "Lift the barbell quickly up towards your center.",
      "content": "Lift the barbell quickly up towards your center. In a quick, powerful motion, push your elbows back and draw your shoulder blades together and down as you lift the weight. Lift the barbell straight up, so at its peak, it’s between your belly button and your chest. [7] X Research source Avoid moving using your legs or back to lift the barbell—the power should come from your back and shoulders. [8] X Research source To avoid injury, maintain control of your form through the whole move. Keep your back flat and your core tight, and don’t lift your head or chest."

    {
      "title": "Lower the bar back down so it touches the floor.",
      "content": "Lower the bar back down so it touches the floor. Most of the power from the Pendlay row comes during the concentric (upward) movement, so it’s okay to let momentum help as you lower the barbell. But do keep some control so the barbell doesn’t crash down dangerously to the floor. [9] X Research source The barbell should end up in its starting position after each lift."

      "title": "Repeat for 3 or 4 sets of 5–8 reps.",
      "content": "Repeat for 3 or 4 sets of 5–8 reps. Because you’re lifting a heavier weight, you don’t need to max out the reps on the Pendlay row, and you’ll likely see results from sets of 5–8 reps each. [10] X Research source Pause for about 1–2 minutes between sets so you can catch your breath and reset. [11] X Research source If you want to improve your endurance, lift lighter weights, and increase your reps to 12–15 per set. [12] X Research source"

      "content": "Elevated Pendlay row: Lift the barbell by placing it on weight plates, mats, or lifting blocks. [13] X Research source Be sure whatever you use will keep the weights from rolling during the exercise. Try this variation if : you’re taller or you don’t have good flexibility in your hips, as raising the barbell can make it easier to keep your spine neutral as you bend down to pick up the weight."

      "content": "Banded Pendlay row: Drape a thin resistance band over the barbell so half of the band is on the outside of the bar and half is inside, closer to you. Stand in the center of the band where it touches the floor. Grip the bar so your hands are inside of the bar, then lift using the traditional Pendlay row technique. [14] X Research source Try this variation if : you want to make the Pendlay row more difficult at the top of the lift."

      "content": "Kettlebell Pendlay row: Instead of using barbells, place kettlebells on the outside of each foot. Use the same form as a barbell Pendlay row—keep your back flat and your core tight. Lift straight back, leading with your elbows. Bring the kettlebells up to your sides, then lower them back to the ground. [15] X Research source Try this variation if : you want to work your stabilizer muscles, as kettlebells offer less stability than barbells. [16] X Research source"

      "title": "Paused Pendlay row:",
      "content": "Paused Pendlay row: Add a slight pause at the top of your Pendlay row, when the barbell is near your chest. This will make the exercise harder since you’ll have less momentum to help you lift and lower the bar.

      "content": "Bent-over barbell row: After you grab the barbell, straighten up slightly so your hips and torso create a 45° angle. Lift the barbell up to your chest, then lower it to your knees. Avoid using momentum to bounce the bar up and down—work to control it all the way up to your chest and all the way back down. [18] X Research source Because you’re not resetting after each lift, it’s better to use a lighter weight for this exercise. [19] X Research source Try this variation if : you want to change things up from a Pendlay row."

      "content": "One-arm dumbbell row: Place your left hand and left knee on a weight bench and hold a free weight in your right hand just beneath your shoulder. Keeping your core tight, lift your arm up and back until the weight is near your stomach. [20] X Research source Try this variation if : you’re dealing with back pain that makes bent-over or Pendlay rows difficult. It’s also good for isolating the muscles on one side of your body, which can be helpful if you’re trying to correct an imbalance."

      "content": "You set the bar down between reps for the Pendlay row, but not the barbell row. The floor touch is what separates the Pendlay row from other rowing exercises. By stopping the barbell completely, you won’t be able to use momentum to lift it back up, so you’ll have to rely more on muscle strength for each lift. [21] X Research source Additionally, you hinge at the hips a bit further for the Pendlay row since you have to set the bar back down. With barbell and bent-over rows, your torso is less parallel to the ground. [22] X Research source"

      "title": "Improve pulling strength",
      "content": "Improve pulling strength Because the Pendlaw row requires an explosive movement and there’s no momentum to help you, it’s especially effective at isolating the muscles that help with a pulling motion. If you’re strength training, this added pulling power can help you lift heavier weights over time. [26] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Build back muscles",
      "content": "Build back muscles Because you’re not using momentum to lift, the Pendlay row requires you to rely fully on your muscle strength. This can help develop muscles that are otherwise hard to isolate, so you may notice more gains in your upper back and shoulders. [27] X Research source The added strength in your back muscles may also help you maintain better posture. [28] X Research source"

      "title": "Lift heavier weights",
      "content": "Lift heavier weights Try the Pendlay row if you want to lift heavier weights. Because you’re resting the bar on the floor between lifts, you may find that you can use heavier weights when you lift using the Pendlay row than if you’re lifting with a bent-over barbell row. [30] X Research source Increase the weight you lift gradually until you find what’s comfortable for you. When you’re lifting heavier weights , don’t add more than 10% of the previous weight at a time. [31] X Research source So if you’re able to comfortably lift 100 lb (45 kg), you might move up to 105–110 lb (48–50 kg)."

      "title": "Avoid back pain",
      "content": "Avoid back pain The Pendlay row may be helpful if you tend to get lower back soreness after you lift. In a Pendlay row, the bar rests on the ground each time you lower it. Because you get a chance to pause before each lift, it’s easier to make minor adjustments that can help you avoid straining your back. [32] X Research source If you have serious back pain, only lift if your doctor advises it, and work with a spotter."
