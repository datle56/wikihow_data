    {
      "title": "Use an up-to-date map.",
      "content": "Use an up-to-date map. Make sure that you are using an up to date map to study. Look for maps on reputable, regularly updated websites online, and print one out if you prefer to study a paper map. Otherwise, consider buying a new map to study at an office supply store, book store, or online. For instance, visit the National geographic website at https://maps.nationalgeographic.com/maps for accurate, up-to-date world maps."

      "title": "Go by continent.",
      "content": "Go by continent. To keep from being overwhelmed, focus on only one or two continents at a time while studying. Trying to cover the entire map at once will break up your concentration and make memorization more difficult. If necessary, cover the parts of the map you are not concentrating on to keep your eyes focused. [1] X Research source For example, devote each day of the week to studying one of the seven continents: Africa, Antarctica, Asia, Australia, Europe, North America (including Central America) and South."

      "title": "Prioritize countries you have trouble identifying.",
      "content": "Prioritize countries you have trouble identifying. Isolate the countries that you have trouble remembering and give them extra attention when studying (e.g. note the other countries and bodies of water surrounding them). Make a list of all of the countries that you make three or more guesses about without getting the right answer. When testing yourself, make a point to identify the countries you have difficulty remembering first, rather than the ones you recognize easily. [2] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Quiz yourself alphabetically.",
      "content": "Quiz yourself alphabetically. To reinforce your knowledge of where countries are located on a world map, quiz yourself alphabetically. Choose a continent and try to name each country in it in alphabetical order. By making the studying process more complex, you will sharpen your focus on the material and challenge yourself more thoroughly. [3] X Research source It can also be helpful to have a friend or family member quiz you, which can be more challenging. They don’t have to quiz you alphabetically. Instead, they could ask a question like, “Which countries border Laos?” or “What’s the southernmost country in South America?”"

      "title": "Tie in current events.",
      "content": "Tie in current events. Use new stories and global current events to contextualize the countries you are trying to place. For instance, look up and memorize countries that are currently in the headlines to get a better sense of the geographical context of those news stories. Alternatively, if there are countries that you are having trouble memorizing on the world map, search them in Google News to get more information about them and create stronger mental associations."

      "title": "Use the method of Loci.",
      "content": "Use the method of Loci. Try using the method of Loci, a technique used by Roman orators to remember long speeches, to memorize countries on a world map. Picture the countries of a continent within the framework of a familiar building (e.g. your home or workplace). Imagine memorable things happening in each room, section, or hallway, and assign countries from the map accordingly. Make the narrative memorable enough to stick in your mind and call up the connections you make with the world map. [4] X Research source For example, associate countries in Europe with your colleagues' cubicles at work, and imagine an absurd narrative that will help you remember (e.g. remembering Portugal and Spain by picturing a co-worker's cubicle, which has shrunk in size and holds a child-sized desk and chair, located at the corner of another co-worker's cubicle which is large enough to accommodate flamenco dancers."

      "content": "Create a mnemonic device. Mnemonic devices are silly phrases or rhymes that help you remember the order of things. They don’t have to make sense, and sometimes if the phrase is really wacky it is easier to remember. Try creating mnemonic devices to remember the order of certain countries from north to south or west to east. For instance, a mnemonic device used to list the countries in Central America from north to south is: Baby Goats Eat Ham, Not Cold Peanuts. The phrase provides the first letter of each country (Belize, Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama)."

To make a more interactive map, hang a large map on a cork bulletin board so that you can mark countries with push pins while studying. Look for wall maps (as well as a bulletin board and push pins) at an office supply store, or online. [10] X Research source"
