After shifting into Neutral, Autosteer or Traffic-Aware Cruise Control will be automatically turned off."

If you’re in Drive, push the gear stalk up, and if you’re in Reverse, push the gear stalk down.

There’s no gear stalk in Models S and X made after 2021, so all shifting is done on your control panel.

Use jumper cables and another car to jump-start the 12-volt battery, which is located under the hood in the front of the car. [3] X Research source Or, charge your car at a charging station or at home. Once your car has just enough power to turn on, start the car and then hold the gear shift for 2 seconds. If your car won’t start or you aren’t able to jump-start it, try disengaging the parking brake to shift it into Neutral."
