      "content": "Select a stem that has at least 2-3 leaves. Check for a tall stem that’s actively climbing and growing, with the leaves widely spaced apart. Aim to take your cutting close to the tip of the stem, which is where most of the new growth will be happening. You’ll want the part you cut to have at least 2 leaves, but try to leave a few green leaves behind on the remaining stem. [5] X Research source A stem that still has leaves on it will usually grow a new tip after you take a cutting. If you want to grow lots of little pitcher plants, cut an entire stem instead of just the tip. However, only do this if the plant has a healthy basal rosette (a circle of leaves at the base of the plant) so that it can keep growing new stems and pitchers."

      "content": "Cut a section of stem with at least 1 node. Nodes are tiny leaf buds growing out of the stem, just above each mature leaf. If you cut a long stem, you can separate it into sections and plant each section. Whether you do that or just take the tip of the stem, make sure there’s at least 1 growing node on each section you plan to plant. Use a clean, sharp razor blade or scalpel to make your cuts. [6] X Expert Source Jon Rowland Plant Specialist Expert Interview. 7 September 2021. Cut the stem underwater so that air bubbles don’t form in the cut stem and block water absorption. [7] X Research source You’re more likely to get good growth from a stem section that has at least 2-3 nodes on it. Cut off the bottom leaf of the stem segment, but leave any other leaves in place. Some gardeners recommend cutting the remaining leaves in half to help the plant retain water as new roots form. You can also lightly brush a little fungicide onto the stem and leaf cuts with a cotton swab to prevent infections."

Pour the medium into a pot and dampen it. Don’t water it so much that it’s soggy, or your cuttings could get moldy. Push the end of the cut stem into the potting medium deep enough so that there’s at least one growing node under the soil surface. [8] X Research source If you use coir, make sure the label states that it has been well-rinsed with rainwater. Otherwise, it might be too salty for your cuttings. Some horticulture hobbyists like to root Nepenthes cuttings in water. However, for this to work, you’ll need to change the water frequently to prevent rot. Adding an aerator, such as a fish tank bubbler, may also help."

After about a month, try very gently tugging on the stem of the potted cutting. If it resists, then new roots are forming. If there’s no new root growth, don’t worry. Wait a few more weeks and check again. Once you see clear signs of growth at the top of the cuttings—such as new leaf buds—you can safely transplant them to a new pot or outdoor growing area. As long as the leaves on your cutting are still green, there’s still hope that it will grow roots. Don’t worry if it takes a long time—some Nepenthes cuttings can take several months to root. [10] X Research source If you’re growing several cuttings in the same container, pull out any dead cuttings as soon as you notice them so they don’t spread rot. If you plan to replant the cuttings outdoors, give them time to acclimate by putting them outside for just a few hours a day at first."
