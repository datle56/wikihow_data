It's a large spaceship level with plenty of vents for impostors to escape. It also has security cameras that can be viewed from the security room. Mira HQ: This is a smaller map with an interconnected vent system spanning the entire map, giving the impostors plenty of opportunities to get around the level and cut off other players. It also has a decontamination room that slows down crewmates. Polus: This is a large map with two decontamination rooms and also has cameras that cover a large area of the map. This map is better for experienced players. Airship: This is an extremely confusing map with a unique shape. There are no visuals, allowing crewmates to take a random vote if needed. It also features new transportation including a platform, and three ladders. In addition, this is the first time you can see yourself on security when using cameras. The security acts the same as security on Polus. This also includes multiple areas to fix the sabotage of lights, allowing much less time for an impostor to get away. Crewmates, beware: impostors are very prone to chasing in this map. Only the best of the best should ever try this map."

In Among Us lobbies, the usage of slang terms and abbrevations are very common, as it's often crucial to type in your responses on time. Be on the lookout for the following words: Sus = suspicious Crew = crewmate Imp = impostor Ss = shapeshifter Eng = engineer Elec = electrical Safe = probably not the impostor; for instance, if other players claim to have seen them scan. (Note that this doesn't always mean a player is crewmate, as the person vouching for them could be an impostor.) Self / self rp = self report, claiming the person killed someone and then reported the body. Crewpostor = derogatory term for a bad crewmate, implying that they're practically playing for the impostors' side (less commonly used for a bad impostor) Gg = good game (note that this is a common term in multiplayer games and not exclusive to Among Us) Visuals/visual = a visual task which can't be faked, because other crewmates can see you do it (and impostors can't do tasks).

If an emergency meeting is called, crewmates will have the opportunity to vote on who they think might be an imposter. Whoever gets the most votes is ejected from the ship. If all imposters are ejected from the ship, or all tasks are completed, the crewmates win.

To sabotage, tap the Sabotage button in the lower-right corner to display a red map with various sabotage options instead of tasks, then tap on the room you want to sabotage. The different types of sabotages that you can perform are: Lock doors (X-ed out symbol): This is only on Skeld, Polus and Airship (on Skeld, doors will reopen automatically after a few seconds, but on Polus and Airship, they must be unlocked again manually). Cut the Lights (Lightning symbol): This effectively blinds crewmates as their FOV shrinks to a small circle immediately around themselves; to fix it, players must go to a panel in Electrical (Skeld & Polus) or in the Office (Mira HQ), or Gap Room in Airship, and flip the switches so all the green indicators turn on). Deactivate Communications/Comms (Wi-Fi symbol): This hides crewmate tasks, the task bar, and prevents the use of the Admin Table, Cameras (Skeld Airship & Polus only), and Door Logs (Mira HQ only; clears logs and prevents new ones from being recorded), and the Vitals Monitor (Polus only). On Skeld and Polus and Airship, this is fixed by turning a dial until the displayed frequency resembles a sine wave, while on Mira HQ, it's fixed by entering a 5-digit passcode in both the Office and Communications rooms (the code resets every 10 seconds). Oxygen Depletion (O 2 symbol; Skeld & Mira HQ only): This is a critical sabotage that forces the crewmates to fix it within the time limit (30 seconds on Skeld, 45 seconds on Mira HQ), or lose the game. To fix it, players must enter a 5-digit passcode in two separate locations (O 2 and Admin on Skeld, Greenhouse, and Hallway on Mira HQ). Reactor Meltdown (Skeld & Mira HQ)/Reset Seismic Stabilizers (Polus; Radiation symbol): This is a critical sabotage that forces the crewmates to fix it within the time limit (30 seconds on Skeld, 45 seconds on Mira HQ, 60 seconds on Polus), or lose the game. To fix it, two crewmates must simultaneously place their hands on two separate scanners located in the reactor room (Skeld & Mira HQ), or at the top left and middle of the map (Polus).

Your kill cooldown freezes while you're in a vent, looking at the emergency button, using systems such as the Admin table, or resolving sabotages. The kill range also depends on the host's settings and ranges from short to long. Avoid killing in front of crewmates.
