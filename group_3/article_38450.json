      "title": "Toss your salad with tahini for an alternative to creamy salad dressing.",
      "content": "Toss your salad with tahini for an alternative to creamy salad dressing. Add 1–2 US tbsp (15–30 mL) of tahini to your salad. Toss the salad using tongs or a salad spoon and fork until it is coated evenly. Tahini has a very strong flavor, so it’s a good idea to start with a little bit and see how your salad tastes. You can always add more if you want a stronger flavor. Tahini is made of ground sesame seeds. Hummus gets a lot of its flavor from tahini. You could also try using a couple spoonfuls of hummus as a creamy dressing if you have some handy."
