      "title": "Say V as W.",
      "content": "Say V as W. The consonant v is pronounced as the English 'w' as in water. The word via (road), is pronounced \"wi-a.\" Original Latin texts used the letter V in place of the vowel U as well (since the letter U did not exist). Modern Latin textbooks typically update the text to use the letter U for the vowel, and V only as the consonant."

      "content": "Pronounce i or j as y when it is a consonant. Latin did not originally have the letter j , but some modern writers use it to avoid confusion. If J does appear, it is always pronounced \"y\" as in \"you.\" If you are reading Latin as it was originally spelled, the letter i is sometimes this consonant \"y,\" and sometimes a vowel. For example, the name Iulius or \"Julius\" is pronounced \"Yoo-lee-us.\""

      "content": "Standardize your pronunciations of other consonants. Unlike in English, each Latin letter is almost always pronounced in a consistent way: [1] X Research source C is always hard, as in \"cat.\" cum (with) = koom G is always hard, as in \"goal.\" ago (I drive) = ah-go S is always a voiceless \"s\" sound as in \"snake.\" spuma (foam) = spoo-ma R is always rolled . This sound doesn't exist in most English dialects, so beginners can pronounce this as they would normally say \"R.\""

      "content": "Keep your H an H. The only tricky part about a Latin h is that it always stays an h! Don't get fooled by combinations like \"th\" or \"ch\" — they do not have any special meaning in Latin. Just pronounce the first consonant as you would normally. If you want perfect pronunciation, try to include the h by making the following vowel breathier, as in \"ho t h ouse\" or \"u ph ill\" [2] X Research source"

[3] X Research source Enunciate to keep the sounds distinct. For example, Classical Latin \"t\" is always pronounced clearly as a hard \"t,\" never softening to a sloppy \"d\" sound.

If you want to become a Latin pronunciation expert, these are covered in the extra rules later on."

      "title": "Find a textbook that marks long and short vowels.",
      "content": "Find a textbook that marks long and short vowels. The easiest way to learn how to pronounce Latin vowels is to read texts designed for students. Each Latin vowel has a long and short pronunciation. Introductory textbooks often mark the long vowels with a macron (horizontal line) over the vowel, so a is always the short pronunciation and ā is the long one. [5] X Research source If your main goal is to speak Church Latin, now's a good time to skip down to that section , since the vowel pronunciations are quite different. If you cannot find a text like this, speak with an advanced Latin student to get familiar with vowel pronunciation. Most students learn this best through practice and memorization, but you can look up the complex rules for identifying long and short vowels if you prefer that method."

Latin pronunciation is much more standardized than English, so you do not have to guess at a vowel sound. These combinations are always pronounced as diphthongs: [8] X Research source AE as the word eye. saepe (often) = sai-peh AU as the word ow. laudat (he/she/it praises) = low-daht EI as in ray. eicio (I accomplish) = ay-kee-oh OE as in oil. In all other vowel combinations, pronounce the vowels as separate syllables. tuus (your) = tu-us A combination of short and long vowels do not produce dipthongs. \"poēta\" (poet) = po-ay-tah"

Most Latin students learn to recite poetry eventually, and learning it early helps you with pronunciation as well: [9] X Research source If a syllable has a long vowel or a diphthong, it is heavy. If a syllable is followed by a double consonant, it is heavy. The letter x counts as a double consonant (ks). If neither of those is true, the syllable is light. (Some teachers refer to this as \"long\" and \"short\" syllables, but it's important not to confuse them with long and short vowels.)"

Abutor (I squander) is pronounced ah-BOO-tor because the penult has a long vowel. Occaeco (I make blind) is pronounced ok-KAI-ko because the penult has a diphthong (ae). Recusandus (that which must be rejected) is pronounced reh-koo-SAN-dus because the penult is followed by a double consonant (nd)."

Stress the third-to-last syllable instead, called the antepenult. Praesidium (guard) is pronounced prai-SI-di-um. The penult is light, so the accent falls on the syllable before it."

Its pronunciation has changed in some respects to match modern Italian, which, after all, is a form of Latin filtered through millennia of change. One of the most noticeable differences from Classical Latin is the appearance of these sounds: [13] X Research source If C appears before ae, e, oe, and i, pronounce it ch as in chain (instead of a hard c as in cat). In the same context, G is soft as in gem instead of hard as in goat. SC becomes sh as in sheep instead of sc as in scold. CC becomes tch as in catchy instead of cc as in accord. XC becomes ksh instead of ksk."

The exact pronunciation can vary by congregation, so if you follow someone's lead or go with your instincts, you'll probably be fine. Singers especially tend to holding the same sound for a longer or shorter time instead of changing the quality of the vowel. When in doubt, use the following system: [14] X Research source A as in father. E as in red. I or Y as the \"ee\" in sleep. O as in for (not as in go). U as the \"oo\" in boot."
