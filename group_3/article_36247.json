[1] X Research source Use a nail tip clipper or a regular pair of nail clippers to trim off the tips. [2] X Research source Try to avoid filing too close to your nail plate or cuticle. [3] X Research source Your goal is just to take off the clear coat so the acetone can access the polish and glue underneath. Apply a layer of petroleum jelly around each cuticle after you’re done to protect your skin from the acetone.

      "content": "Wrap your nails with acetone-soaked cotton balls and aluminum foil. Soak a cotton ball in 100% pure acetone and set it over the nail. Cut a 3 by 3 in (7.6 by 7.6 cm) piece of aluminum foil and wrap it around the nail to hold the cotton ball in place and prevent the acetone from evaporating. Repeat for every nail. Leave the foil on for 15 to 20 minutes. [5] X Research source Instead of aluminum foil, you can also use gel nail remover clips . Simply open the clip and slip it over your finger and the acetone-soaked cotton ball. [6] X Research source Alternatively, use a cotton round or folded paper towel soaked in acetone. If you don’t have any of these supplies on hand, soak your fingers in a small bowl of acetone for about 5 minutes instead. Soak for longer if needed to remove all the gel. [7] X Research source Cover your nails in hot towels while they’re wrapped in the aluminum to speed up the gel removal process."

Scrape off the leftover gel with a cuticle pusher and buff the rest off with a 180-grit nail file.

Turn on the e-file and carefully float the bit over the polish on your nail plate, moving from the cuticle down to the tip to grind the color away. [11] X Research source Try not to push the e-file into your nail. Instead, imagine that you’re trying to remove nail polish from an egg—you don’t want to push hard enough to break through the surface.

Gently glide the file from the cuticle down to the tip of the nail, removing as much of the leftover polish and glue as possible. Move carefully near the cuticle to avoid damaging it.

Fill a medium-sized bowl (or two small bowls) with warm water and add a squirt or two of regular dish soap and about 2 US tbsp (30 mL) of cooking oil. Mix the solution, then soak your nails in the water for about 10 minutes. [15] X Research source If you have acetone on hand, stir about 1 US tbsp (15 mL) into the mixture before soaking. Hard gel (or builder gel) cannot be soaked off—it can only be filed off. However, Gel-X nails are made of soft gel, which means they can be soaked off with acetone or water. [16] X Research source"

      "content": "Gel manicures tend to lift up off the natural nail after 2 to 3 weeks. Gel nails do eventually start to lift up off your nail plate, especially near the cuticle. However, when your nails start to lift up, it’s best not to pick or peel the rest of it off. This can remove the top layer of your natural nails and cause them to become dry, rough, and brittle. [24] X Research source Nail artist Mia Rubie says gel manicures can cause your nails to become brittle if “you're peeling your gel off or picking it off and then removing layers of the nail… in the process.” If you notice your nail starts to peel up, try one of the methods above to remove it or visit a professional to repair them. Oil your natural nails daily with cuticle oil to prevent them from separating from your gel nails."

      "content": "Gel-X manicures tend to be safer for your nails than acrylics. While gel nails like Gel-X can cause your natural nails to peel or become brittle, they’re more flexible than acrylic nails. This means gel nails are less likely to cause your natural nails to crack. However, using acetone to remove them without repairing your nails after can also cause damage. [25] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Dermatology Professional organization made of over 20,000 certified dermatologists Go to source Gel nails also don’t require as much drilling to remove them. [26] X Research source Gel-X nails are applied with a gel (not glue) and filed down to the shape you want, while acrylic nails require an acrylic monomer/liquid or acrylic powder.
