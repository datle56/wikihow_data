      "content": "Make a note of the length of time you were able to hold the squat position. If you held a squat with proper form for under 20 seconds, your legs are considered relatively weak. Remaining in the squat position for 20 to 35 seconds means your leg strength is average. If you held for 35 seconds or longer, your leg strength is strong."

      "content": "Make a note of the number of squats you were able to do. If you did less than 10 squats, your legs are relatively weak. If you performed 10 to 20 squats, your leg strength is average. Your legs are strong if you are able to do 20 to 30 squats. If you were able to perform over 30 squats, your legs are in excellent shape. Recording how many squats you are able to complete will help you to determine how much your lower body strength has increased after working them out. Repeat this test periodically."

      "content": "Measure the distance between the standing reach height and the maximum jump height based on the distance between the 2 points. A distance under 8 inches (20.3 cm) signals poor leg strength. If the distance ranges between 8 to 20 inches (20.3 to 50.8 cm), your leg strength is average. Anything over 20 inches (50.8 cm) means your leg strength is strong."
