      "title": "Hold a can of beer horizontally.",
      "content": "Hold a can of beer horizontally. Lay the can on a table or hold it in your hand so it’s sideways. This will move the air bubble inside to the side of the can rather than at the top and will waste less beer as you make the hole. [1] X Research source Use a light beer. It will be more difficult to drink a heavy or flavorful beer quickly."
    },
    {
      "title": "Position the hole 1 in (2.5 cm) from the bottom of the can.",
      "content": "Position the hole 1 in (2.5 cm) from the bottom of the can. The aluminum here is soft and you’ll be able to puncture the can with ease. The metal closer to the bottom of the can is more difficult to punch due to its shape. [2] X Research source If you’re right-handed, place the hole to the left of the tab so you can easily open in later. If you’re left-handed, punch the hole to the right of the tab."
    },
    {
      "title": "Tilt the can until you feel an air bubble under your thumb.",
      "content": "Tilt the can until you feel an air bubble under your thumb. Press on the can until you feel a pocket of air inside the can. Push a slight dent in the can so you know exactly where you want to punch the hole. [3] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Use a key or knife to puncture the can easily.",
      "content": "Use a key or knife to puncture the can easily. Hold the end of the key over the dent you’ve made with your finger. In one swift motion, push down so it pops a hole in one side of the can. Expect some beer and foam to shoot out of the hole once it’s punctured. [4] X Research source You can use any sharp object to make the hole, but be careful not to poke all the way through the can."
    },
    {
      "title": "Push confidently with your thumb if you don’t have a tool.",
      "content": "Push confidently with your thumb if you don’t have a tool. Use your palm and your fingers to brace the other side of the can as you push in. Move your thumb towards the bottom of the can to avoid scraping your thumb on the aluminum. Don’t be timid when using your thumb. Push hard right from the start and the can will open. Be careful when taking your thumb out from the can. The metal may be sharp and could cut your finger."
    },
    {
      "title": "Make the hole the size of a dime.",
      "content": "Make the hole the size of a dime. Use the edge of the object you used to puncture the can to resize the hole. Bend the metal so the sharp edges are inside the can. The larger hole you make, the easier it will be for you to drink the beer; just make sure you can fit your mouth around it. If you’ve punched a hole with your thumb, the hole is probably large enough already."
    },
    {
      "title": "Place your mouth over the hole.",
      "content": "Place your mouth over the hole. Keep the beer can horizontal so the hole is facing up and bring it to your mouth. Make sure you cover the entire hole so no beer drips out. [5] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Tilt the can to a vertical position.",
      "content": "Tilt the can to a vertical position. Let gravity do most of the work for you. Make sure you have a hand on the tab so you can open it right as the can is vertical. You may want to tilt your head to the side to make it easier. [6] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Pop the tab open with your other hand.",
      "content": "Pop the tab open with your other hand. Don’t suck any of the beer out until the tab is open. Use your dominant hand to pop the tab quickly. Opening the tab will let air go through the can so it doesn’t create a vacuum and deform the can. [7] X Research source Beer will start to flow smoothly from the hole, but if you want to drink faster, you can suck it out with your mouth."
    },
    {
      "title": "Drink the beer",
      "content": "Drink the beer as fast as you can. Take a deep breath before you start chugging the beer . Tilt your head back to help pour out the beer. It will come out quickly, so try not to let too much fill your mouth before swallowing it. Once the beer is gone, move the can away from your mouth and dispose of it responsibly. [8] X Research source Keep your throat open so you can easily pour it down rather than sucking the can and gulping. Drinking a beer this way will make you feel intoxicated fast. Set a limit for yourself and be aware of how your body reacts."
