      "content": "Gather up to 6 players and split yourselves into 2 teams. Pétanque is played with 2 teams, with up to 3 players on each team. Round up an even number of players, then divide into teams. [1] X Research source If you have an odd number of players, have someone switch out for another player each round, or have them sit out until the next game."

      "content": "Pass out the 12 boules to the members of each team. For 6 players, or “triples,” hand each player 2 Pétanque boules , or the large metal balls that you’ll throw to play the game. For 4 players, or “doubles,” hand each player 3 boules. To play 1-on-1, or “singles,” give both players 3 boules (playing with only 6 boules total). Set aside the target ball, known as the “cochonnet” or “jack,” which is about 3 cm (1.25 in) in diameter. Official pétanque boules are metal, about 3 inches (7.5 cm) in diameter, and weigh about 700-800 g (1.5 pounds). [2] X Research source Alternatively, play with Bocce balls . You might not get the official pétanque experience, but the game will be perfectly playable."

      "title": "Draw a circle on the ground wherever you’re playing the game.",
      "content": "Draw a circle on the ground wherever you’re playing the game. Find a large area clear of any obstacles like trees or shrubs. To play on a regulation pétanque pitch, mark off an alley 15 by 4 metres (49 by 13 ft) large using string or rope. Then make the circle about 0.5 metres (20 in) in diameter about 1 metre (3.3 ft) away from one end of the pitch. Use a bit of string, draw it in the dirt, or even use a hula hoop to mark the circle. [3] X Research source Whenever any player is throwing, they must stand in the circle, and both of their feet must be planted on the ground. Play without marking the pitch boundaries for a more casual game. Play pétanque on any surface, from sand to grass to gravel. For a more beginner-friendly game, opt to play on a short-trimmed lawn, where the boules can roll comfortably."

Aim for it to land between 6-10 m (20-33 ft) away from the circle, and at least 1 m (3 ft) away from any object (like a tree) that might interfere with a player's swing. [5] X Research source Measure the distance of the throw with a measuring tape . If the throw is more or fewer than 6-10 m away, the other team tries to throw within that range. Continue alternating until one team successfully throws the jack."

Try to roll your boule close to the jack (“pointing”), or try to hit the opponent's boule away from the jack (“shooting”). The team that has a boule closest to the jack is “holding the point.” [7] X Research source Throw the boule low and parallel to the ground when trying to shoot your opponent’s boules away. Toss your boule high in the air to increase your accuracy. This way, your boule won’t roll very far, and instead bounce in place."

Alternate players until you either have the point, or you run out of boules to throw. Once you gain the point, the next player on the other team throws to try to regain the point. [8] X Research source For example, if Team B tosses a boule and it doesn’t land closer to the jack than Team A's boule, then Team B tosses another boule. This continues until they get a boule closer to the jack than Team A's boule, or run out of boules."

The winning team gets 1 point for each of their boules that is closer to the jack than the losing team’s closest boule. The losing team doesn't score any points. [10] X Research source Use a measuring tape to more accurately judge which team’s boules are closer. For example, if Team A has 3 boules closer to the jack than Team B’s closest boule, Team A scores 3 points."

The team that won the last round draws a new circle on the ground, around the place where the jack was in the last round. Then, the winning team also throws out the jack from the circle, using the same technique as before. The winning team from the previous round goes first, and play resumes. [11] X Research source Toss the jack the opposite direction from where it was tossed the first time, so that the game alternates in a back-and-forth direction."
