      "content": "Use \"prends soin\" to tell a close friend or relation to take care. This is the informal, singular way to say \"take care\" in French. As such, it is only useful for talking to one person who you are familiar with. [2] X Research source Warning: this is very rarely used and you will sound clumsy, awkward. To avoid this, add \"de toi\" at the end of the sentence (pronounced \"deh touah\") Pronounced \"pron swan.\" It sounds bit like a stereotypical French accent saying the English name \"Bronson.\" Try to barely pronounce the final \"n\" sound in soin."

      "title": "Use \"prenez soin\" to tell multiple people or a formal acquaintance to take care.",
      "content": "Use \"prenez soin\" to tell multiple people or a formal acquaintance to take care. \"Prenez\" is the vous form of \"prendre,\" which means \"to take.\" The vous form is for second-person plural (\"you all\") and for the formal tense (anyone you would call \"sir, \"ma'am,\" \"Mr,\" or \"Mrs\"). You can use \"prenez soin\" just like you would use the English expression \"take care:\" [3] X Research source It is more common to add \"de vous\" at the end of the sentence: \"prenez soin\" sound really weird. Pronounced \"pren-eh swan (deh vou)\" To be extra native sounding, you want a gravelly, guttural sound with the \"n' in prenez, like a stereotypical French accent."

      "content": "Add \"bien\" before \"soin\" to add positive emphasis. This is a simple and easy way to spice up your dialogue. Simply go from \"prenez soin de vous\" meaning \"take care,\" to \"prenez bien soin de vous\" meaning \"take good care.\" The change is subtle, but you can use it to mix up your phrases. [4] X Research source \"Bien\" is pronounced bee-en"

      "title": "Take care of someone or something with \"prendre soin de.\"",
      "content": "Take care of someone or something with \"prendre soin de.\" The de allows you to add a person, place, or thing, changing the expression to \"take care of ________.\" For example, \"prends soin de ma mère\" means \"take care of my mom.\" You'll need to conjugate prendre to make the phrase work, changing the verb depending on who you're talking to. Though it is irregular, it is an easy conjugation: Je Prends Tu Prends Il/elle/on Prend Nous Prenons Vous Prenez Ils/Elles Prennent [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Use the full expression \"take good care of yourself,\" by conjugating the phrase \"prendre bien soin de______.\" Just like in English, this is the longer version of the full goodbye. You'll need to conjugate the verb \"prendre,\" of course, to fit the subject of the person you're talking, as well as the subject. Informal: \"Prends bien soin de toi.\" Translates literally as \"take good care of yourself.\" Formal or Plural: \"Prenez bien soin de vous.\" Translates literally as \"take good care of yourself/yourselves.\" [6] X Research source"

You end up with \"Est-ce que tu prends (bien) soin de toi?\" which translates to \"Do you take (good) care of yourself?\" Est-ce que is pronounced \"es-suh-kuh.\" You can also use inversion to ask questions in French: \"prends-tu bien soin de toi?\" [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Use \"fais/faites attention à toi/vous\" for a slightly more neutral \"take care.\" Translating literally as \"watch/look out\" or \"take heed,\" this phrase is a bit less friendly than \"prends soin de toi\" As such, it is a great way to say goodbye to acquaintances or to interchange with \"prends soin de toi\" when you're looking for new vocabulary. Fais is pronouced \"fays,\" and faites is pronounced \"fehts.\" Singular/Informal: Fais attention à toi → Look out (for yourself). Plural/Formal: Faites attention à vous → Look out (for yourself). [8] X Research source \"Fais attention!\" is also used to warn people of danger, both in speech and on road signs. You do pronounce the \"s\" at the end of the first word, since \"attention\" starts with a vowel."
