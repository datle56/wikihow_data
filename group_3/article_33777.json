      "content": "Pick the time that works best for you. Many people find it helps to meditate first thing in the morning in order to start the day fresh and with a clear mind. Others like to meditate in the evening to help them relax and clear their mind before bed, or to meditate in the middle of the day in order to manage work stress. Any time is a good time to mediate. Pick the time that works for you."

      "content": "Wear comfortable clothing. The goal of meditation is to calm your mind and to transcend negative emotions. Loose, comfortable clothing will help to ensure you are distracted as little as possible by physical discomfort."

      "title": "Find a quiet place.",
      "content": "Find a quiet place. You will want to find a room where no loud noises or sudden interruptions will disturb your meditation. The room should be a comfortable temperature. Tibetan monks begin meditation by cleaning the room. You can make the room more relaxing and conducive to meditation by keeping it free of clutter."

      "title": "Make sure you will not be interrupted.",
      "content": "Make sure you will not be interrupted. Turn off your cell phone or pager. If you have a landline, turn off the ringer. Ask your family not to interrupt you during your session."

      "title": "Sit in a comfortable position.",
      "content": "Sit in a comfortable position. The classic mediation pose is with the legs crossed before you, hands folded in your lap, but it does not matter you sit does not matter so long as you are comfortable and your back is straight to allow you breathe deeply and fully. You may choose to sit on a pillow for comfort. You can also sit in a chair if you find that more comfortable or if you need back support."
    },
    {
      "title": "Relax your body.",
      "content": "Relax your body. Adopting the proper pose can help you to remain comfortable and relaxed as you meditate. Keep your head slightly bent forward, your teeth slightly apart, and your shoulders relaxed. It is best to keep your eyes half-closed, but if that is too distracting, you may close them. Put your tongue on the roof of your mouth and swallow. This will create a slight vacuum that will reduce saliva and the need to swallow."

      "title": "Set a minimum time you will meditate.",
      "content": "Set a minimum time you will meditate. Start with 15 minutes. Use a timer; you don't want to be glancing at the clock repeatedly. Try to last the entire time you have allotted, but if you get tired or too distracted, it's ok to stop."

      "title": "Understand why you are meditating.",
      "content": "Understand why you are meditating. You may have particular reasons you are meditating: to help you move past negative actions – e.g. fighting with your wife – or to deal with stress. Meditation can help by calming your mind and helping you to set aside negative emotions, particularly if you focus on one emotion at a time. In addition to considering your own reasons for meditation, you might consider starting your session with one of prayers that Buddhists use to remind them why they are meditating: Generating Bodhicitta: By virtue of giving and so forth, may I become a Buddha for the benefit of all sentient beings. (3x) The Four Immeasurables: May all sentient beings have equanimity, free from attachment, aggression and prejudice. [1] May they be happy, and have the causes for happiness. May they be free from suffering and causes for suffering. May they never be separated from the happiness that is free from suffering. (3x) The Seven-Limbed Prayer Respectfully I prostrate with body, speech and mind; I present clouds of every type of offerings, actual and imagined; I declare all the negative actions I have done since beginningless time, and rejoice in the merit of all Aryas and ordinary beings. Please teacher, remain until cyclic existence ends and turn the wheel of Dharma for all sentient beings. I dedicate the virtues of myself and others to the great Enlightenment."

      "title": "Focus on your breathing.",
      "content": "Focus on your breathing. Breathe through your nose. Concentrate on each inhalation and exhalation. Feel the rise and fall of your abdomen. Do not control your breath, simply be mindful of it. Clear your mind of everything but this focus on your breathing. The goal is to achieve peace and stillness of mind. You can count your breaths to ten to help focus. If you lose count, start over at one."

      "title": "Allow thoughts to come and go.",
      "content": "Allow thoughts to come and go. Thoughts will inevitably pop into your head, particularly when you are new to meditation. Don't be upset if they do. \"Do not try to stop thoughts, allow them to arise, but recognize their arising and do not pursue them. The goal is not to have no thoughts but for thoughts to arise and yet be rendered powerless\" (Garchen Ripoche). Let them leave your mind of their own accord."

      "title": "Learn to deal with common distractions.",
      "content": "Learn to deal with common distractions. Pain from sitting so long, sleepiness, desire and more can make it hard to meditate. Don't worry. Everyone experiences these things. The more you meditate, the better you will become at moving past distractions. Pain – If you feel discomfort, do not move. Study yourself and your pain. Allow time to explore the feeling. Imagine your body as empty, a vessel with you standing outside of it. If the pain is too intense, take a break by standing up. Sensual desire – It can be hard to put aside thoughts of a lover or even a desired object. Realize that desires are transient; fulfilling one will only lead to another. Remember the reality of the desired object: bodies are just skin and bones and flesh. [5] X Research source Restlessness and worry – Notice these feelings, but do not pursue them. Return your attention to your breathing and movement of your abdomen. If a thought persists, you may write a short note to remind yourself to deal with it later. Drowsiness – Remember why you are meditating. Focus on a white light between your eyebrows to increase wakefulness. If you still find yourself nodding off, take a rest and return to mediation when you are refreshed."

      "content": "Increase the length of your meditation. Begin by meditating for 15 minutes at a time, once a day. 15 minutes might seem long at first, but as you get better at relaxing and clearing your mind, it will get easier. Try to extend the length of your mediation by 5 minutes each week until you are able to mediate for 45 minutes."

There are three main techniques to inspire the proper emotions within you: [8] X Research source Mantras – As you think of yourself, then the other four people, repeat an internalized phrase or mantra, such as: \"May I be well and happy.

      "content": "Radiate feeling of love. Project your feelings of loving-kindness to the four points of the compass. It may help to think of people you know in cities in each direction that you can direct your love towards. The ultimate goal is to not have to direct your love in this way, but rather to simply radiate feelings of unconditional universal love in all directions. [10] X Research source It may help to use a mantra to direct you love outwards, such as: May all beings be safe, happy, healthy, live joyously….. May all living beings be safe, happy, healthy, live joyously….. May all breathing beings be safe, happy, healthy, live joyously….. May all individuals be safe, happy, healthy, live joyously….. May all beings in existence be safe, happy, healthy, live joyously…"
