      "content": "Adjust chair height so that your feet are flat on the floor. This will keep your knees and hips at roughly the same height. To find this height, stand by the chair and raise or lower the seat pan to just below your elbows bent between 90 and 110 degrees. Take care that your elbows are not winged out, but instead hang with your upper arms at a comfortable, fairly vertical alignment. Your forearms should be parallel to the ground and your wrists in a neutral position. Since most desks are fixed height, it is best to adjust the chair height for the correct position of the arms and hands. Then, if necessary, provide support for the feet so that the underside of the thighs are just supported at the edge of the seat. [2] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Some desks do adjust in height, so look to see if there is such an adjustment. Much modular office furniture (i.e. cubicles) allows for adjustment of work surface height, as well, although making this adjustment may require some work. Ask your employer or facilities department to help you adjust such a desk."

To help your wrists “float” over the keyboard, use a wrist rest; however, only use it if it actually elevates your wrists; depending on your position, this might actually encourage you to hold your hands at a bad angle. Many keyboards have tabs to raise the back, but check your wrist position before you use them. You may need to raise the front , instead. If your keyboard has no such adjustment, try propping up the front on a paint stick, a couple of erasers, or other such object."

However, if you wear bifocals and usually tilt your head back in order to look down through them at the monitor, lower the monitor (or raise your chair) so that the monitor sits 15 to 20 degrees below eye level; note that this may require you to tilt the screen slightly upwards toward your face.

You can also alternate left and right-sided mouse usage to dilute the effects of repetitive use. [9] X Research source Choose a mouse which is the right size for your hands.

Instead, position the document holder directly beneath the monitor, angling it between the monitor and keyboard. If you touch type and do a lot of transcription, consider placing the document holder in front of you, with the screen to one side. The main focus of attention is then straight ahead with occasional movements to view the screen. Another option would be to provide a lectern that is positioned between the keyboard and screen."
