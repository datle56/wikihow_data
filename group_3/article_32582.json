      "content": "Give your partner some flirty rules to follow. You are in charge. Take your time, take control, and take pleasure in teasing them. Remind your partner of these rules: At no point during your entire performance is your partner allowed to touch you. You can touch, lick, rub and caress him all you want. A slow seduction is a sure recipe for lap dancing success. The whole point of a lap dance is to drive your partner crazy with anticipation and desire. If they reach out in your direction or start to grind back, slap their wrist and let them know that if they do it again, the dance is over, no exceptions."

      "title": "Choose an outfit that makes you feel confident.",
      "content": "Choose an outfit that makes you feel confident. There’s a wide variety to choose from. From erotic dance-wear to bras, panties, garter-belts, stockings, chemises, robes, teddies, swimsuits, club-wear, fetish-wear, oversized button-up shirts, and so much more. The key is to build up a collection of layers that are easy to remove. Don’t be afraid to show some skin. [2] X Research source Underwear: these items will be the last to come off. You might try a sexy bra, g-string, stockings, and perhaps suspenders. Or, try full bottomed panties, thongs, g-strings and booty shorts to see which works best for you. Add sex appeal to any outfit with thigh-high stockings , worn with or without garters. If you plan to keep your stockings and garter on for the duration of your dance, wear your panties on the outside of the straps so that they can be removed without having to unhook your garters. Top layers: try a pair of hot pants, an innocent sheer robe, sexy teacher/student uniform, a dominatrix outfit , or a classic red or black evening dress with some retro lingerie underneath. Shoes : high heels and stilettos usually work best with any outfit. They make your legs look toned, sleek, and longer. Even if they’re slightly uncomfortable, give them a try because you won’t be wearing them for long anyway. Pro tip: A shirt with buttons can also be a very sexy item of clothing to remove. Play peek-a-boob with each side. When you’ve undone the last button, turn around posing at an angle, expose your one shoulder then the other and then let it slip down to the floor. Tight trousers or jeans can be difficult to remove. A pencil skirt can easily be unzipped and pushed down. Do this while bending forward with your back or side to him and then step out of it."

      "content": "Select sensual songs that you both enjoy. Think smooth and seductive. Avoid songs with high pitched vocals or fast beats. The crooners and divas of the 60s are a good place to start if you want something romantic. A sensual rhythm or beat will guide you through your dance. It's best if you can relate to the music and feel comfortable moving to its beat. Start by setting aside 2 or 3 songs. [3] X Research source Try songs like “Love to Love You Baby,” “Pony,” or “Hotter than Hell.” Song one is for the warm-up. This is your time to lead your partner to the chair, strut about, pose, explain the rules to your lover, and begin to slowly ease into your seductive performance. Don't feel pressured to start at the beginning of the song. Take your time, start when you're ready, walk around your lover, touch him, drag your fingers through his hair and feel the beat. By setting aside a selection of 2 or 3 songs, you won't feel pressured to rush because the song is coming to an end."

      "content": "Take your time. For beginners, you may want to start out by taking your time, work your way into a seductive groove. Close your eyes, feel the music, enter the trance and begin to sway. Dance on your feet and on the floor. These may be things you’ve never done before. Try sliding down a wall and then back up. Walk around on the tips of your toes. As long as you feel confident and enjoy what you’re doing, your partner will love it! On the floor, try opening and closing your legs or leaning your knees from one side to the other. Experiment with different angles. Sit on a chair. Caress your thighs, your neck, your belly, your feet. Close your legs and then open them using your hands to part your thighs. If you feel uncomfortable dancing, think of your performance as a slow aerobics session. Stretch, bend, split. Use your hands, stretch them out to the sides, and stroke your outstretched arm with the tips of your fingers. If you’ve practiced martial arts, yoga or Pilates, modify the poses that you’re familiar with to create your very own sexy moves."

Tease him with a shawl or a silky wrap or use it to cover up if you feel more comfortable being a little less exposed. If you’re wearing a button up shirt, consider also wearing a tie. Loop it around his neck to pull him closer to your face or cleavage or tie his hands up with it if he breaks the no touching rule. If you’re the kind of person that likes to be naughty, have your favorite toy at hand for your pleasure and his torture. Use your hair. While standing up, kneeling, or sitting, stretch your torso while you pull your hair up and let it fall again. Use it to brush up against him."
