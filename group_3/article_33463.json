      "content": "Assemble at least 7 players and assign a moderator. Werewolf is meant to be played with a large group of people, so gather up a minimum of 7 players and have them sit in a circle or around a table. Next, choose someone to be the narrator. The narrator oversees the game and walks the players through the game, but doesn’t actively participate themselves. [1] X Research source When playing more than 1 game of Werewolf, take turns being the moderator so that everyone gets a chance to play. If there are a large number of players, the moderator can use a notebook to write down the role of each player and who has been killed to keep track of the game."

      "content": "Shuffle the role cards and deal a single card to each player. Have the moderator give everyone a random role card, which represents the role that the player will take during each game of Werewolf. Count out cards for 1 Seer, 1 Doctor, 2 Werewolves, and enough Villager cards for the rest of the players. [2] X Research source If you’re playing with more than 15 people, add 1 werewolf card for every 4 players that are in the group. Alternatively, shuffle in bonus roles like the Witch or the Alpha Werewolf to mix up the game."

      "title": "Tell all of the players to close their eyes and drum the table.",
      "content": "Tell all of the players to close their eyes and drum the table. After the cards have been dealt to the players, the moderator announces the beginning of the night phase by saying, “Close your eyes.” Then, everyone slaps their knees or drums the table to mask any sounds other players might make in the round. [4] X Research source Each player keeps their eyes closed when it isn’t their turn. If any player opens their eyes or cheats, then they are out of the game."

      "content": "Have the werewolves choose who they want to kill. While the players are drumming their hands, the moderator says, “Werewolves, open your eyes.” The werewolves then open their eyes and silently point to who they want to kill. The 2 werewolves must agree on 1 villager. [5] X Research source When the werewolves make a decision and agree on a victim, the moderator takes note of who is being killed and says, “Werewolves, close your eyes.” The werewolves keep drumming while they decide so the other players don’t suspect them."

With the other players continuing to drum, the moderator says, “Doctor, who would you like to heal?” The person with the Doctor card then opens their eyes and chooses 1 person that will survive if the werewolves decide to kill them. The moderator takes note of who they select, and the Doctor closes their eyes again. [6] X Research source The Doctor can choose to save themselves if they want. The Doctor won’t know who the werewolves chose to kill. If someone was chosen to be killed by the werewolves and the Doctor chose to save them, the moderator will say, “Someone has been saved,” at the beginning of the day round."

Seer, pick someone to ask about.” The person with the Seer card then opens their eyes and points at 1 player that they think might be a werewolf. The moderator uses a silent gesture to let them know if they have identified a werewolf. The Seer then closes their eyes. [7] X Research source The moderator can give a thumbs up or nod their head to let the Seer know if they guessed correctly. In some versions of the game, such as One Night: Ultimate Werewolf, the Seer is allowed to view the card of the player of their choice instead of simply identifying whether a player is a werewolf or not."

Once all the roles have taken their turns, the moderator says, “Everybody open your eyes, it’s daytime.” The moderator then reveals the person who was killed, and whether or not they were saved by the Doctor. If they weren’t saved, they're eliminated! [8] X Research source Eliminated players remain silent for the rest of the game and do not reveal their identity. Alternatively, have the killed player reveal their card. This variation speeds up the game and makes it a bit easier for the villagers to win. Have fun role playing the event! The moderator might make up a story about how the player was killed, who might perform dramatic death throes."

The werewolf, Doctor, and Seer players are trying to hide their true identities. [9] X Research source For example, when it’s your turn, you could say something like, “Hi, I’m Chris, the local blacksmith. I’ve got a bunch of pitchforks sharpened and ready to hunt werewolves!” Role playing is a big part of the game, so have fun with it!"

The players can say whatever they want—promise, bluff, lie , or tell wild stories about who they are. The moderator then takes a vote, and the player that the majority of players believe is a werewolf is killed. That player is now out of the game. [10] X Research source Though there does not have to be a limit, to keep the game moving, set a 5-minute time limit for the day phase to force the other players to make a decision as to who they want to kill off. If the village runs out of time or they can’t reach a majority vote, then the round ends, nobody is killed, and the opportunity to potentially kill a werewolf is missed."

The night round repeats with the werewolves, seer and doctor playing their roles (if they’re still alive), and the game continues until either all the werewolves or all the other players have been eliminated. [11] X Research source The werewolves typically win the game if they kill enough villagers to make the numbers even, since at that point they have a clear path to winning. But let the game play our for fun, anyway!"

[12] X Research source If the Witch chooses to take action, they gesture which action they want to take by pointing at a player and then miming either resurrecting them or poisoning them. Get creative! If the Witch doesn’t want to act that night, they simply shake their head."
