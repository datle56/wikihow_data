      "content": "Read the clothing care label carefully, paying attention to the other fabrics listed. Many garments are made of a blend of fabrics. Depending on the blend, the shrinking process will be less effective. Most garments made with Spandex will recommend washing in lukewarm water and air drying. In order to shrink them, you will need to wash them on a higher temperature setting. [1] X Research source Natural fibers, such as cotton, tend to be more prone to shrinkage than synthetic materials, such as Spandex. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Place your Spandex in the washing machine and set it to its hottest setting. Spandex does not shrink under normal wash conditions, so you'll need to use the hottest setting. This is often the setting for \"heavy duty.\" [3] X Research source Turn the machine to its hottest setting and let it run a full cycle. You do not need to use detergent unless you also want to clean the garment."

      "content": "Try on the garment to see if it is the desirable size. Wait an additional 15 minutes after the dryer cycle has stopped before taking the Spandex out of the dryer. This way it will have time to cool so you do not burn yourself. If the garment has not reached the desired size, repeat this process. [5] X Research source"
