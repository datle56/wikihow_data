      "content": "Act naturally. You don't need to feign excitement. Instead, summon up a positive feeling by thinking how nice it was that someone is giving you a gift. Try to react immediately. If you pause after you open the gift, you might seem disappointed. Smile if you can. It might help to remind yourself that they were trying to make you happy!"

[1] X Expert Source Ashley Smith, PhD Licensed Clinical Psychologist Expert Interview. 22 October 2021. You might say, \"Thank you! I really appreciate this.\" You may comment on the kindness and generosity of the present by saying, \"What a generous present!\" or, \"How kind of you!\""

      "content": "Give the person a hug if you’re comfortable doing that. Hugging is a great way to say thank you. And if you’re a bad actor, hugging will let you hide your face (and your disappointment) without requiring you to say anything. A hug is truthful—it's a loving way for you to tell them you appreciate the love behind the gift. If you’re not normally on hugging terms with the person, this can seem insincere, so it’s best to only hug someone you’re normally close to."

      "content": "React to the intention behind the gift. If you struggle to bring a smile to your face to show gratitude for something you'll never use, or something you never wanted, try to appreciate the thought behind it. Smith says that it's always possible to offer a few words of thanks concerning the thought they put into it. [2] X Expert Source Ashley Smith, PhD Licensed Clinical Psychologist Expert Interview. 22 October 2021. \"Thanks so much! What a thoughtful present!\" \"I really appreciate that you thought of me!\" \"Thank you for these colorful socks; you know I like to keep my feet warm.\" \"Thanks for the CD! I'm always looking to expand my collection.\""

    {
      "title": "Ask questions to change the subject.",
      "content": "Ask questions to change the subject. Ask your giver about the gift and how they thought of it. This is a good distraction from discussing whether or not you'll use it, how often, etc. Ask them where they bought it, ask them if they've got one themselves, or ask how best to use it (if applicable). In general, when reacting to a gift you don't like, put the burden of the conversation on the person who is gifting, and not yourself. \"Do you have this CD too? What's your favorite track?\" \"I don't think I've ever seen socks like these; where did you get them? Do you have a pair yourself?\" \"I definitely don't have a sweater like this--how long did it take you to knit? How long have you been knitting?\""

      "title": "Defer questions to avoid lying.",
      "content": "Defer questions to avoid lying. If your gift giver senses you don't like the present, they may start asking you questions about whether you \"really\" like it, or when you will use it. Either tell a tiny lie or counter their questions with more questions so that you don't have to answer theirs. If you can, coax them into offering a suggestion on how or when to make full use of your gift. Then give a quick \"I'll be sure to do that\" and move on. In the case of a gift that is clearly mean-spirited, it's acceptable to throw any poise and respect out the window. Don't be afraid to tell them they can keep it."

      "content": "Fib if you’re not comfortable telling them the truth. If you don't have a moral issue with telling small lies to spare the feelings of well-intentioned people, go ahead and say you like it. Most people consider it polite to tell small lies about gifts rather than telling the giver you are disappointed. However, you should avoid telling a big lie. Say you love the present, but don't say it's the best present ever, or promise to use it every day. If you don't lie, just avoid saying that you hate the gift. \"Thank you! What a great present.\" \"This is wonderful, thank you! Where did you find it?\""

      "content": "Open the conversation by expressing gratitude for the gift. Even if you’re going to tell the person you don’t care for the gift itself, let them know how much you appreciate the fact that they gave you a gift at all. This will help soften the overall message. [3] X Research source For example, you could say, “It means so much to me that you remembered my birthday! Thank you.” Or, you might say, “I really appreciate that you went out of your way to brighten my day.”"

      "content": "Speak plainly and explain why the gift doesn’t suit you. After you thank them for the gift, be honest about the reason you didn’t care for the gift. Smith recommends keeping it simple by saying something like, \"I'm not really sure this gift is for me.\" [4] X Expert Source Ashley Smith, PhD Licensed Clinical Psychologist Expert Interview. 22 October 2021. \"You know I love music, but this is just really not my style. I'm more into [style of music].\" \"I can't thank you enough for knitting this for me, but I'm not sure it fits with anything in my wardrobe.\" \"I think I need to be honest: I've never found a way to pair any socks you've given me with anything I own. I can't thank you enough for the gift, but I've no use for any more socks like this.\""

      "content": "End the conversation by thanking them again. Repeating your appreciation may help take some of the sting out of the fact that you didn’t like their gift. Remind them that you really appreciate that they thought of you, so you can hopefully end the conversation on a positive note.

[5] X Research source That’s okay—try to control your own emotions so the situation doesn’t turn into an argument. If they seem a little quiet, try changing the subject to something positive, like saying, “Hey, I’m looking forward to that movie next week. Is your sister still coming with us?” If they react angrily, try saying, “I can tell that upset you, but I thought it was best to be honest. I’ll give you some space now.”"

      "content": "Respond immediately and firmly to stop unwanted gifts. If you don’t want the person to give you gifts at all, it may help to be firm and honest in the moment. For instance, if the person has a crush on you and you don’t like them back, it’s probably better to let them know right away. Fields says that the best way to handle an unwanted admirer is to tell them “in the kindest way that there isn’t that kind of chemistry” between you. [6] X Expert Source Michele Fields Matchmaker & Dating Coach Expert Interview. 17 August 2021. Smith agrees, advising that you should be open and honest, saying something like, “It makes me uncomfortable that you give me so many gifts.” [7] X Expert Source Ashley Smith, PhD Licensed Clinical Psychologist Expert Interview. 22 October 2021. If you’re feeling overwhelmed in the moment and you aren’t able to tell them you don’t want the gift, just say “Thank you,” then find a time to talk to them about it later."

      "content": "Send a thank you card about a week after receiving the gift. Sending a thank you card is good etiquette for any gift you receive, but in the case of a gift you didn’t like, it may help reassure the gift-giver that you appreciated their thoughtfulness. In your note, focus on the thought behind the gift. If you do want to address the gift, keep it simple, like, “I’m enjoying it.” [8] X Research source \"Thanks so much for coming over and spending some time. I can't believe you put all that effort into knitting something for me--thanks again.\" \"Just wanted to send my thanks for coming over the other night.

      "content": "Offer to give the gift back. Sometimes, people choose gifts based on what they like. Try asking the person if they’d like you to return the gift to them. Then, they can decide whether to keep the gift for themselves or return it to the store where they bought it. They may decline to take the gift back, and that’s okay."

Some stores will even accept a return if you don’t have a receipt at all. Then, you can purchase something else or get a refund. [9] X Research source If you’re not sure where the item was purchased, try asking the gift-giver something like, “I was thinking of getting my dad a shirt like the one you got me. Where did you find that?”"

      "content": "Re-gift it if you know someone else who would enjoy it. If you’re given a gift that doesn’t suit you but that would be perfect for someone else, consider passing it along. But this can be risky—even if you were honest about not liking the gift, the gift-giver may be offended if they find out that you regifted their present. [10] X Research source Try to re-gift outside of the circle that you share with the gift-giver. For instance, if your brother gave you a gift you don’t like, don’t re-gift it to your mom, or your brother may be more likely to find out. Instead, you might give it to a work friend who doesn’t know your brother at all."

If you pretend to like a gift that you don’t actually care for, you could end up getting more of that type of gift in the future. Being honest is the only way to ensure that the person won’t get you that type of gift anymore. [12] X Research source Being honest can help keep resentment from building up because you keep getting gifts you don't like."

Don't be afraid to even ask, \"What would you want to get?\" That might lead them to ask you what you’re hoping to get. Don’t be afraid to press them a little if they say something like, “Oh, whatever you pick is fine.” Try offering a few suggestions based on what you’d like as a subtle way to drop hints. Say something like, “Do you like scented candles? What about bath bombs?”"
