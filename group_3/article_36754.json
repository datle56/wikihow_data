If you can't relax, try to pee a little. This may relax the muscles enough to allow you to remove the tampon easily."

If the tampon does not come out easily or it is painful to remove, it may not need to be changed. Unless it's been 8 hours (in which case you should try the peeing trick to ease its removal), leave the tampon in another hour or two and then check it. [1] X Research source If you remove the tampon after 4-8 hours and there is very little blood, you may want to switch to a lower absorbency tampon or use panty liners instead. [2] X Research source"

Depending on how heavy your cycle is, you need to change out your tampon every 3-5 hours to avoid leaks. [4] X Research source Leaving a tampon in longer than 8 hours puts you at a higher risk for infection for Toxic Shock Syndrome (TSS), a rare but potentially deadly infection. [5] X Research source If you try to change your tampon and it still has a lot of absorbency or only has a little blood on it, try switching to a lower absorbency tampon. Always wear the tampon with the lowest possible absorbency for your flow. [6] X Research source"
