And even if your region doesn't restrict phone call recording, Samsung may not have implemented the call recording feature in your area. If you don't see the option to record phone calls in the Phone app, most third-party apps also won't work because of Google's API restrictions. So, you can't just go to the Play Store and download an app that claims to record phone conversations. If you do find a third-party app that works, it'll only be able to record your side of the conversation unless your Android is rooted ."
