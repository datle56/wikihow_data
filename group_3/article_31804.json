      "content": "Machiavellians Someone with a Machiavellian personality has no qualms about manipulating others to get what they want. They will often use exploitation and deception to get their desired results and often feel guilty if they end up hurting people in the process. Many are described as lacking emotions and empathy, so they don’t often care about how their actions might impact others. [5] X Research source Unlike narcissists, someone with a Machiavellian personality doesn’t strive to be the center of attention. The 16th-century philosopher Niccoló Machiavelli wrote a manifesto entitled “The Prince,” where he stated that deception, cunning-ness, and wickedness are more important in politics than virtue or morality. This gave birth to the term “Machiavellian.”"

In general, it’s a feeling of indifference towards others’ feelings, though each personality may differ in their abilities to recognize and perceive other people’s pain. Some aren’t able to recognize at all when another person is feeling hurt. On the other hand, others may be able to recognize a person’s pain, but they likely won’t take action to help that person.

This is especially true for dark empaths, who are able to read others’ emotions but usually have little desire to help them. Types of emotional manipulation include: [10] X Research source Gaslighting: Making someone doubt their memories or perceptions. For example, a dark empath might gaslight someone by saying, “I would never hurt you. You’re probably just stressed and aren’t thinking straight.” [11] X Research source Making the other person feel guilty: Causing a person to think that their actions are harming someone when they’re really not. An example would be saying something like, “If you loved me, you wouldn’t leave me.” Threatening: Making someone feel afraid so that they’ll do what another person wants. For example, someone might threaten another person by saying, “If you don’t want everyone to know your secret, you’ll do as I say.”"

An empath is someone who is highly sensitive to other people’s emotions and often feels those emotions as though they’re their own. For example, they may feel really excited when their friend is happy, even if they themselves aren’t doing too well. People usually think of empaths as very sensitive and caring. Some signs of empaths include: [18] X Research source Absorbing other people’s emotions and stress Becoming overwhelmed by lots of stimuli and multi-tasking Being able to accurately pick up on someone’s emotions based on their facial expressions or body language Becoming anxious or ill when others yell or give off a lot of negative emotions Being empathetic and being an empath are two different things. For example, while someone who is empathetic might be able to understand a person’s difficult situation with compassion, an empath might feel another person’s pain as though it’s their own. Empaths can differ greatly in how intensely they feel others’ emotions. For example, some may simply be more aware of others’ emotions and want to help others and give support. Others may even put themselves in harm’s way to protect someone. [19] X Research source"

Since empaths are more highly attuned to others’ emotions and more likely to step in and do what they can to help, they may end up falling for a narcissist’s tricks. If this continues, an empath might find it increasingly harder to break off the relationship, even if it’s turning toxic. [21] X Research source For example, a narcissist might claim that their partner no longer loves them in order to get the empath to focus even more of their attention on them. An empath might hold onto hope that their partner will change if they work hard enough, which may be a big reason that they stay in the relationship.

      "content": "Both partners’ low self-esteem can create a toxic relationship. Empaths might focus too much on others and thus have low self-esteem because of it. Narcissists, on the other hand, tend to cover up their low self-esteem by seeking attention and making everything about them. Oftentimes, narcissists will project these negative feelings onto their partner by saying degrading comments or being passive-aggressive. Since empaths absorb other people’s emotions so easily, this can be detrimental to their own feelings of self-worth. Some examples of narcissistic projecting include: [23] X Research source Accusing their partner of only thinking of themselves when they share a problem. Getting defensive when their partner points out something hurtful they said. For example, a narcissist might say something like, “I can’t believe you’d accuse me of something like that. Do you even care about my feelings?” Pointing out their partner’s mistakes unnecessarily. For example, a narcissist might say, “This place is a mess. You didn’t do any cleaning while I was gone?” when they themselves haven’t helped around the house in a long time."
