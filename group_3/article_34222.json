Once the wrap is in place, turn a hair dryer to a high heat setting and wave it over the surface of the bag. Continue heating the plastic until it clings to the surface of the shoe. [4] X Research source You can purchase shrink wrap bags online. Use these bags to wrap individual shoes, not pairs. Keep the hair dryer about 1 in (2.5 cm) from the surface of the plastic."
