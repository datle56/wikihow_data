When you get your Nexplanon implant, your healthcare provider will give you a user card that lists your insertion date as well as when you need to have the implant removed. This will be 3 years from the date of insertion, so it’s important to know this date and plan to have Nexplanon removed by then. For example, if you have Nexplanon inserted on October 10th, 2017, then you’ll need to have it removed by October 10th, 2020. If you can't find your user card, call your healthcare provider and ask them when the implant was inserted and when it needs to be removed."
