If you’re happy with your first dice roll, you can end your turn here (you can roll up to 3 times in a single turn of Yahtzee). Here’s a quick refresher of the different Yahtzee dice combos: [2] X Research source Aces: Having at least one 1 dice (point value: the sum of all your 1s) Twos: Having at least one 2 dice (point value: the sum of all your 2s) Threes: Having at least one 3 dice (point value: the sum of all your 3s) Fours: Having at least one 4 dice (point value: the sum of all your 4s) Fives: Having at least one 5 dice (point value: the sum of all your 5s) Sixes: Having at least one 6 dice (point value: the sum of all your 6s) 3 of a kind: Three identical dice (point value: the sum of all your dice) 4 of a kind: Four identical dice (point value: the sum of all your dice) Full House: A pair of identical dice and a trio of identical dice (worth 25 points) Small Straight: A 1, 2, 3, and 4; a 2, 3, 4, and 5; or a 3, 4, 5, and 6 (worth 30 points) Large Straight: A 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 or a 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 (worth 40 points) Yahtzee: Five identical dice (worth 50 points) Chance: Any assortment of 5 dice (point value: the sum of all your dice)"

The Lower Section includes 3 of a kind, 4-of-a-kind, Full House, Small Straight, Large Straight, Yahtzee, and Chance. Yahtzee scorecards come with multiple columns so they can be repurposed for multiple games of Yahtzee. As you play, record your scores in the same column. Don’t have a scorecard on hand?
