      "content": "Clean your glasses before dealing with the scratches. Go to the kitchen sink, turn it on, and make sure the water is room temperature. Place your glasses underneath the running water. Squeeze a small drop of dish soap onto your index finger and your thumb. Use gentle pressure to rub your lenses. Rinse your glasses off. Then, dry your lenses with a microfiber cloth. [1] X Research source Dish soap loosens up any buildup, like dust or sweat, that might coat your lenses. A microfiber cloth won’t get lint on your glasses or smudge them. When you use it to dry your glasses, it’ll be a lot easier to see the scratches on your lenses."

      "content": "Use this household remedy to polish scratches off your glasses. Combine 1-2 tbsp (15-30 g) of baking soda and 1 tbsp (15 mL) of water. Stir with a spoon until you create a thick paste that’s the consistency of glue. Dip a clean microfiber cloth into the paste, then rub the scratches in your lenses in a circular motion. Buff your lenses for 10-30 seconds. Rinse off your lenses. Use a microfiber cloth to dry your lenses and wipe away any remaining paste. Baking soda has a low abrasiveness—or roughness—rating, so it can remove scratches without damaging your lenses."

      "content": "Rub out scratches with a non-abrasive, non-gel brand of toothpaste. Squeeze one dab of toothpaste onto each of your lenses. Use your finger to rub the toothpaste into any scratches on your lenses for about 10 seconds. Rinse your lenses and wipe off the toothpaste with a clean microfiber cloth. Use white or clear toothpaste that won’t stain your lenses. Steer clear of any advanced formulas that whiten or remove plaque from teeth as these abrasive varieties can create even more scratches."

      "content": "Use car wax to fill in the scratches on your lenses. Dampen a clean microfiber cloth with car wax and rub your lenses in a circular motion. Check and make sure the car wax fills all the scratches on your lenses. Use a fresh microfiber cloth to buff your glasses. If you still see scratches, repeat this process multiple times until your lenses are clear. Car wax usually comes in either spray bottles or tubs, but either variety will work. The wax fills in the scratches and wears off over time, but you can reapply it to maintain the quality of your lenses."

      "title": "Buff away scratches in your lenses with a non-abrasive metal polish.",
      "content": "Buff away scratches in your lenses with a non-abrasive metal polish. Dip a clean microfiber cloth in a non-abrasive metal polish and use it to rub your lenses in a circular motion. Continue to buff your lenses until the scratches fade away. To remove the metal polish from your lenses, sprinkle rubbing alcohol onto them and wipe them down with a cotton ball. When you use metal polish, you strip off the scratched-up coating on plastic lenses. Metal polish won’t work on glass lenses because they don’t have the same coating as plastic lenses. Avoid using metal polish on your prescription glasses so you can keep the UV coating on them."

      "content": "Use etching cream to remove the scratched-up coating on plastic lenses. Scoop up etching cream from the bottle with a cotton ball. Apply etching cream evenly across your lenses. If you get any etching cream on the frames, use a cotton swab to wipe it off. Wait for 5 minutes, then rub off the etching cream with a clean cotton ball. [2] X Research source Use etching cream only for your plastic lenses. If you put etching cream on glass lenses, you’ll cause them to “frost,” or permanently fog over and crack.

When you store your glasses in a case, your lenses won’t rub up against hard objects or rough surfaces and you won’t crack your glasses if you drop them. While you’re wearing your glasses, you can wear an “eyewear retainer,” a band that keeps your glasses on your face so they don’t fall off and get scratched.
