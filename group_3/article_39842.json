      "content": "Replace heavy bedding with lighter bedding. Remove thick mattress protectors or pads, which retain heat, and any heavy blankets or duvets. Use lighter bedding like cotton sheets and lightweight cotton weave blankets on your bed. [3] X Research source Straw or bamboo mats are also great for a cool night’s sleep. They do not retain body heat and will not warm you up. You can create a bamboo mat bed on the floor of your bedroom for an alternative spot to your regular bed."

      "content": "Put your bedding in the freezer. Stick your pillow cases, bed sheets and blankets in the freezer 30 minutes before you plan to go to bed. Once you place the bedding on your bed, they should stay cool enough for 30 to 40 minutes, just enough time to fall asleep . Avoid getting your bedding wet or sleeping on or in wet sheets or clothing. Don’t dip your socks in cold water and wear them to bed, or wear a wet t-shirt to bed. Bringing anything wet into the room, or wearing anything wet, will only trap dense humidity in your room and cause discomfort. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Open your windows or use an air conditioner.",
      "content": "Open your windows or use an air conditioner . An hour before bedtime, open the windows in the room to increase air circulation and cool down the room. However, you should close the windows before you fall asleep to avoid heating up the room with air during the night. While you sleep, your body temperature dips to its lowest point at around 3 am. At 3 am, the temperature outside is also extremely low. If you are asleep with the windows open, the muscles around your neck and head can tense up involuntarily due to the sudden temperature drop and you can be woken up. Keep the windows closed and the blinds or shades drawn during the day to avoid heating up the room."

Though you may be tempted to strip down and go naked to stay cool, sleeping naked can make you feel hotter as it does not allow moisture to evaporate between your body and the sleeping surface. Go for cotton sleepwear, and avoid synthetic fabrics like nylon or viscose, as they are not breathable and can make you feel hotter. [5] X Research source"

But avoid going to sleep with a wet face or arms. Once you have wiped your body, dry yourself off with a dry towel before you go to sleep. You can also buy special towels that are made of hyper-evaporative material that retains water, but stays dry to the touch. They will cool you down without getting your skin wet."

Place a container under the towel to catch the melting ice water."

      "content": "Place an ice pack on your neck or forehead. You can buy cold packs in most grocery stores. Slip a cold pack under your neck, on your forehead, or under your arms, by your armpits. Cooling down the back of your neck, your forehead, and under your arms helps cool the rest of your body down as well. You can also make your own cold pack at home. Place three to four tablespoons of dish soap in a resealable Ziploc bag. Place it in the freezer. The soap will not harden, and it will hold the cold temperature longer than ice and/or the blue ice packs. Once you are ready to use it, place in a pillowcase or fold it in a towel and apply it to your neck or arms. Because the pack is not solid, it is versatile and comfortable on most areas of your body. You can also make a rice sock . Place it in the freezer and leave it there for at least two hours. When you turn in, bring the bag with you to use as a cool compress. Try placing it under your pillow so it's nice and cool when you flip it over."
