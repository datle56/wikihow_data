      "title": "Listen to your teacher.",
      "content": "Listen to your teacher. When the fire alarm goes off, get quiet and listen up. Your teacher will remind you of what to do. Don't interrupt your teacher or talk to students next to you. There may also be an announcement on the loudspeaker, so listen up for that as well."

      "title": "Exit the building on your own if you are not with your class.",
      "content": "Exit the building on your own if you are not with your class. The fire alarm might go off when you're in the bathroom or hallway. If the fire alarm goes off and you're not in your classroom, walk out of the building and go to the assembly point. Ask the nearest teacher or staff member what to do next. [1] X Research source If you see a class exiting, join them. Tell the teacher you are from another class. If a teacher or staff member at your school gives you directions while you're on your way to the assembly point, follow them."

    {
      "title": "Line up at the door as directed by your teacher.",
      "content": "Line up at the door as directed by your teacher. Form a single file line and keep directly behind the person in front of you. If you are someone's helper, line up with them."

      "title": "Leave your things.",
      "content": "Leave your things. When there's a fire alarm, it's important to react immediately! Don't worry about the project you are working on or the game you are playing. Put your things down. [2] X Research source Your safety is more important than your things. Any stuff you bring with you will slow you down."
    },
    {
      "title": "Walk outside quietly.",
      "content": "Walk outside quietly. Stay in your line as you leave the building. Follow your teacher to the nearest exit. While in line, stay quiet and keep your hands to yourself. Avoid pushing your classmates or any other students. Walk normally, and never run. Stay in line so your teacher can keep track of you."
    },
    {
      "title": "Stay at the assembly point.",
      "content": "Stay at the assembly point. Once your class has walked to the assembly point, your teacher will probably call roll. Listen for your name and respond when you are called. If the building is on fire and there is a danger of explosion, face away from the building. Do not re-enter the building unless your teacher directs you to."
    },
    {
      "title": "Stop, drop, and roll.",
      "content": "Stop, drop, and roll. If your clothes catch on fire, put the fire out by stopping where you are, dropping on the ground, and rolling. Rolling will smother the flames against the ground. [3] X Research source Keep rolling until the flames are gone."

    {
      "title": "Get low to avoid smoke.",
      "content": "Get low to avoid smoke. Breathing smoke can hurt you and make you pass out. Smoke rises, so you can avoid it if you get under it. If you see smoke, crawl to stay below it. [4] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Breathe through a cloth.",
      "content": "Breathe through a cloth. If it is smokey, put cloth over your mouth and breathe through that. Pull your shirt up over your mouth, for instance. Put a little water on the cloth first if you can. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Yell for help.",
      "content": "Yell for help. If you're alone and there's a fire, yell for help. If you are in your room and there's a fire in your house, open your window and yell for help. Yell until you have attracted someone's attention. Never hide when there's a fire. The firefighters need to be able to find you."

      "title": "Alert others if you see fire.",
      "content": "Alert others if you see fire. If you are at school and you see a fire, get away from the fire immediately. Run and tell an adult about the fire. Even if you or someone else started the fire, don't worry about getting in trouble. It's more important that nobody gets hurt. [6] X Research source Pull the alarm. Use your phone to call an emergency number once you are out of the building. Call 911 if you are in the US, Canada, Mexico, or another country that uses 911 as an emergency number. If you are in Europe, call 112.
