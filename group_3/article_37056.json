      "content": "Determine the type of socket switch you need and purchase one from a hardware store. Your new switch can be whatever type you prefer, regardless of the existing switch. For instance, if your lamp has a pull chain but you want to install a 3-way turn knob, all you have to do is buy a 3-way turn switch and a light bulb with 2 brightness levels . [1] X Research source You can even replace a socket switch with a cord switch. Just purchase a new socket assembly without a switch and follow the instructions below for replacing a cord switch . You can buy a new socket switch from most hardware stores, and they usually cost around $2-$5 USD."

      "content": "Unplug the lamp before you begin repairs. When working with wires, master electrician Daniel Stoescu says to always turn the power off (in this case, by unplugging the lamp) so you don’t get shocked or electrocuted. Double-check to be sure that the lamp is unplugged before you start to take it apart. Make sure your work area is well-lit so you’re still able to see while you replace your lamp switch. Let the bulb and socket cool off before you start working so you don’t burn yourself."

On most lamps, you can squeeze the socket shell and pull upwards to remove it. [2] X Research source If the socket shell is hard to remove, use a screwdriver to pry it loose. Be careful not to cut yourself on any sharp edges while you remove the socket shell."

      "content": "Locate the wires attached to the socket shell. There should be 2 wires attached to the switch. 1 is hot and the other is neutral. The hot wire is usually attached to a brass screw, and the neutral wire is usually attached to a silver screw. [3] X Research source The neutral wire is usually marked. It may be a different color, or the insulation may be printed, stamped, or have indentations. Note this now so you know which wire is neutral when you hook up your new switch. If you can’t identify the neutral wire, look at the plug. The neutral wire is attached to the wider plug blade on a polarized plug. If your plug blades are the same size, you should replace the plug while you’re replacing the socket. [4] X Research source"

If they’re are connected with the brass and silver screws, remove them with your hands. If they’re connected to the body itself, remove them with your hands or cut them as close to the switch if they’re tightly secured.

Use wire cutters to make a notch in the insulation around the wires, then clamp down on the insulation with the strippers and carefully pull the insulation away. [6] X Research source If you see any strands of wire when you pull away the insulation, it means you cut too deep. Cut off that section and start again."

Use your fingers to wrap each wire tightly around the corresponding screw (the neutral wire to the silver screw and the hot wire to the brass screw). Although sockets are slightly different depending on the manufacturer, the wires should thread easily through the socket. [7] X Research source Make sure the socket is right-side-up and look for wire channels to help you know where to guide the wire. Use pliers to curl the wires if you’re unable to properly move them with your fingers."

If the lamp doesn't come on, check the connection in your switch and try again. If this doesn't help, you may need to replace the plug. [9] X Research source Once you replace your switch and bulb, regularly clean your socket switch and periodically check it for signs of wear and tear, as dust and debris tend to build up over time. Use a bulb with the correct wattage. Check the wattage by consulting your instruction manual or checking the label on the inside of the lamp. When you use the wrong wattage for your lamp, it can lead to overheating. When you’re storing bulbs, make sure they’re in a cool, dry place so they don’t accumulate moisture or anything else that can damage the socket switch."

It’s typically located on the cord’s insulation. The printing is small, so you might have to look carefully. Once you’ve determined the size switch you need, head to a hardware store near you or hop online and order a new cord switch. [10] X Research source The difference between SPT-1 and SPT-2 involves the thickness of the lamp cord. Pick the cord switch that best fits your needs, just make sure it works with the lamp that you currently have."

Licensed electrical contractor Martin Hennum says you may be able to open the casing of the existing switch and remove the wires without cutting them, but if not, use wire cutters to cut as close to the switch as you can. Hennum says to avoid cutting the neutral wire. If you have to cut it to remove the old switch, strip the insulation and connect the cut ends of the neutral wire. If you like, add a plastic connector to protect the wire at the location where you want your new switch to be. If you’re adding a cord switch when there wasn’t one before, use a small knife to carefully split the cord where you want your new switch to go, then cut through the hot wire. If your switch requires you to attach the neutral wire, cut through that too."
