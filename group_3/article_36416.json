      "content": "Buy a color removing product. Go to a local beauty supply store or pharmacy and purchase a color remover . Color removers work by infiltrating your cuticles (the layer of your hair that protects its shine) and breaking down the molecules in your hair dye so they're easier to wash out. [1] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Remember that hair color remover can only strip colors that are darker than your natural shade. If you bleached or chemically lightened your hair, there are no dye molecules that the hair color remover can break down. If you have long hair, you might need to buy 2 packages. Color removers are aggressive and work especially well removing blonde and purple hair dyes from lighter hair."

Open the color remover package and take out the 2 bottles of liquid that are inside. 1 bottle will be a color remover and the other bottle will be an activator. Pour the activating agent from the into the bottle with the color remover. Then, seal it. Shake the bottle for 30 seconds so the mixture is combined. [2] X Research source If you have tightly-curled hair, talk to a professional hairstylist before using any over-the-counter color removers. Because your hair is dry and finely-textured, their harsh chemicals may cause damage to your roots and scalp if you’re not careful. Always read the manufacturer's instructions before beginning to use the color-removing product. Some packages may recommend that you pour both of the bottles into a non-metallic bowl and stir until the liquids are combined."

      "content": "Massage the liquid through your hair. Pour the thin liquid onto your hair and carefully rub it down to your roots so the strands in each section are totally saturated. Since the liquid is very thin, you'll have to work quickly so it doesn't run through your fingers. If you have thick or knotty hair, brush your hair out first so the liquid doesn’t get tangled. If you have long hair, divide your hair into 3 to 5 sections using clips . Massage each section, 1 at a time. If you'd like more control in applying the liquid, pour it into a bowl and dip a tint brush into it. Brush the liquid onto strands of your hair until it's coated."

Once you’ve left the product in your hair for the recommended time, rinse your hair with warm water and massage shampoo through each coated section. Rinse out the shampoo. Then, massage more shampoo back into your hair. Continue to rinse and shampoo for 20 full minutes. You'll probably wash your hair at least 4 times during this process, but it’s best to be thorough, otherwise your hair can become damaged, dry, or brittle from any leftover color-stripping residue. Not only does shampooing cleanse, moisturize, and protect your hair from the oxidizing agents in color remover, rising with shampoo can strip down the molecules in your hair dye even further. [4] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Choose a shampoo designed for your hair type and avoid using color-enhancing or protecting shampoos. For example, if you have fine, dry, brittle hair, choose a moisturizing shampoo . If you have thick, oily or greasy hair, choose a paraben or sulfate-free shampoo ."

      "content": "Go to a professional if you want them to adjust your remaining color. If you’re still unsatisfied after using a hair color remover, go to a salon and ask them to help you with re-coloring. Talk to a hair stylist about blending and offsetting until you get the hair color you're looking for. Also ask which toners might be right for recoloring your hair. If you used a dark dye color and you have fair hair, it will likely take a few uses of toner to get your hair back to its original shade. To save a little money, go to a beauty school and ask about their color correcting services. Their options will likely be cheaper, because their stylists are still in training."

Condition your hair several times to successfully remove all of the dye that's in your hair. Anti-dandruff shampoos can damage your hair if you don't condition after using them. Consider adding about ¼ cup of honey and a dash of ground cinnamon when you condition. This will expedite the hair-lightening process."

Squeeze enough lemon juice onto your hair to completely soak it. Then, leave the juice in for 1 hour before you scrub it out with hot water and [ moisturizing conditioner. [10] X Research source For a gentler hair-stripping treatment, use white or apple cider vinegar instead of lemon juice to prevent altering the pH balance of your scalp. While lemon juice’s antioxidants are nourishing for most hair types, those with sensitive skin may find some redness afterward. You’ll probably have to do this several times to notice a major difference in the color of your hair. You may need to condition your hair a few times after each lemon juice soak, as lemon juice’s high acidity can dry your hair out.
