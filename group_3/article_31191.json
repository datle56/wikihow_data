      "content": "Use a rotary-action lawn mower. You can use any kind of rotary-action garden lawn mower to mulch leaves. Two types of lawnmower that are work particularly well for this task are high power mulching lawnmowers and side-discharge lawn mower. If you want to leave the leaf mulch on the lawn to improve your grass, take the grass catcher or bag off the lawn mower, being very careful of the blade. However, if you want to use the mulch elsewhere, you may want to leave the grass catcher attached to the mower, as this saves you the effort of raking up the mulch afterwards."

      "content": "Spread the leaves over your lawn using a rake. If you plan to leave the mulch on the lawn, distribute the leaves over the whole area. Use a rake to spread them out over the entire surface of the lawn. If you're lucky, the trees may have already done this for you! If you plan to remove the leaf mold for use elsewhere, consider raking the leaves up into a smaller area. That way, after mowing you will have less area to cover when gathering the leaf mold. Alternately, you can leave the grass catcher on the lawn mower and scoop the leaf mold out of there. You may need to keep emptying this, depending on how much leaf litter you have."

If you plan on leaving the leaf mulch on the lawn a one inch layer is ideal, as it will wash down with the rain and decompose over time. If the mulch is still too thick on your lawn, try reattaching your grass catcher or bag and passing over it again – this will gather up some of the mulch. Alternately, you can rake some of it up and use it elsewhere."

      "content": "Use leaf mulch as a lawn improver. If you leave the mulch leaves on your lawn after mowing, you'll be doing it a favor. It will improve the soil and add some nutrients. Although fallen leaves will mulch the lawn naturally, mulching the with the mower helps them to break down (decompose) faster, especially if they are mixed in with grass clippings. This will happen naturally if you use a mower to make the mulch. Fall is a good time to do this, as the leaf mulch will also protect the grass roots over winter."

      "content": "Use leaf mulch elsewhere in your garden. Leaf mold also makes a great mulch for garden plants. Apply it under plants, shrubs and hedges in a layer 3 to 4 inches (7.6 to 10.2 cm) thick. You may need to water the plants first if the weather has been dry recently. If you are replacing a mulch layer from the previous year, remove any old mulch before you apply a fresh layer. Leaf mulch is also good for adding to the compost heap."
