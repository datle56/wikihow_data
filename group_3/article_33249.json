      "content": "Gather initial resources. Minecraft is largely about gathering and using the resources from the world around you. When starting out in Minecraft, you'll immediately need to gather the following: Dirt - Perhaps the most common block in the game. Dirt is relatively useless later in the game, but can be used to create an effective temporary shelter early in the game. The dirt is very useful as it can also help when you get caught in a deep hole, which you can easily arrange one by one to create a dirt stair. Wood blocks - Hitting trees will yield wood blocks. Wood is necessary for crafting everything from weapon and tool handles to torches and crafting resources. Gravel and Sand - Both of these resources are similar to dirt, and can be used as floor or wall material. Gravel and sand both fall when no block is placed directly below them. Wool - You can get wool by killing sheep. Wool (three pieces of the same color) and any type of wooden planks is necessary when creating a bed, which is an essential piece of equipment if you want to avoid frustration early on in Minecraft."

This will ensure that you have a place to hide when the world's night cycle begins. When making a house, the easiest way to make one (Also suggested by Mojang) is to find a hill and mine out a cave in the hill and put doors so mobs can't get into the house. To make doors, arrange 2 columns of wooden planks on the left of your crafting table. You'll want to use dirt for your house because wood is much more useful for crafting tools. Remember to leave at least one block-sized hole somewhere in the house for telling when it is day so you can get out at the crack of dawn to have extra time to collect resources."

Beds serve two purposes: they allow you to bypass the dangerous night cycle by sleeping through it, and they reset your spawn point to the last bed in which you rested. This means that should you die, you won't respawn at the beginning of the world; instead, you'll spawn next to your bed. Creating a bed as soon as possible is incredibly important, especially if you built your shelter relatively far away from where you started your game."

      "content": "Sleep in your bed as soon as night falls. As previously mentioned, this will allow you to skip the night cycle, which is when Minecraft's monsters (referred to as \"mobs\" in-game) appear. If you didn't have the chance to create a bed before nightfall, sit tight in your shelter until the sun comes back up."

      "content": "Craft some tools . Tools are the backbone of any successful Minecraft playthrough, as they allow you to obtain and craft objectively superior weapons, tools, and armor later in the game. You'll want to start out with the following tools: Pickaxe - Used for mining stone. You'll start by crafting a wood pickaxe, but you can craft a stone pickaxe by using the wood pickaxe to mine three blocks of stone. Sword - Used for defending yourself against mobs. Any sword—even a wooden one—is significantly better than using your fists. Axe - Used for quickly chopping wood. While you don't need an axe to chop wood, having one will significantly speed up the process. Shovel - Used for quickly gathering dirt, gravel, and sand. You don't need a shovel to gather these resources, but having a shovel will speed up the process."

While you may be tempted to run away from every animal and monster that you see, most mobs won't attack you unless you attack first: Peaceful - These mobs will never attack you, though they will flee if you attack them. Examples include most livestock (pigs, cows, sheep, etc.). Neutral - These mobs will not attack you unless you attack first. Examples include Endermen and Spiders (day only). Hostile - These mobs will always attack on sight. Examples include Zombies, Skeletons, and Spiders (night only)."

      "title": "Place plenty of torches around your dwelling.",
      "content": "Place plenty of torches around your dwelling. In addition to brightening up the area, torches raise the ambient light level; this prevents hostile mobs (e.g., Creepers, Zombies, Skeletons, etc.) from spawning near your house, which affords you some security at night. You'll need to place a lot of torches in order to fully prevent mobs from spawning near your house. A safe bet is to place a solid ring of torches around your house."

      "title": "Build a furnace",
      "content": "Build a furnace . Among other things, furnaces can be used to cook food and smelt iron ore into iron ingots. Since food is essential to survival and iron is arguably the best common resource you'll be able to find for most of Minecraft, a furnace will be invaluable. You can use your furnace by placing a furnace-compatible resource (e.g., food or ore) in the top section of the furnace and then placing fuel (e.g., coal, wood, lava, etc.) in the bottom section."

Things like cobblestone, coal, iron, and wood are all essential to your prolonged survival in Minecraft, so gather as much as you can. If you find a particularly resource-rich location (e.g., a cave), mark the path to it with torches or an expendable block trail. You can create chests to store your gathered resources so that you don't have to carry them with you the next time that you go exploring."

While your initial temporary dwelling is most likely crude and constructed of mismatched material, you can create a well-fortified house once you have enough material. Resources such as stone (particularly granite) and iron are more explosive-proof than are dirt and wood. This is helpful when attempting to minimize Creeper damage."

If you'd rather use your old house as storage and fortify your new house independently, doing so is safer than attempting to move. Only move your house's contents during the day. Do not break a chest while items are still in it—move the items from the chest into your inventory, then break the chest to pick it up."

    {
      "title": "Find food.",
      "content": "Find food. You can obtain food by killing animals and picking up the meat that they drop (e.g., picking up raw pork from pigs). Food can be consumed to heal your character and restore the \"Hunger\" meter, which depletes over time. You can cook food by placing it in a furnace that has fuel in it. You can consume food by placing it in your equip bar, selecting it, and pressing the \"Mine\" button (or tapping and holding the screen in Minecraft PE)."
    },
    {
      "title": "Avoid fighting mobs if possible.",
      "content": "Avoid fighting mobs if possible. Minecraft is not a combat-centric game; while you have the means to craft items with which you can defend yourself, actively going out and attempting to kill mobs is more likely to result in your death than in you surviving the night. While there will always be exceptions to this rule (e.g., if you have to kill a spider for some string), running away from conflict is always better than entertaining it in Minecraft. If you must fight mobs, you'll want to use a sword or an axe to do so; other tools are more effective than using your bare fists, however. Creepers (the green exploding monsters) are best left alone. If one begins pursuing you, hit it once and then retreat until it explodes. Endermen (the tall black figures) will not attack you if you avoid looking at them or hitting them. If provoked, Endermen will prove incredibly tough to kill with any equipment. If you have a bow and some arrows, you can usually attack enemies while backpedaling. Keep in mind that some mobs (e.g., Skeletons) also have bows and arrows."
