Qualified medical professionals include a physician licensed to practice medicine in Colorado or a neighboring state; a commissioned medical officer of the U.S. Armed Forces, Public Health Service, or Veterans Administration; and advance practice nurses or physician's assistants. Chiropractors or physical therapists also can provide verification, but only for temporary disability to get a temporary 90-day placard."

      "title": "Meet an impairment classification.",
      "content": "Meet an impairment classification. Your doctor must classify your impairment as permanent, extended, temporary, or short-term. How your impairment is classified determines what parking permit options you have. You are permanently disabled if, given the current state of medicine, your doctor does not expect your condition to improve in your lifetime. You have an extended disability if your doctor does not expect your condition to change within 30 months of the day your disabled parking permit is issued. Temporary conditions are those expected to last less than 30 months from the day you are issued a disabled parking permit, while short-term conditions are expected to last 90 days or less. If your impairment is classified as short-term, you are only eligible for a temporary 90-day placard."

You also need to choose which option you want for your disabled parking permits. If you have permanent, extended, or temporary disability and you own or co-own a vehicle, you can choose one license plate, two license plates, one plate and one placard, one placard, or two placards. If you don't have a vehicle, you can choose one or two placards. If you have a short-term impairment, you only qualify for a temporary placard. This placard is valid for 90 days and can be moved from one vehicle to another."

If you are planning on getting one or more disabled license plates for your vehicle, you must show the title or registration for any vehicle you want to tag. If you want a set of plates, you must be the registered owner or co-owner of the vehicle. The registration receipt will identify you as the owner authorized to use the plates or placard. While there is no fee for disabled placards, if you get disabled plates you will pay the same fees and taxes as are assessed for any regular set of plates and registration in Colorado. The only exception is a set of disabled veteran plates, for which there is no fee. If you are applying for disabled veteran license plates, you also must bring a written statement from the Veteran's Administration or a branch of the armed forces stating that you have a qualifying disability that is connected to your military service."

If you want to park in disabled parking, you must display your plates or placard according to Colorado state law, or risk getting your vehicle towed. Placards must be hanging from the rear view mirror at all times if you're parked in disabled parking. You can transfer it to any vehicle in which you are either the passenger or the driver, but you must carry the placard registration receipt at all times. If you co-own the vehicle, only you can use the disabled parking plates. If both you and the other owner are eligible for disability privileges, the other owner must apply separately to exercise those privileges. The plates are issued to the individual, not to the vehicle."

If you have a red temporary placard, you may renew it once by having a medical professional verify your disability at the expiration of the initial 90-day period."
