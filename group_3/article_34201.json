      "title": "Use purple shampoo.",
      "content": "Use purple shampoo. [2] X Expert Source Karen Leight Professional Hair Stylist Expert Interview. 13 November 2020. A number of purple shampoos--literally, the shampoo is purple--are available at salons and drugstores, and they work to counteract brassiness in blonde hair. [3] X Research source ”Brassiness” is when blonde hair takes on an unflattering yellow or orange tone. It results when the blue molecules in hair begin to fade and leave the yellow and orange molecules to shine through more strongly. Purple shampoos work by restoring blue tones to the hair, helping to prevent brassiness."

      "content": "Install a shower head filter. The minerals in tap water can contribute to changing blonde’s natural tone into a brassier color (from iron deposits) or into a greenish color (from the chlorine in the water). [4] X Research source Installing a filter on your shower head will help prevent those color-changing minerals from being absorbed into your hair and will help keep your hair its natural shade."

      "title": "Use a toner.",
      "content": "Use a toner. [5] X Expert Source Karen Leight Professional Hair Stylist Expert Interview. 13 November 2020. If your hair is taking on a brassy tone, make an appointment at the hair salon to have toner applied or buy toner at a drugstore and apply it yourself. [6] X Research source Toner increases the blue and purple tones in your hair and mutes the orange and yellow ones, counteracting brassiness. You can typically expect to pay about $40 or more for a toning treatment at a salon. A drugstore toner will typically cost around $10, but may not be as effective as a salon treatment."

      "title": "Get hair wet before going in the pool.",
      "content": "Get hair wet before going in the pool. Spraying your hair down with tap or filtered water before going in the pool will help prevent it from soaking up chlorine in the pool water. Be sure the water you’re spraying your hair with isn’t already highly chlorinated, or it will defeat the purpose."

      "title": "Use an acidic hair rinse to counteract green tones.",
      "content": "Use an acidic hair rinse to counteract green tones. If your hair begins to take on a greenish cast after swimming in a pool or because your shower water contains higher levels of copper or chlorine, you can help tone down the green by using an acidic hair rinse. An acidic hair rinse will remove the buildup left behind by styling products and mineral deposits that can cause changes in your hair color. Mix 1/2 cup (for shorter hair) to 1 cup (for longer hair) of apple cider vinegar with 16 ounces of water. After shampooing, rinse your hair with the vinegar mixture and let it sit for about 5 minutes. Rinse your hair again and style as usual. Dissolve 6-8 aspirin tablets in a glass of warm water and rinse your hair with the solution. Let it sit for 10-15 minutes, then rinse out the solution."

      "content": "Apply lemon juice and sit in the sun. To keep your hair from darkening, mix equal parts pure lemon juice and water or olive oil and spray it into your hair. [7] X Research source Diluting the juice with water or olive oil will help keep hair from drying out, though it may also cause the juice to take longer to work. Sit outside in the sun for about an hour and the lemon will help lighten your hair naturally. Follow the lemon with a conditioning treatment, as lemon juice can be drying to your hair. [8] X Research source Repeat several times a week until your hair reaches the desired shade."

      "title": "Apply hydrogen peroxide and sit in the sun.",
      "content": "Apply hydrogen peroxide and sit in the sun. Like lemon juice, hydrogen peroxide can help lighten hair, particularly when exposed to the sun. Fill a spray bottle with hydrogen peroxide. Spray the peroxide through your hair. Go outside and let your hair dry in the sun. Apply a conditioning treatment afterward, as hydrogen peroxide can be drying to hair. Repeat weekly until you reach your desired shade."

      "title": "Use a camomile tea rinse.",
      "content": "Use a camomile tea rinse. Camomile tea--the same stuff you drink--will give a warm golden glow to your hair when you use it as a rinse. [9] X Research source Boil about 16 ounces of water and add about 5 camomile tea bags. Steep the tea bags for 15-20 minutes. Allow the tea to cool. After shampooing and conditioning your hair, pour the tea through your hair, or, alternatively, fill a spray bottle with the tea and spray through your hair. Leave the tea rinse in and let your hair air dry. Repeat each day until your hair is the desired shade."

    {
      "title": "Use a camomile tea mask.",
      "content": "Use a camomile tea mask. If you prefer a slightly more intensive treatment, you can use a camomile mask on your hair rather than a rinse. [10] X Research source Boil about 1 cup of water and add about 4 camomile tea bags. Steep the tea bags for 15-20 minutes. Allow the tea to cool. Mix about 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of plain natural yogurt into the tea (2 tablespoons is best for medium-length hair; if your hair is shorter, use less; if your hair is longer, use more). Apply the mask and cover your hair with a shower cap, saran wrap, or, if you have neither of those, a towel. Leave the mask on for an hour, then shampoo and condition as usual. Repeat once or twice a week until your hair reaches the desired shade."

      "content": "Add cinnamon to your conditioner. Cinnamon can naturally lighten your hair without any damaging effects. Grind up 3 tablespoons of cinnamon. Freshly ground cinnamon is optimal to use, but if you can’t grind your own, you can use commercially ground cinnamon. Mix the cinnamon with a few tablespoons of conditioner. Mix in the cinnamon thoroughly. Spread the mix throughout your hair. Cover your hair with a shower cap, saran wrap, or, if you have neither of those, a towel. Leave on for four hours (or overnight). Shampoo and condition the following day like normal. Repeat several times a week until you achieve the desired shade."

      "content": "Add honey to your conditioner. Honey can naturally lighten your hair without damaging it, and, as a bonus, honey’s beneficial to both your hair and scalp. Honey, however, lightens hair more slowly than many other methods. Combine 1/3 cup honey with 1/4 cup conditioner. Mix well. Apply the mixture through your hair. Cover your hair with a shower cap, saran wrap, of, if you have neither, a towel. Leave on for four hours or overnight. Shampoo and condition the following day like normal. Repeat to achieve desired shade."
