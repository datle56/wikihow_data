      "content": "Match my freak refers to someone sharing your “weird” side. On TikTok and other social media sites, many users have been posting videos about wanting someone to “match their freak,” or be the same type of weird as them. This trend often refers to habits, hobbies, and interests that may seem odd to others. When someone matches your freak, it means they share these interests with you and aren’t afraid or embarrassed to enjoy them. [1] X Research source For example, “When’s somebody gonna match my freak and learn every fact about the sinking of the Titanic?” Or, “I need someone to match my freak and talk to themselves out loud when they’re alone.” Many people also use the phrase sarcastically to show how “normal” or “boring” their interests are. For example, “I need someone to match my freak (order pizza and binge-watch Netflix all night).”"

      "content": "The phrase originally referred to sexual interests and desires. “Match my freak” was originally a line in the song “Nasty” by Tinashe , in which the singer says, “Is somebody gonna match my freak? / Is somebody gonna match my nasty? / I got stamina, they say I’m an athlete.” This alludes to her sexual stamina, as she’s looking for someone who can match her “freak” in bed. In most cases, however, the phrase isn’t used sexually on social media and has instead become somewhat of a meme. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Talk about a partner who is the same kind of weird as you. In most cases, the TikTok “match my freak” trend refers to having or wanting a partner who has the same “weird” habits, interests, and hobbies as you. TikTok users frequently post about how they and their partner are extremely compatible and are practically the same person. Here are some examples: [3] X Research source “I knew he matched my freak when he agreed to play mermaids with me in the pool.” “My partner and I definitely match each other’s freak because we get heated when we play Mario Kart.” “When will I find someone who will match my freak and pretend to have British accents when we go out in public?” Matching each other’s freak doesn’t always have to apply to romantic partners. It can apply to platonic relationships, too!"

      "content": "Poke fun at your “boring” hobbies and interests. Many TikTok creators use the “match my freak” trend as a tongue-in-cheek way to describe how they’re not a freak. Because the original meaning of the phrase is sexual, users often use it in the complete opposite way by talking about how they’re an average person who likes doing things like watching Netflix and eating snacks in bed. Here are some examples: “Is somebody gonna match my freak (lie in bed all day binge-watching New Girl ?)” “When is somebody gonna match my freak and go book shopping at Barnes and Noble and then pick up a little treat on the way home?” “Need somebody to match my freak—ordering a Caesar salad, fries, and a diet coke anytime I go out to eat.”"

These videos are typically accompanied by old photos that prove the user actually did the things they’re talking about. [13] X Research source For example, post a video with the “I remember when I lost my mind” sound that reveals you once sang and recorded a cover of a One Direction song to send to your crush.

Users posted videos showing places and things that “raised” them, or strongly impacted their childhood or personal development. [14] X Research source For example, you might post a picture of the cast of Glee captioned with the lyrics, indicating that the show played a large role in your development. Or, post an image of the game The Sims to indicate how much time you spent playing it growing up.

      "content": "Looking for a man in finance “Looking for a Man in Finance” or “Man in Finance” is a satirical song written by TikTok user Megan Boni (@girl_on_couch) that went viral on TikTok in spring 2024. Boni said the song was intended to poke fun at women who complained about being single but had extremely high expectations when it comes to partners. Many TikTok users began posting their own videos with the song in the background that stated their own expectations for a partner. [15] X Research source For example, the viral lyrics of the song are “I’m looking for a man in finance, trust fund, 6’5”, blue eyes.” You might post your own video but caption it as “I’m looking for a man with tattoos, piercings, 6’5, green eyes.” Alternatively, post images of a fictional character or celebrity who fits the “Man in Finance” description. For example, a popular character for this trend is Nate Archibald from Gossip Girl ."
