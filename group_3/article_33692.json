      "content": "Financial Success In a lot of Eastern folklore (from Chinese to Middle Eastern mythology), coming across the poop of a dog, bird, pig, or any non-human animal is an omen for prosperity. [1] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Some believe this is because poop is a fertilizer, so more poop means better yields and harvests. Others see it as these animals offering a gift. Regardless, if you dream of poop, there’s a chance the spirit world is telling you you’re about to stumble into some money. Similarly, some cultures see poop as a warning to be careful with your money. New finances are a lot of responsibility, so don’t make any rash decisions and spend your money wisely."

      "title": "Shame",
      "content": "Shame Despite poop being a natural bodily function, defecating is still seen by most of the world as a gross or obscene activity. If you dream of poop, your subconscious may be telling you that you’ve internalized this obscenity. You’re ashamed of something you’ve done in the past and dung is how this shame manifests. In addition, we’re at our most vulnerable when we’re using the bathroom, so this may be your mind telling you that you secretly feel exposed. Shame is a particularly common theme for poop dreams where you have to go but can’t find a bathroom. [2] X Research source But remember: shame is a lot like poop. Everybody experiences it and it’s unhealthy to bottle it in. Practice self-compassion to let that stuff go (literally and figuratively) .

      "content": "Spiritual Clarity & Cleansing Defecating is a form of release. It quite literally cleans your body of toxins. [4] X Trustworthy Source Johns Hopkins Medicine Official resource database of the world-leading Johns Hopkins Hospital Go to source If you see poop or experience yourself pooping in a dream, it means your body has expelled/is expelling the toxic thoughts and feelings that you’ve been keeping bottled in. Similarly, if you dream of constipation, it’s a sign your body is still carrying negative energy. In addition, poop can be a symbol of past mistakes. Since it’s something that needs cleaning up, you may subconsciously realize an error you made that also needs to be disposed of. [5] X Research source In waking life, many people often have issues with constipation, hemorrhoids, and even colon cancer from \"holding onto the past\" or being \"unable to release the past.\" This is a VERY common spiritual condition that manifests into physical issues. Likewise, this theme frequently shows up in our dreams as similar issues regarding the release of the bowels, because this is the part of the body that releases what we no longer need or want in life."

      "content": "Dreaming of cleaning poop symbolizes inner strength. While pooping is natural, properly cleaning it can be unpleasant.

      "content": "If your poop is overflowing, it's a sign of overwhelming opportunities. The toilet in your dream may symbolize your mind, wallet, or spirits, overflowing with ideas, income, or emotions. While this is typically a good sign, it can also mean you have more thoughts or prospects than you know what to do with. Overflowing poop means you’re likely to encounter a surge of creativity or good fortune ; use your time wisely and don’t let them overwhelm you. Some cultures also see an overflowing poop dream as a sign to be cautious and not embarrass yourself during social gatherings (parties, business meetings, etc). [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Poop floating in water can represent emotional blockage. In astrology, tarot, and other forms of spirituality, water is often the element of emotions and feelings. [8] X Trustworthy Source American Psychological Association Leading scientific and professional organization of licensed psychologists Go to source A healthy, flowing stream signifies our ability to experience joy, pain, and fear, and to empathize. If you see poop floating in a toilet, bathtub, or other body of water in your dream, it’s likely a sign your feelings are contaminated by something. You won’t be able to feel the full spectrum of emotion until you identify this problem and release those pent-up feelings. Oftentimes, dealing with your emotions is simply a matter of not judging them. Rather than labeling some emotions as bad or crappy (anger, sadness), recognize that, like poop, they’re natural and allow yourself to feel them fully."

If your stool is runny or you have diarrhea in your dream, it’s a sign things in your life may not be as stable as you may think.

The pants symbolize a sort of mental or emotional safety net that prevents you from being exposed and dealing with seemingly-crappy situations head-on. While confronting your fears or specific people in your life directly may feel messy, this barrier you’re putting up is preventing you from experiencing the full spectrum of life.

      "content": "Dreaming of someone else’s poop shows relationship conflict. If you see or smell somebody else’s feces in your dream, you’re likely experiencing some form of anger, bitterness, or resentment toward that person. That person is making a “mess” in your life and you’re not giving enough credit to how much it’s affecting you. [11] X Research source The best way to deal with resentment is to identify what’s causing this animosity. Ask yourself when this resentment started and look inward to consider anything you may have done to exacerbate the situation. [12] X Research source When in doubt, talk to the person you feel resentful of. Kindly but clearly communicate that your feelings are hurt for whatever reason and you feel like a wall has gone up between you."

Your subconscious is telling you that you’ve done the necessary work to move forward and you’re ready to wipe away the past with a clean slate. [13] X Research source While it may seem inconsequential (or even gross), pay attention to whose poop you’re wiping. If it’s yours, it’s a sign you’ve done the inner emotional work to better your life. If it’s someone else’s, it could mean you’ve also outgrown that person."

If you dream of your bed being soiled, it could mean these things are in jeopardy. If you’re currently in a relationship, put extra effort into making your partner feel appreciated .

If you dream of not only seeing and smelling another person’s excrement but having that person hurl or toss their waste at you, there’s likely some tension in your relationship. You either feel alienated or like you’ve alienated them. [16] X Research source Talking about this dream to the person you dreamed about can be a great way to diffuse tension and inject humor into the conversation if your relationship is feeling frayed.

[18] X Research source Combine that with its association to money and seeing green poop in your dream likely means your future outcome is income (and it’s likely a pretty secure form of revenue).

      "content": "Brown poop represents growth. Brown is the color of soil and Mother Earth. [19] X Research source Therefore, if you dream of brown poop, your subconscious is reminding you of the importance of growing. This might be some positive encouragement to show you that you’ve already grown or a reminder that you need to grow up. Use context clues to determine how you think the theme of growth is manifesting in your mind. For example, if your dream was focused on cleaning or getting rid of brown feces, that probably means you’re moving ahead in life. However, if you dream of brown poop covering your walls, it’s likely you’re feeling stifled and need to outgrow the situation."

It may sound strange but think about it: rusty yellow is a stool color we tend to outgrow after toddlerhood. If you witness mustardy poop in your dream (but you haven’t seen it in real life in years), this may mean something from your childhood has a deep hold on your subconscious and you need to look back on past experiences to overcome it. An easy way to embrace your inner child is to engage in fun, childlike activities. Try fingerpainting, singing songs , or playing a game of tag with your friends. [20] X Research source"

[24] X Research source Add in the poopiness of it all and it’s likely your mind feels like there’s a waste it can’t get rid of. You’re either creatively, emotionally, or spiritually stifled. If you have the same type of poop dream, take that as extra evidence of the type of spiritual blockage you’re experiencing. For example, if you keep seeing floating poop when you fall asleep, it’s a sign your issue is emotional. If it’s another person’s poop, it’s intrapersonal, etc. To feel less stuck in your dreams, work on breaking up life’s stress and monotony while you’re awake. Try breathing exercises to center yourself and make small life changes to shake things up (take a new way to work, learn a new language, engage with a new hobby, etc)."
