      "content": "Neurospicy is a new, playful way of saying “neurodivergent” online. “Neurospicy” is intended to capture the complexity of neurodivergence without necessarily sounding too serious (or being specific about the exact condition you might have). After all, “spicy” evokes the idea of vivid flavors—and similarly, “neurospicy” is all about the intensity and variety of neurodivergent personalities. [1] X Research source Neurospicy is a descriptor often used by people who are neurodivergent themselves. It’s just a fun and less intimidating way to talk about being neurodivergent!"

      "content": "There’s no clear point of origin for neurospicy. However, the significance of “neurospicy” (and terms like it) likely stems from the desire to change the narrative surrounding neurodivergence, and autism in particular. Neurotypical people sometimes use terms to “measure” autism (like “high-functioning” or “mild autism”), but those terms often end up undermining autistic people and their experiences. [2] X Research source For example, autistic people with lower support needs may be misunderstood or invalidated when labeled “high-functioning,” while terms like “low-functioning” can be disrespectful to people with more support needs and erase their innate strengths. In response to those terms, neurodivergent people have advocated replacing them with terms that more accurately reflect the complexity of their experiences—like “neurospicy.”"

      "content": "Neurodivergent is an umbrella term for people with diverse thinking styles. A neurodivergent person is someone whose brain follows different thinking patterns than the established norm or experiences the world differently from what is considered “typical.” It’s not a condition itself; rather, neurodivergence encompasses many conditions . This includes: [3] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Autism ADHD and ADD Certain mental health conditions (like bipolar disorder, OCD, and so on) Down syndrome Dyscalculia Dysgraphia Dyslexia Dyspraxia Epilepsy Social anxiety Synesthesia Tourette syndrome Williams syndrome"

Neurodiversity is an inclusive word, acknowledging both neurodivergent and neurotypical people. [4] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Medical School Harvard Medical School's Educational Site for the Public Go to source Being neurodivergent isn’t necessarily a disability; some conditions under the neurodivergent umbrella are considered disabilities, while others aren’t. It’s been estimated that over a third of the population could be neurodivergent in some way. A group of people with different brain types can be described as \"neurodiverse.\""

      "content": "The idea of neurodiversity evolved in the later 1990s. It was developed collectively by autistic people (though it applies to more than autism). [5] X Research source [6] X Research source One of the earliest uses of the word \"neurodiversity\" was in controversial Australian sociologist Judy Singer’s 1998 honors thesis . The word \"neurodiversity\" quickly became more widely known, as did terms like \"neurodivergent\" and \"neurotypical\"—both by academics and the public."

      "content": "The neurodiversity paradigm is a way to think about neurodiversity. According to the neurodiversity paradigm, there’s no single way a brain should work—and that there are many different ways of thinking across the human population. [7] X Research source The neurodiversity movement builds on this. It is a social justice movement advocating inclusion, support, and acceptance for the neurodivergent population. [8] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Medical School Harvard Medical School's Educational Site for the Public Go to source The neurodiversity movement is also a disability rights movement. It argues that society should provide neurodivergent people equal access to care and support. The neurodiversity movement is large, with many sub-groups and sub-focuses. Some people argue that the neurodiversity movement tends to focus on some groups more than others, e.g. prioritizing lower-support autistic people's voices over higher-support ones."

      "title": "Some like “neurospicy” and feel it affirms the concept of neurodivergence.",
      "content": "Some like “neurospicy” and feel it affirms the concept of neurodivergence. Neurospicy isn’t an official medical term; it comes from the online neurodivergent community. Because of this, some neurodivergent people consider it a fun and creative way to redefine how their minds work. The term “neurospicy” is also a way to push back against derogatory or offensive language referring to neurodivergent people. Neurospicy is considered a positive term because it can describe someone who experiences multiple types of neurodivergence—or a group of neurodivergent people (like a family or friend group). Additionally, some use “neurospicy” because it lets them convey that they’re neurodivergent without actually naming their diagnosis or condition. The \"neurospicy\" word challenges the idea that someone's experiences are \"mild.\" For people whose neurodivergence is often invalidated, this can feel empowering. [9] X Research source"

      "content": "Others feel uncomfortable using casual or silly terms like “neurospicy.” Although “neurospicy” isn’t inherently negative, some neurodivergent people don’t like it and feel it trivializes their experiences. For example, podcaster Danielle Sullivan questioned whether “neurospicy” was just a way for neurotypical people to avoid saying “disabled.” [10] X Research source Some women of color may dislike being described as \"spicy\" in any way due to racist and sexist stereotypes. [11] X Research source Some neurodivergent people say they don't identify with it simply because they don't like spice. For those with sensory sensitivities, spice might be associated with pain and stress instead of fun. [12] X Research source Ultimately, some resonate with the term, and others don’t, preferring to use “neurodivergent” or the name of their condition (like “autistic”)—but both sides are valid!"

As long as you’re neurodivergent and enjoy the idea of calling yourself “neurospicy,” there’s no reason not to describe yourself that way! It’s an especially helpful word when you don’t want a conversation to get too heavy, serious, or awkward. “I’m definitely a bit neurospicy!” “Got a diagnosis recently—apparently I’m neurospicy, haha.

If they don’t like the term, don’t call them neurospicy; use the terms they prefer instead. “Love hanging out with you and all our other neurospicy friends. We get each other!” “Since you’re also neurospicy, I’d love to get your opinion on this!”"
