      "content": "Cut off a piece of cactus at a 45-degree angle with a serrated knife . Wait until the spring and summer months to propagate your cacti, or else the roots may not establish. Put on a pair of thick gardening gloves to hold onto the cactus. Make your cut anywhere along the cactus stem at a 45-degree angle. [1] X Research source Taking cuttings works best on tall columnar cacti. Cacti propagate best when nighttime temperatures stay above 60 °F (16 °C). If you’re taking cuttings from multiple cacti, disinfect your knife after each plant with a solution that’s 1 part bleach and 9 parts water to prevent the spread of bacteria."

      "title": "Leave the cutting in a dry, shaded area until it forms a callus.",
      "content": "Leave the cutting in a dry, shaded area until it forms a callus. Lay the cutting sideways in a tray so the cut portion is exposed to the air. Leave the cutting alone in a dry, shady place and let the bottom dry out, which may take 1–2 days, or up to several weeks. Feel the bottom of the cutting to make sure it’s dry to the touch before you plant it. [2] X Research source If you plant a fresh cutting without letting it dry out first, then it’s more susceptible to developing rot and dying."

    {
      "title": "Dip the cutting in rooting hormone.",
      "content": "Dip the cutting in rooting hormone . Rooting hormone helps a plant develop a strong root system so it establishes in the soil easier. Dip the callused end of the cactus cutting into the rooting hormone powder or solution just before you plant them. [3] X Research source Many cacti easily take root without using hormones, but using it helps promote healthy root growth even more."

      "title": "Push the bottom of the cutting into a pot filled with perlite and compost.",
      "content": "Push the bottom of the cutting into a pot filled with perlite and compost . Use a 1 US gal (3.8 L) pot that has drainage holes so it doesn’t hold water. Poke a hole in the growing medium with your finger that’s large enough to fit the bottom of your cutting. Set the callused end of the cutting into the hole so about a third of it is buried. Fill in the growing medium around the cutting so it doesn’t shift or fall over. If you notice the cutting leaning or tipping over, bury it slightly deeper so it stands up on its own. Use a 50/50 mix of perlite and compost for the best result. Alternatively, use a cactus potting mix that’s specifically made so it doesn’t hold too much water."

    {
      "title": "Mist the soil with water when it dries out on the surface.",
      "content": "Mist the soil with water when it dries out on the surface. When you first plant the cutting into the pot, wet the soil with a watering can until you see moisture coming out from the drainage holes. After that, feel the surface of the soil to see if it’s dry to the touch. If it still feels damp, leave it alone until it dries out. Then use a spray bottle filled with clean water and wet the soil until it’s slightly wet to help establish the roots . [4] X Research source Use purified or distilled water if you can because tap water may contain chemicals that impact your plant’s growth."

Put the pot in a brightly-lit area, such as a patio, greenhouse, or south-facing window sill where it doesn’t get direct sunlight. Leave the pot undisturbed while the cutting takes root. [5] X Research source Some cacti species grow better in partially shaded areas, so check the light requirements for the specific species you’re growing."

      "content": "Check for new growth within 4–6 weeks. Continue caring for the cactus cutting and check if there are any new growths sprouting from it. If there are, then the cactus has developed strong and healthy roots. If your cactus still hasn’t produced growths, then continue keeping the cactus in light for 6 hours each day and misting the soil when it dries out. [6] X Research source The time it takes for your cactus to root depends on the specific species you’re growing."

During the spring or summer, look for healthy offsets growing around the base of your cactus or for any large healthy pads growing off of the main stalk. Pinch the offset or pad with a pair of tongs to separate it from the cactus. If the offset or pad doesn’t easily separate from the main plant, then use a serrated knife to cut through where it attaches to the main stalk. [7] X Research source If you can’t get a good grip with a pair of tongs, put on a pair of gardening gloves and twist the pad or offset off by hand."

      "title": "Leave the pad or offset to dry for 2–3 days.",
      "content": "Leave the pad or offset to dry for 2–3 days. Lay the pad or offset in a dry, shaded area so the exposed section has time to form a callus. Let the piece you removed from your cactus sit for about 2–3 days and check if the end hardened over. Once it feels dry and hard to the touch, the offset or pad is ready to plant. [8] X Research source Planting the cactus before it calluses over could cause the root system to rot."

      "content": "Plant the offset or pad into a pot with a mix of perlite and compost. Choose a 1 US gal (3.8 L) pot that has drainage holes in the bottom, and fill it with an equal mix of perlite and compost . Poke a hole in the soil, and stick the bottom third of the offset or pad into it. Firm up the soil around the newly propagated cactus so it can establish roots. While you may dip the end of the offset or pad into a rooting hormone before you plant it, cacti easily establish roots without it."

      "title": "Water the soil lightly when it dries out.",
      "content": "Water the soil lightly when it dries out. Use a watering can to wet the soil initially until you see it come out of the pot’s drainage holes. After that, let the soil dry out completely in between waterings so the plant doesn’t become waterlogged. If the soil feels dry, mist it with a spray bottle or water it lightly with a watering can. [9] X Research source Avoid letting water pool on the surface of the soil because that could drown your cactus or cause it to develop root rot."

Cut 2 pieces of twine that are long enough to wrap around the top of the scion and underneath the bottom of the pot. Tie one of the pieces of twine around the scion so it’s held tightly against the stalk, but not so tight that it cuts into the plant. Then, secure the second piece of twine over the scion so it crosses over the first piece.
