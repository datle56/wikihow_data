      "content": "Try a ladder workout. Ladder workouts, or pyramid workouts, involve starting with a short distance, gradually working up to a longer distance, and then working your way back down to the original shorter distance. For example, run 200 metres (0.12 mi), 400 metres (0.25 mi), 800 metres (0.50 mi), 400 metres (0.25 mi), and then 200 metres (0.12 mi) at a medium pace with 2-3 minutes of rest in between. This kind of workout can improve your endurance and pacing. You can also do reverse ladder workouts, where you start at a longer distance, work your way down to a shorter distance, and then finish at the longest original distance. Do this type of workout 2-3 times each week when getting into shape for track season."

      "content": "Run shorter distances repeatedly to improve your speed. Practice running 100 metres (110 yd) and/or 200 metres (220 yd) over and over again to improve your sprinting ability. Focusing on these shorter distances may help you to develop speed, pacing ability, and strength. [1] X Research source Try doing a workout where you run 4 total laps. Run continuously as you sprint the 100 m (110 yd) straightaways and jog the 100 m (110 yd) curves of each lap. For best results, focus on sprinting shorter distances 2-3 times each week."

Run 800 metres (0.50 mi) and 1,600 metres (0.99 mi) at a time during your workouts to gain endurance. [2] X Research source Try doing a workout where you jog 1,000 metres (0.62 mi) 5 times with a 90-second resting break between each one. To successfully gain endurance, focus on running longer distances 2 or 3 times every week. Slow, easy miles will help you gradually prepare your body for track.

      "content": "Do lower body strength training once or twice a week. While running is the more obvious way to condition your body for running track, lifting weights is necessary for strengthening your muscles effectively. Incorporate lower body strength training exercises into your workouts 1-2 times each week to build up your leg muscles for running. Some exercises you can try include: [4] X Research source Squats Forward lunges Calf raises Situps"

      "content": "Add in weekly upper body strength training. While it may not seem like it, building your upper body is also very important for running track. Your chest, shoulders, and arms should be strong for driving your arms as you run, and a strong back may help you to maintain good posture while running. Try to incorporate some of the following upper body strength training exercises into your workouts about once a week: [5] X Research source Bench presses Upright rows Biceps curls Planks"

      "content": "Eat healthy, balanced meals. At track practice each day, you’ll be exerting a lot of energy. Because of this, it’s important to eat healthy meals that can effectively provide the nutrients that your body needs. Eat an energizing breakfast each day to kickstart your metabolism and a lunch that contains both protein and leafy greens. Eat foods that are high in protein and carbohydrates just after your workouts. [6] X Research source Try eating oatmeal with berries or a couple of eggs, a piece of toast, and a glass of orange juice for breakfast. Consider eating a grilled chicken breast with a big salad that has carrots, cucumbers, and peppers in it for lunch. Incorporate spaghetti and marinara sauce, potatoes, lean meats, and/or fava beans into your post-workout meals."

      "content": "Ask your coach for advice. It’s a good idea to approach the track season with a few goals in mind. Bring up your weaknesses with your coach and ask them if they can help you improve in those areas. This may help you make progress and also get closer to your coach. If you’re struggling with a certain physical setback, such as pacing or hurdling form, ask your coach for advice on how to get better. You can also talk to your coach about how to handle certain mental struggles, such as dealing with a big loss."

      "content": "Get 9-10 hours of sleep the night before. As an athlete, you’ll need to sleep more in order to give your body the proper amount of rest and recovery time. This will allow your body to perform as well as possible. Try to get a minimum of 8 hours of sleep the night before you compete in a meet. Getting 9 or 10 hours is even better."

Fill up your water bottle before starting your day and keep it on you all day long so that you can stay hydrated.

      "content": "Try to keep a positive mindset. When you’re about to compete, it’s important to think optimistically. It can be easy to let the pressure get the best of you, but that will only stress you out and possibly hinder your performance. When negative thoughts of self-doubt pop into your head, give yourself positive reminders, such as: You’ve prepared the best you can, and that’s what matters. You are capable of doing well. Everything happens for a reason."

[16] X Research source Be sure to get some running shoes that have proper support to prevent injuries, a water bottle, and a water-resistant duffel bag to keep everything in.

The sprinting events in track include the 100 m (110 yd) dash, the 200 m (220 yd) dash, and the 400 m (440 yd), each of which you can run on your own or in a relay with 3 other people. [17] X Research source In a relay race, the first runner in a team of 4 starts with a baton and passes it to the next person immediately after they’ve finished running the required distance. Then, the second person runs the same required distance and passes it to the third team member and the cycle continues. The 4th team member crosses the finish line with the baton."

      "content": "Go for middle or long distance events if you have endurance. In track, there are several different longer races that your school or running program may or may not offer. Typically there is a 800 m (0.50 mi) race, 1,600 m (0.99 mi) race, and a 3,200 m (2.0 mi), but the options vary by school and track type. Consider doing one or more of these events if you feel stronger and faster as a distance runner. Especially at the collegiate level, there are farther distance options, sometimes as long as 10,000 m (6.2 mi)!"

Either way, you’ll have 10 evenly-spaced hurdles set up on the track in your lane that you have to jump over on your way to the finish line.
