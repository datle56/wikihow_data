      "content": "Be aware of your child’s risk for FAS. The exact cause of FAS is alcohol consumption. The more you drink while pregnant, especially during the first trimester, the greater the risk of your unborn fetus developing FAS. Being aware of your child’s risk for this disease can help you recognize it and get a diagnosis and treatment in a timely manner. Alcohol reaches the developing fetus through the placenta and causes higher blood alcohol concentration levels in a fetus than in you. A fetus metabolizes alcohol at a much slower rate. Alcohol interferes with oxygenation and nutrition delivery to your unborn baby. This can severely impact the fetus’s developing tissues and organs, including the brain. You may have consumed a lot of alcohol before you realized you were pregnant, putting your unborn baby at risk for FAS. Keep this in mind during and after your pregnancy."
