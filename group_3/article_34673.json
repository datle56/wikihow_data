It's much easier for the body to run on one night of no sleep than one night of no sleep and one night of bad sleep, so make a plan to sleep as much as you can the night before. Also make sure staying up all night doesn’t become a regular habit, as it could lead to serious health issues.

If you wake up around 8:00 or 9:00, you'll be less tired when it's time to start really staying up. Try not only waking up really late but going to bed a bit late the night before. If you go to bed at nine at night the night before, your body will start getting tired around that time. If you can, take an extended nap a few hours before you plan to stay up. This will give you an extra boost of rest and energy.

If you want to pull an all-nighter, you have to eat three healthy and balanced meals the day before you try to stay up, or your body will feel tired from unhealthy foods or fatigued from undernourishment. Here's what you should eat the day before: [4] X Research source Have a big, healthy breakfast. Eat healthy carbs like oatmeal or wheat-based cereal, proteins like lean turkey or ham, and some fruits and vegetables. Add a yogurt or cottage cheese to your meal. Have a healthy lunch. Eat a sandwich with wheat bread, a hard-boiled egg, or a big salad with avocado, carrots, cucumbers, and tomatoes. Whatever you eat should give you a boost of energy without making you feel sluggish. Eat the right dinner for staying up all night. This will be the last meal you eat before you prepare to stay up all night, so make it count. Avoid greasy or fattening foods that will make you feel bloated or heavy. Instead, eat some chicken or turkey, couscous, whole grain pasta, fruits, and vegetables. Make sure you have some carbohydrates for energy, and some proteins like soy, chicken, or ham. Avoid heavily caffeinated or sugary foods. [5] X Research source If you drink coffee all day or eat sugary snacks like candy, then you'll be crashing and ready for bed after dinner. [6] X Research source"

You'll be less likely to fall asleep if parts of your body is active and engaged. [8] X Research source Do a simple movement, like tapping your feet and stretching. If it becomes a habit, it might just save you from falling asleep during those final dire moments and it can keep you awake without being distracting. Stretch. Stretching your forearms, calves, and wrists will make your body feel more active and less tight. Roll your shoulders backward and forward and circle your head from side to side. Give yourself a quick hand massage. Tap your foot on the floor. If you're really falling asleep, pinch yourself or bite down on your tongue. Gently tug your earlobes. Chew gum or suck on a mint to keep your mouth active. If your eyes are getting tired, rest them out a window or gaze in a new location. Stimulate your senses. Turn up the bright lights and play some medium-loud music to jolt your senses awake. Try keeping music on in the background. If it has a good beat, you may find yourself naturally tapping your foot to the tempo."

To keep your mind alert, you have to switch tasks from time to time and to stay mentally engaged in whatever you're doing. [9] X Research source Here's how to stimulate your mind: Pay attention. Notice everything that's going on around you, and ask questions if you don't understand something, like a section in your textbook that is unclear to you during a study session. Strike up a conversation. If you're in the middle of a cram session, it's easy to keep talking to the people around you. If you're at home and struggling to stay awake, call up a night owl friend or have a quick conversation with a friend online. [10] X Research source Stay engaged. If you're watching a movie, ask yourself questions about it to make sure that you understand everything that's going on. Don't let yourself drift off. If you're watching television or having a conversation, make sure that you're focused on the task at hand instead of daydreaming."

Switch up your environment. If you can change your environment, it will be easier for you to stay stimulated. If you're cramming for an exam, move to a different part of the library or your dorm. If you're at a sleepover, just try getting everyone to hang out in a different room from time to time. Hang out in a different part of the same room. If you're nodding off at your friend's New Year's party, just move from the couch to the kitchen and keep talking to people. If you have to keep sitting down, pick a different seat."

Any fruit or healthy food is better than eating sugary foods. [17] X Research source Avoid eating a heavy meal the evening of the all-nighter. This will leave you feeling lethargic and sleepy.

[19] X Research source Eat a hard-boiled egg or quickly make an egg sunny-side up if you're at home. Eat a handful of almonds, cashews, or pecans. Eat a crispy apple, celery, or carrot sticks. Just crunching into these foods will wake up your mouth and will make you more alert. Bananas are great for all-nighters because they keep you awake for longer than usual and give you a great source of Vitamin B1 and potassium. Have a piece of toast with a little bit of peanut butter. If you're craving a fourth meal, try to have a healthy carbohydrate like brown rice and protein like turkey. If you can't avoid ordering out, try picking foods that aren't too greasy or fatty."
