    {
      "title": "“Ti amo” (tee AH-mo).",
      "content": "“Ti amo” (tee AH-mo). Use this phrase to express deep love for a romantic partner. This is the direct translation of “I love you” into Italian, and indicates that you’ve taken your relationship to the next level. [1] X Research source To make this expression stronger, say “ti amo così tanto” (tee AH-mo coh-SEE TAHN-to), or, “I love you so much.” To sound even more romantic, you can even say, “Ti amo con tutto il cuore” (tee AH-mo con TOO-to eel KWO-reh), or, “I love you with all my heart.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "“Ti voglio bene” (tee VOL-yo BEN-eh).",
      "content": "“Ti voglio bene” (tee VOL-yo BEN-eh). This phrase signifies a deep relationship, although not necessarily a romantic one. Although this expression directly translates to “I want good things for you,” it’s also how you would say “I love you” to a friend or family member. [2] X Research source Make this expression even stronger by saying, “Ti voglio un mondo di bene” (tee VOL-yo oon MON-do dee BEN-eh), which could be translated into English as, “I want a world of good things for you.” Keep in mind that some long-term spouses will also use “Ti voglio bene” with each other—this expression doesn’t always mean that a relationship isn’t romantic."
    },
    {
      "title": "“Sono innamorato di te” (SO-no een-ah-mo-RA-to dee teh).",
      "content": "“Sono innamorato di te” (SO-no een-ah-mo-RA-to dee teh). This sentence directly translates to “I’m in love with you.” Like in English, saying you’re in love with someone is a strong declaration of your feelings, so use it carefully. [3] X Research source Italian is a language that uses grammatical gender. If you’re a woman, say “sono innamorata di te” (SO-no een-ah-mo-RA-ta dee teh), instead of “inamorato.”"
