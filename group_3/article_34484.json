      "content": "Use a surge protector. This is not to be confused with a power strip. A surge protector will look like a bulky power strip. When your home receives a power spike, the surge protector takes this spike and pushes it away from the outlets and your computer. Remember that even the best surge protectors will not protect against a direct lightning strike. [2] X Research source For ultimate protection, if you happen to be home, unplug the surge protector in the case of a threatening storm. The use of surge arresters can prevent damage through a shunt device that activates in one nanosecond or less. When the arrester detects a voltage spike, it instantly reroutes the voltage to the ground and saves the devices from being affected."

      "content": "Determine if your electronic set up requires an uninterruptible power supply device, also know as a UPS device. Whereas surge protectors protect surges of power, these UPS devices protect against outages . Outages and dips in power, even if minor, can cause hard or soft damage (like data loss) to certain equipment - for example, external hard drives or advanced telecommunication equipment. A UPS will be particularly beneficial if you have a home office or continually run operations on your electronics. Most UPS devices will also protect your devices from power surges."

      "content": "Consider if damage has already occurred. Even if your computer appears to be working you should still give it a check over in case a strike has left it in a dangerous state that might result in electric shock or fire. If any of your telephones or other electronics show signs of damage, it's wise to assume that your computer took a hit too."
