[2] X Research source Hold ice or an ice pack wrapped in a towel to your neck every 3 to 4 hours. Apply ice for the first 3 days, then switch to heat. During the first 2 to 3 days, applying ice can help relieve muscle pain and inflammation."

Great oils to use include peppermint, lemongrass, or arnica essential oil. [6] X Research source Capsaicin cream can cause burning and irritation when you first apply it. For most people, this sensation goes away. If you find the cream uncomfortable, try another natural muscle relaxer. Talk to your doctor before using any supplements, herbs, or creams."

      "content": "Wear a neck collar during activities that aggravate your pain. Purchase a supportive collar online or at your local pharmacy. Look for products labeled “supportive neck brace” or “cervical collar.” Wear it for about 2 to 3 hours at a time for up to 4 days. [8] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Medical School Harvard Medical School's Educational Site for the Public Go to source For instance, a neck collar might be helpful if you have to make a long drive, if you get sore while you're work, or if you can't put off doing household chores. Wearing a collar now and then while you’re in pain can help take stress off of your SCM. However, long-term use can weaken the neck muscles and isn’t recommended. Make sure you take off your collar for long periods of time every day. Do range-of-motion exercises several times a day to help supplement your neck collar. For example, do a slow rotation clockwise and then counter-clockwise."

If you alternate positions, keep a spare pillow handy so you can double up your head support when you shift to your side. If it’s in your budget, consider swapping an older, plush mattress for a new medium-firm one. For a more affordable option, a firm mattress pad can also help support your back and neck."
