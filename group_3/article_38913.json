They will just add a Wi-Fi router to your existing network connection to provide wireless connectivity. If you prefer doing stuff on your own, you can purchase your own Wi-Fi router from your local computer store for under $100 and add it to your home network by following the included instructions inside its box."

This makes the calls, if not at all free, a lot cheaper than your normal phone calls using your landline or mobile network. There are several VoIP apps that you can find on Google Play Store.
