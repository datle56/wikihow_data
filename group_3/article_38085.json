If the liquid touches the circuits on the laptop while they are active, your laptop will most likely short out, so time is very much of the essence. [1] X Research source To disconnect the laptop from a power source, simply remove the charger cable from the laptop. It's typically on the left or right side of the laptop's housing."

You can typically do this by turning your laptop upside-down, sliding a panel off of the bottom of the laptop, and gently tugging on the battery. [3] X Research source This step is not possible on some laptops, including MacBooks without first unscrewing the bottom of the laptop from the rest of the housing."

Depending on your laptop's flexibility, doing so will result in anything from a tent-shaped laptop to a completely flat one. To speed up the process of drying the liquid you can angle a fan at the liquid to help evaporate the liquid faster. [5] X Research source"

If you're uncomfortable or unfamiliar with the notion of removing RAM, your computer's hard drive, and other detachable internal components, consider taking your laptop into a professional repair service instead. [7] X Research source You can typically find manuals for your specific computer that detail hardware replacement and removal online. Simply search for your computer's make and model number followed by \"RAM removal\" (or whichever component you need to remove). For a MacBook, you'll first have to unscrew each of the ten screws holding the base of the housing together."
