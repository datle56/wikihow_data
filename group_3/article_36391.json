      "title": "Wash your face less often.",
      "content": "Wash your face less often. The oil our faces naturally produce is called sebum. It's a beneficial oil that protects our skin and keeps it flexible and healthy. Washing it away too frequently results in your pores producing more oil to make up for what was lost. This overproduction is what leads to the appearance of oily skin. To prevent this from happening: [5] X Research source Wash your face (with oil) just once a day. If you need to remove oil in between washings, use blotting paper instead of washing your face. Moisturize your face after washing it.

It may take a few days of using this new routine for your face to balance out."

      "title": "Don't use drying products.",
      "content": "Don't use drying products. Using soaps and facial cleansers in an attempt to get rid of your face's oil will cause your pores to produce extra to make up for it. Wean yourself off of your soap-based facial cleansers, especially those containing harsh cleaning agents like sodium laurel sulfate. It's better to wash your face with plain water than to use a facial cleanser. Use the oil cleansing method when your face needs a deep cleansing. If you're worried about acne, use tea tree oil and other natural methods instead of resorting to harsh cleansers, which tend to irritate acne more."

      "content": "Use makeup that won't cause your face to produce more oil. Choosing your makeup wisely is a big part of oil control.

      "content": "Watch what you eat. While more research is needed, some evidence suggests that what you eat can play a role in the development of excess oil and acne. In particular, foods that encourage your body to produce insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) may also cause an increase in sebum. [8] X Research source Foods that increase IGF-1 levels include dairy products, like milk and cheese, and foods with a high glycemic index (GI), like breads, cereals, pastas, refined grains, potatoes, melons, pineapples, pumpkins, and snack foods. [9] X Research source On the other hand, foods rich in omega-3 fatty acids may help clear your complexion. These include fatty fish, pastured eggs, soy products, spinach, nuts, and wild rice.
