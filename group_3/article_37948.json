      "content": "Pick a business that looks relatively clean. Sure, all public bathrooms are germ-infested to some extent—but some places are definitely cleaner than others. If you have multiple options to choose from, opt for a place like a cafe or coffee shop that gets less traffic and has cleaner bathrooms than a more bustling place (like a mall restroom, airport restroom, etc.). Some places might require you to buy something before you use the restroom. Hospitals could be a good bet, since they likely disinfectant their facilities frequently."

      "content": "Only touch things if you really need to. You’ll need to touch the door handle to get in the bathroom, along with the stall latch (and possibly the soap dispenser and faucet), but try not to touch any other surfaces unless you absolutely have to. Surfaces in public bathrooms can carry a variety of different bacteria. [1] X Trustworthy Source PLOS ONE Online peer-reviewed, open access scientific research journal Go to source"

      "content": "Slide into the stall closest to the entrance. According to certain research, people naturally gravitate toward centrally-aligned items, like a bathroom stall. Because of this mentality, the stall that neighbors the entrance is a little less germ-ridden than the others. Choose this one when you step in the bathroom if you’re a big stickler about staying clean. [2] X Research source Warning: Don’t put any of your belongings on the bathroom floor, if possible. Instead, use the provided hook on the stall door (if there is one)."

      "content": "Clean off the seat before using it. As icky as it is, check and see if the previous person left any urine on the seat. Using a big wad of toilet paper, carefully wipe it up and toss it in the toilet without physically touching the seat. Contrary to popular belief, sitting directly on the toilet is generally more sanitary than squatting or standing in a bathroom stall."

[3] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Medical School Harvard Medical School's Educational Site for the Public Go to source If your public restroom toilet happens to have a lid, close it before flushing to prevent this from happening. If the toilet is automatic, try to shut it as soon as you get up from using the toilet. If the toilet has a manual handle, grab it with a sheet of toilet paper (or press it with your foot) instead of touching it with your bare hand."

Although arguably better for the environment, research indicates that air dryers are not great in terms of hygiene—they actually help germs spread around. If it’s an option, dry your hands off with paper towels instead.

Hand sanitizer is by no means a miracle cure that kills all germs known to man, but it can still help keep your hands pretty clean. Apply a small amount of product to your hands and rub it all over the skin until your hands no longer feel wet."

If you’re feeling anxious or uncomfortable about using the bathroom for any reason, see if a friend or loved one is comfortable going with you. If you run into anyone rude or hostile, having a physical support system will make it much easier to handle the situation."

Unfortunately, it’s impossible to change or control what other people think—but you can control how you present yourself. Stand at your full height and walk into the bathroom confidently. Once you’re inside, do your business and leave without interacting with anyone else there. Acting confident is good advice for navigating any public space as a trans or gender-nonconforming individual. [6] X Research source"
