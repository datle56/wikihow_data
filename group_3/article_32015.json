      "content": "Discuss your fears with a therapist. It is not always necessary to use a therapist to treat phobias, but some people may feel more comfortable having a professional to guide them through different strategies. The most common methods for treating phobias are exposure therapy and cognitive therapy. Many therapists will be open to trying other methods such as social learning theory (modeling), biofeedback, and hypnotherapy. When it comes to deciding between self-administering and seeking a therapist, you should consider the severity of your phobia and your need for support. If your phobia is so severe that you have uncontrollable anxiety or panic attacks, or your fear keeps you from participating in activities such as office picnics or watching your son’s baseball game, then you should have additional support.

Since it may not be possible to safely expose yourself to a large amount of wasps and/or bees, a therapist might ask you to vividly imagine that bees and/or wasps are all around you. This is called imaginal exposure.

I know, if I see one again, it will sting me.” Catastrophizing is when you imagine that an encounter will be as bad as it could possibly be. “If I see a wasp or bee then there is probably a nest or hive nearby.
