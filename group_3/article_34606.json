      "title": "Trim outdoor ficuses anytime in late summer, fall, or spring.",
      "content": "Trim outdoor ficuses anytime in late summer, fall, or spring. Outdoor ficuses are fairly adaptable and can be trimmed during most seasons. Anytime from late summer to early spring is ideal, as this is right before and after your ficus’s dormant season. [1] X Research source Try not to prune your outdoor tree in early summer, as this can induce an off-season growth spurt and leave your plant more vulnerable to frost."

      "title": "Prune indoor ficuses in summer, autumn, or early spring.",
      "content": "Prune indoor ficuses in summer, autumn, or early spring. Indoor ficuses need regular pruning to remove old leaves and shape the plant to its living space. Avoid pruning your indoor ficus in mid-spring, however, particularly when it is forming new leaves and buds. [2] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Shape ficuses in winter.",
      "content": "Shape ficuses in winter. For extensive shaping, wait until your plant’s dormant season in winter. During this period, your ficus is least likely to sustain shock from pruning, and, with outdoor plants, you’ll be able to see the branch structure better. [3] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Prune away diseased, broken, or dead branches anytime.",
      "content": "Prune away diseased, broken, or dead branches anytime. Dying or dead branches can weaken your tree and make it vulnerable to further damage. To prevent this from happening, remove damaged branches as soon as you notice them. If your tree is weak, avoid pruning it unless it’s to trim or cut away damaged areas. Both indoor and outdoor ficuses are vulnerable to a number of pests (like mites, mealybugs, and aphids) which can cause disease and damage. Use an insecticide like neem oil to fight off pests, and dispose of infected leaves and branches immediately to stop the spread of disease."

      "title": "Prune your ficus in the spring if you want it to grow fuller.",
      "content": "Prune your ficus in the spring if you want it to grow fuller. If you’ve noticed excessively thin areas on your ficus, pruning can encourage branching. Try trimming your ficus in early springtime to encourage branch and foliage growth during the next season. [4] X Research source If you've noticed thinning in summer or early fall, wait until the following season to prune."

    {
      "title": "Put on gardening gloves before handling your ficus.",
      "content": "Put on gardening gloves before handling your ficus. Most ficus varieties excrete a toxic milky sap that causes skin irritation. To prevent rashes, wear thick gloves and long sleeves while pruning your ficus. [5] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Gloves made with latex or thin fabrics will not protect your skin from the ficus’s sap. Opt for thick gardening gloves instead, which are available at most plant nurseries or garden centers."
    },
    {
      "title": "Remove dead or dying branches.",
      "content": "Remove dead or dying branches. If your ficus has diseased, damaged, or dead branches, prune them away at a downward slant with your loppers or shears. Cut the damaged branch back to a healthy area to help your tree heal and focus its energy on healthy branches. Dying or dead branches usually lose their bark and have gray or decaying wood. Diseased branches may have brown leaf spots or greasy-looking spots, excessive leaf drop, or yellowing near the veins. If you suspect the branches are diseased, sanitize your shears between each cut with 70% isopropyl alcohol to prevent the disease from spreading to the rest of the ficus."

    {
      "title": "Prune above leaf scars to encourage fuller growth.",
      "content": "Prune above leaf scars to encourage fuller growth. If your ficus tree has thinned out more than usual, inspect it for scars where leaves used to be. Clip directly above leaf scars to encourage thicker foliage as your plant grows . [6] X Research source Leaf scars are small, round marks found where your plant originally grew leaves. They’re usually lighter in color than the surrounding branch. Pruning above leaf scars should ideally be done in spring."

      "title": "Put cut paste on extensively pruned areas.",
      "content": "Put cut paste on extensively pruned areas. If you prune back large branches or make many cuts, apply cut paste over the clipped area. Pruning essentially creates many small wounds on a plant, and cut paste will help your tree heal and protect it from diseases and pests while it recovers. [7] X Research source Buy cut paste online or at most plant nurseries."

    {
      "title": "Discard ficus clippings immediately after pruning.",
      "content": "Discard ficus clippings immediately after pruning. Because ficus plants are toxic, their clippings cannot be used as a mulch or compost. Collect the clippings in a trash bag and discard them when you’re done pruning. [8] X Research source For an environmentally-friendly alternative, ask local recycling centers if they can make use of your ficus clippings."
    },
    {
      "title": "Don’t prune more than 30% of your ficus at a time.",
      "content": "Don’t prune more than 30% of your ficus at a time. Too much pruning can throw your tree into shock and leave it vulnerable to diseases. Limit yourself to removing less than 30% of your ficus’s foliage and branch structure at a time. If damage expands across more than 30% of the plant, hire a professional landscaper to determine the best treatment for it."

      "title": "Work with your tree’s natural shape.",
      "content": "Work with your tree’s natural shape. Ficuses are not ideal plants for extensive shaping. When pruning your tree, keep its initial shape in mind and aim for a trimmer, better-maintained version of its original pattern. In many cases, when a plant has been properly pruned, it’s difficult to tell that it’s been pruned at all. [9] X Research source Ficus trees are usually round and widest at the bottom. Plants that are pruned according to their natural shape typically require less maintenance than those pruned into an unusual shape. [10] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Thin out any overgrown areas.",
      "content": "Thin out any overgrown areas. Inspect your tree for branches that jut from the plant’s natural shape or overlap other branches. Cut these away with shears or loppers (depending on the size of the branch) directly above a node or where another stem branches off to minimize damage. Thinning out your ficus’s foliage helps light penetrate the tree, which can make the plant look fuller and give it better air flow."
    },
    {
      "title": "Cut back vertical branches.",
      "content": "Cut back vertical branches. Vertical branches can give your tree a bulky, awkward shape. Inspect your tree for any branches growing upward and prune them away with loppers or sheers to keep your ficus looking its best. [11] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Avoid removing lower branches or leaves.",
      "content": "Avoid removing lower branches or leaves. The lower leaves and branches bring essential nutrients to the trunk, and a strong trunk is essential for holding up the ficus’s foliage. [12] X Trustworthy Source EDIS Electronic database of the University of Florida Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences's peer-reviewed articles Go to source Thin or shape the lower branches lightly to keep your tree strong, but don’t remove them completely. This is especially true for smaller ficus trees like rubber trees and fiddle leaf figs."

    {
      "title": "Prune the roots to keep the ficus compact.",
      "content": "Prune the roots to keep the ficus compact. If you have low ceilings or keep your ficus in a confined space, trim the roots in addition to the branches to keep your tree from growing too large. Unpot the ficus and remove most of the potting soil from the rootstock. Use clean pruners to trim no more than ⅓ of the root system and remove any diseased or damaged roots. Then, repot the ficus and freshen the soil if needed. [13] X Research source If you decide to prune the roots, it’s essential to prune the branches as well. Otherwise, the plant would be too top heavy. While you don’t have to trim the roots to prune your ficus, it helps prevent the plant from producing leaves as quickly. If done incorrectly, root pruning can damage the tree, so only do this if you’re comfortable trimming the roots."

      "title": "Transplant or repot your ficus if it grows too large.",
      "content": "Transplant or repot your ficus if it grows too large. If you’ve cut back about 30% of your ficus and it is still too large for its pot or your backyard, try repotting or replanting it somewhere else. This can give your ficus more room to grow without sending it into shock from excessive pruning. [14] X Trustworthy Source Penn State Extension Educational organization dedicated to delivering science-based information to people, businesses, and communities Go to source Avoid transplanting trees with a trunk diameter wider than 2 inches (5.1 cm). Hire a landscaper or nursery professional to replant large ficus trees. [15] X Research source When repotting or replanting a ficus, be sure to use a well-draining, fertile soil. Soil-based potting mixes often work well and provide all needed nutrients. Avoid acidic soils, like those used for roses or azaleas. If you move your ficus, keep it in an area with a lot of light, but avoid placing it in direct sunlight, as this could scald the leaves."
