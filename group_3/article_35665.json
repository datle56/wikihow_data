      "content": "Hold an ice pack to your nose for 10-15 minutes at a time. Fill a wet washcloth with 5-6 ice cubes. Then, apply the ice pack directly against the swollen part of your nose, and hold it in place with moderate pressure. Pressing too hard may be painful or further damage your nose. The cold from the ice will reduce the swelling. Once 10-15 minutes have passed, remove the ice pack. [1] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source If you prefer not to use a washcloth, you can purchase a plastic ice pack from a pharmacy. Place it in the freezer for 3-4 hours before using. Do not hold ice cubes directly against your nose, as they may stick to the skin or cause frostbite."

[2] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Apply the ice pack at, for example, 9 a.m., 1 p.m., 5 p.m., and 9 p.m. If your nose is still swollen after 24 hours, use the ice pack for the next 24 hours as well. Using the ice pack more than this will not be effective at decreasing swelling. Holding the ice pack against your nose will also help reduce any pain associated with the injury or rhinoplasty."
