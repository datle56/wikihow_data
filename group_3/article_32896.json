      "content": "Soak the seeds. To make germination easier, consider soaking the seeds in tap water for 12 hours in a bowl. Viable seeds will sink to the bottom of the bowl and non-viable seeds will float. [1] X Research source After 12 hours, place the viable seeds on a towel."

      "title": "Wet one paper towel and put it on a plate.",
      "content": "Wet one paper towel and put it on a plate. Paper towels are thick enough to retain the moisture needed to help the seeds germinate. Place one paper towel under running water until it is wet to the touch, but not dripping wet. Use a ceramic dish or plate, as it will be strong enough to hold the towels and the seeds. The paper towel should cover the dish or plate. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Put the seeds 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) apart on the towel.",
      "content": "Put the seeds 1 ⁄ 2 inch (1.3 cm) apart on the towel. Place the blunt end of the seeds, the end that does not have a point, on the towel, spacing them apart so their roots do not get tangled. [3] X Research source If you do not have enough space on one plate for all your seeds, soak two more paper towels and put the remainder on a new plate covered in a wet paper towel."

      "content": "Store the seeds at 70 to 85 °F (21 to 29 °C). The cannabis seeds need to sit at a warm, consistent temperature to germinate. Store the seeds out of direct sunlight in a warm area, such as the top of your refrigerator. [5] X Research source You can try using a heat lamp near the seeds to keep them warm. Do not warm the seeds up too much, as you do not want your heat source to dry out the paper towels."

      "title": "Keep the paper towels moist.",
      "content": "Keep the paper towels moist. Spray the top towel with a spray bottle of water to keep them moist. Check the paper towels several times a day to ensure they do not dry out. [6] X Research source If the seeds become too dry, they could die and never germinate."

      "title": "Wait for the seeds to germinate.",
      "content": "Wait for the seeds to germinate . Viable cannabis seeds will usually open with 48 hours. You should see the roots start to appear within a few days, depending on the seed type. Once the tap roots are 1 ⁄ 4 to 1 ⁄ 2 inch (0.64 to 1.27 cm) long, the seeds are ready to be planted. [7] X Research source Be very careful with the seeds as they open. Avoid prodding, pulling, or touching the seeds, as you do not want to damage the roots. Any seeds that have not opened and grown roots within a few days should be discarded, as they are not viable."

      "title": "Fill small, 2 inches (5.1 cm) garden pots with potting soil.",
      "content": "Fill small, 2 inches (5.1 cm) garden pots with potting soil. Get plastic garden pots that are small enough to house the seeds. Look for garden pots at your local garden supply store or online. Use potting soil that is loose and airy. The potting soil should be moist to the touch. Fill the pots ¾ of the way with the soil. [8] X Research source As an alternative to soil, you can use starter cubes from your local nursery or online. Starter cubes are pre-cut growing pods made of composted bark. They contain a hole where you can place the cannabis seeds and grow them in good conditions. Basic starter cubes are inexpensive and easy to use. [9] X Research source"

Do not poke the hole too deep or too close to the surface of the soil. [10] X Research source If you make planting holes that are too shallow, the seed's roots will not have enough soil to grow well. If you make the planting holes too deep, the seed will have a difficult time sprouting."

The tap root is the long root that will grow out of one end of the seed. [11] X Research source Do not pull or tug at the seeds when you pick them up with tweezers. If they are stuck to the paper towel, wet the towel with water to make the seeds easier to pick up."

A closet or a basement are two good indoor spots for the plants to grow. [12] X Research source Maintain a growing temperature of 75 to 85 °F (24 to 29 °C) for the plants so they thrive."

Avoid pooling the soil with water, as this can lead to growth issues due to overwatering. [13] X Research source Stick to a regular watering schedule so the plants get enough moisture. You can plan to spray the plants in the morning and then again at night so they get the water they need."

Keep the lights 2 inches (5.1 cm) from the pots. Use 3 to 5 watts of light for each pot. [14] X Research source Grow lights range from $200 to $1,200 USD depending on the size and model. You can get cool white grow lights at your local hardware store or online."
