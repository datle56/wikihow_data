      "content": "Shuffle the cards and deal them out to each player. Begin with the player to your left and deal clockwise. Each player should end up with exactly 13 cards, yourself included. You can all agree on who gets to be first dealer, or decide randomly. Remove any jokers from the deck before dealing. When playing with strangers or in a tournament, one player shuffles, a second player cuts the cards, and a third player deals them out. This reduces opportunity for cheating and is a common standard for card games."

The suit of this card (hearts, spades, clubs, or diamonds) is the Trump Suit for this round and will always \"beat\" cards from the other suits. (Read on for more details.) [2] X Research source This card is part of the dealer's hand. Make sure everyone gets a chance to look at it before the dealer picks it up with the rest of his hand. If the last card dealt doesn't end up in front of the dealer, everyone should count their hand and make sure they have 13 cards exactly. Remember, always deal hands beginning with the player on the dealer's left and moving clockwise. This is the only card revealed. All others are hidden in their owner's hand until played."

[4] X Research source If a player has any card in hand with the same suit as the original card, he must put a card down of that suit. If he has no cards of the original suit, he may play any card from his hand. If more than one suit is face up on the table, only the original suit led restricts what cards someone can play. For example, player A leads with a 10 of Clubs . Player B chooses from the Clubs in her hand and puts down a King of Clubs . Player C doesn't have a single Club, so he chooses from any card in his hand and puts down a 3 of Diamonds . Player D has the Jack of Clubs in hand as their only Club and must play it."

If there are no trump cards in the trick, whoever played the highest card of the suit led wins. Remember, the trump suit was determined by the revealed card earlier.
