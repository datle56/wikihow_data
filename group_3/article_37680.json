      "content": "Preheat the oven to 350 째F (177 째C) and spread Brazil nuts on a rimmed baking sheet. To make a big batch of toasted nuts, pour 3 cups (400 g) of shelled Brazil nuts onto a rimmed sheet. [1] X Research source Feel free to toast a smaller amount. If you'd like to roast even more Brazil nuts, divide the nuts between 2 baking sheets."

      "content": "Toss the nuts with oil, sweeteners, or spices, if you'd like. Although you can toast the nuts without anything else, drizzle them with 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of vegetable oil or melted butter for a richer flavor. To give the nuts a slightly sweet flavor, add 2 tablespoons (29.6 ml) (42 g) of honey or maple syrup. If you'd like a spicy taste, toss in 1 teaspoon (2 g) of ground cinnamon and 1/2 teaspoon (1 g) of mixed spice or cayenne pepper. [2] X Research source Once you've mixed the nuts with any of the optional seasonings, arrange the nuts so they're in a single layer."

      "content": "Put the sheet in the oven and toast the nuts for 8 to 10 minutes. Nuts don't take very long to roast, so it's important to stir them every few minutes so they don't burn in spots. Toast the nuts until you can smell them and they turn light brown. If you're not sure whether they're finished toasting, use tongs to remove a nut from the sheet. Carefully cut the nut in half to see if it's pale brown throughout. If it's not, toast the nuts for another minute and check them again."

      "title": "Transfer the roasted nuts to another sheet and cool them completely.",
      "content": "Transfer the roasted nuts to another sheet and cool them completely. Wear oven mitts to take the Brazil nuts out of the oven and immediately spoon them onto a clean rimmed baking sheet. Leave the nuts to cool before you store them or eat them. [3] X Research source If you leave the nuts on the hot baking sheet, they'll continue to cook from the residual heat. They'll also take longer to cool down. To store the Brazil nuts, put them in an airtight container. Keep them at room temperature for up to 1 week."

      "content": "Pour 1 cup (133 g) of Brazil nuts into a dry skillet. Set a large skillet on the stove and spread the nuts into the pan. Arrange them so they're in a single layer to help them cook evenly. Avoid tossing the nuts with oil or melted butter, since the nuts already contain oil and extra oil would cause the nuts to burn."

      "content": "Turn the burner to medium and begin shaking the skillet. Put on an oven mitt and hold the handle of the skillet. Gently shake the skillet back and forth so it's still coming into contact with the burner. Shaking moves around all of the nuts at once, but if you prefer, you could stir them constantly with a spoon or spatula."

      "content": "Cook the nuts for 2 to 4 minutes. Since the Brazil nuts toast much faster on the stove than in the oven, don't walk away from the skillet. Keep shaking the pan and turn off the burner once the nuts smell fragrant and turn pale brown. If you don't shake the pan or move the nuts, they'll burn or blister in spots."

If you don't want to toast a full cup, it's fine to use less. [5] X Research source If you'd like to roast more nuts, microwave them in batches instead of all at once. If you crowd the dish, the nuts steam instead of toast."

The total amount of time it takes to microwave the nuts depends on your appliance and the amount of nuts you're toasting."
