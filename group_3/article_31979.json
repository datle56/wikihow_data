      "title": "Back away from monitoring their activities.",
      "content": "Back away from monitoring their activities. It might be difficult to create space for your partner. If you’re used to going through your partner’s things or asking loads of questions when they go out, learn to cut back on these practices. While it can be scary, it shows that you’re willing to trust your partner and not over-involve yourself in their life. [1] X Research source Practice giving trust before suspicion. Give your partner trust first and see how it feels. Let your partner know you are choosing to trust them instead of being suspicious. Remember that if you're monitoring your partner, it means that you're already suspicious of them. You might misinterpret anything that you find."

      "title": "Talk openly with your partner.",
      "content": "Talk openly with your partner. Clearly talking things over with your partner can help you overcome trust issues. Being able to clearly communicate without feeling like either of you are hiding something can increase communication and build trust. If there are situations that worry you, state your concerns and why they bother you. [2] X Expert Source Kelli Miller, LCSW, MSW Relationship Counselor Expert Interview. 11 June 2020. Let your partner respond and hear them out. [3] X Research source For example, instead of worrying what your partner is doing when they go out, have a talk before they leave and get an idea for where they are going and what they are doing. Get in the habit of having these talks without pressing them for information. When talking to your partner, be calm and friendly. If you accuse or blame them of things, they may become defensive. If you appear mad or upset, they may not want to talk."

      "title": "Keep from blaming each other.",
      "content": "Keep from blaming each other. Blame only makes things worse when trust is shaky. If your partner feels mistrust in you or you trust your partner less, be cautious to not blame them. Instead, be receptive to what they say and hear them out. Ask questions instead of making accusations. [4] X Research source There will be times when you think something is fishy. On such occasions, it's worth changing your approach and finding out more details. For example, if worried about your partner’s secretive texting, say, “I find it odd that you’re so secretive when you text. Can you tell me what’s up?” This works better than, “I don’t trust you and think you’re hiding something from me.”"
