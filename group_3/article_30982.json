      "content": "Mix equal parts of brown and yellow to make a goldenrod shade. Winter says, “In general, the color of gold consists of some brown paint…burnt sienna or burnt umber [mixed with] yellow ochre or raw sienna, and white.” If you have a tube of brown paint on hand, this is the easiest way to make gold. Simply stir together equal parts of the yellow and brown oil or acrylic paint to make a more traditional mustard-colored gold. For more shades, add different colors to the mix. If the color looks beige or bland, try adding a drop of red and a drop of blue to bring out the undertones. Add 1 part pink to 2 parts gold to make rose gold or 2 parts brown to 1 part yellow to make bronze gold."

Then, mix together an equal amount of the green shade and red to make brown . Finally, mix an equal amount of brown and yellow to make a brown-based gold. For a brighter gold, continue adding yellow until you reach the desired shade. [1] X Research source If you make the shade too yellow-toned, add a drop of blue and a drop of red to balance it out with purple tones. For a more brown-toned shade, add more red than blue to the original mixture. Winters says, “Metals reflect the surrounding colors. For instance, if a golden candle holder is placed next to a red wallpaper, the gold will have some red mixed into it. Also, the warm and cool light affects color perception, and more colors could be added to the basic mix. Finally, gold in the shadow would look dark and less ‘golden’ than the one in the light.” She recommends adding colors, like cadmium yellows or reds, depending on the reflections in your piece."

Add a drop of black to the orange. Then, add a drop of yellow to the mixture to make it lighter and brighter. This creates a shade that closely resembles true gold. [2] X Research source For more warmth, mix in a drop of red, magenta, brown, or orange, depending on your desired color. To make a cooler shade, add a drop of light blue."

Adding red will make the gold warmer, and blue will give it a cooler tone. Yellow will help to even out colors that are too warm or cool, and white will make the colors lighter. [3] X Research source Winter says, “Gold in the shadow would look dark and less \"golden\" than the one in the light, which prompts different color mixing for light and shadow.”"

      "content": "Add a few drops of white to make the glitter or pigment shine. When you make a sparkly or metallic shade, the shine will be more pronounced on a lighter color. Mixing white with any color makes it lighter. Add 2-3 drops of white into the gold that you mixed, and stir it after each drop—but don’t overdo it. White also dulls a paint color if you use too much. [4] X Research source Once you’ve reached a color that’s 1-2 shades lighter than your original color, add gold glitter or pigment. If you’re happy with the shade, you don’t have to make it lighter. Most glitter and metallic shades tend to dry brighter than they look when they’re applied."

Get a container of gold or translucent craft glitter or micro-glitter from the craft store, and mix a pinch of the glitter into the paint. Use a brush to paint a swatch of the gold and let it dry. Then, hold the swatch under direct light to view the glitter. [6] X Research source Use more glitter for larger amounts of paint. Swatch after adding more glitter to see if the amount of glitter is to your liking. Keep in mind that large pieces of glitter will be less effective since the paint will coat the flecks of plastic. Try to purchase the smallest glitter available to get a sparkly, shiny effect. This is a great option for painting walls and furniture because the glitter will be visible from all angles."

Then, use your hands or a brush to stick gold glitter onto the wet paint for a 3D effect. Let the paint dry and apply a sealant or clear varnish to ensure that the glitter doesn’t fall off. [7] X Research source This is a great idea for crafts or paintings because it allows you to apply the glitter anywhere."

      "content": "Bring gold to your art with other art supplies, like gold leaf. For an even stronger pop of gold, consider choosing a pre-mixed commercial gold metallic paint . This is an especially good option for an authentic metallic-looking sheen for your art. While it’s possible to add shimmer to the gold paint you mixed, the effect is often more even when you purchase it. A few other options for adding a glint of gold to your work are: Gold leaf: Gold leaf is an extremely thin sheet of gold that artists and artisans use to gild manuscripts, ornamental designs, art, and even food. However, gold leaf is a little tricky to work with. Squares of gold leaf are so thin and delicate that they move with a light breath. [8] X Research source Gilding wax: Gilding wax is a mixture of beeswax and metallic pigments. Artists and craftsmen use it to add a metallic finish to their work. Most commonly, gilding wax is used to embellish wood carvings, but it looks great on any textured surface. [9] X Research source Gold paint pens: Gold paint pens are filled with metallic ink, oil paint, or pigments. They’re incredibly handy for adding gold to finely detailed work."
