      "content": "Dry your razor completely. You can remove much of the excess moisture from your razor by holding it firmly and shaking it into the basin of your sink. Then, to ensure the blade is completely dry, you should use a cloth to wipe away remaining moisture. Do this by running your razor along the cloth with a motion that follows the direction of the blades. To prevent fuzz or lint from building up, you might consider using a lint-free or microfiber cloth to dry your razor. [5] X Research source Store your razor in a dry spot, like a case or drawer, instead of leaving it in the sink shower, or bathroom, where it's exposed to moisture and likely to rust."

      "content": "Run your razor along your jeans. You'll want to do this with the direction of the blades and not against the blades. Do this about approximately 20 times in one direction with short, quick strokes. This process, called stropping, will remove burrs and irregularities from your blades, honing your razor's edge. To evenly and completely strop your blades, you'll want perform the same motion in the opposite direction (on the same section of denim) as well. Switch directions and run the blade along the jean fabric around 20 times in the same fashion you did previously. Use light pressure when stropping. Pressing too hard can actually cause damage to the edge of your blade."

      "content": "Run your razor along your forearm for jeans-less stropping. Be careful while doing this; you don't want to cut yourself while sharpening! Use moderate pressure and run the blades of your razor along the straight part of the top of your forearm with the direction of the blades and not against . Use quick, short strokes, and perform this motion about 10 - 15 times. Your arm is very similar to an old fashioned leather strop, which is a piece of leather used for sharpening blades. In the same way a strop sharpens a blade, so should your arm. Since you are running your razor with the blades and not against , your safety razor shouldn't cut the hair on your forearm. Be careful not to slip and run the blade side-to-side, as this could result in you cutting yourself."

With the same motion you used for your first stropping, run your blades along the jeans with and not against the direction of the blades. Use light pressure and short, quick strokes for roughly 20 strokes, running your razor back and forth along the jeans, always in the same direction of the blades. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Clean your razor after shaving. Your skin has natural oils that protect it from the environment, but these oils can also harm the quality of your blade over time. Shaving cream and decaying hair can also lead to your razor dulling rapidly. Clean your razor thoroughly after each use to maintain the sharpness of your blades. Use hot water and soap to clean your razor. A good way to remove gunk and grime thoroughly is to use a toothbrush to lightly scrub your razor when you are finished shaving.

      "content": "Dry your razor always after using it. When your razor is wet, the metal is vulnerable to corrosion and rust. This will cause your razor to dull more quickly. Thoroughly dry your razor when you are done shaving to prevent this. Then, store it in a cabinet, drawer, or case instead of the sink, shower, or counter where it will be exposed to moisture. Many approaches can work for drying your razor. For example, you might use a blow dryer or blot your blades with a towel. Always exercise care when drying your blades. Rushing while blotting your blades with a towel might cause you to accidentally run your fingers along the sharp part of the blade, which could cut you. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Consider using a skin safe blade lubricant. You might consider using a mineral oil or a small amount of cooking oil on your blade after drying it. This will coat the outer surface of the blade, making it less susceptible to moisture in the air, airborne dirt, and other environmental factors that can lead to a dull razor. Some companies offer special formulated oils designed to prolong the life of your blade. Search for these in the shaving section of your local pharmacy, or online through a shaving vendor.
