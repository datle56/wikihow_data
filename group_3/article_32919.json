      "title": "Find an area that provides 6 or more hours of direct sunlight daily.",
      "content": "Find an area that provides 6 or more hours of direct sunlight daily. Anything less is not considered full sunlight. Keep in mind that the 6 hours of sunlight does not have to be continuous. Partial sunlight is 4 to 6 hours and — although it probably won't kill the tree — is not ideal. Shade can decrease your tree's vigor, which can lead to thinning and heightened disease susceptibility. Full sunlight isn't as important in the tree's later years, as mature trees will usually grow tall enough to avoid being shaded by other plants and trees."

      "content": "Check soil pH using your pH tester. Leyland Cypress can grow in various soil types, although optimal pH is between 5.0 to 8.0. If your pH is outside of this range, you can add limestone, sulfur, or aluminum sulfate to adjust it . For low-magnesium soils, use dolomitic limestone to raise pH. If your soil is high in magnesium, use calcitic limestone to raise its pH. [2] X Research source Regular sulfur additions can gradually decrease pH over time, although its effectiveness depends on temperature, moisture, and bacterial presence. Aluminum sulfate additions can decrease pH instantly. However, this immediate action can make it difficult to control the extent of the pH reduction. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Dig a hole and fill it with water to test soil drainage. Leyland Cypress should be planted in a well-drained location. [4] X Research source To test soil drainage, dig a hole 12 to 18 inches (30 to 46 cm) across and deep. Fill it with water and see how long it takes to drain. Anything 1 hour or more indicates poor soil drainage. The addition of organic matter such as manure, peat moss, or compost, can improve soil drainage."

      "title": "Divide your desired height by 4 if you're creating a staggered row.",
      "content": "Divide your desired height by 4 if you're creating a staggered row. Many people use Leyland Cypress trees to create screens or hedges. In this case, decide on the height of the screen and divide it by 4. For example, a row of trees 20 feet (6.1 m) high, keep each tree approximately 5 feet (1.5 m) apart. [5] X Research source If your trees are too close, weaker trees will become smothered by the larger ones."

      "content": "Plant Leyland Cypress trees when they are dormant. The best time to plant Leyland Cypress trees is in fall when they are dormant. Around 6 weeks prior to the first frost, usually mid-fall, is the best time to plant. Although this is not essential, it will increase the tree's chances of survival. [6] X Research source Planting trees outside of the dormancy period can place them under unnecessary stress. Particularly in the spring, when providing them with the amount of water necessary for growth is difficult."

Carefully slide your tree from the container, taking care to keep the soil around the roots intact and prevent the separation of roots from the tree.

You can use a trowel or knife to loosen the soil around the weeds and cut into their roots to prevent them from growing back. Place your grass and weeds into a bucket to prevent them from spreading seeds. Sprinkling salt onto the bottom of weed plants can help kill them over time."

This will ensure that your plant's roots have enough space to spread out. Adding organic matter like peat moss, compost, or leaf mold can help loosen the soil. Improper root growth is one of the main causes of Leyland Cypress death. [9] X Research source"

      "content": "Apply starter fertilizer at the time of planting. Giving your freshly planted tree fertilizer is a great boost. Afterwards, don't fertilize it until 3 months following planting. Fertilizing earlier will promote the growth of the top at the expense of root system growth. [10] X Research source Use an 8, 9, 12, or 14-month slow-release fertilizer. Avoid fertilizers high in nitrogen until the tree has developed a proper root system that can support increased top growth.

Use your best judgment—if the soil is becoming soggy, decrease the amount of water you use. [12] X Research source Leyland Cypress' need adequate water—even during the fall, their evergreen foliage typically lose water. Water regularly for the 2 to 3 months following planting.

Adult females do not have legs or wings, are yellow in color, and have an appearance akin to a maggot. Bags should either be destroyed or placed into a 5 gallons (19 L) container. This allows any helpful parasites to escape the bags while keeping bagworm larvae contained. Pests can also be treated with a mild insecticidal soap or spray."
