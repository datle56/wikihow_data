However, instead of playing against the other players at the table, everyone is playing against the dealer's hand. Before you play Pai Gow Poker, you need to familiarize yourself with the basic 5-card poker hands. [1] X Research source Royal flush: Ace, King, Queen, Jack, and a 10 of the same suit. Straight flush: 5 consecutive cards of the same suit like ace, 3, 4, 5, and 6 of clubs. 4 of a kind: 4 of the same cards, but different suits.

For your 2-card hand, the best you can get is a pair. [2] X Research source Not every one of the 5 cards needs to be a part of your hand. For example, if you have 3 of a kind, the remaining 2 cards can simply form the rest of your 5-card hand."
