The lower the game speed, the longer it will take to finish. Online is the quickest, taking half the speed of a normal game to finish, and marathon being the longest, being twice as long as a normal game.

Your immediate goal at this point should be to scout the nearby area and find a good place to found your first city. While different cities have different priorities and start biases, here are some things you should consider before settling your first city: Fresh water - One of the most important factors, access to fresh water provides a boost to your city's growth, by providing extra housing for citizens. Having more housing means more space for citizens, and ultimately a more productive city overall. [3] X Research source Sources of fresh water include rivers, lakes, and oases. Coast - Settling a city on the coast will boost your progress towards the sailing tech, and also allow for the production of naval units that can be crucial to early game exploration and warfare. Settling on the coast also provides extra housing if the city does not have any access to fresh water. Yields - Another thing crucial to the productivity of your city is ensuring that all nearby tiles provide adequate yield. The yield of a tile refers to the amount of food, gold, productivity, and science they provide when worked by a citizen. Hilly Grasslands, Plains, and Floodplains provide some of the best base yield, whereas Snow and Desert tiles provide no yield at all. [4] X Research source Try to settle your city next to tiles with good yields. Resources - Having access to good resources will provide bonus yield and amenities (a resource necessary to ensure the prosperity of your cities) when improved by a builder. Strategic resources will also let you build powerful units to dominate the early game."

Reconnoitering the nearby area will let you find other civilizations, meet city-states before other players to claim a bonus envoy, find tribal villages for special boosts, reveal barbarian camps, and find potential spots for new cities. Try to scout out as much of the area as possible. You can use your warrior to explore the map in the earliest stages of the game, but it is a good idea to build a few scouts as soon as possible and explore."

Aiming for a specific victory type and focusing your efforts on that goal can help you win the game. The victory conditions are as follows: Domination Victory - The domination victory is the most straightforward victory type. To win a domination victory, you must capture the original capital of every other civilization in the game. In order to do this, you must have a powerful military. Science Victory - A science victory is won by achieving certain milestones. To win a science victory you must launch an earth satellite, land a human on the moon, establish a martian colony, launch an exoplanet expedition, and finally, land on the exoplanet. To win a science victory, it is essential to generate a large amount of science from your empire's scientific districts and buildings. Culture Victory - To win a culture victory, you must attract a lot of tourists from other civilizations by awing them with your cultural splendor. In order to do this, you must generate a lot of culture and tourism through great works, buildings, and policies. Religious Victory - Win a religious victory by converting all other civilizations to your religion. It is essential that your religion be the dominant one in every civilization, so build a lot of missionaries and apostles, and generate as much faith as you can. Diplomatic Victory - A diplomatic victory is won by earning a certain amount of diplomatic victory points (the exact number depends on the game speed), which can be earned through events, wonders, wars, and the world congress. Score Victory - If no other victory condition is met in time, the player with the highest score will win a score victory. Try to reach your victory condition as fast as possible, as a score victory is boring and not something you should be aiming for."

The more science your civilization generates, the faster it progresses. Regardless of which victory condition you are pursuing, being ahead of your opponents in technologies is very important. Begin with a basic technology like pottery or mining, and slowly progress through the tech tree, focusing on the technologies that are important to you. Some are more important than others, like the ones that unlock scientific buildings if you're going for a science victory, or new military technologies if you're going for a domination victory."

There are four different kinds of social policies that you can enact, and these all affect a different aspect of gameplay. The number of policies you can enact at one time is affected by your government, which you can improve later. You can also gain more slots by building wonders. You gain more policy cards are you progress along the civics tree. The policies you can enact include: Military policies - These policies enhance your military, from small bonuses like an increase in combat strength versus barbarians, to huge ones like an increase in experience gain for all units. Economic policies - Economic policies increase can increase production, gold gain, housing, and amenities. Diplomatic policies - Diplomatic policies mainly focus on gaining envoys to city-states as well as diplomatic favor. Enacting the right diplomatic policies goes a long way towards winning a diplomatic victory. Wildcard policies - Wildcard policies mainly grant bonuses to great people generation, which can be useful for all victory types. Unlike other policies, any policy card can be added to a wildcard policy slot, making it highly versatile."

You gain some envoys automatically, but can gain additional ones by being the first to meet a city-state, completing quests for a city-state, or researching some civics and policies."

Produce or buy a trader, and then issue the necessary order to begin a trade route between cities. Maximise the efficiency of your trade routes by sending them to the cities they gain the most gold out of. These will be the most developed ones, or the ones you have an economic alliance with. Trade routes, like most other mechanics, can be boosted through wonders and social policies. The amount of trade routes you can have also varies through the game as you progress in civics and technology. Add additional trade routes whenever you can."

You can then make a dedication to focus on a certain aspect of progress through the next era. Depending on your era score, the bonuses differ. Your civilization will be more loyal and productive, and will be given a greater boost to progress, if you earned a golden age the previous era. On the other hand, if you fail to gather enough era score, your civilization will enter a dark age. All your cities will be less loyal and your empire will be harder to manage. Try not to fall behind, and aim to hit a golden age whenever possible."

Each governor specializes in a certain area, like science, faith, gold, production, etc. Once you have earned a governor title, appoint a governor and assign it to a city.

If one of your units stumbles upon a natural wonder, try to settle a city next to it as soon as possible.

Once a unit gains enough experience points, you can promote it to heal it by 50 health points, and make it stronger in future battle.

Once you have enough Great People Points, the game will prompt you to recruit a great person. Each great person provides a specific bonus, and if that bonus is useful to you, you can click the Recruit button to recruit the great person to your civilization. Great People may then be expended to provide a boost, or, in the case of Great Generals and Great Admirals, be sent along with your military to boost its strength. Managing your great people correctly is key to winning a game of Civilization."

As you continue to progress through the civics tree, you will unlock new forms of government that can house more policy cards and provide powerful effects. Whenever you unlock a new government, consider if you want to switch to it. Each government features a different policy structure, some favoring certain victory types over others. Fascism can house many more military policies than democracy, and as such may be good government to consider if you're going for a domination victory. On the other hand, it has very little slots for economic policies, so picking it if you're going for other victories can cripple you. Choose the right government for your civilization and you will be on your way to victory."

      "content": "Found and spread your religion. What a pantheon is to the early game, a religion is to the mid and end game. Founding and spreading a religion is especially important if you're aiming for a religious victory, but can be useful otherwise as well. You can found and enhance your religion through Great Prophets, which can be earned by great people points, or through a wonder like the Stonehenge. Sharing a religion with another civilization can increase the information you receive about that civilization, and give you other benefits. Spread your religion using missionaries or apostles, by wiping out other religions and replacing it with your own."

      "title": "Trade with other civilizations.",
      "content": "Trade with other civilizations. Apart from trade routes, another way to further your goals is by trading with other civilizations. When both of you have something the other wants, one civilization can offer the other a trade deal. If it is mutually agreeable, both civilizations gain what was promised. You can do a whole lot more with a trade deal than you can with a trade route. While a trade route is a fairly straightforward one-sided action, a trade deal needs to be agreeable to both parties. By proposing good trade deals, you can greatly advance your civilization. Some things you can do with a trade deal include: Gold - The most basic trade, you can trade some amount of gold per turn or make a one-time payment to another civilization Great works - Two civilizations can agree to trade great works, or trade one for something else. This is useful if either one of the civilizations is aiming for a culture victory, and the other is aiming for something else. Just be careful not to give your opponent enough to reach their win condition before you! Joint wars - Once you have formed an alliance with a declared friend, you automatically form a defensive pact with them. In addition to this, you can declare joint wars through trade deals. Research agreements - Through a research agreement, two civs can agree to jointly research and share a certain technology that they both need to gain it much faster. Strategic and luxury resources - Strategic and bonus resources can be traded to maximize their output. As you don't gain extra amenities for duplicate copies of a resource, you can trade any extra resources for new ones from other civilizations to keep your citizens happy. Cities - The ultimate trade deal, trading cities can be done as part of a peace treaty or if you just want to help an ally out."

Peaceful civilizations without strong standing armies are easy targets for warmongers seeking a domination victory, and you will often be attacked and destroyed if you fail to keep up. You do not need to attack other civilizations with your military, but maintaining a standing army will allow your civilization to defend against attackers and stay in the game to reach whatever victory condition you are chasing."

      "content": "Weather natural disasters. As you build your empire, you will be struck by natural disasters depending on the game's disaster intensity. Tornadoes, floods, volcanic eruptions, droughts, dust storms, and other disasters can wreak havoc on your civilization. Take precautionary measures in areas that are disaster-prone to avoid falling prey to a natural disaster. For instance, if your civilization is on the banks of a river that is prone to flooding, build the great bath or a flood barrier. If tornadoes seem to strike your city often, hire the surveyor and use her reinforced materials ability to disaster-proof your city. In spite of all these measures though, you will undoubtedly be affected by a natural disaster sometime, so repair the damage with a builder(or your city if a district is damaged) as soon as you can to avoid falling behind."

This is easier if you have a casus belli (a cause to go to war), but even a surprise war can be useful to prevent an opponent from winning the game, or to win a domination victory. Note that once you declare war, you cannot make peace for some time, so weigh your decision carefully. Also keep in mind that all city-states you are the suzerain of also go to war with the enemy, and the same goes for your opponent."

If you are far ahead of another civilization in military might, but don't want to declare war and incur the world's wrath, but still want something from them anyway, move the full might of your military(this includes any naval and air units) next to their empire and make a demand of them. If your military is powerful enough, they will have to concede to your demand. The more powerful you are, the more you can demand.

For example, if you're aiming for a science victory, all your production should go towards scientific projects. Unnecessary actions in the end game can lead to an opponent hitting their win condition before you. Keep a watchful eye and carefully monitor how close your opponents are to the victories they are aiming for, and plan your actions accordingly.

The World Congress lets you sabotage players who are close to their win conditions, by restricting their military production, great people generation, stripping them of their diplomatic victory points, stopping their tourism, and condemning their religion. The World Congress can also greatly aid you in achieving your goals, by passing resolutions that are favorable to the type of victory you are trying to achieve. For example, if you're aiming for a culture victory, try to pass a resolution to double your tourism."

Turning a blind eye to climate change can crush your civilization as it sinks under rising sea levels, so be careful to watch how emissions are affecting the earth. Climate change can also be used as a weapon against your opponents. If a winning civilization has most of their cities at low elevations, it might even be worth it to try and trigger climate change, as long as your civilization is protected. On the other hand, if your civilization is at a low elevation, it becomes imperative to keep your carbon footprint to an absolute minimum through the necessary city projects."
