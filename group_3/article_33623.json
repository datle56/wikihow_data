      "content": "“Remember” – Christina Rossetti Remember me when I am gone away,Gone far away into the silent land;When you can no more hold me by the hand,Nor I half turn to go yet turning stay.Remember me when no more day by dayYou tell me of our future that you planned:Only remember me; you understandIt will be late to counsel then or pray.Yet if you should forget me for a whileAnd afterwards remember, do not grieve:For if the darkness and corruption leaveA vestige of the thoughts that once I had,Better by far you should forget and smileThan that you should remember and be sad."

      "content": "“Holy Sonnets: Death, be not proud” – John Donne Death, be not proud, though some have called thee Mighty and dreadful, for thou art not so; For those whom thou think'st thou dost overthrow Die not, poor Death, nor yet canst thou kill me. From rest and sleep, which but thy pictures be, Much pleasure; then from thee much more must flow, And soonest our best men with thee do go, Rest of their bones, and soul's delivery. Thou art slave to fate, chance, kings, and desperate men, And dost with poison, war, and sickness dwell, And poppy or charms can make us sleep as well And better than thy stroke; why swell'st thou then? One short sleep past, we wake eternally And death shall be no more; Death, thou shalt die."

This be the verse you 'grave for me: Here he lies where he long'd to be; Home is the sailor, home from the sea, And the hunter home from the hill."

      "content": "“Nothing Gold Can Stay” – Robert Frost Nature’s first green is gold, Her hardest hue to hold. Her early leaf’s a flower; But only so an hour. Then leaf subsides to leaf. So Eden sank to grief, So dawn goes down to day. Nothing gold can stay."

      "content": "“The Chariot” – Emily Dickinson Because I could not stop for Death, He kindly stopped for me; The carriage held but just ourselves And Immortality. We slowly drove, he knew no haste, And I had put away My labor, and my leisure too, For his civility. We passed the school where children played, Their lessons scarcely done; We passed the fields of gazing grain, We passed the setting sun. We paused before a house that seemed A swelling of the ground; The roof was scarcely visible, The cornice but a mound. Since then 't is centuries; but each Feels shorter than the day I first surmised the horses' heads Were toward eternity."

      "content": "“Condolence” – Dorothy Parker They hurried here, as soon as you had died, Their faces damp with haste and sympathy, And pressed my hand in theirs, and smoothed my knee, And clicked their tongues, and watched me, mournful-eyed. Gently they told me of that Other Side— How, even then, you waited there for me, And what ecstatic meeting ours would be. Moved by the lovely tale, they broke, and cried. And when I smiled, they told me I was brave, And they rejoiced that I was comforted, And left, to tell of all the help they gave. But I had smiled to think how you, the dead, So curiously preoccupied and grave, Would laugh, could you have heard the things they said."

      "content": "“The Dark Cavalier” – Margaret Widdemer I am the Dark Cavalier; I am the Last Lover: My arms shall welcome you when other arms are tired; I stand to wait for you, patient in the darkness, Offering forgetfulness of all that you desired. I ask no merriment, no pretense of gladness, I can love heavy lids and lips without their rose; Though you are sorrowful you will not weary me; I will not go from you when all the tired world goes. I am the Dark Cavalier; I am the Last Lover; I promise faithfulness no other lips may keep; Safe in my bridal place, comforted by darkness, You shall lie happily, smiling in your sleep."

      "content": "“Challenge” – Sterling A. Brown I said, in drunken pride of youth and you That mischief-making Time would never dare Play his ill-humored tricks upon us two, Strange and defiant lovers that we were. I said that even Death, Highwayman Death, Could never master lovers such as we, That even when his clutch had throttled breath, My hymns would float in praise, undauntedly. I did not think such words were bravado. Oh, I think honestly we knew no fear, We loved each other so. And thus, with you believing me, I made My prophecies, rebellious, unafraid . . . . And that was foolish, wasn’t it, my dear?"

      "content": "“Testament” – Dorothy Parker Oh, let it be a night of lyric rain And singing breezes, when my bell is tolled. I have so loved the rain that I would hold Last in my ears its friendly, dim refrain. I shall lie cool and quiet, who have lain Fevered, and watched the book of day unfold. Death will not see my flinch; the heart is bold That pain has made incapable of pain. Kinder the busy worms than ever love; It will be peace to lie there, empty-eyed, My bed made secret by the leveling showers, My breast replenishing the weeds above. And you will say of me, “Then has she died? Perhaps I should have sent a spray of flowers.”"

I wouldn’t want the same name every time and the same old house number always, dying a million deaths, dying one by one a million times: —would you? or you? or you?"

      "content": "“I Shall Come Back” – Dorothy Parker I shall come back without fanfaronade Of wailing wind and graveyard panoply; But, trembling, slip from cool Eternity— A mild and most bewildered little shade. I shall not make sepulchral midnight raid, But softly come where I had longed to be In April twilight’s unsung melody, And I, not you, shall be the one afraid. Strange, that from lovely dreamings of the dead I shall come back to you, who hurt me most. You may not feel my hand upon your head, I’ll be so new and inexpert a ghost. Perhaps you will not know that I am near,— And that will break my ghostly heart, my dear."

      "content": "“Rose Song” – Anne Reeve Aldrich Plant, above my lifeless heart Crimson roses, red as blood. As if the love, pent there so long Were pouring forth its flood. Then, through them, my heart may tell, Its Past of Love and Grief, And I shall feel them grow from it, And know a vague relief. Through rotting shroud shall feel their roots, And unto them myself shall grow, And when I blossom at her feet, She, on that day, shall know!"

And let the choir sing a stormy song To drown the rattle of my dying breath. Beat the drums of tragedy for me, And let the white violins whir thin and slow, But blow one blaring trumpet note of sun To go with me to the darkness where I go."

Rose leaves, when the rose is dead, Are heaped for the belovèd's bed; And so thy thoughts, when thou art gone, Love itself shall slumber on."

      "content": "“Invocation” – Helene Johnson Let me be buried in the rain In a deep, dripping wood, Under the warm wet breast of Earth Where once a gnarled tree stood. And paint a picture on my tomb With dirt and a piece of bough Of a girl and a boy beneath a round, ripe moon Eating of love with an eager spoon And vowing an eager vow. And do not keep my plot mowed smooth And clean as a spinster’s bed, But let the weed, the flower, the tree, Riotous, rampant, wild and free, Grow high above my head."

I lost the hope of Spring, the joy of June, The Autumn’s peace, the Winter’s firelight. I lost the zest of living, the sweet sense Expectant of your step, your smile, your kiss; I lost all hope and fear and keen suspense For this cold calm, sans agony, sans bliss. I lost the rainbow’s gold, the silver key That gave me freedom of my town of dreams; I lost the path that leads to Faërie By beechen glades and heron-haunted streams. I lost the master word, dear love, the clue That threads the maze of life when I lost you."

      "title": "“The Shadow on the Stone” – Thomas Hardy",
      "content": "“The Shadow on the Stone” – Thomas Hardy I went by the Druid stone That stands in the garden white and lone, And I stopped and looked at the shifting shadows That at some moments there are thrown From the tree hard by with a rhythmic swing, And they shaped in my imagining To the shade that a well-known head and shoulders Threw there when she was gardening. I thought her behind my back, Yea, her I long had learned to lack, And I said: “I am sure you are standing behind me, Though how do you get into this old track?” And there was no sound but the fall of a leaf As a sad response; and to keep down grief I would not turn my head to discover That there was nothing in my belief. Yet I wanted to look and see That nobody stood at the back of me; But I thought once more: “Nay, I’ll not unvision A shape which, somehow, there may be.” So I went on softly from the glade, And left her behind me throwing her shade, As she were indeed an apparition— My head unturned lest my dream should fade."

      "content": "“To Jake” – Eunice Tietjens You are turned wraith. Your supple, flitting hands, As formless as the night wind’s moan, Beckon across the years, and your heart’s pain Fades surely as a stainèd stone. And yet you will not let me rest, crying And calling down the night to me A thing that when your body moved and glowed, Living, you could not make me see. Lean down your homely, mist-encircled head Close, close above my human ear, And tell me what of pain among the dead— Tell me, and I will try to hear."

      "content": "“After” – Leonora Speyer I will not walk in the wood to-night, I will not stand by the water’s edge And see day lie on the dusk’s bright ledge Until it turn, a star at its breast, To rest. I will not see the wide-flung hills Closing darkly about my grief, I wore a crown of their lightest leaf, But now they press like a cold, blue ring, Imprisoning. I dare not meet that caroling blade, Jauntily drawn in the sunset pine, Stabbing me with its thrust divine, Knowing my naked, aching need, Till I bleed. Sheathe your song, invincible bird, Strike not at me with that flashing note, Have pity, have pity, persistent throat, Deliver me not to your dread delight To-night! I am afraid of the creeping wood, I am afraid of the furtive trees, Hiding behind them, memories, Ready to spring, to clutch, to tear, Wait for me there."

      "content": "“Out of the Rolling Ocean the Crowd” – Walt Whitman Out of the rolling ocean, the crowd, came a drop gently to me, Whispering I love you, before long I die, I have travel'd a long way, merely to look on you to touch you, For I could not die till I once look'd on you, For I fear'd I might afterward lose you. Now we have met, we have look'd, we are safe, Return in peace to the ocean my love, I too am part of that ocean, my love, we are not so much separated, Behold the great rondure, the cohesion of all, how perfect! But as for me, for you, the irresistible sea is to separate us, As for an hour carrying us diverse, yet cannot carry us diverse forever; Be not impatient—a little space—know you I salute the air, the ocean and the land, Every day at sundown for your dear sake my love."

      "content": "“After great pain a formal feeling comes — (175)” – Emily Dickinson After great pain a formal feeling comes — The nerves sit ceremonious like tombs; The stiff Heart questions — was it He that bore? And yesterday — or centuries before? The feet mechanical go round A wooden way Of ground or air or Ought, Regardless grown, A quartz contentment like a stone. This is the hour of lead Remembered if outlived As freezing persons recollect The snow — First chill, then stupor, then The letting go."

No bien se acaba una Ya tengo otra. LV Like two trees we are By fate separated. The road is between But the boughs are mated. Como dos árboles somos Que la suerte nos separa, Con un camino por medio, Pero se juntan las ramas. CII I see myself as a crow. All are wearing clothes of gladness, Clothed in black mourning I go. Me comparo con el cuervo. Todos visten de alegría, Yo visto de luto negro."

Do you not know That I have conquered pain, Have parted from my woe? That my proud feet have found their path again, After the pathless heights-long after- And that my hands have learned to bless Their overflowing emptiness, My lips grown reconciled to laughter? O laggard of dead roads, O heart that will not heal nor break Nor yet forget! Tell me, whose tears are these That greet me as I wake? Why is my pillow wet? Red rebel, is it you That lifted this wild dew Like banners from my arid dreams, That roused this ember From exiled ashes, Calling me to remember? Speak, is it you that wept Upon my pillow while I slept? Does the heart then grieve on, After its grief is gone, A treasure ship that journeys Across its own oblivion?"

O earth, I hear thee mourning for thy dead! Thou art waving the long grass over thy graves; Murmuring over all thy resting children, That have run and wandered and gone down Upon thy bosom. Thou wilt mourn for him Who looketh now a moment on these stars, And in the moving boughs of this dark night Heareth the murmurous sorrow of thy heart."

These are the units to measure the worth Of a person as a person, regardless of birth. Not, what was their church, nor what was their creed? But had they befriended those really in need? Were they ever ready, with a word of good cheer, To bring back a smile, to banish a tear? Not, what did the sketch in the newspaper say, But how many were sorry when they passed away?"

We say he is gone; we have lost him forever; His face and his form we will cherish no more; While happy and safe, just over the river, He is waiting for us, where partings are o’er. Ah, sad are our hearts, as we gaze on him sleeping, And bitter and sad are the tears gushing down; And yet,— but we cannot see, for the weeping,— He has only exchanged the cross, for the crown. And though the dark mists of grief may surround us, Obscuring the face of the Father above, And blindly we grope, still His arms are around us, To guide and sustain with His pitying love. And he whom we love, is safe in His keeping, Yes, safe and secure, whatever may come; But ne’er will we know how sweetly he’s sleeping. Till God, in His mercy, shall gather us home."

And may there be no moaning of the bar, When I put out to sea, But such a tide as moving seems asleep, Too full for sound and foam, When that which drew from out the boundless deep Turns again home. Twilight and evening bell, And after that the dark! And may there be no sadness of farewell, When I embark; For tho’ from out our bourne of Time and Place The flood may bear me far, I hope to see my Pilot face to face When I have cross’d the bar."

With a cheery smile, and a wave of the hand He has wandered into an unknown land, And left us dreaming how very fair It needs must be, since he lingers there. And you - O you, who the wildest yearn For the old-time step and the glad return, Think of him faring on, as dear In the love of There as the love of Here; And loyal still, as he gave the blows Of his warrior-strength to his country's foes. Mild and gentle, as he was brave, When the sweetest love of his life he gave To simple things: Where the violets grew Blue as the eyes they were likened to, The touches of his hands have strayed As reverently as his lips have prayed: When the little brown thrush that harshly chirred Was dear to him as the mocking-bird; And he pitied as much as a man in pain A writhing honey-bee wet with rain. Think of him still as the same, I say: He is not dead - he is just away!"

When I die my star shall drop Singing like a nightingale; When I die my soul shall rise Where the lyre-strings never fail; In the rose my blood shall lie, In the violet the smile, And the moonbeams thousand strong Past my grave each night shall file."

Everything remains exactly as it was. I am I, and you are you, and the old life that we lived so fondly together is untouched, unchanged. Whatever we were to each other, that we are still. Call me by the old familiar name. Speak of me in the easy way which you always used. Put no difference into your tone. Wear no forced air of solemnity or sorrow. Laugh as we always laughed at the little jokes that we enjoyed together. Play, smile, think of me, pray for me. Let my name be ever the household word that it always was. Let it be spoken without an effort, without the ghost of a shadow upon it. Life means all that it ever meant. It is the same as it ever was. There is absolute and unbroken continuity. What is this death but a negligible accident? Why should I be out of mind because I am out of sight? I am but waiting for you, for an interval, somewhere very near, just round the corner. All is well. Nothing is hurt; nothing is lost. One brief moment and all will be as it was before. How we shall laugh at the trouble of parting when we meet again!"

      "content": "“Consolation” – Robert Louis Stevenson Though he, that ever kind and true, Kept stoutly step by step with you, Your whole long, gusty lifetime through, Be gone a while before, Be now a moment gone before, Yet, doubt not, soon the seasons shall restore Your friend to you. He has but turned the corner — still He pushes on with right good will, Through mire and marsh, by heugh and hill, That self-same arduous way — That self-same upland, hopeful way, That you and he through many a doubtful day Attempted still. He is not dead, this friend — not dead, But in the path we mortals tread Got some few, trifling steps ahead And nearer to the end; So that you too, once past the bend, Shall meet again, as face to face, this friend You fancy dead. Push gaily on, strong heart! The while You travel forward mile by mile, He loiters with a backward smile Till you can overtake, And strains his eyes to search his wake, Or whistling, as he sees you through the brake, Waits on a stile."

But the green is hiding your curls, my dear, Your curls so shining and sweet; And the gold-hearted daisies this many a year Have bloomed and bloomed at your feet, And the little birds just above your head With their voices hushed, my dear, For you have sung and have prayed and have pled This many, many a year. And the blossoms fall, On the garden wall, And drift like snow on the green below. But the sharp thorn grows On the budding rose, And my heart no more leaps at the sunset glow.

O Captain! my Captain! rise up and hear the bells; Rise up- for you the flag is flung- for you the bugle trills, For you bouquets and ribbon’d wreaths- for you the shores a-crowding, For you they call, the swaying mass, their eager faces turning; Here Captain! dear father! This arm beneath your head! It is some dream that on the deck ,You’ve fallen cold and dead. My Captain does not answer, his lips are pale and still, My father does not feel my arm, he has no pulse nor will, The ship is anchor’d safe and sound, its voyage closed and done, From fearful trip the victor ship comes in with object won; Exult O shores, and ring O bells!

But scarcely had we reached the distant place, When o'er the hills we heard a faint bell ringing; A boy came running up with frightened face; We knew the fatal news that he was bringing. I heard him listlessly, without a moan, Although the only one I loved was gone. II The dawn departs, the morning is begun, The trades come whispering from off the seas, The fields of corn are golden in the sun, The dark-brown tassels fluttering in the breeze; The bell is sounding and the children pass, Frog-leaping, skipping, shouting, laughing shrill, Down the red road, over the pasture-grass, Up to the school-house crumbling on the hill. The older folk are at their peaceful toil, Some pulling up the weeds, some plucking corn, And others breaking up the sun-baked soil. Float, faintly-scented breeze, at early morn Over the earth where mortals sow and reap— Beneath its breast my mother lies asleep."
