      "content": "Embrace your inner Rapunzel with a bohemian braid. The secret to getting an ethereal braid is to combine subtle accent curls and multiple braids together into one braid. Add fake flowers for a special touch. This look works best for those with long hair, although you can have a professional add hair extensions if you’d like to try this look and don’t have the length. Divide the hair into a top section (all the hair above the ears), a middle section (most of the remaining hair) and a bottom section (the hair above the nape of your neck). Loosely curl the bottom and middle sections with your curling iron. [8] X Research source Use tiny hair elastics to create a pull-through braid with the curled hair. Secure it halfway through with another hair elastic before repeating the pull-through braid. [9] X Research source Release the top section. Curl it loosely. Create two small braids along either side of your head, starting from the hairline and going back above the ear. Join them above the first braid you made. Use bobby pins to combine the two braids. [10] X Research source Place real or fake flowers down the center of the braid for a whimsical, bohemian touch. “Baby’s breath is a really easy, affordable option” for a floral hair look, says wedding planner Nine Morrison."

      "content": "Show off your carefree sense of style with a fishtail braid. Begin by straightening your hair so it’s sleek. Gather your hair to one side. Do a loose fishtail braid , pulling on strands as you go to volumize the braid. Secure with a clear hair elastic. Finally, pin your tiara atop your head using bobby pins. Insert the pins downward along the sides of the tiara to keep it in place. To do a fishtail braid, professional hair stylist Sarah Kosakowski says to split your hair into two equal sections. Take a small piece of hair from the outermost part of the right section, move it over the top of the hair, and add it to the left section. Repeat on the other side: take a small piece of hair from the outside of the left section and move it over the top of the hair, joining it with the right section. Keep moving strands back and forth until your fishtail braid is complete. Smaller strands will make the braid appear more detailed, while larger ones create a chunky bohemian effect."

      "content": "Elevate tight curls with a chic accent braid. This hairstyle works on short- and medium-length hair. First, part your hair to one side. Use a curling iron to curl your hair. Take a section from the front, starting at the part, and do a Dutch braid that extends across the crown of your head and slightly back. Pin the braid under the curls on the other side. [11] X Research source A Dutch braid is essentially an inverted French braid. Instead of braiding and pulling hair inward, you’re braiding the strands outward and pulling hair under the braid."

      "content": "Choose beachy waves for a relaxed quince hairstyle. This look works on any hair length, but is especially easy for those with shoulder-length or shorter hair. Add some bling without a tiara—just a statement hair pin featuring rhinestones or faux pearls. First, part your hair to the side. Give yourself waves using a triple-barrel waver . [12] X Research source Add a sparkly pin on the lower, short side of the part for a glam finishing touch. Hair stylist Nick Arrojo says using a triple-barrel waver tool is simple. “Hold the tool horizontally, press to open the clamp, and capture the top of the hair section between the barrels and clamp,” he explains. Hold for no more than 5 seconds before moving the tool down the section of hair and repeating."

      "content": "Rock a voluminous ponytail for a pretty, functional look. Opt for a ponytail if you’re worried about your hair getting in your eyes, especially when dancing. Start by grabbing a small section of hair from the front right side of your part. Split it into two sections and twist the right section over the left to begin a rope braid . Pick up hair from the right side of the twist and add it to the new right strand before twisting again. Continue to twist the strands over one another, only adding hair from the right side to the right strand. [13] X Research source End your braid just past the ear. Gently tug the rope braid twists upward to make them appear fuller. [14] X Research source Pin the twist to the back of your head with bobby pins. Gather the rest of your hair into a ponytail. [15] X Research source Use a teasing comb to add volume to your pony. [16] X Research source When teasing your hair to create volume, work on small sections of hair below the top pieces. This way, you can hide the teased sections under smooth ones while still achieving a volumized look."

      "content": "Wear a French twist for a subtle, elegant look. The French twist doesn’t require heat tools, making it perfect for birthday girls who want to save time getting ready. Begin by creating a deep side part with a parting comb and gather your hair in your hands, just above the nape of your neck. [17] X Research source While still holding your hair with your right hand, wrap the hair up and around your left hand’s middle and pointer fingers, letting it hang down on the right side. [18] X Research source Lift your two fingers to tug the wrapped hair toward the left, letting some of it slide through your right hand’s grasp. Make one complete turn with your fingers to twist the hair around itself. Bring your fingers up to the top of your head and hold the twisted hair in place in the center. [19] X Research source With your right hand, pull the hair at the base of the twist (near the nape of the neck on the left side) upward along the twist. Tuck excess hair into the twist on the top and right side. Secure with French pins at the bottom and up the right side where the twist is pressed against your head. [20] X Research source"

This low bun will have an understated effect at your quinceañera, leaving the focus on your dress and makeup—though you can always add drama with a tiara. Begin by creating a side part with a parting comb. Leave the parted hair section at the front of your head down. Gather the rest of your hair into a low ponytail at the nape of your neck. [21] X Research source Tie a smaller hair elastic near the bottom quarter of your ponytail. Roll the ponytail underneath itself so this lower elastic is covered and a low bun forms. Secure with bobby pins. Comb the parted section you left out earlier and pull it back and over the bun, pinning it with bobby pins to cover the top of the bun. Loop the hair over the other half of the bun and secure any remaining wisps in your chignon. Struggling to secure the base of your chignon? Professional hair stylist Danielle Chiz recommends using spiral or coil hair ties at the base instead of traditional hair elastics."

      "content": "Sweep your curls over one shoulder for a unique style. While many quince hairstyles are worn in the back, a side-swept hairstyle lets you display your curls in front and better frame your face. Start by parting your hair with a parting comb on one side. The part should almost be above the ear. Curl your hair using a curling iron. Move the hair on the side below the part to the back. Leave the hair opposite the part over your front shoulder. Grab the hair in the upper middle section of the head. Pin it at the back of your scalp so it’s flowing toward the shoulder where the hair will rest. Two to three pins should suffice. [23] X Research source Repeat with other sections of hair until they’re all pinned and stable. Push the hair below the pins so it hangs over your shoulder. Spray hairspray to help your curls stay defined."

Create soft waves by curling the hair with a 1.25 in (3.2 cm) barrel curling iron . Create all the curls in the same direction by wrapping them around the iron the same way. Once curled, brush them out to unravel the coils into waves. [24] X Research source"

      "content": "Frame your curls with a fairy-like waterfall braid. Grab a small section of hair at the front of your head and divide it into three sections to begin your waterfall braid . Cross the left (frontmost) strand over the central strand. Then, cross the right strand over the central strand. Instead of repeating as you normally would, drop the left strand and pick up a new section of hair from right beside it. Cross this new left strand over the central strand. Before crossing the right strand over, add a strand of hair from above the braid like you’re doing a French braid. Repeat these steps, switching out the left strands and adding hair to the right strands as you go. The strands you drop will stream down along the braid like a waterfall, while the right side of the braid will be secured against your scalp. Continue your waterfall braid until you reach the opposite ear. Secure with a hair elastic. Use a curling iron to touch up any curls that may have fallen out while you braided."
