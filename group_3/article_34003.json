      "content": "Buy a new outfit or borrow something from a friend. What you wear will depend on the concert and venue type, but there are some basic strategies for concert dress that will help you as you decide what to wear. Dress comfortably. Even if you have a seat, you’ll be on your feet a lot and you may even want to dance or mosh during the concert, so don't wear something that is extremely tight or difficult to move around in. [3] X Research source Don’t over accessorize. A tried and true strategy to avoid over accessorizing is to take one accessory off before you leave your house. [4] X Research source Account for the weather if you’ll be outside. If it’s going to be sunny and hot, wear a hat, sunglasses, and shorts. If it’s going to rain, bring a rain poncho. If it’s going to be cold, dress in layers. [5] X Research source Think about what you’re going to be doing after the show. If you have plans to go out for drinks after the show, wear something that can take you from day to night. Wearing black, navy, or other dark tones is one way to accomplish a day to night look.

This option is good if you don’t really like the idea of sneaking backstage and you can afford to buy the VIP package. You can buy Meet and Greet packages through third-party sites, like Ticketmaster. [10] X Expert Source Nicolas Adams Professional Guitarist Expert Interview. 17 September 2019.
