      "content": "Keep another window or tab open to quickly switch to if someone walks in. It doesn’t matter what other website you have open, as long as it makes it look like you’re doing something besides watching porn. For example, you could have Facebook open in another window on your computer or a blog open in a separate tab on your mobile device. You can also just exit out of the website or file that you’re looking at, but it might look suspicious if you don’t have anything up on your screen when someone walks in."

      "content": "Avoid watching porn with headphones in if other people are at home. Although headphones are better than having the sound playing out loud from the speakers on your computer or mobile device, they’ll make it harder to hear if anyone’s coming. If there’s a chance that someone will walk in on you, it’s better to skip the headphones and just mute whatever you’re watching. If you really want to use headphones, try leaving one of the earbuds out so it’s easier to hear what’s going on around you."

      "title": "Face the door when you’re watching porn so it’s easy to see someone come in.",
      "content": "Face the door when you’re watching porn so it’s easy to see someone come in. If your back is turned to the door, you might not notice someone walk in on you. It also makes it easier for someone to see your screen. Instead, try to face the door so your screen is hidden and so you’ll be immediately alerted if someone enters the room."

      "title": "Rename porn files on your computer so they don’t sound suspicious.",
      "content": "Rename porn files on your computer so they don’t sound suspicious. When you download porn to your computer, the name of the file might make it obvious what’s inside. Fortunately, you can easily change the name of your files to something boring or innocent-sounding so that anyone who comes across them on your computer won’t know what they really are. [1] X Research source For example, you could change the file name to something like “work_documents” or make it a random series of numbers and letters, like “Jmp356.”"

    {
      "title": "Encrypt the files",
      "content": "Encrypt the files on your computer for a more secure option. Encrypting files involves locking them away in a passcode-protected file that’s difficult for others to break into. If you’re worried about someone snooping on your computer and you don’t think renaming your files is enough to keep them hidden, encrypting them might be your best option. [2] X Research source To encrypt your files, you’ll need to download an encryption tool to your computer. Some encryption tools you can use include TrueCrypt, VeraCrypt, and BitLocker."

      "content": "Download a vault app to hide images and videos on your mobile device. Vault apps are apps for mobile devices that allow you to add photos and videos and then lock them away behind a passcode or other form of verification. You can download a vault app from your phone’s app store, store your porn in it, and then hide the app in a folder on your phone so it’s harder to find. Some vault apps you can try include Private Photo Vault Pro, Smart Safe Pro, and Photo Manager Pro."

      "title": "Consider streaming porn instead of storing it on your devices.",
      "content": "Consider streaming porn instead of storing it on your devices. There are a variety of websites available, both free and subscription-based, where you can stream porn online without having to download it to your device. By streaming porn instead of storing it, you won’t have to worry about anyone stumbling across your files. [3] X Research source Even if you stream porn instead of downloading it, you’ll still need to take measures to prevent people from seeing your browsing history."

      "title": "Use private browsing",
      "content": "Use private browsing so your search history isn’t saved. Private browsing, also called “incognito mode” on some web browsers, is a setting you can select that prevents your search history and cookies from any sites you’ve visited from being stored. That way, if someone were to use your device and look at your search history, they wouldn’t see any of the websites you visited while you had private browsing turned on. [4] X Research source You can use private browsing on both your computer and mobile device."

      "title": "Delete your browser history",
      "content": "Delete your browser history if you don’t use private browsing. Even if you don’t use private browsing, you can still delete your search history after the fact so people won’t be able to find it. The right way to delete your browser history will depend on the web browser you’re using and whether you’re on a computer or mobile device, but generally, you’ll go to where your search history is and click on something like “delete history.” [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Use a different browser to watch porn in order to better hide your search history.",
      "content": "Use a different browser to watch porn in order to better hide your search history. If you use your regular browser to watch porn, there’s a greater chance that someone will open it or see something when you’re using it, especially if you forgot to turn on private browsing or delete your browser history. By using a separate browser, you can keep it hidden on your device, and your search history won’t show up if someone borrows your phone and uses your main web browser for something. [6] X Research source Some popular web browsers that you can use on your computer or mobile device include Google Chrome , Firefox , Safari, and Internet Explorer. There are also browsers you can download that won’t track your search history, like Firefox Focus for iOS devices or Krypton Web Browser for Android."

      "content": "Put a passcode on your device so people can’t use it when you’re not around. If you don’t have a passcode on your computer or mobile device, and someone uses it when you’re not around, they might come across your search history. By using a passcode, you won’t have to worry about people snooping on your device. Keep in mind that if someone asks to borrow your phone or computer for something and you refuse to enter the passcode, you’ll look suspicious and they’ll know you’re hiding something. In that situation, you might be better off entering the passcode so you don’t draw attention to yourself."
