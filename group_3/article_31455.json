Repeat this process with your day and year of birth. Next, add those three sums together. Reduce this final sum until you reach a single-digit number. [10] X Research source Here is an example of finding the life path number for August 17th, 1999: Reduce the month: 0 + 8 = 8 . Reduce the day: 1 + 7 = 8 . Reduce the year: 1 + 9 + 9 + 9 = 28 Add the three sums together: 8 + 8 + 28 = 44. Reduce this double-digit by computing 4 + 4 = 8. This birthday’s final life path number is 8. For romantic compatibility, repeat this process for you and your significant other or crush. Then you’ll have both of your life path numbers! Pause calculations if your three sums add up to 11 , 22 , or 33 . These are called master numbers and carry special significance for your life path."

Renowned numerologist Camber Hill recommends learning numerology “as a tool to understand your lover and understand your boyfriend, your girlfriend, your daughter, your son, your grandmother. If you understand just a little bit about their blueprint…it makes relationships which is what garner all the good fortune in your life.”"
