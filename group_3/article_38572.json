      "content": "KidsGuard Pro. This is an app you can install on someone's (presumably your child's) phone or tablet to keep tabs of how they use Instagram and other apps. KidsGuard Pro has tons of tracking features, one of which is tracking who the user has followed, who has followed them, and what they've liked on Instagram. [1] X Research source You can check out a demo of the app in action at https://panel.clevguard.com/demo/my-products . To purchase the app, just click the Products tab at the top of the demo page. You'll need access to the person's phone or tablet to install this app. Keep in mind that it's made to keep tabs on children, not adults—any adult is likely to see the app on their phone and know they are being monitored. Adding surveillance apps to someone's phone may also be illegal in some jurisdictions."

      "content": "Other Instagram-tracking apps. While there may be a variety of apps in the App Store or Play Store that claim to track your friends' follows and followers on Instagram, be cautious about installing them—if an unauthorized app requires your Instagram credentials to log in, it will have access to your entire Instagram account. It's possible that Instagram can even ban you for using some of these apps. Do you research before installing any apps that claim to stalk others on Instagram."

This is going to be difficult if your friend has a lot of followers, but it should be fairly easy if their Followers list is small."

This is not fool-proof, but it can help you figure out who your friend is communicating with who they may not have been friends with before. Tap the number of likes below your friend's top 3 most recent posts, and compare the list to people who've liked their posts in the past. Are there any new names on the list? It's possible they've followed your friend only recently, and vice-versa."
