[8] X Research source For Retail Ground and First Class Mail, you can use any sturdy cardboard box. You don’t have to use the USPS Priority Mail box. Use a box that will hold your shipment but still leaves a little bit of room for you to add any padding material. If your box has other stickers or logos other than the USPS logo for Priority Mail boxes, cross them out with a marker or cover them with your postage label. Make sure your box does not have anything loose hanging from it like twine, string, or tape because it can get caught in the sorting equipment."
