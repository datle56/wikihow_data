      "title": "Decide whether the parent or the grandma will choose the name.",
      "content": "Decide whether the parent or the grandma will choose the name. It’s most common for a new grandma to get to choose her nickname herself—she can come up with someone that feels authentic to her, then run it by the new parent or parents to make sure that it feels natural for them as well. If grandma doesn’t feel up for choosing her own name, then the parents might take over in choosing a name. This approach may be especially useful in blended families with multiple sets of grandparents, including step-grandparents. [9] X Research source Emotions may be already heightened in these scenarios, and ensuring that a step-grandmother doesn’t reserve the title of “grandma” while the biological grandmother is deferred (unwillingly) to a less official name might be best for everyone in the long run. With multiple sets of grandparents, you might also consider using distinctive, matching names for each couple to make things less confusing for the baby. For instance, one set could be Gram and Gramps, while others could be Nanny and Pappy, Lolly and Pop, etc."

Cross off any names that you definitely don’t want. Then, go through the list again and circle 5-7 names that you best like the sound of. Once you’ve identified your top names, consider if there’s a pattern among them—are they more unique or youthful, or are they traditional? Do they all start with the same letter? Even if you didn’t know it consciously, you might be gravitating toward a certain type of name. Keep this pattern in mind as you continue to narrow down your options."

But why are so many women rejecting traditional terms like “grandma,” “granny,” and “grandmother”? According to some sources, the term “grandma” is heavily associated with old age, and many modern grandmothers don’t feel like the name matches where they are mentally and physically. [13] X Research source This shift may be due with the change in societal views toward again. People above the age of 65 feel more active and youthful now than they have in previous decades, according to research studies , so it tracks that today’s grandmothers may want to choose a more youthful name that feels more authentic and natural.
