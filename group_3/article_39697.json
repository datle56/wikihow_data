      "content": "The bird flu, or avian influenza, is a class of viral infections in poultry. The bird flu generally refers to an influenza virus that is predominantly found among poultry like chickens, pheasants, ducks, geese, quail, and turkeys, although some variants (including the 2024-25 one) target cows. Like the flu, coronavirus, or cancer in humans, there are different variants of avian influenza. Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) A (H5N1), or H5N1 for short , is the variant to blame for the 2024-25 spike in egg prices, which occurred because so many sick chickens had to be put down. [1] X Trustworthy Source Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Main public health institute for the US, run by the Dept. of Health and Human Services Go to source Influenza (the “flu”) exists across tons of different genus and species. There are bird flus, human flus, swine flues, and so on. A flu is a type of highly contagious respiratory disease, so any mammal with lungs can become a target. [2] X Research source Bird flu epidemics have appeared multiple times throughout history (it seems to happen about once ever 3-5 years). The 2024-25 variant, APAI A (H5N1), is just more dangerous for birds than the past few epidemics have been, so it’s had a bigger impact on egg and chicken prices. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Sudden unexpected death Unfortunately, the first sign of bird flu is usually random and unexpected death. You may notice death rates in your flock skyrocketing out of nowhere, or that a handful of birds have suddenly died within a few days of one another. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Depressed or quiet egg layers",
      "content": "Depressed or quiet egg layers Any egg-laying hens will tend to act somewhat withdrawn or depressed if they’ve got bird flu. Hens may seem asocial, disinterested in nesting, or generally disagreeable if they’re ill. [5] X Research source Keep your flock’s personality in mind here. If a hen who always seems kind of quiet and depressive is being a little slow and inactive, don’t assume it’s the bird flu. Are your birds laying eggs at all? If so, inspect the eggs. Avian flu can cause abnormally soft or oddly-shaped eggs."

      "title": "Lack of energy",
      "content": "Lack of energy Chickens tend to become tired the exact same way people tend to be exhausted when they’ve got the flu. It takes resources to fight a virus, so your hens are unlikely to play or run around their environment—even when foraging for food. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Coughing or sneezing",
      "content": "Coughing or sneezing Look for any kind of nasal discharge, too. All of these are signs that a bird may be carrying avian flu. [8] X Research source This is the primary way avian flu spreads from bird to bird. A sick chicken will infect their environment by coughing or secreting fluids and other birds will be exposed because they’re in close quarters."

      "content": "Loss of coordination Birds infected with avian influenza tend to stumble around, fall down, and struggle to make complex movements without tripping themselves up. Some farmers describe this symptom by saying it looks like the chickens are drunk. If birds in your flock aren’t moving like normal, they’re likely sick. [10] X Research source"

Put on coveralls, boots, gloves, eye protection, and a dust mask. Put the sick chicken in a secluded area completely separate from all other birds. Keep sick birds quarantined for at least two weeks, although 45 days is ideal. [14] X Research source Wash your hands and clothes after every interaction with a chicken from here on out.
