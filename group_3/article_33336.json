Cards with a 2 do not have a rank. [4] X Research source For example, after the first person puts down the 3 of clubs, the player to their left must put down a 4 or higher. If the second player puts down a 4, the third player must put down a 5 or higher. They cannot put down a 3."

The person who put the 2 down can now choose any card and play it. The person after them now has to outrank this new card. [5] X Research source A 2 card cannot be the last card that you play in your hand.

[7] X Research source So if you put down a pair of 5’s, the next person must put down a pair of 6’s or higher. They cannot put down 1 king (even though it outranks a 6) or a pair of 4’s (because although they have a matching pair, 4 is a lower rank). If all 4 cards of a number are put down, the pile is cleared. So if 4 aces are put down, you clear the pile and the last person to play sets down a new card."

These positions are useful if you will allow the president to make up new rules as the game goes on. Vice-a-hole is the second-to-last player to lose their cards. At the beginning of a new round, the vice-a-hole gives the president 1 card while the a-hole gives the president 2."

This can be anything that the president wants. For example: If you are playing with extra positions, you might make up special rules for them, since normally there are none. For example, you might say that the treasurer and secretary can trade cards at the beginning of every round. If you’re playing this as a drinking game, you might make a rule like “Everyone must drink when the 8 of clubs is played” or “whoever puts down a matching set must drink.”"

The next player would still have to put down 2 cards of a higher rank. [15] X Research source In this variation, a larger set will always beat a lower rank. So if you play a pair of 6’s, the next person can beat you with a trio of 4’s. The person after them can beat that with a complete set of 3’s."

In some variations of the game, when the president says “board meeting,” everyone finishes their drinks. Traditionally, the a-hole must refill people’s drinks."
