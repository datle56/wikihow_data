      "content": "Preheat your oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit (177 degrees Celsius). Grab a large baking tray for your cashews, but do not add any grease to the tray. If you’re concerned about the nuts sticking, however, you can line the tray with parchment paper. If roasting a small amount of cashews, consider using a cake pan instead, which you can shake frequently during cooking to toss the oils. [1] X Research source Cashews can be oil roasted or dry roasted. If you dry roast the cashews and wish to add salt without adding any oil, try coating or spraying your cashews with brine or salt-water solution, then letting them dry, before roasting them. This helps the salt adhere to the nuts."

      "title": "Spread the cashews evenly across the baking tray.",
      "content": "Spread the cashews evenly across the baking tray. Try to keep the cashews in a single, even layer to promote even roasting. If working with large batches, it would be preferable to use multiple trays rather than piling the cashews into one."
    },
    {
      "title": "Consider adding oil.",
      "content": "Consider adding oil. Roasting cashews with a little oil is recommended, but not strictly necessary. Drizzle between 1 and 2 tsp (5 and 10 mL) of oil over the cashews. Stir and toss the cashews gently on the baking tray to coat evenly with oil. Roasting the nuts in oil will enhance the flavor and texture, but it will increase the overall oiliness of the finished product. If you're using them for baking purposes (e.g., adding them to cookies or brownies), omit the oil and skip this step. If you're eating them on their own or using them as a garnish, however, roast the cashews in oil. [2] X Research source Less is more in this step. You can add more oil later, as needed, after your cashews have started roasting. You can use a nut oil, like almond oil or walnut oil, or opt for another healthy oil, like grapeseed oil, olive oil, or coconut oil."

      "content": "Roast the cashews in the oven on the middle rack for five to eight minutes. After five to eight minutes, remove them from the oven and stir using a spoon or spatula. This helps apply a new layer of oil to the cashews and reduces the risk of burning."

    {
      "title": "Return to the oven and roast, stirring frequently, until done.",
      "content": "Return to the oven and roast, stirring frequently, until done. Return the cashews to the oven and continue roasting them in three to five minute intervals, stirring well after each interval concludes. Cashews should only need between 8 and 15 minutes of total roasting time before being ready. When ready, the nuts should release a strong yet pleasing odor and look several shades darker. You may even hear some crackling if you cooked them in oil. Cashews can burn quickly, so it's important that you check and stir frequently to minimize this risk."

      "title": "Drizzle additional oil and add salt.",
      "content": "Drizzle additional oil and add salt. Remove the cashews from the oven. If desired, drizzle another 1 to 2 tsp (5 to 10 mL) of oil over the cashews, then sprinkle them with about 1/2 tsp (2.5 ml) of salt, adding more or less depending on personal taste. If adding the roasted cashews to baked goods, you may wish to skip the oil and salt. You could also use other seasonings as desired during this step. Examples of seasonings that complement the flavor of cashews include cinnamon, sugar, paprika, cayenne, cloves, and nutmeg. If you soaked the nuts in brine or salt water before roasting them, do not add any additional seasoning here. The initial salt in the solution should be enough."

Transferring them prevents the hot baking tray or cake pan from scorching the nuts. Once cooled, you can serve or use the cashews immediately. You may also store them in an airtight container at room temperature for up to two weeks."

Since the honey coating is so sticky, honey-roasted cashews are likely to stick to the baking tray if you leave it unlined. Nonstick foil or parchment paper is strongly recommended."

For an even simpler version, you can stick with only honey, butter, and cinnamon. The maple syrup, salt, and vanilla all enhance the flavor of the cashews, but are not strictly necessary."

[4] X Research source Roasting the cashews for only five minutes will warm them up without impacting the taste and texture much; roasting them for a total of 12 to 15 minutes will give the nuts a more traditional roasted flavor and crunch."

[6] X Research source If you'd like to add more dimension to this recipe, you could try adding both honey and maple syrup; stick with a total of 1/4 cup (60 ml), but vary the proportions according to your own sense of taste.
