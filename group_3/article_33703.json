      "content": "Pop larger blood blisters. You should try to refrain from popping blood blisters if possible. However, if it gets too painful, you can pop larger blood blisters. If your blood blister is larger than a pea, or it is causing significant discomfort, pain, or interfering with walking or working, you can carefully pop the blood blister. [1] X Research source You should know that this can significantly increase the risk of infection, so be very careful and follow the instructions as closely as possible. It really is best to have a physician do this with sterile instruments, but that is realistically not always possible."

If you have alcohol, soak a pin or needle in the alcohol. [3] X Research source Alternatively, you can soak the pin or needle in a solution of the antibacterial soap for 10 minutes. You can also boil the pin or needle. Use tongs to take the pin or needle out of the boiling water and use it while it is still warm. Another option is to hold the tip of the needle directly over a flame for a minute. Make sure you let it cool before using it."
