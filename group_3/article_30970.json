      "content": "Purchase the right amounts of cement, sand, and stone. The precise ratios will vary depending on the type of cement, so make sure to check your bag or the instructions that came with your cement. However, as a general rule of thumb, you will need one part cement, two parts sand, and four parts stone. Always follow the instructions that came with the cement since adding too much sand, gravel, or cement can cause the concrete to break.

      "title": "Dump your ingredients into a wheelbarrow.",
      "content": "Dump your ingredients into a wheelbarrow. Use your small spade to shovel a ratio of one part cement, two parts sand, and four parts gravel into the wheelbarrow. Make sure you're wearing your dust mask, as dust and debris will get into the air during the process. To prevent the cement from drying out before you use it, don’t mix more than half a wheelbarrow at a time. Once you’ve used it up, you can create another batch."

      "title": "Mix the ingredients together.",
      "content": "Mix the ingredients together. Though they'll be mixed later, it's a good idea to have the dry mix thoroughly incorporated before adding the water. After pouring your cement, sand, and stone into the wheelbarrow, use a shovel or similar tool to mix the ingredients together until you have an even, uniform mixture. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Make a crater in the pile of cement.",
      "content": "Make a crater in the pile of cement. Use your shovel to dig a small crater in the center of your cement mixture. The crater should be about half the diameter of the pile. When you're done, your pile should resemble a volcano."

    {
      "title": "Add a small amount of water.",
      "content": "Add a small amount of water. There is no precise amount of water to add to your cement. You merely need to add enough that you form a smooth paste with the consistency of peanut butter. Start small to avoid creating cement that's too soupy. Pour a small amount of water, like half a bucket, into the crater you made. Then, mix in the water with your shovel until it's completely absorbed. [6] X Research source If you're using the cement for something that will have a concrete finish, 3 parts concrete to 1 part water is usually best. If you're using the cement for a concrete foundation, it's OK if you use more water since the finish won't matter.

      "title": "Test the mixture.",
      "content": "Test the mixture. Drag a shovel through the center of the cement. If the mixture is too dry, the sides of the groove you created will crumble. This means the mixture needs more water. [8] X Research source"

      "title": "Adjust the mixture as necessary.",
      "content": "Adjust the mixture as necessary. It will take some trial and error to get the right consistency. Add water a little at a time until you have a firm, spreadable paste. If you accidentally get the paste too wet, to the point the cement is soupy, add a little more of the dry mixture to fix this issue. [9] X Research source"

      "content": "Pour the mixed cement immediately into your project's area. This step needs to be completed as soon as possible. This prevents the cement from drying before you can complete your project. Tilt the wheelbarrow over the area where you're applying cement and pour the cement mixture in."
