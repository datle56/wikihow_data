      "content": "Place 2 AAA, 1.5-volt batteries into the transmitter, if you have one. If your digital clock comes with a weather transmitter, slide the battery compartment off of the back of the device. Then, insert the batteries into the compartment according to the polarities indicated on the case. [1] X Research source Place the battery door back over the compartment once you insert the batteries. Note : Some models may take 2 AA batteries instead. The weather transmitter senses the temperature outside and displays it on the clock."

      "content": "Wait 10 minutes for the outdoor temperature to display on the clock. Set the transmitter next to the clock; this helps it sync up with the clock. It may take up to 10 minutes before you see the outdoor temperature on the clock. [3] X Research source If the outdoor temperature doesn’t display, remove the transmitter batteries and then the clock batteries. Wait 10 minutes and then reinsert the transmitter batteries and then the clock batteries. Place the transmitter outside once the outdoor temperature is set. Put it in a dry, shaded location no more than 200 feet (61 m) away from the clock."

Wait for the time zone to flash and then use the “+” button to select the correct time zone. PST is Pacific Standard Time, MST is Mountain Standard Time, and CST is Central Standard Time. Note : Some older models have a time zone switch on the back. Simply slide the switch to the correct time zone you’re in. The digital clocks are automatically set to EST, so skip this step if you are in EST."

      "content": "Set your atomic clock in a window overnight to sync with the time. Once you put in the batteries, your clock starts searching for the WWVB signal that sets the date and time. The WWVB signal goes out every hour between 12 am to 6 am, so place the clock in a window and leave it there overnight so it can detect and receive the signal. [4] X Research source Ensure the clock is at least 6 feet (2 m) away from TVs, computers, kitchen appliances, and other electronics. These devices can interfere with the signal. Metal and concrete structures can also interfere with the WWVB signal. The WWVB tower icon on the clock’s display starts flashing when it detects the signal. When the clock receives the signal, the WWVB tower icon becomes permanently lit. The WWVB signal is transmitted by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in Fort Collins, Colorado.

If you want your clock to show the correct time while it’s searching for the WWVB signal, press and hold the “Set” button for 3 seconds to cycle through the manual settings. When the display flashes for each setting, use the “+” button to make changes. [6] X Research source Press “Set” 2 times for daylight savings time (DST). You can turn DST off or on. Press “Set” 3 times for the language. You can change the language to US (English), F (French), E (Spanish), or d (German). Press “Set” 4 times to set the hour. Press “Set” 5 times to set the minute. Press “Set” 6 times to set the year. Press “Set” 7 times to set the date. Press “Set” 8 times to set the weekday. Press “Set” 9 times for 12 or 24 hour time display. You can choose to set the time in regular time (12-hour clock) or military time (24-hour clock). Press “Set” 10 times to set the temperature as Fahrenheit or Celsius. To exit manual settings mode , press the “SNZ” button on the back of the clock. The settings order may be slightly different for different clock models. Note : Your manual settings will get overridden when your clock receives the WWVB signal."

[8] X Research source Keep the clock 6 feet (2 m) away from TVs, computers, kitchen appliances, and other electronics as they can interfere with the WWVB signal.
