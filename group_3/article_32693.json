There, you can see how many days after germination your cucumbers should be ready to harvest and how long your particular cucumbers should grow. This will give you a rough time frame of when to be on the lookout for ripe cucumbers. If you can't locate the seed packet, or bought your seedlings from a garden center and don't know exactly when they germinated, there are other ways to tell when your cucumbers are ripe. Most cucumbers are ready to harvest about 50-70 days after germination. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Look for female flowers appearing on the vine. Cucumbers have separate male and female flowers, and the first flowers to appear are male, not female flowers. Female flowers have a cucumber-shaped swelling at the stem end of the flower. This is what will grow into the fruit. [2] X Research source After the female flower appears, it will only take 8-10 days for a cucumber to grow to a mature size. [3] X Research source Cucumbers become bitter and develop tough skins and seeds if left on the vine too long. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Check the length of your growing cucumbers. Depending on the variety of cucumber, they will be ripe at different lengths. Remember that cucumbers grow rapidly with plenty of water, so keep an eye on emerging baby cucumbers every day. As well, the more frequently you find and remove ripe cucumbers, the more cucumbers the vine will produce. [5] X Research source Regular slicing cucumbers are ready when they are about 6 inches (15 cm) to 8 inches (20 cm) long. [6] X Research source Harvest dills are ready at 4 inches (10 cm) to 6 inches (15 cm) long, and pickling cucumbers at 2 inches (5.1 cm) long. [7] X Research source Large burpless cucumbers are ready at about 10 inches (25 cm), and some types are even longer. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Cut above the cucumber .25 inches (0.64 cm) to 1 inch (2.5 cm) from the vine. Support the cucumber with your other hand. If the cucumber falls, it will become bruised. Some people grab and twist the fruit off with their hands, but this can damage the plant. Wear a pair of gloves to protect your hands from the cucumber’s prickly spines. Be sure to handle burpless cucumbers carefully, as they have thin skins and bruise easily. [9] X Research source"

[12] X Research source Hothouse cucumbers can stay in the refrigerator for 1 to 2 days, though the temperature can’t be too low or they will freeze and turn soft. [13] X Research source Pickled cucumbers will be edible for up to 1 year. [14] X Research source"
