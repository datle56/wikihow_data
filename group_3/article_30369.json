      "content": "The Mammoth Fruit is rare and harder to get. It's a mythical Beast-type Fruit, and there are a few ways for you to get this Fruit: [1] X Research source The easiest is to purchase the Mammoth Fruit from the Advanced Blox Fruits Dealer at the Mirage Island for $2,700,000 or 2,350 Roblux. Note that the Mirage Island has a chance of spawning when you're in Sea Danger 0-6, and the dealer has a higher chance of carrying this Fruit. Purchase the Mammoth Fruit from the Blox Fruits Dealer in any of the 3 seas on numerous islands for $2,700,000 or 2,350 Roblux.: Pirate Starter Island Marine Starter Island Middle Town Kingdom of Rose (Docks, Second Sea) Caf√© (Second Sea) Mansion (Third Sea) Port Town (Third Sea) Purchasing Mammoth Fruit with Robux grants you permanent use of the Fruit, while buying it with Beli guarantees a one-time use item. Roll fruits at the Blox Fruit Gacha, but this has a very low chance (1-2%) of dropping the Mammoth Fruit. Other ways to get this Fruit include trading for it , completing raids in the second and third seas, and exploring islands to find it under trees."

      "title": "Grind Sea Events easily while transformed.",
      "content": "Grind Sea Events easily while transformed. The transformed version of this Fruit makes a mediocre Fruit into an awesome Fruit. While transformed into a mammoth, you can deal continuous damage by holding F, and your M1 button also deals damage to Sea Beasts. Added to that is your damage reduction (50%) and the fact that you can stand on water. All this makes the Mammoth Fruit a great choice for raids that need high defence and decent AoE attacks."

      "title": "Is Mammoth better than T-Rex, Magma, or Buddha?",
      "content": "Is Mammoth better than T-Rex, Magma, or Buddha? They each have their pros and cons. For example, while the T-Rex Fruit has great damage and moves that break Instinct, it also has a Fury Meter that limits when and how long you can transform. Meanwhile, the Mammoth Fruit has great damage without the Fury Meter, so you can transform whenever and for an unlimited time. The Buddha Fruit , on the other hand, doesn't have the damage reduction that the Mammoth Fruit has. However, damage reduction might not be a concern, in which case, Buddha Fruit is better for you. Magma Fruit , alternatively, has low mastery requirements, so it's easier to use if you don't have a high mastery in it. It's also great for grinding and boss fights because of this."
