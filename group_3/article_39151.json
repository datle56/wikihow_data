Before you cut out the pattern pieces, trace along the desired size lines with a red pencil or highlighter. This will help to ensure that you cut out the pieces in the correct size. Then, use a sharp pair of scissors to cut along the lines. [9] X Research source Different groups of pattern pieces for a design are usually indicated by letters, such as A, B, and C. For example, if you’re making a 2-piece suit, you’d only need the pieces for the jacket and pants, but if you’re making a 3-piece suit, you’d need the pieces for the jacket, pants, and vest. The 2-piece suit might be marked with an A while the 3-piece suit pieces might have an A and B or just a B on them.

Insert pins perpendicular to the edges of the fabric where indicated by your sewing pattern. Place 1 pin every 2 to 3 in (5.1 to 7.6 cm) along the edges of the pieces. For example, if you’re attaching one of the front panels for the suit jacket to the back panel, you’ll need to pin the pieces starting along the edges of the 2 pieces that will go under the armpit and go all the way to the bottom of the 2 pieces."
