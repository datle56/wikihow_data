      "content": "Pick up litter on the roadways to keep streets safe. U.S. roadways are littered with a variety of waste, with the most common trash items being tobacco products (cigarette butts), paper, and plastic. Highways, roadways, and side streets are all common litter sites because motorists tend to throw trash and waste out of vehicle windows. Litter on the streets can be a safety hazard, as waste can damage cars that drive over it, blow into motorists' windshields, or even catch fire. [1] X Research source Always use extreme caution when picking up trash on roadways– never pick up litter in the middle of the street. Wear safety vests and only pick up in the daytime so that you are clearly visible to motorists."

      "content": "Remove litter near transition points to keep businesses and public services tidy. Transition points include entrances to businesses or public services that prohibit certain items, like movie theaters, stadiums, or buses. The most common trash found by transportation points are confections (candy and gum) and cigarette butts.

Always ask permission from the store owner or manager before proceeding if picking up litter in front of a privately owned business."

      "content": "Look for litter in recreational areas while camping or hiking. Places where people congregate for leisure, such as parks and beaches, accumulate litter very quickly. Choose to pick up litter in these recreational areas to keep them looking nice and welcoming for locals and tourists– and to protect surrounding wildlife! Ocean trash is a serious problem that can not only affect that appearance of our public beaches but can also affect the health of people and wildlife. If you plan on taking a trip to the beach, be prepared by bringing a couple of trash bags along with you to pick up excess garbage."
