      "content": "Distract yourself with a healthier activity. Distraction is a great way to avoid temptation because it shifts your thoughts to something else. If you aren’t thinking about your temptation, it’s easier to say “no.” Choose a distraction that you enjoy so the temptation will lose its appeal. [1] X Research source For example, let’s say you’re tempted to eat a second slice of dessert, even though you know it’s unhealthy. You might distract yourself by engaging in your hobby or calling a friend. Let's say you just broke up with your partner and are tempted to text them, even though you know it's a bad idea. You might instead start a conversation with a friend or distract your attention with your favorite hobby."

      "content": "Tell yourself you'll indulge your craving in 15 mins, then delay it longer. This helps you avoid giving into temptation until your craving passes. It's easier to wait 15 minutes than it is to think you can never have what you want, so you can use this technique to trick your brain. Eventually, your craving should fade away For example, let's say you're trying to lose weight but you keep craving candy. Set a timer for 15 minutes, then start doing another task. Keep delaying the treat for 15 minutes until you aren't tempted anymore."

      "content": "List the consequences of giving into your temptation. Imagine what will happen if you give into temptation. What will your life look like in the long run? How will you feel tomorrow? Facing the consequences can help you resist whenever temptation arises. [2] X Research source Let’s say you’re tempted to cheat on your partner. You might imagine yourself telling your partner and losing your relationship. You could also list the other things you’d lose, like your good reputation, friendships, and time with your children, if you have them. You might be at a party where you're tempted to use illegal drugs. Imagine getting caught by your parents or police. Consider what could happen if your school or job found out. You might get kicked out of your school activities and may have a harder time getting into the college you hope to attend."

      "content": "Visualize yourself resisting the temptation to increase your resolve. Picture yourself saying “no” to whatever is tempting you. Imagine that you’re successful in resisting, and picture yourself reaching your goals. This helps you feel like resistance is possible. [3] X Research source For example, let's say you're trying to save money for a trip, but you feel tempted to buy an expensive new pair of shoes. You could visualize yourself walking out of the store without making a purchase. Then, imagine yourself reaching your savings goal and going on your trip. Keep your visualizations positive. If a new obstacle arises in your mind, imagine yourself overcoming that, as well. Using visualization takes practice, so it might not feel as helpful at first. Keep picturing yourself being successful, and you’ll start to believe it."

      "content": "Label your temptation so you can confront it. Denying a craving will only make it worse because you won’t be able to stop thinking about it. Instead, acknowledge how you feel. Think about why you might feel that way, and then list other, healthier ways you can satisfy your needs. [4] X Research source For instance, you might crave sugary snacks every afternoon when you feel an energy slump. Tell yourself, “I really want candy right now because I’m tired. I can get a similar boost by drinking green tea, instead.” As another example, let’s say you’re tempted to have a one night stand even though you’re in a relationship. You might say to yourself, “This person is very attractive and I haven’t been feeling satisfied lately, so I’m thinking about going home with them. Since I want to save my relationship, I’m going to think of a few ways I can feel closer to my partner.”"

[13] X Research source For instance, you might believe it's immoral to buy unethically-sourced products. When you feel tempted to indulge yourself, you might think about the reasons this is important to you or text a friend who believes the same way.

You might notice that you feel tempted to eat ice cream every night when you have a carton in your home. You could avoid buying a whole carton and instead treat yourself to small servings of ice cream on occasion. As another example, you might feel tempted to drink alcohol when you’re at parties, even though you're underage.
