      "content": "This is the easiest way to handle a booty text. Don't send any response at all, and they'll realize you aren't into it. In the meantime, focus on other things to take your mind off this person. Wait until they text something else before you send a new text. They might try to call you after you ignore the text. Just ignore their phone call, too. If they ask for a response, tell them you're not going to respond. Text, “There's nothing to say,\" or \"Take a hint.\" You may not be the only person they texted for a booty call, so it’s likely they won’t ask you about it later. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Go with a meme or gif for an easy, playful rejection. Click on the \"gif\" or \"image search\" button on your messaging app if you have one. Otherwise, type \"gif\" and something like \"no\" or \"rejection\" into your search browser to pull up a good meme. Pick a meme or gif that expresses your response. Let it speak for you! [2] X Research source For instance, you might send a gif of someone laughing or of Michael Scott from The Office shouting, “Nooooooooo.” You could also use Leslie Jones saying, \"No! I say no!\" If you’d rather send a meme, you could pick a cute one with a simple “no.” For instance, you might use the Bugs Bunny \"no\" meme or Dr. Evil saying, \"How about no?\" You might also make your own using a free website like imgflip.com. For instance, you could use the “no/yes lady” meme. Put “hooking up” on the “no” side and “being just friends” on the “yes” side."

      "content": "This works great when the booty caller is a friend. Pretend like you didn’t realize they were being serious. Keep your response short and light-hearted. Then, change the subject.

      "content": "Use an excuse to let them down easy and avoid awkwardness. Tell them you’re unable to hook-up because you’re busy. Pick a reason they won’t be able to pick apart. Just keep in mind they may booty text you again on another day. [4] X Research source Say something like, “I’d like to, but I’m out of town right now,” or “I can’t! I’m babysitting a friend’s kids tonight.”"

      "title": "This works great if you want to maintain a relationship with the texter.",
      "content": "This works great if you want to maintain a relationship with the texter. Type a concise, direct message saying you aren’t interested. Then, change the subject to move the conversation along. You might say, “No, I’m not into booty calls,” or “I only go home with someone I’m dating.” If you hope to date this person, give them a compliment before you say “no.” You could text, “You’re really hot, but booty calls aren’t my thing,” or “As tempting as this sounds, I don’t do booty calls.”"

      "title": "Go with this option if you're interested in dating them.",
      "content": "Go with this option if you're interested in dating them. Tell them that you value them and want to keep getting to know them better. Then, say you're interested in a real relationship rather than just casual sex. [5] X Research source Add that you can’t do the booty call because it would ruin everything. [6] X Research source Text something like, “You’re so amazing! I would never ruin what we have going on by hooking up too soon,” or “I’d like to spend some one-on-one time with you, but only after a few dates.” Although it'll hurt if they aren't interested, hooking up with them won't change their mind. If you don't want to be a booty call, it's better to let them go and focus on someone else."

      "content": "Go this route if you’re hoping for a relationship and are feeling bold. Start your response by telling the person you’re interested in meeting up with them. Next, suggest an alternative way to spend time together without having sex. Make sure the activity you pick won’t offer an opportunity to hook-up. Say, “I’d like to get together, but I’m not into hook-ups. We could try dinner?” or “Hanging out tonight sounds fun, but I’d rather get drinks.” For example, you might go out for a night-cap, see a late-night movie, or go out for midnight pancakes and cocoa."

      "content": "Do this if you’re upset and want them to know. Take a deep breath to calm your nerves, then type out how you feel. Explain that you’re hurt or angry, and ask that this person stop sending you booty texts. Don’t worry about explaining your reasons because you don’t have to. You could text, “You’re disrespecting me right now. Don’t send booty texts,\" \"This is not okay!\" or, \"I thought we were really good friends, but now I'm questioning that. Why would you think it's okay to send this?\""

Open the settings in your messenger app and add the person’s number to block it. You won’t have to worry about them anymore! If an ex won’t leave you alone, blocking them is your best option. It’s also a good idea to block people if they’re really pestering you."
