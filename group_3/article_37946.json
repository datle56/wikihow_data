Be clear about each step and how you are going to move them or support them. This will prepare them for the move so they are not caught off guard.

Notice if 1 side feels stronger in your hands. [3] X Research source You can also test their feet by gripping each of their feet between your hands. Ask the patient to press down on your hands like they are pressing the accelerator of a car. Notice which side feels stronger in your hands."

Look around the transfer area for any loose cords or tubes and adjust these items so they are not in your way. You want to have your feet firmly planted on the ground in the transfer area so you are not at risk of slipping or losing your footing. [4] X Research source You should be wearing non-slip shoes to ensure you have a solid grip on the floor. If you are transferring a patient from a bed, check that the wheels on the bed are in the locked position so it does not move or shift when you transfer the patient. If you are transferring a patient in their home, move any area or throw rugs that could cause you to trip."

If you are using a wheelchair, make sure the wheels are locked and swing away the foot rests at the bottom of the chair so the patient can slide into it easily. [5] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Putting the chair on the patient’s dominant side will help you move them more easily, as they will be able to put more strength into you as you transfer them.

If the patient has suffered a stroke or other issues that affects their motor functions, attach a gait belt around their waist. The gait belt will also give you a better grip during the transfer so the patient does not fall out of your arms. Wrap the belt around the patient’s waist so it is snug, but not too tight. Tuck any extra fabric at the end of the belt into the belt so it is not a tripping hazard. Do not use the gait belt as a handle or a way to pick up the patient.
