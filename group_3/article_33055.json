      "content": "Split into teams of 2 players for a standard game. Canasta is usually a 4-player game, so find a few friends to play with. Shuffle a deck of cards and take turns picking one at random. The players with the 2 highest-ranked cards form one team and the other players form the second team. Sit across from your partner. [1] X Research source Aces are considered the highest rank. If 2 cards have the same rank, compare the suits. When you’re setting up the game, spades are the highest, followed by hearts, diamonds, and clubs. If you’re playing with 2 or 3 people, each person plays the game individually. While you can play Canasta with 5 or 6 players, one player has to sit out of each round."

Choose a player to be the first dealer and deal them face-down to each player one at a time. Set the rest of the cards in a facedown deck, or “stock,” in the middle of the table. [2] X Research source You can look at the cards in your hand, but keep them secret from the other players, including your partner! For a 2-player game, give 15 cards to each player. For 3-player games, deal out 13 cards to each person. You may also use a commercial Canasta set that has the cards’ point values printed on them and comes with score sheets."

      "content": "Flip the top card of the deck to set up the discard pile. Turn over the top card of the deck and set it face-up right next to it. If the card is a joker, 2, or a red 3, keep flipping cards from the deck until it’s a 4 or higher. [3] X Research source When jokers, 2s, or 3s are discarded, they “freeze” the discard pile. Turn these cards sideways. We’ll cover what that means and how to unfreeze the discard pile a little further down."

Playing cards during a round earns you points, but cards left in your hand at the end of the game subtract from your score. The card point values are: [4] X Research source Red 3s: 100 points Jokers: 50 points Aces and 2s (deuces): 20 points Kings, Queens, Jacks, 10s, 9s, and 8s: 10 points 7s, 6s, 5s, 4s, and black 3s: 5 points"

      "content": "Melds Melds are groups of 3 or more cards that have the same rank, such as Q-Q-Q or 10-10-10. Jokers and 2s are wild cards, so they count as any rank in a meld. When you play cards from your hands, you either play a new meld or add cards to an existing meld. Aces down to 4s are considered “natural” cards. Melds must always have 2 natural cards when you play them."

      "title": "Canastas",
      "content": "Canastas Canastas are melds of 7 or more cards of the same rank. Canastas can be formed like normal melds with a mix of natural and wild cards. Canastas earn big points and teams need to form one during a round if they want to go out first. [5] X Research source A “natural” canasta is a meld of 7 or more cards without using any wilds and is worth 500 points. If there’s at least 1 wild card, then it’s considered a “dirty” canasta and is worth 300 points."

At the start of your turn, choose to either draw the top card of the deck or take all of the cards in the discard pile. While you’re always able to draw a card on your turn, there are some restrictions for taking the discard pile. [6] X Research source You can only take the discard pile when it’s frozen if you have 2 natural cards in your hand matching the top card’s rank. This immediately unfreezes the discard pile. When the discard pile is unfrozen, you may take all the cards if you’re able to use the top card immediately in any meld. If you have a red 3 in your hand, play it face-up in front of you and draw a replacement card before choosing the next cards to take. If you draw a red 3, play it right away in front of you and draw a new card."

If a player already has melds from past turns, they can add wilds or natural cards of the same rank to them. [7] X Research source Teammates share melds, and can never have 2 separate melds of the same rank. You may only meld black 3s if they cause you to play all the cards in your hand. The first melds each team plays must be worth a set number of points based on the team’s current score. At the start of the game, the total for the melds played must be worth 50 points."

If their team has at least one canasta, a player can use the last card in their hand in a meld or discard it to end the round. If a player only has one card in their hand but their team doesn’t have a canasta, they cannot discard their last card. If a player can go out but isn’t sure if their teammate wants to score more points, they can ask “May I go out?” Their teammate can either say yes or no, and the player must do what they’re told. Alternatively, the game can end when the stock runs out of cards. Because players can’t draw cards at the start of their turn, they must take the discard pile and meld it immediately. If they’re not able to play the card, then the game ends."

That way, you can take the discard pile to make large melds. Also, pay attention to what your opponents play to see what cards they’re interested in picking up. For example, you know there are only 8 Jacks. If your opponent lays down 3 of them in a meld, you know there are only 5 left in the other hands or the draw pile."

This works best when the discard pile is frozen so nobody can pick it up unless they can make a meld. Your opponent might put down a card you need. Keep 2 cards of the same rank in your hand so you can pick up the discard pile when it’s your turn again. Another option is to put down a card that you think your opponent needs to force them to pick up a large discard pile of subpar cards.
