Windows (using a third-party app): If you have WinRAR or another app that can unpack .TAR files, double-click the .TAR file to open it, select the Extract option, choose a saving location, and follow the on-screen instructions to extract the file. Windows (using command prompt): Though this is a bit more complex, you won't need to install a third-party app. To do this: Press the Windows Key + the R key to open the Run dialog. Type cmd and click OK . Type cd Downloads and press Enter if the file is in your Downloads folder. If not, replace Downloads with the correct folder name (e.g., Desktop, Documents). Type tar -xvf FILENAME_export.tar , but replace FILENAME with the full name of the file. If you don't know the name, you can type dir and press Enter to see all of the files in the folder—the one you're looking for begins with \"8\" and usually follows the format \"8_live_yourname_export.tar\".
