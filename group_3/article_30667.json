      "title": "Find a tape measure.",
      "content": "Find a tape measure. You should use a flexible body tape measure, such as the type that a tailor would use. Do not use a retracting tape measure, like the ones used in construction or for measuring furniture. The tape should not stretch when pulled or bent. You can also use a string and a ruler. Wrap the string the same way you would a tape measure. Mark the length of the string used, and measure it against a ruler."
    },
    {
      "title": "Wrap the tape around the thickest part of your thigh.",
      "content": "Wrap the tape around the thickest part of your thigh. Stand with your legs straight. Find the thickest part of your thigh. This is your upper thigh, right under the buttocks. Start the tape at the front of your thigh and wrap it around towards the back before bringing it back to the front. Mark the number at the point where the tape measure meets itself."
    },
    {
      "title": "Pull the tape between your knee and your buttocks.",
      "content": "Pull the tape between your knee and your buttocks. If you need to measure the length of your thigh, start the tape at the back of your knee and pull it straight up along the back of your thigh. Mark the measurement just where your buttocks begin. You may need to have a friend do this measurement for you."
    },
    {
      "title": "Avoid holding the tape too tightly.",
      "content": "Avoid holding the tape too tightly. When measuring with a tape or string, the tape should press lightly against your skin, but you should not hold it so tightly that it sinks into your skin."
    },
    {
      "title": "Find a pair of calipers.",
      "content": "Find a pair of calipers. You will need a pair of skinfold calipers, also known as body fat calipers. These are sold in most fitness stores. These calipers may come with digital readers or analog dials. Calipers may sometimes give measurements that are higher than your actual body fat. A doctor or personal trainer may have more accurate methods of body fat measurements available, including water displacement methods, body fat scales, or DEXA scanning. [1] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Locate the midpoint of your thigh.",
      "content": "Locate the midpoint of your thigh. Find the midpoint between your knee and your hip on the front of your thigh. [2] X Research source You can roughly find this by stretching your hand with your pinky on the top of your knee and your thumb towards the middle of your thigh. You can also use a measuring tape to measure the length of your thigh and mark the halfway point. Once you find this spot, you may want to mark it with a felt-tipped pen so that you can remember it when you have the calipers ready."
    },
    {
      "title": "Bend your knee.",
      "content": "Bend your knee. For the best accuracy, you should bend your knee so that your leg forms a 90 degree angle. The best way to do this is to sit on a chair or bench. [3] X Research source You can also stand and bend back your knee, resting your foot behind you on a box or chair."

    {
      "title": "Pinch and pull the skin.",
      "content": "Pinch and pull the skin. Pinch the tissue so that you have a small vertical fold of skin. To do this, your fingers should be side by side as you pinch, not one over the other. As you grasp the tissue, gently tug it forward. [4] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Measure with calipers.",
      "content": "Measure with calipers. Press on the calipers to close the tips around the fold of your thigh. Release the handle when done. The calipers should be just below your fingers. The dial may rapidly swing before settling. Once, the dial has settled, read the measurements. If you do not have calipers, you may be able to get a rough measurement by measuring the distance between your fingers with a ruler. You may need a friend to help with this."

    {
      "title": "Use these measurements to calculate body fat.",
      "content": "Use these measurements to calculate body fat. If you are interested in the body fat percentage, you can calculate your overall body fat. You can use an online calculator to find a rough estimate of your overall body fat, or you can do the math yourself. If you're not interested in the percentage but just want to track how your thigh fat changes, write down the measurement, and keep track of it over time. [5] X Research source To use a formula, men should measure their body fat at their abs, chest, and thighs. Women should measure at their triceps, suprailiac, and thighs. There are many different formulas you can use to calculate body fat percentage, such as the Jackson and Pollack formula."

    {
      "title": "Ask a friend to help you.",
      "content": "Ask a friend to help you. While you may be able to do these measurements on your own, you will get more accurate numbers if you have a friend take the measurements for you. Bending over can affect the measurement if you're trying to do it alone, but if you have a friend take the measurement, you can stand or sit straight."
    },
    {
      "title": "Repeat measurements.",
      "content": "Repeat measurements. You may want to do these measurements a few times to make sure that you are repeatedly getting the same number. [6] X Research source If you are trying to track fitness progress, you should take measurements every two or three weeks. It may take a few measurements over several weeks to get an idea of your progress."
