To write your own simple .BAT file, you don't need special editing software - just Windows' basic Notepad program. Notepad can usually be found in the Start menu, or, alternatively, in the \"Accessories\" folder."

By default, .BAT files open up a command prompt window and display the commands being run. @echo off and CLS stop the commands in the command prompt window from appearing, making the processes that are taking place invisible to the user being pranked."

      "content": "Write a command to open multiple (or infinite) windows. Now, it's time to write a series of commands that will cause your fake virus to open either lots of program windows or an infinite amount of program windows. This is an important distinction - leaving a program running which opens an infinite amount of windows will eventually crash a computer. See below for instructions on making both kinds of \"virus\": To open a finite number of windows, start a new line and type the following command into your notepad window: start (program name here) . In place of the phrase of parentheses, put the name of a program on your computer or its precise file location. This command causes the computer to open a window of the program you specify. For example, start iexplore.exe will open a window of Internet Explorer. Repeat this \"start\" command as many times as you'd like - your \"virus\" will open a window for every time you repeat this command. Here are just a few ideas for programs you may want to enter after \"start\": iexplore.exe - Internet calc.exe - Calculator notepad.exe - Notepad winword.exe - Microsoft Word (tested with version 2013, may work with other versions) To open an infinite number of windows, first start a new line and type :A , including the colon. Then, in the line under that, type start iexplore.exe (or use some other program). Finally, in the line under that, type goto A . This will cause the computer to open a window of Internet Explorer (or whatever program you specified) and then immediately return to the point in the instructions before it opened the program, effectively causing it to open new windows until the command prompt is closed or the computer crashes."

To display a message, start a new line and type echo Your Message Here , typing your desired message where indicated. Then, start a new line and type pause . This causes your desired message to pop up in a command prompt window. To make your prank more believable, use a message that sounds like something your computer might actually display in the event of an error. For instance, you might try: Fatal Error. C:// directory corrupted."

One of the most sure-fire ways to trick someone into opening one is to create a shortcut of your batch file, then change its icon to something the user usually uses, then change the shortcut's name to match the new icon.

Type this command (including the parentheses and quotation marks), adding an appropriate error message and error title. This command opens a Windows error dialog box with your specified message in the body of the dialog and your specified title as the dialogue's header. To make your prank believable, try to use error messages and titles that sound like real ones. For instance, try \"Terminal Error\" as your error title and \"Critical fault detected at C://Users/Windows/system32\" as your error message. You might also want to go in a \"hacking\" direction by using a message like, \"I have total access to your system. Prepare to be hacked.\" This never actually happens in the event of actual hacking, so this will work best on people who don't know much about computers. The \"5+16\" in the command above tells the computer to create a dialog box with a critical icon and two buttons - \"Retry\" and \"Cancel.\" By changing the numbers, you can custom-create different error boxes. Simply swap out any of the single-digit numbers below for 5 and any of the double digit numbers below for 16: 0 (OK Button) 1 (OK and Cancel Buttons) 2 (Abort, Retry and Ignore Buttons) 3 (Yes, No, and Cancel Buttons) 4 (Yes and No Buttons) 5 (Retry and Cancel Buttonï»¿s) 16 (Critical Icon) 32 (Help Icon) 48 (Warning Icon) 64 (Information Icon)"

As an added bonus, once you understand how E-bombs work, you can start writing your own! Here is a list of the commands we used in this article, along with a brief description of each: @echo off - Turns command prompt comments off cls - Clears the command prompt screen. This just makes the command prompt appear neater. goto - Go to whatever flag you specify immediately after \"goto\". %random% - A windows variable that randomly generates a number between (and including) 0-9. :(number, letter, or word) - A flag. \"Goto\" commands send the program to whatever flag they specify. Note: in our example above, we have 10 flags. If we leave a number out, the program should close when %random% generates that number."
