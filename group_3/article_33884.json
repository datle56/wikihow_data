Then, put them into a large stockpot and pour in enough cold water to cover the cowpeas by 2 inches (5.1 cm). Leave the cowpeas to soak at room temperature for at least 8 hours. [1] X Research source It's fine to leave the cowpeas to soak overnight if you want to prep them the day before."

The beans will soften and absorb flavor as they simmer. [4] X Research source Stir the cowpeas occasionally during the cooking time so they don't stick to the bottom of the pot. If the beans soak up all of the water, add enough water to cover them until they're finished cooking."
