      "content": "Check if your computer is powerful enough to run Dolphin Emulator. Dolphin runs best on a 3 GHz or higher dual core processor, and with a graphics card that supports the latest version of DirectX or OpenGL. Graphics cards manufactured by ATI or NVIDIA are recommended. Integrated graphics cards (like the Intel HD series) are not recommended. If you have a powerful CPU but an integrated graphics card, you still might be able to achieve decent speeds by tweaking the settings (see below). A 64 bit CPU with a 64 bit operating system is also recommended, because they can address more memory and perform faster calculations. If possible, use Windows, because Dolphin's DirectX is faster than OpenGL."
