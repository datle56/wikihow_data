      "content": "Select vibrant leaves. Harvest freshly fallen leaves that are bright in color and fairly supple. The leaves can be somewhat dry, but they should not be so dry that they are brittle or turning up at the ends. Avoid leaves with rips or rotten spots. Your leaves are going to lose some color when you dry them out, so the brighter your leaves are when you select them, the less noticeable this loss of color will be when youâ€™re done.

      "content": "Coat both sides of each leaf in decoupage. Decoupage is a white, gluey substance that turns clear when it dries. You can find it at your local craft store. Use a foam brush to carefully apply a liberal coat of decoupage to one side of each leaf. Set them to dry on a piece of newspaper. In most cases, you should apply the decoupage to the leaves the same day you collect them. If you wait too long, the leaves will dry out, becoming brown and brittle. If the leaves are very moist, however, or if you plucked them directly off the tree instead of waiting for them to drop, you can dry them out slightly by pressing them in between the pages of a heavy book for a few days."

Melt it in a disposable cake pan by heating the pan on your stove over low heat. [2] X Research source To make the paraffin wax melt more quickly, slice it into thick chunks and spread them evenly along the bottom of the disposable pan. If you do not use a disposable pan, use a cake pan that you do not plan on using for cooking anymore. The wax can ruin the pan, so you should not use a pan that you frequently use for cooking and baking."

      "content": "Lay the leaves out to dry. Lay each wax-covered leaf out on wax paper until the wax hardens. Let the leaves dry in a draft-free area for several hours. Once dried, they should lift off the wax paper easily. This method preserves the form and color of the leaves for a long time. [4] X Research source To be extra safe, line the counters with newsprint before lining them with a layer of wax paper. The double layer minimizes the risk of getting wax drippings on the counter. If they get on the counter, wax drippings can be extremely difficult to scrape off."

      "content": "Select fresh leaves or a small branch with leaves attached. If you would like to preserve an entire branch of fall leaves, this preservation method is easier to use than wax. Choose a branch with leaves that are vibrant and firmly attached. [5] X Research source This method will make the colors more vibrant. Yellows become more intense, and reds and oranges become a vibrant ruddy color. Look for sprigs that have fallen off the tree on their own instead of breaking them off the tree yourself. Removing a branch from a tree can damage it. Do not choose branches that have diseased leaves or those that have gone through a frost. This method does not work on leaves that have already gone through a frost."

      "content": "Open up the end of each branch. Strike the end of each branch with a hammer to split it open, exposing the live portion of the wood. This exposes the live wood of the branch so that it can absorb the glycerin solution properly. Otherwise, the solution will not be able to reach the leaves. If you're just preserving individual leaves, you can skip this step."

To make a solution, add 17 oz (530 ml) of liquid vegetable glycerin to half a gallon (2 liters) of water in a large bucket or vase. [6] X Research source Glycerin is a natural product derived from vegetables, making this a fairly organic option to preserve your leaves. If you're preserving a large, woody branch, mix in four to five drops of mild liquid dish soap. The dish soap acts as a surfactant, breaking the surface tension of the glycerin so that the molecules can penetrate the wood more easily. For best results, use a mild dish soap with no added colors or scents. You could also use liquid surfactant, which is available at most gardening stores."

Store the bucket in a shaded place during the absorption process. [7] X Research source If you're preserving individual leaves, you'll need to weigh them so they stay submerged. Pour the solution into a flat pan, place the leaves in the solution, and cover them with a plate or lid to hold them down."

Cover them with another single layer of paper towel. Use freshly fallen leaves that are still vibrant and pliable. Avoid leaves that are curling at the ends or those that have rips or rotted spots. For best results, leave a little space in between each leaf to prevent them from sticking together as they dry."

[9] X Research source Autumn leaves will generally need to be microwaved 30 to 180 seconds before they are sufficiently dry. Be very attentive when microwaving leaves. If cooked too long, leaves can actually catch fire. Leaves that appear scorched have been microwaved too long. Leaves that curl at the ends after being removed from the microwave have not been microwaved long enough."

Sandwich your fall leaves in between two clean sheets of heavy white typing paper. [11] X Research source Use paper that is at least as heavy as typing paper, rather than something thin like tracing paper. Otherwise, the leaves may bleed through and create stains. Lay the leaves out in a single layer. Do not stack or overlap the leaves since doing so will cause them to stick together. Choose leaves that are in good shape.

Simply tuck the leaves away into the pages of the book. Allow at least 20 pages in between leaves for best results. [12] X Research source Telephone directories work very well, if you have one available. Put weight on top of the book. The pressing helps press out moisture as well as keep the leaf flat.

Make sure they aren't overlapping, since this will cause the leaves to stick together. Use a medium-hot iron to iron each side. Iron each side for three to five minutes to absorb extra moisture. Drying the leaves out beforehand will allow them to retain their color and quality after being sealed into the wax paper. Do not use a steam setting on your iron, since steam will keep the leaves moist. Only use a dry setting. Feel the leaves after ironing them for 3 to 5 minutes. If a leaf does not feel dry, iron both sides for a few more minutes."

Carefully cut around each leaf using scissors or a sharp craft blade. Leave a small border of wax paper around the edge of each leaf so that the leaf remains securely sealed in between the layers of wax paper. You could also try to peel the wax paper off the leaves instead of cutting them out. A coating of wax should remain on the leaves, and it may be enough to keep the leaves well preserved."
