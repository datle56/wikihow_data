      "content": "Plan your bake sale. First, determine how many treats you plan to sell. If you just want to go round the neighbourhood, then you will need around 50-70 treats. For a class sale, around 15-40. For a whole school sale, around 100-150. Also, don't forgetâ€”if it's not a bake sale and more of baking orders, get all the orders in first! [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Plan the prices. Don't rip your customers off (or you might not get any), by selling a cookie for $5. Sell your treats at reasonable prices e.g. Cupcake=$2 Cookie=$1 But try not to make them too cheap, or you won't make as much money. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Plan the date. Use a normal day, where people won't be busy or away. Also, use a sensible time, e.g. after school, or 4:00 PM in the neighbourhood. Remember to ask your principal if you can hold your bake sale! [4] X Research source"
