      "content": "Press the Reset button once. Your carbon monoxide alarm may have a separate Test button or a joint “Test/Reset” button on its front panel. Push the button down to reset the carbon monoxide detector and shut off the alarm. Some models might also have an LED light that flashes next to the button to confirm you’ve reset it. [1] X Research source Always check the user manual for the specific carbon monoxide detector model you have since the instructions may vary. For example, you may need to hold the button down for 5–10 seconds to fully reset it. Some carbon monoxide detectors automatically reset. After the alarm has gone off for about 5–10 minutes, it will turn off by itself."

Whether the alarm goes off during an emergency, beeps during a test, or chirps due to a low battery, the Reset button will help silence it temporarily. [2] X Research source If the alarm ever turns back on within 5 minutes of pressing the Reset button, then there’s a high concentration of carbon monoxide in the area. Get to fresh air immediately to avoid carbon monoxide poisoning."
