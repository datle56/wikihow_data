[2] X Research source Some native Khmer speakers render it \"knhom srolanh nak.\" [3] X Research source \"Knhom\" (also rendered \"khnhom\" or \"kyom\" or \" is the word you use for \"I\" if you want it to be gender-neutral or generic. Pronounce it \"ken-yooom.\" \"Nak\" is the word you use for \"you\" if you want it to be gender-neutral or generic. The \"k\" is very subtle (almost imperceptible): say it like \"naHk\""

Regardless of whether you are male or female, or if the object of your affection is male or female, \"love\" is pronounced the same way. One common way to phonetically render the Khmer word for \"love\" is \"srolang.\" Another way is \"srolahn.\" As you say the \"r,\" slightly roll it with your tongue; the \"g\" falls off the end and is almost imperceptible (which is why some renderings leave it off altogether). To some English speakers, the word \"srolahn\" is reminiscent of the German word \"Fräulein,\" which means \"Miss.\""

It is similar to other southeast Asian languages such as Vietnamese and Mon, [6] X Research source and has a beautiful flowing script. If you know much about Asian language systems, you'll know that this means that Khmer, both in print and spoken aloud, is very different from the English alphabet system. The Khmer alphabet is alphasyllabic, meaning that each letter represents a syllable rather than one sound like in English. [7] X Research source It is written from left to right, with no spaces between words in a given sentence. Khmer contains 33 consonant letters, 14 independent vowels, and 21 vowel diacritics (essentially an accent mark written above or below a letter that changes the way it is pronounced). [8] X Research source None of these letters are similar to English, which can make it hard to learn for native English speakers."
