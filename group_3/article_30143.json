If your child likes playing cowboys or armies, this would be a great birthday or Christmas present. You can make the gun a more realistic toy by adding a \"trigger.\" Glue a wooden clothespin under the \"barrel\" of the toy gun, making sure that the shorter \"clip\" end is pointed outward. Later, your child can even stretch a rubber band from the clothes pin to the end of the gun's \"barrel,\" releasing and \"shooting\" the rubber band by opening the clothespin \"trigger.\" [1] X Research source"

Choose a wood such as pine that is soft enough to carve, but tough enough to be a durable toy. You can even try to find a board with a natural grain suitable for a gun's stock."

Carefully use a router to cut a groove along this line for the dowel barrel. The groove should be just wide enough to set the dowel in it. Run a bead of wood glue down the groove and position the dowel in groove."
