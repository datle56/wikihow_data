      "content": "Understand the pros and cons of quitting cold turkey. Quitting cold turkey means deciding to quit smoking completely without the help of nicotine replacement therapy or drugs. This requires perseverance and independence. Only 3-10% of people have been able to successfully quit smoking cold turkey because of the drastic change this makes in their lives. Before you try quitting cold turkey, you should understand the advantages and disadvantages of the process. Advantages : If you have to quit because you have a serious health problem as a result of your smoking, quitting cold turkey will be the quickest way to improve your health or to keep it from further deteriorating. You will also be more motivated to do it on your own if you have a serious health risk. You may feel more pain, but you'll feel it for a shorter amount of time. Instead of spending months or even a year dealing with medication and nicotine therapy and slowly weaning your body off nicotine, you will be able to conquer your addiction more quickly if you do succeed. Disadvantages : You may experience intense and unpleasant withdrawal symptoms, such as depression, insomnia, irritability, and anxiety. You have less of a chance of success if you quit cold turkey than if you try to use a combination of other methods."

After you've had a relapse, whether it was just bumming one cigarette at a party or smoking an entire pack during a rough day, it's time to sit back and ask yourself why it happened.

Here are some questions you should ask yourself: [11] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source Did you have a relapse because you were feeling stressed? If so, you should think more about how you can minimize your stress, or avoid particularly stressful situations. For example, if you had a cigarette because of a stressful day at work, find a way to deal with another stressful day at work, such as having ice cream or watching your favorite movie after work instead. Did you have a relapse because you were in a situation that made you want to smoke? If you had a cigarette at your friend Beth's party because you associate her parties with having a nice cool smoke on the back porch, then you should either avoid her parties for a while or come equipped with gum, a dessert, or a game plan for beating the craving. What were you feeling right before you relapsed? Recognizing those feelings can help you fight them in the future."
