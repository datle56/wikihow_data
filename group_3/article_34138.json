      "title": "Place large rocks on top.",
      "content": "Place large rocks on top. If you place big rocks on top of the soil all around the plant, then the cat can't get to the soil. You can still water around the rocks. Plus, you can just pick up rocks from outside if you have some in your backyard."

      "title": "Cover the soil with aluminum foil.",
      "content": "Cover the soil with aluminum foil. To prevent the cat from digging in the soil, cover the soil with aluminum or tin foil. Wrap it tightly around the top of the planter or pot, but leave a little room around the stem or stalk of the plant so air can reach the soil."

      "title": "Create a tower of cups to startle the cat.",
      "content": "Create a tower of cups to startle the cat. An easy way to keep a cat away from plants is to build a tower of plastic cups in front of it. When your cat tries to reach the plant, the tower will topple, giving the cat a fright. Once the cat's been startled a couple of times, it will likely leave the plants alone."

      "title": "Hang plants up.",
      "content": "Hang plants up. Hanging plants are much more difficult for your cat to get to, particularly if they're not near a tall structure (such as a bookcase). If your cat can't get to the plant, it can't dig in it."

      "title": "Gather your plants together.",
      "content": "Gather your plants together. If you don't leave a space on the flat surface for the cat to jump on to, it may not climb into the plants. Try crowding several plants together on a windowsill, for instance. [1] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Crowd out the soil.",
      "content": "Crowd out the soil. Start by making sure the plant is in a pot that's not too big for it, as that leaves space for a cat to dig. If the pot is too big, you can use the rock trick or you can even place other plants with their small pots on the soil of the big plant, leaving little room for your cat to get in. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Use a plastic scat mat.",
      "content": "Use a plastic scat mat. A plastic scat mat is a mat with spikes that stick up. You place it on the soil to keep the cats out. However, don't worry; the spikes are flexible, and they won't actually hurt your cat. They're just annoying enough to keep your cat out of the soil. [3] X Research source You may need to cut mats to fit your plants."

    {
      "title": "Make the surface around the plant sticky.",
      "content": "Make the surface around the plant sticky. This trick only works if you have open space around the base of the pot. You add fly paper or two-sided tape to the surface, and the cat won't want to walk on the area (since cats don't like the feeling of it on their paws). [4] X Research source When you try this method out, be sure to supervise the cat in case it gets the tape or fly paper stuck to it. Be sure to remove the tape or flypaper from the cat, as leaving it there can stress out the cat."

      "title": "Place mothballs in the soil.",
      "content": "Place mothballs in the soil. Cats don't appreciate the smell of mothballs, so placing them in your houseplant's soil may keep your cat out of it. It won't harm the plant, either. Just press them into the soil in several places."

      "title": "Break up old scented candles.",
      "content": "Break up old scented candles. Now you have a great use for the ends of old scented candles. Just break them into pieces, and push them into the soil. The smell will keep the cats away, but it won't harm the plant. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Try citrus or lavender.",
      "content": "Try citrus or lavender. You can also spray the area with a lavender or citrus smell, which your cat won't like. Citronella may also work. You will have to respray from time to time. You can also add citrus peels or lavender flowers to the soil, which may also keep your at bay. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Make sure the cat is entertained.",
      "content": "Make sure the cat is entertained. Some cats dig because they are bored and they have nothing else to play with. Others may feel lonely. Find toys your cat enjoys, so it won't mess with your houseplants. Also, play with your cat for about 30 minutes a day, broken up in two or three sessions. Your cat might like jingle ball toys or scrunchy toys. However, your cat may be equally happy with a cardboard box. When playing with your cat, lure toys are usually a good bet. Make sure you supervise your cat if you let them play with a string toys. Strings can be very dangerous if your cat swallows one."

      "title": "Give your cat supervised outdoor time.",
      "content": "Give your cat supervised outdoor time. Some cats who dig in houseplants benefit from spending some time outside. However, you don't want to just suddenly let an indoor cat outside, particularly if the cat is declawed. You should supervise the cat on a harness and leash. [7] X Research source To get your cat used to a harness and leash, start by placing the harness on the cat around the house. Begin with short periods, and work up to longer periods. When the cat is used to the harness, you can try taking it outside on a leash."

      "content": "Use a cat deterrent spray to teach the cat to stay away from plants. Deterrents, like SSSCAT deterrent spray, are motion-activated and will spray an odorless, stainless stream that startles the cat when their presence is detected. Simply place the bottle near the plants that the cat has been digging up. After a few sprays, the cat will likely learn to stay away from your houseplants."
