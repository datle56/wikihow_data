      "content": "Incorporate short direct quotes into a sentence. A short quote is anything that is shorter than 4 typed lines. When you use a short quote, include it directly in your paragraph, along with your own words. To help the reader understand the quote and why you're using it, write a full sentence that includes the quote, rather than just lifting a sentence from another work and putting it into your paper. [1] X Research source For instance, let's say this is the quote you want to use: \"The brown leaves symbolize the death of their relationship, while the green buds suggest new opportunities will soon unfold.\" If you just type that sentence into your essay and put quotes around it, your reader will be disoriented. Instead, you could incorporate it into a sentence like this: \"The imagery in the story mirrors what's happening in Lia's love life, as 'The brown leaves symbolize the death of their relationship, while the green buds suggest new opportunities will soon unfold.'\""

      "title": "Use a lead-in to introduce the quote.",
      "content": "Use a lead-in to introduce the quote. The lead in provides some context to the quote. It lets the reader know that you're presenting evidence or support, as well as where that support comes from. In many cases, you'll use the author's name, but this isn't always necessary. Here are some examples of how to introduce a short quote: [2] X Research source \"Critic Alex Li says, 'The frequent references to the color blue are used to suggest that the family is struggling to cope with the loss of their matriarch.'\" \"According to McKinney’s research, 'Adults who do yoga at least three times a week have lower blood pressure, better sleeping patterns, and fewer everyday frustrations.'\" \"Based on several recent studies, people are more likely to sit on the park benches when they're shaded by trees.\""

      "title": "Put quotation marks around the direct quote.",
      "content": "Put quotation marks around the direct quote. Use quotation marks anytime you include someone else's words in your own paper. This lets the reader know that you have borrowed from another writer. As long as you use quotation marks and cite the source where you got the material, you can use someone else's ideas without plagiarizing. [3] X Research source You still need to use quotation marks even if you're only quoting a few words. If you're in doubt, it's best to be cautious and use quotes."

    {
      "title": "Provide commentary after a quote to explain how it supports your ideas.",
      "content": "Provide commentary after a quote to explain how it supports your ideas. A quote doesn’t support your ideas unless you analyze it and link it back to your thesis. After the quote, write 1-3 sentences explaining what the quote means, why it supports your topic sentence, and how it supports your argument overall. [4] X Research source For example, let’s say you used the quote, “According to McKinney’s research, ‘Adults who do yoga at least three times a week have lower blood pressure, better sleeping patterns, and fewer everyday frustrations.’” Your commentary might read, “This shows that yoga can have a positive impact on people’s health, so incorporating it into the workplace can help improve employee health outcomes. Since yoga makes employees healthier, they’ll likely have reduced insurance costs.”"

      "title": "Paraphrase",
      "content": "Paraphrase the quote if you can restate the author's ideas in your own words. Paraphrasing is when you restate someone else’s ideas in your own words. It’s a great way to incorporate evidence into your paper without using a direct quote every time. Although you don’t need to use quotes around a paraphrase, you do need to cite it. [5] X Research source When you use a paraphrase, you still need to provide commentary that links the paraphrased material back to your thesis and ideas."

      "content": "Introduce a long direct quote, then set it off in a block. A long quote is anything that’s longer than 4 typed lines. You’ll present these quotes in a block of text set off from the rest of your paragraph. Because the quote is set off in a block, you don’t need to put quotation marks around it. [6] X Research source The reader will recognize that the material is a direct quote because it's set off from the rest of the text. That's why you don't need to use quotation marks. However, you will include your citation at the bottom."

For a block quote, your lead in will be an entire sentence that explains what the reader should understand after reading the block quote. At the end of this sentence, put a colon. Then, put your block quote. This is how you would lead into a block quote: [7] X Research source \"In The Things They Carried , the items carried by soldiers in the Vietnam war are used to both characterize them and burden the readers with the weight they are carrying: The things they carried were largely determined by necessity. Among the necessities or near-necessities were P-38 can openers, pocket knives, heat tabs, wristwatches, dog tags, mosquito repellent, chewing gum, candy cigarettes, salt tablets, packets of Kool-Aid, lighters, matches, sewing kits, Military Payment Certificates, C rations, and two or three canteens of water.\" (O'Brien 2)"

Make sure your entire quote is indented so that your reader will recognize that it's set off from the rest of the text. [8] X Research source Your block quote will use the same spacing as the rest of your paper, which will likely be double-spacing."

      "title": "Use an ellipsis to omit a word or words from a direct quote.",
      "content": "Use an ellipsis to omit a word or words from a direct quote. Sometimes you want to shorten a quote to help your reader better understand why it supports your argument. Similarly, you may want to cut out words that aren’t essential to the quote’s meaning. To cut out a word or words, you just need to put an ellipsis (...) in place of the words. [9] X Trustworthy Source Purdue Online Writing Lab Trusted resource for writing and citation guidelines Go to source For example, “According to Li, “Rosa is the first sister to pick a rose because she’s the only one who’s begun to move on after their mother’s death” might become “According to Li, “Rosa is the first sister to pick a rose because she’s … begun to move on after their mother’s death.” Don’t eliminate words to change the meaning of the original text. For instance, it’s not appropriate to use an ellipsis to change “plants did not grow faster when exposed to poetry” to “plants did … grow faster when exposed to poetry.”"

      "content": "Put brackets around words you need to add to a quote for clarification. Sometimes you need to add a word or words to a quote in order for your reader to understand it. This can help you explain pronouns used in the direct quote or further explain what a quote is referencing. Brackets allow you to add or replace words, as long as you don’t change the meaning of the text. [10] X Research source For example, let’s say you want to use the quote, “All of them experienced a more relaxed, calmer disposition after doing yoga for 6 months.” This doesn’t tell the reader who you’re talking about. You could use brackets to say, “All of [the teachers in the study] experienced a more relaxed, calmer disposition after doing yoga for 6 months.” However, if you know the study is talking about teachers, you couldn’t use brackets to say, “All of [society experiences] a more relaxed, calmer disposition after doing yoga for 6 months.”"

      "title": "Provide commentary after a quote to explain how it supports your ideas.",
      "content": "Provide commentary after a quote to explain how it supports your ideas. A block quote requires more commentary than a short quote. At a minimum, write 2-3 sentences analyzing the quote and linking it back to your thesis. However, you may need to provide longer commentary to fully explain the quote to your reader. [11] X Research source If you don't explain your quote well, then it's not helping your ideas. You can't expect the reader to connect the quote back to your thesis for you."

      "content": "Paraphrase the quote to condense it to 1 or 2 sentences, if you can. Paraphrasing is a great way to avoid using a long quote in your paper. Unless the author's original words are necessary to make your point, rewrite the passage in your own words. Try to condense the original author's ideas into 1 or 2 sentences that support your argument . Then, incorporate your paraphrase into your paragraph, without using quotation marks. However, do include a citation to let your reader know where you found those ideas. [12] X Research source For instance, you may prefer to use a long block quote to present a passage from a literary work that demonstrates the author's style. However, let's say you were using a journal article to provide a critic's perspective on an author's work. You may not need to directly quote an entire paragraph word-for-word to get their point across. Instead, use a paraphrase."
