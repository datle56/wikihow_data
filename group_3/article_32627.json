Blue perm rods are the next size up and are 2–3 inches (5.1–7.6 cm). Pink perm rods are 2.5–4 inches (6.4–10.2 cm)."

After you get out of the shower, comb through your hair with a wide-toothed comb. A comb is gentler on damp hair and can get out any of the remaining tangles in your hair. [6] X Research source"
