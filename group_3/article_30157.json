      "content": "Choose a dense, hard wood to make your xylophone keys with. The dense and sturdier the wood is, the clearer your sound will be. Your xylophone will also be more resistant to scratches and dings if made from a hard piece of wood. [1] X Research source Rosewood is recommended as an ideal and traditional wood for xylophones. Cedar wood, cardinal wood and purple heartwood are also popular choices. [2] X Research source"

Always keep your hands at least 6 in (15 cm) from the blade to prevent injury. In terms of length, your xylophone keys should match the following measurements. [3] X Research source 9.875 in (25.08 cm) 9.75 in (24.8 cm) 8.63 in (21.9 cm) 8.31 in (21.1 cm) 8.06 in (20.5 cm) 7.75 in (19.7 cm) 7.43 in (18.9 cm) 6.81 in (17.3 cm) 6.43 in (16.3 cm)"

      "content": "Mark where you will attach the keys to the xylophone box. You will need to attach the key about 1/5 of the way above or below one of the ends. Mark the spots where you will attach the keys with a piece of chalk, then mark the other side of the xylophone key at about 1/5 of the way from the end. [4] X Research source Repeat this process with all of your keys. To test the spot that you're planning to attach the key, hit it with a xylophone mallet while holding it with your fingers in that spot. If your key produces a clear sound, you've chosen a good spot."

      "content": "Purchase plywood, pine, or hardwood for the xylophone box. Because the xylophone box does not need to resonate, you have more flexibility with what wood you use to make it with. If you choose plywood, look for 5- or 7-ply furniture grade plywood with a thin laminate to give your xylophone a strong finish. [7] X Research source"

Make sure all 5 pieces fit together before gluing them. If they don't, make adjustments with your table saw or power tool until they fit neatly. [9] X Research source When you've finished cutting the wood, sand it down to smooth out rough edges. [10] X Research source If your box has too many gaps between the sides, it will interfere with your xylophone's resonation."

Space the blocks about 1 in (2.5 cm) apart, and adhere them to the board with wood glue. Let the wood glue dry before continuing to build your xylophone. On average wood glue takes about 6-8 hours to dry, but check its packaging for specific details."
