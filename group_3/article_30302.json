      "content": "Bring the left and right corners in about halfway to the center, folding the top. Fold each of the 2 corners on either side of the crease in halfway to the middle to form the wings, which will look like small triangles at the upper half of the paper. Line up the edges of the folds so that they’re parallel with the center crease. [2] X Research source Try to fold the left and right corners the same amount on both sides so that the wings are even."

      "content": "Fold the top corner down to the middle of the paper. Bring the top corner down to make the head of the owl. Crease it so that the tip of the corner hits the exact center of the paper. [3] X Research source Line up the corner with the bottom of the wings when you fold it down."

      "content": "Fold the corner back up to the top, crease it, then fold the tip halfway down. To make the head of the owl, bring the corner in the center up towards you so it lines up with the top edge and crease the fold. Then, fold the corner back down about halfway to create the beak. [4] X Research source Bring the corner down past the bottom edge of the head when you’re making the beak."

Bring the bottom corner up, aligning it with the flat edge at the top of the owl before creasing it.

Crease it so it stays in place, forming the tail. [6] X Research source If you don’t fold the corner down past the edge, you won’t be able to see the owl’s tail from the front."

Once you turn the paper to the other side, fold it in half by bringing one edge over to the opposite edge. Open it back up and then fold the other 2 edges together.

As you do so, the paper will automatically collapse onto itself along the creases you made previously. Press down with the palm of your hand to crease the folds so you end up with a flat diamond shape.

Fold down the top of the paper so that you crease it along the straight edge formed by the left and right edges. Then, open your last 3 folds so you’re back to the small diamond shape.

Fold the left and right edges into the middle, then fold the top down. Unfold the paper to the small diamond, then open the top flap and flattening the left and right sides. [13] X Research source Check that the shape formed on this side perfectly matches the shape formed on the other side. If they aren’t aligned on top of each other, adjust your folds on the backside."

Twist them about 90 degrees so the flat piece is facing you. Then use your palm to press down on the twist to flatten and crease it. [16] X Research source Be patient with yourself! This is a tricky step so you may need to try twisting the wings a couple times before you get them to lay flat out to the sides. Even out the wings so they both point straight out at 90 degree angles from the middle of the owl."

Bring the top corner of both layers down together, creasing it once the corner is in the middle of the kite. Then, pull the tip back up past the top edge created by the crease to form the beak. [17] X Research source If you have trouble creasing the paper since it's so thick at this point, use a pencil or other object to help you press down on the fold to crease it."
