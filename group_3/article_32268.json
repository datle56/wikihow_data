      "content": "Remove the rust on the shed. There are a number of methods that can be used. Choose depending upon available materials and the quantity of rust. [3] X Research source Buy a wire brush attachment for your power drill, if you have rust patches, instead of rust all over the shed. Employ a belt sander and orbital sander to remove rust on many surfaces and corners. Use fine grit sandpaper so that you do not damage the integrity of weakened surfaces. Most people who are repainting metal sheds will need to do some sanding. Although you can sand by hand, it will save time by using power tools. Rent a hand held sandblaster for big jobs. This device uses compressed air to blow fine sand over the surface of the shed. It has the same effect of sanding, but is very efficient. Make sure to lay drop cloths over plants and objects. Sandblasting is extremely effective for metal scroll work and smaller, hard to reach surfaces, as well as long flat surfaces. Use a combination of any of the above methods according to what is the most effective. Remember that areas with auto body filler will also need to be sanded to ensure the paint will stick to the surface."
