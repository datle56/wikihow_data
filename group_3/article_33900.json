      "title": "Choose high-quality fruits.",
      "content": "Choose high-quality fruits. Look for fruits that are ripe and don't have blemishes or bruises. Since goldfish enjoy variety, pick out several kinds and see what they like to eat. For example, buy: [1] X Research source Apples Bananas and plantains Raspberries and strawberries Oranges Pears Grapes Mangoes"

      "title": "Buy vegetables that are high in fiber.",
      "content": "Buy vegetables that are high in fiber. Fiber will improve your goldfish's digestion and prevent constipation. Look for vegetables that are firm and heavy without blemishes or wilted spots. You can feed your goldfish: [2] X Research source Lettuce and spinach Sweet potatoes and potatoes Pumpkin Cauliflower, broccoli, and cabbage Zucchini Carrots Cucumbers Lima beans and peas"

      "title": "Submerge leafy or delicate produce in a bowl of cold water.",
      "content": "Submerge leafy or delicate produce in a bowl of cold water. If the produce has a large surface area or is leafy, put it into a bowl and fill the bowl with cold water. Leave the produce for 1 to 2 minutes and then swish it around to loosen any dirt or debris. Then drain the produce and rinse it under cold running water. [3] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Rinse the produce",
      "content": "Rinse the produce to remove dirt and pesticides. Wash your hands before you begin. If you're cleaning produce that has a rough surface, such as potatoes, carrots, or apples, scrub them gently under cold running water to remove any dirt. If you're rinsing small produce, such as strawberries, raspberries, or grapes, put them in a colander and rinse them under cold running water. [4] X Research source To help scrub the produce, you can use your fingers or purchase a vegetable scrubbing brush."
    },
    {
      "title": "Dry the produce completely.",
      "content": "Dry the produce completely. Prevent chlorine from the tap water that you used to rinse the produce from getting into the goldfish tank. To do this, use a paper towel to dry the cleaned produce. Then discard the paper towel and prepare the produce. [5] X Research source If you're still concerned about transferring chlorine to the tank, use distilled water instead of tap water to clean the produce."
    },
    {
      "title": "Peel the clean fruits and vegetables.",
      "content": "Peel the clean fruits and vegetables. The goldfish will need very soft food, so you'll have to remove the peel from most vegetables. You can chop and use soft food immediately or peel and heat harder produce. If you can't use a vegetable peel, take a paring knife and peel away the outer layer from: Apples Pears Grapes Mangoes Sweet potatoes and potatoes Pumpkin Zucchini Carrots Cucumbers"
    },
    {
      "title": "Steam",
      "content": "Steam the produce on the stovetop for 3 to 5 minutes. Heat about 1 inch (2.5 cm) of water in a pot until it comes to a boil. Then place a steamer basket into the pot and roughly chop the produce. Add it to the steamer basket. Then cover and steam the vegetables and fruit until they're tender when you poke them with a fork. [6] X Research source If you'd rather blanch the produce, add the fruits and vegetables directly to the boiling water in the pot. Boil the produce for 1 minute and then transfer it to a bowl of ice water to stop it from cooking. Ensure that the steamer basket doesn't touch the water in the pot."

    {
      "title": "Use the microwave if you don't want to steam on the stovetop.",
      "content": "Use the microwave if you don't want to steam on the stovetop. If you'd rather use the microwave, cut your choice of fruits and vegetables into chunks that are less than 2 inches (5.1 cm) in size. Put them into a microwave-safe container and pour in enough water to come 1 ‚ÅÑ 8 inch (0.32 cm) up the sides. Cover the container and microwave the produce until it's tender when you poke it with a fork. [7] X Research source If the produce isn't as soft as you'd like, cover and microwave it in 30-second increments."

    {
      "title": "Chop the produce into tiny pieces.",
      "content": "Chop the produce into tiny pieces. Since fish have very small mouths and no stomach, you'll need to make the produce as small as possible. Set the already soft or cooked produce on a clean cutting board and use a knife to chop the fruit or vegetables into pieces that are 1 mm (0.10 cm) to 2 mm (0.20 cm) in size. [8] X Research source To save time, put the food into a food processor and pulse it until it's finely chopped."
    },
    {
      "title": "Feed the goldfish the finely chopped produce.",
      "content": "Feed the goldfish the finely chopped produce. Scatter some of the prepared fruits or vegetables into the tank with your goldfish. If you're only feeding 1 or 2 fish, just add a few tiny pieces. For a tank full of goldfish, add a few spoonfuls. The fish will immediately begin to nibble at the food. Although goldfish can eat fruit, you should limit their fruit intake to 2 times a week and feed the vegetables once every day or two. The goldfish may not eat as many pellets or flakes, so consider cutting back on the dried food a little. If you'd like to store the prepared fruits and vegetables, put them into an airtight storage container and refrigerate them for up to 3 days. Keep in mind that some produce will become brown or soften over time."
