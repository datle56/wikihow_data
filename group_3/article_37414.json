      "content": "The 🍆 (eggplant) emoji usually refers to a penis. [1] X Research source It’s super commonly used for sexting, so if you’ve received an eggplant emoji, look out for other sexual emojis and phrases to help you decide if it's part of a dirty text. Because of the eggplant’s scorching associations, it was banned from major social media sites—but it’s still commonly used in private conversations. If the eggplant is sent with sexual text or emojis, then it’s referring to a man’s penis: “You make me so hot 👅💦🍆🍆.” If it’s sent along with info on gardening or salads, it probably refers to a literal eggplant in a non-dirty context: “My salad today is so delish. 🍆🥦🫑”"
