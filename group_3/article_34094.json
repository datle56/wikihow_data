      "title": "Harvest branches in February or March.",
      "content": "Harvest branches in February or March. This is when the catkins—those little fuzzy nodes that give the pussy willow its name—are either opened or about to open. Harvesting earlier in the year will give you closed, scaly catkins that will open once you bring them indoors, while waiting for early spring will yield pre-opened catkins ready for display. [1] X Research source Both male and female pussy willow trees produce buds, but only the buds of male trees produce furry flowers. Female flowers are also lovely (with a green and yellow network of small flowers), but harvest after the buds have bloomed if you want to be sure to get the right flower."

      "content": "Use pruning shears to harvest branches that are at least 0.5 in (1.3 cm) thick. In addition, cut only branches that are at least 12–18 in (30–46 cm) long, and cut at the base of the branch. [2] X Research source This ensures that younger branches are left to grow and mature for harvesting next year. It also ensures that your cut branches are hardy and can be grown or preserved for extended periods."

      "title": "Submerge the ends of the branches in water for 3-4 days.",
      "content": "Submerge the ends of the branches in water for 3-4 days. Fill a bucket or a vase with cool water, insert the branches, then keep them wherever you like. During this time, the willow branches will drink water and change appearance as they would in the wild, opening their buds and greening in color. This will take varying amounts of time depending on how soon in the season you harvested them, but branches harvested with swelling buds will turn within a few days. The cool conditions of a garage or shed are ideal, since they imitate the natural, chilly environment of the willow, but it’s also perfectly fine to keep them within your home for display while you wait. If you’ve harvested your branches while they’re already at their desired appearance, skip this step and go straight to drying."

      "title": "Dry the branches in bundles for 2-3 weeks.",
      "content": "Dry the branches in bundles for 2-3 weeks. Once the willow branches have turned and their buds have bloomed while in the water (or they reach an appearance to your liking), remove them from the water. Then, bundle them into groups of 5-10 branches and place them in a cool, dry place for 2-3 weeks, or until the branches have thoroughly dried. [3] X Trustworthy Source Penn State Extension Educational organization dedicated to delivering science-based information to people, businesses, and communities Go to source Dried pussy willow branches will darken in color, and won’t have any sap present when snipped a few inches from their base. Preserved branches will stay nice and home-ready for 3-4 years."

This is a ready-made, zero-fuss bit of home decor that will add a fresh touch of Spring to any room. Or, place the case outside on a porch or a walkway as a nice garden accent.

Then, dip a paintbrush in water and rub the brush in the scribbled chalk, as you would paint. Gently brush the chalk paint into the pussy willow blooms to dye them festive colors, and arrange the dyed branches in a vase for display. [5] X Research source"

Then, use wire to attach the bundles to a wreath frame, adjusting and adding bundles until the wreath appears full. Hang the wreath on your front door or above a mantle to add a cozy Spring vibe to your home. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Keep pussy willow branches in water until they form roots. If you prefer to propagate your branches rather than dry them, keep them in their container of water for about 3 weeks, or until they begin to form root systems. Pussy willows take root remarkably easily, even when kept in sparse conditions, like a bucket of water. [7] X Trustworthy Source Penn State Extension Educational organization dedicated to delivering science-based information to people, businesses, and communities Go to source If you’re storing the branches for extended periods before planting, place the cut end of the branches in a plastic bag filled with peat moss, and store them in the refrigerator or other cold environment until you’re ready to have them root. Note that you can also stick branches in the ground without waiting for roots, but giving them a chance to root first betters their chances."

      "title": "Prepare a spot of moist soil in early April.",
      "content": "Prepare a spot of moist soil in early April. To give your branches the best chance of thriving, wait until early spring, when the weather has warmed a bit. Ideally, choose a spot near a body of water, since pussy willows do best in well-saturated, moist soil. Otherwise, simply pick a spot with plenty of sun, and which you’ll be able to water often. [8] X Trustworthy Source Penn State Extension Educational organization dedicated to delivering science-based information to people, businesses, and communities Go to source In addition, test the soil’s pH , and use a soil pH kit to alter the pH to about 7-8. Pussy willows are pretty easy to please, but will do best in neutral-alkaline soils. [9] X Research source"

      "content": "Plant the branches 6–8 in (15–20 cm) deep in the soil, 6 ft (1.8 m) apart. If you plant too deep, your young tree may become overstressed. Too shallow, and it may develop deformed roots. Several feet of space between planted branches will give them plenty of room to mature without crowding. Once in the soil, tamp down the earth around the base, water generously, and add about 0.5–1 in (1.3–2.5 cm) of mulch. Optionally, add a shrub fertilizer spike to the soil next to the planted branch to feed and kickstart the young shrub."

      "title": "Water the willow generously once a week.",
      "content": "Water the willow generously once a week. Since pussy willows prefer damp soil, such as that found on the sides of creeks, go ahead and give your new shrub plenty of water every week or so during early spring through early fall. Saturate the soil until it's thoroughly wet and just pooling, but not flooded. [10] X Research source"

      "content": "Prune ⅓ of the willow tree annually. Your pussy willow will need to be pruned to keep its growth in check. After about the second year of growth, after your willow has matured and flowered, cut away about ⅓ of the branches at its base (and use these as decoration or further propagation). Then, cut the entire tree down to only a few inches every 3-5 years. In addition, cut away any gray or withered branches as they appear."
