      "content": "Trim the membrane from the underside of the ribs. The membrane is a paper-thin layer on the bone side of the ribs. Many times, your ribs will already be skinned of their membrane. If not, insert a butter knife between the bone and the membrane to create separation. It should come away easily, but use a sharper knife if it doesn't. Then, use your hands to pull the membrane off of the bones. [3] X Research source Leaving membrane on the ribs will result in a tough, rubbery texture."
