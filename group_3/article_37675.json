The trick is that once a player calls a word, it can’t be used by other players. The winner is the player who reaches the end of the alphabet first! [1] X Research source"

      "content": "How to play: Pick one player to start. They must sing (or speak) a line or two of lyrics from a song, and then everyone else has to try and guess the song’s exact title. For example, if you said, “Paint my nails cherry red, match the roses that you left. No remorse, no regret, I forgive every word you said,” the player who guessed “Flowers” by Miley Cyrus would be right! Each correct answer earns a point, and the player with the most points wins. Want to make the game harder? Try talking in a monotone rather than singing."

Then, they must briefly explain the movie’s plot—but do it as vaguely and poorly as possible. Everyone else must guess what the movie is, and the player who guesses correctly gets a point. However, if nobody guesses right, the player explaining the plot gets a point. For example, “Man fights his cousin, saves his home” could be a vague description of Black Panther!"

The storyteller must whisper a short, made-up story to someone else—and then that player must do the same thing, reciting it as best they can to a different player. Keep doing this until everyone in the car has heard the story; the last person to hear it must say it out loud. [2] X Research source Odds are the story will change a lot over the course of Telephone , so enjoy the wacky end result!"

Then, another player must say something negative beginning with “Unfortunately….” Keep going from player to player, taking turns with “Fortunately” and “Unfortunately” statements. You can play this as long as you like! For example: “Fortunately, this highway has plenty of rest stops.” “Unfortunately, rest stop bathrooms are gross.”"

Work with everyone else as they sleep to make up a story about something the sleeping person missed. Then, when they wake up, give a dramatic retelling of the story—with everyone offering lots of specific details to make the whole thing seem believable! For example, you might invent a story about getting lost and running across the creepiest rest stop ever or picking up a stranded celebrity and driving them to a mechanic."

Then, when you see cows on the other side of the road, call out, “Cows on your side!” If you do it before the person on that side of the road can, you steal their point. There’s also a special rule for cemeteries. When you see one, yell, “Ghost cow!” to steal all the points from the other side."

Get one snack item at each station, and try to find all the different colors by the end of the trip! Bonus Game: Regional Food Master. While playing Eat the Rainbow, you could also compete to see who can find the most regional snacks (basically, food items made within the same region as the rest stop). Whoever gets the most wins!"

Everyone can say, “That didn’t happen,” “That happened,” or “Tell me more.” A player who correctly guesses that something did or didn’t happen gets 2 points—but if they’re wrong, you steal 1 of their points and get 2 extra.

Then, let each player pick which of the two scenarios they’d rather deal with! It’s a fun way to explore one another’s personal preferences on a road trip. For example: [3] X Research source Would you rather be in a zombie apocalypse or a robot apocalypse? Would you rather always have a full phone battery or a full gas tank? Would you rather run into an alien or Big Foot? Would you rather be royalty 1,000 years ago or an average person today?"

Then, let everyone else ask two questions to get more information about your story. After that, they must guess whether it’s a lie or the truth. Anyone who guesses correctly gets a point! Have everyone take turns as the one making a claim (so each player gets a chance to guess as well)."

Keep playing until everyone has a chance to be the deceiver. Example statements could include: I’m a vegetarian. My mom and I have the same middle name. I was in a commercial when I was little. I’ve eaten a bug before."

There’s no winner here; it’s just a fun way to see how well you know each other! For example: Who’s most likely to actually be a spy? Who’s most likely to take a week to respond to a text? Who’s most likely to forget about dinner plans? Who’s most likely to survive in a horror movie?"

Players must act as “experts” of their assigned city and do a little research (using their smartphone if needed) on information they could use as trivia questions—like population, landmarks, dining options, or anything else the city might be known for. Then, when you’re passing through a player’s city, they have to ask everyone else trivia questions! For example, you might ask questions like, “How many people live in Bakersfield, California?” (about 413,000) or “What department store originated in Rogers, Arkansas?” (Walmart)."

Then, have everyone fill in their bingo card squares with different things they might see on a road trip—like fast food restaurants, types of cars, and gas station chains. Each time players see something on their bingo card, they can cross off that square. Just make sure there are enough pens or markers for everyone.

Then, another person (also at random) must call the number 2, and so on. Keep calling out numbers in order—but if two players speak simultaneously, everyone has to start over. Players can’t leave more than a 5-second pause between numbers. Typically, the goal is to reach the number 20—but you can make the goal as high as you want!"

One common way is to look for a license plate from every state in the U.S. (or license plates from different countries if you’re in Europe, for example). Another version of the game involves picking a letter of the alphabet and seeing how many license plates you can spot with that letter! [6] X Research source Want to add another layer to the game? See if players can use the letters on a license plate to make an acronym (and turn that acronym into a sentence). For example, the license plate “12C JOB” could be “Twelve Big Cats Jump on the Bed” (or something similar)."
