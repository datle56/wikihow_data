      "content": "Pearº is a silicone ring that shows you’re single and ready to mingle. pearº is a social experiment that aims to take dating off of apps like Tinder, Hinge, Bumble, and Grindr. Wearing the turquoise (or lilac) ring symbolizes that you’re available on the dating market, encouraging others to hit you up IRL. [1] X Research source To join, pay a one-time fee in exchange for 3 silicone rings (1 small, 1 medium, and 1 large), a unique membership number, and access to exclusive MeetUp events for £30. [2] X Research source The turquoise ring is primarily for people who identify as straight, while the lilac ring is for those who identify as LGBTQ+. [3] X Research source The rings don’t have any technology inside that track users. Instead, the results of the “experiment” are their customer success stories. [4] X Research source You can wear your pearº ring on whatever finger you want. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "A one-time pearº ring fee may replace online dating subscriptions. If all 1.2 billion single people around the world wore a pearº ring to show that they’re single, you wouldn’t have to spend money each month on dating app subscriptions—not to mention countless hours scrolling and swiping. Instead, you can just spend the one-time fee to meet people IRL. Pearº also gives you access to singles nights and IRL dating events that wouldn’t be available otherwise through MeetUp groups."

One survey found that 53% of single men said that the fear of seeming creepy reduces their likelihood of talking to women.

      "content": "However, they may make it harder to reject unwanted advances. If you’re wearing a pearº ring and someone you’re not interested in who knows about the social experiment approaches you, it’s harder to say something that lets them down easily, like “I’m sorry, I have a partner.” This potentially might make the ring a safety risk, especially for women. [7] X Research source It also may give some people a “green light” to harass other singles. [8] X Research source If you’re uncomfortable being pursued in a certain environment, like at work, try slipping the ring in your pocket until you’re in the mood to mingle."

      "content": "Pearº rings also don’t eliminate the fear of rejection. Hitting people up (both in person and on an app) takes guts. A fear of rejection may be one of the reasons some people dislike or avoid dating apps. [9] X Research source However, this fear doesn’t go away when dating in person. [10] X Research source Some pearº users may be afraid of putting themselves out there, even with a green (or purple) flag on their finger. Because the rings are to draw in people interested in dating, they may also take away some of the fun and excitement out of taking a chance and asking out someone you find attractive. One of the best ways to get over the fear of rejection is to figure out the root of it and work on learning to love and value yourself . [11] X Research source"

      "content": "Pearº’s MeetUp events might be the ring's biggest benefit. Official pearº events are hosted on the club platform MeetUp in large cities in the US and UK, such as Denver or London . Buying the ring can give you proof that you need to submit to access these groups, which host hangouts and singles events. However, although most of these groups have more than 200 members, some of them aren’t super active or have low attendance. Since most of the groups are in large cities, it might not be worth the purchase for those who live in rural areas. Other cities include Phoenix , Las Vegas , Philadelphia , Washington D.C. , Miami , Chicago , and Detroit ."

      "content": "Pearº rings may be more of a publicity stunt than a beneficial product. Because the only physical item you get from your purchase is the silicone ring and the experiment isn’t popular, some users have called it a “scam.” The company is genuine, but the ring may be more of a publicity stunt than a real attempt at defeating dating apps. Dating apps thrive off the idea that people don’t feel comfortable asking someone if they’re single in person anymore. [12] X Research source Pearº rings may just a placebo to push singles to be more confident approaching others. [13] X Research source Although the rings are an interesting idea, they might not be worth it if not all singles wear them and if the MeetUp groups, events, and additional benefits aren’t well-organized."

However, as sales increase and more people start wearing the rings, there may be more stories about the connections that form because of them. [14] X Research source Currently, 3 turquoise pearº ring releases have sold out, and the stock in their 4th release is 96% gone. [15] X Research source The brand sells around 1,000 to 2,000 rings per day. [16] X Research source The number of people that wear pearº rings might also vary depending on where you live. There may be fewer people wearing them in small towns than in cities, for instance. If you’re single and looking for a real-life connection, the best way to find out if it works is to try it out."

Over 50% of women aged 18 to 34 have experienced harassment or received unwanted sexually explicit messages or photos.

LGBTQ+ individuals have used symbols like handkerchiefs and flowers to signify their relationship status for decades.
