If your rhododendron produces seed pods, prune away the flower clusters every year after blooming is finished. This is also a good time to inspect the plant for broken or diseased branches. [1] X Trustworthy Source University of Missouri Extension University of Missouri program dedicated to research-based, practical public education Go to source If your rhododendron doesn’t develop seed pods (the flowers just shrivel up and disappear when blooming is finished) and it doesn’t drop many leaves each year, it may not need annual pruning—just shape it every few years as needed.

      "title": "Do maintenance pruning in late spring.",
      "content": "Do maintenance pruning in late spring. Wait until your rhododendron has finished blooming to do maintenance pruning so you can fully enjoy the flowers. This will typically be in spring, but the exact timing could vary depending on where you live. Avoid maintenance pruning in the summer after around July. This is when your rhododendron starts to set its buds for next year, so if you prune after this point, you won’t have blooms the next year."

      "title": "Start by removing the spent blooms.",
      "content": "Start by removing the spent blooms. Use pruning shears to snip off the spent bloom clusters. Look for new green growth on the stem just under the spent blooms—make your cut about 1 ⁄ 2 in (1.3 cm) above that, being careful not to damage the new growth. [4] X Research source This process is called “deadheading.” It prevents the flowers from turning into seed pods, so the plant can put more energy into new growth and next year’s flowers. If you want, you can use your fingers to pinch off the spent blooms, but it will be harder to avoid damaging the new growth."

      "title": "Cut back dead or damaged branches.",
      "content": "Cut back dead or damaged branches. Every year after deadheading, examine your rhododendron, looking for branches that are dead, broken, or turning a different color than the rest of the plant (which can indicate disease). Use pruners or loppers to cut back damaged branches. [5] X Research source Either cut off just the damaged portion, making your cut just above a leaf whorl, or cut the entire branch back to the base so your cut is flush with the main stem. If you’d like your rhododendron to be bushier, you can also pinch back new growth at this time. Look for areas where one single shoot of new green growth is emerging from the end of a branch. Use your fingers to pinch off this shoot—more than one shoot should replace it in just a few weeks. [6] X Research source"

Shape your rhododendron when it starts getting a little overgrown, losing its shape, or getting so tall that the inner branches can’t get light. You’ll usually only need to do this every few years. [7] X Trustworthy Source University of Missouri Extension University of Missouri program dedicated to research-based, practical public education Go to source If you have a fast-growing rhododendron or you prefer it to have a more compact shape, you might shape it every 2–3 years. If your rhododendron is slow-growing or you prefer a more natural shape, you might lightly shape it every 3–4 years at the most. If your shrub is near a walkway, you might only need to prune it when the branches start growing into your walking path."

      "title": "Shape rhododendrons in late winter or early summer.",
      "content": "Shape rhododendrons in late winter or early summer. You have two options for when to do a shaping prune on your rhododendron: In the mid to late winter when the plant is dormant (as long as you don’t prune during a freeze), or in the early summer, before July. There are pros and cons to each: Mid- to late winter: If you shape your rhododendron in winter, you may have less of a chance of damage due to pests or disease. New plant buds will start to form as the plant comes out of dormancy, which can create a denser, bushier shrub. However, your rhododendron probably won’t bloom in the following spring because you’ll be removing the set flower buds. [8] X Research source Early summer: If you prune in early summer after your rhododendron blooms, the foliage will be at its fullest. This may make it easier to see where to make natural-looking cuts, and you’ll probably still get flowers the next year. [9] X Research source However, any new growth may not have time to fully harden before winter, so your plant may not be as full for the next year."

Also cut back tall, straight branches that might be blocking sunlight and air from reaching the center of the plant. And any time you’re pruning your rhododendron, check for any damaged or diseased branches. [10] X Research source When you’re pruning a shrub, look for branches that are crossing or tangled—these will compete for space, and you’ll make the shrub stronger by removing one or both. Use pruning shears if a branch is less than 3 ⁄ 4 in (1.9 cm) in diameter. If it’s bigger than that, use loppers ."

If you want to leave part of your branch—like if it’s only a little taller than the branches near it—look for a whorl (or cluster) of leaves near the height you want the branch to be. Make your cut just above the leaves so you won’t have a stubby, bare branch sticking out of your shrub. [11] X Research source Leaving part of a branch is known as a “heading cut.” You’ll often see two branches emerging from this cut once new growth starts to appear, so these cuts are sometimes used to encourage a bushier plant.

      "content": "Cut the branch off flush if you’re removing the whole thing. If you prefer to remove the whole branch, cut it all the way back to where it emerges from its parent stem. This can be a good option if a branch is broken or diseased, or if it’s grown leggy (meaning leaves only appear at the very end of the branch). Cutting the branch all the way back is known as a “thinning cut.” These are more common than heading cuts—they help improve airflow and sunlight to the remaining branches, making the overall plant stronger."

Don’t cut the branches all the same length, and try to maintain the overall shape as you trim.

The safest way to drastically cut back your plant is to cut back about 1/3 of the branches once a year for 3 years. After the third year, you will have pruned the entire plant. [20] X Research source The only way to know whether your rhododendron can survive a more drastic pruning is to cut it back and see if it recovers. But since there’s a pretty strong risk that your rhododendron won’t come back, only do that if you don’t mind losing it. [21] X Research source You could also cut one of the main stems back and watch to see whether it recovers the following year. If it does, you could cut the remaining two stems back to the ground."

Most rhododendrons have three main branches coming out of the base, or crown, of the plant, with smaller branches growing from these. If your plant needs a radical rejuvenation, choose one of these primary branches and cut it back so it’s about 1–2 ft (0.30–0.61 m) long. [22] X Research source Since you’ll be cutting the rhododendron’s thick, primary branches, use a pair of loppers to make the cuts. When you’re choosing where to make the cut, examine the branch. Look for a cluster of tiny pink dots—these are latent buds, and they’ll form new shoots in the following years. [23] X Research source"

      "content": "Fertilize your rhododendron about a month before you prune. A little planning ahead can give your rhododendron extra nutrition to recover from pruning. Applying a fertilizer for azaleas and rhododendrons to the soil about a month before you plant to prune will help the shrub develop more dormant buds—and therefore more new growth. [25] X Research source Carefully follow the label instructions on the fertilizer—rhododendrons and azaleas don’t need much fertilizer, and they can be damaged if you use too much."

The easiest way to sanitize them is to wipe them down with 70% rubbing alcohol.

Dull tools can tear the bark, leaving your rhododendron susceptible to insects or disease. [27] X Research source Use pruning shears if you’re cutting branches that are 3 ⁄ 4 in (1.9 cm) or less in diameter. For branches that are up to 1 1 ⁄ 2 in (3.8 cm) in diameter, use lopping shears .

This will cause less damage to your plant, and will lessen the chances of it going into shock or dying. You can make your cuts on any part of the branch—new growth will emerge from tiny latent buds under the bark.
