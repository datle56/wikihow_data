If you have this file, then this method will work for you. Keep note of where this file is OR copy and paste it where you can locate it easily. A good place would be your desktop. If you don’t have the Main.DB file because it has been deleted after formatting your hard drive for example, then this method won’t work unfortunately. Check every computer that you’ve used to log into Skype if you don’t have it on your computer. Find it and email it to yourself, so that you can access the file on your computer."
