[1] X Trustworthy Source Microsoft Support Technical support and product information from Microsoft. Go to source The dollar signs in the formula are absolute references to make sure the formula will always look to those specific cells, even if it is copied elsewhere into the worksheet. The loan interest rate must be divided by 12, since it is an annual rate that is calculated monthly. For example, if your loan is for $150,000 at 6 percent interest for 30 years (360 months), your loan payment will calculate out to $899.33."

To do this: Click the first date cell, hover your mouse cursor over the cell's bottom-right corner to bring up the crosshair, then drag down the column. At first, the dates will be wrong—don't worry.
