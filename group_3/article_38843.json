Then, put a single-color load into the washing machine drum, spreading them out evenly. For best results, limit the number of items to a small load (about 1 to 4 items). While you may choose to mix colors in the washing machine after the initial wash, you will want to separate them out for the first wash in order to accurately set the color in with vinegar."

      "content": "Choose distilled white vinegar to avoid discoloration. Distilled white vinegar is generally the best option for effectively setting color in clothes without any risk of damaging the fabric. While some popular vinegars, such as red wine vinegar and apple cider vinegar, have a natural color that may effect some clothing fabrics, distilled white vinegar is safe to use on your clothing. [1] X Research source Distilled white vinegar can be found at most grocery stores, or you can order it online."

      "content": "Pour the distilled white vinegar onto your new clothes. First, put your new clothes in the washing machine. Then, pour ½ to 1 cup (240 mL) of white vinegar on top of the clothes, depending on how large your load is. The vinegar smell might be strong but don't worry – it should dissipate in the wash. [2] X Research source For best results, only add the clothes you want to set color in, limiting to a few items. You do not need to add laundry detergent when washing with white vinegar, as the vinegar will disinfect your clothing."

While you can run your clothes through the dryer if you prefer (or if you need them done quickly), heat causes the fabrics to break down faster, causing your clothes to fade. After the vinegar has helped set the color, air drying helps keep colors bright and fabrics strong. [4] X Research source While the vinegar smell should evaporate during the rinse cycle, if there is any residual smell, air drying should get rid of it. [5] X Research source In addition to setting the colors, vinegar cleans and sanitizes your clothes, so you won't need to run them through again with your regular detergent until they are in need of another wash. Distilled vinegar also can even work as a natural fabric softener. [6] X Expert Source Kamel Almani Laundry & Cleaning Specialist Expert Interview. 13 April 2021."

[7] X Research source Adding table salt to the first cycle for new clothes can help set the colors and keep them from running during future washes. If you are only trying to set the colors in one piece of clothing, for example, use only 1 tablespoon (15 mL). Increase by 1 tablespoon (15 mL) per additional piece of clothing. Adding salt to your wash cycle during future washes may also help faded colors become vibrant again. [8] X Research source"

To avoid over-washing, spot clean synthetic fabrics whenever possible. [12] X Research source"
