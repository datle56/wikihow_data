      "title": "Use a hammer.",
      "content": "Use a hammer. One of the simplest methods of cracking pecan shells is just to use a hammer and a hard surface. Place the nut on a hard, solid surface and hit it with the hammer. You may need to rotate the nut to hit it in a second spot. Mind your fingers! Although this method is quick, it tends to break the nut meat, leaving you with fragmented pieces of pecan. If you're looking for whole pecan halves, you'd be better off using another method."

      "title": "Remove the nut meat from the shell.",
      "content": "Remove the nut meat from the shell. Once you have cracked the shell using your chosen method, you will need to carefully remove the nut meat from the broken shell, keeping the pecan halves as intact as possible. Use your fingers or a small pair of pliers to peel the shell away from one half of the nut. Then use a nut pick to pry the two pecan halves out of the remaining shell. Pecans are ideally removed from their shells in halves , but it's not a big deal if they break -- any nut meat you can salvage from the broken shell is usable."

Even a small amount of this material left in the nut can leave a bitter taste in the mouth of the person who consumes it."
