      "content": "Remove rust from a flat section of any type of bathtub. The lemon juice contains a natural acid that will dissolve rust without damaging the surface of your tub. But the juice is thin and will flow away when you apply it, so use it on a flat part of the bathtub that has rust on it, such as the bottom or near the drain. [1] X Research source You can use sea salt or iodized table salt, but it needs to be fine in order to effectively soak up the lemon juice and form a paste. If your bathtub has a shelf with rust on it, you can use lemon juice and salt to remove it from there. If you don’t have lemons or lemon juice, you can use lime or lime juice!"

Fully saturate the affected areas and make sure the rust is covered with the juice. Allow the lemon juice to soak into the rust for at least 10 minutes. [2] X Research source Use as many lemons or lemon juice as it takes to cover the affected areas. Set a timer for 10 minutes so you can be sure the juice has had a chance to soak in."
