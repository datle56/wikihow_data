For the Wii and Wii U, you will have to use the Wii Remote. For the Xbox 360/Xbox One (original), youâ€™ll use the Kinect. For PlayStation 3, 4, or 5 (prior to JD2022), you can either use the PS Move controller or the PS Camera. Plus, the original Controller app is effective for playing on Just Dance 2017 - 2022."

You can also customize your profile if you're playing Just Dance 2019 and above, and you can change your avatar, alias, and the background of the profile. Your profile can also be seen publicly if you get \"Dancer of the Week\" (for getting the best score for a song; only on 2019-2022)/on the top 100 on a leaderboard (2023) or if you participate in the World Dance Floor (2018-2022)."

You can choose any of them, but the only difference is the moves performed. You may need to focus on the difficulty of the song that best suits your needs if you're playing Just Dance 1 to 3 to Just Dance 2019 - 2025 since these games contain difficulty levels. If you are warming up, try going for the Easy routines. Those looking for a challenge should go for the Hard routines."
