      "title": "Determine how rare your card is.",
      "content": "Determine how rare your card is. The most important part of making a profit from selling your highest value collectibles is knowing exactly how much they’re worth, which begins with identifying rarity. There are 7 main tiers when it comes to rarity in the Yu-Gi-Oh! universe: common, rare, super rare, ultra rare, secret rare, ultimate rare, and ghost rare. Common cards and rare cards are pretty similar. The main difference is that common cards are not holographic and printed on cardboard, whereas rare cards have their names printed in silver or gold. Both are relatively attainable when purchasing a pack. The following are harder to come by: Super rare cards are printed with a holographic gloss, which make them “foils,\" while ultra rare cards have gold or silver embossing, as well as an overall holographic effect. [13] X Research source Secret rare cards feature a diagonal shine effect on the card as well as a holographic name, while ultimate rare cards showcase a gold name along with all gold card attributes and embossed elements. Ghost rare cards are the rarest of the bunch and truly stand out as the whole card is silver and holographic. There are other fringe categories of rarity, like Gold Rare, Platinum Rare, and Starfoil Rare. Prices can vary widely so it’s important that you verify the rarity of yours."

      "title": "Make note of the condition of your card.",
      "content": "Make note of the condition of your card. The condition of your collector’s card is just as important as its rarity. There are a few agreed-upon categories to measure condition, including mint, near mint, excellent, good, played, and poor. Mint condition implies they’re still in their original packaging, while near mint is best reserved for cards who have been pulled out of the pack but are still perfectly preserved. Excellent describes cards with only minor flaws, while good points to more visible flaws. [14] X Research source Played cards have a bit of wear and tear, with frayed or ripped edges. Cards in poor condition are highly damaged and have little re-sale profit potential."

      "title": "Learn what edition your card is.",
      "content": "Learn what edition your card is. Since Yu-Gi-Oh! cards have been released in a variety of ways– from grand prizes at tournaments to video game expansion packs– a collector with a 1st edition card is most likely to receive a nice chunk of change for it. 1st edition cards are more rare than limited edition and unlimited edition cards, therefore resulting in higher market value. [15] X Research source Websites like Card Marvin and Yu-Gi-Oh Prices can easily help you figure out how much your collectible is worth simply by punching in your card's information."

      "title": "Decide which cards you want to sell or choose to sell them in bulk.",
      "content": "Decide which cards you want to sell or choose to sell them in bulk. After you've assessed the rarity, condition, and edition of your collectibles, deciding which ones you want to put up for sale is the next step. You can figure this out by looking up the same cards or cards of a similar caliber online and see how much they're going for. Websites like Toad and Troll offer a list of best-sellers to give you a comprehensive idea of the current market. The top best-selling cards include Sosei Ryu-Ge Mistva (Ultra Rare 1st Edition), Ice Ryzeal (Ultra Rare 1st Edition), and Triple Tactics Thrust (Super Rare 1st Edition). As a general guideline, the rarer cards in the most pristine conditions are most likely to sell for the highest prices. Selling common in bulk is advised for 2 main reasons: you won't make any real money selling common single cards, and you can help people who are primarily interested in building up their decks."

      "title": "Scan your cards so you can upload them online.",
      "content": "Scan your cards so you can upload them online. Investing in a digital card scanner with high image resolution capability might be your next move. Using a scanner creates a digital copy of your physical cards, making them easier to organize, access, and sell, but it’s important to pick the right one so as to not damage your Yu-Gi-Oh! cards. [16] X Research source Digital scanners, like the ScanSnap SV600 and the fi-8170 , can come with a lofty price tag, but they also capture the true image of the card, including color, embossed elements, and condition. Some smartphone apps, like TCGplayer and Dragon Shield, are free to use and offer a good portable option for selling cards at tournaments, but they don't capture as much detail as digital scanners."

      "content": "Sell your cards on eBay and other online stores. There are tons of avenues to explore when it comes to selling your rare Yu-Gi-Oh! cards. Many online seller and auction sites are reputable, to varying degrees. Here are some of the best online options to sell your one-in-a-million collectibles: [17] X Research source eBay: One of the largest and most successful online markets for selling and buying collectibles, eBay charges a seller’s fee that typically accounts for 5-10% of the final price. Heart of the Cards: This online store focuses on bringing the Japanese world of collectibles to Western audiences, offering about 40% of your card’s market value even if it falls under the “played” condition. Card Market: Another online platform exclusively designed to buy and sell cards, this one offers a user friendly interface and payments are easily made through PayPal. Troll and Toad: This online store is a great option for all things playing cards, but does require you to sell a minimum of $30 and pays via check, PayPal, or store credit."
