[1] X Expert Source Homer Flores Appliance Repair Specialist Expert Interview. 14 April 2021. To do this, head to your home's main circuit breaker, find the switch corresponding to the oven, and flip it to the “Off” position. You may find 2 individual breakers, 1 for each of the 120-volt fuses that powers the oven. If so, shut off both breakers by flipping the corresponding switches. Then, pull out the cooking racks in the oven and set them aside. If there's no separate breaker for the oven, you may have to flip the breaker for the whole kitchen. As an added safety precaution, unplug the oven from the wall to guarantee no electricity is connected to the oven. The oven remains unplugged until you're ready to test the replacement element in a later step. Removing the cooking racks should provide you with enough space to access and replace the heating element, making it unnecessary to remove the oven door."

      "title": "Remove the base panel covering the heating element.",
      "content": "Remove the base panel covering the heating element. Start by pulling out the cooking racks from the oven. Some ovens have flat metal covers at the bottom to keep the lower baking elements out of sight. To remove 1 of these covers, feel for the grooved lip on the front edge and pull up on it sharply. Then, lift the panel away from its slot. [2] X Research source If you don't see the curving wire element when you open the oven door, there's a good chance a cover is concealing it. Your base panel may also be secured by 1-2 screws. If this is the case, unscrew them with a flathead screwdriver and set them aside before proceeding. Not all base panels have raised lips. If this is the case, push down on one corner of the panel to lift the opposite corner enough to grip."

      "content": "Unscrew the element at the front and back with a flathead screwdriver. [3] X Research source Loosen and extract the screws at each connection site with a flathead screwdriver. Most heating elements, also called baking coils, have 2 screws on the front side and 2 more along the back, connecting the piece to the rear wall of the oven. If the element in your oven is fastened with bolts instead of standard screws, strip them using a 1 ⁄ 4 inch (0.64 cm) nut driver tool. Set the screws aside, like in a small bowl, to avoid losing them. You'll need them again after installing the new baking element ."

      "content": "Detach the wires running to the element with needle-nosed pliers. Pull the loose baking coil a few inches from the rear wall to create a comfortable amount of space. Then, use a pair of needle-nosed pliers or your fingers to gently pull or slide the colored wires away from the terminals on the element's backside. [4] X Research source Note how the wires are configured (it may be helpful to take a picture) so you'll be able to easily reconnect them once you've installed the new element. Be careful not to let the wires slip through the holes in the back of the oven, or you'll have no choice but to pull the entire unit out to thread them back through. [5] X Expert Source Homer Flores Appliance Repair Specialist Expert Interview. 14 April 2021. It may help to tape them to the interior wall. Heating element wires are sometimes secured with small male-female spade connectors or a thin, interlocking metal slot and insert. These can usually be separated with a quick pinch of your pliers."

      "content": "Identify the make and model of the old element and purchase a new one. You should be able to make out a brand name, model number, or serial code indicating the part's manufacturer on one of the element's broad metal faces. Alternatively, refer to your oven’s user manual if you still have it to determine the exact heating element you need to ensure you purchase its perfect match. [6] X Research source Jot down any identifying info on the element before disposing of it to take to the hardware store if you plan on buying your replacement part in person. If you're unable to find the exact model you need in stores, try ordering a replacement online ."

      "content": "Fit the new element into the oven by lining up the screw holes. Position the element over the bottom surface of the oven, with the metal screw plates facing down and the terminals facing the rear of the oven. [7] X Research source Then, double-check that the screw holes on the element line up with those on the oven. Convection baking coils are typically installed on the top of the oven rather than the bottom, like electric ovens, but the installation process is the same."

      "content": "Reconnect the terminal wires using pliers. Grab your pliers again and guide the ends of the replacement part's wires into the terminals on the element's backside. Once the wires are secure, slide the element back until it rests flush against the rear wall of the oven. [8] X Research source If there are male-female connectors on the ends of the wires, you should hear them click when they're firmly in place. Ensure each wire runs to its correct terminal (they should end just in front of their corresponding connection sites) to prevent a possible fire hazard. Keep a loose grip on the pliers to avoid damaging the delicate ends of the wires."

      "content": "Screw down the element with a screw or nut driver. [9] X Research source Insert the screws into the metal plates on the bottom of the element, 2 in the front and 2 in the back. Tighten them with your screwdriver or nut driver tool to the right until they stop turning. Then, Give the element a gentle shake to feel for loose connections. Use a 1 ⁄ 4 inch (0.64 cm) nut driver tool if your element fastens with bolts instead of screws."

      "content": "Slip the base panel back in over the heating element. If your oven features a separate cover, slip it back over the newly-installed element and press down until it lies flat. Secure any other screws or fasteners before restoring power to the oven. [10] X Research source Gaps or raised corners could indicate that the base panel has been installed slightly crooked."

      "title": "Restore power to the oven and put the racks back in.",
      "content": "Restore power to the oven and put the racks back in. Head back to the circuit breaker and flip the switch for the oven to the “On” position. Remember to hit both breakers if your oven operates on dual fuses. This will direct electricity back to the oven, so it's important to ensure that you've finished making all necessary adjustments by this point. Then, slide the racks back into the oven. [11] X Research source Don't forget to plug the oven back in if you unplugged it earlier."

      "content": "Test the new baking coil by setting it to \"bake.\" Turn on the oven and set it to “bake” or “convection,” depending on which element you've replaced, and give it a few minutes to warm up. [12] X Research source Then, hold one hand up a safe distance from the heating element, careful not to touch it. It shouldn't take long for it to begin radiating heat. An active heating element will typically glow red when it's nice and hot. Try gradually upping the heat setting to see how well the new element handles higher temperatures. The wiring may be wrong if your oven still feels cool after replacing a suspect heating element. Call a qualified electrician and have them diagnose and repair the problem."

      "content": "Watch for smoking. Don't be alarmed if you see a few wisps of smoke escaping from the oven as it heats up—this is just the protective factory coating burning off the outside of the new element and isn’t anything to worry about. [13] X Research source That said, it's recommended to hold off on cooking anything until 30 minutes after installing the new element. You may also notice a faint acrid odor. Heavy or continuous smoke may indicate that one of the oven's components has caught fire. If the smoking doesn't stop after a few minutes, contact your local fire department."
