      "content": "Locate a pair of chopsticks. The wooden kind from a restaurant will work, but not for any good length of time because they can snap easily, causing splinters to get caught in your hair and possibly even hurt you. There are smooth bamboo ones that you can buy that are much higher quality. You can also buy plastic ones, which tend to be the best and are inexpensive. Whatever you decide to use, be sure the sticks are clean and new! Metallic chopsticks are another option, although these are a little more difficult to find. Check out the hair care aisles of your local drug and grocery stores - you'll be able to find a variety of different styles that you can experiment with."

If you have curly hair, use a pick to gently detangle any major knots and smooth it down before proceeding. Make sure to remove any hair accessories or bobby pins before starting the process. Many women find that chopsticks hairstyles are difficult to achieve on freshly washed hair because clean hair can be very slippery. Whether this will affect you depends on the texture of your hair, but you may want to try this style on hair that hasn't been washed for a day or two. [1] X Research source"

The amount of times you wind the hair will depend on how long your hair is. A chignon is an ideal hairstyle for adding chopsticks in. In this case, make the chignon first, then push in the chopsticks for effect.

Many women think that chopstick hairstyles work best on hair that hasn't been washed in at least 2 days, but it really just depends on your hair. If your freshly washed hair isn't slippery, you should have no issues.

Holding your low ponytail in your left hand, use your right hand to slide one of the chopsticks (pointy end up) diagonally under the ponytail. Twist the chopstick itself around clockwise, making sure that when you stop, the pointy end is pointing up, just like at the beginning. [4] X Research source Twist the chopstick clockwise as many times as your hair will allow. Some people will only be able to do it once, others will be able to twist it several times around. Once you start feeling your hair pull a little at your scalp, stop twisting. Hold on to the ends of your hair as tightly as you can throughout the remainder of the process, since the twist won't be fully secure until the final step."
