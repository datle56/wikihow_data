Let each player pick the hippo they’d like to play as—in the newest version of the game, there are yellow, orange, green, and blue game pieces to choose from. [1] X Research source Believe it or not, the hungry hippos all have names! According to Hasbro, the green hippo is named Veggie Potamus, the yellow one is named Bottomless Potamus, the blue one is named Sweetie Potamus, and the orange one is named Hungry Hippo. Vintage versions of the game might have a purple or pink hippo instead of the blue one. In this version of the game, the purple hippo is named Lizzie, the pink hippo is Happy, the orange one is Henry, the green one is Homer, and the yellow one is Harry. [2] X Research source"

Do your best to “eat” the marble before any other hippos do, continuing to press the lever until the marble gets “eaten.” [3] X Research source You can press the lever repeatedly, or wait for the marble to roll toward your hippo—try out different strategies and see what works for you!"
