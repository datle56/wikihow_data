      "title": "Find a private place to smoke it.",
      "content": "Find a private place to smoke it. If at all possible, make it an outdoor spot. Part of the garage, or an area under your deck are both good choices. If an outdoor spot isn’t an option, you can use the bathroom. A bedroom isn’t a great spot to smoke if you’re trying to hide it. There are a lot of fabrics that will soak in the smoke and it will be hard to mask the smell."

      "content": "Timing your smoke breaks. If you’re disappearing to smoke every hour, your parents will get suspicious. Time your breaks wisely. Use other excuses to get a moment away. Before you shower. Using the bathroom after a meal. Nightly phone call from your boyfriend/girlfriend."

      "content": "Use a fan. Having ventilation planned is key to hiding the smell of smoke. Placing a portable fan at a window can help control air flow and diffuse the hazy, smelly cloud of smoke. Use a room that already has a fan. Carrying a fan around with you is suspicious."

      "content": "Freshen your breath. Brush your teeth immediately after smoking. If your smoking spot is outside and you have to cross your parents before getting into the bathroom, use chewing gum to freshen your breath. You can also hide the smell by eating something with a strong odor, like onions or garlic. Of course, if you go this route, you’ll smell like onions or garlic, but that might be better than smelling like smoke. [4] X Research source"
