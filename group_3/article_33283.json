This process is very similar to “heads” or “tails.” There is no advantage to either of them, so you can just pick what you want. There isn’t a “youngest picks first” rule to this game. Just try to agree on who will represent each side! For example, if you decide you are \"evens,\" your opponent has to be \"odds.\""

Be sure to agree on a total number of rounds so you can accurately keep track of how many points each player has. [2] X Research source For instance, if you’d like to play a longer game, have the game be 20 rounds. A shorter game might be 3-5 rounds. It may help to use a piece of scrap paper to keep track of each round."

      "content": "Count to 3 with the other player while keeping your hands hidden. There’s no game timer in Odds and Evens, so you and the other player have to keep the game going. As you count, pick a number of fingers between 1 and 5 to hold out in your hand, which you can display after counting to 3. Make sure your hands are hidden so your opponent can’t see what number you’re holding up. You don’t have to yell out a guess while playing Odds and Evens, but this can add a fun dimension to the game."

If the total number is odd, then the player representing “odds” wins a point for the round. If the number is “even,” then the “evens” player wins. For instance, if you hold out 4 fingers and the other player holds out 3 fingers, the total would be 7. In this case, the winner of the round would be the “odds” player. Don’t be discouraged if you don’t win the round—there’s plenty of time to catch up!"

For instance, if the total sum was 9 and a player guessed 8, then they wouldn’t get the point. Don’t worry about this if you’re playing a simple version of the game that doesn’t involve verbal guessing."
