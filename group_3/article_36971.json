Check if any of the tiles you’re replacing intersect with any of the fixtures in your shower, such as the shower head , faucet , or overflow drain . Unscrew or pull the fixtures off of the wall and set them aside for now so you can reinstall them later on. [1] X Research source You don’t need to remove the fixtures if you’re only replacing single tiles that aren’t in the way of your fixtures. If you don’t feel comfortable taking out the fixtures yourself, then contact a plumber or a contractor to come do the work for you."

      "content": "Cover your workspace and drains with a drop cloth to prevent any damage. Falling tile pieces can scratch or damage your bath or flooring underneath them. Spread a drop cloth over the entire area where you’re working and use painter’s tape to secure it in place so it doesn’t slip or move around. Make sure the tub drain is completely covered if you’re removing shower tiles so none of the pieces get stuck in your pipes. [2] X Research source If you don’t have a drop cloth, you can use old bedsheets instead."

      "content": "Cut through the grout around the tiles with a grout removal tool. [3] X Expert Source Art Fricke Home Renovation & Repair Specialist Expert Interview. 1 July 2020. Grout removal tools have saw-like teeth that easily grind through grout to make it easier to remove. Start the blade in one corner of the tile and pull it straight across the grout to cut into it. Go over the area a few times applying a medium amount of pressure to completely remove the grout. Cut through each line of grout around the tile so you’re able to pry it out of place. [4] X Research source Work through the grout around 1 tile at a time so it’s easier to remove. You don’t have to remove the grout from the tiles at this point if you don’t want to, but it makes the tiles easier to remove and will help keep your workspace cleaner."

      "content": "Pry the tiles off of the wall with a hammer and flat chisel. Start at the outer edge of the top row of tiles to make them the easiest to remove. Hold the end of a flat chisel against the edge of the tile at a 30-degree angle. Tap the other end of the chisel with a hammer to force the chisel under the tile and remove it from the wall. Work completely across each row from top to bottom. [5] X Research source Put on work gloves and safety glasses to protect yourself from any tile shards or sharp edges. Wear long pants while you’re working since the tiles could fall and cut you. The old tiles may break when you chisel them out of place or when they fall down."

After you remove all of the tiles, there may still be some sections of mortar still stuck on your wall. Hold a metal scraper at a 45-degree angle to the adhesive and apply a firm amount of pressure to lift up the adhesive. Continue scraping it to remove as much as you can before moving on. [8] X Research source If you have trouble removing the mortar with a metal scraper, use your flat chisel and a hammer to apply more pressure."

Start at the top of your wall and brush in short strokes down to push any residual material onto your drop cloth. Continue brushing the wall until you don’t see it lift up any more dust. [9] X Research source You can also use the hose attachment on your vacuum to clean your walls, but make sure you don’t suck up large tile pieces since they could cut the hose or damage the inside of your vacuum."

Then check the dimensions of the tiles you’re using to see how they will fit on your wall. Calculate the area of the wall and divide it by the area of a single tile so you know how many tiles you need for your space. Choose to line up your new tiles in a grid pattern or offset them slightly to make the space more visually interesting. [10] X Research source For example, if your bathroom wall is 30 square feet (2.8 m 2 ) and your tiles each cover 1 ⁄ 2 square foot (0.046 m 2 ), then you’ll need 60 tiles total. You don’t need to plan a layout if you’re only replacing a single tile, but make sure the measurements are the same. You may need to cut the tiles to a specific size if they don’t perfectly fit on your wall."

Scoop out a large blob of the tile mortar from the container and spread it on your wall. Only cover a section that’s about 3–4 square feet (0.28–0.37 m 2 ) so it doesn’t dry before you’re able to place your tiles. Drag the edge of a square notch trowel over the mortar to leave grooves in it so the mortar has room to expand when you press a tile onto it.

Push the tile into the space where you want to put it and press it firmly against the wall so it sticks to the mortar. Apply pressure to the entire surface of the tile to get an even mortar application on the back.

Continue applying more mortar as you need to install your new tiles and press them into place so they stick to the wall. Slide 1-2 spacers on every side of the tiles so they stay a uniform distance apart, or else they’ll get crooked. Let the mortar set for 24 hours so it can dry.

Pull the spacers out from your wall so you have a clean work surface. Follow the directions on the package of grout and mix it until it has a thick enough consistency where you can form it into a ball. Pick up some of the grout on the end of a rubber grout float, which is like a squeegee, and work it into the spaces between the tiles. Start at the edges of your tiles and pull the float across the edges diagonally to force the grout inside. [16] X Research source You can buy grout and a grout float from your local hardware store.

Lightly tap the end of the chisel with a hammer or rubber mallet to break the tile off of your floor. If you can’t lift the tile after hitting it from one side, try positioning your chisel on the opposite side and prying it from there. Continue removing the other tiles the same way. [19] X Research source Begin on one of the tiles along the outer edge of your room if you plan on replacing the whole tile floor so you have an easier starting point.

You can choose to lay out your tiles in any pattern you want, but you may need to cut some if they don’t fit in the space. Take multiple pictures of your layouts so you can compare them side by side.

If you need to apply more pressure to the tile, lightly tap it with a rubber mallet until it sets into place.
