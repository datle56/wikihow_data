      "content": "Let the conditioner dry. Sit under a dryer for about 20 minutes to allow your hair to soak up the oil more effectively. Let the braids air dry for another 10 minutes. To let the oil absorb even more, you can leave your hair in the cap for up to an hour after applying the heat. Avoid heating your hair for more than 30 minutes, since your hair will stop absorbing oil after this point."
