      "content": "Try electrolysis for year-long results. Electrolysis is done by a licensed dermatologist, so make an appointment with your doctor. During this procedure, the doctor will insert a thin wire into your hair follicle underneath your skin. Then, they will use an electrical current to destroy the hair root, making the hair fall out and preventing it from growing back. [1] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Typically, results will last for about 1 year. Electrolysis can be slightly uncomfortable. Many people report feeling a pinch or a warm sensation as the electrical current zaps their hair follicle. Usually, you’ll need more than 1 appointment for best results. Your dermatologist will assess your pubic hair and see how many appointments you need and how far apart they should be."

      "content": "Go for laser hair removal to see limited hair growth for months. Make an appointment with a licensed dermatologist for laser hair removal. During your appointment, your doctor will numb your pubic area with numbing gel. Then, they will take a laser and hold it against your skin, using the laser to kill the hair within the follicle. As the laser is working, you may feel a slight snapping sensation, like a rubber band being snapped against your skin. Laser hair removal usually prevents hair from growing back for months or even years, and when it does grow back, it’s typically less thick. [2] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Dermatology Professional organization made of over 20,000 certified dermatologists Go to source If you are using antibiotics or retinoids, stop using them at least 2 weeks before laser hair removal to protect your skin. Depending on how thick your pubic hair is, you may need multiple sessions of laser hair removal. If you have any sort of redness or inflammation after laser hair removal, ask your doctor for a hydrocortisone cream."

      "content": "Get a prescription cream to slow hair growth. A prescription cream won’t remove the hair, but it can slow its growth within 4 to 8 weeks. Make an appointment with a dermatologist and ask them about a prescription cream, like Vaniqa or Eflora. If your doctor thinks you’re a good candidate for the cream, you can apply it every day 2 times per day to slow the growth of your pubic hair. [3] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Dermatology Professional organization made of over 20,000 certified dermatologists Go to source Since the cream doesn’t remove hair, you’ll have to shave or wax your pubic hair before putting it on. The cream works well, but it only works for as long as you use it. If you stop using the cream, your hair will grow back like normal."

      "content": "Try an at-home IPL device for DIY hair removal on your bikini area. If you don’t want to go through the hassle of heading to a dermatologist, you can buy a Low-Energy Intense Pulsed Light (IPL) device to give yourself a hair removal treatment. Simply turn the device on and run it over your bikini area to zap the hair follicles. Most people need to use this device for multiple sessions before seeing long-lasting results. [4] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source IPL is similar to laser therapy, but it releases many wavelengths instead of just one. It penetrates down to the second layer of skin without harming the top layer, which can lead to less irritation. Keep in mind that IPL devices cannot be used on your genitals—they are only safe for use on your bikini area, or the hair that might poke out of a bathing suit. IPL devices are most effective on people with light skin and dark hair, because the laser targets the pigment within the hair follicle. If you have darker skin, there is a higher risk that an IPL device could cause burns."

      "content": "Get waxed by a professional to remove hair for 3 to 6 weeks. While waxing isn’t permanent, it can still remove pubic hair quickly and make it grow back slowly. Go to a professional esthetician, then ask them for a bikini wax (removing the hair you might see outside of a bathing suit) or a Brazilian wax (removing all of the hair in your pubic area). [5] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Dermatology Professional organization made of over 20,000 certified dermatologists Go to source If you are taking isotretinoin, using an antibiotic, or applying tretinoin cream to your skin, talk to your doctor before waxing. These medications can thin your skin, which can cause it to tear when waxed. If you don’t want to see a professional, you can wax yourself at home . Just be sure to buy high-quality wax, and follow the directions carefully."

      "content": "Try a depilatory cream to remove hair for 2 weeks. Depilatory creams are creams, gels, or lotions that you can find at any drug store. Simply apply the cream to your skin, wait the recommended amount of time on the bottle, and rinse your skin. [6] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Depilatory creams dissolve hair at the root, so it takes the hair a few days to come back. If you’ve never used depilatory creams before, do a patch test on your arm before applying it to your pubic area. Depilatory creams are convenient, but many have a strong odor that can be unpleasant."

      "content": "Shave your pubic hair at home for fastest removal. Shaving only lasts 2 to 3 days, but it’s easy to do yourself, and it doesn’t take long. Be sure to use a moisturizing shaving cream , and swap out your razor every 5 to 7 times you use it. Shave in the direction your hair grows to avoid irritation, and follow up with a moisturizer to keep your skin hydrated. Shaving can lead to ingrown hairs or irritation. If you find that your skin is red, bumpy, or itchy after you shave, consider trying a different method."

If you only have a few stray pubic hairs that you’d like to get rid of, grab a pair of tweezers and firmly grab one hair at a time. Pull the hair out in the direction that it grows to avoid irritation as much as possible. [7] X Research source Tweezing can be uncomfortable or even painful, especially in a sensitive area. If tweezing is too uncomfortable for you, try a different method. If you’re prone to ingrown hairs, tweezing might not be for you.

      "content": "Trim your pubic hair to shape it up. If you’re fine with having a little bit of pubic hair but you don’t want it to look unkempt, use scissors to trim it. Use a mirror to see what you’re doing, and gently snip your pubic hair until you’re happy with how it looks. Trimming your hair won’t remove it completely, but it can help tame your pubic hair in a pinch."
