      "title": "Detach the hose from the faucet.",
      "content": "Detach the hose from the faucet. Leaving your hose attached to the faucet for the winter is asking for trouble. Doing this may lead to interior water lines freezing and bursting. Simply disconnect the hose from the faucet to reduce the likelihood of this occurring in your home. [1] X Research source To disconnect the hose, turn it to the left or counter-clockwise. Wriggle the hose forward and back to remove any debris that's clogging the spigot threads. Lightly tap the spigot with a hammer and spray it with WD-40. Wait a few minutes and use pliers to try and release the hose. You can also use a hair dryer or heat gun on the spigot to make the metal expand, which will make it easier to remove the hose."

      "title": "Drain your hoses.",
      "content": "Drain your hoses. Water can lie dormant in hoses and when it freezes, it will expand and can cause damage to the material of your hose. Go to a part of your property with a slope and lay the hose along it. The water will drain out at the end of the hose and run down the slope."

      "title": "Store your hoses for the winter.",
      "content": "Store your hoses for the winter. It is best to stock your hoses in your garage or in your shed for the winter, keeping them safe from damage from the elements. Curl them up and hang them somewhere in your garage. If you want to further protect your hoses, wrap them in insulation tubing. Simply pry open the long slit on the tubing and fit it over the hoses. Tape the slit shut for maximum protection. This will also protect the material from cold weather and possible damage."

      "title": "Find the location of the valve in your home.",
      "content": "Find the location of the valve in your home. This method should only be used to turn off the faucet before winter and should not be followed during the winter. Every house tends to have the interior valve located in a different place. Typically, you can find the interior valve in 1 of 3 places, depending on the design of your home: [2] X Research source [3] X Expert Source Dave Jones Master Plumber, Roto-Rooter Plumbing & Water Cleanup Expert Interview. 29 March 2021. Basement: The valve is normally situated near the front foundation wall. It should be within 3–5 feet (0.91–1.52 m) of the location where the main water enters the basement. Crawl space with a basement: You can find the shut-off valve where the main water enters the basement in a crawl space in older homes. Crawl space with no basement: You should be able to find the valve near the water heater or beneath the kitchen sink."

      "title": "Identify the correct valve to close.",
      "content": "Identify the correct valve to close. If your home has a fire sprinkler system, you will need to exercise extra care when choosing the correct valve to shut-off. If your home does not have a fire sprinkler system, things are a little more straightforward. [4] X Research source [5] X Expert Source Dave Jones Master Plumber, Roto-Rooter Plumbing & Water Cleanup Expert Interview. 29 March 2021. For homes with fire sprinklers and an inside main water meter, find the 2nd valve. It should be above the main water meter and “downstream” of the fire sprinkler tee. For homes with fire sprinklers and an outside main water meter, find the 2nd valve, which will also be “downstream” of the fire sprinkler tee. Homes with an outside water meter and no fire sprinklers will usually have one valve that has the capability of shutting off the water for the entire home."

      "content": "Close the valve. Some valves have round wheel handles which you can close by turning them clockwise or to the right. Other valves have level handles which you can close by using ¼ turns until the handle is no longer parallel to the pipe.

Try and open faucets around the home after you’ve closed the main valve to check if you've successfully shut down the water supply.

Simply wrap it around the first item. Check to make sure you've covered the whole faucet."
