      "content": "A quarter of the animals on a farm have 4 legs, and the other 3 quarters have 2 legs. If there are 60 legs total, how many animals are on the farm? Answer: 24 Explanation: If X is the number of 4 -legged animals and Y is the number of 2-legged animals, then use the equation (x • 4) + (y • 2) = 60. The equation simplifies to 4x + 2y = 60 You also know that X is ¼ and Y is ¾ of the total animals, then y = 3x. Substitute 3x in for Y, so the equation reads 4x + 2(3x) = 60 → 4x + 6x = 60 → 10x = 60. Divide each side by 10 to solve for X, so x = 6. Plug in the value of X to the original equation to solve for Y. 4(6) + 2y = 60 → 24 + 2y = 60 → 2y = 36 → y = 18. There are 6 animals with 4 legs, and 18 animals with 2 legs."

Answer: Abe weighs 120 pounds, Bill weighs 240 pounds, and Caleb weighs 360 pounds. Explanation: Use X for Bill’s weight to set up the formula ½x + x + 1½x = 720. Add the values to simplify the equation to 3x = 720. Divide by 3 to solve for X, so X = 240. Then, plug the value of X into each weight to find the values."
