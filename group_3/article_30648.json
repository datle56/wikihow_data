      "content": "Stand sideways against a high wall you can put chalk or tape on. Make sure you stand on a level floor or surface away from any furniture or wall decor for a safe jump. Choose a wall in a room with a very high ceiling, at a gym, or on the outside of a building so you have plenty of space to reach and jump. [1] X Research source Stand with your dominant side against the wall for a more natural jump and reach."

      "content": "Wrap your middle finger tip on your dominant hand in tape or chalk dust. Use a small piece of masking tape or double-sided tape you can easily stick onto the wall, or a chalk color that contrasts with the wall color. Use your middle finger since it’s your longest finger and will give you the highest reach and jump measurement. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Reach as high as you can and mark your reach height on the wall. Keep your feet flat on the ground and reach upward with your taped or chalked hand. At the peak of your reach, touch the wall with your middle finger and leave a mark with the chalk or tape, then measure its height with a tape measure . This is your standing reach. [3] X Research source Write down your maximum reach measurement before you move into your jumps."

Raise your arms over your head and throw yourself down into a squatting position, then jump straight up as quickly as you can. Reach as high as possible and mark the wall again at the peak of your jump. [4] X Research source Remember to land safely on both feet to avoid injury. Try to position yourself so that your jump mark is directly above your reach mark. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Jump 3 to 5 more times with a 1 minute rest between each jump. Do multiple jumps in case you need a few tries to get used to the form or your first jump just wasn’t your best. Give yourself time to rest between jumps so your later jump measurements are affected by fatigue. [6] X Research source Remember to reapply tape or chalk to your finger and mark the wall each time you jump. Limit yourself to a handful of jumps. Otherwise, fatigue sets in and your measurements will continue getting lower. [7] X Research source"

The difference between these measurements is your vertical jump. [8] X Research source You now have 3 helpful measurements—your standing reach, your jump reach, and your vertical jump. If you only need your vertical jump and not your standing or jump reach, just measure the distance between your reach mark and best jump mark. Some people prefer to record the average of all their jumps instead of their best jump. [9] X Research source"

[11] X Research source A jump of 20–24 inches (51–60 cm) for men or 16–20 inches (41–50 cm) for women is considered an above average vertical jump.

Use a pole or stick nearby to turn the vanes outward (away from the Vertec pole) and align them evenly. If you don’t have a pole, lower the measuring apparatus and adjust the vanes by hand. [13] X Research source The vanes are the plastic flags or pegs at the top of the Vertec. They’re spaced out in 0.5 in (1.3 cm) increments. Consider placing weights around the base of your Vertec to stabilize it during your jumps. Most Vertecs or similar measuring equipment extend up to 12 feet (3.7 m) tall."

Reach up as far as possible with your dominant hand and tap the highest vane you can reach with your middle finger tip. Measure the height from the ground to this vane and record your standing reach. [14] X Research source Afterward, use your pole to move the vanes underneath your standing reach toward the inside of the Vertec to get them out of the way. Alternatively, raise the height of the vanes so that the lowest one is just barely above your middle finger tip when you raise your arm. [15] X Research source If preferred, measure your standing reach against a wall and subtract this measurement from your jump reach later."

If you’re too far away and have to move forward, gravity will pull you down slightly before you reach the vanes. [16] X Research source This also ensures your reach goes straight up instead of having to reach forward slightly."

At your peak, tap the vane with your middle finger to move it and mark your jump. [17] X Research source Make sure not to take any steps or get a running start before your jump. This leads to inaccurate measurements. Land safely on both feet to prevent injury."

Between every jump, use your pole to turn the vanes you tapped toward the Vertec, then straighten out the remaining ones for your next jump. Continue jumping until you’re unable to reach any more of them. Measure and record the height of the topmost vane you hit (this is your jump reach).

After measuring your highest jump, subtract your standing reach from earlier—the difference between these measurements is your vertical jump. If you raised the vanes to begin at your standing reach, count the number of vanes you moved. Each one represents 0.5 in (1.3 cm). [19] X Research source Divide the number of vanes by 2 to get your vertical jump in inches. Most Vertecs measure in inches, but there may be some that use centimeter increments."
