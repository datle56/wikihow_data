      "content": "Know how to prepare the okra for different dishes. There are different ways to prepare okra depending on how it is being cooked: Slice into even-sized pieces for Cajun and Creole stews (e.g., gumbo) that are thickened using okra after topping and tailing it. Cut into slices or leave whole for frying (see below). Leave whole (but cleaned and prepared) for stews and casseroles where the recipe requires this. If the okra is cooked whole, it is not able to release its gelatinous substance. [3] X Research source If using as a thickener, blanch the whole okra first. Slice the okra and add to the dish 10 minutes before cooking time finishes. [4] X Research source"
