      "title": "Infuse the oil for a few weeks.",
      "content": "Infuse the oil for a few weeks. The oil needs to infuse for a few weeks. You want to let it infuse for at least two weeks. You can set it on a sunny windowsill to let the sunlight heat the oil to help it infuse. [5] X Trustworthy Source Penn State Extension Educational organization dedicated to delivering science-based information to people, businesses, and communities Go to source Make sure to shake the jar every few days. Some people think letting it infuse longer is better for medicinal use. If you want to let it infuse longer, keep it infused for up to six weeks, but no longer. It could go bad."

    {
      "title": "Steep overnight.",
      "content": "Steep overnight. An alternate way to make this cough syrup is to let it set overnight. In a jar, put the oregano at the bottom, then the garlic, then lemon and onion. Pour the honey and water over the ingredients, making sure the water covers all the ingredients completely. Put the lid on the jar so it is airtight, and let it steep overnight. Strain the liquid the next morning and only drink the liquid. Store in your refrigerator for a week. This makes an even stronger cough syrup because the garlic and onion (if you add onion) are stronger and have more medicinal properties if they aren’t cooked."
