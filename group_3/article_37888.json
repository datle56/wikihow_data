      "content": "Perform regular maintenance on washers and dryers. You will have to maintain the washer and dryer according to the type of machine. For a washer-extractor , it is important to inspect the door lock and the water inlet valve hoses and connections on a daily basis. At the end of every day, the door should be left open to allow for moisture evaporation. For top load and front load washers , the lid should be left open after each use to prevent unseemly smells. On a monthly basis, all hoses should be checked and replaced if there are any visible cracks or other wear and tear. The filter screens in the fill hoses should be monitored annually for debris or damage. For tumble dryers , the lint compartment should be cleaned daily, and the cylinder should be monitored for any foreign objects on a daily basis. The exhaust duct should be checked monthly for any lint or other debris. The tumbler will need to be cleaned by an authorized service representative every year. For regular dryers , the lint screen should be cleaned before every load (it also helps to annually remove the lint filter and vacuum the duct under it). The exhaust duct should be monitored every 1 to 2 years as needed. The outside weather hood should be checked frequently to ensure that the dampers are working properly. An annual cleaning by an authorized service representative is also recommended."
