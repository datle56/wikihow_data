This piece lines up with the edges of the neckline, so it is important to choose the right size and cut along the lines on the pattern. Use a sharp pair of fabric scissors to cut the fabric along the pattern's lines. [1] X Research source Go slowly to avoid creating any jagged edges."

Then, turn it so that the right (print or outer) side of the fabric is facing down towards the right side of the neckline. Pin the raw edges of the neckline and the neckline facing together so that they are even. Insert 1 pin perpendicular to the seam about every 2 to 3 in (5.1 to 7.6 cm) going all the way around the edge.
