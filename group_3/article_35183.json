      "content": "Reading minds is piecing together cues to figure out what a person is thinking. It isn’t quite telepathy—or using some kind of supernatural power to read people’s exact thoughts—but it is about having what some psychologists call “empathic accuracy,” where you’re clued in to how another person is feeling. [1] X Research source These cues can come from another person’s body language, their backgrounds, and paying attention to the details and style in which they say things. For example, someone might cross their arms when they're angry or upset. [2] X Expert Source Kelli Miller, LCSW, MSW Psychotherapist Expert Interview. 11 June 2020. Some scientists also refer to “mind-reading motivation,” which is a skill that allows people to better understand the mental states of others. [3] X Research source For example, someone with high mind-reading motivation might notice their colleague is anxious because they keep drumming their fingers."

      "content": "Reading minds is also called “mentalizing.\" We actually do this all the time—you probably try to figure out what someone else is thinking at least a couple times a day. You may not even be fully conscious of doing this—mentalizing can happen even when you’re thinking of something completely different. [4] X Research source Being able to mentalize and understand other people’s emotional states can be a very valuable skill in the workplace, at school, or in your personal life. Anyone working in an area where they have to understand other people well—like diplomats, healthcare workers, or businesspeople—can benefit a lot from honing their mentalization skills. Studies have shown that women tend to be better at mentalizing than men. [5] X Research source People with autism may find mentalizing to be difficult. Many people with autism have strategies like practicing conversations ahead of time to manage their difficulties understanding other people’s emotions. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Listen carefully to both words and silences. When someone is speaking to you, ask yourself what the most important things they’re communicating are. Use active listening skills: avoid interrupting them, listen, ask questions, give them time to answer, and listen some more. [8] X Research source Deep conversations aren’t the only way to understand someone else. Small talk gives you a chance to see how someone acts normally and when they’re in a relaxed state. For example, if a friend seems bubbly and talkative when you’re discussing the weather, but takes longer to respond and gives you ambiguous answers when you ask them how their family is doing, family could be a difficult subject for them. You might say something like, “How is your sister?” and be met with a moment of silence before your friend responds “I think she’s doing good.” In this example, your friend might be having some relationship difficulties with their sister, since they said “I think” instead of “She’s doing good.”"

      "title": "Observe their body language.",
      "content": "Observe their body language. Reading body language is a key tool for understanding other people’s mental states, but it can take some practice to learn. Body language can reveal things about people that they don’t want to say, or that they may not even be aware of themselves. If someone is saying “yes,” but their body language says “no,” it can alert you that something is off.

While deductive reasoning starts from a premise and then tries to find evidence to support it (“he’s mad, so he’s looking at the ground”), inductive reasoning does the complete opposite (“he’s looking at the ground, so he may be mad”).

[27] X Research source People with social anxiety often struggle with using deductive reasoning instead of inductive reasoning. If you assume that people are judging you negatively and try to find a way to prove this, you aren’t mind-reading—this is just your anxiety talking. [28] X Research source"
