Most people just use an old cotton t-shirt or other soft rag, however it is also possible to get specific polishing brushes with stiff, short bristles. These brushes are included in most shoe polishing kits, which you may choose to invest in. You will also need an old toothbrush or some cotton swabs to works the polish into hard-to-reach areas."

[4] X Expert Source Penny Simmons Shoe Care Specialist Expert Interview. 19 November 2020. Otherwise the dirt could get trapped beneath the polish or scratch the surface of the shoes. Brush the shoe vigorously with your horsehair brush to remove any debris. [5] X Research source Alternatively, use a dampened cloth to wipe all around the surface of the shoe. Just leave the shoes to dry completely before moving on to the next step. At this point, you may also want to remove the laces from your shoes. This will give you easier access to the tongue of the shoe and will prevent any polish from getting on the laces. You can also clean your shoes with saddle soap or baby shampoo mixed with a little bit of water. Don't soak your shoes in the process, though!

Apply a medium pressure and make sure to coat the surface evenly, paying special attention to the toe and heel which get the most wear. [7] X Research source The easiest way to use an old t-shirt is to wrap the material tightly around your index and middle fingers and use them to work the polish into the shoes. Use a toothbrush or cotton swab to work the polish into the hard-to-reach places, such as the edge of the upper and the cracks in the tongue. You may also want to apply polish to the sole of each shoe, in the space between the toe and heel which doesn't touch the ground. Try to apply the polish in a really thin layer.

      "content": "Allow the polish to dry and add additional layers, if necessary. Once you have applied polish to the first shoe, set it aside on the newspaper and begin working on the second shoe. Each shoe will require about 15 to 20 minutes drying time. [9] X Research source If you feel like your shoes require another layer of polish, apply this second layer using the same technique as above. Remember to use the minimum amount of polish necessary to cover the shoe. It is better to build-up multiple light layers than apply a single thick layer."

      "content": "Brush off the excess polish. Once any additional layers of polish have dried, grab your horsehair brush and remove the excess polish using short, quick strokes. Don't be afraid to put some elbow grease into it -- the heat generated from the vigorous brush strokes helps the polish to sink into the leather. Most of the movement involved in these strokes should come from your wrist. Keep the rest of your arm stationary while your wrist quickly flicks the brush back and forth. Make sure to evenly brush the surface of both shoes. When you are done, the shoes should have an even finish with a slight shine. If super shiny shoes are not your thing, you can stop here."

      "content": "Buff the shoes with a soft cloth. The easiest way to add shine to your shoes is to use a soft cloth -- such as a chamois or an old cotton t-shirt -- to buff the shoes. Place one hand on either end of the cloth and work it across the shoe in a brisk side-to side motion. Some people like to breath on the shoe (as if fogging a mirror) before buffing to increase shine. If you like, you can place the first shoe on a shoe butler (or on your foot) to make this process easier."

After you have applied the first layer of polish, spray a little water onto the shoes and work it into the surface of the shoe. Then dip the cloth in warm water and use it to apply a second layer of polish. [10] X Research source Keep repeating this process until you achieve the desired level of shine. Just make sure that you let each layer of polish dry fully before applying the next. Spit shining can be done using a soft cloth or a number of cotton balls."

      "content": "Try fire shining. Fire shining is a fun, if slightly dangerous, method of shining shoes. It involves lighting the shoe polish on fire for a couple of seconds, until it becomes melted and gooey. This melted polish is then applied to the shoes using the same technique as spit shining. Once you have applied several layers of the melted polish, you can take the fire play once step further by using your lighter to evenly heat the polish on the surface of the shoe, until it melts and achieves a wet look. Do not let the flame actually touch the shoe and move the lighter constantly, as if spray painting. Once the polish has evenly melted, allow it to dry. Apply one final layer of polish, then buff the shoes with a soft cloth to achieve a high-glass shine."
