      "content": "Draw a snowman. Take a pencil, ensure you're holding it properly and draw in the middle of a piece of heavy paper. The snowman will be made up of three circles with the largest at the bottom, getting smaller going upwards to the top. Give the head features with black spots. Draw a carrot for the nose. Make coal buttons on the body. Sticks on each side of the middle ball act as makeshift arms. Draw a hat and scarf."

      "title": "Paint the scene.",
      "content": "Paint the scene. Use watercolors or poster paints. Consider using a white plastic picnic plate as your palette. Dilute any colors you use slightly with water. Use a pointed brush for the details. Have a large plastic container to rinse your brush. Put out paper napkins or an old terry towel for wiping your brush. Dab your brush to lessen the amount of paint on it."
