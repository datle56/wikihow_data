Or maybe it's more a more general goal to be a better family member or a happier person. Either way, the path toward meeting your goals will be more clear if you take the time to do some deep thinking and preparation. [1] X Research source Make sure your goal is SMART: specific, measurable, achievable, realistic, and time-bound. If you have a specific goal in mind, plot out a course to help you reach it. Do research to find out what steps you need to take along the way. If it's helpful, create a schedule that will help you meet your goal. Give yourself a deadline for each step along the way. Whatever your goal, prepare to put in some time and work. Developing the mental strength to persevere takes a lot of practice, but you can start right now. Reader Poll: We asked 196 wikiHow readers what advice regarding setting goals they find most helpful, and only 7% of them said telling other people about their goals so they can support them. [Take Poll] Sharing your goals with others can be a great way to hold yourself accountable, but you can still achieve your goals while keeping them private."

      "content": "Get rid of self-doubt. The first hurdle you're likely to encounter is correcting the state of your own self-confidence. It's really difficult to make progress unless you believe you're capable of persevering. No matter how unobtainable your goals may seem now, you have the intelligence and power to get there. If your goal is to overcome problems and face life's troubles with grace, you can do that, too. [2] X Research source Think of obstacles you've overcome in the past. Likely, you've already dealt with some pretty tough things. Use those life experiences as motivation to persevere. [3] X Expert Source Kirsten Parker, MFA Mindset & Action Coach Expert Interview. 22 July 2020. Don't compare yourself to other people. Doing so will inevitably lead to self doubt. You have the power to persevere using your unique strengths and talents, and your process is going to be different from other people's. If there are things in your life that hurt your confidence, get rid of them . For example, if you tend to fall back on harmful habits like drinking, abusing drugs or eating only junk food, this will make it harder to see yourself as a person with the mental toughness to persevere. Take steps to end addictive behaviors and bad habits. Spend time doing things you're good at. Practicing your skills, like playing a sport, making art, cooking , reading, knitting, or gardening, is a great way to build up your confidence. Spend time doing things that make you feel satisfied and positive about life."

      "content": "Practice staying cool. Getting hung up on stressful but small incidents takes a lot of energy - energy that could be going toward something more productive. Part of persevering is mastering the ability to let go of the little things. It's a lot easier said than done, but you can start practicing right away. Next time you find yourself in a long line or a traffic jam, or you start to heat up over a silly comment someone made, practice staying chill using the following technique: [4] X Research source Think before speaking or acting. Give a few minutes to think it through before you do anything. Think about how small this issue is in the grand scheme of things. While you're thinking, feel the anger or irritation move through your body, then feel it subside. Take five deep breaths. Breathe so that your stomach distends when you inhale, then pulls in when you exhale. Breathe in through your nose and exhale through your mouth. Move on with your day, dealing with the situation in a cool and appropriate manner. If you're in a line, wait patiently for your turn (and don't berate the person working the desk when you get to the front). If someone made an annoying comment, respond with a smile and let it go. You have more important things to spend your energy on."

As you walk the path toward your goal, or just work on persevering in daily life, you might encounter people who question you or tell you that you won't get far. Don't let it weigh you down. Realize that people are usually negative as a result of their own problems and issues they're dealing with. [5] X Research source If the goal you're trying to reach is a big one, like climbing Mount Everest, you'll encounter people who tell you that you can't do it. This is all par for the course. Have faith in yourself, and think ahead to the moment when you'll be able to prove them wrong. If there are people in your life who are particularly negative and seem bent on preventing you from achieving, it's ok to either stop spending time with them or limit how much you see them."

Having a good grasp of your own personal values is how you figure out the best way forward in any given situation and keep you aimed toward your target. What are your core beliefs? What do you stand for, and how does that play out in your life? The answers to these questions don't come easily, but with each life experience, you'll get closer to understanding yourself and your view of the world. These things can also help: [7] X Research source Identify the times where you’re the happiest and the most fulfilled. You can easily determine what you value most based on the experiences.

Read up on a lot of different perspectives. Even if you feel very strongly about a certain issue, get the other side of the story. Gain as much knowledge as you can on subjects about which you care. If you're religious, delve deep into the teachings of your religion. Have conversations about ethics and morality. Meditate . Explore your own mind and learn how to listen to your conscience."

      "content": "Figure out if you're enjoying life. Perseverance can mean putting in countless hours of excruciatingly difficult or boring work. However, in the knowledge that you're putting in this time to meet your goals, life will have a predominantly positive tint. You're not just getting through life, you're making the most of it. If dread and resentment have creeped in, and you're not enjoying the challenge anymore, you might want to change your tack. [9] X Expert Source Kirsten Parker, MFA Mindset & Action Coach Expert Interview. 22 July 2020. Learn to enjoy the good and the bad on the journey of life. This is not to say that life won't sometimes be upsetting on the path to your goals. Over time you'll recognize the difference between temporary frustration and longer-term negativity. What tools do you have at your disposal to help yourself feel more positive? For example, you could make a weekly coffee or phone date with your best friend so you have someone to lend an ear when things are hard, or you could schedule time for a long run with your dog to give your mind time to relax."

When a big problem arises, it's so much easier to ignore it, sugarcoat it, or put off making a decision. Practice seeing obstacles for what they are so you can figure out the best way around, over or through them. [10] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Stay consistent when you’re faced with obstacles. You may lose motivation or you may question why you should keep going, but sticking with it will help guide you through any obstacle. Be truthful with yourself. If you've strayed from the path toward your goal, own up to it. For example, if your goal is to become a published author , and you haven't set aside time to write, face the facts instead of making excuses for yourself. Don't place blame where it doesn't belong. You haven't started your couch to 5k program because your boss gives you too much work, your kids have been keeping you up, or it's too cold outside - does this sound like you? Remember the power you have to take action in your life, and use it to move forward, even if you have to start again at square 1. Avoid escapism. Big problems can be temporarily eluded by turning to alcohol, TV, drugs, overeating, constant video game-playing - but only temporarily. If you find yourself putting things off until tomorrow because you're too busy to face what matters, the problem will just fester in the meantime."

Other people can be a huge help when it comes to making big decisions. If you know people who've been through it before, ask them how they handled the situation. Just remember to take other people's advice with a grain of salt, especially if they're somehow invested in the outcome. It may also be helpful to have a few role models - people in your life, celebrities, religious figures - with values that align with yours.

If doubt or confusion set in later, the knowledge that you acted according to your conscience will help you get through.

Taking daily measures to stay healthy will go a long way toward helping you persevere. Here are a few things to keep in mind: Eat a wholesome diet. Make sure you're getting plenty of nutritious, in-season vegetables and fruits. Eat whole grains, meat, and healthy fats. Try not to eat too many processed foods. Get plenty of sleep. A full night's sleep can make the difference between having a bad day and a great one. Get 7 to 8 hours nightly whenever possible. Move your body. Whether you like walking, yoga, running, biking, swimming, or another activity, move around as much as you can. Exercise puts you in a good mood and keeps you in shape for whatever life may throw at you. Trying a regimen of exercising for 30 minutes daily is a great place to start."

Understand that while your problems matter, they don't matter more than other people's. Gain a sense of how large the world is, and engage with it as much as you can.
