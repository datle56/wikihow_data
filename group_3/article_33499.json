      "title": "Play the first note.",
      "content": "Play the first note. Tune your trumpet before beginning the scale. Tune to a C (this will register as a Bb Concert pitch on tuner) in the staff, which is an open fingering (0). It is important to be in tune before playing the scale because every note will sound incorrect if you do not. If your tuner displays a positive value, your trumpet is sharp. Fix this by pulling the tuning slide (the slide to the right of the bell) out, and play the C again in order to test your new pitch. If the tuner displays a negative value, your tuning is flat, meaning you will have to push the tuning slide in. Adjust the tuning slide as needed until a value between -5 and +5 is displayed for your C. Start the scale by playing the G below the staff (this will register as a F Concert pitch on tuner, as shown below). This is fingered by pressing the first and third valve (1 3). The first valve is the valve closest to the mouthpiece, and the third valve is the valve closest to the bell. Buzz your lips somewhat slowly to play lower notes. Use a tuner to establish the correct pitch will help to make sure you are playing the correct note. It will register as a concert F on your tuner."

      "title": "Move up the scale.",
      "content": "Move up the scale. Play the next note, Ab, by pressing the second and third valve (2 3), and buzzing your lips slightly faster and slightly tightening your embouchure. Again, use your tuner to ensure you are playing the correct pitch. It will register as an F#. Continue on to A, fingered (1 2). Make sure to continue to buzz your lips faster as you move up the scale. The tuner will register this note as a G. Play a Bb, fingered (1). This will register as a G#. Play a B, fingered (2). This will register as an A. Play a C. This will be an open fingering (0), and will register as a Bb. This is a common tuning pitch for the trumpet, as well as most other brass instruments. Continue onto a C#, fingered (1 2 3). It will register as a B. This note is inherently sharp on most trumpets. To remedy this, push out your third valve slide. Using the finger resting in the ring located near the bottom of the trumpet, slightly to the left of the tuning slide, push outward to extend the slide, flattening the tone. Check a tuner to find the correct pitch. Play a D, fingered (1 3). This will register as a C. This note also requires the third valve to utilized as it is typically sharp on most trumpets. Again, consult with the tuner to find the correct pitch. Play an Eb, fingered (2 3). This will register as a C#. At this point you will be entering the staff lines. Play a E, fingered (1 2). This will register as a D. Play a F, fingered (1). This will register as an Eb. Play an F#, fingered (2). This will register as a E. Play a G, which is an open fingering (0). This will register as a F."
