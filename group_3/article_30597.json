      "content": "Grab a pair of jeans and lay them flat. Stretch them out over a solid, smooth surface that’s large enough to hold the entire pair of pants. If you’re trying to find your optimal inseam, pick a pair of jeans that fit you well and whose legs are your preferred length. [1] X Research source Measuring a pair of jeans works best if the jeans are properly fitted to your body type."

      "title": "Smooth the pants out and, if necessary, fold them in half.",
      "content": "Smooth the pants out and, if necessary, fold them in half. To get more accurate measurements, smooth out the jeans to remove any folds or creases. If they’re altering the jeans’ overall shape, button and zip the pants up. If the legs do not lie straight, making them difficult to measure, fold the jeans in half vertically so the legs are lined up."

      "title": "Measure your jeans from crotch to hemline.",
      "content": "Measure your jeans from crotch to hemline. Place the tip of a soft tape measure on the jeans’ crotch seam. Measure down in a straight line until you reach the hem of the pants. The number listed on your tape measure will be the jeans’ inseam. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Put on a pair of close-fitting pants.",
      "content": "Put on a pair of close-fitting pants. Measuring in large or baggy pants will make your calculations far too big, and measuring without pants will make it difficult to get accurate numbers. Instead, wear a pair of pants that sit close to the leg itself. If you plan on buying jeans using this measurement, wear pants similar in length to what you want to purchase. [3] X Research source If you do not own a pair of properly fitted jeans, measuring your own inseam will give you the information necessary purchase some."

      "title": "Take off your shoes.",
      "content": "Take off your shoes. Shoes add extra bulk and height that can mess with the length of your pants and throw off your measurements. To avoid this, remove your shoes so your feet touch the ground. Unless they’re extremely bulky, feel free to keep your socks on. [4] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Stand up straight with your back against the wall.",
      "content": "Stand up straight with your back against the wall. Slouching can throw off your measurements, so stand against a wall to make sure your posture stays good. Push your shoulders back and hold your torso up, keeping your back straight and tall. Keep your legs shoulder-width apart and make sure they’re straight, not bent. Your feet should be flat on the ground. [5] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Measure your leg from crotch to ankle.",
      "content": "Measure your leg from crotch to ankle. Hold a soft tape measure to your pants’ crotch seam, about 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5.1 cm) below your actual crotch. Measure down your inner leg until you reach the middle of your ankle. Your general inseam measurement will be listed on the tape measure. Remember to keep your legs straight, otherwise the measurement will not be accurate. [6] X Research source If you have trouble finding this measurement on your own, ask a friend or family member to help."

    {
      "title": "Look for jeans that match your measurements.",
      "content": "Look for jeans that match your measurements. When purchasing men’s jeans, look for inseam measurements on the back label. They will typically be listed with waist size first and inseam second, so a pair of pants marked 34x32 will have a 34 in (86 cm) waist and a 32 in (81 cm) inseam. Women’s jeans rarely list the inseam, so you may have to consult a store attendant, make a conversion using the brand’s sizing chart, or measure the seam yourself. Websites like Search By Inseam allow you to find the inseam measurements for popular pant brands."

      "title": "Add extra length if you plan on wearing the jeans with raised shoes.",
      "content": "Add extra length if you plan on wearing the jeans with raised shoes. Though compact shoes and sneakers won’t make a significant difference, high heels and similar shoes may. In general, add between .5 and 1 inch (1.3 and 2.5 cm) to your inseam measurement to accommodate raised shoes. If possible, measure your inseam while wearing the raised shoes to get a more precise number. [7] X Research source"

      "title": "Check the jeans’ material to see if it will shrink.",
      "content": "Check the jeans’ material to see if it will shrink. Over time, jeans made from cotton, linen, and wool may shrink, something that will affect the inseam. If purchasing a name brand pair, search online for information on how much you should expect the pants to shrink. If necessary, purchase pants with an inseam that is about .5 inches (1.3 cm) too large, giving the legs room to shrink. [8] X Research source"
