Food safety experts recommend that you do not wash raw salmon or other raw meat before preparing. Cooking the meat is more effective at killing bacteria, and rinsing the meat is likely to spread the bacteria onto your sink or other places in your kitchen. [1] X Research source Wash your hands with soap and warm water for twenty seconds after handling raw meat."

For an acidic marinade such as this one, based on lemon juice, keep the salmon in the marinade for no longer than 30 minutes. [2] X Research source Flip the salmon over once during this time to ensure that both sides of the fish are marinated."

      "content": "Cook the salmon. After the salmon has been marinated, it can be prepared in a number of ways. Two popular options are grilling the salmon wrapped in foil, or baking it on a foil-lined baking sheet. In either case, cook the fillets at 400ºF (200ºC) for about fifteen minutes. The salmon is ready when a fork can easily remove flakes from the surface. Flip the salmon halfway through the cooking process if you are grilling it."

If you continue to marinade past that point, the texture of the fish may be compromised. Because the marinade was in contact with raw fish, it should be discarded after use, or brought to a boil before using as a sauce."

      "content": "Prepare the glaze (optional). If you like, you can create a glaze to brush onto your salmon for additional flavor during cooking. A simple glaze that pairs well with this marinade is a mixture of 2 tbsp (30 mL) honey, 1 tsp (5 mL) soy sauce, and 1/2 tsp (2.5 mL) Sriracha. Feel free to experiment with the amounts until you find a flavor you enjoy, keeping in mind the glaze may seem overpowering when tasted on its own, rather that eaten on the salmon."

      "content": "Cook your salmon. Consider pan-searing your salmon to a temperature of 125–140ºF (52–60ºC) on each side. [5] X Research source If you do not have a thermometer, avoid overcooking by cooking only skin-side down, briefly cooking the flesh side for only 15–30 seconds once the salmon is opaque but still mostly juicy. The skin helps keep the salmon extra flavorful, seal in the juices, and it’s easier to cook. After cooking, you may eat the skin or remove it. You may also grill, bake, broil, or poach your salmon after marinading."

Various herbs are used to give flavor to the salmon, typically white pepper and dill, and the salmon is eaten raw after the curing process is finished. Note: because the salmon is never cooked, keeping preparation surfaces and tools especially clean throughout the process is highly recommended."

Once it has reached a mayonnaise consistency, stir in the chopped dill and season with white pepper and salt to taste.
