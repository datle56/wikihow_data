      "title": "Select a public carrier for the most economic shipping.",
      "content": "Select a public carrier for the most economic shipping. Use the United States Postal Service or your local public carrier for the most economic shipping options. Note that these shipping options will typically take a little longer to get there (about 6-10 business days) than private carriers. [1] X Research source Note that public postal carriers may have more restrictions regarding the size, shape, and contents of your package."

      "title": "Select a private carrier for the most flexibility on size and weight.",
      "content": "Select a private carrier for the most flexibility on size and weight. Use a private carrier that ships to Mexico, such as UPS, DHL, FedEx, or NEX Worldwide Express, to send large or unusually shaped packages. Private carriers can often get international packages to Mexico more quickly than public ones (about 2-3 business days), though they are typically pricier, too. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Crosscheck your item against the restricted imports list.",
      "content": "Crosscheck your item against the restricted imports list. Consult Mexico’s Secretariat of Finance and Public Credit website to find out if your item is prohibited from entering Mexico. These items cannot be imported into Mexico by mail or in person and will result in the rejection of your package. In certain circumstances, they could also result in fines or criminal prosecution. [3] X Research source You cannot send: narcotics; live predatory fish; degrading, sexual, or violent images of children; used clothing or footwear that are not your own; weapons; or ammunition. Note that certain medical products are heavily regulated and will need to be registered with the Mexican Secretariat of Health (SSA) if they are going to be resold in Mexico. Contact the SSA at peticionesciudadanas@salud.gob.mx for further direction if you are shipping medical products. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Adhere to your carrier’s country conditions for mailing.",
      "content": "Adhere to your carrier’s country conditions for mailing. Consult your carrier to determine if any items are prohibited from being sent to Mexico through their service. Many carriers have conditions beyond Mexico’s requirements for the type of items they accept in packages. These vary from carrier to carrier. [5] X Research source For the US Postal Service, for example, perishable food items, jewelry, currency, radioactive materials, work infringing on Mexican copyrights, lottery tickets, cosmetics, and more are not accepted in packages to Mexico. If you have questions, call your carrier and talk to a representative about your item. It’s best to find out ahead of time if your item will not be accepted rather than risk the packaging being rejected or destroyed."

    {
      "title": "Check the size and weight of your item against your carrier’s limits.",
      "content": "Check the size and weight of your item against your carrier’s limits. Look on your carrier’s website to determine any size requirements for packages being sent to Mexico. The US Postal Service, for example, does not accept packages to Mexico with a combined length and girth greater than 108 inches (270 cm). [6] X Research source The package typically must also be large enough to completely contain the bill of lading, any customs forms, postage, and additional markings for tracking and insurance, if desired."

      "title": "Check the value of your item against your carrier’s limits.",
      "content": "Check the value of your item against your carrier’s limits. Consult your carrier’s website to determine if there are any limits on shipping expensive items to Mexico. Even with insurance, it’s possible your carrier will not accept items of exceptional value. There are typically specific limits depending upon which country you’re sending to. [7] X Research source For example, the US Postal Service does not accept items with a value greater than $2,499 USD in shipments to Mexico."

      "content": "Choose a sturdy box with room for cushioning around the contents. Select a cardboard or corrugated fiberboard box to withstand shipping. Make sure there is at least 1 inch (2.5 cm) between the item and any interior side of the box to help avoid damage to your item in transit. [8] X Research source You can purchase boxes at your local carrier’s office, a home goods store, or recycle one."

      "title": "Create a bill of lading.",
      "content": "Create a bill of lading. Fill out a bill of lading, either in person at your carrier’s office or online. A bill of lading is effectively your receipt for the shipment and a contract for the shipping service. It also serves as title of ownership for the contents of your package. [13] X Research source Your bill of lading will often include your address, the type of delivery service, and the address of your recipient. Write Mexico after the destination city in your recipient’s address to avoid any potential confusion with local zip codes."

      "content": "Fill out any required customs forms. Complete all fields of the customs forms your carrier provides, including the contents of your package and its approximate value. Often you will need to itemize contents. It can be helpful to complete customs forms at your carrier’s office rather than online, so an agent can answer any questions. They can also offer tips on how to fill the forms to minimize delays to your package. [14] X Research source If shipping with the US Postal Service, for example, you will need to fill out PS Form 2976-B and place it inside a plastic envelope. [15] X Research source Depending upon your carrier, you may also need to include documents demonstrating a guarantee of payment for additional duties in case the Mexican authorities determine you’ve undervalued the contents of your package. Note that any goods entering Mexico are subject to inspection by the Mexican authorities. All items need to be in adherence with Mexico’s restricted imports list to avoid seizure."
