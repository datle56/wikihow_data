There's no reason to stay on a date with someone who doesn't feel safe to you, and there may be a very good reason to leave. If the person seems unstable, violent, or just makes you uncomfortable, don't stay just to be polite. Make a simple excuse and get out. You can say, \"I'm sorry, but I'm not feeling well.

Watch out for people who insist, who whine, or who relentlessly tease you when you go against them. If your date puts you down, even as a joke, they may be trying to manipulate you. If you are being disregarded, condescended to, or otherwise not treated as an equal, end the date and get out safely. Someone who flatters and pampers you might also be trying to manipulate you. If it feels like the praise comes only when you comply with their wishes, and dries up when you speak up for yourself, distrust them. This is not to say that anyone who treats you well is safe. People you trust can be perpetrators of sexual assault."
