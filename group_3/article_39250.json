Instead, you can click Copy Link to save the link to your clipboard so you can send it out manually. When a person edits your workbook and you're also editing the workbook, you'll see a colored outline represent their cursor, so when they are working on a cell, that cell will become outlined in their editing color. If someone adds a comment to a cell, you can see those comments by going to Review > Comments > Show comments . Otherwise, a purple flag will appear in cells with comments and clicking that cell will reveal the comment. If another person is editing the workbook at the same time as you, both of you have the ability to use the chat feature, which you'll find in the upper right corner of the page.
