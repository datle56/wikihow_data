    {
      "title": "Saw 2-3 secondary stems to the ground on mature plants.",
      "content": "Saw 2-3 secondary stems to the ground on mature plants. Cutting secondary stems will give you a fuller weigela plant. Locate 2-3 branches that are growing next to the main stem and use a hand-held pruning saw to cut the stems upward at a 45-degree angle. Saw the stems as close to the ground as you can. [1] X Research source This will divert the plant's energy to the main stem and new growth, which will promote stronger blooms."
    },
    {
      "title": "Cut off the tops of the seed pod branches.",
      "content": "Cut off the tops of the seed pod branches. Seed pods are left over after the flowers bloom and fall off the plant. They look like buds on the tips of the weigela branches. Use a pair of hand shears to cut the upper growth right above a lower hanging bud on the branch. [2] X Research source Do not cut more than 1/2 of the branches full length. Make the cut straight, right above a flowering bud. Cutting away old buds will promote the growth of new, stronger buds which will lead to more robust blooms the next year."
    },
    {
      "title": "Cut away dead or diseased branches.",
      "content": "Cut away dead or diseased branches. Look for light grey or brown branches that feel brittle or hollow to the touch. Diseased branches may also have spots or mold on them. Cut these branches down to the main stem, on a 45-degree angle, to make room for new growth and prevent potential disease from spreading. [3] X Research source If the center of the branch is brown or gray, the branch is dead."
    },
    {
      "title": "Prune off wispy branches.",
      "content": "Prune off wispy branches. If a branch looks weak or wispy, there's a good chance it will never develop flowering buds. Cut away these branches down to the main stem to promote growth in other parts of the plant. [4] X Research source Leave strong branches that have minimal offshoots and that are capable of growing flowers."
    },
    {
      "title": "Cut off branches that are rubbing against the main stem.",
      "content": "Cut off branches that are rubbing against the main stem. You should cut branches that are rubbing up against the main stem or crossing over, as they can damage the plant. Use a pair of hand shears and cut the branches down to the main stem. [5] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Prune 1/3 of the plant over several seasons to \"restart\" your plant.",
      "content": "Prune 1/3 of the plant over several seasons to \"restart\" your plant. Use rejuvenation pruning if you want to start over with your weigela shrub. Prune all the branches down to 1/3 each season until the shrub is 4–10 inches (10–25 cm) in height and there is only new branches left. This is a great way to restart your plant without having to purchase a new one. [6] X Research source You should rejuvenate prune in the late winter."

    {
      "title": "Prune weigela in the late fall or early spring.",
      "content": "Prune weigela in the late fall or early spring. Prune your weigela plant after the threat of frost is over, sometime in the late fall or early spring. You can prune the weigela before it blooms to promote more flowers this year or after it blooms to promote stronger growth during the next blooming season.

    {
      "title": "Never prune more than 1/3rd of the plant at a time.",
      "content": "Never prune more than 1/3rd of the plant at a time. Over-pruning a weigela plant can weaken or even kill it. Never prune more than 1/3rd of the entire plant in a single season. [8] X Research source If you need to remove a lot of growth, do it gradually over the course of several seasons."

    {
      "title": "Prune weigela once a year.",
      "content": "Prune weigela once a year. Weigela is prone to growing wispy and weak looking branches with a lot of offshoots. This can detract from the natural beauty of the weigela blooms. To prevent these types of branches from taking over your plant, you should prune it once a year. [9] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Use sharp, sterilized pruning shears.",
      "content": "Use sharp, sterilized pruning shears. Sharp shears will prevent damage to the weigela plant. Wipe down the shears with rubbing alcohol after each cut to prevent the transmission of disease to other plants. [10] X Research source If your shears are breaking or snapping the branches rather than cutting straight through, purchase new ones."

    {
      "title": "Prune branches above a bud to control the direction of growth.",
      "content": "Prune branches above a bud to control the direction of growth. An upward facing bud will continue to grow out and upward, while a downward facing bud will grow downward. Cutting the branch immediately above a bud will allow you to control the direction that it grows in. If you are pruning to maintain the look of your weigela plant, keep this in mind.
