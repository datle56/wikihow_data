      "content": "Use a fine-toothed louse comb to help identify living head lice. Head lice move quickly and avoid light. They also tend to stay close to the scalp. For these reasons, it can be hard to spot them while looking through the hair. A fine-toothed comb will be handy in a thorough examination, since it can trap the lice and pull them out of your hair. You can check for lice with either dry or wet hair. If you're checking with wet hair, wash and condition your hair before going over your hair with a comb. Use an ordinary brush to detangle your hair, then switch to the fine-toothed comb and start combing at the front middle of the scalp. Comb the hair from the roots to the ends, examining the comb after each stroke. Do this over your entire head. People with thicker hair may want to look for lice after washing their hair. In this case, using conditioner, or 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of olive oil, may make running the nit comb through your hair easier."

      "content": "Look for nits (head louse eggs) at the base of the hair shaft. Nits don't move, so they'll be easier to spot than adult lice. Pay careful attention to the areas behind the ears and near the base of the neck when checking for nits. Nits look like small, pearly-white bumps clinging to the shaft of the hair."
