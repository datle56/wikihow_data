      "content": "INTJ women are so brilliant that they, you, and everyone else knows it. INTJs have one of the highest college GPAs of all types, and they always seem to end up at the top of the pack in terms of academic and professional ability. You’ll catch an INTJ woman honing her intelligence even further through reading, independent studying, and pursuing intellectual goals like learning a foreign language. [2] X Research source INTJs also know that achievement doesn’t come from natural smarts alone. An INTJ woman is likely to be an excellent and meticulous note-taker that’s always prepared for their next challenge. You may spot an INTJ woman holding a bunch of books on a huge variety of topics—this personality type is extremely intellectually curious."

      "title": "An INTJ woman likes to rely on her own abilities for recreation.",
      "content": "An INTJ woman likes to rely on her own abilities for recreation. INTJs are naturally introverted, so they’d likely prefer independent sports or activities over working with a team that might end up disappointing them. INTJ women are especially excited by activities that allow them to track and beat their personal goals. [3] X Research source For example, if she seems really into hiking, long-distance running, swimming, or video games, she may be an INTJ."

      "title": "INTJs tend to treat fashion as a means to an end.",
      "content": "INTJs tend to treat fashion as a means to an end. On most days, an INTJ woman will likely stick to wearing minimalist clothing that doesn’t require too much thought or effort. Although INTJs can master anything, including fashion, an INTJ woman is unlikely to feel the need to work too hard on her clothing unless she has someone to impress—after all, she has bigger fish to fry. [4] X Research source For example, an INTJ woman will likely stick to wearing classic clothing styles and very little makeup. She might be wearing all black or neutral color clothes, simple accessories, and practical flat shoes. INTJs do understand that fashion choices can be important. Hillary Clinton, a famous INTJ woman, often chooses to wear pantsuits as both a trademark and a sign of professionalism."

      "content": "INTJs are introverts, more comfortable by themselves than with others. In social settings, an INTJ woman might be standing off to the side and be unwilling to draw attention to herself. This doesn’t mean that an INTJ lacks confidence—they just don’t always feel the need to expend their energy socializing over small talk in these kinds of situations. [5] X Research source A hallmark sign of an INTJ is that they can sometimes seem reluctant to offer praise to others, even if they’re happy with them. INTJs sometimes don’t realize that people need to feel appreciated. You might begin to suspect that a woman is an INTJ if she normally has a serious look on her face. This doesn’t mean she’s unfriendly, just that she’s not too focused on pleasing others."

      "content": "An INTJ woman is likely to surround herself with similar people. For an INTJ, friendship is best when it’s between equals. An INTJ woman wants to be around people who share her intelligence and ambition. [6] X Research source In friendship, INTJs prioritize independence. They want to give their friends space to grow and expect that space for themselves. You won’t catch them begging for a hangout."

      "title": "An INTJ isn’t likely to spend too much time thinking about dating.",
      "content": "An INTJ isn’t likely to spend too much time thinking about dating. INTJ women would probably prefer a job interview to a first date, since all the etiquette and courtship rituals that dating entails can seem bewildering to an INTJ. All INTJs, including INTJ women, can struggle when it comes to meeting the right partner, but when they do, it’ll likely be with someone who appreciates them for their remarkable strengths. [7] X Research source When it comes to love, an INTJ woman prioritizes clear communication above all else. If you think you might be dating an INTJ , you’ll probably have noticed that she expresses herself directly and expects you to as well."

      "content": "Good isn’t good enough for an INTJ. These types are called “the Masterminds” for a reason, and it’s because they’re intricate planners who expect their designs to go off without a hitch. An INTJ woman can be pretty tough on herself or others if a project she’s working on doesn’t meet her standards, which tend to be higher than everyone else’s. [8] X Research source In a grocery store, an INTJ woman will have a meticulously prepared list, move through her errands very quickly, and walk out confident she’s done everything right. INTJ women tend to be really into spreadsheets, since they appeal to their strong organizational tendencies."

      "title": "You wouldn’t describe an INTJ as warm and fuzzy.",
      "content": "You wouldn’t describe an INTJ as warm and fuzzy. INTJ women can have a darker view of human nature—they’re quite good at discerning the hidden motivations of other people, and as a result, they aren’t quite as happy-go-lucky as other types. People with more sensitive dispositions can see an INTJ woman’s worldview as depressing or dark, but for an INTJ, it’s just the truth. [9] X Research source For example, an INTJ woman might say something like, “Everyone is just out there for themselves,” and believe that people who don’t realize this are naive."

      "content": "INTJs are drawn to places that can recognize their talent. An INTJ woman can be quite competitive because she knows she has what it takes to win. As a result, you can find her working in places that have a lot of prestige and where other competitive strivers tend to congregate. [10] X Research source Professions with a lot of INTJ women include law, engineering, computing, and business. If you know a woman who’s excelling in a career in these fields, she may be an INTJ."

      "content": "An INTJ woman can be identified by her pet peeves. INTJs are all about efficiency—they want to get things working as quickly as possible, and are impatient with anyone or anything getting in the way. Disorganization, mindless rule-following, and micromanaging are all things that can get an INTJ woman really upset. [11] X Research source When an INTJ woman is frustrated, she can become quite angry and physically stressed. This might cause her introverted instincts to kick in, as she withdraws from whoever or whatever is making her upset."

      "content": "Figure out if someone is an INTJ by asking a few simple questions. It’s fairly straightforward to classify someone with the MBTI if you know what each of the components in a psychological type represents. Ask yourself or the possible INTJ the following questions: [12] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Do you recharge with alone time (introversion) or by being with others (extraversion)? An INTJ is introverted. Do you spend your time thinking about abstract ideas (intuitive) or your daily reality (sensory)? An INTJ is intuitive. Are you more interested in logic (thinking) or in emotions (feeling)? An INTJ is logic-oriented. Are you organized (judging) or do you have a more “let’s see what happens” approach (prospecting)? An INTJ is judging-oriented."
