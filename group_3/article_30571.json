Using a Philip’s screwdriver, remove the screws attaching the slide to the drawer. Depending on the hardware, you might find the slides on the sides or bottom of your drawer. [1] X Research source Most slides have a screw on each end to secure the device into place. Certain slides might have screws in the center of the hardware, as well. It’s easiest to do measurements by removing the bottommost drawer."

Use a tape measure to calculate the distance between the front edge of the open cabinet to the back wall. Once you’ve figured out the exact measurement, subtract 1 inch (2.5 cm) from the total to determine your slide length. If [3] X Research source Jot down the measurement on a separate piece of paper so you don’t forget it."

      "content": "Calculate the drawer’s length to complete your measurements. Examine the bottom of the drawer that you just removed. Extend the tape measure from the front edge of the drawer to the back edge. Take note of this measurement, as under-mounted slides need to be the exact same length as the drawer. [4] X Research source Under-mounted slides are attached in pairs beneath of the drawer."

      "content": "Choose a slide that best fits your furniture’s schematics. Examine the measurement of both your drawer and cabinet to determine the length that your slide will need to be. Traditional drawer slides range in length between 10 to 28 inches (25 to 71 cm), so use those measurements to select the best slide style. [5] X Research source For instance, if you’re planning on getting an extensive slide, you might want to invest in 28 inches (71 cm) slides. If you’d prefer to have a less-extended drawer, look into drawer slides that are closer to 10 inches (25 cm) in length."

      "content": "Pick a side-mount drawer slide if there’s a gap between your drawer and cabinet. Pull one of your drawers outwards so it’s separated from the main piece of furniture. Using a ruler or tape measure, calculate the amount of space between the outer edge of the drawer and the inner edge of the cabinet. [6] X Research source If there’s not a lot of space between these 2 areas, you might not be able to use a side-mounting drawer slide."

      "content": "Opt for a center-mount option if you don’t want your slide to be visible. Think about how you’d like your drawers to look after the slides are installed. Is visual design an important factor for you, or are you more concerned with functionality? If you’d prefer for the sides of your drawers to be bare, go for a center or under-mounted slide instead. [7] X Research source These types of slides are secured beneath the drawer. They’re a great option if you don’t want the hardware to be visible to the naked eye!"

Check the distance between the outside of the drawer and the inside of the cabinet wall. If your furniture is a bit more narrow, you might not have enough room for a side-mounted drawer slide. Next, see if there’s at least 0.5 inches (1.3 cm) of space between the bottom of the drawer and the bottom opening of the cabinet. [8] X Research source These slides are great for drawers that only have 0.19 to 0.25 inches (0.48 to 0.64 cm) of space between the drawer’s edge and the inside wall of the cabinet."

If you’d like to completely remove your drawer, invest in an overtravel style slide. If you’d prefer for the door to stay rigid, consider getting a ¾-extension slide instead. [9] X Research source Full-extension and ⅞-extension drawer slides are a happy medium for people who don’t like either extreme."
