      "title": "Observe facial expressions.",
      "content": "Observe facial expressions. Your partner may make several different facial expressions involving their eyes, lips, and mouth that will key you in to their mood or any signs of conflict. [1] X Research source Licking of the lips shows that your partner might be nervous or desiring something. Lifting of the eyebrows depends on the context, but could show your partner is surprised, uncomfortable, or skeptical about something. If your partner raises their eyebrows quickly and smiles at the same time, it could be a sign of attraction. Smiling without crinkles around the eyes is more of a fake smile and could mean your partner isn't really happy about something. Clenching the jaw, rubbing the neck, or furrowing the brow could mean your partner is stressed about something."

      "title": "Watch out for eye contact.",
      "content": "Watch out for eye contact. Maintaining eye contact is a sign of interest, connection, and intimacy. If your partner’s eyes dart around the room or behind you, they might be preoccupied with something else other than what you’re saying. Darting eyes can also mean your partner is anxious. [2] X Research source Keep in mind people know they have a tendency to shift their gaze when they feel anxious, so your partner may overcompensate by trying to keep their gaze fixed on you and blank. Your partner may also rub their eyes or touch their face near their eyes when anxious. [3] X Research source Your partner may also scan your body with their eyes. This is very clearly a sign of attraction and interest, particularly if they don't look away when you notice the scanning. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Pay attention to your partner's arms and hands.",
      "content": "Pay attention to your partner's arms and hands. Clenched fists and crossed arms may mean your partner is getting defensive about something. Pay attention to this particularly if you're arguing or if you're asking your partner to do something. However, if your partner’s arms are just lightly crossed or folded across their stomach, like when they are sitting, then your partner may actually be relaxed. [5] X Research source If your partner holds out their hands with the palms facing upward or outward, they are probably feeling relaxed, willing to communicate, and open. If your partner stands with their feet shoulder-width apart, stands up straight, and has an open posture, they’re demonstrating more confidence and power. [6] X Research source Similarly, if your partner stands with their hands on the hips, they are probably feeling more self-confident. [7] X Research source If your partner stands slumped down, legs crossed, and hands in their pockets, they are likely feeling tense, sad, or embarrassed about something."

      "title": "Observe how your partner sits.",
      "content": "Observe how your partner sits. A confident and relaxed sitting posture is one where your partner is leaning back with their legs unfolded and slightly open. If your partner is feeling more insecure, they will likely have their arms and legs folded in. The most common sitting positions you can watch out for are: [8] X Research source Sitting with legs splayed open show confidence and possible sexual attraction. Sitting with legs tightly crossed indicates that someone is closed off, nervous, or unreceptive. Crossed ankles may indicate that your partner is calm."

      "title": "Notice any fidgeting.",
      "content": "Notice any fidgeting. See if your partner fidgets while sitting or standing. Also pay attention to any fiddling of the hands or other objects. This behavior could be a sign of anxiety, boredom, or irritation. [9] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Notice the way your partner hold or touches their head.",
      "content": "Notice the way your partner hold or touches their head. If your partner tilts their head, then your partner is showing increased interest in you and what you're saying. If you notice your partner touching their face or playing with their hair, it could be that your partner is feeling comfortable. If you see your partner covering up their face or holding their head in their hands, then it may be that your partner is embarrassed or stressed."

    {
      "title": "Notice how you eat together.",
      "content": "Notice how you eat together. Pay attention to how you're sitting and interacting when you share a meal with your partner. Your partner will probably lean in, face you, and make eye contact with you if they are interested in talking or being with you. [10] X Research source Pay attention to these signs of disconnection or inattention from your partner: Your partner does not look up at you occasionally or acknowledge your presence. Your partner is already finished with their food and moving on to something else while you’re only halfway through eating. Your partner's back is turned toward you while you eat."

      "content": "Watch them during an argument. Partners in happier relationships show different body language during arguments than partners in unhappy relationships. Try to show you’re listening and keep your partner calm during an argument. [11] X Expert Source Maya Diamond, MA Master's in Somatic Psychology & Relationship Coach Expert Interview. 17 January 2019.

      "title": "Pay attention to how your partner relaxes with you.",
      "content": "Pay attention to how your partner relaxes with you. While you’re sitting down at night to watch television together, pay attention to your partner’s body, even if they are on the other side of the couch or in a different chair. Couples who are better connected and happier tend to be angled toward each other and glance at each other to check in. [12] X Expert Source Elvina Lui, MFT Marriage & Family Therapist Expert Interview. 15 March 2019. If your partner is feeling upset or like they do not want to talk, they may turn away from you and refuse to look at or acknowledge you. Holding hands can also be a good indication that your partner is expressing love and wants to be with you. For example, if your partner reaches out to hold your hand, then this indicates that they are seeking love or comfort from you. [13] X Research source"

      "title": "Look into your partner’s eyes during sex.",
      "content": "Look into your partner’s eyes during sex. If your partner’s pupils are open, then look at them to see if their pupils are dilated. Your partner’s pupils will dilate if they are excited, so this can offer a clue about how they are feeling. If you notice that your partner has their eyes closed tightly shut for most of sex and seems tense, especially in the neck and shoulders area, then it could mean that your partner is anxious or not wanting to be intimate. Keep in mind it’s okay if the eyes close naturally sometimes during sex, but notice if your partner takes time to look into your eyes."

      "title": "Observe your partner's pace while walking with you.",
      "content": "Observe your partner's pace while walking with you. Exercising together can have many benefits and it can also make you feel closer to your partner. [14] X Research source Couples that are well connected and happy together tend to keep a similar pace. Notice if your partner walks ahead of you and faster than you often. Also notice if your partner fails to let you know if they're about to turn or change direction. Try to hold hands with your partner when you walk. This will help keep you connected. If your partner is deliberately not matching their pace with yours or refusing to hold your hand, then it could mean that something is up."
