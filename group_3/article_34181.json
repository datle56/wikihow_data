      "content": "Don’t overload sockets. Many older homes contain electrical systems, which aren't properly equipped to handle modern power demands. Don’t tempt fate by plugging too many devices into the same socket. Never plug more than two appliances into an outlet at once. Using extension cords to plug multiple appliances into one outlet, is also strongly discouraged. Large appliances such as your refrigerator should have an outlet to themselves. Contact a professional if you hear a sound coming from the outlet or smell something burning. Cover unused sockets with a socket plug. This is particularly important if there are small children in the home."

      "content": "Have your electrical wiring checked. Dangers from electrical shock and fire are so concerning that when it comes to the construction industry, electrical wiring is very closely monitored. Even still, things can deteriorate over time. This is particularly true in older homes but applies to newer homes as well. It may be a good idea to have a licensed electrician inspect your home if you've never had your wiring inspected. [1] X Research source If the lights are flickering or some of the outlets don’t function properly, this could be a sign of an electrical issue. Contact a professional to come in and inspect the house. Though it is not advisable, should you decide to inspect the wiring yourself, make sure to turn off the circuit on your breaker panel!"

      "content": "Stop using appliances with frayed power cords. You may not realize it, but power cords have several layers. Visible damage at the outer layer of a power cable, whether that’s pinching, tearing, or frays, is probably a good indication of damage to the inner layers as well. [2] X Research source Do yourself a favor and stop using the appliance if this happens. If the appliance needs to be used until a replacement is found, you can temporarily fix the cord with electrical tape. However, it is not advisable to do this, as fires and short circuits could still occur. If you can’t bear to part with the appliance, have the power cord replaced by an electrician as soon as possible. Most importantly, if you suspect damage has been done to the middle layer of a power cable, you need to stop using it immediately. [3] X Research source"

Grease fires are often the culprit of kitchen fires, so never leave a pan unattended when you're frying fat. [4] X Research source If you need to leave the kitchen, turn off the stove and remove pots and pans from the hot burners. Treat the microwave the same as a stove.

When you are using them, make sure they are not resting on something that can easily be pulled down. Get in the habit of placing knives on a flat, clutter-free surface to ensure they won’t accidentally fall. Knives should be stored, blade down, in a designated container, far from the reach of children. Dirty knives should not be left in the sink. Instead, immediately wash the knife after each use. When carrying knives, keep the cutting edge angled away from your body and leave the tip facing your side. Do not attempt to carry knives while there is a lot of commotion in the kitchen."

One idea is to establish an off-limits area, which encompasses any hot appliances such as the stove, fireplace, barbecue, heaters, etc. Never allow your child to carry hot items. It may be wise to restrict them from playing with pots and pans when they’re not in use. This will help to avoid any confusion when they are on the stove."

Make sure alarms are installed in bedrooms and on every floor of your house. Alarms need to be replaced every ten years, so remember to keep track of when they were installed. Get in the habit of testing your alarm every month or so. Do not change or alter the alarm in any way; that includes leaving it unpainted, regardless of whether it stands out! Spring ahead and fall back - you may want to consider changing the batteries on your alarm every time you change your clocks. Many people commonly change their batteries every fall during daylight savings time. This is also a good time to test fire alarms. [6] X Research source"

It not only saves lives but can aid in reducing property damage. Owning a fire extinguisher is just as important as knowing where it is located. Try to keep it in the same spot and to inform your family members of its whereabouts. It may make sense to keep the fire extinguisher in your kitchen at least 30 feet away from your stove, as this is where many fires start. Read the instructions after purchasing a fire extinguisher and familiarize your family members with how to work it. To operate a fire extinguisher, remember the word PASS: Pull the pin. Keeping the nozzle pointed away from your body, hold the extinguisher and release the locking mechanism. Aim low. Aim the extinguisher at the base of the fire, as opposed to the top. Squeeze the lever slowly and evenly. Sweep the nozzle from side-to-side. It's very important that you only use a fire extinguisher if the fire is small. Do not try to manage a fire that has spread throughout your house."

One minute or two doesn't give you enough time to formulate a plan, which is why it’s so important to have one in place. Prior to creating the plan, walk around the home and point out all exits. Establish a meeting location outside of the home. If there are children in the home, indicate which adults should get the kids. If the children are older, you may want to draw a map of the house, indicating exit points. Make sure everyone knows the plan and try to review it every couple of months."

[7] X Research source Similarly, return cleaning products to their spot immediately after use. Do not leave them lying around while you’re cleaning. Have a plan in place for medicine brought into the house by visitors. It may help to have a cabinet installed in the guest bathroom that is out of reach from children.
