      "content": "Use a high-quality razor to remove coarse pubic hair. Opt for a razor with new, sharp blades to prevent chafing, bumps, and ingrown hairs. Generally, men’s razors are recommended for shaving coarse hair since they’re sturdier and ideal for sensitive skin. However, you can purchase bikini-line-specific women’s razors, too. [1] X Trustworthy Source American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists Professional association of OB/GYNs focused on education and public outreat initiatives Go to source Depending on how frequently you shave, a razor blade can last 5 to 10 shaves before needing to be replaced. Contrary to popular belief, single-blade razors can be used—as long as it’s the stainless steel safety razors. They’re more durable and sharp and can remove hair with only one pass and less trauma to the skin surface. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Trim the hair to 1 ⁄ 4 inch (0.6 cm) before shaving. To prevent overgrown hair from getting tangled in the razor, prep your hair with hair scissors or an electric trimmer for a closer shave. Gently pull the hair up and away from your body with one hand and use the other to trim it carefully. Trim in a well-lit area to avoid poking or cutting yourself. [3] X Research source If you’re unsure how much hair to remove, put your bikini bottoms on to see where the hair would be exposed. This will help determine where you should shave, too. A bikini-line trim includes the upper thighs, groin, and below the belly button. Companies now make bikini-line electric trimmers that are waterproof or water-resistant."

      "content": "Rinse in hot water for 5 minutes to soften the hair. To make shaving easier, soften your skin and hair by taking a nice hot shower or bath. Shaving should be the last step of your shower process to give your skin enough time to soften. [4] X Research source If you’re not shaving in the shower, moisten the area with a hot washcloth for 5 minutes. Skipping this step could result in a razor burn or further discomfort."

      "content": "Apply light, even strokes as you shave with the grain. Shaving in the same direction of hair growth results in less skin irritation. Use one hand to hold the skin taut and the other to shave the hair away. You may want to rinse the hair away with water to see how much progress you’ve made. Reapply shaving cream to keep shaving. [7] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Dermatology Professional organization made of over 20,000 certified dermatologists Go to source If going with the grain is difficult, try going at it sideways. Shaving against the grain should be a last resort. Avoid over-shaving a hair-free area to limit skin irritation. If you want to remove more public hair, use the same method of pulling the skin taut. Work slowly to avoid cutting yourself. For completely bare skin, consider giving yourself a brazilian wax with hard or sugar wax."
