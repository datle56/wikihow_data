Awful. Screwing up in front of your best friends? Laughable! Imagining that you’re speaking in front of people you love can help you feel more at ease and lessen those performance jitters. Make your vision a reality by asking a friend to sit in the front row. This way, you can look to them whenever the nerves rise.

[11] X Research source Record yourself while you’re practicing and watch or listen to it back to see where you can improve. This can help you be more confident , as you’ll know exactly what you’ll look and sound like.

[12] X Research source Aim to get to where you’re performing, speaking, or presenting earlier. The earlier you arrive at the venue, the more time you’ll have to set up and get comfortable.
