      "content": "Throw out a witty or cheeky response to make the other person laugh. Poke fun at your “hotness” or use self-deprecating humor to convey that you don’t take yourself too seriously. It’s the perfect way to showcase your sense of humor , add a playful touch to the conversation, and accept the other person’s compliment! Thanks, fan! Thanks, it’s genetic. 310 Kelvin all day 🫡 A healthy 98.6 indeed. Wow, keep ‘em coming. Thanks, it’s the stress glow. I’ll be sure to tell my parents. Oh, stop! But also, keep going… Oh no, not you falling for me too! I try. It’s a lot of pressure, though. Thanks, it’s my secret weapon in life. Was it my hair or my obvious charm? Only on Fridays. Check back tomorrow. Yeah, the genie finally granted my wish. Finally, someone recognizes my efforts! Thanks—many lives were sacrificed for it. BRB updating my bio with this compliment. I didn’t catch that. Can you say that again? 😂 I’ll try not to set off any fire alarms with this heat! It’s all part of my master plan to get your attention. That’s why I avoid plastic. Melting hazard, you know? I know, my thermostat has been yelling at me all day! Wait until you see me holding a puppy…off the charts! Well, you haven’t seen me first thing in the morning yet! Why, thank you. I was forged in the fires of Mount Doom. Don’t worry, global warming should cool me down eventually. So, how hot are we talking? Like “cute hot” or “I need a fan hot?”"

      "content": "Reciprocate their compliment in a playful way to convey mutual attraction. If you want to get the sparks flying, tease the other person and let them know that you find them attractive too. It’s a fun way to crank up the heat and take the conversation to the next level. Gopman says you can “use emojis to flirt through text,” as long as you don’t overuse them. So, throw out a playful wink (😉), smirk (😏), or other flirty emoji to keep things exciting! You too 😉 Only for you 😘 Right back at ya! You’re one to talk. Not as hot as you. Look who’s talking! You’re bringing the heat. It takes one to know one. You’re not so bad yourself! Well, that makes two of us. Flattery will get you everywhere. I’d look better with you beside me. If this is how you flirt, I’m in trouble. Only because you’re looking at me. I bet you say that to all the girls/boys. Guess we’d be the perfect match then. Just imagine how hot we’d be together. So…what are you going to do about it? If you’re trying to win me over, it’s working. You should see me when I’m all dressed up. Big words coming from someone as sexy as you. Are you usually this forward, or am I just special? And I thought you were the one bringing the heat. Thanks—you’re making it hard for me to play it cool. If you think I’m hot now, wait until you get to know me. You’re not bad at compliments. Keep practicing on me. I would say the same thing about you, but I don’t want to inflate your ego 😏"

      "content": "Drop a sassy reply to show off your confidence and spice up the convo. Responding to “you’re hot” in a sharp and sassy way is sure to keep the other person on their toes. Just make sure to keep things light and flirty so the other person knows you’re not being mean-spirited. If you’re texting, for instance, you could throw out an emoji. If you’re talking to them in person, you could flash a playful wink or smirk. The goal is to own your confidence, without being cocky! Facts. I know. I get that a lot! I aim to please. Glad you noticed. So I’ve been told. Hotter than your ex, right? It’s a blessing and a curse. Is that the best you’ve got? Well, I won’t argue with that. You’re just now realizing this? Stunning is my middle name… Tell me something I don’t know. Wow, someone has good taste. Took you long enough to notice. I was waiting for you to say that. Careful—I might melt your screen. I mean, I do have a reputation to uphold. Yeah, it’s exhausting being this attractive. I’m basically a walking fire hazard at this point. Tell me something I haven’t heard 20 times today. I mean, it’s basically my part time job at this point. Being this hot is a hassle, but someone’s gotta do it."

      "content": "Express gratitude and give a genuine compliment in return. Even if you’re not romantically interested in the other person, you can still reply in a kind way and show appreciation for their attention. Acknowledge their compliment with warmth and friendliness, and throw out a sincere compliment if you feel inclined. I think you’re really attractive too! Stop—you’re making me blush 😊 Aw, I think you’re pretty hot yourself. Well, aren’t you a charmer? Thanks! You’re not so bad yourself, you know. Aw, thanks! You just made my day ☺️ I can’t stop smiling now, thanks to you! Thank you ! I could say the same about you! Thanks! But honestly, you’re just as stunning! Aw, thank you. I think you’re a total catch too! Well, I guess I’m in good company then, huh? You’ve got quite a way with words. Thank you. Thanks, you’re really making me feel like a 10. Thank you, you’re pretty easy on the eyes yourself. You’ve got a way of making people smile, don’t you? I appreciate that. You’ve definitely brightened my day! You’re too kind! I can see why you’re turning heads too. Thanks, you’re giving me the boost of confidence I need."

      "content": "Thank the other person for their compliment to be polite. If you’re stuck on what to say or don’t feel the same way toward the other person, keep your reply short and sweet. You don’t need to say much in response, and a sincere “thank you” works in any situation! Thanks! That’s very sweet. Aw, I appreciate it! That’s very nice to hear. You’re too kind, thank you. Wow, thank you. I’m flattered! That’s very nice of you to say. Thank you for the compliment."

      "content": "Embrace their compliment and suggest meeting up to show interest. If you’re trying to flirt over text, Gopman says to “leave a little bit of mystery” and “keep the conversation fun and lighthearted so the [other] person is interested.” A great way to do this is to throw out a playful joke, or compliment them back in a subtle way. To get the ball rolling, suggest that there’s more to discover about you in person and ask them out! You should see me in 3D. Thanks, I look better in person. Hot enough for you to plan a date? Hot enough to be worth a super like? I’ll take that as an invitation for drinks. It must be the filters working overtime. You’ve got my attention—what’s next? So, when are we testing out this heat IRL? So, does that mean I get your number now? Are you hitting on me? Because it’s working. If I’m hot, you’re basically a human inferno 🔥 Honestly, it’s just good lighting and seven filters. It’s all in the angles. In person, I’m 75% less hot. Guess we should test out this chemistry in person. You’re just saying that because I have a dog in my profile. Thanks! How about we meet up and keep this energy going? Careful—compliments like that might get you a date with me. If you think my pics are hot, wait until you meet me in person. Pssssh, you’re only saying that because I swiped right first 😉 I could give you a tour of this hotness, but it might be too much."

      "content": "Use open body language and make eye contact. Body language can reveal your true feelings toward someone, especially when it comes to showing genuine appreciation for their compliment. Be sure to keep your arms uncrossed, maintain a relaxed posture, and lean forward to express interest and attentiveness. If you want to be flirty, Gopman says to “smile” and maintain “strong eye contact” to show that you’re present in the conversation."

      "content": "How should you respond to \"you're hot\" if you're in a relationship? You can still accept the compliment if you want, but make it clear that you're in a relationship so the person doesn't continue to pursue you (and to protect your partner's feelings). You could also try to make a lighthearted joke to avoid any awkward feelings. You might say something like: \"Thanks! I appreciate that, but just so you know, I'm in a relationship and not looking to get involved with anyone else right now.\" \"Thanks! My boyfriend thinks so too.\""
