      "content": "Open the .htaccess file on your web server. If the URL is moving permanently, you can use a 301 redirect to send traffic to a different URL. If you manage your website by editing files manually, you can create your redirect in a file called .htaccess . The file is usually in your website's root directory (typically called public_html , htdocs , or www ). Download the file and open it in a text editor like Notepad for Windows or TextEdit for Mac, or edit it directly on the server if you have access to do so. If there is no .htaccess file, your web server may not be an Apache server. Contact your web host for instructions on creating a redirect. If the redirect is temporary, you can create a 302 redirect. Just replace 301 in our examples with 302 to indicate that the URL redirection is not permanent. If your website uses WordPress, you can use this method if you can edit your web server configuration files by hand."

Now that the rewrite engine is enabled, you can add your redirects just below the line \"RewriteEngine On.\" If you only want to redirect a particular page or directory on your website to another location, add a redirect like this: <IfModule mod_rewrite.c> RewriteEngine On Redirect 301 /oldpage https://example.com/newpage </IfModule> \"Redirect 301\" indicates that we're doing a 301 (permanent) redirect. After that comes the path to the directory on your webserver (or the file) that you're redirecting elsewhere. Last is the URL you're redirecting to . In the above example, all visitors to the /oldpage directory on the website will be routed to the /newpage directory of example.com. You can redirect files (e.g., index.html) and directories (e.g., /about/) to local or remote directories. For example, to redirect https://mywebsite.com/oldpage/index.html to https://example.com/newpage/), you'd use Redirect 301 /oldpage/index.html https://example.com/newpage/) . You can also redirect a URL to another file on the same web server—just leave out the domain name on the second part of the redirect. For example, if you changed the name of index.html to home.html, you can redirect Redirect 301 /index.html /home.html ."
