Then, vacuum or blot the area with a clean, dry towel to absorb any remaining moisture. Let the carpet finish air drying, then repeat if any urine remains.

Keep children and pets away from the area until the carpet is completely dry. This can take anywhere from a few hours up to a couple days. Enzyme cleaners are available as sprays and powders , so choose the option that works best for you. Cleaning expert Laura Smith says, “Any sort of enzyme product is made to essentially eat urine. The one that I really like is called Backout, and it is just a natural enzyme cleaner. It smells really good, like lime.” [5] X Expert Source Laura Smith House Cleaning Specialist Expert Interview. 26 May 2022."
