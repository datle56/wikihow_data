      "content": "Make eye contact when you speak to her. It not only lets her know that you’re listening, but it also gives her the feeling that she is worth your undivided attention. Eye contact creates tension and attraction. Try to hold her gaze for a while without breaking it -- even if there are distractions around. Ignore them. She will be impressed that you didn’t let the chaos around you distract you from her. Then, she’ll be more likely to open up to you. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Mimic her body language.",
      "content": "Mimic her body language. If she leans forward, you lean forward. If she steps to the side, you step to the side. Mimicking her body language is a subtle way of letting her know that you are into her. Even if she is consciously unaware of this, subconsciously she may start to pick up the signal. [2] X Research source Watch her body language as well to see if she mimics you. Mimicry is a sign that she is warming up to you even if she is not quite ready for flirtatious touching just yet.

      "title": "Get to know her.",
      "content": "Get to know her. Think about what she likes and her interests. Ask her if you're not sure. Understanding her interests helps you find common ground so that you have a reason to see and talk to her, which brings you one step closer to physically flirting with her. [4] X Expert Source Laura Bilotta Dating Coach & Matchmaker Expert Interview. 4 March 2020. As you get to know her, be kind and considerate or she might not let you get much closer. Go slow. If you walk up and put your arm around a girl without knowing her well or flirting first, she might get offended and think you’re too forward. Flirting gradually over a period of time -- even if it is a short period of time -- is the best way to get a girl to go out with you."

      "content": "Compliment her. Compliments give you the ability to let her warm up to you so that you can get close to her physically. When you talk to her, give her a compliment about something she's wearing that sounds genuine. [5] X Expert Source Laura Bilotta Dating Coach & Matchmaker Expert Interview. 4 March 2020. Otherwise, she might think you’re trying to \"game\" her. Girls like compliments as long as it doesn’t sound like a pick-up line. Superficial compliments might make her shut down and not want to talk to you. [6] X Research source Give compliments that are unique to her and be specific. For instance, compliment her cute ears, freckles or eyes. Remember that a lot of girls -- even the pretty ones -- are very insecure. When you try to compliment her, she might not take you seriously because she thinks you are joking. So, reassure her that you’re not. Don’t neg her or give her a backhanded compliment. “You’re pretty for a brunette” is not a compliment. [7] X Research source Never make her the object of a joke, and if people say something rude -- even if they're teasing -- tell them to stop. Then, quickly glance at her. If her eyes get bigger or if she smiles slightly, then she is impressed and thankful. Reader Poll: We asked 440 wikiHow readers how they prefer to let a girl know they think she’s cute, and 63% of them said giving a casual compliment with a light smile. [Take Poll]"

      "content": "Give her attention in a crowd. Sometimes girls can feel lost when they are standing in a large crowd or even if she is standing amongst friends -- especially if her friends are attractive. She might think that some of her friends get more attention than she does because they are prettier or more outgoing, which means it can be difficult for her to feel like she is being seen and heard. So, make her feel like she is standing out from the others by giving her more attention. [8] X Expert Source Laura Bilotta Dating Coach & Matchmaker Expert Interview. 4 March 2020. When she speaks, pay special attention. Make a point to talk to her directly instead of speaking to others. When the group is making a decision about where to go or what to do, ask her what she thinks the group should do."

Calling her just to chat -- especially since texting is far more popular -- lets her know that you really are interested in getting to know her better. [9] X Research source Chat about her interests or current events. Or, just give her a hello and a short chat to let her know you’re thinking about her.

Make sure that you come off like an observant person and not a creepy stalker who likes to watch her. Don't be put off if she refuses your gift. She may not want to immediately accept something from you. She doesn’t want to feel as if she is indebted to you because you gave her something. If you ask a couple of times, she may eventually give in and accept it."

If she agrees to meet you, don't comment on any other girls or talk about subjects that would make her think you aren't interested-- unless you know she likes those subjects.

Make sure that you touch her knee gently and then linger, so she doesn't think that you are bumping her leg because you need more room for your legs. Flirting by accidental touch helps build attraction because it creates tension. Small touches here and there leaves her wanting more. But remember to keep your eyes open for mutual signals.

It may seem like playing footsie is a little childish, but it is a way to get a girl’s attention in a playful manner while also letting her know that you’re interested.

If you do this every time you see her, she will begin to understand that hugging is the way that you greet her. [15] X Research source You could possibly get a hug every time you see her. If you want to take it a step further, hug her more frequently. Give her hugs for no reason if you know her fairly well. With time, this may escalate and she might start giving you hugs. However, also keep in mind that some people just don't like hugging. So, it is important to pay attention to her body language and facial expressions. If she doesn't like it, stop; and of course, if she tells you to stop, you should stop immediately."

If she is comfortable with you, play with the hair close to her torso or bustline. (Be respectful though.) [16] X Research source From there if the girl is still comfortable, take it a little further. With the back of your hand, gently push the hair hanging in front of her shoulders behind her shoulders. (Please don't do this if it looks like the girl worked a long time to style her hair. Even if you are just trying to flirt with her, she will get mad at you for ruining her hair.)

Lean in and whisper something in her ear, or just say it outright. You’ll be able to tell if she liked it by the expression on her face.

Overt touching should be consensual, and some people are uncomfortable with public displays of affection or being touched at all. Everyone is different, so it is very important to pay attention to her verbal and non-verbal cues. If she says, \"stop\" at any point, then stop. If she looks uncomfortable, stop. She'll view it as harassment because it can be viewed by her as unwanted advances. This is not attractive or respectful."
