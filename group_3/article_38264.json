However, confidence doesn't happen overnight and you have to build it with a series of daily rituals and routines. Make a habit of saying nice things to yourself. Focus on your strengths and constantly remind yourself of your best traits. For example, you might look at yourself in the mirror every once in awhile and say, \"I'm a caring, compassionate person and I deserve to feel confident.\" Talk to your friends and family about your insecurities. It's easy for negativity and self-doubt to build when you can't vent to anyone. Let your loved ones know when you're feeling down so they can remind you of your strengths and reaffirm how many people care about you. Take time for yourself. Make sure you have time to immerse yourself in the things you enjoy. Paint, practice music, read, or engage with whatever your hobbies are so you can keep yourself upbeat and interested.

However, it's best that you get to know him better if you don't already know him well enough to go out with him. If you answered no to most of these questions, perhaps you should reconsider your answer to him. You could decline or you could take the chance and go out with him, but remember to make sure you choose an answer that makes you happy and that you won't regret later. Don't be afraid to take your time when deciding. Entering a relationship with someone is a decision that should be taken seriously.
