      "content": "Use sharp hair-cutting shears. Dull scissors can damage your hair, so don’t use a pair of kitchen or craft scissors to cut hair. Instead, get a pair of hair-cutting shears, which have a sharper blade that will slice through hair easily. Look for hair-cutting shears at a beauty supply store or online. You may also be able to find them in the haircare department of your local department stores. Inexpensive pairs start out as low as $10."

      "content": "Use a doll, wig, or mannequin head for practice. Try out your hair cutting skills on a fake head of hair before you give anyone a real haircut. Make your dolls, wigs, or mannequin heads last longer by giving your practice models trims and long haircuts at first. This way you can give them multiple haircuts so you get more practice. Dig out your old dolls or ask family members if they have any dolls you can use. You can also find dolls at a thrift store or dollar store, as well as online. If you don’t have any wigs, look for cheap wigs online, at a thrift store, or at a costume shop. You might also ask friends or relatives if they have old costume wigs they can donate to you. Purchase mannequin heads from a beauty supply store or online. Mannequin heads start as low as $15 to $20, but you can get higher quality models that cost more."

      "content": "Cut hair while it's dry so it’s easy to see how it’ll look when it’s finished. Your hairstylist may cut your hair while it’s damp, but it's best to cut hair dry if you're first starting out. Wet hair will shrink up when it dries, so it's easier to make mistakes when cutting damp hair. On the other hand, cutting dry hair allows you to check your progress as you cut. [1] X Research source It’s especially important to cut curly or textured hair while it’s dry so you can see the curl patterns."

      "content": "Make small cuts so you’re less likely to make mistakes. When you're cutting hair, it’s easy to accidentally cut off more than you intended. To prevent this, trim small amounts of hair at a time. Slowly trim the hair until you’re happy with the haircut. [2] X Research source Check the hair after each cut to see how it looks. If you make a mistake, it’ll be easier to correct it if you catch it right away."

      "title": "Start with small trims.",
      "content": "Start with small trims . It’s much easier to do a trim than to make a major change. When you first start cutting hair, just cut the split ends with the tip of your hair-cutting shears. Then, try trimming about .25 to .5 in (0.64 to 1.27 cm) from the hair. When you feel like you’re getting the hang of it, try cutting longer hairstyles. [4] X Research source Doing trims will also give you the opportunity to get more practice, since you won’t be removing much hair at once."

      "content": "Do a few bang trims to perfect your technique. Start by combing the hair forward from the top of the head. Hold the hair between your index and middle fingers, then slowly cut horizontally. Use the tips of your hair-cutting shears to snip the ends of your bangs to even them out and to soften the edges. In addition to blunt-cut bangs, you could try side-swept fringe or wispy bangs ."

      "content": "Practice giving a fade . With an 00000 blade on your trimmers, create a guideline from the temples around the back of the head where you want your fade to begin. Then, use an electric shaver to shave below the guideline. Next, open the lever on your trimmer and cut a second guideline about .5 in (1.3 cm) above your initial guideline. Switch to a 1-1/2 detachable blade and cut a new guideline about 1 in (2.5 cm) above the previous one. Hold your clipper over your comb to blend your top guideline into the hair. Use a 1A detachable guide followed by a 1/16 guard to blend the fade. [5] X Research source Work slowly so you don’t accidentally cut too much hair at once."

      "content": "Hone your layer-cutting skills . Section the top half of your hair into 3 sections and clip them, leaving the bottom of your hair loose. Let down the top section of your hair and comb it up above your head, then cut it to your desired length for the top layer. Working horizontally down the center section, comb the hair up to match your first cut, then trim that section to match the first. Keep working down to the bottom section, then repeat for each of the side sections. [6] X Research source Make all of your cuts above the head. This way you can use your first cut at the top of the head as a guide for all of your other cuts. As you move further down toward the nape of the neck, the layers will get longer since they’re further down on the head."

While cutting your own hair can be tricky, arranging a mirror in front of you and behind you to see all sides of your head can help. Stand in front of a large bathroom or dresser mirror. Then, place a smaller mirror in front of you so you can check the back and sides of your hair as you cut. [7] X Research source Try different mirror positions to find what works for you."

Tell them how long you’ve been cutting hair, how many haircuts you’ve done, and which skills you’ve practiced most. Then, let them decide if they feel comfortable letting you cut their hair.

Reassure your potential models that you’re going to do your best to create a style they love. However, make sure they’re okay with getting a different style than they expect. [10] X Research source Say, “I love the style you’ve picked out! I should be able to pull this off, but will you be upset if it looks a bit different than the picture?” If the person isn’t okay with a possible bad haircut, it may be best to turn them down as a practice model so you don’t risk disappointing them.
