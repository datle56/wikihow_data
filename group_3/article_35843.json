[7] X Research source Build empathy by listening to the other person and validating her perspective. If possible, you can get know her situation better by spending time with her in her environment — such as with her family, in her home, going to events that are important to her, learning her history, and so on. Maybe you have an easy time expressing your emotions and the other person is very closed off, for example. It might be hard for you to understand why she can't take emotional risks, until you get to know her better and realize that her family never says \"I love you\" or talks about their feelings; whereas in your family, open communication was encouraged."
