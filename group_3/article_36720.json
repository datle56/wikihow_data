      "content": "Select a thin piece of thread or dental floss for the job. Thin thread or dental floss will slide more easily underneath a stuck ring. The waxy surface of dental floss can make it even more useful in this situation. If you choose to use thread, make sure it’s thin but strong.

      "content": "Position 1 end of the thread at your middle knuckle above the ring. Use your free hand to place the end of the thread or floss at the knuckle on the fingertip side of your finger. Wind the string around your knuckle once to get the wrapping process started. If you’re working by yourself, you may need to briefly hold the string in place by squeezing the fingers on the affected hand tightly together."

      "title": "Wrap the thread around your finger from the knuckle to the ring's edge.",
      "content": "Wrap the thread around your finger from the knuckle to the ring's edge. The idea is to compress your skin close to the ring, so wind the thread tightly around your finger. Keep wrapping it around as you slowly move toward the ring. Make sure each wrap is directly next to the previous wrap. Stop wrapping once you reach the edge of the ring. You shouldn’t be able to see any flesh under or between the thread from your knuckle to the ring."

      "title": "Slip the end of the string under the ring and pull it up on the other side.",
      "content": "Slip the end of the string under the ring and pull it up on the other side. Now that your finger skin is compressed, you should be able to wedge the end of the thread under the ring and pass it through to the other side. Pull the thread up and toward your middle knuckle."

      "title": "Unwrap the thread from this position to slowly to remove the ring.",
      "content": "Unwrap the thread from this position to slowly to remove the ring. Pull the thread taut toward your knuckle and start unwinding the string. Each time you unwind 1 of the layers, the ring will move a little farther up the compressed skin of your finger. Keep unwinding the thread until you reach the starting point at your knuckle.

      "content": "Pull the loosened ring completely off your finger. After unwinding the thread, you should be able to pull the ring completely off your finger. If the ring is still stuck, you may want to try another removal technique or seek emergency assistance.

      "content": "Elevate and ice the affected finger for 5-10 minutes to reduce swelling. Lift up your hand so the blood drains out of the affected area. Then, hold an ice pack to the finger for 5-10 minutes to help reduce the swelling around the ring. After 10 minutes, relax your hand and try to pull off the ring with your free hand. Don’t try to force it! This could cause additional swelling. If the ring won’t come off at this point, try another technique."

      "content": "Cut the ring off your finger with a ring cutter. You can get a ring cutter from a jewelry store, fire department, or emergency room. It’s best to let a professional cut the ring off your finger so that you don’t injure yourself, and newer ring cutters are now available that can cut all ring metals, including Titanium and Tungsten Carbide rings (the Ring Rescue Dolphin Ring Cutter). Keep in mind that the ring will be damaged if you cut through it. [4] X Research source Ask a jeweler if the metal can be welded to repair the band once you get it off."

      "content": "Apply soapy water or olive oil and twist the ring as you pull it. Cover the skin around and underneath the ring with warm, soapy water or olive oil. Once the area is saturated, use your free hand to twist the ring clockwise and counterclockwise to loosen it up. Then, keep twisting as you gently try to pry the ring off. [5] X Research source You can use any oil you have on hand for this. For example, baby oil, vegetable oil, and jojoba oil are all good lubricants."
