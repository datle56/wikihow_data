If the disease is diagnosed in its early stages, the common treatment is with antibiotics. He will prescribe you antibiotics, which you will take for one to two weeks. Some strains of the bacteria that cause typhoid fever have become very resistant to some antibiotics. This means that your doctor will do thorough laboratory tests to come up with the best treatment plan for the particular strain you have. [2] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source The type of antibiotic you are prescribed will vary depending on where you contracted the strain and if you have had it before. The most common antibiotics prescribed include ciprofloxacin, ampicillin, amoxicillin or azithromycin. You may also be prescribed cefotaxime or ceftriaxone. These medications are typically prescribed for 10 to 14 days. [3] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source"

The oral vaccine is given through 4 doses spaced 2 days apart, so it would be given on days 0, 2, 4, and 6. The injected vaccine is given to children above two years old and adults. A booster is done every two years. The oral vaccine is given 24 to 72 hours after intake of any antibiotics by mouth on an empty stomach so that the vaccine will not be destroyed by the antibiotics. It is given to children above six years old and adults. You should get your vaccines completed at least one to two weeks before you travel, depending on which vaccine you get. The vaccine works on individuals that have had typhoid fever as well as those that have not. However, you should get re-vaccinated every 2-5 years.
