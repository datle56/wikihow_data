      "content": "Track your time. For one or two weeks, carry a notebook or daily planner with you, and write down everything you do. Make note of how much time you spend on work, homework, entertainment, and daily tasks like sleeping and eating. [1] X Research source Don’t try to change your habits yet. The purpose of this step is just to give you an idea of how you’re using your time right now. Be honest with yourself about how you spend your time – you can always improve your habits later. Make a point to clarify the purpose of certain tasks. For example, you may spend two hours on the internet on both Monday and Tuesday. However, Monday's time may be spent on Facebook and gaming sites, while Tuesday's time is spent learning more about the skills you need to reach your goals. Include this in your tracker so that you get a better picture of how you're using your time."

      "content": "Identify the time of day when you perform best. After you’ve tracked your activities for several days, look over your notes and see when you are most productive.

      "title": "Pay attention to where you’re losing time.",
      "content": "Pay attention to where you’re losing time. Look over your notes again and ask yourself if any consistent time-wasters appear. If an activity is unnecessary, doesn’t enrich your life, and doesn’t move you closer to your goals, it’s probably a time-waster. Think about how you can cut back on these activities or get rid of them completely.

      "content": "Be realistic. Keep your needs and limitations in mind as you plan your schedule. Just because something works on paper doesn’t necessarily mean you’ll be able to stick with it in real life. Ask yourself how you’ll keep your energy levels up throughout the day, and remember that you’ll need to leave small gaps in your schedule for things like eating and going to the bathroom.

      "content": "Get inspired. Search the internet for articles on how successful people structure their days. Notice how much time they devote to work, play, and rest. Consider borrowing parts of your schedule from somebody you admire. For example, you might be inspired by someone like Benjamin Franklin, who got up at five o’clock every morning to plan the day ahead."

      "content": "Use the 80-20 rule to work smart. The 80-20 rule states that 80 percent of results should come from 20 percent of your effort. To meet this goal, you may want to focus on what provides you with the best results and consider delegating or eliminating those tasks that seem \"less urgent\" or unneeded. [9] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Family Physicians Organization devoted to improving the health of patients, families, and communities Go to source For example, you may decide to wash your dishes every other night in order to create time to complete a task needed to meet your goal. Ask yourself these questions: Is every task on my list urgent? Are the tasks on my list within my purview or do they belong elsewhere? Am I spending too much time on certain types of tasks? Are there tasks that I should delegate? Are all of these tasks really necessary to the overall outcome?"

      "content": "Make to-do lists. To-do lists help you keep track of all the tasks you have on your plate. It’s a good idea to have several lists: one for today, one for the week or month, and one for the whole year. This will help you maintain a big-picture view of your responsibilities without getting overwhelmed. [10] X Expert Source Leah Morris Life Coach Expert Interview. 19 June 2020. Be thoughtful about what you put on your to-do list. Only include tasks that matter to you and that you’re prepared to actually do. Group similar tasks together to maximize your to-do list. For example, consider combining your errands. Rather than running to the store for every little item, group errands together. Three to five items is a good length for a daily to-do list."

For many people, this window occurs a few hours after waking up. [12] X Trustworthy Source University of Georgia Cooperative Extension Division of the University of Georgia focused on research and community education Go to source Obligations like classes and meetings might prevent you from working during your most productive time of day.

      "content": "Focus on one thing at a time. Commit all your attention to one task before you move on to another. Multitasking might make you feel productive, but it actually makes you less efficient overall. If you tend to get sidetracked, look for ways to block out distractions. Close your door, put on noise-canceling headphones, or go somewhere without Wi-Fi to get your work done."

      "content": "Create routines. Identify the basic tasks you need to do over and over again, like cooking or getting your kids ready for school. Come up with some efficient methods for doing these tasks, and repeat these methods until they’re a daily habit. For instance, you might want to create a new morning routine or a weekend meal prep routine. When you can do simple tasks on autopilot, you free your mind to focus on more challenging things."

      "content": "Avoid over-committing. You want to accomplish as much as possible, but doing too much can quickly overwhelm you. Rather than helping you live better, over-committing leads to burnout. Before adding new items to your planner or to-do list, ask yourself if you really have time for them. Look over your schedule to make sure you have time. Ask yourself if the new addition is worth giving up something else."
