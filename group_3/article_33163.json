      "content": "Play with two people. Gin rummy is best played with only two players. But if you have a third person who wants to play, have one person act as the dealer without dealing themselves any cards. Then rotate this position around the table for each subsequent hand. [1] X Research source For four players, play two separate games. Or form teams, and after the two simultaneous games, add up your and your teammate's scores to see if together you beat your opponents' total."

      "content": "Use a 52-card deck. If your deck of cards came with any Jokers, place those to the side and don't use them. Note that aces will be low in this game (i.e. worth one point), and jacks, queens, and kings are high (each worth ten points). [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Deal ten cards to each player.",
      "content": "Deal ten cards to each player. The dealer should distribute ten cards, face-down on the table, to each player. Cards should always be dealt clockwise around the table, but with only two players, you'll just alternate back and forth until you both have ten cards."

      "content": "Start the stock pile and the discard pile. The remaining cards left after dealing should be placed in a pile face-down on the table. This is the stock pile, and from the top of it the dealer should draw one card and place it face-up next to the stock pile. The face-up card forms the beginning of the discard pile."

      "content": "Sort your cards into melds. Look at the ten cards in your hand. Sort them into any possible “melds,” which are sets or runs. A set is three or four cards of the same rank (5-5-5), and a run is three or more cards of consecutive rank in the same suit (4-5-6). [4] X Research source An example of a set is 10 of diamonds, 10 of spades, and 10 of clubs. An example of a run is jack of diamonds, queen of diamonds, and king of diamonds. Since aces are low, they can't be in a run with a king. You can have ace-2-3, but not queen-king-ace."

If you weren't the dealer, you get to decide if you want to pick up the face-up card in the discard pile, or if you want to pass on it because it's not a helpful card for you. If you pass, the dealer can choose to pick it up. [5] X Research source If you both decline it, the non-dealer picks up the card from the top of the stock pile."

Look to see if you already have a couple of cards with the same numerical value, or if it suddenly connects a couple cards to form a run.

If a card seems like an outlier that won't match easily with your other cards, then it might be worth discarding. You can also discard whatever you just picked up from the stock pile. You can't discard a card you just picked up from the discard pile in that turn. You can discard it during your next turn if you want, but you must keep it for at least one turn.

At each turn, decide if you want the card that your opponent just placed face-up in the discard pile, or if you want to take the mystery card from the top of the stock pile. As you form melds, do not place them on the table. You don't want your opponent to see your progress."

If you reach a point when all of your cards are part of a meld and none of them are unmatched (these cards are called “deadwood”), then you've reached “gin.” Draw a card once it's your turn and place it face-down on the discard pile to signify that you're knocking. Reaching gin earns you 25 bonus points in addition to all your opponent's deadwood points.

Add up each player's deadwood points and subtract to find the difference. Write down each player's points on a piece of paper. [15] X Research source For example, after laying off, your opponent might have two Queens left, which totals 20 points. If you have two 2's, that's 4 points. The difference between the two is 16 points. If you reached gin, there's no subtraction needed. All of your opponent's deadwood points become yours (plus the 25-point bonus)."

The difference between the deadwood points is awarded to them rather than you in this case, along with a 25-point undercut bonus. [16] X Research source For example, if you knock and have 9 points of deadwood, and your opponent lays off their cards and ends up with 2 points of deadwood, then they've undercut you.
