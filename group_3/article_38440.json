The crust will be flaking, falling and turning to white ash. After allowing the cookware to cool a bit (to avoid cracking the cast iron), use the following steps.

[3] X Research source If you have purchased your cast iron cookware as new, then it will be coated in wax or an oily coating to prevent rust. This will need to be removed before seasoning so this step is essential. Soak in hot, soapy water for five minutes, then wash off the soap and air dry."

Heat for at least an hour to bake on a \"seasoning\" cover that will continue to protect the pan from rust and provide a stick-resistant surface. Place a sheet of aluminum foil or a large disposable foil roaster under the pan, on a lower rack or on the bottom of the oven, to catch drippings. Let cool to room temperature in the oven."

      "content": "Maintain the cast iron with ongoing care. Every time you wash your cast iron cookware, season it without fail. Place the cast iron cookware on the stove and pour in about a 3/4 teaspoon of corn oil (or other cooking fat). Wad up a paper towel and spread the oil across the cooking surface, any bare iron surfaces, and the bottom of the cookware. Turn on the burner and heat until smoke starts to appear. If using an electric stove, heat slowly as hot spots can crack the cast iron. Cover the cookware and turn heat off. Leave until cooled before placing in storage. Wipe off any excess fat before storing. If your cast iron gets sticky from using oil instead of bacon fat, use it over a campfire to make some bacon or other item which renders pig fat, and the stickiness will burn off."

It will come out looking like the day it came out of the mold. [5] X Research source Allow it to cool overnight. Wash the residue off with water only in the sink, using a stiff abrasive pad. Dry the cast iron utensil off with a paper towel, and immediately place the cookware back in the oven at 350ºF/180ºC for 10 minutes or so. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Take the utensil out of the oven after the 10 minute drying time is complete. Lightly brush the utensil with a paper towel coated with Crisco (or other solid cooking oil). Liquid vegetable oil will do in a pinch, but it's better to save the liquids until after the initial seasoning. [7] X Research source It is important in this step only to lightly coat the cast iron with a thin coating of oil, just enough until it barely glistens. Do not allow any puddles or pools of liquid as this will cause problems at a later time."

This allows for any excess oil to drain off to the sides, and prevents pooling during the seasoning process. [8] X Research source The higher heating temperatures allow for the oil to truly \"cook\" as opposed to just \"gumming up\" at lower temperatures. Cook undisturbed for 1 hour. Note: During this step, it will be best to turn off any smoke alarms in the immediate area as the cookware may smoke quite a lot. Ceiling fans also aid in ventilation."
