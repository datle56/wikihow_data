      "content": "Turn the key to the “Unlock” position if your safe has a dual lock feature. Some electronic safes have a second lock that keeps the safe sealed even when the combination code is entered correctly. If your safe has a keyhole, insert the key completely and rotate it clockwise to the “Unlock” position. Once you turn the key, pull it out of your safe. [1] X Research source Keep your keys in a safe place, such as a cupboard or dresser drawer, so you don’t misplace it."

      "content": "Look for the combination on the safe’s manual. Check the back of the owner’s manual for a small card that has your safe’s information printed on it. Find the 5-digit number that’s labeled as the “Factory Code” so you know the combination to unlock your safe. Write down the combination or commit it to memory so you’re able to open the safe later on. [2] X Research source The card on the back of the manual is usually removable so you can save it. Do not throw the card away since it has important information about the serial and model number, which you may need in the future if you forget your passcode."

If you accidentally type the wrong number, wait a few seconds so the safe resets before starting the code from the beginning again. Once you enter the correct code, then the light above the keypad will turn green. [3] X Research source If you enter the incorrect passcode too many times, then the safe may time out and not allow you to unlock it for a set amount of time. If the keypad or light doesn’t work when you’re entering your code, then you may need to replace the batteries in the side of the keypad."

When you enter the code and the light turns green, grab the handle next to the keypad and rotate it downward so the bolts come undone. If you don’t open the door within 4 seconds, then the lock will engage again and you’ll have to retype the code.

Find the set of 3 numbers separated by hyphens on the bottom of the card to use as your combination. Memorize the combination or remove the card so you can still get into the safe if you forget. [5] X Research source For example, your combination may look like 53-17-24. Keep the safe’s information in a spot where you won’t forget it so you can access it later on."
