First, shuffle the 4 Kings and set them in a face-down pile. Then, shuffle the Queens and set them on top of the Kings. Finally, mix up the 4 Jacks and place them on top of the stack. Place the Castle deck in the middle of the table for everyone to see. [1] X Research source There are Red and Teal versions of Regicide, but the only differences are the colors of the card backs."

[5] X Research source Yielding can be beneficial if you want to keep cards in your hand for a stronger enemy. Animal Companions (Aces): You may play an Animal Companion alone or pair it with any other card in your hand. An Animal Companion adds 1 to the strength of your attack and allows you to use multiple suit effects (explained in the next step). Combos: You may play multiple cards of the same value if the combined total is 10 or below. The total value of the cards becomes your attack strength, and you may use the effects for the suits that were played."

Diamonds: Starting with the current player, everyone draws 1 card at a time until a number of cards equal to the attack value have been drawn. You may only have as many cards in your hand as you did when you started the game. Clubs: Double the attack value, so an 8 of clubs has an attack value of 16. Spades: Reduce incoming damage from the current enemy by the value of all Spades that have been played. If you play a Jester on your turn, it doesn’t add to the attack value but it negates the enemy immunity until that enemy is defeated.
