It will be a lot easier to shave with a pregnant belly if you can ask your partner or someone else close to you to help you get those difficult-to-reach places. If you are not too shy or embarrassed, this intimate act of grooming can be a great bonding experience. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Get a handheld mirror to help you see what you are doing. Especially if you are shaving by yourself, you need a mirror to check all the angles. A handheld makeup mirror or a small mirror with suction cups are great choices. You can use a full-length mirror if you can find a comfortable way to position yourself in front of it."

      "content": "Place all the necessary supplies on the edge of the tub. When you are pregnant, it can be a challenge to get in and out of the tub, so make sure you have all your supplies at hand before you get in and begin shaving. Have the following within your reach: some mild soap, a gentle exfoliant, a clean washcloth, a new sharp razor, and moisturizing shave cream or lotion. [2] X Research source Using a new razor is important because old razors get dull over time, causing more cuts when you shave. You may also want to buy a razor extender if your belly bump makes it really hard to reach the areas you want to shave. All you have to do to use them is insert your razor into the extender and it acts like a long handle, allowing you to reach 6–10 inches (15–25 cm) further. Choose soaps and lotions that are free from dyes, scents, or other chemicals so you don't irritate your skin or inadvertently harm the baby. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Use a mild soap to cleanse your skin and soften the hairs. Washing just before shaving softens hairs and prevents infection by cleaning the skin of most bacteria that could enter your body in case of an accidental nick from your razor."

      "title": "Exfoliate your skin to remove dead skin cells and lift the hair.",
      "content": "Exfoliate your skin to remove dead skin cells and lift the hair. Put about 1 fl oz (30 ml) of exfoliating cream or lotion in the palm of your hand and rub both hands gently together to distribute the cream. Then, rub your hands all over your skin in gentle, small circles. After you've finished, rinse really well to get all the dead skin and the grit from the exfoliant off of your body. It’s really important to be gentle with your skin when you are pregnant, so avoid exfoliating with harsh abrasives. Great alternatives to harsh exfoliants are cooled, drained coffee grounds, a wet loofah, or an exfoliating mitt. [4] X Research source For exfoliating your extra-sensitive bikini zone, you can use a dry washcloth. The skin around your vagina is even more sensitive than usual because of increased blood flow and swelling, so be extra gentle. [5] X Research source Never use a microbead exfoliant. Microbeads are bits of plastic in beauty products that are gradually being banned around the world for their harmful effects on the environment. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Soak for at least 10 minutes in warm water. Soaking in the tub softens the hair and makes it easier to shave. Don't add any bubble bath, essential oils, or bath bombs, though because they can be unsafe for use when you are pregnant. [7] X Research source Be very careful getting in and out of the tub. Installing a handle on the tub’s wall can help you get in and out of the tub safely. It’s generally safe to take a bath when you are pregnant as long as the water does not raise your core body temperature and you have not yet lost your mucus plug. If you have any concerns or are unsure, ask your doctor. [8] X Research source"

      "title": "Lean back in the tub or sit comfortably on a shower seat.",
      "content": "Lean back in the tub or sit comfortably on a shower seat. In order to shave, you will need to be sitting at an angle that allows you to reach your legs and your bikini area. Leaning against the back of the tub is a great starting position because you can rotate to the left and right and lift your legs up on the edge to access all your hard-to-reach areas. Because your center of gravity shifts when you are pregnant, you can get dizzy easier when bending over, so it’s not a good idea to try to shave while standing. [9] X Research source"

      "title": "Lubricate the skin you want to shave with a shaving cream or lotion.",
      "content": "Lubricate the skin you want to shave with a shaving cream or lotion. Shaving dry puts you at a higher risk for cuts and scratches which could end up infected. Just before you shave, apply a generous amount of cream or lotion all over the area you want to shave. Avoid shampoo and bar soap because they can irritate the skin and clog the razor. Instead, use a cream or lotion that is made for shaving or, in a pinch, you can use your hair conditioner. [10] X Research source If the water washes the lotion away before you shave an area, be sure to reapply and don't try to shave the skin without the lubricant."

      "content": "Shave most hair in the opposite direction of hair growth. As long as your razor is clean and sharp and you have used a good lubricating cream or lotion, you can safely shave leg hair , armpit hair, and belly hair against the direction it grows. Use the mirror to see below your belly or have your partner shave areas that you can't see or reach. To shave your legs, start at your ankle and work your way up to your thigh. Run the razor against the hair in long, straight strokes. Rinse the blade after each stroke of the razor to clear the blades of the little hairs and lotion. Use the side of the tub as a leg rest to help you comfortably access the lower parts of your legs. If you are in your last trimester, it might be too hard to reach your ankles. In that case, ask your partner for help or use the razor extender."

      "content": "Shave pubic hair in the direction of hair growth. Using your hand mirror so you can see what you are doing, gently run the razor over hair growth in your bikini area in the same direction as it grows. The skin where your pubic hair grows is more sensitive than the skin on your legs and shaving against the hair growth can result in ingrown hairs, cuts, and infections. [11] X Research source Rinse the blade between each stroke to clear out hair and lotion. To access hard to reach hair, put your leg up on the side of the tub and shift your body to the left and right as needed."

      "content": "Rinse your body with clean water after you’ve finished shaving. Wash away all the little hairs and the cream so that you don’t get itchy or irritated after you’ve shaved. Rinsing off also lets you inspect your work and see if you missed any areas. It’s best to rinse with clean water from the showerhead instead of the tub water, because little floating hairs in the tub will stick to your skin."

Set up a work zone for shaving somewhere that is private, well-lit, and allows you to lean back in a comfortable position. You can lay a towel on the bed or the floor and stack pillows behind you for back support. [12] X Research source If you have a corded electric shaver, make sure your space is close to a power outlet or you have a long extension cord to keep it plugged in. Because you are shaving delicate and hard-to-reach places, you'll want an electric shaver with a small head and straight blades. Get a shaver that is no more than 2 inches (5.1 cm) across."

      "content": "Shave the hair by passing the razor over your skin in small strokes. You do not need to use a lotion or cream to shave with an electric shaver and because it has built-in guards, your chances of getting cuts or nicks are lower than with a razor. After every few passes over your skin, dust off the little hairs on the shaver head with the edge of the towel you are sitting on. [13] X Research source Most electric shavers are safe to use anywhere on your body. To prevent any accidental cuts, just make sure to pull the skin tight before passing the shaver over it. To prevent irritation, your skin needs to be clean and completely dry before using an electric shaver, so do not shave immediately after you've washed and/or exfoliated your skin. Sitting up in a yoga pose will help you access the hair on your inner thigh and in the creases of your legs."

To combat this, apply a thin layer of sensitive-skin anti-itch cream once or twice per day to relieve an annoying itch. Avoid lotions with added dyes and perfumes as they can further irritate the skin. [18] X Research source"
