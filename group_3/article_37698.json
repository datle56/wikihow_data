      "content": "Thaw the turkey in the fridge for 24 hours for every 5 pounds (2.3 kg). The USDA recommends this thawing method for cooking turkey because it’s safe and can be adjusted for any size bird. Be sure to allow for 24 hours of thawing for every 4 or 5 pounds (1.8 or 2.3 kg) of turkey.

Avoid keeping the turkey in the refrigerator for longer than 48 hours after it is completely thawed, as this can cause the meat to go bad."

      "content": "Place the bird in water for 30 min per 1 lb (0.45 kg) for same-day thawing. Keep the turkey in its original wrapper, and submerge it in a bath of cold water in the sink or a large bowl. For example, if you have a 16 pounds (7.3 kg) turkey, it will need to thaw for 8 hours before you can cook it!

      "content": "Microwave the turkey for 6 min per 1 lb (0.45 kg) for quick defrosting. Unwrap your turkey and place it on a microwave-safe dish. The specific instructions for defrosting will depend on the weight of the turkey and the wattage of your microwave. While the turkey is in the microwave, make sure it’s rotating, and flip it over several times while defrosting. Once the turkey is thawed, cook it immediately. [3] X Trustworthy Source FoodSafety.gov Online portal combining food safety information from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, the Food Safety and Inspection Service, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Go to source Normally, you can find the information for thawing a turkey in the manual of the microwave or by searching for the brand of the microwave and the phrase “thawing turkey” online. If your turkey starts to cook instead of thawing, take it out of the microwave and let it rest for about 5 minutes before continuing with the thawing process."

      "content": "Reach into the turkey to remove the giblets . If you bought your turkey from the store, there might be a package of innards or other organs inside of the turkey. Locate the cavities between the legs of the turkey and at the top of the turkey where the neck would be, and use your hand to grab and pull out everything that’s inside of the bird. You can set them aside for later. [4] X Research source Some people save the giblets for making a delicious giblet gravy to drizzle over the turkey. If you don’t want to eat these parts, you can discard them as soon as you remove them from the bird."

      "content": "Wipe the turkey with a dry paper towel to remove excess moisture. Sometimes, after thawing the turkey, it can appear wet. Grab a paper towel and blot the water off of the turkey before you season it to ensure that the seasoning sticks to the skin. [5] X Research source Any additional bacteria on the turkey will cook off during the roasting, so don’t worry about trying to get the bird completely clean. Avoid running water over the turkey or using a kitchen towel to clean it, as this can spread bacteria throughout your kitchen from drips or splashes of the contaminated water."

For an easy dry brine, combine 0.5 teaspoons (2.5 mL) of kosher salt per 1 pound (0.45 kg) of turkey with 1 tablespoon (15 mL) of black pepper and the zest of a lemon. Then, rub the salt mixture all over the bird and let sit for at least an hour. [6] X Research source You can allow the brine to sit on the turkey for up to 2 days before cooking, and you can apply the brine even when the turkey is thawing.

To make the stuffing, simply mix 4 cups (950 mL) of scored bread, 1 cup (240 mL) of chopped celery, and 1 chopped onion together, and use your hands to completely fill the cavity of the turkey by packing the mixture into it. [8] X Research source Be aware that stuffing will add extra cook time to the recipe. Add an extra 30 minutes to the cook time if your turkey is stuffed."

To truss the bird, secure the wings to the turkey by wrapping baker’s twine around the body of the turkey, then cross the twine under the bottom of the bird. Finally, tie the legs together. [9] X Research source You can also truss a stuffed bird to keep the stuffing from coming out of the cavity while the turkey is in the roaster."

[13] X Research source Covering the turkey with a fat, like oil or butter, makes the skin crispy but not burnt. If you like moist skin on your turkey, apply less oil or butter."

Set a timer when the turkey is in the oven to remind you to cover it with foil after the first 30 minutes pass.
