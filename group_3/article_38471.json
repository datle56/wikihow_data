When you buy a lock for your luggage, make sure what you buy fits the case, otherwise you won’t be able to close your suitcase properly. A thick shackle is better, as it will be harder to pick or cut off. If your lock opens with a key, remember to keep that key with you at all times, probably best with the rest of your valuables. [5] X Expert Source Amy Tan Travel Planner & Founder, Planet Hoppers Expert Interview. 12 March 2020. TSA-approved locks can be opened with particular keys held by TSA agents. Be warned, though, that those keys can be copied, and are not difficult to acquire online. In addition, many can be picked or broken relatively easily. You do not need to have a TSA-approved lock on your luggage, though if you don’t have one, TSA will break it if they feel they need to get into your bags. If you use multiple locks, consider mixing the type of lock you use. This will help protect against criminals who only have one way to get through a lock, and can discourage would be thieves. If your carry-on bag has a lock on it, be sure to use it when you board the plane. It can be a hassle to open again if you need something, but that way it is always locked if you should go to the bathroom or take a nap. [6] X Research source"

This will make it easier to find when you arrive, and let you know very quickly if your bag is missing. It will also make it less likely that someone will take your bag by mistake.
