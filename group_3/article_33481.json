This is one of the more difficult stages, so practicing it through trial and error will help you improve at solving the Cube. [3] X Research source It's important to solve each section of your white cross in this specific order: blue, orange, green, red. [4] X Research source Make sure that the edge piece colors correspond to both the top white center logo piece and the red and blue side and center pieces. If the pieces are in these positions, you know you're on the right track. [5] X Research source If you've made any mistakes, try reconfiguring the pieces until you get them into the correct alignment. [6] X Research source"

By making sure that you've solved the white cross on the top layer before you position the corners, you'll have an easier time positioning the proper pieces in the middle layer. The white cross should still be on the top face of the Cube. [7] X Research source Remember that each corner pieces will have one white side and sides with two other colors. If a corner piece is located on the bottom side or layer, then rotate it until the corner is directly below where you want it. From here, move the pieces until you get the corners into the correct position. [8] X Research source Follow the same steps to position the pieces until the corners align and the entire top side of your Cube is white. [9] X Research source"

[12] X Research source Position the pieces until they're in a vertical line by rotating the top side until the front color of the edge piece on the top side (without yellow) matches one of the side center pieces.

There are several different sized Rubik's Cube games. For example, the original Rubik's Cube is called “3x3.” This means that there are three layers to the Rubik's Cube- a top, a middle, and a final layer. [19] X Research source The other sizes range from 2x2 cubes (Two layers) to 5x5 cubes (Five layers). There are larger cubes with over 5, but these are called V-Cubes (V-Cube 6 and V-Cube 7, to name a few). [20] X Research source"
