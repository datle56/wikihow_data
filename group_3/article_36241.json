      "title": "Scoop up excess foundation with a butter knife or spoon.",
      "content": "Scoop up excess foundation with a butter knife or spoon. If you just spilled the foundation, use the edge of your knife or spoon to scrape as much off as you can so it doesn’t set into the fabric. Try to avoid rubbing the foundation in so the stain doesn’t get any bigger. [1] X Research source Alternatively, try scooping or blotting up the excess foundation with some paper towel."
    },
    {
      "title": "Work foam shaving cream into the stain.",
      "content": "Work foam shaving cream into the stain. Use a foam shaving cream rather than gel since it removes the makeup more effectively. Squeeze the shaving cream directly onto the stain and cover it completely. Let the shaving cream sit for about 5–10 minutes to work its magic before rubbing it into the fabric with your fingers. When you’re finished, rinse the shaving cream out with cool water. [2] X Research source If the tag on your garment says “dry clean only,” then avoid trying to pretreat the stain and have it dry-cleaned right away."

    {
      "title": "Add a few drops of rubbing alcohol to the shaving cream for stubborn stains.",
      "content": "Add a few drops of rubbing alcohol to the shaving cream for stubborn stains. If shaving cream doesn’t do the trick on its own, apply it again to the stain and sprinkle in 3–4 drops of rubbing alcohol. Rub the shaving cream and alcohol mixture into your clothing and let it sit for about 5 minutes. After that, rinse the fabric out with cold water. [3] X Research source Test the rubbing alcohol on an inconspicuous spot of your clothing first to ensure that it doesn’t damage the fabric."

      "title": "Pretreat residual stains with heavy-duty laundry detergent.",
      "content": "Pretreat residual stains with heavy-duty laundry detergent. Choose a liquid detergent labeled for treating stains so you have the best chance of getting the foundation out of your clothes. Wet the stain with cool water and rub the detergent into the fabric. Cover the entire stain with the detergent and leave it to soak in for 5–10 minutes. [4] X Research source If you only have powder laundry detergent, mix it with enough water to make a thick paste and apply it to the stain."

    {
      "title": "Wash the stained item as you normally would.",
      "content": "Wash the stained item as you normally would. If the garment is machine-washable, toss it into your washer using the standard cycle. If you have more delicate clothing that isn’t machine-safe, then wash it by hand instead. [5] X Research source Let your clothes air-dry rather than putting them in a dryer since the heat could make the stain set in further. If you still notice a foundation stain on your clothes, try retreating it with shaving cream and detergent again. If you still can’t get it out, then take the garment to a professional cleaner."

    {
      "title": "Remove excess foundation with a spoon.",
      "content": "Remove excess foundation with a spoon. If you just spilled foundation on your clothes, scrape the foundation off the fabric with the edge of your spoon. Try to lift up as much of the foundation as you can so it doesn’t set deeper into the fabric. [6] X Research source Avoid rubbing the foundation into the fabric since it will only make the stain larger and more difficult to remove."

      "title": "Blot the area with a clean, dry paper towel.",
      "content": "Blot the area with a clean, dry paper towel. Gently press the paper towel onto the treated area to soak up any foundation that soaked into the fabric. Lift the towel straight up without rubbing or wiping the stain so it doesn’t smear. If there are still stain marks, use a fresh piece of paper towel to blot at it again. [7] X Research source"

      "title": "Work water and liquid dish soap into the stain.",
      "content": "Work water and liquid dish soap into the stain. Wet the stain with cool water and squirt the dish detergent directly onto the fabric. Rub the dish soap in with your fingers to clean the stain and let it sit for 5–10 minutes. After that, either rinse the soap out or toss your clothes right into the washer. [8] X Research source Dish soap is made to help cut through grease and oil, so it can help break down and remove the foundation from your clothes."

      "content": "Pre-treat stubborn stains with liquid laundry detergent. Pour a coin-sized amount of liquid laundry detergent directly onto the foundation stain. Use your fingers or a clean cloth to work the detergent deeper into the stain, and let it sit for about 10 minutes before you wash it. [9] X Research source If you’re cleaning delicate clothing, check the label on the detergent to make sure it’s suitable for the fabric. Test the detergent in an inconspicuous spot if you’re worried about it causing any damage to your clothes."

      "title": "Wash the garment as you normally would.",
      "content": "Wash the garment as you normally would. Once you’ve treated the stain with detergent, toss your clothes in the washing machine and run a standard cycle. For delicate fabrics, take your time to gently hand-wash them to remove the stain. When you’re finished, hang the clothes up to air-dry. [10] X Research source If you still notice a stain on your clothes, try washing your clothes with dish soap or laundry detergent again until it lightens up."

      "title": "Blow away the excess powder.",
      "content": "Blow away the excess powder. Rather than brushing or rubbing the powder foundation into the fabric, blow away the excess powder with your mouth. If you have a larger spill, then use a blow-dryer on a low setting to get the foundation off your clothes. [11] X Research source For a small powder spill, a puff of air may be enough to remove the makeup without washing your clothes ."

      "content": "Try a vinegar and water solution for a stubborn stain. Combine equal parts distilled white vinegar and cool water in a bowl. Wet a sponge or washcloth in the solution and blot it onto the foundation stain on your clothes. Gently work the solution into the stain with your fingers and let it soak in for about 5–10 minutes. After that, just rinse the fabric out with cool water. [13] X Research source Vinegar can sometimes make fabric dyes bleed, so test the solution on an inconspicuous spot to ensure the colors don’t run."

For more delicate clothes, hand-wash the stains in your sink. After you thoroughly wash your clothes, hang them up so they can air-dry completely. [14] X Research source If you’re still not able to get the stains out or if your clothes are labeled “dry clean only,” then take them into a professional cleaner."
