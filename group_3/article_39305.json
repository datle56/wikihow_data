      "content": "Make a double boiler with a pot of water and a bowl. Fill up a large pot with water and set it on your broiler. Add a glass bowl on top, making sure the bowl balances on the edge of the pot. Turn your heat on high and wait for the water to boil before you start adding in your ingredients. Always use a glass bowl, not plastic or metal. Glass bowls are safe to heat up, and they won’t leech anything into your shaving cream. This DIY recipe hasn’t been verified by dermatologists, so use caution if you plan to make it. If you have sensitive skin, test the shaving cream on a small patch of skin before using it to ensure it doesn’t cause any irritation."

      "content": "Shave in the direction that the hair grows. Hold your skin taut with one hand and grab your razor in the other. Take a look at your pubic hair and notice which direction the hair grows (usually, it grows pointing downward toward your feet). Use short strokes to remove the pubic hair , going in the same direction of your hair. Shaving with the grain of your hair reduces irritation and the chance of ingrown hairs. It might not give you quite as close of a shave, but your skin will be much smoother and less bumpy afterward. Always use a new, sharp razor when shaving your bikini line. Experts recommend changing your razor every 5 to 7 shaves, or more if you have sensitive skin.
