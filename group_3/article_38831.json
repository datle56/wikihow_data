If you never service your air conditioner, it can start pumping out harmful microorganisms as bacteria and grime build up inside of the components. The system won’t work as well either, which can cause your energy bills to skyrocket. A yearly service will keep these issues in check. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "It can range from $50-140 depending on the system. A simple window unit checkup will probably run closer to $50, while a service call for a large central air system will cost a little bit more. Call around to get quotes from HVAC companies in your area to find the best prices. Just make sure you’re hiring a licensed HVAC technician—your Uncle Joe from down the street won’t cut it here. [2] X Research source This may sound pricey, but you’ll pay even more over time if you never get your AC system serviced. A dirty or damaged AC unit can lead to some expensive utility bills!"

A typical service call will also involve a refrigerant check to make sure that your AC system is adequately filled. They’ll also assess the blower components to make sure the air is blowing out efficiently, and check your unit for any kinds of leaks or corrosion. They should be able to fix those problems for you on the spot.

      "content": "Replace the filter every 1-3 months depending on how often it’s running. If your AC system is acting up, replacing the filter may solve the issue. A dirty filter can lead to a variety of problems, and if replacing the filter fixes whatever issue you have, you probably don’t need to call a pro. Even if the AC is running just fine, make sure you replace it regularly to keep it running efficiently. [6] X Research source In central air systems, the filters are typically located in the return ducts on walls or ceilings. Room and window units usually have a filter behind the grill on the front of the unit. Split systems usually have a reusable filter in a panel on the compressor. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Turn the AC on and check the temperatures and refrigerant lines. Find the refrigerant line on your compressor. This is usually the largest pipe on a central air or split compressor. If there’s a bit of condensation on this pipe when the AC is running, it’s healthy. You can also take a thermometer and set it inside one of your ducts where the air is blowing out. Let the AC run for a while, and cross-reference the thermostat with the thermometer. If the numbers are relatively close, it’s functioning correctly. [13] X Research source You can either set the thermostat on a vent, or do a more precise check by testing the return and supply ducts near your central air unit. For window units, you should be able to tell if it’s working or not just by looking at it. If there isn’t any ice building up on the coils and it’s blowing cold air when you turn it on, it’s working just fine."

If your AC system shuts down randomly and you’re suspecting a compressor problem, flip the circuit breakers, wait 5 minutes, and try flipping them back on to see if that helps. If it doesn’t, follow your AC unit’s instruction manual to find the high-pressure limit switch, which is usually located on the compressor’s access panel. Flip that to see if your problem goes away.
