      "content": "Know the signs of a rootkit. Rootkits are hard to detect on Windows as they often disguise themselves as drivers or as critical files. Some signs that you may have a rootkit include: Your device is running slow, but your antivirus software is not detecting anything. You are unable to copy or find files you know exist on your machine (this is commonly used as DRM to prevent the copying or redistribution of music, movies, or video games). Your device obviously has malware on it, but your antivirus software does not detect anything. Your device takes a long time to start up. Your hardware has stopped working correctly. Other devices (like your router) are reporting that your device is using it even if you are not actively using them."
