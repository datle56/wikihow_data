      "title": "Underline key words and phrases.",
      "content": "Underline key words and phrases. Before you read aloud, go through the text (if possible) and mark any key words or phrases. You’ll want to emphasize these important spots so your audience can better understand your message. Some of the ways you can emphasize these words or phrases are to speak them slower, faster, softer, or louder. For example, if you’re reading the word “Boom!” you should increase your volume when you speak this word. However, the words “Shh, listen,” may require you to say them in a soft voice for emphasis. If the text contains any dialogue, mark that as well. Consider using different voices to give personality to each character. Don’t rely on being able to remember where you should vary the pace or volume in your reading. Make notes in your text that tell you when to do so and what type of emphasis to use."

      "title": "Decide where to breathe.",
      "content": "Decide where to breathe. Figuring out where you should breathe is important in keeping continuity in your reading. You’ll want to make sure you aren’t constantly running out of breath in the middle of a sentence. Before reading your selection to the audience, go through your text and mark where the breaks in the phrases and sentences are. These places are where you should breathe. When you do take a breath, take one deep enough to allow you to continue reading comfortably until the next marked break."
    },
    {
      "title": "Plan where you will pause.",
      "content": "Plan where you will pause. Pauses in the text provide emphasis and create a dramatic effect. They also give your listeners a chance to digest what you’ve just read and let your words sink in. Mark the places you will pause in your text to help yourself remember where to do this. Be sure you indicate which marks are for breaths and which are for pauses. Your pauses will be longer than simply taking a breath. Pauses can also give you an opportunity to scan your audience and make sure they are engaged. You can adjust your volume or emphasis based on audience reactions, if necessary."

      "title": "Watch others reading out loud.",
      "content": "Watch others reading out loud. It can help to watch others read aloud as an example of what to do. [1] X Research source As you’re watching them, note the things they do that make you take interest or that make it easier for you to understand the text. Keep a notepad handy so you can jot down notes while they are speaking. Look for videos of engaging speakers online. A quick Internet search should come up with some good examples, like Martin Luther King Jr. or Apple CEO Steve Jobs. Study what they do and try to mimic it in your own speaking."
    },
    {
      "title": "Do a read-through by yourself.",
      "content": "Do a read-through by yourself. Once you’ve planned out how you want to read your text, practice reading it out loud. This will give you a chance to become more comfortable with the text. Being familiar with the text will make your presentation smoother and allow you to focus on doing the things that will help you connect with and engage your audience. You may find it helpful to practice reading in front of a mirror. Practice the kinds of facial expressions and body language you would like to use during your reading, as these can help you connect with the text and your audience. Make sure you’re practicing emphasizing the words and phrases you’ve marked, breathing at the appropriate times, and adding in any dramatic pauses you’ve identified."

    {
      "title": "Record yourself so you can observe your reading.",
      "content": "Record yourself so you can observe your reading. Do a practice run of your reading and record it on your phone or a camera. Read the text as you would in front of an audience, using appropriate pauses, breathing, and emphasis. When you’re done, play the recording back so you can watch and listen to yourself. Make note of any strengths and weaknesses you identify in the playback, so that you can keep the things that work and improve those that don’t. Pay attention to your body language as well as your voice. You may notice quirks that you need to be aware of during your reading, such as bad posture or playing with your hair."

    {
      "title": "Practice your reading in front of others.",
      "content": "Practice your reading in front of others. Before going in front of your main audience, practice reading the text in front of a few friends or family members. In addition to providing an opportunity to rehearse, this will help ease any nervousness you might feel about reading aloud in front of others. Ask your test audience for feedback. They may be able to let you know if you need to speak more loudly or clearly. You can also ask if they were able to identify the key points of the text based on your use of emphasis."

    {
      "title": "Pace yourself.",
      "content": "Pace yourself. When reading aloud, the speed at which you read can significantly affect your listeners’ understanding and attention. Choose a pace that is not too fast or too slow. [2] X Research source Read slowly enough that your listeners are able to understand everything you’re saying and have enough time to process the information. However, you also want to keep the story moving so that listeners will not become bored. Nerves can cause you to speak faster than usual, even though it might not feel like you are. When you’re in front of an audience, make an effort to slow down your speech a little, even if it feels a bit unnatural to you. Chances are you’re talking faster than you think. When setting the pace, it is better to speak slower than faster. The audience will likely still pay attention if things are moving a little slow, but you may lose them completely by talking too fast.

      "title": "Practice pronunciation.",
      "content": "Practice pronunciation. Mumbling or mispronouncing words can make it difficult for your audience to understand what you’re saying. To improve your pronunciation, practice articulating certain sounds more emphatically through exercises. One thing you can do is highlight each word that ends in the letters t, d, p, b, k, or g, and practice over-pronouncing them. Doing so will help you pronounce your words more clearly in your regular speech. [4] X Research source Performing daily tongue twisters can also help you articulate your words more clearly. Some tongue twisters you can use are “red-leather, yellow-leather” and “eleven benevolent elephants.” If there are words you constantly mispronounce, take some extra time learning how to properly say these words and practice until you get it right."

      "title": "Warm up before you speak.",
      "content": "Warm up before you speak. On the day you will be speaking, keep your voice warmed and ready by singing or humming throughout the day. This will help ensure your voice is ready when you go to speak so you don’t sound strained. You can also repeat tongue twisters throughout the day to relax your tongue and lips. Repeat the phrase “You see Oz” in an exaggerated manner to stretch your jaw and bring more flexibility to your tongue. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Drink water and avoid caffeine and fatty foods.",
      "content": "Drink water and avoid caffeine and fatty foods. What you eat and drink can affect how your voice sounds. Make sure you are drinking plenty of water, including a cup before and after you drink any caffeinated beverages. It is best to avoid caffeinated beverages altogether, if possible. Mints, nuts, and fatty foods can cause heartburn or hoarseness in your voice, so avoid these when possible. [6] X Research source If you can, bring some water with you when you go up to read. If you find yourself getting hoarse, stop and take a sip."

      "title": "Make eye contact.",
      "content": "Make eye contact. Making eye contact with your audience can be tricky when you also have to read the words on a page. Doing so, however, will help you connect with your audience and engage them in what you are saying. When you’re reading aloud, look at the page only briefly if you can, scanning ahead in the text. Then, raise your head and make eye contact with your listeners, repeating the words you’ve just scanned. Keep a finger on the last sentence you read to help you keep your place in the text. Make sure you sweep the audience when you make eye contact. Look at people in the front, middle, back, and each side of the room. If you have trouble remembering to do this, try making notes in your text to help remind you. Also, make eye contact with specific people. Whichever direction you’re looking, lock eyes with one person while you deliver an entire sentence. This tactic can help you make a deeper connection with your audience. [7] X Research source"

      "title": "Animate your voice.",
      "content": "Animate your voice. Listening to someone read in monotone is not only boring, but it may make it harder for your listeners to follow along and understand the main ideas of your story. When you’re reading aloud, use inflection, which is where you stress certain words or phrases, and change the pitch, tone, and volume of your voice for effect. For example, when reading a story, speak in a higher tone during a really exciting part, and a lower tone of voice during parts that are more pensive or sad. If you’re reading a story with several characters, give them each a different voice. This can be difficult, so decide what each character should sound like and practice their voices ahead of time.

    {
      "title": "Use appropriate facial expressions.",
      "content": "Use appropriate facial expressions. While you’re reading, remember to use facial expressions that support the text. You can use facial expressions to show shock, happiness, disappointment, concern, anger, relief, and a myriad of other emotions. For example, smiling will let your audience know you believe in what you’re reading. In turn, your audience will be more invested. [9] X Research source If you’re reading a passage where there is a surprising or startling event, show that surprise on your face by widening your eyes and opening your mouth."
    },
    {
      "title": "Use body language.",
      "content": "Use body language. In addition to using body language to convey confidence in your message, like maintaining eye contact and smiling, you can also use body language to help convey the message you are trying to get across from your reading. Move your head, arms, and body in ways that reinforce your point. Make sure any body language you use if purposeful and deliberate. [10] X Research source . An example could be nodding your head up and down while you read a section of text you want the audience to agree with. Avoid body language that doesn’t add to your reading. For example, involuntarily moving your hands while you read with no purpose behind it can be distracting to your audience."

    {
      "title": "Breathe",
      "content": "Breathe . Doing a simple breathing exercise before you have to read aloud can help calm any nerves you have. Learning to control your breathing can help decrease your heart rate and blood pressure, and put your body in a relaxed, calm state. Try this breathing exercise to calm your nerves: Sit still with good posture somewhere comfortable. Close your eyes and start breathing in and out through your nose. Inhale for 1 count, hold the breath in for 1 count, and then exhale, counting to 4. Wait 1 count before inhaling again. Set a timer for 5 minutes and practice this breathing pattern the whole time. You should notice a difference in your mood when you are done. [11] X Research source"

      "title": "Strike a confident pose.",
      "content": "Strike a confident pose. An open, powerful pose can help you both look and feel more confident. [12] X Research source Keep your shoulders and hips squared, and sit or stand tall. Keep your feet planted firmly about 1 foot (30 cm) apart. Use a power stance both before and during your presentation to reduce nervousness and help you connect with the audience. If you have a podium or table in front of you that you can set your text on, rest your hands on it and lean forward slightly as you read. This can help you appear (and feel) more authoritative."

    {
      "title": "Focus on the people that are engaged.",
      "content": "Focus on the people that are engaged. No matter the topic, you’ll likely have a few people in the audience who don’t agree with what you are saying, are bored, distracted, or maybe even asleep. Ignore these people. Instead, focus your attention on the people who are engaged with your reading. Focusing your attention on these people will help you feel more relaxed and confident. Look for people who are nodding their heads “yes,” sitting up straight, and making eye contact with you. [13] X Research source"

      "title": "Turn nervousness into excitement.",
      "content": "Turn nervousness into excitement. It’s normal to feel nervous when you have to do something in front of a group of people. You may feel signs of nervousness, like clammy hands, sweating, shaking, or butterflies in your stomach. When you start to feel nervous, however, try telling yourself, “You’re not nervous, you’re excited!” Convincing yourself you’re excited (which can exhibit many of the same symptoms as nervousness) can help you relax and feel more confident.

      "title": "Don’t expect perfection.",
      "content": "Don’t expect perfection. Despite the saying “Practice makes perfect,” accepting ahead of time that you are going to make mistakes can help you deal with any nerves you’re experiencing. No matter how much you practice, there’s a good chance you’ll fumble over a word or 2 somewhere during your reading. Public speaking is a common fear, so many of the people in the room will be understanding of any mistakes you make. If you do make a mistake, just keep going. For example, if you say the wrong word or skip a line of text, there’s a good chance your audience didn’t even notice. Unless the mistake will hinder your audience’s understanding, keep moving as if nothing happened. [15] X Research source"
