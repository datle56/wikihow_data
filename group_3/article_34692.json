      "content": "Set up in a good location. When you give your dog a cut it can be quite a messy project. To keep the mess at a minimum, pick a spot in your home or yard that can be easily swept or vacuumed. You also need a surface to place your dog on, so that you can cut its fur comfortably. This surface should also be something that can be cleaned easily. If you want to contain all the fur you are going to be cutting off your dog, try putting a plastic sheet down under the grooming area. This will allow you clean up the fur more easily and thoroughly."

      "content": "Brush and bathe your dog. Before trimming your Shih Tzu, it’s a good idea to brush out any tangles that are in its coat, otherwise they might snag the clippers. Also, give your dog a bath and make sure its fur it completely dry before you start trimming it. [1] X Research source Wetting your dog’s coat can cause tangles to knot together worse than when dry. For this reason, it’s typically best to brush your dog before bathing it and not after. Some groomers prefer to do preliminary cutting before a bath to get rid of excess fur that would otherwise take a long time to dry. Then, after the preliminary cut and wash, they finish the fine tuning cuts. If you want to eliminate all stray hairs you have cut off the dog, you may need to bathe the pup twice. Bathe it once before the cut and once afterwords."

      "content": "Pick a blade length. Dog grooming clippers typically come with a variety of guards that you can put on them. These protect the dog’s skin from contact with the clippers. However, they also set the length that the fur will be trimmed to. Many groomers suggest using a #5 blade number for short summer cuts. However, if you want the fur a little longer, use a #3 or #4."

      "title": "Hold the dog in place, if necessary.",
      "content": "Hold the dog in place, if necessary. You may need to restrain the dog gently if it doesn’t like to have its fur cut. Keep its collar on and attach a leash so that you have some control over the dog. It's also a good idea to get someone to help you hold the dog, so that you can focus on cutting the dog's fur. Dogs that are used to being groomed may not need to be held in place. It all depends on your dog's comfort level with you and the grooming tools."

      "title": "Begin clipping the coat.",
      "content": "Begin clipping the coat. To start cutting your Shih Tzu’s fur, you should do a rough cut that gets that majority of the length of the fur off. Start in any area that you like and work methodically around the dog's entire body. Typically for a puppy cut, you want the fur down to one to two inches (2.5 to 5cm) long. Avoid cutting the fur on the head, tail, and ears at this point. They need more detailed and focused trimming to avoid nicking the dog's skin."

      "title": "Stop clipping if you notice clipper burn.",
      "content": "Stop clipping if you notice clipper burn. If you see a patch of your dog's skin reddening, stop clipping there. Clipping too close to the skin or too much in one area can inflame the skin, which will be uncomfortable for your dog. To avoid clipper burn, clip slowly, and make sure your clippers are sharp . [2] X Research source If your dog does get clipper burn, take care of the area. Apply a soothing ointment or spray that is made specifically for calming clipper burn on dogs. You may not notice right away if you have caused clipper burn on your dog. Make sure to look over the dog's body when you are done grooming to identify spots that may need a little care."

      "title": "Use a longer blade on the dog’s head.",
      "content": "Use a longer blade on the dog’s head. If you have used a #5 blade on the main part of the dog’s body, then consider using a #3 blade on its head. This will give you the cute puppy look of the puppy cut. It will also help protect the sensitive areas of the head. If the cut this blade gives looks too long, you can always go back over the area later with a shorter blade. However, if you cut it too short the first time, there is no going back."

      "title": "Be careful in sensitive areas.",
      "content": "Be careful in sensitive areas. There are some areas of the dog’s body where the skin of the dog could accidentally get clipped by the clippers. There are other parts that the dog may be resistant to having clipped. These typically include the dog’s anus and its groin. It’s important to take your time when clipping these areas so that you avoid injuring your dog."

      "title": "Do detailed work on the ears, paws, and tail.",
      "content": "Do detailed work on the ears, paws, and tail. Once most of the dog’s coat is clipped, you can go back in and do detail work on the rest of the fur. While the majority of the dog's body has smooth lines that can be cut in large swaths with the clippers, there are some areas where you need to take more time and care. Use scissors to trim the dog’s ears, paws, and tail, so that you can really smooth out those areas without nicking the dog's skin. For a puppy cut, you can decide whether you want to keep the dog’s ear fur long or whether you want it cut short. This is up to your personal preference. It can be very delicate work to cut the fur on your dog’s paws. You want to trim excess fur from between its toes but you have to be careful not to cut the skin accidentally."

      "title": "Go over the dog’s coat again.",
      "content": "Go over the dog’s coat again. Once you have roughed in the dog’s coat and you have trimmed its tail, ears, and paws, then you should go back and do even more detail work. Use your clippers once again and smooth out any rough areas. Use your comb or brush to inspect the dog's coat. If you find any uneven areas, take the time to trim them so the dog's cut is consistent and smooth. This is the time to get really picky. Inspect the coat closely and make sure that all areas of fur are the same length. Your attention to detail at this point will allow you to catch areas that were missed on your first pass over."
