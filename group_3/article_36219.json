      "content": "Put lemon juice on your brows. In the morning, squeeze a little lemon juice onto a cotton pad and wipe it onto your brows. Be careful not to get the lemon juice into your eyes! Let the lemon juice stay on your eyebrows until you cleanse your face that night. Spend some time outside while the lemon juice is on your brows, as the sun will increase the lightening effect."

      "content": "Swipe your brows with a facial toner. Pick up a facial toner, like witch hazel, from your supermarket or beauty shop. Squirt a little bit of the toner on a cotton pad, then gently wipe your brows with the cotton pad to lighten the tint. You can repeat this process as many times as is necessary, but keep in mind that if your toner contains alcohol, it may dry out your skin. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Scrub your brows with a clarifying shampoo.",
      "content": "Scrub your brows with a clarifying shampoo. A clarifying shampoo is designed to strip residue from your hair, so you can use it to strip color from your brows. Be very careful not to get the shampoo in your eyes, though! Use an eyebrow brush or a new toothbrush to brush a clarifying shampoo onto your eyebrows. After 60 seconds, wipe it off, then wash your face as usual to remove any residue."

      "title": "Try brow gel to lighten their appearance.",
      "content": "Try brow gel to lighten their appearance. Choose a colored brow gel at least one shade lighter than the tint. Use an eyebrow brush to lightly sweep the gel over your eyebrows. Make sure you comb through the entire brow so they get an even coloring. Allow the gel to dry, then repeat if you’d like to further lighten the appearance of your brows."

      "title": "Use facial bleach as a last resort.",
      "content": "Use facial bleach as a last resort. It’s best to have an expert do this for you, rather than trying it yourself. Go to a beauty or hair salon and ask a stylist to apply facial bleach, which is first-aid-strength hydrogen peroxide, to your brows in order to lighten them. Your stylist will likely put a few drops of the bleach on a cotton pad, then lightly wipe your eyebrows with the pad to remove the tint. Make sure the bleach does not come in contact with your eyes."

      "title": "Use makeup remover on your face.",
      "content": "Use makeup remover on your face. Sometimes, your eyebrows may look too dark because the dye has soaked into your skin, instead of just your eyebrow hairs. Choose a silicone- or oil-based makeup remover to remove the color from your skin. Dip a cotton ball in the remover, then gently wipe it over your eyebrows. You may be able to see the color transferring from your skin to the cotton ball. Take care not to get the makeup remover in your eyes."

      "title": "Try a tint remover on your hands.",
      "content": "Try a tint remover on your hands. Some eyebrow tinting kits come with tint remover in case you get the color on your hands. Read the directions carefully, as this product is usually not intended to be used on your eyebrows or face. Soak a cotton pad in the tint remover, then use it to scrub the stained area. Wash the area with soap and warm water once the color is gone to get rid of any residue from the tint remover."

      "title": "Scrub the stained skin with toothpaste.",
      "content": "Scrub the stained skin with toothpaste. If you got eyebrow tint on your skin, it may come off with toothpaste. Squeeze a small amount of non-gel toothpaste on a new toothbrush. Scrub the stained area with the toothbrush to remove the color. Repeat, if necessary. Then, rinse off the paste and wash the area with warm soap and water."

      "title": "Try an exfoliator on your face or body.",
      "content": "Try an exfoliator on your face or body. Exfoliators, like lava soap or face or body scrub, will help remove the tint from your skin. Wet your skin, then add a small amount of the lava soap or exfoliator to the area. Scrub your stained skin, rinse, and repeat until the color comes off. If you’re using this method on your face, make sure to use an exfoliator designed for facial skin and ensure the product doesn’t get in your eyes."

Dip a cotton ball in nail polish remover or isopropyl alcohol. Gently rub the cotton ball over your skin where the color has stained it. You may need to repeat this process several times to remove all the dye. Wash the area with warm water and soap after using nail polish remover or alcohol."
