      "content": "Wipe down your door with diluted household cleaner and a sponge. Pour 1–2 c (240–470 mL) of household cleaner into a small bucket, and fill it the rest of the way with warm water. Household cleaners are cleaning products designed for general hygiene purposes. Dip your sponge into the bucket, and wipe down your door. Rub your sponge in circular motions to pick up extra grime. [1] X Research source Dip your sponge into your bucket as you go, so you use fresh cleaner each time. Do this for both wooden and metal doors. You can use the same household cleaner for either."

      "content": "Repair any existing holes if you are painting a wooden door. Use a spackling compound and a putty knife to fill holes and dents less than 1 ⁄ 8 in (0.32 cm) deep, or use a 2-part filler or epoxy wood filler for deeper holes. Follow the particular instructions outlined on your spackling compound or wood filler. [2] X Research source In general, you should apply the compound or filler directly to the hole from the container, and level off the surface by wiping a putty knife over top. Instructions will vary slightly based on what kind of hole repair compound you use. Ensure the compound fills the entire the hole!"

      "content": "Protect areas you don’t want to paint with painter's tape. Rip pieces of painter’s tape 2–6 in (5.1–15.2 cm) long, and stick them to spots on your door you don’t want to get painted. In addition to your hardware and doorknob, you can run tape along the outer edges of your door so paint doesn't wind up on your entryway. Continue placing tape around your door until all your intended surfaces are covered. You can also lay down a drop cloth to help catch any paint drips. [3] X Research source Painter’s tape is sticky enough to adhere to your door but will not damage the surface below. You can purchase painter’s tape at home supply stores. It is usually blue in color and is often called masking tape."

You can also remove thick layers of previous paint by sanding your door. For best results, hand-sand the door with sandpaper, or you can also use a non-clogging sanding sponge. Then, sand until the surface of your door feels smooth. [4] X Research source You can also wipe down the door with a damp cloth after you sand to remove all the dust.

Purchase either oil-based primer for wooden doors or metal-safe primer for steel door frames. Then, use a 1 ⁄ 2 –1 in (1.3–2.5 cm) paintbrush about to apply an even layer over all of your door frame. Start at the top of your door, and paint with downward brush strokes. [7] X Research source Review the specific instructions on the container before you start.

If your door frame is narrow or skinny, use brushes about 1 ⁄ 4 – 1 ⁄ 2 in (0.64–1.27 cm) wide. This way, you avoid applying too much paint over the surface of your door. It is helpful to have a few different brushes to choose from. [10] X Research source Alternatively, use a mini roller for an extra-smooth finish."

Then, press your brush to your door starting at the top. Cover the top of your door frame, then work your way down the door. Continue painting until all surfaces of your door are covered. For best results, paint in 1 consistent direction. Avoid going up and down and then back and forth, as that often results in visible brush strokes. Be careful not to scoop up too much paint or dunk your brush too deep into the paint. If you apply an excess of paint, it may run down your door."
