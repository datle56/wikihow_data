      "content": "Keep your room cool. If your body is too hot or too cold, you might be adding physical stress to an already restless night. Sleep studies have found that a room temperature between 60-67 degrees Fahrenheit (or 15.5-19.4 degrees Celsius) is the ideal range for restful REM sleep. Check that windows are open or closed as needed, to allow for appropriate cooling and heating. Do this before getting into bed. Try using a fan.

      "content": "Listen to music. Music can have a powerful effect on the brain, and if you're feeling overly excited you may find it helpful to listen to soothing music.

Always consult with your doctor or primary care giver before taking any sleep aids or supplements."
