      "title": "Say \"Je ne parle pas français.\"",
      "content": "Say \"Je ne parle pas français.\" This means, \"I do not speak French.\" [2] X Research source It is pronounced: \"Juh nuh pahrl pah frahn-say\" (French speakers often leave out the \"ne\" in a negative sentence, or more commonly, slide it into the first word like \"zhun\" instead of \"juh nuh\". However, in writing always include the \"ne\"). If you speak a little French and want to tell the person that, you can say: \"Je parle juste un peu français.\" This is pronounced: \"Juh pahrle joost un puh frahn-say.\" It translates to, \"I speak just a little bit of French.\" Say: \"Je suis désolé.\" This means simply, \"I'm sorry,\" and can be combined with non-verbal gestures to communicate a lack of understanding. This is pronounced: \"juh swee day-zo-lay.\" If you're feeling ambitious (and polite), you can combine this with the previous step, saying \"Je suis désolé, je ne parle pas francais.\" This is pronounced: \"juh swee day-zo-lay, juh nuh pahrl pah frahn-say.\" This means, \"I'm sorry, I don't speak French.\" [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Say \"Je ne comprend pas.\"",
      "content": "Say \"Je ne comprend pas.\" This means, \"I do not understand.\" [4] X Research source It is pronounced \"Juh nuh comprahnd pah.\" This is less preferable to saying \"Je ne parle pas français,\" because the French person might misunderstand what you mean and try to explain what they said by speaking more French! However, if you can't remember \"Je ne parle pas français,\" \"Je ne comprend pas\" is better than nothing."
