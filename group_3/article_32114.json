If your bookcase is built-in, or too heavy to move, then protect your room by taping plastic tarps over any floor, walls, or furniture close to the painting. [1] X Research source"

Consider placing a fan facing out the window to blow out air and keep it circulating in the room.

      "content": "Wipe down your bookcase with a tack cloth. A tack cloth is a lint-free cloth that is slightly tacky (sticky), which means it can pick up dust much better than your average cleaning rag. Getting your furniture clean before you paint it is important so that you don't accidentally make specks of dirt stick to the furniture. [3] X Research source A dry cloth will get off most of the dust, but if you have more stubborn grit, just wet the cloth until it is slightly damp and rub it over the furniture."

      "content": "Shake a can of primer for 1 minute and practice spraying it on plywood. Hold the canister upside down and shake it vigorously. This will aerosolize the primer and make sure it is ready to spray. Practice spraying it on some plywood, by holding the primer about a foot (30cm) away, and moving closer and farther until you find a position that works best."

      "content": "Spray the primer over the bookcase and let it dry for 20 minutes. Move the can left to right and up and down as you spray. Apply the primer in a thin, even coat. Check the instructions on your particular primer to see if it requires one or two coats. [4] X Research source If it needs two coats, wait 20 minutes before applying the second coat.

Just as you did for the primer canister, shake the spray paint canister vigorously for 1 minute and then practice spraying it on a piece of cardboard.

Cover the bookcase completely in one coat of paint and let it dry. Spray beyond the edges of the bookcase to avoid drips at the edge.

      "content": "Let the bookcase dry overnight. Although spray paint dries pretty fast, it's best to make absolutely sure that your bookcase is dry before you touch it, move it, or load it up with books and knickknacks. Once your bookcase is dry, you can take away your drop cloth, and move your bookcase to wherever you want it."

Liquid paint doesn't emit as many fumes as spray-paint, but it's still important to ventilate your room by opening up windows and doors. Also lay down a drop cloth to protect your floor from paint drips.

      "content": "Sand your bookcase with 150-grit sandpaper. You can sand by hand if you like, but that takes a while. It's quicker to sand with a palm sander, a little machine you can attach sandpaper to. If your bookcase has a woodgrain, sand in the direction of the grain. Only sand enough to take away any shine that's on the surface. Don't gouge into the wood itself. You don't have to sand away all the old paint! Wear gloves and safety goggles to protect yourself from dust while you're sanding. [11] X Research source Wipe off the sanding dust with a tack cloth before continuing."

Choose a primer designed for use on the material your furniture is made from. You can use a spray-on primer, even if you want to paint the bookcase with a paintbrush. Or, you can use a paint-on primer. [12] X Research source Follow the instructions on the primer bucket for drying times. Some primers will dry in as few as 10-20 minutes, while others might need a few hours. [13] X Research source"

Latex paints, which are commonly used for walls, can sometimes remain tacky, which isn't good for putting books on. Stir your paint to make sure it's all a consistent color and test it on some scrap wood.

Most paints need about 6-8 hours to dry. Chalk paint, which sticks very well to unsanded wood, only takes about 30 minutes to dry.

If you have a large, built-in bookcase that you want to blend in seamlessly with the room, don't paint it the color of the trim or the woodwork. Instead, paint it the same color as your walls.

You can make each backing panel have the same wallpaper, or choose wallpapers that are all the same color but different patterns for an eye-catching look. You'll need to remove the shelves to paint the back, or, if they're not removable, apply painter's tape to the shelves so you don't accidentally paint them with the backing color."
