      "content": "Locate an available parking space. For an easier time parking, look for a parking space with another empty one next to it so that you don’t have to worry about getting too close to another parked car. If that isn’t possible, select the first empty parking space you find. If you are driving an SUV, a large truck, or an oversized vehicle, you should not attempt to park in a small space. Smaller parking spaces are best limited to smaller vehicles, such as compact cars. Attempting to park a large vehicle in a small space runs the risk of bumping into or scraping against another parked vehicle because there is no wiggle room, so to speak."

      "content": "Fold your side mirrors in, if possible. Once you have checked your mirrors as described in the previous step, if you have folding mirrors it is a good idea to fold in both the driver and passenger side mirrors before pulling into the parking space. In small parking spaces, vehicles parked next to one another run the risk of having the driver and/or passenger mirrors bump one another. Folding your driver and passenger side mirrors in will protect them from being broken off by other vehicles whose driver’s might not park as carefully as you."

[5] X Expert Source Ibrahim Onerli Driving Instructor Expert Interview. 18 November 2019. If there is a vehicle parked in the space next to the driver side of your car and that vehicle is extremely close to the line between parking spaces, park your car closer to the opposite side of your parking space. This will leave more room on the driver’s side so that you can safely open your door without hitting the other vehicle when getting out of your car. If the vehicles parked on either side of you are positioned in the center of their spaces, then you can also park your car in the middle of your spot rather than leaving extra space on the driver’s side."
