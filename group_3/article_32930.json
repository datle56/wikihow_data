      "content": "Purchase brown rice online or even at your local grocery store. If you want a specific or special kind of rice, you'll likely need to go online to find the seeds. Otherwise, you can just use brown rice from your grocery store, as the seeds are what you eat. Pick the least processed rice you can find, such as organic brown rice. [1] X Research source Don't pick white rice, as it has the shell of the seed removed. It won't germinate."

      "title": "Soak the grains in water for 24 hours.",
      "content": "Soak the grains in water for 24 hours. Place the rice grains in a bowl and cover them with water. Leave the grains in a warm area for the next 24 hours. When you come back and check on them, they should be sprouted. [2] X Research source If you're just using brown rice from the grocery store, you may not have high germination, meaning you may only see half your seeds sprout, for instance. If none of the seeds have sprouted, change the water and leave them for another 24 hours. Germinating the seeds this way may help increase the number of seeds that sprout. However, you can skip this process altogether; instead, you can prepare your pot with soil and water and simply drop the seeds into it to germinate in the soil."

      "title": "Place the seeds in a wet paper towel for 2-3 days.",
      "content": "Place the seeds in a wet paper towel for 2-3 days. Pull the seeds out of the water and put them in a damp paper towel. Place the towel in a plastic bag and seal it up. Then you can set it in a warm area for another couple of days. [3] X Research source Check on the seeds each day. You should see 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5.1 cm) of sprouting within a day or two."

    {
      "title": "Find 1-2 large pots.",
      "content": "Find 1-2 large pots. To grow enough rice to be of use to you, you should have several pots or buckets growing. Otherwise, if you just want an ornamental plant, you can use a single pot or bucket. You can use the large buckets you find at home improvement stores, for instance, or any large container, such as a clay pot. [4] X Research source Make sure your containers are at least 1 foot (0.30 m) deep and 1 to 2 feet (0.30 to 0.61 m) wide. Rice produces 10 pounds (4.5 kg) per 100 square feet (9.3 m 2 ). That means if you're only using containers that hold 1 to 2 square feet (0.093 to 0.186 m 2 ), you'll only get about 0.1 to 0.2 pounds (0.045 to 0.091 kg) of rice from your plants."

      "title": "Plug up the drainage holes if your container has any.",
      "content": "Plug up the drainage holes if your container has any. Unlike most plants, you don't want the water to drain away from the rice. Therefore, it's very important to either pick containers without holes or to plug up any holes the container has on the bottom. [5] X Research source Try using clay or rubber to plug up the bottom of the container. Make sure it's water-tight before adding the soil."

      "content": "Layer 6 to 8 inches (15 to 20 cm) of potting soil on the bottom. You need a solid amount of dirt for your rice to grow in. You can just use soil from your garden, but if you do, you'll need to add in compost or another fertilizer. Use about 1 part compost to 2 parts soil. Make sure you still have about 6 inches (15 cm) from the top of the pot to add water. [6] X Research source If you add soil from your garden, keep in mind it can carry pests and bacteria that you're bringing inside your home. Pre-packaged potting soil tends to be free of these problems. Don't pack the soil in. Keep it fairly loose. [7] X Research source Pick a potting soil that's designed to retain water. The bag will say \"good water retention\" or something to that effect. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Add enough water to cover the soil by 2 inches (5.1 cm). You will need to keep adding water to the container, as it will continue to soak into the soil for several minutes. Once it stops soaking in, fill the container up so the water level is 2 inches (5.1 cm) above the soil. [9] X Research source Your rice will need this amount of water for most of the time it's growing."

Spread out an even layer of rice, aiming for seeds every 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5.1 cm). [10] X Research source If your sprouts don't stand up in the water, you can use your fingers to push the roots down into the soil. [11] X Research source"

Set it up above the buckets so they have consistent light. If the area is drafty, try adding heating mats underneath the buckets to warm the water. [12] X Research source Make sure to set the pads on \"low,\" as you don't want the water to get too hot. Heating pads are generally used to help germinate seeds. You can buy them at garden stores or online."

Check the plants regularly to make sure they have enough water, maintaining the water at 2 inches (5.1 cm) above the soil.
