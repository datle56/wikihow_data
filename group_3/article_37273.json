Bosch dishwashers do will stop a cycle when you open the door, but it won’t reset everything. You won’t be able to change the settings until you reset. [1] X Research source Use caution, as the steam may be extremely hot when you open the door. This process applies to the following models: SHE4AM, SHE5AM, SHX3AM, SHE5AL, SHX5AL, SHSM63, SHS863, SHS843, SHVM63, SHV863, and SHX6AP. This includes all of the silence plus 44 dba and 42 dba models. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Hold the Start button for at least 3 seconds. In order to stop a cycle that is currently programmed on your Bosch dishwasher, hold the Start button for 3 seconds until the light indicating that the dishwasher is active fades. On most models, the screen will flash “0:01” when you’ve successfully reset the machine. [3] X Research source On some models, the “Clean” indicator will start flashing to show you’re now in setup mode. This will work whether the cycle is running or the display is stuck on a cycle that never started."

      "content": "Close the door and let the water drain automatically. If there is any water stuck at the bottom of the machine, it’ll start draining. If your door isn’t closed, shut the dishwasher door and wait around 1 minute for the water to drain. [4] X Research source If the machine was on its highest setting, it may take more time for all of the water to drain from the machine."

      "content": "Press the On/Off button to begin a new cycle. Once the dishwasher ends the cycle and the water fully drains, it needs to begin the entire cycle again from the start. To start from scratch, hit the On/Off button to turn the machine off. [5] X Research source On older models, you may need to hit it again to turn the machine on. [6] X Research source You’re now ready to roll! You should now be able to program your machine to run a new cycle. On some Bosch models, you can actually reset the machine just by turning it on and off."

      "content": "Unplug the dishwasher and wait 2-3 minutes before plugging in again. Pull the dishwasher out a little from the wall and unplug the machine. For some error messages and unresponsive displays, removing power from the appliance will clear it of the stored settings that created the problem. Plug the machine in again and start fresh. [7] X Research source Use caution that the cord is not wet and that there is no standing water behind the machine. Unplugging a large appliance with a wet cord can lead to electrocution."

Locate the fuse connected to your dishwasher (it should be labelled) and flip it off. Then, flip the fuse back on to open the circuit back up. [8] X Research source Remember that this will turn off all lights and appliances that are on the same circuit as the dishwasher. Wait for 2-3 minutes before switching the fuse back on."

      "content": "Fix an E-15 error by unplugging and tilting the machine. One of the most common Bosch dishwasher errors is the dreaded E-15, which is triggered by water making contact with a sensor on the bottom of the washer. This could be something innocuous, or it might be nothing. Either way, unplug the machine, pull it out from the wall, and gently tilt the machine from side to side to try and drain it.
