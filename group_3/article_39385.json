      "title": "Decide on a budget.",
      "content": "Decide on a budget. You'll want to decide how much you can spend before you go shopping, or you may end up blowing a ton of money. Figure out how much money you can dedicate for new clothes, and be sure to stick to your budget. Think about cost per wear. An item isn't a steal if you get it for $50 and only wear it once, but buying a jacket that costs $100 and wearing it for the entire winter is a smart purchase. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Choose which stores you visit based on what you need.",
      "content": "Choose which stores you visit based on what you need. You may be looking for something in particular, or you may just need a few everyday items. Consider whether your wardrobe is lacking in a particular area, such as work clothing or athletic wear. Perhaps you need a few new pairs of jeans, a nice suit, or something for a special occasion. Make a list of what you want or need, and stick to it. Consider sports stores for athletic wear and outdoor gear; check out department stores such as Nordstrom or Dillards for everyday items as well as fancy garments; or choose a brand-name outlet if you're looking for specific items, such as Levi's when you are in need of jeans. You can also look at outfits online to get an idea of what you like. Do an image search or go to a fashion website or even a clothing retailer website. Consider how items are put together to get an idea of what kinds of things you would like to wear. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Let your eye guide you.",
      "content": "Let your eye guide you. Pick out things that you are automatically drawn to. You want to purchase items that you truly love and that you'll feel great it. Trust your intuition and pick things that you think are fabulous. Don't worry too much about current trends or styles. Remember to think about what you will wear with the new item. If you are purchasing separates, be sure you have pants or a skirt that will coordinate with the top, and vice versa. If you are purchasing a dress or suit, consider if you have appropriate shoes and accessories to go with it. You don't want to end up with a bunch of items in your closet that you can't make complete outfits from."

    {
      "title": "Be selective.",
      "content": "Be selective. Only buy it if you really love it and are comfortable in it. Don't buy anything you may not want later or that does not fit properly, no matter how much its marked down from the \"original retail price.\" Also, consider if you have similar items; if you have three pea coats, you don't need another one, even if you like the color. Check the labels to see how high maintenance the item is, and if you're willing to care for it the way it needs to be so it lasts (i.e. hand wash only, needs ironed after every wash, etc.) If you know you're unlikely to take an item to the dry cleaners, don't purchase it if it's dry clean only.

    {
      "title": "Wear comfortable clothes.",
      "content": "Wear comfortable clothes. Wear clothes you feel good in and shoes that can easily slip on and off for shopping. Pay attention to the undergarments you have on; they should be ones you would wear under the clothes you plan to purchase (e.g., wear a strapless bra if you are looking for a strapless dress)."
    },
    {
      "title": "Eat before you go shopping.",
      "content": "Eat before you go shopping. Otherwise you'll quickly lose energy and may end up purchasing items just so you can be done. Bring a water bottle and a snack if you plan to be shopping for a while, or plan to take a break and have lunch while you're out."

    {
      "title": "Look through the entire store.",
      "content": "Look through the entire store. You may find several things you like on the first few racks, but that doesn't mean you should call it quits. Browse through different sections to ensure you see everything the store has to offer. You could also start shopping at the back of the store and work your way toward the front."

    {
      "title": "Ask a salesperson for help.",
      "content": "Ask a salesperson for help. If you're struggling to find the items or size you are looking for, ask a salesperson to help you choose things. Remember to be kind and courteous. They can bring you multiple sizes or similar styles. A salesperson may pair items you hadn't thought of, or bring you something that you hadn't considered before but end up loving. Keep in mind that it is their job to sell items, so don't decide to purchase something just because the salesperson says it looks great. Ensure you really like the item and are comfortable with the price before buying."

    {
      "title": "Inspect the garment.",
      "content": "Inspect the garment. Ensure the item is well-made and the fabric is high-quality. Look carefully to be sure there are no stains, tears, or missing items (buttons, decals, etc.) on the clothes. Check out the seams, zippers, etc. to be sure they are of good quality. If it is hard to fasten or there are lots of threads coming out of the stitching, don't buy it."
    },
    {
      "title": "Focus on fit.",
      "content": "Focus on fit. Avoid buying items with puckering seams, uneven hems, unsightly gaps, or other issues. Sit, stand, and stretch while using the mirrors provided in the fitting rooms to check every angle. If the item is too tight or gaps open while sitting, it's not the right item for you. Don't get it if you won't be comfortable while wearing it. Only buy items that will fit you now. Don't buy a different size hoping that you'll one day fit into it, or the piece may end up just hanging in your closet."

    {
      "title": "Know your size.",
      "content": "Know your size. Sizes can vary by brand, so it's a good idea to take your measurements before shopping online. Many manufacturers have a sizing chart available on the website, so consult this to be sure you're getting the right size before purchasing an item. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Shop around.",
      "content": "Shop around. One of the best things about online shopping is the convenience. It's easy to find multiple sellers for a single item. If you're looking for a specific item or brand, do a web search for that item. You'll get lots of results for the same thing, which makes it easy to compare prices and find the best deal."

    {
      "title": "Check comments and reviews.",
      "content": "Check comments and reviews. Spend some time reading comments and reviews from other customers so you will know what to expect when your package arrives in the mail. Other customers can let you know if an item didn't look or fit as advertised, as well as whether the quality of the item was high or low."

    {
      "title": "Look at the return policy.",
      "content": "Look at the return policy. Since you can't try on items you find online, make sure the store you are buying from has a good return policy. Ensure you can send the item back if it doesn't fit, and look for free return shipping to cut costs."
    },
    {
      "title": "Consider the shipping costs.",
      "content": "Consider the shipping costs. You may find a great deal on an item you love, but if the shipping costs are exorbitant you may end up paying far more than you'd like just to get the item in your hands. Look at the shipping costs for each item and store you want to purchase from. Some stores give discounts on shipping if you spend a certain amount, so consider buying several things from the same place."

      "content": "Try on items as soon as they are delivered. Some stores have time-sensitive return policies, and you don't want that new dress hanging in your closet for weeks before you realize it's too big. Try things on as soon as you receive them so you know whether to send things back or keep them. [5] X Research source"
