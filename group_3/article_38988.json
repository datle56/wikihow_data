      "content": "Turn the timer’s dial to the current time. Use mechanical pin timers indoors or outdoors. Look for the arrow on the front of the dial on your mechanical timer . Then, rotate the dial clockwise until the arrow points at the current time. Most timers are broken down into 30-minute intervals, so it’s okay if the time isn’t precise down to the minute as long as the arrow is generally near the right time. It might be easier to set your timer on the hour so you can point the arrow directly at one of the numbers. Most timers have light and dark markings over the numbers to distinguish between AM and PM hours. Other timers may list the hours in military time instead."

      "content": "Push the timer pins in for the times you want the timer turned on. The small gray buttons around the outside of the dial are the timer pins. Start with all the pins pulled out as far as they can go. Find the times on the dial when you want your lights to turn on, and push down all of the pins within that range. Keep the pins pulled out for when you want your devices to power down. If there are 2 pins for every hour on the dial, then each pin represents 30 minutes. Some timers have 4 pins per hour, so each one represents 15 minutes. If your mechanical timer doesn’t have built-in pins, then it will have separate pins to insert. Push the pin into the slot on the dial’s inner circle when you want your devices to turn on, and add a pin to the outer circle when you want them to turn off."

      "content": "Flip the manual switch button to the \"Timer” setting. Check the top or side of your outlet timer for a gray or white switch. If the switch is in the “On” or “Off” position, move it to the setting labeled “Timer” instead. That way, anything you plug into the timer will turn on during the intervals you set. [1] X Research source You can always manually override the timer intervals by changing the switch to “On.” If you don’t want to keep your devices turned off even while the timer is running, then use the “Off” setting. When using your plug timer outdoors, plug it in so it’s at least 2 feet (0.61 m) above the ground to prevent it from getting wet and shorting out."

Just plug the timer directly into the outlet without any intermediate devices.

Switch the light or other device you plugged in to the \"On\" position so it automatically turns on when the timer reaches one of the intervals. To avoid fires, avoid connecting your timer to appliances like irons, heaters, and cooking appliances. Check the electrical rating on the plug timer and compare it to the device you’re plugging into. If the device requires more power than the timer can handle, then avoid plugging it in. To test if your timer has power, turn the manual switch to the “On” position. Your device will power up right away."

If it’s a normal button, just press it with your finger to clear all of the saved time intervals. If the button is small and hard to press, then try pressing it in with a toothpick instead.

[5] X Research source Follow the directions that came with your specific model of plug timer since you may need to press or hold down different buttons to program the clock and time intervals. Double-check that you have AM or PM set correctly on your timer so it doesn’t come on at the wrong times. Digital timers have a small internal battery, so you don’t need to plug them in before you program them."

Press the “Week” button until all of the days you want the program to activate are lit up. You may find special settings labeled “Weekdays” or “Weekends” to only have the cycle active during those times. Use the arrows or the “Hour” and “Minute” buttons to set the time when your devices turn on. Press the “Timer” button again to set the days and times when you want your devices to turn off.

Click the button on the display until it reads “On-Auto-Off” so your lights and devices only turn on during the specified intervals you just programmed. If you use the “On” setting, your devices will turn on automatically and won’t turn off on their own, just like if you plugged them in without a timer. If you put your timer on “Off” mode, then your devices won’t turn on automatically during the intervals."
