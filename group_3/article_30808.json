Stir the Nutella with a wooden or metal spoon and remove it the jar from the water if it's melted. If not, let the Nutella sit in the hot water until it's melted. This is a gentle way of heating the Nutella because you won't actually cook or overheat it."

Run hot water into a cup and put the spoon or knife in the hot water. Let it sit in the cup for about one minute. This will heat up the metal. [1] X Research source You can also buy an electric butter spreader. This small knife will actually warm itself so you can use it to scoop out and melt a small amount of Nutella."

Keep spreading the Nutella until the heat from the knife or spoon melts it. [3] X Research source If your knife or spoon cools off too much, just wipe it clean and reinsert it into the hot water, coffee or tea for another minute. Then you can continue to spread and melt the Nutella."
