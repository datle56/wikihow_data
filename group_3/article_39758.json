      "content": "A sip and see is an informal gathering where family and friends meet your new baby. Think of it as an addition (or alternative) to a traditional baby shower. Instead of people popping in over time, a sip and see lets everyone welcome your new arrival together—typically, when the baby is 3-6 months old. Guests get to sip on refreshments, enjoy cute, light décor, and visit with your little one. [1] X Research source A sip and see party typically lasts for one to two hours, with a firm start and end time to avoid overwhelming the new parents and baby. [2] X Research source For a similar reason, guest lists are usually smaller than at a baby shower. [3] X Research source Unlike a baby shower, you hold a sip and see after the baby is born and usually host it yourself (so you don’t have to travel with your newborn!). Another key difference: gifts aren’t expected like they would be at a baby shower or sprinkle, since by this time you likely already have what you need. [4] X Research source If guests ask to bring gifts, however, you can set up a registry. [5] X Research source The sip and see originated in the Southern US. Guests would sip tea and see the baby—but now, tea is frequently swapped for other beverages. [6] X Research source Refreshment ideas include coffee, cocktails, or juice."

      "title": "Decide on a host and theme.",
      "content": "Decide on a host and theme. Parents often host their own sip and see so they don’t have to travel with their new baby—and so the baby can meet new people in a familiar environment. Once you’ve chosen a host, decide on a cute theme—that will guide you through which invitations, food, beverages, and decorations to get for your sip and see. If you’d like a close family member or friend to throw your party , that’s totally fine. You’ll have less to stress about in terms of set-up and clean-up, so you can focus on your baby’s comfort. [7] X Research source Theme ideas include travel, children’s books, bees, and animals. See more theme ideas and suggestions below!"

      "title": "Send out invitations.",
      "content": "Send out invitations. Because a sip and see party is a casual gathering, an e-vite (digital invitation) is acceptable. Use an e-vite service that tracks RSVPs, such as Facebook’s event invite system, so you can plan accordingly when buying refreshments. If you’d like to send out physical invitations, consider featuring a photo of your new bundle of joy. [8] X Research source Include the occasion, the date, the time (start and end, taking into account the baby’s nap times), the location, and RSVP contact info on your invitations. [9] X Research source You can also politely request that guests don’t bring gifts. When it comes to dress codes, you can specify more formal attire—just keep in mind that guests who hold your baby risk getting their clothes soiled. [10] X Research source Match invitations to your theme with the help of a template. Sites like Canva and Adobe Express feature free, easy-to-customize invitation templates around many sip and see party themes—just search “[theme] party invite” to find the best one for your event."

      "content": "Coordinate set-up and clean-up. If someone else is hosting for you, this shouldn’t be necessary. But if you’re the host, make sure you have a plan for set-up and clean-up—whether that means simplifying the décor so it’s easy to take down, or asking a family member or friend to help you put it all together. [11] X Research source Allow yourself enough time to purchase or order any decorations. Maciel suggests you start by making a Pinterest board with inspirational ideas for décor. Then, you can “go shopping at regular party stores like Party City [or] Amazon” to pick up supplies. Keep in mind the size of the space where you’re holding the sip and see party so you fill the space, but don’t clutter it. Wondering what to decorate with? \"Balloon garlands, backdrops, and props” are popular choices for outdoor parties,\" says Maciel. You can order them on Amazon to set up yourself—or, use a party rental service that will provide decor and handle set-up and take-down."

You can also politely let guests know if you’d rather not have anyone hold or kiss your baby to avoid germs. [12] X Research source Getting to see and celebrate the little one is already a treat."

      "title": "Relax and have fun.",
      "content": "Relax and have fun. A sip and see is a casual, fun event celebrating your new arrival. Because there are fewer guests and less elaborate decorations and refreshments than at a baby shower or baby sprinkle, the focus can be on your baby. Don’t forget to enjoy yourself during the event—mingle, sample refreshments, and take pictures if you’d like! Use a Polaroid camera in addition to taking pictures on your phone or Canon. You can save the pictures in your baby’s scrapbook so they can see their first party when they’re older."

      "content": "Ask before you hold the baby —and wash your hands first. Hand sanitizer may be provided and required, or the hosts could ask you to wash your hands before holding the baby. If the parents prefer that guests not hold the baby, respect their wishes—the baby’s health and comfort comes first. [13] X Research source Wondering how to politely ask to hold the little one? First, wait until the baby is awake—you don’t want to interrupt nap time! Then, simply ask the parent, “Can I hold her/him?” Avoid asking to hold the baby while they’re nursing or upset. Similarly, don’t ask someone who’s holding the baby but isn’t the baby’s parent. Every parent has their own preferences for who holds their baby, and it’s their decision to make."

      "title": "Bring a small gift if you’d like.",
      "content": "Bring a small gift if you’d like. Gifts aren’t typically expected at a sip and see, but you can always bring one if you’d like. The hosts may not open it during the party, since getting gifts isn’t the focus of the event like it would be at a baby shower. [14] X Research source Still, they’re sure to appreciate it! If you already gave a gift at a baby shower or sprinkle, but still want to bring something, consider a gift for the parents—for example, a nice home-cooked meal. [15] X Research source If you know the theme of the sip and see party in advance, consider bringing a gift that matches the theme. For example, if the theme is children’s books, bring a new copy of your favorite children’s book for the little one’s bookshelf. If the theme is space, you can bring a star-themed baby toy, a plush rocket ship, or a planet-themed mobile."
