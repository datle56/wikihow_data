      "title": "Practice self-awareness.",
      "content": "Practice self-awareness. One of the most important ways to learn to become respectful of other cultures is to spend some time reflecting on your own beliefs and biases. Each of us has what is known as a \"filter\". The filter impacts how we see other cultures. Your filter describes the way you view the world. Many different factors can affect your filter. Some factors that affect your view, or filter, are ethnic background, religion, and age. Your filter is also affected by your income level and your education level. Spend some time reflecting on your filter. Ask yourself questions such as, \"How does my income affect the way I look at others?\" or \"Do I have any biases because of my religion?\" Becoming more self-aware can help you realize new things about your own culture. This, in turn, can open your eyes to appreciating cultural differences."

Start by reading about the culture you are interested in. [1] X Trustworthy Source Kansas University Center for Community Health and Development Community-based research center focused on supporting public health development and education Go to source For example, if you are interested in Japanese culture, look for a book on the history of Japan. Background knowledge of the history can help you comprehend the culture. You can also try fiction. Reading a fictional account of a new culture can give you a more clear understanding of what life is like in that culture. Try reading Chinua Achebe's \"Things Fall Apart\" for an interesting story about life in Nigeria. Or consider reading Elizabeth Gilbert's \"Eat, Pray, Love\" to learn about Italy, India, and Indonesia. Ask your local librarian for guidance. Ask for recommendations for both fiction and non-fiction works."

Also take care to ask about any guidelines for dress or behavior. Do your research. Read books and newspaper articles about different religions. For example, you could read about what it means to be a Buddhist."

[4] X Trustworthy Source Kansas University Center for Community Health and Development Community-based research center focused on supporting public health development and education Go to source Often, people in the cultural minority suffer discrimination. You can show that you will not respect discrimination in any form. For example, maybe one of your coworkers makes culturally insensitive jokes. You can try saying, \"Bob, I know you mean well, but that kind of comment is offensive to myself and others.\" Stand up for the rights of others in your community. For example, if your city tries to block the building of a mosque, attend a city council meeting and make your voice heard."

      "content": "Correct misunderstandings. You might have some prior assumptions about other cultures. For example, if you are traveling in India, you might start to think that people are not honest. It can be really difficult to get a thorough answer to a direct question. [5] X Research source However, in India, it is common and polite to not always directly answer questions. Take time to observe other people interacting so that you can personally observe cultural differences. Many British people think that Americans are fake. That is because Americans typically tend to be more outwardly optimistic than people from other cultures. When you are speaking to a British person, take time to speak genuinely. You can teach each other about your cultural differences. Your own cultural filter might make you nervous to approach a woman wearing a hijab. But don't be afraid to go up to her on the bus and say, \"Excuse me, is this seat taken?\""

Just make sure to do so in a respectful manner. Maybe you have a coworker who has a habit of bringing interesting foods for lunch. Try saying, \"What is that you're eating? It smells great.\" Perhaps you have a co-worker who routinely arrives at the office later than others. Instead of assuming that she is lazy, ask a friendly question. You might learn that your boss has agreed to accommodate her prayer schedule. If you have a friend who is from Japan, ask him about the custom of bowing. He will likely be delighted to talk to you about his culture."

For example, go into a new experience ready to learn something new. [6] X Research source Maybe you are traveling in Asia. The food might not be what you are used to, but be willing to try new things. Be aware that just because people behave differently does not make them better or worse than you. For example, Middle Easterners often engage in more elaborate greetings and small talk than most Americans. Be willing to participate in new types of conversations. You'll likely learn something, and you might also enjoy it. Outwardly demonstrate your respect. Do not roll your eyes or scowl when you encounter an unfamiliar sight."

If children grow up understanding different cultures, they will be less likely to discriminate as adults. Take time to teach your kids about other cultures. [7] X Research source If your child comes home from school and asks you why his friend can't play on Saturdays, you can use that as a teaching moment. Explain that some faiths or cultures observe Saturday as a holy day. Look for a school that teaches multiculturalism. Before enrolling your child, ask if there are multiple languages taught, or if the kids will be exposed to different kinds of art. Set a good example. If you behave with kindness and respect, your children are more likely to model that behavior."

For example, if you decide to travel to the United Arab Emirates, be aware that women are expected to dress modestly. Try some \"local\" activities. When you travel, there are many typical tourist sites that you will want to see. But don't be afraid to ask a local to point you towards their favorite neighborhood. Be aware of your safety. You want to enjoy yourself, but make sure that you are always aware of your surroundings and using common sense."
