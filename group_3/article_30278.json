You will need: [1] X Research source Fabric in the color and type of your choice. A lightweight fabric is ideal for this type of dress, such as cotton, voile, jersey, or viscose rayon. [2] X Research source You will need about 3 to 5 yards (3 to 5 m), depending on the desired width and length of your dress. Elastic. You will need enough elastic to go around your chest and shoulders separately. Choose elastic that is about ½” (1.3 cm) to 1” (2.5 cm) wide. Scissors Measuring tape Pins Safety pin Sewing machine"

      "content": "Decide how long you want the dress to be. You can make your off the shoulder dress as long or as short as you like. To decide on a length, drape the fabric around your body so that the top edge of the fabric is going around the center of your upper bust (right around your armpits). [3] X Research source Then, mark the fabric about 2 inches (5 cm) below where you would like the dress to fall."

This will help you to determine how loose or fitted you want the dress to be. Wrap the fabric around you and adjust it until it is as loose or fitted as you want it to be. Then, mark the edge of the fabric to indicate where you will need to cut the fabric. [4] X Research source"

Drape the fabric around your shoulders and mark it to indicate the width and length of the piece. [5] X Research source This piece will need to be wide enough to easily wrap around your shoulders and long enough to extend down from the center of your chest to about the middle of your abdomen. If you want the piece to be slightly ruffled, then it will need to be about 1 and ½ times the width of your shoulders. [6] X Research source For example, if your shoulder measurement is 30” (76.2 cm) then your shoulder piece will need to be about 45” (114.3 cm) wide. You can also increase the ruffling by doubling or even tripling your measurement if desired. Make sure that the shoulder piece will be long enough to cover your chest without extending down too far. Add a 2” (5 cm) seam allowance to the width and length as well."

Wrap the measuring tape so that it goes under your armpits and around your chest. Record this measurement. Then, wrap the measuring tape around your shoulders just above the line around your armpits and record this measurement as well. Add 2” (5 cm) to each measurement to provide seam allowance. Make sure you take careful measurements, especially around your chest—the bodice of the dress needs to fit perfectly for the off-shoulder part to look right.

[11] X Research source The fabric will bunch up as you go, but you can adjust it after you are finished to ensure that it is evenly spaced along the elastic. Make sure to insert the correct elastic pieces into their corresponding pieces of fabric. For example, your shoulder elastic piece will need to go into the seam of the shoulder fabric piece."

When you are happy with the positioning of the pieces, stitch a line down the front and back of the elastic at the very center of the front and back to secure the pieces together. You can simply stitch up and down the width of the elastic pieces two or three times to ensure that they are secured. [14] X Research source Use a thread color that will blend in well with your fabric. This will help to ensure that the stitching is not as noticeable. Make sure that there is an even amount of shoulder piece fabric on either side of the dress piece. Otherwise, your dress may end up looking lopsided. Make sure to sew through both layers of the elastic and fabric."
