      "content": "Fill a clean bathtub or sink with enough warm water to cover the roses. Stop up the drain and turn on the warm water tap to fill a sink or bathtub with enough water to cover the roses. The temperature of the water should be lukewarm or a little hotter. About 5 inches (13 cm) to 6 inches (15 cm) of water should do it. Make sure your bathtub or sink is free of grime and soaps before you fill it with water for the rose bath."

Turn on the faucet until you have a stream of warm water. Position the stem under the stream and use garden shears to slice off at least 1 inch (2.5 cm) of the stem at a diagonal angle. [2] X Research source The diagonal angle allows the stem to take in more water. Cutting the stems under warm running water prevents air bubbles from stopping up the stem's tissues responsible for taking in water. If you're bathing the roses in the sink, use a different sink to recut them or, if possible, use the other side of the sink."

      "content": "Submerge the roses in the warm water bath for about 20 to 60 minutes. Place each stem horizontally into the bath and push them down so that each rose (the heads included) are fully submerged in the water. This may not revive your roses if they're extremely wilted, especially if the neck shows any signs of shriveling. The idea is that the roses will absorb enough water to be revived."

Pour out the soiled water and then refill it to just above the water line with tap water, 2 tablespoons (29.6 ml) (30 grams) of baking soda, and 2 tablespoons (30 mL) of white vinegar. Let it fizz and settle for about 30 minutes before wiping away any film with a cloth or bottle brush. Thoroughly rinse the vase before you use it again.

If you bought your roses or had them delivered, they probably came with a packet of flower food. If you need more, you can buy flower preservative (AKA flower feed or flower food) at any floral shop or grocery store that has a nursery. The roses can take in warm water better than cold water. You can also make your own flower food by using 2 tablespoons (30 mL) of white vinegar and 2 tablespoons (29.6 ml) (30 grams) of sugar for each 32 fluid ounces (950 mL) of water."

If the heads are starting to bend, carefully cradle them with your free hand while you replace them. Make sure the roses are placed as vertically as possible to prevent the heads from drooping any further."

Fill a bowl with warm water or hold the stems under warm running water as you snip off 1 inch (2.5 cm) from the end of the stem. Cut it at a 45-degree angle to increase the surface area of the stem, allowing the rose to take in more water. [5] X Research source You don’t have to snip them under water, but it helps keep air bubbles out of stem and, as a result, increasing the amount of water the rose can absorb. [6] X Expert Source Pilar Zuniga Floral Designer & Owner, Gorgeous and Green Expert Interview. 12 March 2020. If the stems are super thick and woody, use a pair of sharp garden shears. Avoid using regular scissors or dull blades because they can crush the base of the stem and decrease how much water it can take in."

Wash the vase in hot, soapy water and rinse it well before refilling it with tap water and replacing the roses. If there is grime or film stuck on the sides of the vase, you may want to soak it with water, vinegar, and baking soda for 1 to 2 hours. [8] X Research source If your tap water is extra soft, you may want to use distilled water because soft water has higher sodium (which isn’t good for roses). To do a soak, fill up the vase with hot water and add 2 tablespoons (29.6 ml) (30 grams) of baking soda and 2 tablespoons (30 mL) of white vinegar. Let it sit for 1 to 2 hours before wiping the inside with a scrub brush or sponge."

If your roses came with a packet of flower food, look at the back of the package to determine how much to use.

Place a shovel into the dirt about 8 inches (20 cm) to 12 inches (30 cm) away from the base of the plant to make sure you don’t sever the root system. Do this 4 or 5 times on each side of the plant until you can wiggle and lift the entire plant with ease. [15] X Research source Once it’s uprooted, the plant will pop out of the ground and rest on its side.

If you’re using a soil moisture meter, you should water when the meter shows that 50% of the soil is dry. [21] X Research source To avoid over-watering, pour in 32 fluid ounces (950 mL) of water at a time and let it settle through the soil so you can gauge how much more you need to add.
