You can certainly exceed 8 as well, but with more than 4 people per team, it isn’t possible for everyone to be involved in the action at the same time."

Place 4 cups in a straight line centered at each end of the table. Then, along each side of the table, place 3 cups at even intervals. [2] X Research source"

For cleanliness, don't drink from these cups on the edge of the table, as you will be attempting to shoot the ball into these cups, and the ball can get a bit gross throughout the game. [3] X Research source Additionally, by filling these cups with water, you’ll avoid any bothersome stickiness on the ball."

      "content": "Throw balls into the cups on the opposite end of the table. Like in baseball , offensive players bat, attempting to earn hits and get on base. Unlike baseball though, batters in this game stand behind their end of the table and attempt to land the ball into one of the 4 cups on their opponent’s side. If their ball lands in the first cup, they hit a single and advance to 1st base: the first cup on their right. If their ball lands in the second cup, they hit a double and advance to 2nd base: the second cup on their right. If their ball lands in the third cup, they hit a triple and advance to 3rd base: the third cup on their right. Finally, if their ball lands in the fourth cup, they hit a home run and score 1 point—known as a run—for their team!

If a ball bounces off a cup, and the catcher catches it before it hits the table or floor, the batter is also out.

To steal a base, baserunners must beat defenders in a game of flip cup. The runner begins the steal attempt at any time by picking up and drinking their cup, then placing it back on the edge of the table and attempting to flip it so that it lands upside-down on the table. [8] X Research source The defender across from the runner attempts to do the same. If the defender successfully flips their cup first, they have caught the runner stealing and they are out.
