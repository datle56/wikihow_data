[2] X Research source If you've lost this paperwork, contact your old state's DMV to get copies so you can register your car in California.

Download the form at https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/file/application-for-title-or-registration-reg-343-pdf/ so you can fill it out before you go to the DMV. Most of the information you can probably copy off of your old registration form. [3] X Research source All owners currently listed on the title have to sign the application, even if the registration is only going to be in your name. For example, if you're a college student moving to California and your parents are also listed on your car's title, they have to sign the registration application. That's why it's a good idea to fill this out before you move."

If your insurance company also provides insurance in California, all you'll have to do is change the address where your car is kept and used (which your insurance company would require you to do anyway). If your insurance company doesn't offer California insurance, you'll need to switch companies. Your new insurance company will take over and your old insurance will no longer be in effect. [4] X Research source California requires liability insurance with coverage of at least $15,000 for the injury or death of one person, $30,000 for the injury or death of more than one person, and $5,000 for damage to property.

Yes, generally you can buy a car outside of California and register it in California without any problems.

[18] X Research source If you're looking at a new car in another state, check the emissions label under the hood. If it says it's a 50-state car, you're good to go. If the car says it's a \"49-state\" car, that means it was manufactured to meet the federal emissions standards, but not the stricter California ones. If you buy the car new, you won't be able to register or drive it in California."

[19] X Research source To get an estimate of how much it'll cost you to register your car, go to https://www.dmv.ca.gov/wasapp/FeeCalculatorWeb/newResidentForm.do and enter information about your car along with the county, city, and ZIP of your residence."

To transfer the title in California, you need a California title—so it makes sense to transfer the title in the state you're coming from before you move to California. [20] X Research source Then, you would register as usual with the title and registration from the previous state. For example, if your child is going to school in California and taking a car that's in your name, transfer the title from your name to theirs before they leave for school. Then, they can register the car once they get to California and you won't have to be involved."

If your payment is less than one year late, the penalty is 40% of the license fee you owe (in addition to the regular taxes and fees). After a year, the penalty goes up to 80% of the fee on top of the regular payment. [22] X Research source Your registration fees are due within 20 days of the date you establish residency in California. To avoid penalties, go ahead and submit your application and pay the fees before that date—even if you don't have all the inspections or paperwork you need. [23] X Research source"
