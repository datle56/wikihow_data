      "content": "Attach the neck to the body of the saxophone. Lay your case on a hard, flat surface and open it, then grab the body of the saxophone (the biggest piece containing all of the keys and the bell, or the flared opening). Grab the body by the bell or hold it from the bottom to avoid pressing into the delicate keys. The body most likely has a plastic end plug inserted into the narrower end opposite the bell—if so, slide or wiggle it out.​ [1] X Research source Then, loosen the screw at the very top of the instrument, but don’t unscrew it all the way. Next, grab the neck (a shorter, curved piece with a ring of cork on one end) and wiggle the wider, metal end of the neck into the top of the saxophone. Finally, tighten the screw to hold the neck firmly in place. Tip: At the top of the body is a short metal prong (maybe capped with plastic) sticking straight up toward where the neck goes. This prong goes under the looped metal piece in the back of the neck. Tip: If you’re having trouble getting the neck into place, loosen the screw some more or apply cork grease to the neck to help it glide in more smoothly."

      "title": "Slide the mouthpiece onto the cork end of the neck.",
      "content": "Slide the mouthpiece onto the cork end of the neck. Next, grab the mouthpiece (a small black piece made of hard rubber) and gently twist and push the circular opening over the corked end of the neck. Push it until it’s snug and secure on the neck, but don’t push it all the way to the end of the cork (as you get to learn your instrument, you’ll figure out the “sweet spot” for the mouthpiece to play in tune—pushing it in all the way will make all of your notes sound too high, or “sharp”). [2] X Research source If you’re struggling to slide the mouthpiece on, rub cork grease on the cork of the neck to help it slide into place. Brand new saxes have stiff cork that might be difficult to put the mouthpiece on at first. As you play more and break it in, the mouthpiece will begin to go on easier."

      "title": "Attach your reed to the mouthpiece with the ligature.",
      "content": "Attach your reed to the mouthpiece with the ligature. The reed is the small, wooden slat that vibrates against the rectangular opening in the mouthpiece to produce sound (without it, you can’t play the sax!). The ligature is the metal ring with tightening screws that holds the reed onto the mouthpiece. To assemble: [3] X Research source Place the thin end of the reed in your mouth to wet it for at least a few seconds (a bone dry reed is extremely difficult to make a nice sound on). While you’re wetting the reed, slide the ligature over the mouthpiece. One side of the ligature will be slightly wider than the other to match the shape of the mouthpiece. Typically, the screws on the ligature will go on the underside of the mouthpiece and point to the right (although some models may be different). Gently suck or pat excess moisture from the reed (you shouldn’t see any spit droplets or streaks) and slide the thick end between the ligature and mouthpiece. The flat side of the reed goes against the rectangular opening in the mouthpiece. Adjust the reed so that it’s perfectly aligned with the flat opening of the mouthpiece (it’s not angled to the left or right). The tip of the reed should be flush with or just slightly below the tip of the mouthpiece. Tighten the screws on the ligature so the reed is firmly secured and doesn’t move."

      "content": "Hook the neck strap onto the metal loop in the back of the instrument. Look at the back of the body for a small metal circle or loop. Hook the attachment end of the neck strap here, then place the neck strap over your head so it lies against the back of your neck. You’re now fully assembled and ready to play! [4] X Research source To disassemble your sax: Loosen the ligature and remove the delicate reed first (pat it dry and store it in the plastic sleeve it came in to prevent chipping or cracking). Take off the neck strap, then slide a cleaning cloth or swab through the entire instrument to remove moisture. Gently take apart the mouthpiece, neck, and body, and put the end plug back in. Store your sax in its case with the latches or zipper fully closed."

Scoot toward the front of the seat so you’re not leaning on the backrest. Some find it helpful to slide over a tiny bit to the right side of the seat so that your right leg is hanging slightly over the edge. This frees up that side of your body to hold the saxophone and prevents you from banging it against the chair. [5] X Research source Avoid comfortable chairs with armrests, like recliners, since these make it difficult to maintain good posture. Go for a harder chair like a folding chair or kitchen chair. Keep your head level and avoid tilting it to the right or left"

Tighten the neck strap by pulling the plastic adjuster until there is no slack. [6] X Research source There should be tension in the strap when the instrument is in your lap. When you’re ready to play, you can make minor adjustments up or down so the mouthpiece comes up to your lips (more on this below)."

Wrap your fingers gently around the instrument and rest your right fingertips on the bottom 3 pearls (the white, shiny circles on top of the larger brass keys).

Use your right hand to push the body of the sax up and slightly forward to bring the mouthpiece up to your mouth. If your neck strap is properly adjusted, the mouthpiece should come up directly in front of your mouth. Your left hand helps to balance the sax. [11] X Research source If the mouthpiece isn't coming all the way up to your mouth, your neck strap is too long. Adjust it to shorten it. Vice versa, if the mouthpiece sits above your lips or feels like it’s being jammed into your mouth, the neck strap may be too short (this is a less common problem). Remember to maintain your tall, relaxed posture while adjusting the neck strap. The mouthpiece should come up to meet you—you shouldn’t have to stoop down to meet the mouthpiece."

For the sax: [12] X Research source Curve your lower lip over your bottom teeth. The “line” where your lip ends and your facial skin begins is about where your teeth should be. Firm up the corners of your mouth by making an “oh” or “ew” shape. Put about ½ inch (1.3 cm) or so of the mouthpiece into your mouth. Keep your bottom lip firm and let the reed rest on it without “biting” upward and into the reed. Let your top teeth rest and sink into the top of the mouthpiece without biting down. Form an airtight seal around the mouthpiece with your lips. Picture your upper lip coming down to “hug” the top of the mouthpiece, keeping the lip pressed gently against your top teeth. Make a super faint frown to firm up the corners of your lips against the sides of the mouthpiece. Tip: Make sure the reed is centered on your lower lip. Try to place equal pressure on the mouthpiece from all sides of your embouchure. Fun fact: The saxophone embouchure is very similar to a clarinet embouchure. This is why so many musicians are able to play both instruments fairly easily!"

      "title": "Blow air into the mouthpiece without pressing any keys.",
      "content": "Blow air into the mouthpiece without pressing any keys. Your goal here is to create a clear, consistent sound as you blow into the mouthpiece (you’ll add fingers to play different notes later). With your mouthpiece in your mouth, loosen up the corners of your embouchure just enough to take in a deep breath (do not inhale through your nose). Firm up your corners and then blow a fast, steady airstream into the instrument. Engage your core muscles to power the airstream, rather than pushing from your chest or throat. [13] X Research source Picture a narrow, pressurized airstream, like you would make if you were blowing through a straw or trying to blow out a birthday candle. Avoid a slow, wide air stream (like you’d use to fog up a window). Keep your embouchure firm to prevent any air from leaking out around the mouthpiece. If the sound is weak, airy, or fluctuates up and down in pitch, your airstream is not supportive enough. Firm up your embouchure a bit and blow faster to stabilize the sound. You’ll know you’ve found the right air support when you hear a clear, steady pitch that doesn’t “wobble” or cut in and out. Tip: Keep your tongue in a natural, relaxed arch (like you’re saying the syllable “ee”) instead of letting it drop into a low, flat “ah” shape. This channels the air forward into the mouthpiece instead of allowing it to go sideways and puff out your cheeks."

    {
      "title": "Practice articulating the sound.",
      "content": "Practice articulating the sound. On wind instruments, articulation (also called tonguing) is a way to break up your air stream into distinct chunks that cause notes to sound separated. Without stopping your airstream, lightly tap the top of the tip of your tongue against the reed, just underneath the tip. When your tongue touches the reed, the sound is temporarily blocked. When you move your tongue back, the sound resumes. Use a “dee dee dee” or “tee tee tee” motion in your tongue. Try to keep the movement isolated to the front portion of your tongue, keeping the middle and back still. [14] X Research source Imagine slicing your hand through a stream of water coming out of a hose. The water (AKA your air) doesn’t stop, but the interruption from your hand breaks up the stream into “pieces” (AKA separate notes). Tonguing works the same way! Once you’re comfortable articulating, practice starting your first note with your tongue light yon the reed. Release the tongue as you begin blowing to start the note with articulation. Tip: Avoid huffing and puffing (starting and stopping your airstream) to articulate. This is a common habit that beginners fall into."

Place your left index finger on the top pearl key and press down gently so the large pad underneath seals over the tone hole in the instrument. Blow through the mouthpiece. The sound you hear is the note B! [15] X Research source Note: There’s an additional key above the B pearl—on some instruments it’s a brass, teardrop-shaped key, and on others it’s another pearl-looking button. Make sure your index finger is on the second button down from the top in either case."

Make sure you maintain a proper embouchure as you blow, and be sure to keep your cheeks tucked in. [18] X Research source With your “G” fingers down, press the first bottom key down with your right index finger for an F. Add your right middle finger on the 2nd pearl key to play an E. Add your right ring finger on the 3rd pearl key to play a D. The right-hand notes are a bit easier to find because there are only 3 pearl keys on the bottom half of the instrument."

[20] X Research source Scales are the building blocks of all tonal Western music, from classical to pop to jazz to rock—the more of them you know, the easier you’ll be able to learn and play all different kinds of songs and genres. In classical music, there are 12 major scales and 12 minor scales. Check out this online guide to minor scales on sax and this guide for major scales .

      "title": "What key is the alto saxophone in?",
      "content": "What key is the alto saxophone in? The alto sax is pitched in E-flat. This means that when you play a C on the alto sax, the pitch that comes out is actually the E-flat below the C you’re playing. [21] X Research source This is because the alto sax is a transposing instrument, meaning that the pitch you read and play on the instrument is not the same as the concert pitch (the actual pitch) that comes out. Lots of wind instruments are transposing instruments. These include the entire sax family, the clarinet family, the English horn, and some brass instruments like the trumpet, French horn, or euphonium."

Yes, the alto sax is considered a beginner-friendly instrument (although true mastery of the sax—or any instrument—is challenging and takes time and hard work).

      "title": "What are the types of saxophones?",
      "content": "What are the types of saxophones? The core saxophone family includes the soprano, alto, tenor, and baritone (bari) saxes. The soprano sax is pitched in B-flat and is the highest-pitched member of the group (it’s smaller than an alto and looks more like a golden clarinet than a curved sax). The next highest is the alto, followed by the tenor sax (the tenor looks like a jumbo alto sax and is also pitched in B-falt, sounding 1 octave lower than the soprano sax). [23] X Research source The lowest and biggest common sax is the bari sax. It’s pitched in E-flat, like the alto, and sounds an octave lower. The tenor and alto saxes are the most popular and common. The tenor is known for its mellow, warm sound while the alto is a bit brighter (and favored by beginners because of its smaller size)."
