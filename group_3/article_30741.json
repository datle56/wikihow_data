      "content": "Attend a talk show taping when Jace is on. Celebrities often go on talk shows to promote new shows, movies, or books. You can buy a ticket to a talk show and be a live audience member when Jace is a guest on a show, and maybe even get a chance to meet him, or at least say hello. If you can’t afford a ticket or don’t get one in time, try standing outside of the studio when the show is being taped. Often when celebrities first arrive at the studio to film a talk show, they will spend some time talking to fans and signing autographs. [3] X Research source Some talk shows have special deals where audience members can request free tickets, or show off a funny talent to be featured on the show."

      "title": "Act normally when you meet Jace.",
      "content": "Act normally when you meet Jace. If you do end up meeting him, treat Jace like any other person, because he is a human too. Getting excited is okay, but try not to act too star-struck. Celebrities like it when fans can hold normal conversations with them. Even if you are freaking out on the inside, you can try to ask questions about his work on the shows that you like, or something interesting you saw on his social media recently. You can ask him things like, “I loved your character in Henry Danger ! What was your favorite part about playing him?” or, “What has been your favorite movie role so far?” Don’t ask questions that are too specific about Jace’s life, or you may come across as an obsessed fan."

      "title": "Ask him before taking a picture.",
      "content": "Ask him before taking a picture. If you meet Jace out and about, he might not want to take a picture with you right then, and that’s okay. Asking nicely and respectfully will up your chances of getting a photo with him, and improve your interaction overall. A simple statement like, “Hi Jace, I’m a huge fan. I was wondering if we could grab a picture together?” will be much appreciated by him, and will probably get you a photo with Jace. Taking sneaky pictures of celebrities when they are in their day-to-day lives is considered pretty rude, so you should try to approach and ask him for a picture specifically."
