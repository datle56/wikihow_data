      "content": "Set aside time to talk. It can be easy to get into bad habits or routines such as watching TV during dinner, or looking through your phone before you go to sleep.

Here are some things you can try: [2] X Research source Make evening meals a chance to discuss what you want for your future. Try turning off the TV and lighting some candles instead.

      "content": "Increase emotional intimacy. Intimacy means more than just having sex. You can increase intimacy through conversation, sharing experiences, and developing trust.

Take the time to focus on each other in ways you may have not been able to in a while. For example, you might: [3] X Research source Face each other and make eye contact when you are talking or while silent. Be silly and share laughter together.

You and your partner might be operating under the turn-ons and turn-offs from earlier in your relationship. You also might not have discussed them in a long time. Take the time now to have a romantic conversation about what lights the spark and what puts it out. Talking about it beforehand will also set the stage for being more open, talkative, and maybe even directive during sex. Here are some ways to get started: Recall the best sex you've had together and tell your partner what you liked about it. Talk about any fantasies you have or something you've always wanted to try. Talk about turn-ons and turn-offs. Try starting the conversation with, \"We haven't talked about this in a while, and I'm curious. What turns you on? Is there anything that's a big turn-off?\" If you are nervous, try taking turns listing your turn-ons and turn-offs with your partner. If you are struggling to determine what turns you on now, try and reconnect with some turn-ons from earlier in your relationship and see if they still work. [4] X Research source If you or your partner are still not sure, have a night where you both focus on just one partner and find out what your turn-ons are."
