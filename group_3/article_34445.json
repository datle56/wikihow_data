Use it as an excuse to break out your favorite decorative clips, barrettes, or bobby pins. Tuck any loose hair behind your ear or up into your hairline and clip it in place. You can also use a headband to keep your bangs out of your face. If you still have a few little flyaway strands, don’t fret. The tousled, messy look is in!"
