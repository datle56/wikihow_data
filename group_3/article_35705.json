[4] X Research source Lean protein should be included in all meals. This will help ensure you meet your daily recommended amount. Women should aim for 46 g daily and men should aim for 56 g. Lean protein sources include: poultry, lean beef, pork, legumes, tofu, low-fat dairy, and seafood. Limit or avoid sources of protein that contain higher amounts of saturated fat.

You will also want to eat plenty of fruit. It's generally recommended to consume about five to nine servings of fruits and vegetables each day. Aim for one to two servings of fruit and the rest should be vegetables. Also, when you're choosing foods from these groups, try to choose items that are brightly colored or darkly colored. These foods are typically more nutrient-dense meaning they contain higher amounts of vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants. [6] X Research source For example, choose kale over iceberg lettuce. Try using vegetables creatively. Try them raw with a dip or in a salad, sauté them on the stove, cook them in a soup, roast them in the oven, grill them outside, or hide them in a smoothie or in spaghetti sauce and serve over spaghetti squash."
