      "content": "Wash and dry your hands before preparing the bottle. To reduce the chances of getting bacteria onto the nipple or in the milk, always wash and dry your hands before you start preparing a bottle for your baby. Use soap and running water to wash your hands. Rub the soap over all surfaces of your hands and fingers for 20 seconds. Then, rinse your hands thoroughly and dry them off with a clean towel.

You can use any water that is safe for your baby to drink, such as tap water, bottled water, sterilized water, or boiled and cooled water. Check with your baby’s pediatrician if you are unsure. Consider how much your baby normally drinks in a feeding and make half that amount of formula to mix with an equal amount of breastmilk. [3] X Research source If your baby normally drinks 4 fluid ounces (120 mL) in a feeding, then you might make 2 fl oz (59 mL) of formula and combine it with 2 fl oz (59 mL) of breastmilk."

Cover the nipple with a cap or with your fingertip to prevent formula from spraying out while you shake it. Then, shake the water and powdered formula vigorously for about 10 to 15 seconds to ensure that they are well-combined.

Measure the breastmilk before you add it or use the lines on the side of the bottle to see how much you are adding. Then, place the lid back onto the bottle and shake to combine the formula and breastmilk. [6] X Research source Make sure to add an equal amount of breastmilk to the formula if you are using more than 2 fl oz (59 mL) of formula, such as 4 fl oz (120 mL) of breastmilk for 4 fl oz (120 mL) of formula."

If your baby prefers warm milk, then place the bottle into a bottle warmer or a cup of hot water for a few minutes to heat it up.

If your baby does not finish the bottle, you will need to discard whatever is left and any breastmilk you added to the formula will be wasted. [8] X Research source Never refrigerate a bottle that your baby has been drinking from! Bacteria may start to grow in the milk quickly and feeding your baby from the same bottle can make your baby sick.

[10] X Research source However, always prepare powdered formula with water, and never use breastmilk in place of the water. Mixing powdered formula with breastmilk will create a high concentration of nutrients and proteins that is dangerous for your baby. [11] X Research source Always prepare formula separately first, and then mix the prepared liquid formula with breastmilk. If the formula is pre-made, then you can mix the liquid with breastmilk as is."
