      "content": "Test the marble with water or mineral oil. Sealing your countertop is probably the best way to protect it, but before sealing it, you should make sure it needs to be sealed. Put a few drops of mineral oil or water on your counter and leave it for a few minutes (4 minutes for the water and 10 for the mineral oil). Wipe up the liquid. If a dark spot or stain is left behind, then it’s time to seal your countertop. Don’t worry about the water or mineral oil leaving a spot behind; the liquid should evaporate within a half hour."

      "content": "Apply the sealer by spraying and rubbing it in. Begin following the sealer’s directions. Typically, the sealer label will instruct you to spray the entirety of your countertop with the sealer and then rub it in with a clean, soft cloth. If you’ve never sealed you countertop before with the product you’re using, consider treating a small area and checking it 24 hours later to make sure it had a positive effect on your countertop. If your countertop has a large surface area, you may want to treat small sections one at a time."

Unless otherwise instructed, let the sealer soak in for about 5 minutes and then get a clean microfiber cloth to use to wipe up any excess. If you happened to apply the perfect amount of sealer, then there may not be any left for you to remove. If this is the case, do a quick counter wipe with the microfiber cloth anyway."

      "content": "Apply a second coat after 15 minutes. It’s common and often beneficial to do more than one coat when applying sealer, mostly because multiple coats ensure full coverage. Make sure to wait at least 15 minutes so that the first coat can completely soak in, and then apply additional coats as needed and/or specified in your sealer’s directions."

Marble is especially sensitive to acidic substances such as coffee, soda, fruit juices, and many common cleaning products. As soon as a liquid comes in contact with your counter, wipe it up with a paper towel, sponge, or soft cloth. [3] X Research source Keep a hand towel nearby to ensure quick clean up."

If your marble countertop is looking especially dirty, dull, or stained, it might be best to apply a paste-like cleaning agent, such as baking soda, to your entire countertop. Mix the paste and slather it onto the counter evenly with a spatula so that it’s ¼ to ½ inch (0.64-1.27cm) thick. Cover it with plastic wrap and tape down the edges with painter’s tape. Remove the plastic after 24-48 hours, let the paste dry out, and then remove it with a wooden or plastic scraper. [6] X Research source"
