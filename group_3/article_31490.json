      "content": "Examine your construction plans, and determine if there is any way they can be revised so that a variance is not necessary. If you can modify your plans so that they conform to the local zoning ordinances, you will save yourself the hassle of applying for a variance. In addition, you are not likely to be approved for a variance if your plans can be easily changed to comply with the zoning laws."

      "content": "Familiarize yourself with the local jurisdiction's requirements for a variance. In general, a variance will only be granted if the following 4 criteria are met: [1] X Research source Compliance with the zoning laws would cause undue hardship on the landowner; The proposed construction is necessary for reasonable use of the property; The proposed construction would not alter the essential character of the neighborhood; The proposed construction represents the least intrusive solution possible."

      "title": "Determine what type of variance you need.",
      "content": "Determine what type of variance you need. There are two basic kinds of variances: area and use. [2] X Research source An area variance is required when the configuration of the lot dictates that the zoning regulations simply be relaxed. Common examples of area variances would be exceptions for minimum setbacks from the property line and minimum floor areas. A use variance is required when the building's intended use will violate the zoning ordinances; for example, a use variance would be required to build an office building in a residential neighborhood. Use variances are much harder to obtain than area variances."

      "title": "Get your lot surveyed.",
      "content": "Get your lot surveyed. This is an essential step any time you are planning new construction or an addition. The city or town hall where you will file the variance application will want to see an updated survey, and having a proper survey done will keep you out of legal trouble with neighbors who might object to your use of the land. This is especially important when you are seeking a variance regarding minimum property setbacks."
