      "content": "Choose your pair of jeans. For women’s styles, the super skinny cuff looks best with jeans that are very form fitting, often labeled “skinny” jeans. These jeans are straight-legged jeans, and usually have a bit of stretch to the fabric. For men’s styles, the super skinny cuff works for jeans that are slim and straight-legged. These jeans can also be labeled “skinny” or “slim fit” jeans."

      "content": "Make the second fold. Fold the bottom of the jeans again to create a double cuff of the hemline. This cuff should still be relatively ½ wide. [1] X Research source Smooth out the edges of the cuff so your folds are even in size, and are uniform. For women’s styles, this cuff is chic, and looks good with both hi-rise and low-rise shoes. For men’s styles, this cuff works well with thinner, lighter fabrics, and looks good with slender shaped shoes. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Chose your pair of jeans. For women’s styles, this casual cuff looks best on looser fitting jeans. A loose, straight-legged pair of jeans would work well, but this cuff would also work on jeans labeled as “slouchy” or “boyfriend” jeans. For men’s styles, this cuff works on jeans that are looser, longer, and heavier in weight."

      "title": "Create the first fold.",
      "content": "Create the first fold. Fold the bottom of both legs of your jeans upward. For women’s styles this fold is usually about 2 inches wide. For men’s styles, this fold is generally thicker, about 3-5 inches wide. [3] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Make the second fold.",
      "content": "Make the second fold. For women’s styles, fold the 2-inch cuff again, to make a double cuff. For men’s styles, normally the one, large cuff is sufficient to create a wide cuff look. The men’s style allows you to cuff you pants again, if desired. Just be aware that the look might not be what you are aiming for, as another large cuff will be fairly high up your calf. For women’s styles, this cuff is best used for a casual look pair with sneakers. For men’s styles, this cuff works well with heavier jeans and paired with boots."

      "content": "Chose your pair of jeans. For women’s styles, the cuff works best with looser fit jeans. This could mean “boyfriend” jeans, or just roomier, straight-legged jeans. For men’s styles, the rolled cuff is a simple cuff, and one of the most adaptable looks. A simple rolled cuff works on nearly all types and weights of denim."

      "title": "Create the first fold.",
      "content": "Create the first fold. There is a bit of freedom with this cuff, but fold both bottom legs of your jeans about 1 inch. Make sure that the fold is even all the way around the circumference of the jean leg. For men’s styles, aim for a 2-inch initial fold."

      "title": "Make the second fold.",
      "content": "Make the second fold. For women’s styles, fold the bottom of your jeans again on both legs to make a doubled 1-inch cuff. This fold doesn’t have to be perfect, so don’t worry about smoothing out the cuff. About 2-4 rolls work well for this type of cuff. Consider lightly tugging and plucking at the cuff to give it a rounder, fatter look. For men’s styles, make your second fold by folding in the hem of your jeans into your initial fold. This fold should completely hide your jeans’ hemline on the inside of the first cuff. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Choose your jeans. The under cuff is usually fashioned with women’s jeans that are tighter fitting, and contain lycra woven into the fabric. [5] X Research source This is because the lycra gives the jeans some flexibility, which helps to maintain the creasing in the cuff."

    {
      "title": "Make your first fold.",
      "content": "Make your first fold. Fold the bottom of both legs of your jeans 1-3 inches thick. The width of the fold is really all about the desired length of your jeans. Make a larger fold if you want your jeans shorter, and make a smaller fold if you want your jeans longer."

      "title": "Iron the fold.",
      "content": "Iron the fold. Iron the bottom edge of the fold to give your jeans a firm creasing. [6] X Research source Make sure to iron both the front and back sides of the cuff."

      "title": "Fold the cuff under.",
      "content": "Fold the cuff under. Instead of folding the cuff again, on the outside of the jeans, turn the cuff inward, folding into the inside of the jeans. The ironed crease should serve as the bottom marker of the cuff. Pull on the edges of the cuff to make sure the fold is even and flat. This cuff works best for seamlessly altering the length of jeans, in order to pair them with a pair of heels. However, in general, this cuff can be worn with any kind of shoe."

These loose but heavier jeans are then usually paired with high fashion items like heels and leather jackets, to create a juxtaposed look of both sloppy and chic."

      "content": "Make the first fold. Fold both bottom legs of your jeans up about 3-4 inches. Then, pluck and pull the cuffing downward to create a sloppier look. The cuff should look crinkly and wrinkled."
