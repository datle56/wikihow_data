      "title": "Yes, you deserve to share your feelings—and a Pisces will be empathetic.",
      "content": "Yes, you deserve to share your feelings—and a Pisces will be empathetic. When you develop feelings for someone, telling your crush can be scary. But love always takes a little risk, and you may end up being rewarded for your bravery. Get your Pisces alone, share your message , and be honest with him. Maybe he'll feel the same. Then suddenly, you're getting romantic with a dreamy, kind, super sweet Pisces."

    {
      "title": "\"I want to be honest with you—I like you.\"",
      "content": "\"I want to be honest with you—I like you.\" Be straightforward, open, and authentic when sharing feelings with Pisces. Ruled by Neptune, Pisces is empathetic—so he won't freak out if you share your genuine emotions. [1] X Research source Instead of being coy or playing it cool, let your true feelings fly. Whether or not he reciprocates, he’ll appreciate that you were in touch and upfront with your own emotions. Describe how he makes you feel: “I always feel my best when I’m around you.” Tell him what you appreciate about him: “You’re such a caring person, and I really admire that.” And explain the level of your feelings: “This is really big for me. I don’t usually form crushes like this, but I’m really into you.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "\"I like you exactly as you are.\"",
      "content": "\"I like you exactly as you are.\" Pisces men are terrified of feeling limited or controlled in love. So, make it clear that you don’t plan to do either of those things—instead, you just want to appreciate him for who he is . Explain that you’ll accept his feelings and if he is interested in you, you’re committed to accepting him for him . “I just want to say that no matter what, I’ll accept how you feel. I may need time, but I won’t be mad if you don’t feel the same way I do.” \"I'm not into the person you could be. I like you for exactly who you are right now.\" “To me, you're perfect. I wouldn’t dream of trying to change you.”"

      "title": "\"I want to be the person who's there for you when you're feeling down.\"",
      "content": "\"I want to be the person who's there for you when you're feeling down.\" In love, Pisces is looking for someone to help him process his ever-changing, intense emotions. When you tell him how you feel, explain that you’d like to be his rock and confidant. Tell him that because you care about him, you’d like to care for him—and that means supporting him emotionally. “I really want to make you feel cared for.” “I just want to make you happy.\" \"I know you go through a lot. I want to help you process all of your big emotions.\""
    },
    {
      "title": "\"I do really like you, but I would never want you to feel uncomfortable.\"",
      "content": "\"I do really like you, but I would never want you to feel uncomfortable.\" Be gentle with Pisces, because these men are extremely sensitive. When you explain how you feel, he’ll be a great listener—unless you unintentionally make him feel attacked or confronted. Speak softly, remind him that your feelings are your own (and he’s not responsible for them!), and at all costs, avoid hurting his feelings. Sometimes, when we care a lot about someone, it can actually make us resent them, especially if we feel a little led on. When sharing your feelings with a Pisces man, keep these feelings in check. Say, “You made me fall for you. This is your fault!” and he’ll shut down. Instead, remind him that because you care about him, you’ve got great intentions: “I like you, but I don’t blame you or expect anything in return.”"

      "title": "\"Do you feel the same?\"",
      "content": "\"Do you feel the same?\" Ask your Pisces if the crush goes both ways. If he says yes, then that's amazing news! Your bravery paid off, and you should definitely ask him on a date (bonus points for something creative, like a poetry reading!). If he doesn't feel the same, don't stress. Pisces will be super respectful about your feelings. Take a deep breath and explain that you'll need time to think. First, ask him how he feels: \"Now you know that I'm into you. But are you into me, too?\" Then, if he's interested, ask him out: \"Wow, amazing. I'd love to keep getting to know you. Would you want to come to this art gallery opening with me?\" If he's not, you'll need to take some time to decide how you want to proceed. Explain this to him: \"Okay, thanks for your honesty. I need to do some reflection before I reach back out.\""

    {
      "title": "\"For us to move forward, I think I need to set boundaries with you.\"",
      "content": "\"For us to move forward, I think I need to set boundaries with you.\" Depending on how your conversation goes, you may want to stay friends, become partners, or take some time away. It’s possible that with this free-spirited water sign, you’ll need to protect your own needs , because Pisces men may struggle to set and follow rules. Reflect on what you want, communicate that to him, and then enforce your boundaries. “Hey, I’m so glad I shared my feelings with you, but now I need to take some time away to regroup.” “I’ll need you to respect that. So please, don’t call or text me at all this week. I’ll reach out when I’m ready.” If necessary, enforce the boundaries you’ve set: “I asked you not to reach out, remember? I really need you to listen.”"
