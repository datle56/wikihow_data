      "content": "Build the name. For a two element ionic compound, the naming is simple. The first part of the name is the name of the metal element. The second part is the name of the nonmetal element, with the suffix “-ide.” Here are some examples: Al 2 O 3 . Al 2 = Aluminium; O 3 = Oxygen. So the name would be “aluminium oxide.” FeCl 3 . Fe = Iron; Cl 3 = Chlorine. So the name would be \"iron chloride.\" SnO 2 . Sn = Tin; O 2 = Oxygen. So the name of this compound would be Tin Oxide."

      "content": "Recognize and name transition metals. Metals in the D and F blocks of the periodic table are known as transition metals. Their charge is written with a Roman numeral when writing out the compound name. This is because they can have more than one charge and make more than one compound. Example: FeCl 2 and FeCl 3 . Fe = Iron; Cl 2 = Chloride -2; Cl 3 = Chloride -3. The names would be iron(II) chloride and iron(III) chloride."

      "content": "Understand what a polyatomic compound is. These compounds are built off of groups of atoms that are covalently bonded together, and the entire group has a positive or negative charge. [1] X Research source You can do three basic things to polyatomic compounds, which will help you identify and understand these types of compounds: Add a hydrogen to the beginning of the compound. The word “hydrogen” is added to the beginning of the compound name. This reduces the negative charge by one. For example, “carbonate” CO 3 2- becomes “hydrogen carbonate” HCO 3 - . Remove an oxygen from the compound. The charge stays the same and the ending of the compound changes from “-ate” to “–ite”. For example: NO 3 to NO 2 goes from “nitrate” to “nitrite.” Replace the central atom with another from the same periodic group. For example, sulfate SO 4 2- can become Selenate SeO 4 2- ."

If the element comes in front of the ion group, the name of the element is simply added to the beginning of the compound name. [3] X Research source Example: KMnO 4 . You should recognize the MnO 4 - ion as permanganate. K is potassium, so the compound is named potassium permanganate. Example: NaOH. You should recognize the OH - ion as hydroxide. Na is sodium, so the compound is named sodium hydroxide."

[6] X Research source Example: CO would be carbon monoxide and CO 2 would be carbon dioxide. Example: N 2 S 3 would be Dinitrogen trisulfide. In most cases, the “mono-“ prefix can be omitted, because it is implied when it is not present. It is still used for carbon monoxide due to the term being in use since early chemistry."
