      "content": "Rip away the velcro straps securing the Pack ‘n Play to remove the pad. Lay the compact Pack ‘n Play down on its side so that the wheels are at the bottom. To open up the equipment, tear away the velcro straps along that are holding the Pack ‘n Play in place. As you do this, keep in mind that the straps may be secured in opposite directions. Once you’ve removed and separated the soft pad from the rest of the Pack ‘n Play, set it aside for later. When it’s packed up, the Pack ‘n Play resembles a folding chair."

      "content": "Pull all 4 legs apart from the center to set up the crib. Set your hands on the center of each plastic bar and extend them until they click twice into place. To make the assembly process easier, grab and push on the bars that are opposite of one another. Make sure that all 4 bars click twice before continuing with the set-up."

      "title": "Press down on the center of the crib to secure it in place.",
      "content": "Press down on the center of the crib to secure it in place. Look for the red tab in the center of the crib, and push it down to flatten out the bottom of the crib. Listen for a double clicking sound to confirm that the bottom of the Pack ‘n Play is secure. If you’re having trouble locating the tab, look at the manufacturer’s instructions to double check where it is. At this point, your Pack ‘n Play should be resembling a portable crib."

      "title": "Lay and tuck the pad into the bottom of the Pack ‘n Play with velcro.",
      "content": "Lay and tuck the pad into the bottom of the Pack ‘n Play with velcro. Take the soft pad that you set aside earlier and fit it snugly into the bottom of the equipment. Pull the velcro tabs through the accompanying slots at the bottom of the Pack ‘n Play. Finally, secure the tabs to the fasteners beneath the equipment. Once the pad is in place, you’re ready to go!"

      "title": "Tug on the tab in the center of the crib to start disassembling.",
      "content": "Tug on the tab in the center of the crib to start disassembling. Detach the velcro tabs and remove the pad to find the red tab dangling from the center of Pack ‘n Play. Pull on this to bring the crib upwards, and to start bringing the 4 corners of the equipment together. At this point, switch your focus to the plastic bars that make up the edge of the Pack ‘n Play. As you put away the Pack ‘n Play, try to reverse the assembly process."

      "title": "Push on the 2 buttons opposite of each other on the longer bars.",
      "content": "Push on the 2 buttons opposite of each other on the longer bars. Find the 2 buttons on the outside of the longest, horizontal bars and press them simultaneously. At this point, make sure that the 2 longer, parallel bars are bending and folding upwards. Picture the top of the Pack ‘n Play like a rectangle. When you disassemble the equipment, be sure to fold up to 2 longer sides first."

    {
      "title": "Press both buttons on the shorter bars simultaneously.",
      "content": "Press both buttons on the shorter bars simultaneously. As you did with longer bars, find the buttons on the outside of the 2 shorter bars and press them into place at the same time. Watch and make sure that the shorter bars are bending and folding as well. During this process, make sure that the longer bars don’t re-lock into place. If the equipment locks again, you’ll have to start the disassembly process over from the beginning."

    {
      "title": "Condense the bars and place the compact crib back in its carrier.",
      "content": "Condense the bars and place the compact crib back in its carrier. Pull the bars all the way up so that the Pack ‘n Play is completely disassembled. Once these bars are up, slide the equipment back into the carrying case it came in. If necessary, re-velcro any straps on the outside of the case. If your Pack ‘n Play originally had the pad wrapped around the outside of the equipment, be sure to re-wrap it at this point."
