      "title": "Identify the problem or conflict that has been brought to your attention.",
      "content": "Identify the problem or conflict that has been brought to your attention. Remove any preconceptions about the subject that automatically pop into your head. For example, if the problem has to do with someone else, release the automatic thought that it is the other individual’s problem and has nothing to do with you."

      "title": "Take full responsibility for this problem or conflict being in your reality.",
      "content": "Take full responsibility for this problem or conflict being in your reality. Assume that everything in your world is a product of past thoughts and deeds, and the memories attached to those deeds bring the resulting problem. ‘If we can accept that we are the sum total of our past thoughts, emotions, words, deeds and actions and that our present lives and choices are colored or shaded by this memory bank of the past, then we begin to see how a process of correcting or setting aright can change our lives, our families and our society.’—Morrnah Nalamaku Simeona"

      "title": "Ask that errors in our thoughts, words, actions and deeds be cleaned.",
      "content": "Ask that errors in our thoughts, words, actions and deeds be cleaned. This is accomplished through a simple mantra, or prayer to Divinity/God/Love. Use the four-part prayer to ask for forgiveness. I love you. I am sorry. Please forgive me. Thank you."

      "title": "Trust that changes have occurred on a Divine level and that any corrections made within are corrected for all those involved.",
      "content": "Trust that changes have occurred on a Divine level and that any corrections made within are corrected for all those involved. This involves the acknowledgement that we are all a part of a greater “whole”, that is, we are all connected on a higher level and there is no need to analyze, figure out, solve, manage, cope with, or control problems. All that is needed is to go directly to the Creator and ask that the error/thought/memory be corrected and cleaned. Only Divinity can do this. Divinity/Creator/Love knows us and what memory is replaying. This is merely an exercise in letting go; there is no need to invite conflict with one’s religious beliefs or non-beliefs."
