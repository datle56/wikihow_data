      "content": "A pillow princess refers to someone who prefers to receive sexual touch, but not give it. They might reciprocate some sexual acts, but not all, or they may prefer not to give sexual pleasure at all. At least, they may not give it in the transactional, heteronormative sense: pillow princesses may offer sexual pleasure in nontraditional ways, like through nonsexual touching or kissing or limiting physical touch entirely. [1] X Research source Pillow princesses often gravitate to “stone butches,” “stone tops,” or “touch me nots,” who often receive sexual pleasure from providing pleasure , and not getting it directly. Pillow princesses are also sometimes called “stone femmes” or “high femmes.” Sexual pleasure is a spectrum, and some pillow princesses may prefer some touch or only certain types of touch and may reciprocate some touch or none; similarly, some stone butches may prefer no touch at all, only some touch, or only certain types of touch, and may give as much or as little as they prefer. Though the term is often used in lesbian circles, it’s expanded to refer to all genders. “Pillow prince” is sometimes used as a masculine form. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "The term probably stems from 1990s LGBTQ media. In 1992, the lesbian magazine Deneuve described a relationship dynamic “where the butch would initiate and give sexual pleasure while the femme would play ‘pillow princess’ and receive.” “Princess” had been a slang term for a lesbian or gay person since the 1960s, and “pillow” in front of it implies passivity.

      "title": "No! It’s a totally valid sexual identity.",
      "content": "No! It’s a totally valid sexual identity. Though the term “pillow princess” has been used derogatorily to refer to someone who is too “lazy” or “selfish” to please their partner, a pillow princess is a legitimate sexual identity. Pillow princesses are also very desirable sexual partners to people who may prefer only to provide pleasure and who may not want to be touched. [4] X Research source The stigma against pillow princesses may come from a view of sex as transactional rather than experiential. Pillow princesses (and stone butches, for that matter) operate under the understanding that there are different ways to give and receive sexual pleasure, and that what’s enjoyable to you may not be enjoyable to someone else."

      "content": "Some people consider it a pejorative, so check in before you use it. While many people, especially in the LGBTQ community, consider \"pillow princess\" a neutral term for a valid sexual identity, others (including in LGBTQ circles) may view it as insulting only. So even if you consider it appropriate, be sure to check in with someone before calling them a pillow princess! [5] X Research source"

      "content": "You may know inherently, or it may take some exploration. There’s no “right” or “wrong” sexual identity , and no “right” or “wrong” way to figure it out (as long as it’s consensual, of course!). Sexuality is often fluid and yours may change over time. Just be open to new experiences—but also respect your personal boundaries, and practice communicating them with your partner(s) to ensure everyone’s on the same page. [6] X Research source Rather than think about what you may identify as, think about your sexual fantasies: what do they look like? Who's there, and what are you (and they) doing? What do you need to feel sexually aroused, to get off, and to feel empowered and have agency in the bedroom? Asking these questions and considering them without judgment will help you figure out what sort of sexual experience you want to have and what your sexual identity might be. You may claim and reject different labels over the course of your life, and that's totally OK!"
