      "title": "Heat the candies on LOW for 30 seconds and stir them.",
      "content": "Heat the candies on LOW for 30 seconds and stir them. If your microwave allows it, adjust the heat settings to the lowest option. Place the bowl in the microwave and heat the candy for 30 seconds. Then, open the door and stir the mixture a few times with a spoon. [3] X Research source Stirring the candies helps distribute the heat throughout the mixture."

      "content": "Crush your peppermint candies into small pieces with a rolling pin. Unwrap and arrange all your candies on a flat surface, like a cutting board. Grab a rolling pin and carefully break the mints into small pieces. Crushing the candy makes it easier to melt down. For easier cleanup, put the mints in a plastic baggie and seal it before crushing them."

      "title": "Transfer the crushed peppermints to a saucepan or double boiler.",
      "content": "Transfer the crushed peppermints to a saucepan or double boiler. If you’re using a saucepan, stir in 1 US tbsp (15 mL) of corn syrup for every 15-18 candies you plan on melting. If you’re using a double boiler, dump the candies into the top pan without any extra corn syrup."

      "content": "Stir the peppermints as they melt. Continue stirring the candies as they begin to melt. This prevents the peppermints from overheating and scorching."

      "content": "Remove the pan from the heat when the candy melts down to a liquid. Keep an eye on the melted candies. Once you’re happy with the consistency of the liquid, turn off the stovetop and move your saucepan or double boiler off the burner. Use the melted peppermint right away, so it doesn’t re-harden."

      "content": "Preheat your oven to 350 °F (177 °C) and line a baking sheet. You won’t be melting the candies down into a liquid, so the oven doesn’t need to be super hot for this. [5] X Research source In the meantime, place a sheet of parchment paper on top of a baking sheet, which helps protect the cooking tray from future messes as the candies melt in the oven.

Pick out some of your favorite cookie cutter shapes, whether they’re Christmas trees, stars, angels, or other festive shapes. Double-check that they’re made with metal—other materials, like plastic, will melt in the oven. Spray each cutter with non-stick cooking spray, and set them on the lined baking sheet. [7] X Research source You can find cookie cutters at most home goods stores, or at online shops."

If needed, break the candies into smaller pieces so they fit more smoothly in the cutter. [8] X Research source Use the same types of peppermints in each cookie cutter. Different candy brands might melt down more quickly or slowly than others."

Tap on the surface to see if they’re cool to the touch—if so, lift up the cookie cutters and push the ornaments out. Then, string a ribbon through the hole along the top of each ornament and hang them up! [12] X Research source"
