You might include things that you’ve seen done at other funerals that you thought worked well. [1] X Research source As you are sketching out ideas, pay attention to the intangibles as well. For example, what kinds of emotions do you want your funeral to create in others? Do you want your funeral to feel like a celebration or be a bit more somber in tone?"

      "content": "Decide on a type of funeral. You will need to choose between a burial or cremation. With a burial, your body is interred in the ground either with or without embalming. With cremation, your body is cremated to ash and the remains are placed in a container of your choice.

      "content": "Decide on a reception style. It is your choice whether to have a gathering before or after your funeral or none at all. You can have a service in the funeral home or a graveyard service at the cemetery. You can have a body viewing or wake before your funeral as well. This decision should be based, at least in part, on how comfortable you are with others viewing your body after death. You can always opt for a closed casket service as well. You might also choose to have a memorial service, which is a service where your body will not be present. [4] X Expert Source David I. Jacobson Funeral Home Director Expert Interview. 14 July 2020."

Ask friends and relatives who have attended funerals if they have any recommendations. All funeral providers are required to provide you with a price list upon request. [5] X Trustworthy Source Federal Trade Commission Website with up-to-date information for consumers from the Federal Trade Commisson Go to source It is sometimes hard to differentiate between a locally-owned home and a franchise or corporation. Make sure to ask about the funeral home’s history as you do research. You will also want to decide if you’d like to use one facility for the entire reception and funeral process or if you would like to only purchase part of a funeral package, a direct burial without a reception for example. Many people choose to have their funeral receptions held at a church or even at their home."

      "content": "Decide if you want a religious element. If you plan to follow religious conventions, you’ll want to reach out to your minister, priest, or rabbi to discuss the details. Some religious leaders charge fees for their services and you’ll want to ask about these now. You may also want to discuss using the church facility for part of the reception as well. Consider choosing a funeral home that specializes in funerals for people of your faith. [6] X Expert Source David I. Jacobson Funeral Home Director Expert Interview. 14 July 2020."

It is not required to have eulogists and, if you choose to include speakers in your funeral, you will want to carefully select people who know you well.

Do you want music at the graveside or just at the church reception afterwards? Be aware that you can also opt for a combination of live and recorded music as well. Make notes regarding your wishes and discuss them with the funeral director."

Consider keeping a file on your computer containing possible memorial images to be used solely or as part of a general video during your funeral. You can also put these images on a zip drive and give it to a relative. With technology now you can get even more creative if you like and request that your tweets or blog entries are also incorporated in your funeral. They could be added on to the program or projected alongside photos of you. It is also a good idea to put a close friend in charge of alerting the online community (Facebook, Twitter) regarding your passing. You can script a message for them to send along or leave it up to them. [9] X Research source"

And, regardless of whether you choose cremation or burial, your funeral home will likely add a set of standard fees onto your final bill. These fees can include the cost of obtaining death certificates or even housing your body. Keeping in mind how much you can reasonably spend will help you to make realistic choices.

Many people like the idea of having their ashes scattered but you will want to leave very specific instructions behind discussing how to go about it. You will want to receive advance permission to have your ashes scattered on private or government-owned property. You will also want to make sure that this is your final choice as it is irrevocable once completed. [21] X Research source Some cemeteries set aside a particular area where mourners can scatter ashes as they so choose. Ask the funeral directors that you meet with if they provide such a service. Note that if you decide to scatter ashes in the ocean you must be a minimum of three nautical miles offshore.

These letters can be designed to be opened right after your death, as opposed to the weeks it may take to process your will and related effects. Be honest and sincere in these letters and use them as an opportunity to say an extended good-bye. It is a good idea to update these letters every so often.

[22] X Research source Avoid putting your only plan copy into a safe deposit box as it could be difficult for your family members to access it quickly.
