Every professional cleaning service varies somewhat, but you’ll probably want to clean the counter-tops, windows, and floors. However, you shouldn’t be expected to, for instance, file the papers your client has strewn across their desk or disassemble their child’s toy train tracks. Scrubbing toilets and tubs is also typically included in a basic house-cleaning service. After your client signs the service contract, remind them to pick up their possessions a bit before you arrive. This way, you’ll be able to clean more efficiently."
