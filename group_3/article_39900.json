      "content": "Pick and wash the cucumbers using warm water. When selecting cucumbers, always choose firm darker colored cucumbers with no wrinkles or spongy spots. Some cucumbers at the store are waxed to prevent them from spoiling when they are out of season. The skins contain vitamin A, so try to buy unwaxed cucumbers, whose skin you can eat. Run unwaxed cucumbers under cold water and lightly scrub them. If you have purchased waxed cucumbers, make sure to peel them and discard the skin."

This will leave you with thin rectangular cuts. Begin each cut with the knife handle up and the tip down into the cucumber. Push the blade forward as you push it down to create your cuts. Your hand position should allow the side of the knife blade to gently rest against the knuckles of your other hand as you hold the cucumber. Making this cut with confidence takes practice. If you are nervous, grip your cucumber further back from your knife blade."

      "content": "Spiral cut your cucumbers. Use a sharp knife or vegetable peeler (recommended if you don't have experience in spiral cutting cucumbers) and begin peeling at one side in a circular motion. You should be creating a very thin peel. Continue until you have reached the end of your cucumber. Be careful with the knife or vegetable peeler, always cut away from your hands and fingers. Try to keep the shaving intact, but it's okay if it breaks off too. If you'd like, you can use a knife or apple corer to take the seeds out before you begin peeling. Spiral cut cucumbers are a fun way to garnish a salad. You can even dress spiral cut cucumbers with a light dressing and a little bit of pepper for a creative salad. Put spiral cut cucumbers on a sandwich or burger for a twist."
