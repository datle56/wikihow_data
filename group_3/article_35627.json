      "content": "Ask your doctor for medication recommendations. Medical treatment for GERD is broken down according to severity of symptoms. Many medications are available over-the-counter (OTC). You should still consult your doctor to ensure a proper treatment regimen. If he or she can write you a prescription for an OTC medication, you might even be able to get it covered by insurance. Follow the dosage and timing instructions carefully for each different drug to prevent potentially severe side effects. [2] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source For mild to moderate GERD: Take antacids as needed (Tums, Maalox) to neutralize acid if your symptoms occur once weekly or less. They provide relief within minutes, but only last for a few hours. [3] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source Take surface agents (sucralfate/Carafate) to protect esophageal and stomach lining and promote healing. [4] X Research source Take histamine 2 receptor antagonists (Zantac, Pepcid) to decrease acid secretion. [5] X Research source For severe or frequent (2 or more episodes per week) GERD: take proton pump inhibitors (omeprazole, lansoprazole, esomeprazole, pantoprazole, dexlansoprazole, rabeprazole) to prevent acid secretion in the stomach. Some of these are available OTC, and the standard dose is one pill daily for 8 weeks. Side effects include: bacterial infections and diarrhea, anemia and osteoporosis, and interactions with other medications.

One surgical approach (fundoplication) wraps the upper part of the stomach around the esophagus, then sews it in place to reinforce the esophageal opening. [8] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source A second approach wraps a string of magnetized beads around the point where the esophagus meets the stomach. This closes the lower esophagus, but lets it expand when swallowing so food can get through.

[21] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source For an accurate number, talk to your primary care physician or a qualified nutritionist. The healthiest rate to lose weight is at about one pound per week. A pound of fat is about 3500 calories, so decrease your daily intake by 500 calories. (500 calories x 7 days/week = 3500 calories/7 days = 1 lb/week). However, keep in mind that eating less than 1,200 calories per day may prevent you from getting necessary nutrients and staying healthy.

Large, poorly chewed bites will add to how much time it takes for your stomach to break down food. You'll over-eat as a result. Eating quickly can also make you swallow too much air, which can lead to bloating. [22] X Research source It can take up to 20 minutes for your stomach to signal your brain that you are full.
