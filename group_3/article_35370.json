      "content": "Determine if you are experiencing acute fatigue with no explainable cause. Fatigue can be the sign of many different illnesses, but it's a symptom experienced by many people with HIV. [2] X Research source Dale Prokupek, MD. Internist. Personal interview. 16 April 2020. This symptom shouldn't cause great alarm if it's the only one you're feeling, but it's something to look into further. [3] X Research source Acute fatigue isn't the same as simply feeling sleepy. Do you feel tired all the time, even after a good night's sleep? Do you find yourself taking more afternoon naps than usual, and avoiding strenuous activities because you feel low energy? This type of fatigue is cause for concern. If this symptom persists over a few weeks or months, be sure to get tested to rule out HIV."

These symptoms commonly occur during the early stages of an HIV infection, during what is called the primary or acute HIV infection stage. Again, many people don't have these symptoms, but those who do usually experience them 2-4 weeks after contracting HIV. [5] X Research source Fever and night sweats are also symptoms of the flu and the common cold. If it's flu or cold season, that might be what you're experiencing. Chills , muscle aches, sore throat , and headache, which are also symptoms of the flu and cold, can also be signs of an early HIV infection."

      "content": "Check for swollen glands in the neck, armpits, or groin. The lymph nodes swell in reaction to bodily infections. This doesn't happen to everyone who has primary HIV, but among those who have symptoms, it's a common one. [6] X Research source The lymph nodes in the neck tend to swell more than those in the armpits or groin with an HIV infection. Lymph nodes can swell as a result of many other types of infections, such as a cold or the flu, so further investigation is necessary to determine the cause."

      "content": "Pay attention to mouth and genital ulcers. If you see a mouth ulcer appear along with the other symptoms noted, especially if you don't commonly get mouth ulcers, it may be a sign of primary HIV infection. Genital ulcers are also an indication that HIV may be present."

      "content": "Don't dismiss a dry cough . This symptom occurs in the later stages of HIV, sometimes many years after the virus has been contracted and been latent in the body. This seemingly innocuous symptom is easy to ignore at first, especially if it occurs during allergy season or during cough and cold season. If you have a dry cough you just can't seem to kick by taking allergy medications or using an inhaler , it may be a symptom of HIV. [7] X Research source"

[8] X Research source Dale Prokupek, MD. Internist. Personal interview. 16 April 2020. These can also be present on the inside of the mouth and nose. It's a sign that the HIV is developing into AIDS. Flaky, red skin is also a sign of later stage HIV. The spots may also look like boils or bumps. A skin rash usually doesn't accompany the flu or a cold, so if you have one at the same time as other symptoms, see a doctor right away."

You've shared needles or syringes. You've been diagnosed or treated for a sexually transmitted disease (STD), tuberculosis , or hepatitis.

Contact a local health clinic, the Red Cross, your doctor's office, or another local resource to find out where to get tested. [15] X Research source Go to the website aids.gov for a listing of testing locations. Testing is easy, affordable, and reliable (in the majority of cases). The most common test is done through drawing a blood sample. There are also tests that use oral fluids (collected with a swab) or urine. There are even tests you can take at home. If you do not have a regular physician who can provide testing, contact your local Health Department. If you are tested for HIV, do not let fear prevent you from obtaining your test results. Knowing whether or not you are infected will give you the best chance to treat your condition, or to change your lifestyle to prevent an infection. Many health organizations recommend getting tested as part of your routine physical, even if you donâ€™t think you are at risk. Catching and treating HIV early can help prevent later complications."
