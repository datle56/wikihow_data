      "content": "Unscrew the brackets on the top of your doors to loosen them. Go inside your closet and look at the top and bottom of the doors to check for brackets. Use the Philips or flathead screwdriver to loosen each screw on the brackets at the top of your doors. Do not remove the screws all the way. [1] X Research source Most sliding closet doors only have brackets at the top. The bottom is usually just a wheel that follows along a track. Loosen every single screw to ensure that you don’t miss one and crack your door when you try to remove it. Only loosen the brackets on the bottom if the door won’t raise up after loosening the brackets on top."

      "title": "If the door has brackets that lock it to the bottom track, remove them.",
      "content": "If the door has brackets that lock it to the bottom track, remove them. According to home improvement specialist Ryaan Tuttle, the bottom of the door may have plastic doorstops or guides to keep the door from swinging out. These are usually made out of plastic and attached directly to the floor. Tuttle suggests removing the doorstops before trying to lift the door. Just unscrew the screws attaching the doorstops to the floor to and slide them off the door and out of the way. If you don’t see any brackets connecting the frame to the track, it probably has wheels, and you don’t need to remove anything. Most rolling closet doors have wheels. It’s usually closet doors with glass that have the extra brackets you must remove. Repeat this process for both doors to loosen all the necessary brackets and screws. If there are brackets connecting the door to the track, they are usually on the side of the door where it sits in the track’s groove."

      "title": "Face your closet from the outside and lift the front door off the ground.",
      "content": "Face your closet from the outside and lift the front door off the ground. Hold the sides of the front door with each of your hands by wrapping around the sides in the middle of the door. Grip the door firmly and raise it as high as you can into the top track. [2] X Research source Hold the door steady as you’re raising it up. If you have a massive, walk-in closet, you can probably get away with removing them from the inside of the closet if you prefer. However, you may need more room, so go to the other side of the doors so you’re facing the closet from the room it’s in. [3] X Research source Move all the screws and tools off of the floor to avoid stepping on them while lifting the door."

      "content": "Pull the bottom of the door towards you 4–8 in (10–20 cm) and set it on the floor. Once it reaches the floor, check the bottom track to make sure the door is completely off. [4] X Research source Double-check for hidden brackets or screws if you can’t get the door off the track. On some sliding doors, the brackets are only used to adjust the height of the door, and the wheels are just hanging on the track."

[5] X Research source You may notice that the top of the door simply pops out before you have a chance to unscrew the brackets. If this happens, don’t worry about unscrewing the brackets."

      "content": "Repeat this process for the second sliding door. With your first door completely removed, lift the second door. Pull the bottom 4–8 in (10–20 cm) in your direction and then rest the door on the floor. Fully remove the screws on the top brackets and then slide it out of the slot to set it down. [6] X Research source You may need to raise the second door a little higher than the first one when raising it up if there’s a raised threshold in between the 2 doors. Clean the doors with a damp cloth and store them in a secure place that’s dry and not exposed to extreme temperatures so you can reinstall them later."

Use a Philips or flathead screwdriver to fully remove all of the screws inside the tracks. The tracks may stick a little after removing the screws, but they should come right off with a light pull.

Run the blade all the way around the trim to free the caulk from the wall. Make sure to cut all the way through the caulk. Once you’ve cut through the caulk all the way around the door, slide the edge of a pry bar under the edge of the trim near a nail. [8] X Research source Apply even pressure to lift the trim as you gently work your way around the door. Use a piece of scrap wood behind the pry bar to protect the wall. Once you get all the trim off, make sure you remove any nails from the trim and the wall and scrape off any remaining caulk or adhesive with a utility knife. If you’re planning to upgrade the look of your closet, consider replacing your door trim ."

[11] X Research source If you don’t have a putty knife, an expired credit card or an old gift card will work to spackle the hole in a pinch. Apply firm pressure when you’re applying the spackle and make sure to keep the putty knife’s edge flush with the wall."

A smooth surface also makes the patched hole undetectable under paint. [12] X Research source Sand in a circular motion to gradually blend the edges. After you’re finished sanding, run your hand over the patched area to check for bumps or depressions. If you find any, apply another layer of spackle."

When painting the wall , feather the edges to blend with the surrounding area. Allow the first layer to dry for 4-5 hours before adding the second layer."
