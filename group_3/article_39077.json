      "content": "Measure the width of the armrest and add 1 inch (2.5 cm). Take a measuring tape or ruler and hold it horizontally across the widest part of the armrest. Add 1 inch (2.5 cm) to this measurement and write it down so you know how wide to cut the front cover piece. [1] X Research source For example, if your armrest is 8 inches (20 cm) across, add 1 inch (2.5 cm) for the seam allowance to get 9 inches (23 cm)."

      "title": "Mark the length of the armrest cover.",
      "content": "Mark the length of the armrest cover. Turn your ruler or measuring tape vertically against the armrest and decide how far down you want the cover to go. To help you visualize the endpoint, mark the armrest with chalk. Then, write down your measurement. [2] X Research source It's completely up to you to determine how long to make your armrest covers. In general, they usually cover the curve of the armrest and extend down by at least a few inches. For example, to make the armrest come halfway down your sofa, your measurement might be 12 inches (30 cm) long."

      "title": "Cut a piece of fabric to match your measurements.",
      "content": "Cut a piece of fabric to match your measurements. Get out a heavy piece of fabric that's the same as the sofa fabric. Then, cut a piece that's the size as the measurements you took. Keep in mind that you don't need to cut it perfectly smooth since you'll be trimming the piece some more. [3] X Research source If your measurements were 9 by 12 inches (23 cm × 30 cm), cut the fabric to that size. If you can't find fabric that matches your sofa, choose fabric with a pattern or color that compliments your sofa. Select material that's the same weight and texture as your sofa's fabric."

      "title": "Trim the front piece to the exact shape of your armrest.",
      "content": "Trim the front piece to the exact shape of your armrest. Hold the fabric piece up to the front of the armrest and line up the top of the piece with the top of the armrest. Take a piece of chalk and mark the edges of the armrest's front. Then, cut 1 inch (2.5 cm) away from your marking line to allow for the seam. [4] X Research source Make a mark at the top of the fabric in the center so you know where to line up the finished piece later. Remember to do this on the wrong side of the fabric. If it's tricky to mark the fabric without it moving around, insert pins through the fabric into the armrest to keep it from slipping."

      "content": "Drape a large piece of fabric over the top of the armrest. Cut out a piece of matching fabric so it's large enough to completely cover the armrest and hang over both sides. Line up the edge of the fabric piece with the end of the armrest. If you don't want it to slide around while you measure, stick a few pins through the fabric and into the sofa. [5] X Research source If your sofa has a pattern, line up the fabric piece so it matches the direction of the sofa's pattern."

Do this on the wrong side of the fabric so you can line it up later before sewing. Then, use your measurement for the length of the front piece to make a mark on each side of the cover with chalk.

      "content": "Cut out the fabric and leave an extra 1 ⁄ 2 in (1.3 cm) of fabric for the seam allowance. Spread the fabric flat on a work surface and use chalk to draw a straight line on each of the long sides to mark the bottom edges of the cover. Then, cut along both lines and trim the end of the armrest where you want it to meet the back of the sofa. Remember to leave 1 ⁄ 2 inch (1.3 cm) for the seam allowance. [7] X Research source The shape of your top fabric piece depends on the style of your sofa. Curved armrests usually take more fabric than square or boxy armrests."

      "title": "Pin the top of the front piece to the edge of the top piece.",
      "content": "Pin the top of the front piece to the edge of the top piece. Lay the top piece of the cover flat so the wrong side faces up and find the mark you made near the center of its edge. Then, lay the front piece on top so the mark you made on the center edge lines up with the mark on the top piece. Stick a pin through the edge of the pieces to keep them in place. [8] X Research source The right sides of the fabric should be facing each other so you can turn them out once you finish sewing. Although you can try to around the sides of the front piece, this is tricky to do since you'll be easing the fabric around the curve."

      "title": "Use a sewing machine to stitch 1 side of the front piece to the top piece.",
      "content": "Use a sewing machine to stitch 1 side of the front piece to the top piece. Adjust your sewing machine to make straight stitches and begin sewing the front piece to the top. Start in the center edge where the marks line up and sew around the curve down to the bottom edge. Leave a 1 ⁄ 2 inch (1.3 cm) seam allowance and pull the lower layer of fabric towards the top edge as you sew so it gathers instead of staying flat. [9] X Research source Use thread that matches the color of your sofa's fabric. Gathering the fabric as you sew the curve is called easing and it prevents the fabric from puckering at 1 end of the curve."

      "content": "Make straight stitches around the other half of your cover's edge. Place the center of the fabric back under the needle. Start sewing where you began before, but sew in the other direction until you reach the bottom edge. Remember to leave a 1 ⁄ 2 inch (1.3 cm) seam allowance. [10] X Research source If you're an experienced sewer, you can sew from the bottom edge up along the curve to the center and then down the other edge in 1 pass, but sewing the cover with 2 seams gives you more control."

Fold the edges of the cover under by 1 ⁄ 4 inch (0.64 cm) and fold them by another 1 ⁄ 4 inch (0.64 cm) to make a rolled hem. Sew along the folded edge with a straight stitch and repeat this around every edge of the armrest cover. [11] X Research source If you don't want to pin the fabric in place, fold the fabric and iron it. Creasing the fabric holds stops it from unfolding as you sew."

      "content": "Repeat the entire process to make another armrest. If your sofa armrests are symmetrical, use the same measurements when you sew the front and top pieces. If the armrests curve away from each other, you'll need to adjust the shape of the front piece before you sew the cover. If you need to wash the armrest covers, read the care instructions that came with your sofa. If you're using a different type of fabric, read the bolt or care instructions for the fabric you used."
