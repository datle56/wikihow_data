      "content": "It’s normal to be extra affectionate when you’re greeting someone. Hellos and goodbyes can be pretty emotional.

Examples include: [5] X Research source Greeting your partner with a kiss at the airport after they’ve been away on a business trip Hugging a friend you haven’t seen in a long time Hugging and kissing family members who are coming to visit for the holidays"

      "content": "Small acts of affection, like hand-holding, are generally acceptable. Things like hugging and hand-holding are more common in American society.

Some examples of these milder versions of PDA include: [6] X Research source Walking hand-in-hand with your partner or friend Giving your partner or friend a big hug Resting your head on your partner’s shoulder while on public transit Posting a picture of you giving your partner or friend a kiss on the cheek"

      "content": "More explicit forms of PDA in front of family members might be frowned upon. In some cases, family members might consider such intimate acts to be disrespectful and inappropriate. Of course, each family has different opinions on what is and isn’t acceptable when it comes to PDA. Just be aware that certain actions might make family members uncomfortable and remember to be respectful of them. Here are some examples of things that might not be as acceptable: Having a passionate make-out session with your partner in front of others Getting a bit too touchy with your significant other while cuddling on the couch Being overly handsy when hugging your partner Things like giving your partner a kiss that doesn’t get too hot and heavy or subtly caressing their arm or leg might be more acceptable to family members. Each family has their own boundaries, so just be cautious of their reactions. If you’re not sure what others may deem to be appropriate, refrain from PDA in general just to play it safe. In this case, less is best."

      "content": "Avoid engaging in PDA in crowded places. The more crowded the place is, the higher chance you have of disrupting someone else. While kissing might be okay in some settings, if you’re in a crowded place and kissing your partner ends with you blocking someone’s path, you might be given the stink eye. Some other places to refrain from PDA include: [8] X Research source The mall or another crowded shopping center In the middle of a street with lots of foot traffic In a doorway where lots of people have to pass through Social media sites can also be considered to be “crowded” places.

      "content": "Other people might feel embarrassed or uncomfortable. In American society, many people often view gestures that go beyond a friendly hug or something simple like holding hands in a somewhat sexual context. Therefore, more extreme forms of PDA can make people around you very uncomfortable. When you kiss your partner out in public, the people around you become an unwilling audience to your affection. This is why PDA is usually seen in a more negative light. [10] X Research source"

If you’re single, seeing two people passionately kiss or be all lovey-dovey with one another might not be something you care to see. For some people, PDA can be an unwanted reminder of their own single status and make them feel all the more lonely. This goes for both displays of affection out in public spaces and on social media.
