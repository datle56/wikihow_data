Then, read the directions on the side of the bottle to see how it’s designed to be opened. There are 4 possible types: push down and turn, squeeze the sides and turn, push down the tab and turn, and line up the arrows. [1] X Research source For \"push down and turn,\" the lid has an arrow pointing down or a label that says \"push.\" A \"squeeze the sides and turn\" lid has grooves around the lid to help you squeeze and turn it. For \"push down the tab and turn,\" the lid has a small raised tab that says \"push\" and possibly arrows to indicate a turning motion. A \"line up the arrows\" lid has an arrow pointing downward and another arrow on the lip of the container pointing upward."

Then, twist the cap and turn it until the bottle top comes free. [2] X Research source There are notches inside both the cap and mouth of the bottle holding the cap in place. Those notches don’t catch on each other when you squeeze the cap, allowing the cap to slide free."

Then, twist the cap to fully unscrew it from the bottle. A lot of pharmacy prescription bottles use this design. There's a tiny angled piece attached to the tab that holds the cap in place—but when you push the tab down, the angled piece lowers and unlocks. Remember: if you struggle with childproof locks due to arthritis or other conditions, ask your pharmacist to deliver prescriptions with non-childproof lids. [3] X Research source"

There's a ridge around the mouth of the bottle to keep it shut, except where the two arrows align. Turn the cap until its arrow lines up with the arrow on the lip of the container.

[5] X Research source You'll have leverage that you can use to lift the cap up despite the childproof lock on the bottle. This method can work with any bottle type as long as there's enough space between the bottle's cap and body to accommodate the hard surface. A wide-edged table is ideal since it gives you the most leverage when using this method. However, any hard-edge surface in your home works."

[9] X Research source If you have the ability to use our other hand, use it to holding the cap in place. Alternatively, ask someone else for help Or, try placing a non-slip surface on the counter or table. A silicone baking mat or something with a similar texture helps hold the bottle in place."

[12] X Research source This works with any type of bottle cap, especially those that require you to push or twist the cap. It’s also a handy way to open a liquid bottle since turning it upside-down or using a hard edge to pull it could spill the liquid. The Dycem Bottle Opener is designed for individuals with limited arm mobility, as it only requires you to use your fingers or the palm of your hand and light pressure to open a container.

[15] X Research source You can use this technique to open a “push and turn” bottle of Tylenol. “Push down and turn” bottles have two caps, an outer cap that moves freely and an inner cap that unlocks when pressure is applied to the outer cap.

Liquid bottles like cough syrup and mouthwash often have “squeeze and turn” caps, so this is a handy way to keep your liquid products accessible in the long term. Leaving the caps partially open exposes the pills to air and allows them to spill easily, so clipping off the tabs is a more convenient workaround!"
