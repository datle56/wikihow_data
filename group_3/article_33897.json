      "content": "Plan out your outfit. Look through your clothes and think about which outfits look best on you. Think about what colors you get complimented while wearing and what shirts you’d wear on a date. Make sure to stay away from busy patterns, white, bright colors, and clothing with words or big logos. [1] X Research source When in doubt, wear a dark, solid color. [2] X Research source Don’t wear anything too low-cut. [3] X Research source Christina Santelli. Professional Stylist.

      "content": "Keep your accessories simple. Big earrings, watches, bracelets, necklaces, scarves, or other accessories will just distract from your face and smile. If you want to wear accessories, it’s better to choose small, simple ones that don’t immediately demand attention. [6] X Research source Go with a thin gold or silver necklace chain with a small pendant instead of a chunky colorful necklace with a thicker chain. Make sure to wear a watch that’s appropriate for your wrist size and isn’t too flashy. Even just changing your eyeglass frames can give you a fresh, cool look.

      "content": "Keep your makeup natural-looking. Have your makeup look as clump-free and natural as possible. Be conservative with the amount you use or else it might appear “cakey.” Keep in mind that you want a subtle enhancement, not anything too extreme. [8] X Research source Stick to just one light coat of brown mascara to give your eyes a subtle enhancement. Stay away from extremely bright or dark lipsticks."

      "content": "Don’t change your appearance too much. Hold off on making any major changes to your appearance, such as switching to a new acne cream or dyeing your hair an exciting new color.

      "content": "Don’t worry about looking perfect. Try not to get too stressed about looking amazing. If you just lost your front tooth or you have a couple fly away hairs you can’t quite secure, it’s okay. In the future, you’ll want to look back on the picture you take and see what you really looked like at this age. A couple of endearing imperfections aren’t going to ruin that. [10] X Research source"

      "content": "Practice angles and choose one. School pictures are usually taken straight-on, but very subtle changes in your head positioning can make a big difference. When you practice smiling in the mirror or in selfies, test out slightly different head positions to find out which one makes your facial features look best. If possible, avoid cheesy poses such as resting your head on your fist. [12] X Research source Make sure you sit or stand up straight when your picture is taken."
