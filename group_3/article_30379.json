Diarrhea is a sickness and it justifies staying home, so they might agree to call the school and come get you. If you're staying at school but you'll need to leave for the bathroom regularly, ask to talk to your teacher privately and tell them you’re having stomach problems. They’ll might dismiss you to the nurse so you can deal with the issue privately, or let you use the bathroom as much as you need.

This may help ensure that you don’t experience any flare-ups during class or another inconvenient time. If you end up late for class, explain to your teacher that you’re sick and apologize for being tardy. [2] X Research source Put your own health first. If you're having trouble communicating with your teacher or are not receiving the help you need, do not hesitate to put your own wellness first, even if it means walking out of the class without permission."

      "content": "Sit near the exit for each class. If you have to go to the bathroom often, let your teacher know what’s going on and ask if you can sit next to the door. If it’s open seating, grab the nearest seat. This way, you can slip out if you feel ill without disrupting the class or drawing attention to yourself. [3] X Research source Consider asking to sit on the floor next to the door if necessary. If anyone asks, just say “my back is killing me today and sitting on those chairs makes it worse.” Avoid making a commotion if you do leave. Get up as gently as possible and quietly open the door to avoid drawing attention to yourself."

The odds are extremely low you’ll need them, but they’ll help relieve any anxiety you feel about having an accident at a minimum. If you’re already at school, ask the school nurse if they have a spare set of clothing or call your parents to see if they can bring you new clothes. [4] X Trustworthy Source Cancer Research UK U.K.-based cancer research and advocacy charity Go to source Cover the back of your trousers with your bookbag or shirt until you can get to a bathroom or the nurse’s office to change. Bring identical clothing if you can. This way, nobody will notice if you change. If anyone asks, you can say “I ate too much at lunch and my other jeans were uncomfortably tight\" or \"I spilled pop on my other pair.\""

If it helps, remember that everyone poops and everybody will experience diarrhea at some point in their lives. You will get through this, so try to not fixate on the diarrhea. [5] X Research source If the diarrhea is the result of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), you’ll actually be less likely to experience the urge to poop if you worry about it."

      "content": "Be as cool and Zen as possible to keep your stomach calm. Feeling panicky or anxious about diarrhea may make it worse since the body’s response to emergencies is to loosen bowel control. By talking yourself through it and reframing the situation, you can calm yourself and your bowels . Remember: stomach issues are totally normal. Everyone gets them. [7] X Research source Avoid thoughts such as “what if I don’t make it to the bathroom” and “this is awful.” Instead, remember that accidents are rare and that you’ve never had one or that if you stay calm, your bowels will stay calm, too. Do some deep breathing exercises to keep you and your intestines calm. Some people actually get diarrhea when they're anxious or nervous about other things. If this is your situation, know that it's totally normal. Your stomach issues will pass when your stress does, and you can help them pass even faster using the breathing exercises mentioned above."

However, these actions can actually make diarrhea worse by causing muscle fatigue, weakness, pain, and cramping. Avoid straining or squeezing as much as you can. Instead, just take your time and don’t force it on the toilet. [8] X Research source This is true when you’re actually using the bathroom, but it’s also good guidance when it comes to “holding it” in the classroom. Try not to flex or squeeze unless it’s 100% necessary."
