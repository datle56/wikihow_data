      "content": "Practice learning to roll in calm, shallow water. Have a friend spot you while you are learning how to roll. It's always a good idea to establish a distress signal, too, so you can communicate if you need help. Setting up to roll is important not only during practice but also during normal kayaking. It will help you roll over quickly and efficiently."

      "content": "Align your paddle alongside your kayak. Hold your paddle in both hands on the side of the kayak opposite your dominant hand. Hold the paddle right above the water's surface with the front blade flat to the surface of the water. [2] X Research source If your paddle is feathered, with a concave curve on one side of the blade, hold that side up. This is also called the “power” face of your paddle. For example, if you are right handed, hold the paddle on your left-hand side to set up for the roll."

      "content": "Swing your front paddle blade out to 90 degrees to the kayak. Keep your paddle blade as close to the surface of the water as you can while you are head-down underwater. Your arms will act as a pivot during the turn, leveraging against the kayak. [5] X Research source This position will help you get the most leverage to press down against the water and right yourself."

      "title": "Keep your hands in the “power position” to avoid shoulder injuries.",
      "content": "Keep your hands in the “power position” to avoid shoulder injuries. Imagine an invisible line between each of your shoulders and another dividing your body in half vertically. Through the roll, avoid having either hand cross the midline or move behind your shoulder line. To do this, rotate your torso whenever your rotate your arms to keep your body aligned. [6] X Research source Watch your blade move through the water when you swing it out to 90 degrees. This will naturally cause your torso to rotate in alignment with your hands."

      "content": "Use your opposite forearm as a pivot against the bottom of your kayak. With your front paddle blade out at 90 degrees, pull downward against the surface of the water. Use your arm against the kayak bottom as leverage to increase the strength of your pull. [7] X Research source"

      "title": "Perform a hip snap to lift yourself out of the water.",
      "content": "Perform a hip snap to lift yourself out of the water. As you press down against the surface of the water, use your hips and dominant knee to rock the kayak upright with the force of your pull. As you rotate, leave your head and shoulders in the water as long as possible. Lifting your head and shoulders out of the water too early (they are heavy!) can zap the momentum from your roll. Practice your hip snap to build speed. The more you practice, the more quickly you'll be able to roll and right yourself."
