      "content": "Decide whether to rinse. All quinoa naturally produces bitter substances called saponins. Most companies treat the quinoa to remove most of the saponins before they reach the store, but there may still be a faint biter taste. [1] X Research source Rinsing will remove this, but you'll have to wait at least half an hour for the seeds to dry. If you decide not to rinse, skip down to the puffing instructions ."

This usually takes thirty to sixty minutes. [3] X Research source [4] X Research source To further reduce the risk of burning, leave the oven door ajar. You can move on to the stovetop before the quinoa is completely dry. You'll just have to wait for the moisture to evaporate before the quinoa pops, which can take 10–30 minutes.

Do this on the side facing away from you to avoid steam and quinoa rocketing to your face.
