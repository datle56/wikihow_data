      "title": "Wait until the soil reaches 70 °F (21 °C) to prevent rot.",
      "content": "Wait until the soil reaches 70 °F (21 °C) to prevent rot. When the soil is too cold, it prevents your caladiums from growing and it could take a few months before you see any new leaves. Check the temperatures and last frost dates in your area so you can find out when it’s warm enough to plant. You can always start caladiums in pots indoors up to 4 weeks before the last frost in your area. Otherwise, you can just wait to plant them directly in the ground. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Leaves and roots will only sprout from the eyes of the tuber.",
      "content": "Leaves and roots will only sprout from the eyes of the tuber. Caladiums may have a single large tuber or multiple smaller tubers clustered around a central one. Pull the caladiums out from the ground and find the large knobby tuber at the end of the stem. Use a sharp garden knife to slice pieces from the large tuber or to separate the smaller tubers. It doesn’t matter how large the piece is as long as it has at least 1 eye, which looks like a small bud or growth. [2] X Research source Caladium sap may irritate if you have sensitive skin, so wear gardening gloves. Disinfect your knife with 70% rubbing alcohol before and after dividing the tubers so you don’t spread any bacteria or fungi. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "This helps smaller buds expand and grow more leaves.",
      "content": "This helps smaller buds expand and grow more leaves. Look for the eye or bud on top of any pieces that have more than one eye. Poke the tip of your garden knife into the tuber next to the central bud. Tilt the blade down to remove the central bud so your caladiums look bushier at the end of the growing season. [4] X Research source Leaves may not grow as tall after you damage the central eye, but your caladiums will look a lot fuller. If you leave the central bud or eye, leaves grow taller but the smaller buds won’t sprout."

      "title": "Keep the tubers in the water for an hour before planting.",
      "content": "Keep the tubers in the water for an hour before planting. Fill a bowl with warm water and drop the tuber pieces inside. Leave them to soak for a little while before taking them out and planting them."

    {
      "title": "Caladiums look more colorful if they have a mix of shade and sun.",
      "content": "Caladiums look more colorful if they have a mix of shade and sun. Try to find a spot that gets sunlight during the morning and partial shade for the rest of the day. Sun throughout the entire day prevents the leaves from developing vibrant colors, so they won’t look as striking. [5] X Research source Only a few caladium varieties, such as Fire Chief, Hearts Delight, Cherry Tart, and White Cap, can tolerate full sunlight throughout the entire day."

    {
      "title": "Soil that’s too dense could cause the tubers to rot.",
      "content": "Soil that’s too dense could cause the tubers to rot. Test your soil by digging a 1 ft (0.30 m) hole and filling it with water. Let the water drain out completely and refill it again with your hose. After an hour, if the water level goes down by at least 1 inch (2.5 cm), then the soil drains well. [6] X Research source If not, mix a 2–3 in (5.1–7.6 cm) layer of compost into the soil to improve the drainage. [7] X Research source If you’re growing caladiums in containers, make sure the pots have drainage holes on the bottom so water can flow through them easily."

      "title": "Run a soil test to check for slightly acidic soil.",
      "content": "Run a soil test to check for slightly acidic soil. Use a home soil test to check the pH of your soil. [8] X Research source If you get a reading that’s above the range, apply aluminum sulfate or peat moss to help lower the pH. If the pH is too low, add limestone or wood ash to the soil instead. It might take a few treatments to fully amend your soil’s pH. After applying a treatment, run another test to check if you need to make any more adjustments."

      "title": "Keep the knobby side of the tuber face-up for more foliage.",
      "content": "Keep the knobby side of the tuber face-up for more foliage. Dig a small hole that’s about the same size as the tuber. Set the tuber in the hole so the eye or bud points up to ensure the leaves grow properly. After that, cover the tuber with loose soil. [9] X Research source Compacting the soil too much can prevent water from reaching it, so be careful not to press the soil down too hard."

      "content": "This helps airflow around your plants so they stay healthy. If you’re planting multiple caladiums, leave enough space between the tubers so they don’t compete for water or nutrients. Try putting caladium wherever you want a pop of color in your garden. [10] X Research source"

      "title": "Caladiums die off if the soil ever dries out.",
      "content": "Caladiums die off if the soil ever dries out. Use a watering can to thoroughly water the soil until it feels moist about 2 inches (5.1 cm) below the surface. Check the soil every day or two to see if it still feels moist. If the soil has dried out, water your plants again to keep them growing. [11] X Research source If you’re growing caladiums in pots, stop watering as soon as you see water coming out from the drainage holes."

      "title": "Mulch helps the soil hold moisture and prevents weeds.",
      "content": "Mulch helps the soil hold moisture and prevents weeds. Pick an organic mulch to help support your caladiums even more. Spread about 1–2 inches (2.5–5.1 cm) of mulch around the base of your plant, but be careful that it doesn’t touch the leaves since it could cause damage. [12] X Research source You should mulch your caladiums whether they’re planted in the ground or in pots."

      "title": "High-nitrogen fertilizers help promote colorful leaves.",
      "content": "High-nitrogen fertilizers help promote colorful leaves. The 3 numbers represent the amounts of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium in the fertilizer. You can use either a liquid or granular variety for your caladiums. Spread the fertilizer next to your plants and water them immediately so the nutrients absorb into the soil. [13] X Research source Alternatively, you can use a timed-release 15-9-12 fertilizer that slowly provides nutrients for the next 6 months. Fertilizer can damage or kill caladium leaves if it comes into contact with them, so use caution while you’re applying it."
