[1] X Expert Source Kathi Burns, CPO® Board Certified Professional Organizer Expert Interview. 31 December 2019. Any woman can wear prints, just keep in mind the silhouette. If you’re naturally curvy, use prints to play up one part of your body while keeping the rest of your outfit simple. If you’re naturally slim, you can wear prints with just about anything. For example, you might consider a printed blouse with a nipped in waist to create curves. [2] X Research source"

Solid colors will create a slim line and color blocking, which is a way of wearing two or more solid colors, will help further accentuate your curves. You can also use color blocking to create curves. For example, a dress that has side panels in a different color that taper in will define your waist and give you a curvier look.

      "content": "Choose clothing details to accentuate or create curves. Small clothing embellishments and details, such as a peplum or an A-line, will accentuate or create curves by drawing the eye towards specific areas of your body. [7] X Research source Peplums are a good way to make your hips look curvier. [8] X Research source The peplum should be structured and not hang loosely from the article of clothing. [9] X Research source If you’re wearing a peplum, stick to slim pants or pencil skirts that go below your knees to create a tapered look. This will make your hips look curvier and your waist smaller. [10] X Research source High necklines can make a woman look boxy, so opt for lower necklines that break up your chest area and draw attention towards your face. [11] X Research source Off the shoulder tops or strapless dresses draw horizontal lines across you and emphasize the widest part of your body. This makes your waist look smaller, helping to create an hourglass shape. [12] X Research source An A-line skirt that nips in at the waist will also help create curves, especially if you pair it with a more form fitting, tucked-in top. [13] X Research source Draping, which is often seen on soft, stretchy fabrics, is another way to create structure and highlight or create curves. [14] X Research source"
