Soak a cotton ball in some nail polish remover and use it to take off any leftover nail polish from your previous manicure. Even if you don’t have any polish on your nails, it's a good idea to do this to remove any natural oils from your nails—it will help the polish last longer and go on more smoothly. [1] X Research source Next, cut and file your nails until they’re your desired length and shape. [2] X Research source “If you use nail clippers, don’t cut the entire nail in one go,” says nail artist Marta Nagorska. “This will unnecessarily bend and weaken your nail at the sides. Instead, clip the nail a few times starting at one side and going across the nail to the other side, then use a nail file to create a smooth shape.” [3] X Expert Source Marta Nagorska Nail Artist Expert Interview. 26 May 2021. Nail artist Mia Rubie explains that the type of nail file you use matters, too. “You want to use a nail file that’s not super rough—something around 180 grit,” she says.

They can make your nail polish application look messy if they are not pushed back before you paint. It’s easier to push back your cuticles when they’ve been softened , so try soaking your nails in a small bowl of warm water for a minute or two first. Dry your hands and nails thoroughly, then use a cuticle pusher to push the soft skin of each cuticle back to the edge of the nail. [5] X Research source"

[9] X Research source This is called the 3-stripe method, and it makes for a super neat and mess-free application. Salon owner and nail specialist Kristin Pulaski explains that one of the biggest mistakes people make is applying too much polish for their first coat. “Sometimes people apply [a layer of polish] that’s way too thick because they want to see the pigment right away, but it’s like painting a wall—you do the first coat for coverage, then you wait two minutes and do the second coat to get the true color of what’s in the bottle,” she explains.

If you become impatient and try to finish the job quickly, you might ruin your good work! Allow the second layer of polish to dry completely, then decide if you need to apply a third. If you do need a third coat, apply it using the same method as the first two. Don’t exceed 3 coats—this can cause your polish to peel off and smudge more easily. [12] X Research source As you can see, painting your nails is time consuming, and you will need to allow yourself 30 minutes to an hour to do the job well. For this reason, it is a good idea to prepare a snack, go to the bathroom, and turn on the TV before you begin painting your nails so you won't be bored while waiting for your nails to dry."

It is an extremely sophisticated look, which can be achieved at home with a little practice. Contrary to what you might think, the white tip is actually painted on first using a special white polish provided in most home manicure kits , and then topped off with a sheer pink coat and a top coat. These kits may also provide adhesive strips which you can apply to your nails in order to get a perfectly straight white line across the tips. Otherwise you will need a very steady hand! If you want to shake things up, try using other colors, such as pink, purple, or blue, for your French tips. You can even do a different color for each nail if you want to get extra creative."

This type of nail art involves creating a gradient on each nail, so it looks like the paint transitions from a darker shade into a lighter shade. “There are a few different ways to create a gradient, but the easiest is with a makeup sponge,” explains Yoshitomi. Here’s her step-by-step guide on how to do it: [24] X Expert Source Lindsay Yoshitomi Nail Artist Expert Interview. 12 July 2019. To cut down on the clean-up time, apply a latex skin protector around each nail. (If you don’t have this, it’s okay—you’ll just need to clean up around the edges with nail polish remover when you’re done). Start by painting your whole nail using the lightest color that will be used in the gradient. Next, prep the makeup sponge by wetting it and squeezing out the excess water. This will help the colors blend better. Apply two stripes of polish on the makeup sponge, one in a slightly darker shade than your first color, and the second in an even deeper shade. Dab the sponge onto your nail, starting about a third of the way up (so the bottom stays the original base color). This should create a gradient effect with your three shades from lightest to darkest. Allow the paint to dry, then finish with a clear top coat.

Opt for cheerful yellow, bold red, cool blue, mysterious purple, flirty pink, earthy green—whatever your heart desires! If you’d like, you can take your skin undertones into account when choosing a color. For example, if your skin has cool undertones, colors like blue, lavender, and light baby pink will suit you super well. If you have warm undertones, on the other hand, shades with a hint of peach, gold, or honey in them look especially nice. [26] X Research source If you’re not sure what kind of undertones you have , look at the veins on your wrist. In general, blue veins mean you have cool undertones, green veins mean you have warm undertones, and a combination means you have neutral undertones.

If you don’t have access to nail polish thinner , Rubie says you can add a few drops of nail polish or acetone to revitalize old polish in a pinch, but she does offer a few warnings about this. “It’s not good to do this a ton over time because eventually you’re going to screw up the formula. But, if you really want that pink color and it’s dried up a little bit, it’s not going to kill your polish to do it one or two times,” she says.
