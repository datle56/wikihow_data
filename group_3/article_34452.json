      "content": "Apply the sole protector to a clean sole. Older shoes must be free from dirt and debris, or the sole protector will not stick. Most rubber sole protectors are a peel-and-stick variety, with clear instructions on the packaging. If you are using half-sole and heel lift protectors: Clean the bottom surfaces of the shoe, scraping off any old glue from previous sole protectors. Mark the appropriate location of the sole protector before applying glue to ensure an accurate placement. Apply the rubber cement and affix the half sole and heel lift. Wrap the shoes tightly with string and allow the glue to cure for at least five hours."

      "content": "Remove any stickers from the soles and wash your hands. The screen protector will not adhere well to the sole if the sticker is in the way. Check both shoes, but the sizing sticker is generally on the right shoe. Washing your hands gets rid of any residue or excess oil that will make handling the sticky side of the screen protector difficult."
