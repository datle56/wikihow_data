[1] X Research source If an employer hires an undocumented immigrant, then it may be subject to civil and criminal penalties. The minimum penalty for a first-time offense is $375 per worker. However, if the company or individual engages in a “pattern or practice” of hiring unlawful workers, then the penalties increase up to $3,000 for each unlawful worker. The employer may also face six months in jail.

For example, you don’t have the right to snoop through the company mail, hack into someone’s computer system, or steal information. Leave the investigation to ICE. All you need to do is gather as much information as possible and report the potential violation to the federal government."

[4] X Research source You might want to report anonymously if you also work for the company or individual.

[7] X Research source On the online form, check “Employment/Exploitation of Unlawful Workers” under the Suspected Violation. Then type in the location of the violation. You also are provided 2500 characters to provide a summary of the violation. You must also answer a basic math question at the bottom of the form (e.g., “13 plus 6”) so that the agency can tell that you are a human visitor and not a bot."
