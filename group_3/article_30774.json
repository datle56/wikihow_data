      "content": "Avoid asking if they are a girl. If you start off the conversation asking if the other person is a girl, you're bound to drive most people away. Let the conversation happen a bit, and you'll likely be able to figure out the truth after a little while. If you are doing a video chat, make sure that the other person is real. It is fairly easy to fake a video using a recording, so ensure that the person is actually talking to you live."
