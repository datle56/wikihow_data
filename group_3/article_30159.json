If you want a standard sized pompom, drape it across your forefinger and middle finger. If you'd like a bigger pompom, extend the yarn over your ring finger too.

      "title": "Wrap the yarn around your fingers.",
      "content": "Wrap the yarn around your fingers. Do not wrap the yarn too tightly, or you will risk cutting off your circulation. If your fingers start to turn blue or purple, you are wrapping too tightly. Wrapping the yarn too tightly will also make it harder to slide it off in the end. How many times you wrap the yarn around your fingers will depend on how big you want the pompom to be: [4] X Research source If you are using two fingers, wrap the yarn 100 to 125 times. If you are using three fingers, wrap the yarn 125 to 150 times. The more you wrap, the bigger and thicker your pompom is going to be.
