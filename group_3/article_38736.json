      "content": "While you can’t send money through Snapchat itself, there are many options available. Since Snapcash is no longer a Snapchat feature, you’ll need to use a different method to send money. Snapcash allowed users to send money to others within the Snapchat app after linking a debit card or bank account, but this feature was removed in August 2018. While Snapchat no longer offers a way to send money within the app, there are plenty of easy-to-use services available that can help you send money to someone on Snapchat."
