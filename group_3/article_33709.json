Many mobile service providers allow you to check your number eligibility online. Not all numbers are eligible to be ported. If you are moving to a new geographic area, the new service provider does not have a transfer agreement with your old provider, or you still have an outstanding balance or are under contract with your old provider, you may not be eligible to port your number. Many rural landline phone service providers are also exempt from being required to port numbers.

If you are still under contract with your current service, you may have to pay a cancellation fee. You will continue to pay for your current plan until your number is ported and the service is officially cancelled. While AT&T, Sprint and Verizon do not charge a porting fee, other networks, such as Google Voice, do charge for this service."
