If you've moved since your last checks were ordered, or if you know you will be moving to a new address in the immediate future, be sure to update your address with the most current information. If you've changed your name (for example, after marriage), you'll want to update that information as well, though for name changes you may need to contact a bank representative over the phone or in person.

A cashier's check is purchased at the bank, and the amount is withdrawn from your account immediately.
