      "content": "Sprinkle small amounts of baking soda gradually into food during cooking to reduce the acidity in the food. Taste the food often, until the tart flavor of the food is reduced. Baking soda is sodium bicarbonate, which is a form of salt. If you are concerned about your sodium intake, add as little baking soda as possible until the food's tartness (and acid) is sufficiently reduced. [1] X Research source"

In addition to reducing the acid, soaking beans in hot water makes your body better able to absorb the nutritious minerals in the beans. Reduce the phytic acid content of grains by soaking them the same way you soak beans."
