      "content": "Repeat the person's name as soon as he or she introduces it to you. Saying it out loud a few times will help you commit to memory.s Apply this method during introductions. As you shake the person's hand, you can say, \"Hello, [insert name].\" If a conversation follows, repeat her name throughout the time. If you are unable to speak to the person for long, bid her goodbye and repeat her name again before she leaves. Attempt to use the person's name two or three times throughout the conversation so that you remember it better. For example, when meeting a new colleague at work, shake her hand and say, \"Hello, [insert name]. Welcome to the office!\" Include her name when asking her questions, such as, \"What made you interested in working in technology, [insert name]?\" The more often you repeat the person's name right away, the more likely you are to remember it later.

      "title": "Ask them to spell their name.",
      "content": "Ask them to spell their name. If their name is difficult to remember, asking for the correct spelling will give you a visual image. This also works for names you have never heard before, such as \"Honghui\" and \"Kichiro\". As they spell it out, you will be able to envision the way the name in spelled in your head. Also, this method will give you the chance to hear the correct pronunciation of their name again. This method can be applied to names with different spellings as well. For example, the name \"Shawn\" could also be spelled \"Sean\" or even \"Shon\". By clarifying the spelling of the person's name, you will be able to correctly identify their name. This method cannot be applied to common names, such as \"Harry.\" If you are unable to ask the person to spell their name, see if they have a business card. Having a visual image and physical reminder of his name will help you recall it. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Ask the person to repeat her name.",
      "content": "Ask the person to repeat her name. If it's near the start of the conversation and you forget their name, say, \"I'm sorry, but I didn't catch your name.\" If you're asking later on towards the end of the conversation, in order to sound polite, say something along the lines of, \"I've enjoyed talking to you, but I can't seem to remember your name. Please repeat it for me\". The compliment will soften the blow of having forgotten his/her name. Although you may feel embarrassed when asking for their name again, following this step will prevent awkward situations from occurring in the future. It is best to apply this method early in the relationship rather than later. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Make associations.",
      "content": "Make associations. Identify a person's name with a fact about them. By doing this, you will be able to recall their name by viewing a mental image of the person and their personality or job. For example, if you meet a client named Tyler who sells printer toner, say to yourself, \"Tyler sells toner.\" Although this sentence may sound simple, it will help you remember their name in the long run. If there isn't a catchy phrase associated with the person's name, create a mental image of them performing an activity that they enjoy. For example, if you meet a man named Dylan who is a fan of baseball, imagine them wearing a baseball cap. When you meet him again, you will have an image to associate with him. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Repeat the name in your head.",
      "content": "Repeat the name in your head. By repeating it a few times, you will plant it into your memory. Although you should actively participate in the conversation, focus on recalling their name. When listening to them speak, think, \"Danny told me about his new car.\" [5] X Research source Mentally play with the name to help it stick. Over exaggerate the syllables, break it into parts, or associate a bit of it with other words. For example, the name Natalie can be exaggerated to sound like \"Naaat-ahhh-leee.\" Also, it can be made into nonsense words, such as, \"Nat-Tall-Lee,\" \"Nat-bat,\" or \"Lee-key.\" Different combinations will help ingrain their name into your memory.

      "content": "Make connections. Connect the name of the person with someone in your life, such as a celebrity, a friend, or a family member. You can do this by noting that they have the same hair color, style, etc. Make the connection as close as possible in order to remember why you associated them. For example, you meet a new classmate. You could connect them with your high school lab partner because they both have the same name and hair color. You could also associate them with a movie character because they both have the same appearance. Note that the connection doesn't have to make sense to anyone but you. [7] X Research source State your connection out loud. For example, once the person introduces themself, you could say, \"My sister just named her son [insert name]!\" You will not only contribute to the conversation but also help you recall their name."

      "title": "Care enough about the person to remember.",
      "content": "Care enough about the person to remember. Often, people forget names because their attentions are divided. Meeting someone with the intention to remember the name will increase your chances of doing so. Focus your attention on the person to whom you are being introduced to. Consciously think about how you care about the introduction, as well as the goal to remember his/her name. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Make a mnemonic device. A mnemonic device is a verbal phrase or visual cue that helps you remember information. Apply this method using the person's name. For example, if you meet a man named Derek who likes to workout, create a phrase such as, \"Dude Enjoys Really Energetic Kickboxing.\" This associates their name with words that describe a fact that you learned about him. You can make the phrases as simple or as hard as you want. As long as they stick in your head, they will help you remember the person's name. [9] X Research source"

List the time and place that you met him or her, as well as actions he completes or interesting information that she mentioned in your conversation. Writing down these facts will help you recall her name, especially since you have a physical reminder. Also, it will also give you a source to refer to if you meet her again. [10] X Research source Large events may not give you the chance to instantly write down names, especially since many introductions may be made. Instead, insert important names into your phone. Later, you can refer to them and add interesting facts that will help you recall them. Another excellent method is to leave yourself an audio message. You could also create a virtual file. Create a document or table with people's names on it. Add to it each time you meet a new person. Share the file with all your devices in order to always keep a physical reminder with you.

      "content": "Create a mental picture. Take the person's name and turn it into a picture in your mind. Associate the name with an object. For example, the name Crystal could be identified with a large crystal vase or bowl. A visual connection can be a powerful tool when recalling names. [12] X Research source This also works with names that sound similar to a concept. For example, you have a new man at work named Miles. You can associate him with a picture of a long road that goes on for miles."

      "content": "Imagine a ridiculous scenario. An excellent method to remember a person is to think of an absurd scene in relation to them. For example, if you meet someone who owns a pet grooming business, think of the person surrounded by dogs in crazy hairstyles. A humorous image will help you recall their name, as well as a specific fact about him. The more ridiculous the image, the more likely you are to remember it. [14] X Research source"
