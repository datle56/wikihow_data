      "content": "Cut off dying blooms throughout the blooming season. If any of your lilies begin to wilt or look brown during peak blooming season (spring-summer months), deadheading them is a great way to get rid of unwanted decay. Removing dead lily heads may encourage new growth and make help make your lily plant and garden look neater. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Use small, lightweight shears to prune your lilies. They tend to make a gentler cut than other types of shears, like grass shears or loppers and are ideal for your delicate lily blooms. From deadheading to pruning, this multi-purpose tool has got you covered. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Deadhead the stem by cutting the flower spike at its base.",
      "content": "Deadhead the stem by cutting the flower spike at its base. Follow the stalk of the lily to the base of the flower spike (a group of flowers arising from the main stem). Lilies flower at the end of a long stalk attached to the center of the lily plant. To “deadhead” lilies, follow the stalk to the flower spike and locate the first set of leaves on the stem needing removal. Use pruning shears to clip the stalk at a 45-degree angle at the first set of leaves arising from the flower spike. [3] X Research source If you cannot see into the center of the plant, use your hand to follow the stalk down to the base. Get as close to the leaves as possible to encourage new growth. Wear gloves to protect your hands during gardening."

      "title": "Disinfect your shears",
      "content": "Disinfect your shears with rubbing alcohol between cuts. If you’re shearing dead or diseased blooms or foliage, it’s important to disinfect the shears in between cuts. Otherwise, you risk spreading disease to healthy parts of the plant. To disinfect, dip, spray, or wipe the blades of the shears in rubbing alcohol with a concentration of 70% or higher.

      "title": "Leave yellowing or browning stalks until late fall.",
      "content": "Leave yellowing or browning stalks until late fall. If you notice that some of your lily’s foliage is turning yellow but not brown, leave it alone. The yellow stalks won’t affect the overall health of your plant, and cutting them down early actually decreases the amount of energy the plant can put into creating new flowers for the next blooming season.

      "title": "Prune back yellow stalks after the first frost.",
      "content": "Prune back yellow stalks after the first frost. Once the first frost has occurred, your lily plant no longer needs the energy produced by the foliage stalks, making it a-ok to cut them back. Use your shears to cut the yellow foliage stalks down to the ground at a 45-degree angle.

Add 4-6 inches (10-15 cm) of mulch around the base of your lovely lilies to protect the bulbs from the winter cold."
