      "content": "Reach level 2. You cannot play in the competitive ranks until you reach a normal rank of 2, which you can do by getting exp in different game modes. The recommended way to do this is to play deathmatch, as it gets you used to the types of guns that you will be playing with. Casual is also a good option, as it gets you used to the type of playing you will be doing in Competitive, a bomb scenario with limited money. Consider getting Prime Matchmaking. This requires you to level up to level 21 and activate a 2-step verification with a phone, however you will meet fewer hackers and \"smurfs\" this way. Casual also allows you to learn the main routes to get to the bomb site, meaning you will have more knowledge for the map."

      "content": "Lower your sensitivity. This may seem counter-intuitive, as slower spinning means slower reactions, however the added accuracy is worth it. Since most guns can give a one shot headshot, accuracy is everything. For best results, find out how far you need to make your mouse move to do a full 360. Your mouse should move about 25 cm. If you are only moving 5 or 15 cm, a drastic change is needed If your mousepad isn't big enough, a bigger one may be necessary, there are many places to get a 36 by 42 cm mousepad."

      "content": "Get a good headset. Audio is a huge part of the game, and you can hear some sounds across the map, so you can determine where the any is even if you aren't near them. Coming with a good headset, of course, is raising your audio levels. Since you cannot predict how loud other people's microphones will be, you should keep the chat volume semi-low, and put the environmental sounds high"

      "content": "Get used to the spray patterns of weapons. Each of the main weapons has a definitive pattern in which their bullets go. You don't need to do this for every gun, just with the main weapons, such as an AK-47, M4A1-S (or M4A4), along with the SMG of your choice, the p90 is recommended. You only need to learn the first 6-7 bullets, as they are the only bullets that change vertically, the rest go left and right randomly, however with it going up, you need to know how far to lower your weapon to get optimal headshot range. Consider downloading a practice map off the workshop, they can be a good way to warm and practice your shots."

      "content": "Practice with lesser-used guns. There will be time in the game in where you will need to use sub-machine guns or shotguns, such as on an anti-eco when your opponent is saving. You will need to know how to shoot with these weapons and kill people quickly so they will not be able to kill you and steal your gun. Be aware of how to spray with these guns, or how to use each shotgun. In most cases, you are able to run-and-gun with these weapons, so don't be afraid to change your style when using these weapons."

      "content": "Place your crosshair optimally. When you are just walking around, don't have your crosshair near the body or feet, have it at about head level. Reason being, if you see an enemy that surprises you, you don't have time to get your gun into position then fire, you need to be able to get the first shot off right then. If you type \"cl_showpos 1\" into console, then it tells you what Y coordinate you are related to the head, 0.00 being head height."

      "content": "Learn the callouts of each map. The best way to do this would be to go into a private match game, then look in the top left and see what each place you travel too. However, some places are not consistent with the game, such as on cache, where the right side route to A is not called \"Corridor\", but rather \"Squeaky\". You can pick this up pretty fast in competitive. In addition, you should know common economical call-outs. A \"full-save\" is where your team buy absolutely nothing, to save all your money for the next round. This is uncommon, most often seen if CT's win the first round, buy, and lose the second round. A \"half-save\" or \"half-buy\" is where you buy with about half of your money, so what you buy depends on your money. If you only have two or three thousand, buy armor and a pistol such as the P250 or Tec-9. If you have 5-6 thousand, you can consider buying a lower tier SMG or an SSG. An \"anti-eco\" round is a round in which you know the other team will be saving, so it would be unwise to buy powerful guns like AKs. As such, you should buy armor better at dispatching unarmored foes, such as the Mac-10 or UMP. A \"full buy round\" is a round in which you spend all or most of your money for this round, buying utilities like smokes and flashes."

Along with this, you can learn some more unique grenade placements or places to boost."

The people you play with might not even be able to talk, or just be griefing. If you can get a team of people that you know or get to know, your team can start doing better. This means that you know exactly where each person is going to be each round, and you can count on them to be where you expect to be, as well as you know how well that person can play, so you can guide them if needed."

You can't expect to call a \"Cat Rush to B\" for example without ever talking it over with your team what that means. Go into each map, and talk over who is going to do what in whatever play you call. For example, if you call a \"Cat to B\" on Dust II, you can have one member watch mid, one throw a smoke to Lower Tunnels, one to peek to site etc. Your team will be a mess if you all just run in to site spraying everywhere."

An overlook of each type and who should play is below, but keep in mind these are not concrete roles. You may need to change up who is your support or lurk player if the other team keeps easily picking them off, or you may need to change your IGL if they aren't calling good plays.' In Game Leader or IGL is the one who calls the plays. They can also be any of the other roles, as this is only really during the beginning of the round, and the rest is watching your and the other team's economy to make sure you know what to do next. The entry-fragger. This player's point is to be the first one who goes into confrontations and gets the damage. Getting kills is good, but not absolutely necessary, as their main roles is to do significant damage onto lots of people so that the support player can mop up the kills, as well as get the information as to where the other team is. This person should always be given a rifle, even if they cannot afford it, and will die a lot with few kills, so their scoreboard rank may not be the best. The Support. This person follows quickly behind the entry-fragger. They have 2 main roles. They are there to provide utility to the entry, by flashing them in, providing a smoke if they need to get away, or watching their back while the fragger rushes in. The other role is to clean up the people the fragger has tagged. The person needs to be accurate, maybe even more than the entry-fragger, as the support needs to be able to hit the shots, as if this player dies, you have few people left that can easily kill them. The AWPer. As the name suggests, this person carries an AWP and uses it to either pick long or hold angles. Before that, they need to understand the economy. The AWP costs 4750 to buy, which unless you win every round including the anti-eco without dying, isn't going to be in a lot of people's price range, so they are going to need to save a lot in the first few rounds. This person, instead of buying a M4 or AK in the anti-eco, will often buy a FAMAS or Galil to save money. If they are on the CT side, they often won't buy a helmet or grenades either, to save even more money. Once they have an AWP, this person looks down mid, or the middle of any map. This is not only to get kills, but to see how many people are going to each site as well. This information can change your strategy depending on how many people are going to each site. The lurker. This person is one who goes alone, walking, to other parts of the map to try to catch people rotating to the bomb, or from site to site. This person normally excels in the mid to late round game, as people are either rushing to get to the bomb, or rushing to get away from it, not checking every corner."

If the round starts and people are standing in spawn just waiting for someone to lead them, you give the CTs valuable seconds to get set up and just wait it out. You have to have maximum coordination and preparation when taking a site, and everyone needs to be on board. Even if you aren't the one who normally calls bomb sites, but you notice that the pre-round is ticking away, you may need to make a decision and call it."

Knowing this, everyone should rush the bomb site, picking up frags wherever you can, but rushing the bomb plant. After planting the bomb, you want to waste as much time as possible. In the first round, odds are there is only one, if any defuse kit on the CT side, meaning they are going to need a lot of time to get the bomb defused. If you can get the bomb planted, but still lose, you get an extra 800 each on top of the 1400 from losing a round, as well as a 300 bonus for whomever planted the bomb."

      "content": "Plan your next move depending on whether or not you won the pistol round. Knowing that if you won, you have the economy in your favor, and vice versa for the CTs, your strategies should differ. If you won the pistol round, odds are you will probably win the next one, however do not get cocky. The CTs will probably save the next round, meaning you should have a light buy with good anti-eco uses. What this means is, since the CTs are saving, they are probably not going to buy armor, this allows for guns with low armor penetration, but high damage or fire rate to become extremely effective. Two good examples of this are the MP9 and the Nova shotgun. These offer a high damage output against unarmored opponents, as well as gives you a hefty kill reward, with 600 and 900 for SMGs and shotguns respectively, but be wary. If the CTs manage to win, especially by killing all of you, your economy is essentially gone for the next two rounds, forcing you to save. Get the bomb plant off and watch out for CTs going in for a sneaky defuse! If you lose the pistol round, but planted the bomb, make your goal to be able to buy fully in the third round. You cannot buy effectively the second round, so it's wiser to save all your money, saving a smoke or two, as you will get a combined 3500 from losing two rounds in a row. You will also have an extra 800 from getting the bomb down, bringing your total to 4300, which is enough to buy armor and a helmet, an AK, and quite a few grenades, like a smoke or a Molotov and a flashbang. For this round, focus on getting the bomb planted and stealing a few guns. Everyone should be a in wolf pack, save the lurker, maybe, and go for picks while rushing on a bomb site. If you kill one, take their rifle and try to keep it until the next round, as you will benefit your economy when you don't need to buy a new gun. Get the bomb down early, as the extra 800 will give you a full set of grenades, or even the AWP player an AWP to look mid with, provided they don't buy armor. Losing this round isn't a huge deal, as you can buy on the third round regardless, but it would be a nice bonus. If you lost the pistol round and did not get a bomb plant, you need to force buy. Since you received 1400 from losing, and whatever, if any, money you had left from the pistol round, the only supplies you can buy is armor and a pistol, preferably the Tec-9 or P250, due to their one shot capacities. You need a win here, otherwise you will be saving for 2 more rounds, which are hard, but not impossible to win on. You need to get early kills to pick up rifles, as they will be your saving grace when defending the bomb site. Plant the bomb if you can, but don't take unnecessary risks in doing so. Getting the win is everything, and since most people will have pistols, saving isn't that important except for the armor. Losing here sets you back miles, forcing you to save for two more rounds at least."

      "content": "Plan the third round. If you've won the first 2 rounds, you have a decision. You can stick with your weapons, or upgrade to a \"full buy\", which means buy AKs. If you know the CTs cannot do a surprise buy, which is buying FAMAS on the third round, because they had bought the second round, stick with your guns. If you think they might buy weapons, buy up yourself. This is similar to counting cards in blackjack, you need to know where the money is and who has it. If you can predict what the CTs will do based on their economy, then you can also plan accordingly. If you lost the first round, but got bomb planted on the second round, this is you chance to make a come back. Buy up armor and AKs, and grenades if you can afford them. If you lost both rounds without a bomb plant, you will have to save."

They then get another attempt to take back the win and force the other team to spend more money, and eventually try to save. You need to keep an eye on the CT economy here, as they need to spend more than you. The M4A4 and M4A1-s cost 400 and 200 more respectively than the AK, and they also need to buy defuse kits. Your goal should be similar here, take bomb to a site, clear the site, and try to get bomb down if it can reasonably be done. This is where people can start buying depending on their roles. The AWPer and buy his AWP, support and lurker start buying up on grenades, as well as the lead player can start buying his flashes. Knowing where you are on your team will determine what to buy here."

The bomb gives a huge economic boost for the Terrorists, so you don't want that to happen. You want to stop the onslaught of terrorists, but keep your encounters long range. The USP-S is a one-shot headshot from any range towards unhelmeted opponents, and terrorists cannot buy helmets first round. Split your team up, 2 going to each bombsite, and one going mid. There are some exceptions to this rule, such as on Cobblestone, in which you will probably want to consider putting 3-4 people B site, as it is an easy and common site for T's to take, and is nearly impossible to hold with just 2 players on the pistol round."

In higher-level play, the T's may rush 2-3 players one bomb site to force you to rotate, and then send the bomb and the remaining players to the other bombsite.

If you won, the Terrorists will need to save, and they absolutely need that bomb plant. You need to stop that at all costs, so buy the anti-eco weapons with high damage against unarmored opponents and high kill rewards, such as shotguns and SMGs (excluding the p90). You, again, have to stop that bomb plant at all costs. If they get the plant down, they can buy AKs the following round, and you will have competition for a point. However, if you can stave off the plant, the Terrorists will need to save again. If you did not win, you are most likely going to lose the next few rounds. You have to save up more than the Terrorists, as their supplies cost significantly less than yours. You mainly are looking for a few kills that will force the Terrorists to buy armor again, wasting their economy, and sneaking a weapon or two away if you can. You can try to buy light the third round, with Famas and SMGs, however if you lose that round, you have to save again until round 5. Your main goal is to be able to buy fully by the 4th round."

You need to win this, otherwise its back to saving for you. Stopping the bomb plant would be quite beneficial to you, however is not absolutely necessary, as if the Ts lose 3 in a row, they only get 2400, not enough to buy an AK, even with the bomb plant."

This is not change how you prepare for a round in the midgame. You don't throw your weapons away to buy SMGs or shotguns, as even if you do get a few kills with them, you will take a net loss, as the next round you have to throw that gun away and buy a rifle, as they will be fully armored by the next round.

Rush in and try to get a lucky headshot, you can cost them armor and a rifle, and if you do die it's only a few hundred dollars in their inventory.
