      "content": "Classic Slick Back In a classic slick back, the hair is left about medium-length on top. It may be tapered slightly to be a little shorter on the sides and on the back, but the length is mostly the same all over. [1] X Research source Styling tip: The classic slick-back is about as easy as it gets. To style this look, all you have to do is apply product and comb it straight back. [2] X Research source If you prefer your slick back to have a wet look, use a high-shine oil-based pomade . Where have you seen it? Michael Douglas’s character Gordon Gekko in Wall Street is an iconic example of this classic cut."

      "title": "Side Part Slick Back",
      "content": "Side Part Slick Back You don’t have to give up your side part just to wear a slick back. Keep your hair medium-length on top and slightly longer on the side opposite your part. Ask for the back and sides to be tapered so they’re shorter than the top. [3] X Research source Styling tip: Brush your hair up and back while you dry it to give it some volume, then before it’s all the way dry, comb it into a side part. [4] X Research source Where have you seen it? The side part slick back was famously worn by Don Draper of Mad Men, played by Jon Hamm."

      "title": "Center Part Slick Back",
      "content": "Center Part Slick Back The center part slick back is the perfect blend of put-together style and effortless cool. Sometimes called the middle part slick back, slicked-back Eboy haircut, or slick back with curtain fringe, this is a more relaxed version of the classic slick back. [5] X Research source Styling tip: To keep this style looking modern, use light hold pomade or gel and comb your hair so it’s just lightly pushed back, falling behind your ears."

    {
      "title": "Slick Back with Undercut",
      "content": "Slick Back with Undercut If you’re looking for a look that’s bold and edgy but still put together, the slick back with undercut might be for you. This style features a sharp transition between the longer, slicked-back top and the very short back and sides, with no fade or taper. [6] X Research source Styling tip: Depending on how close you cut the sides, you’ll probably need to see your barber or stylist for a touch-up every 2–3 weeks. [7] X Research source Where have you seen it? Brad Pitt wore a slicked-back disconnected undercut for his role in Fury ."

    {
      "title": "Slick Back with High Fade",
      "content": "Slick Back with High Fade Like an undercut slick back, a high fade slick back is a sharp, bold look. In this style, the hair fades—or gradually changes length—starting around the temples and going up to the longer section on top. [8] X Research source Styling tip: To keep this look balanced, wear your hair on the shorter or mid-length side on top, and keep it in place with strong hold pomade or gel . Plan to get regular touch-ups with this style."

    {
      "title": "Slick Back with Mid Fade",
      "content": "Slick Back with Mid Fade A slick back with mid fade is a little more subtle than a high fade, but it’s still modern and cool. To get a mid fade, start the transition lower on your head—usually just above the ears. [9] X Research source Styling tip: A mid fade looks best with slightly longer hair on top."
    },
    {
      "title": "Slick Back with Low Fade",
      "content": "Slick Back with Low Fade A slick back with low fade is the most subtle fade, so it’s great if you want the clean-cut look of a slick back and the neatness of a fade, but you want something a little more conservative than a high fade or undercut. [10] X Research source Styling tip: Have regular trims to keep the hair neat around your ears and at the back of your neck."

      "title": "Slick Back Burst Fade",
      "content": "Slick Back Burst Fade In a burst fade , your hair is faded in a C-shape behind each ear. It’s super trendy and looks great combined with the classic appeal of a slick back. Styling tip: Since the hair will be left longer in the back, keep the slick back portion a little shorter overall, and consider adding texture to the top."

    {
      "title": "Slick Back with Taper",
      "content": "Slick Back with Taper A taper is similar to a fade , but the length gradually tapers down to shorter hair instead of dropping your hair all the way down to skin length. Tapers are less edgy than fades, so they’re a good option when you want something a little more versatile. [11] X Research source Styling tip: Talk to your stylist to determine whether a high taper, mid taper, or low taper will work best with your hair type and face shape. Ask for a taper fade if you want the length of a taper but still want to take it a little shorter around the edges."

      "title": "Slick Back with Pompadour",
      "content": "Slick Back with Pompadour For a modern take on the pompadour , wear your hair up and back, styled with matte products to avoid too much shine. This is a little more high-maintenance than some other slick backs, but it’s stylish and cool if you have the time to make it happen. [12] X Research source Styling tip: Blow-dry your hair up and slightly forward with a round brush, then apply mousse , comb the hair back (but maintain the volume), smooth on a little matte pomade , then spritz on some hairspray for extra hold. Where have you seen it? This look is one of David Beckham’s most iconic styles."

      "title": "Slick Back with Quiff",
      "content": "Slick Back with Quiff A quiff is a little more relaxed than a pompadour—it still has volume on top, but it’s not combed quite as precisely. This is a good option for a slick back if you want to elongate a round face. Styling tip: Hair stylist Martin Nepton says, “To style a quiff, use a volume mousse and blow your hair out with a hairdryer and a flat brush. If you want even more volume, use a round brush, but keep in mind that the style will be very round at the top.”"

      "title": "Textured Slick Back",
      "content": "Textured Slick Back In a textured slick back, your barber or stylist will use a razor or scissors to add subtle layers to your hair. This will give the slicked-back portion a casual, less structured look. [13] X Research source Styling tip: Use a texturizing spray or matte clay to enhance your hair’s texture—but opt for products with light hold to keep the look natural."

      "title": "Mid-Length Slick Back Flow",
      "content": "Mid-Length Slick Back Flow A mid-length slick back is perfect for wearing your hair a little longer while embracing your natural texture. For the most part, keep your hair about the same length, wearing it long enough to hit about the back of your neck. But if you’d like, you can ask your barber or stylist to shape it a little around the sides for a more flattering look. [14] X Research source Styling tip: This style looks better if you let your hair have some natural movement, so opt for light-hold products ."

      "title": "Long Slick Back Flow",
      "content": "Long Slick Back Flow The long slick back flow is a great way to add a little structure to your hair once it’s about collar length. Products help hold your hair in place and control fluffiness, but you still get the natural, carefree look that makes long hair so appealing. [15] X Research source Styling tip: Wear it pushed back from your head, but stick to light-hold products like serums to avoid making your hair look greasy or weighed down. Where have you seen it? Jake Gyllenhaal has been seen sporting a long slick back flow, and we love it!"

      "title": "Wavy Slick Back Flow",
      "content": "Wavy Slick Back Flow If you have naturally wavy hair, wear it in a loose slick back for a flowing, relaxed style. This look is polished without being overdone, and it’s a great way to show off your hair’s natural movement. [16] X Research source Styling tip: Work in a texturizing product like sea salt spray to add definition to your waves, then add a dab of lightweight pomade for hold."

      "title": "Curly Slick Back",
      "content": "Curly Slick Back It can be hard to style curly hair into a slick back—the trick is to work with your hair’s natural texture instead of fighting against it. Talk to your barber or stylist about the best way to shape your curls for a slick back. Keep the style a little loose, and if possible, opt for products designed to help define and tame curls. [17] X Research source Styling tip: Work in a texturizing product for curls , then dry your hair with a diffuser . Once your hair is mostly dry, use a strong hold pomade , then style your hair with your fingers."

      "content": "Slick Back Man Bun If your style is low-maintenance and effortlessly cool, try rocking a slick back man bun . It can take about a year to grow your hair out for a man bun, but once it’s long enough, there’s not much more to it—just smooth your hair back into a loose bun and you’re ready to go. [18] X Research source Style tip: Avoid heavy styling products that can make your hair look greasy. Instead, work in a little leave-in conditioner after you wash your hair to tame frizz. Also, avoid tying your bun too tight, or it could damage your hair over time."

      "title": "Slick Back with Mohawk",
      "content": "Slick Back with Mohawk If your mohawk isn’t right for the occasion—or you just want a break from spiking it up—try slicking it back instead. Similar to a slick back undercut, you’ll have a distinct separation between the longer section on top and the shorter section on the back and sides. The only real difference is that a mohawk is narrower on top."

      "content": "Start with clean, damp hair. Your slick back will look flat if your hair is greasy or if there’s old product in it, so start by shampooing your hair. Towel-dry it or let it air dry for a few minutes so it’s not sopping wet, but don’t wait too long—your hair will hold its shape better if it’s still damp when you start styling it.

      "title": "Add about a dime-sized amount of product.",
      "content": "Add about a dime-sized amount of product. Most guys like to use product before they start styling their slick back. Exactly how much you’ll use will depend on the product you’re using and your hair’s thickness and length. Stylist Janet Miranda recommends rubbing the product between your hands to warm it up so it doesn’t clump in your hair. Here are some of the products that are best for slick backs: Thickening spray : Use this as a pre-treatment if you have thinner hair, especially if you want more volume. Pomade : Hair stylist Steven Waldman says, “Pomade stays malleable and flexible, so it’s a good option when you want some style support but you still want to run your fingers through your hair.” Oil-based pomades are shinier with stronger hold, while water-based pomades give you a more natural matte finish. Matte clay : Matte clay adds extra texture and volume to your hair, without adding shine. It’s a good option if you’re going with a pompadour or just want a little extra volume on top. Gel : Gel provides strong hold, so it’s a good option for thick or curly hair that doesn’t like to stay slicked back."

      "content": "Brush your hair back while you dry it for more structure. If your hair is naturally straight and you don’t have much trouble keeping it in a slick back style, you may not need to blow-dry it. But if your hair is especially long, thick, or stubborn, run a paddle brush or vent brush through your hair to slick it back. With each pass, follow the brush closely with the nozzle of the hair dryer. For more hold: Stop when your hair is about 80% dry and add a little more product. Then, either finish blow-drying it or let it air-dry. [20] X Research source For a more natural look: Dry your hair first, then add a little product for hold. [21] X Research source If your hair tends to fall during the day: Brush the hair closest to your temples up and back as you dry it. This will help provide support for the top portion of the haircut.

To find your face shape, compare the width of your forehead, cheekbones, and jawline. Here are some of the best slick backs for each face shape: Oval face: Your face has natural symmetry, so any slick back will work Round face: Go with a slick back with volume on top, like a pompadour, or sharp lines, like a high fade, undercut, or side part. Square face: Choose a softer slick back that shows off your angular jaw, like a classic or low fade. Rectangular/Oblong face: Opt for a style that adds volume to the sides, like a long or wavy slick back. Heart-shaped face: Add volume in a way that will balance out your face—try a classic or mid-length slick back."
