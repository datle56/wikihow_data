      "content": "Pick 5 numbers between 1-69 and 1 number between 1-26. Though Powerball tickets vary slightly from state to state, the basic method to fill one out is the same. On your ticket, pick the numbers you want to bet on and the number of drawings you want to add. Follow these guidelines to fill out a ticket: [1] X Research source Choose 5 white ball numbers between 1 and 69 . Select 1 red Powerball number between 1 and 26 . Fill in the “QP” space to select random numbers instead of choosing numbers. \"QP\" stands for \"Quick Pick\"—this lets the computer randomly choose numbers for you. Fill out more than 1 board if you want to play with new numbers . Most Powerball tickets come with 5 possible games you can play (labeled board A through E). Each game costs $2. Choose how many drawings you want . Most tickets have a \"Multidraw\" section that allows you to pay for multiple drawings. For instance, if you want to bet on your numbers for 2 back-to-back drawings, fill in the \"2\" space. Each subsequent drawing costs $2. If you make an error on any board , fill in the \"VOID\" space for that board. Then, fill in your numbers on another board. Pay for your ticket when you’re done . The clerk calculates your ticket price based on how many boards, Power Plays, and Double Plays (described below) you select. For example, if you play 5 draws on 1 board with a Power Play and 5 without, you pay (5 × 3) + (5 × 2) = $25."

      "content": "Ask the clerk for a Quick Pick ticket as an alternative. If you don't want to fill out a lengthy Powerball ticket by hand or you don't care which numbers you bet on, you can usually ask for a Quick Pick ticket instead of the normal Powerball ticket. In this case, a computer randomly chooses your numbers for you; this is similar to filling in the \"QP\" space on a normal ticket. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Add Power Play for $1 for a shot at multiplying your winnings. In every state except California, you have the option to play Power Play on your Powerball ticket for $1 more. Power Play multiplies your winnings for all non-jackpot prizes by 2, 3, 4, 5, or 10. The Power Play multiplier is selected at random before each drawing. [3] X Research source For instance, a $4 prize can become $8, $12, $16, or $20 with Power Play. The 10x Power Play multiplier is only available if the jackpot prize is less than $150 million. In Idaho and Montana , Power Play is automatically added on to your Powerball ticket. So, each Powerball play costs $3. [4] X Research source The Power Play option is unavailable in California because state laws require that lottery prizes be paid on a pari-mutuel basis. [5] X Research source This means that lottery prizes can't be set at absolute values, but must fluctuate based on the number of tickets sold and the amount of winning tickets."

      "content": "Select Double Play for $1 for a chance to win more prizes. In some states, you can add Double Play to your ticket for $1 more. Double Play enters your same Powerball numbers in a second drawing held after the Powerball drawing. So, you have the chance of winning a Powerball prize, a Double Play prize, or both. [6] X Research source The jackpot prize for Double Play is 10 million. The other prizes range from $500,000 to $7. Double Play is only available in Colorado, Florida, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Jersey, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, and Washington. It’s also available in DC, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands."

      "content": "Understand the goal and winning combos behind Powerball. Powerball is played by drawing 6 numbers—5 white ball numbers between 1 and 69 and 1 “Powerball” number (red ball) between 1 and 26. Each ball is randomly selected by a machine during the drawing. Your ultimate goal is to match every number selected, which wins you the jackpot. However, there are other winning combinations for smaller prizes (which can be quite lucrative in their own right). [7] X Research source Note : The 5 white ball numbers do not have to be in the same order as the balls that are drawn. Winning numbers win regardless of the order they're listed in for all prizes! The media typically reports numbers from smallest to largest to make it easier to read. However, the Powerball number must match exactly. None of the white ball numbers can count in place of the Powerball number. [8] X Research source Powerball may intentionally change the number of balls in play to tweak the odds. In the past, Powerball has reduced the white count to 59 and reduced the red count from 35 to 26. [9] X Research source"

Just note that the prize amounts below represent base values—Power Play prizes are subject to a 2x, 3x, 4x, 5x, or 10x multiplier (except for jackpots, which aren't multiplied, and prizes for matching 5 white balls, which only double). The winning combinations are: [10] X Research source Matching only the red ball : $4 Matching the red ball and 1 white ball : $4 Matching the red ball and 2 white balls : $7 Matching 3 white balls : $7 Matching the red ball and 3 white balls : $100 Matching 4 white balls : $100 Matching the red ball and 4 white balls : $50,000 Matching 5 white balls : $1,000,000 Matching the red ball and 5 white balls : Jackpot! The jackpot starts at a minimum of $20 million. Note : Prizes differ in California because state law requires lottery prizes to be awarded on a pari-mutuel basis (where the payout depends on the pool of bets, instead of a fixed payout).

Power Play and Double Play cost $1 extra for each game you play. For example, if you play 2 boards and select Power Play for 1 board, your ticket costs $5.

Simply check the Powerball results on Powerball’s website or your state’s lottery website. Most local news stations broadcast the numbers on TV, too. [14] X Research source Stores where Powerball tickets are sold also post the most recent draws. Your Powerball ticket is only valid for the next drawing unless you pay for multiple drawings. In other words, if your ticket doesn't win, it's not eligible for future drawings. Powerball ticket sales are usually cut off 1 to 2 hours before each drawing. For instance, if you want to play for Monday’s drawing, you need to buy your ticket by 8 or 9 pm on Monday. The more drawings that occur without a jackpot winner, the higher the jackpot gets. Jackpots start at a minimum of $20 million and increase each time a drawing occurs without a jackpot winner."

      "content": "Choose a lump sum or annuity payout option if you win the jackpot. Congratulations, you won the jackpot! The only question remaining before you retire is this: how would you like your money? Powerball jackpot winners have 2 options for receiving their cash—receive the entire prize at once in a lump sum, or receive it in yearly installments (called annuity). [20] X Research source Taking the cash as a lump sum gives you lots of money upfront, so it may be a good idea if you have a dream purchase or investment you'd like to make immediately. The annuity option invests the cash winnings and gives you your first installment immediately. You then get subsequent payments each year for 29 years (plus interest), which may be a better option for long-term stability. Choosing which prize to take is a complicated decision that depends on your personal financial situation and goals. Note: Powerball winnings are subject to federal and/or state income taxes . Because of this, the annuity option typically nets you more money in the long term—not only will you receive interest on your winnings, but each year you'll only have to pay taxes on about 1/30 of your total prize. This means more of your prize is taxed at a lower bracket. If you choose the lump sum payment, you can expect to pay up to about half of your winnings in taxes, depending on your state's income tax rules. [21] X Research source If you are not a U.S. citizen and you win a substantial jackpot, the IRS deducts a flat rate of 30% from your winnings. U.S. citizens are subject to a 25% initial deduction, plus state taxation. [22] X Research source"
