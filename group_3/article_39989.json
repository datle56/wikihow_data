      "title": "Purchase a ticket to a different movie.",
      "content": "Purchase a ticket to a different movie. Go to the ticket stand and purchase a ticket for a film rated G, PG, or PG-13 that’s playing around the same time as the R-rated movie you want to see. Pay the ticket seller and thank them before you head to your auditorium. If the auditorium numbers are listed for each movie, buy a ticket for a movie that’s being shown right next door to the R-rated movie."

    {
      "title": "Give your ticket to the ticket taker.",
      "content": "Give your ticket to the ticket taker. Try to go to the ticket taker when they’re in a hurry and have a lot of people in line. Once you’re ready to go in and enjoy your movie, walk over to the ticket taker. Give them your ticket like you normally would so they can check it. Stay relaxed when you’re near the ticket-taker so it doesn’t seem obvious that you’re trying to get into a different movie."

    {
      "title": "Go into the auditorium where the R-rated movie is playing.",
      "content": "Go into the auditorium where the R-rated movie is playing. Walk by the ticket taker and follow a crowd of people to avoid being noticed. Instead of going into the movie you bought the ticket for, just casually slip into the theater with the R-rated movie you actually want to see. If you want to make it less obvious, go to the bathroom or concessions first before going into the auditorium. Try to join a crowd of people entering the theater so you blend in with everyone. If your theater makes you choose your seat ahead of time, check the app or website to see which seats are still available a few minutes before showtime. Otherwise, try to sit near the front rows because they’re normally empty."

      "title": "Avoid employees at the theater entrance.",
      "content": "Avoid employees at the theater entrance. Sometimes, movie theaters have employees guard the entrance to auditoriums showing R-rated movies so they can check IDs. If you see an employee by the entrance, change your plan and enter the auditorium showing the movie you bought the ticket for. Wait a minute or two and then walk through the lobby again to see if the employee is still there. Walk in as soon as you know that they’re gone, which may be a couple minutes after the movie starts playing. Try not to make it obvious that you’re walking through the lobby for this reason. You might blend in more if you scope out the auditorium entrance on your way to the restroom or concession stand."

    {
      "title": "Order the movie ticket online or at a self-serve kiosk.",
      "content": "Order the movie ticket online or at a self-serve kiosk. Many theaters let you buy your tickets ahead of time or without talking to an employee. Search online for the theater and movie and purchase the tickets ahead of time. Otherwise, go to one of the kiosks near the box office and purchase the ticket to the movie there. That way, you only have to interact with the ticket-taker. If you want to still play it safe, get a ticket to a different movie playing at the same time as the R-rated one."

      "title": "Go see the movie with some older friends.",
      "content": "Go see the movie with some older friends. If you’re friends with people who are 17 and older, ask them to go to the movie with you. Try to dress and act like them so you blend in and don’t stand out as being younger than them. The employees selling or taking tickets may assume that you’re all the same age and let you into the movie without checking your IDs first. Some theater chains may also let you see R-rated movies if you’re with at least one person who is 17 or older."

    {
      "title": "Pretend like you forgot your ID if you’re asked.",
      "content": "Pretend like you forgot your ID if you’re asked. If an employee asks for your ID before walking into the theater, play it off like you forgot it at home. If the employee still doesn’t let you in, try explaining that you already bought the ticket and that you’re going to be late for the movie to try convincing them to let you in. You may also pretend that your parents or friends were already let inside and that you need to catch up with them. If the employee still doesn’t let you inside, then it’s best to ask for a ticket to a different movie at the box office or to try again on a different day."

      "title": "Tell employees your parents are already inside the theater.",
      "content": "Tell employees your parents are already inside the theater. If someone questions you walking into an R-rated movie, try to stay calm and collected so you don’t look guilty of sneaking in. Instead, pretend that you were just running to the bathroom and that your parents are already waiting in their seats."

      "title": "Go to the theater when a friend is working.",
      "content": "Go to the theater when a friend is working. If you know someone who works at the movie theater, ask them what days they’re on the clock. Try to see a movie when your friend is at the ticket counter or taking tickets because they could let you in without checking your ID."

      "title": "See the movie with a parent or guardian if they allow it.",
      "content": "See the movie with a parent or guardian if they allow it. If your parents are okay with you seeing an R-rated movie, it might be easiest to ask them if they want to go with you. They could also help your friends get tickets, and then you could just sit far away from them in the theater. If your parent doesn’t want to see the movie, they may be able to buy a ticket and give it to you. If a parent won’t allow it, then ask an older brother or sister if they want to see the movie with you."

      "title": "Ask someone to pose as a parent or guardian.",
      "content": "Ask someone to pose as a parent or guardian. Look around for an adult who looks at least 21 years old. Politely ask them if they could buy your ticket and if you can walk into the theater together. You can always offer to pay them back for the ticket or get concessions for them to thank them for helping you out. You can also try giving the person a little extra cash to help you out, but don’t offer more than $5-10 USD. If an adult asks for more money than that, it’s possible that they’re trying to scam you. Avoid being pushy and find another adult if the person feels uncomfortable getting your ticket."

      "content": "Dress and act more maturely when you go to the theater. Avoid wearing clothes that are more trendy for young people, and instead dress a little nicer. [1] X Research source Keep your cool, and try your best not to giggle or act silly so employees don’t think you’re underage. If you look like you’re old enough, a theater employee may sell you a ticket to an R-rated movie without asking for your ID. Wear a shirt with a university or college logo to make it seem more like you’re over 18. Remember that simply wearing a university or college logo shirt is not restricted to people over 18 or attending that college or university. A person that is in middle school or high school may wear the shirt because they simply like the shirt, or it could be a hand me down/freebie. If you’re able to grow facial hair, don't shave for at least a week before you see the movie to help you appear older. Try to have more \"adult\" conversations while waiting in line at the lobby. It is best to talk about work, the weather, current events, community happenings, finances/taxes, etc."

      "content": "Yes, you can see an R-rated movie by yourself when you’re 17. When films are rated R, they have more adult material that’s inappropriate for younger children. If you’re 17 or under, then most theaters require you to see the movie with an adult. Once you turn 17, you’re able to go see any movie on your own. [2] X Research source Even if you’re 17 or older, theater chains may not let you buy tickets for your younger friends."

If you’re caught in a different theater than the movie you paid for, theater employees may approach you and ask for your ticket. If you’re not able to show them the correct ticket, they may escort you to the correct theater or kick you out without a refund."

While sneaking into a different movie usually isn’t a big problem, some theaters can claim you’re stealing services by not seeing the movie you paid for. If the theater wants to take legal action, you could have to pay a fine. [3] X Research source"
