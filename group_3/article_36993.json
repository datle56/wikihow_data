      "title": "Examine the original fitting and bulb.",
      "content": "Examine the original fitting and bulb. Most halogen downlights fit into the power supply with small pegs or pins. Check the bottom of the existing bulb to see how the connectors should look, then use a ruler to check the size of the fitting as well as the size of the cut-out for the bulb. Be sure to reference this information as you’re shopping for LED bulbs. You may be able to find the size of the fitting printed somewhere on the socket. If your bulb has a twist-and-lock fitting with two prongs on the bottom, it’s most likely a 240-volt GU10 bulb, and generally has a 50mm fitting. These can usually be switched for LED bulbs without replacing any parts. If the bulb has 2 sharp pins and pushes into the fitting, it is likely a low-voltage MR11 or MR16 bulb. These 12-volt bulbs require a transformer if you’re using them in place of a halogen bulb."

      "content": "Look at the base of the globe for the wattage. Each halogen bulb should be printed with the wattage that it uses, or the amount of power that the bulb consumes when it’s turned on. Since LED bulbs use far less power than halogen bulbs, they will not have the same wattage rating. However, most LED bulbs list their equivalent wattage on the packaging. If you can’t find the information on the packaging, you can estimate the equivalent wattage. LED bulbs generally use about 10% of the power of their halogen counterparts, so a 5-6 watt LED would be roughly equivalent to a 50 watt halogen bulb. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Choose a bulb that's around 650-700 lumens to match most halogen bulbs. Lumens measure the light output of a bulb, so this is the number you should match to ensure you get the same effect from your LED bulb as you did from the halogen bulb. Average halogen bulbs are between 650-700 lumens, but you may have different needs for customized lighting effects. If your downlights are used to light a workspace area, you will probably need higher lumens. If your downlights create soft ambient lighting in a gallery space, you might prefer lower lumens."

      "content": "Choose a color temperature between 2700-3000K for warm light. Most people think of bluish lights when they think of LEDs, but they are available in a wide range of color temperatures. Lower numbers are warmer, while higher numbers are cooler. If you prefer the warm glow of a typical halogen bulb, look for LED bulbs in the 2700-3000K range. In the home, these lights are popular in living and bedroom areas."

      "content": "Choose dimming LED bulbs if you have a dimmer switch. If you like to adjust the brightness of your lights depending on the time of day, you can opt for LED bulbs that work with a dimmer. Most LED bulbs will work with your existing dimmer. However, in some cases, you may have to change the dimmer to a low-voltage version. To replace the dimmer switch, turn off the power to the switch, then unscrew the switch plate and remove it. Pull the switch out of the electrical box and remove the wires, then reattach the wires to the new dimmer switch. Push the new switch into the electrical box and replace the switch plate.

Dispose of the old bulb by throwing it into the trash. While it’s safe to throw halogen bulbs in with your regular garbage, compact fluorescent lights (CFLs) and fluorescent tubes contain mercury and should be treated like hazardous waste. If you have any of these you need to dispose of, check to see if there is a drop-off location in your area where you can take light bulbs that contain mercury."

      "content": "Find the transformer's minimum and maximum load rating in VA or Watts. This information should be printed somewhere on the body of the transformer, and it may be either a fixed number or a range. [10] X Research source If the transformer lists a range, it is an electronic one (20 and 70 in the picture). The bottom number is the minimum load required for the transformer to function, and the top number is the maximum allowable. If there is only one number, the total power consumption of your bulbs on the transformer should be below the transformer maximum load rating and the transformer will be an iron core one. Being much more efficient, your LED bulbs individually will fall well below the transformer’s maximum power range. However, if your LED bulbs do not work or not work reliably on the halogen transformer, you will have an electronic version rather than the old iron core. If you are not dimming on the circuit, it is possible to wire multiple LEDs in parallel and doing so achieve the minimum load rating of an electronic transformer. Add up the Wattage (in VA or Watts) of each bulb to find out the total power. This is a way to reuse electronic halogen transformers. Rewiring by an electrician might be an option. E.g., a room with 4 halogen transformers/light combinations could be rewired to 1 transformer with 4 LEDs."
