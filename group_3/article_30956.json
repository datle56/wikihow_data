      "content": "Your mirror soul is a perfect reflection of your own soul. The concept of mirror souls, also called “twin flames,” comes from the idea that one soul can be perfectly split in two and placed into two separate bodies. Your mirror soul is your perfect other half, and the person who makes up this other half possesses the exact same qualities as you—both good and bad. [1] X Research source People in any kind of relationship can be mirror souls, including romantic relationships, friendships, or familial relationships. Some people believe that twin flames and mirror souls don’t have to be the same person. According to these beliefs, your relationship with your twin flame is often turbulent and meant to force you to face your shadows and have a spiritual awakening. Only once you’ve had this spiritual awakening will you be ready to meet your mirror soul, who is your true other half. Unlike your twin flame, your relationship with your mirror soul will be peaceful and serene."
