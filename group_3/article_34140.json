      "content": "Take your cat to see a veterinarian. A medical issue, such as a urinary tract infection, may be causing your cat to urinate on the carpet instead of in a litter box. Before you try any other intervention to remedy the situation, you should take your cat to see a veterinarian to treat any medical issues that may be causing the behavior. Getting your cat checked out right away is important to protect the health and well-being of your pet and to prevent a long-lasting litter box aversion.

These health problems can cause litter box avoidance. Inappropriate urinations can be a medical condition and with male cats can actually be an early sign of a life-threatening blockage.

      "content": "Clean accidents with an enzymatic cleaner. Cleaning up accidents right after they happen will also help deter your cat from using the same spot again. Use an enzymatic cleaner rather than an ammonia based one. Ammonia-based cleaners may cause your cat to urinate more often on the spot because she may interpret the ammonia as another cat’s urine that she must cover up with her own urine.

Some rugs may be beyond cleaning if the messes were not taken care of right away. Get rid of rugs that have been soiled repeatedly by your cat."

Negative associations with the litter box may be improved by doing things like playing with your cat around the litter box. Try playing with your cat a few feet away from her box a few times per day to help her generate more positive feelings about the litter box. Do not try to reward your cat for using the litter box by giving her treats. Cats don’t like to be disturbed while they use the litter box. You can leave treats and toys near your cat’s litter box, but do not keep your cat’s food and water dish next to her box. Cats don’t like to eat too close to where they use the bathroom."

Some veterinarians undergo special training to help people deal with problems such as urinating outside of the box.

Cats may avoid using the litter box because they dislike the smell or texture of the litter, or because the litter is too deep. A shallow bed of medium to fine grain clumping litter is best, but you can also try offering your cat different types of litter to see what she prefers. Give your cat a choice of litter types by placing two litter boxes with two different types of litter right next to each other. At the end of the day, check to see which one your cat used. Provide a shallow bed of litter. Most cats prefer a litter box that has about 1–2 inches (3–5 cm) of litter."

Your cat may still associate the litter box with pain and want to avoid it. Feline interstitial cystitis is another common cause of litter box aversion. Cats with feline interstitial cystitis may urinate in the litter box because they feel the need to urinate more often. Kidney stones or a blockage of your cat’s urinary tract may also result in a litter box aversion. Your cat may meow or howl while using the box and the fear of pain may continue even after treatment. Keep in mind that prompt treatment of these conditions is essential so that your cat does not develop a long lasting litter box aversion."
