      "content": "Go old school with this tried and true classic. It might seem basic, but people don't always get much of a chance to talk about themselves. Let the other person know you're genuinely interested in what they have going on, and hopefully, they'll feel comfortable opening up. You might find out that they've been working on a cool new project, or they might share that they're having a hard time—whatever they say, build on it by asking follow-up questions. If it doesn't lead anywhere, move on to something else. [1] X Research source Remember to ask open-ended questions the other person can elaborate on, rather than questions that can be answered \"yes\" or \"no.\" For instance, it's better to ask, \"What did you do today?\" instead of, \"Did you have a good day?\""

      "title": "Follow up on something they said earlier.",
      "content": "Follow up on something they said earlier. One great way to revive a conversation is to circle back to something the other person already mentioned. You already know they're interested in talking about it, so ask them for a little more detail. That will show you're a good listener —and when you're interested in the person you're talking to, you automatically seem more interesting too. [2] X Research source Try asking something like, \"What did you end up choosing for dinner earlier? Was it any good?\" You might also say, \"I meant to ask, but you said something about planning a trip next weekend. Where are you heading?\""

      "title": "Liven up the conversation while getting some recommendations.",
      "content": "Liven up the conversation while getting some recommendations. If you're not sure what to talk about next, try digging into what the other person is reading, watching, or listening to. If you've never heard of whatever they bring up, ask them to tell you a little more about it. [3] X Research source This is especially great if they mention they've been spending a lot of time at home watching TV, reading books, or listening to podcasts. Just say something like, \"I've been wanting to get into podcasts. Where should I start?\" or \"I need a new show to binge-watch, any suggestions?\""

[4] X Expert Source Julia McCurley Certified Professional Matchmaker Expert Interview. 30 September 2021. But always make sure to ask first—the other person might not be too happy if you accidentally spoil something for them! If the other person has seen the episode, ask them about their thoughts, or share your own theories about what might be happening. This works with just about anything you have in common, not just TV shows—you can also talk about movies, books, podcasts, games, and more."

      "title": "Jump-start the conversation by asking the other person's opinion.",
      "content": "Jump-start the conversation by asking the other person's opinion. Most people are more than happy to share their opinions about things. Use that to your advantage by posing a question that gives your pal the opportunity to tell you what they really think. Just avoid anything too serious—political and religious debates can get pretty heated, and it's easy to misinterpret tone over text. To be on the safe side, opt for something a little more lighthearted. [5] X Research source Try saying something like, \"Okay, I need your serious opinion. Be honest. Waffles, pancakes, or French toast? There's only one right answer.\""

      "content": "Take the lead by talking about yourself for a bit. Don't feel like you constantly have to push the other person to talk about themselves—too much of that, and they might start to feel like they're being interrogated. If you need a pivot, talk about something interesting you've done recently. Hopefully, your chat partner will pick up the thread and ask you a couple of follow-up questions! [6] X Research source For example, you might talk about something cool you learned in school, tell a funny story , or mention that it's the third day in a row you saw a rainbow. If you haven't done much, try talking about something that's going on around you. Maybe your kid sister is dyeing your dog purple, or maybe you have new neighbors moving in, for instance. You never know what will spark a conversation, so don't be afraid to throw out something random!"

McCurley says that if the conversation has stalled, try dropping in something you've always liked about them. [7] X Expert Source Julia McCurley Certified Professional Matchmaker Expert Interview. 30 September 2021. Even a casual compliment might encourage them to open up to you a little more. [8] X Research source For instance, you might share something you really appreciate about them by saying something like, \"You always make me feel better when I'm down. You're the best!\" or \"I miss your amazing smile.\" [9] X Research source You might also mention something of theirs you really like, such as, \"I meant to ask you where you got that awesome jacket you were wearing the other day.

      "content": "Get a little flirty if you're chatting with a crush. If you've already been flirty in the conversation, it's likely okay to continue to be flirty. However, if the other person hasn't been overtly flirty with you, be cautious in what you say. If they don't seem to be reciprocating the same suggestive vibes as you, don't keep pressing—being too flirty might actually push them away. If you just got out of the shower, McCurley suggests saying something like, \"I just got out of the shower, and I was thinking about you.\" [10] X Expert Source Julia McCurley Certified Professional Matchmaker Expert Interview. 30 September 2021. If you don't want to be too forward, try saying something like, \"I just saw an ad for this new movie that made me think of you instantly.\" It could spark a conversation, and it could even lead to an opportunity to invite that person out to see the movie."

      "content": "Draw them in with a cliffhanger. Sometimes it takes a little encouragement to get someone really engaged in a conversation. Try amping up their interest by leaving them wondering what you're going to say next. Just make sure your follow-up is strong so they don't feel let down! [11] X Research source If you have a great story to share, open by saying something like, \"The craziest thing happened at work today,\" or \"You'll never guess who I saw!\" This can also be a fun way to let the other person know you're thinking of them. If you're eating at a restaurant you know they love, for instance, you might say, \"Guess where I am right now!\" (Bonus points if you offer to bring them take-out.)"

If you're texting someone you don't know super-well, but you're pretty comfortable with each other, try asking questions to find out what they were like as a kid. This can tell you a lot about the person, from what their family life was like to what's important to them now. Just keep in mind that childhood memories can be tied to a lot of emotion, so try not to pry if something seems to be a little touchy. [12] X Research source Try asking lighthearted questions like, \"Who was your favorite Disney princess growing up?\" or \"Did you have any awesome holiday traditions as a kid?\""

It could be a long-lost inside joke between you and your oldest friend, or it could be something silly the waiter said when you were on a date the weekend before. Just make sure it's something you both find funny—the other person might get annoyed if you're laughing about something they thought was embarrassing. [13] X Research source If you can't think of anything, try sharing a funny meme with the person instead!"

If you don't censor yourself, you might just come up with something super interesting. And as a bonus, you'll get to find out whether the other person vibes with your own personal brand of weirdness.

      "content": "Switch things up by calling the person. If you feel like texting isn't quite giving you everything you want, see if the other person is up to talk on the phone or chat on a face-to-face video call. You can pick up on a lot more nuance that way, and it's a great option if you want to talk about something more in-depth than text can offer. [15] X Research source If the other person says they can't talk because they're busy, you'll understand more about why the text conversation was starting to slow down!"

      "content": "Invite the other person to meet up so you can continue the convo in person. The other person might not be texting you back right away because they're busy, but they might be open to hanging out in person when they have some free time. You can then continue the conversation there. However, if you haven't met up with this person before, you likely want to avoid this option—asking someone you don't know well to meet up might creep them out, and this could lead to them not wanting to talk to you at all anymore. Try saying something like, \"If you're busy right now, maybe we could meet up later for some coffee and a chat!\" You also don't even have to mention the conversation at all. Simply ask something like, \"Wanna grab a bite to eat later?\" If they agree, this will give the conversation a chance to lull naturally until you meet up in person. If the other person ends up declining the invite, don't take it personally. The other person might be busy, or they might not be in the mood to meet up. If this is the case, it's probably best to [#\"Talk to you later!\"|let the conversation end for now], and you can start up a new one later."

      "content": "Wait a while before you text the person anything. Sometimes when a text conversation slows down, it's because the other person is busy or bored of texting. Or, they might have something on their mind. Instead of trying to fill every moment of silence, give the other person some space so they can decide whether they want to take the lead in the conversation or just take a break for a bit. You don't necessarily have to go full-on ghost, and don't turn it into a waiting game where you don't text the person back for exactly 17-and-a-half minutes. Just find something else to do for a little while and see if the other person is still feeling chatty."

If the person you're texting is sending you short responses or lagging a lot between messages, they might be ready to take a break from texting. Instead of leaving things open-ended, give things a clear end with a friendly \"Bye!\" This will also make it easier to pop back in with a fresh conversation a day or two later. [16] X Research source If your text conversations usually seem like they don't go anywhere, you and the other person might just not be connecting. That's totally fine—not everyone has to be interested in you. Focus your energy on the people who do want to spend time talking to you! [17] X Research source"
