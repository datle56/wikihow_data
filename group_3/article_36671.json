      "content": "Push-pull stopper Raise the drain stopper up. Then, if there’s a knob, twist it counterclockwise to unscrew it from the stopper. Set the knob aside and look inside the opening for the fastener. If there is one, unscrew it to remove the central stem and lift the entire assembly out. If there isn’t, use pliers to grip the stem underneath the stopper and slowly increase the amount of force you use until the whole thing pops out. [1] X Research source Depending on the design of the stopper, you may have a screw on the underside of the stopper. If you can’t remove the stopper with force or using the fastener on top, try removing the screw on the underside."

    {
      "title": "Pop-up stopper",
      "content": "Pop-up stopper Use the lift rod to raise the drain stopper up. Then, try unscrewing the top of the drain stopper. If it comes loose, continue unscrewing and pull the entire assembly out. If it doesn’t come loose, look for a screw or nut directly underneath the top of the cover. Remove that with a screwdriver or wrench and disassemble the entire drain. [2] X Research source Pop-up drains are identical to the pop-up drains you find in most modern sinks, but the stopper lever lift rod is located in the wall of the tub under the faucet—not behind the faucet like you’d find on a sink."

    {
      "title": "Lift and turn stopper",
      "content": "Lift and turn stopper Grasp the stopper and pull up on it. You should see a set screw underneath the stopper’s cap. Use your screwdriver to remove this, and the stopper should then come out. Tap or nudge it with the screwdriver if it seems stuck. [3] X Research source Lift-and-turn drains will also have a stopper in the center of the drain, but will be activated by grasping and turning them."
    },
    {
      "title": "Trip lever stopper",
      "content": "Trip lever stopper Remove the faceplate of the trip lever drain. Set your tub to the “open” position, if it has a visible stopper. Remove any screws you see on the drain’s faceplate. Once the screws are out, you should be able to lift up on the drain and pull it out. [4] X Research source The faceplate will be on the tub wall near the faucet, not on the bottom of the tub with the drain. These drains will stop a tub when a trip lever is activated. You may not be able to see the stopper itself when looking at the drain. Set the tip of the screwdriver underneath the lip of the loosened drain if you need some leverage as you pull it out. Make sure to pull away from the tub wall. The plunger (a small piece that stops the tub) should come out along with the drain."

    {
      "title": "Flip-it stopper",
      "content": "Flip-it stopper Use the little flip lever to set the drain to the open position (so that water flows through). Then, grab the lever firmly with one hand and twist the entire drain stopper with the other. Use a wrench or channel locks if you need to. The stopper will eventually pop right out of the drain. [5] X Research source Flip-it drain stoppers are much more popular in Europe and Canada than they are in the rest of the world."

    {
      "title": "Toe touch stopper",
      "content": "Toe touch stopper Put on your rubber gloves and grasp the center stopper. Turn it counterclockwise while pulling up slightly. After enough turns, the stopper should unscrew fully from the drain. Foot plug drains will have a stopper in the center of the drain that moves up and down when the tub is stopped."

      "content": "Try prying the drain basket out with pliers. If you’re lucky, this should be very easy. Grab some needle-nose pliers and grip whatever appears to be the most structurally intact portion of the drain. Gently tug and twist the drain. If you can feel some give, continue increasing pressure until the drain comes free. [6] X Research source If you see any screws on the drain, remove those first."

      "content": "Use a drain removal tool if you need more force. Go through the various heads that came with a drain removal tool until you find one that fits your drain perfectly. It must slip into the basket and onto the crossbars that are at the bottom of the basket. [7] X Research source A drain wrench (also called a smart dumbbell) usually has several heads of different shapes/sizes to fit into a variety of drains."

      "content": "Unscrew the drain basket by turning the tool counterclockwise. Grasp your drain wrench and turn it counterclockwise. This may be tough, but keep going. If you need more torque, try placing a strong screwdriver across the drain wrench’s handle so you have a little more to hold on to. Once the basket loosens up, remove it by continuing to turn it counterclockwise. [8] X Research source"

Turn your hair dryer on “hot” or “warm” and let it blow on the drain basket (where the stopper was) for a few minutes. The basket, also known as a flange, is sealed with plumber’s putty. Warming it up will make it easier to remove. [9] X Research source"

If the putty is stuck, use a plastic putty knife to loosen it. Once it’s gone, clean the drain with a cloth and a mild bathroom cleanser, soap and water, or a 50/50 mix of vinegar and baking soda. [10] X Research source If you use any vinegar to clean the drain, don’t use any commercial cleaning agents, ammonia, or bleach. The combination could create toxic fumes."

If you have a trip lever assembly, you may need to snake the assembly through from the lever to the bottom of the drain."

      "content": "Test for leaks. Activate the tub stopper or trip lever, and fill the tub halfway with water. Come back after an hour or so. If the water has not drained much, then your new drain is installed properly. You can place a piece of tape on the tub wall at the water line to make it easier to tell if any water drains out. If the water is below the piece of tape after an hour has gone by, then some water has drained out. If the tub does leak, check and make sure the new drain is sealed properly."
