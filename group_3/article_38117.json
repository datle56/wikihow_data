      "title": "Avoid palm oil and the products that contain it.",
      "content": "Avoid palm oil and the products that contain it. Palm oil is the most commonly used vegetable oil in the world, and over half of the packaged products in most supermarkets contain it. Unfortunately, expanding palm oil plantations have led to widespread rainforest deforestation. The exponential production of cheap palm oil has also endangered many species of animals, and many palm oil companies are guilty of human rights exploitation. [1] X Research source You can avoid palm oil by avoiding processed foods. Consume mostly fruits, vegetables, nuts, and grains. Read labels and avoid products that contain palm oil. Learn the sneaky names for palm oil. These include (but are not limited to): vegetable oil, palm kernel, palm kernel oil, palm fruit oil, palmitate, palmolein, glyceryl, palmate, palmitic acid, sodium laureth sulfate, sodium lauryl sulfate, stearate, stearic acid, and sodium kernelate."

      "title": "Refuse Brazilian beef.",
      "content": "Refuse Brazilian beef. About 60-70% of the deforestation in Brazil has been the result of cattle farming, and this number is rapidly growing. You can help save the rainforest by avoiding this product. If you choose to eat beef, select grass-fed options local to your region, and say no to Brazilian-raised beef. [2] X Research source Fast food chains use the majority of this beef. You can begin avoiding Brazilian beef by saying no to fast food burgers."

      "title": "Buy sustainable coffee.",
      "content": "Buy sustainable coffee. Consumption of coffee can have a negative effect on the world’s rainforests. Coffee farms, like palm oil plantations, have also led to deforestation, and have also been known for their poor working conditions and human rights violations. You can work to lessen the ongoing damage to our rainforests by selecting coffee that is sustainably farmed. [3] X Research source Look for a “Rainforest Alliance” label to show that this coffee was produced under sustainable conditions."

      "title": "Avoid paper products or buy recycled paper products.",
      "content": "Avoid paper products or buy recycled paper products. Paper products contribute directly to rainforest deforestation. Products like toilet paper, paper towels, coffee filters, notebooks, printer paper, and others are created from rainforest trees. Do your part by using reusable materials whenever possible (such as reusable coffee filters or coffee mugs). When you must use paper products, select products made from 100% recycled materials."

      "title": "Avoid wood products made from threatened rainforest woods.",
      "content": "Avoid wood products made from threatened rainforest woods. Despite the delicate state of the world’s rainforests, trees are still harvested to build guitars, furniture, and other products. Avoid products made of mahogany, rosewood, ebony, and other tropical hardwoods. Instead, opt for products made from white ash, black cherry, or maple woods. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Eat less meat.",
      "content": "Eat less meat. For every 1 ⁄ 4 pound (0.11 kg) hamburger that is produced in fast food restaurants, approximately 55 square feet (5.1 square meters) of rainforest land is destroyed. That's about the size of a small kitchen! Deforested rainforest land is being turned into grazing pasture for cows. You can help to save the rainforest by choosing to eat less meat. [5] X Research source Start by having one meat-free day each week, then expand to two days. You can make a dent by simply cutting the amount of meat you consume in half. You can make a huge contribution by choosing to live a vegetarian or vegan lifestyle."

      "title": "Reduce the amount of petroleum you use.",
      "content": "Reduce the amount of petroleum you use. Oil companies, with the intention of extracting oil from this land, have purchased much of the land in the Peruvian Amazon. When you purchase oil and other petroleum products, you support these companies and further the demand for such oil. You can help save the rainforest by reducing your use of oil. [6] X Research source Purchase a hybrid or electric car. Ride your bike instead of driving. Turn down the temperature in your house by 1 °F (−17 °C). Avoid Styrofoam, ballpoint pens, and bubble gum."

You can lend a hand by donating a bit of money to an organization of your choosing. Nation of Change, Rainforest Foundation US, and World Land Trust are just a few. If you don’t have a lot of money lying around, you can organize a lemonade stand, bake sale, or a talent show to help raise money for a funding organization."

      "content": "Participate in ecotourism. The International Ecotourism Society has defined ecotourism as \"responsible travel to natural areas that conserves the environment and improves the welfare of local people.\" [9] X Research source Whereas \"regular\" tourism tends to cause damage, ecotourism is an educational experience that works to teach individuals, protect lands, and provide monetary support for conservation efforts. Ecotourism provides funding to organizations working to help the rainforest to heal."

The “R” in the acronym stands for “restore ecosystems.” Despite the devastation already experienced by many of the world’s rainforests, these lush ecosystems are still capable of healing. In order for the rainforest to be “saved,” efforts must be made to replant lost trees, and help these delicate ecosystems recuperate. [12] X Research source One way that you can contribute aid to the restoration of the rainforest is through ecotourism. Donating to rainforest conservation organizations is another option."

      "title": "Encourage sustainable living.",
      "content": "Encourage sustainable living. The first “E” stands for “encourage sustainable living.” No amount of restoration can help the rainforests if the practices of using rainforest resources don’t change. In order to save the rainforest, farmers, companies, and individuals need to learn and embody sustainable practices. [13] X Research source You can help support these efforts by donating to a rainforest organization, or by participating in ecotourism."
