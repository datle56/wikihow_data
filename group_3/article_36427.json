      "title": "Remove pills with a disposable razor.",
      "content": "Remove pills with a disposable razor. Lay the garment on a flat surface, pulling the fabric near the affected area taut with one hand. Gently shave upward with the razor in small strokes—start with the lightest contact possible and increase as necessary. [2] X Research source Pulling the fabric taut prevents you from cutting through the garment. Once you’ve accumulated a pile of fabric pills, use tape to remove them from the fabric. Wrap a large loop of packing tape around your closed fingers (sticky side out) to lift them up. [3] X Research source Always use a sharp, new razor, which will most effectively remove the pills. Avoid using shaving razors that have moisture strips or soap bars on either side, as this will likely cause more pilling when rubbed against the fabric."

      "content": "Rub over the fabric with sandpaper . Grab a leftover sheet of sandpaper lying around your home—any grit will do. Then, lightly and carefully guide the sandpaper over the pilled surface of the fabric. In no time at all, those pesky pills will be history! You can also use a sandpaper sponge to accomplish the same thing."

      "content": "Go over the fabric with a lint brush or lint roller . Work the lint brush over the surface of the fabric, removing the pills from the material as you go. A lint roller also works well for this—simply guide the roller over the surface to get rid of the pills. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Trim away the pills with nail scissors . Lay the garment out on a flat surface, like an ironing board or your bed. Using a pair of nail scissors, pull the fabric so it’s taut and carefully trim away each pill without snipping the fabric in the process. [5] X Research source Make sure to hold the scissors close to the fabric. Work gently and slowly, so you don’t damage the material."

The rough material of the stone makes it easy to remove pilling and lint from your clothes.

      "content": "Pick off pills with Velcro hair rollers . Lay out the garment on a flat surface, setting the roller flat on the pilled area. Gently roll it over the material to lift and remove the pills from the fabric. From there, remove any pills caught in the roller and continue to any other affected areas of fabric. [8] X Research source A strip of Velcro can also work well for removing pilling from fabric. Holding the Velcro hook-side down, carefully lift the fuzz balls up and off of your garment.

Using short and quick strokes, hold the fabric taut and guide the comb in a single direction to gently scrape the pills off. [10] X Research source A sweater comb is a small, fine-toothed comb made specifically for removing pilling. It’s different from a hair comb because the teeth are smaller and closer together."

When you turn your garments inside out, there’s a better likelihood that pills will develop on the “wrong” side of your garments. The pills will still be there, but only you’ll know about them.

[14] X Expert Source Rani Gorgis Laundry & Cleaning Specialist Expert Interview. 12 April 2021. Delicate cycles are shorter and gentler, causing less abrasion in the garments. It also helps to stick your garments in a wash net, especially if they’re on the delicate side (like a bra). [15] X Research source Make sure the washer isn’t overfilled when you go to start your load, as an overstuffed washing machine can contribute to pilling.

Whenever possible, hang your garments up to dry rather than using the dryer—this causes less abrasion to the fabric and prevents pilling.

      "content": "Use liquid detergent instead of powder. Powder detergent rubs against the fabric as it dissolves, which makes it more likely to cause pilling during the washing cycle—because of this, liquid detergents are the most gentle solution for delicate fabrics. [19] X Research source Use the recommended amount of detergent that’s listed on the package, following your washer’s guidelines to pour it into the machine. Always use a gentle detergent for your wash cycles. [20] X Expert Source Rani Gorgis Laundry & Cleaning Specialist Expert Interview. 12 April 2021."

      "content": "Opt for garments made with natural materials, like linen or silk. As a general rule of thumb, synthetic materials pill more often than other materials—in other words, fabrics like polyester, nylon, acrylic, and spandex are more likely to develop pills than clothes made with natural fibers like hemp, cashmere, and silk. [22] X Research source Knitted garments are also common pilling offenders, along with materials like fleece, jersey, and wool. [23] X Research source The tighter the fabric weave, the less likely it is to pill. That’s why garments like jeans almost never pill, while a knitted clothing item often develops tons of pills.

Believe it or not, people have found that storing their sweaters in the freezer rather than the closet helps keep their garments from shedding fibers and stops them from pilling. If you have enough room in your freezer, try sticking your sweaters in there and see if you notice a difference. [25] X Research source"
