Here's what you'll need: Power Gems, 5 pieces Lucid Gems, 5 pieces Thunder Gems, 5 pieces Mystery Goo, 3 pieces Gale, 3 pieces"

      "title": "Gather 5 Power Gems.",
      "content": "Gather 5 Power Gems. Power Gems drop from almost every heartless in Neverland, so they are very easy to get. Here's what to do: Go to Neverland (Peter Pan's world). Warp to the cabin and exit the only door, which leads to the deck. Kill all the heartless on the deck (Pirates, Air Pirates, and Battleships). Once you have 5 pieces of Power Gems, head back to the cabin and exit Neverland."

      "title": "Gather 5 Lucid Gems.",
      "content": "Gather 5 Lucid Gems. Lucid Gems are a bit harder to get and may require a bit of patience. Here's how to get them: Warp to Halloween Town (Jack Skellington's world) and land at Guillotine Gate. Exit the only door in this area, which will lead you to Guillotine Square. Head northwest until you see a small alley with a staircase. Enter the gate at the top of the staircase, which will take you to the graveyard. At the graveyard a number of enemies will spawn. Target Wight Knights (mummy-looking heartless) and Gargoyles (flying humanoid bird heartless). You can go back to Guillotine Gate, then reenter the graveyard to make these heartless spawn again. Once you have 5 pieces of Lucid Gems, go back to Guillotine Gate and exit Halloween Town."

    {
      "title": "Gather 5 Thunder Gems.",
      "content": "Gather 5 Thunder Gems. Gathering Thunder Gems can also be tricky because few heartless drop them. So: Warp to Atlantica (Little Mermaid's world) and land at Triton's throne. Head south to the only exit, which will lead you to Triton's palace. Head north, and you will see Screwdivers (heartless that carry tridents or three-pronged spears) and an Aquatank (heartless that look like large Anglerfish). Kill them to get Thunder Gems. Head to the Undersea Gorge, which is directly north from where you came. More Screwdivers and Aquatanks appear in this area. Kill them to get more Thunder Gems. Once you have 5 pieces of Thunder Gems, head back to Triton's throne and exit Atlantica."

      "title": "Collect 3 Mystery Goo.",
      "content": "Collect 3 Mystery Goo. To get Mystery Goo, you must defeat White Mushrooms, Black Fungi, or Rare Truffles. White Mushrooms are the best option because Black Fungi drop Mystery Goo rarely, and Rare Truffles require more skill and patience to beat. Warp to Wonderland and land at the Queen's castle. Head north to the center of the room, then head east. The door there will lead you to Lotus Forest. White Mushrooms spawn here, about 3 or 4 at a time. To beat them, you must follow their game of \"charades\" and guess which spell to cast. For White Mushrooms that shiver, use fire spells; for White Mushrooms that fan themselves, use blizzard spells. If a light appears above the White Mushroom, use thunder spells. If the White Mushroom is on the ground, use cure spells. If the White Mushroom stops moving, use stop spells. If it floats in the air, use gravity spells. If it spins around, use aero spells. After you guess the correct spell 3 times in a row, the Mushroom will reward you with items, including Mystery Goo. Collect 3 Mystery Goo, then go back to the Queen's castle and leave Wonderland."

This room is the last one before the final boss battle. Head back to the previous room rather than going through the last door. This room has 2 types of heartless: Invisibles, which are black, and Angel Stars, which have wings. Kill them and collect pieces of Gale. Head back to the Final Rest and re-enter the room, making heartless spawn again. Kill them and collect pieces of Gale. Repeat as necessary. Once you've collected 3 pieces of Gale, head back to the Final Rest and leave the End of the World."
