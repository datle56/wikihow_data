      "content": "Press Ctrl + X to \"cut\" the file. If you want to completely move the file to another location rather than copy it, this key combination is the one you'll want. If you want to copy the file so a version still remains in the original folder, use Ctrl + C instead."

      "title": "Learn the syntax of the mv command.",
      "content": "Learn the syntax of the mv command. You'll be using the Linux mv command to move a file or folder from one directory to another. The command is used like this: mv source destination . The \"source\" is the file or folder you're moving, and \"destination\" is the place you're moving it to. If you place a -i after the mv command, you'll be prompted if moving the file to the new location will overwrite another file in the destination directory. For specific flags and instructions on the mv command, type man mv at the prompt and press Enter to view its manual page. If you want to copy the file instead of moving it, you'll use cp source destination instead. This will leave the original version of the file in place."

      "title": "Type mv -i filename newlocation and press ↵ Enter.",
      "content": "Type mv -i filename newlocation and press ↵ Enter . If the directory you're moving the file to is not a subfolder of your current directory, be sure to include the full path. For example, if you're moving a folder called photos from your home directory to a folder called /home/family, enter mv -i photos /home/family . If a file or folder with the same name exists, you'll be prompted to enter Y to confirm or N to cancel. Enter your selection and press Enter when prompted."
