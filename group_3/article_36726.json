      "content": "Buff out minor scratches with baking soda paste. Mix 2 parts baking soda with 1 part water in a small cup. Stir the mixture with a spoon or popsicle stick until it has the consistency of a thick paste. Spread this over your scratches or scuff marks and rub it gently into the cooktop with a clean cloth. Then, wipe the cooktop clean to see if the scratch has improved. [1] X Research source When to try this: Run your finger over the scratch—if you don’t feel any gaps, it’s probably small enough to be buffed out with baking soda. Check for improvement: If the scratch has improved after the first pass, try buffing it with baking soda again until it’s barely noticeable. If it hasn’t improved at all, the scratch may be too deep for baking soda."

      "content": "Use non-gel toothpaste as a baking soda alternative. If baking soda doesn’t work—or you don’t have any on hand—you may be able to get the scratches out with plain white toothpaste. Squirt a bead of toothpaste over any scratches you want to remove. Then, use a damp rag to buff the toothpaste into the cooktop using moderately-firm circular motions. Wipe the toothpaste up to see if the scratch is gone. [2] X Research source Choose the right toothpaste: Use white toothpaste with baking soda in it—not gel toothpaste. If the scratch is still there: If the scratch is still very noticeably, move on to polish and an orbital sander . But keep in mind that while you can fade scratches, they might not disappear completely, so if it’s improved, you may not need to do anything else."

      "title": "Use polish and an orbital buffer for tough scratches.",
      "content": "Use polish and an orbital buffer for tough scratches. Any non-abrasive polish will work for this— glass polish is best, but car polish or metal polish will also work. On a cool cooktop, pour a few pea-sized dollops of polish on top of your scratches. Place a cloth or foam buffing pad on an orbital buffer and put the pad over the scratches. Set the buffer to the lowest speed setting and gently work the polish into the cooktop with a constant back-and-forth motion. When you’re finished, wipe away the polish with a clean cloth and check your progress. [3] X Research source Make 3–4 passes as needed. You may not be able to remove the scratches entirely, but the polish should help fill in the scratches and make them significantly less noticeable. If this doesn’t work: The scratches may be too deep to buff away. Try filling the scratch in with a glass filler kit . If that doesn’t work, you may need to replace the cooktop."

      "title": "Use a glass filler kit or epoxy to fill in the cooktop.",
      "content": "Use a glass filler kit or epoxy to fill in the cooktop. Pick up a glass filler or two-part epoxy kit . Clean the crack or chipped area with denatured alcohol, then follow the instructions to mix the filler or epoxy paste in a container to activate it. Protect your hands with nitrile or vinyl gloves and spread the filler over the chip or crack. Wipe up any excess filler or epoxy, running a popsicle stick over the surface to make sure it’s flush. Wait for the filler to dry. Use this method for deep scratches, cracks, or chips. If the cooktop has shattered, you’ll probably need to replace the glass. Make cleanup easy: Line the edges of a crack with painter’s tape if you’re worried about the epoxy getting everywhere. Get a finished look: Paint the filler after it dries if you want it to match the rest of the cooktop. If the edge of your cooktop is cracked: Place a popsicle stick flush on the edge where the crack is located and tape it to the cooktop with painter’s tape. This will make it easier to fill in the gap. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Replace the glass if it’s shattered or deeply cracked.",
      "content": "Replace the glass if it’s shattered or deeply cracked. It’s not safe to use your glass cooktop if the top is shattered or there are deep cracks. You may also need to replace the glass if there are deep scratches over the element—the intense heat from the elements could make cooking unsafe. To order new glass: If you need to replace the glass, look on your stove for a sticker or label with the model number. Then, contact the manufacturer or look online to order a new cooktop, making sure to get one for your exact stove model. Ask the manufacturer for installation instructions: If you only need to remove and replace a few screws, you can probably install the new glass cooktop yourself. [5] X Research source But if the process is more complicated, like if there’s any wiring involved, have it done professionally. How much does it cost? The cost of a new cooktop can vary drastically depending on the brand and model of your stove, but on average, expect to pay $100–$200 for the replacement glass."

      "content": "Lift pots and pans instead of sliding them. If you’re moving a dish off of the element, lift it up and gently place it where you want it to go. Don’t slide the pan across the cooktop—even the slightest rough edge on the bottom of the cookware could scratch the glass. [6] X Research source Use smooth-bottomed cookware, like stainless steel , ceramic , anodized aluminum , or enameled cast iron . Avoid using rough materials like uncoated cast iron or stone. Don’t use damaged pots or pans with jagged edges. Avoid putting metal spatulas or other cooking utensils directly onto the cooktop."

      "content": "Clean your stove with a dampened microfiber cloth and mild dish soap. As soon as the cooktop is cool, wipe it down in a circular motion using a damp cloth with a little dish soap. You can also use a cleaner intended for glass cooktops . [7] X Research source Clean the cooktop every time you use it, and wipe up any spills right away. If you let them dry, you could scratch the glass trying to clean them. [8] X Research source According to Chiu, abrasive cleaners can scratch your glass cooktop. Use mild dish soap instead of harsh cleaners, and don’t use dry towels, steel wool, abrasive sponges, or magic erasers, as these can all damage the glass. Also, avoid scraping the surface with a spatula or abrasive pad. [9] X Research source Glass cooktops aren’t actually straight glass—they’re a blend of glass and ceramic. This means that some chemical glass cleaners, like Windex, may actually weaken the cooktop over time. [10] X Research source"

      "content": "Use a razor blade and cleaning spray to remove burnt-on food. If food spills onto the element, you could end up with a burnt-on mess that seems impossible to clean. Matuska recommends, “Spray the spot with an all-purpose cleaner, then place a razor blade flat against the cooktop, holding it at a low angle.” Work slowly, scraping away the burnt-on food with the edge of the razorblade. Matuska says, “As long as you keep the edge of the razor blade wet, you don’t have to worry about scratching the glass.”"
