      "content": "Check the pedals to see what kind of spanner (wrench) you’ll need. Look at the space in between the pedal and the crank arm (the metal arm that your pedals are attached to). If you see flats for a spanner (wrench) to grip on, you’ll need to use a pedal spanner (wrench). If you don’t see spanner (wrench) flats, check for a hexagonal Allen-key (wrench) socket at the end of the axle that connects the pedal to the crank arm. If you see the socket, you’ll need an Allen-key (wrench). [2] X Research source If you need to use a pedal spanner (wrench), a 15 mm (0.59 in) wrench will usually work for an adult bike. For some children’s bikes, you will need a 9 ⁄ 16 in (14 mm) spanner (wrench). Some pedal spanners (wrenches) have openings in both of these standard sizes. A 6 mm (0.24 in) Allen-key (wrench) will usually work for bikes with Allen-key (wrench) sockets. Some bike pedals are designed so you can use either a pedal spanner (wrench) or an Allen-key (wrench). If you see spanner (wrench) flats on your bike pedal, still check the end of the axle to see if there’s an Allen-key (wrench) socket there."

Hold onto the opposite pedal while you do this to give yourself more leverage. Replace the spanner (wrench) on the flats with the handle back up at the top so you can make another half rotation. Continue to crank the spanner (wrench) counterclockwise until the pedal is fully loosened. [4] X Research source If you’re using an Allen-key (wrench), the socket will likely be on the inside of the pedal spindle. This means you will need to turn the Allen-key (wrench) clockwise (while the spindle itself rotates counterclockwise, from the outside perspective)."

If you feel any play (looseness) in the bearing, then the pedals need to be tightened. Turn the pedals on their bearings and make sure they turn smoothly. Newly installed pedals usually do not spin freely, since the bearings need time to break in. You can also check the axel alignment by turning the pedal crank backwards and watching the pedals carefully. They should stay in the same plane, perpendicular to the crank circle, for the entire rotation."
