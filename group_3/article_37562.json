      "title": "A revert is someone who joins Islam after being raised in a different religion.",
      "content": "A revert is someone who joins Islam after being raised in a different religion. When someone originally of a different religion becomes a Muslim, they “revert” to Islam. This is another way of saying they converted. Many Muslims prefer the term “revert” because they believe that people are born with a natural inclination toward Islam, or fitra. [1] X Research source Others, however, prefer to use “convert” because it’s a more familiar term."

    {
      "title": "The term “revert” suggests someone is returning to Islam.",
      "content": "The term “revert” suggests someone is returning to Islam. Muslims who prefer the term “revert” do so because of the Muslim belief that all people are born with a natural faith in God, or Allah. Children are born with an innate sense of submission to God, known as fitra (or fitrah). [2] X Research source While these children may grow up in a different religion based on their parents’ beliefs, when they join Islam, many see it as “returning” to their original faith in God. Some people prefer being called reverts because they feel a strong connection with the idea of returning to their natural faith."

      "title": "The term “convert” suggests an active choice and change.",
      "content": "The term “convert” suggests an active choice and change. Other Muslims prefer the term “convert” because they feel it better describes the active choice they made to take a life-changing path and join Islam. They may not feel like they’re “going back” to Islam, perhaps because they did not have a strong sense of faith as a child. Some people also prefer to use the term “convert” when talking to non-Muslims, as the term is more familiar than “revert” and will cause less confusion. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "The term “revert” may imply that someone left Islam intentionally.",
      "content": "The term “revert” may imply that someone left Islam intentionally. According to Islamic belief, people “revert” to Islam instead of “converting” because all children are born with a natural faith in God. However, some people who convert to Islam find this term offensive because they didn’t choose to leave the religion—they were never exposed to the religion in the first place. They believe that if they left Islam as a child, it wasn’t their choice, whereas joining Islam is their choice. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "“Revert” may diminish the act of embracing Islam.",
      "content": "“Revert” may diminish the act of embracing Islam. Because some converted Muslims don’t believe they “left” Islam in the first place, they sometimes feel like the term “revert” diminishes their decision to join the religion. They believe that joining Islam is a conscious decision that often comes with a lot of struggle, strife, and dedication. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "“Revert” may be offensive to non-Muslims.",
      "content": "“Revert” may be offensive to non-Muslims. Some people believe that using the term “revert” around non-Muslims may discourage them from learning about Islam. Because the term implies that everyone is born believing in Allah, people of other religions may be offended because they strongly believe in their own god. It may make them feel like Muslims view themselves as superior and are implying that non-Christians have made a mistake in their beliefs. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Ask an individual what they prefer to be called.",
      "content": "Ask an individual what they prefer to be called. The term “revert” can be polarizing, as some Muslims greatly prefer it while others don’t like it at all. To avoid offending someone or making them feel uncomfortable, ask them which term they prefer. When referring to yourself, it’s up to you to decide what you’d like to be called. In writing, it’s acceptable to use “revert/convert” to cover both positions. Some people also prefer the term “new Muslim.” However, the longer they’re a part of the religion, the less fitting this term will be. For example, it wouldn’t be fitting to refer to someone who has been practicing Islam for 10 years as a “new” Muslim, even if they converted/reverted. Remember, if you’re talking to non-Muslims, they may not understand what the term “revert” means. For this reason, many people prefer to use “convert” in these settings. If you use “revert,” just know you may have to do a bit of explaining."

[7] X Research source As you continue to study Islam, read the Quran and familiarize yourself with the text to make sure it is something you truly believe in. Read other important religious scripture, as well, such as the Hadith (the accounts of the Prophet Muhammad). Muslims must believe that the Quran is the literal word of God. When reading the Quran, Mohsin says, “How much do you want to contemplate? You could read one verse and just sit there and think about what it’s saying and what its meaning is and read the research of the scholars… Then, try to apply it to your life.”"

When you’re ready to submit to Allah, say the Shahada with conviction: “La ilaha illa Allah, Muhammadur rasoolu Allah” (“There is no true god but God (Allah) and Muhammad is the Messenger (Prophet) of God.) [8] X Research source Muslims must believe that Allah is the one true God and cannot worship anything other than Him. Mohsin says it’s important to fully understand the Shahada: “[The Shahada] is the key to get into Islam, but you can’t just say the statement and not understand what it means, what it implies, and what is expected of you. Islam itself means submission, so you’re submitting your body, your mind, your soul, and your desires to Allah.” Mohsin adds, “Coming into Islam, we need to understand that sometimes our desires and our temptations go against what is required of us. We’re going to have to learn to submit our desires and our needs.”"

      "content": "Do reverts need a Muslim name? Some reverts choose to change their name to an Arabic name because they believe it is necessary to do so. However, as a general rule, it is not an obligation to change your name. The exceptions to this are if your name has a meaning that conflicts with Islamic teachings or if your name has an evil or bad meaning. [10] X Research source For example, if your name is Christian, it is related to Christianity and not Islam, so it should be changed. Another example is the Prophet’s companions. One companion was originally named Harb (which means “war”), so the Prophet had it changed to Silm (which means “peace”)."

There is no set timeframe, but make sure you understand the core beliefs and teachings of the religion and truly believe that Allah is the one true God. [12] X Research source"
