      "content": "Standard mattress sizes range from a Twin to a California King. Most manufacturers are guaranteed to make Twin, Twin XL, Full, Queen, King, and California King mattresses. Many also offer crib/toddler mattresses and specialty sizes, like an Olympic Queen or Alaskan King. There’s no universal thickness for mattresses, but the length and width are standardized. Here’s a breakdown of all the different mattress dimensions: [1] X Research source Toddler/crib: 28 x 52 inches (71 x 132 cm) Twin: 38 x 75 inches (97 x 191 cm) Twin XL: 38 x 80 inches (97 x 203 cm) Full (Double): 54 x 74 inches (137 x 188 cm) Queen: 60 x 80 inches (152 x 203 cm) King: 76 x 80 inches (193 x 203 cm) California King: 72 x 84 inches (183 x 213 cm) Olympic Queen: 66 x 80 inches (168 x 203 cm) Wyoming King: 84 x 84 inches (213 x 213 cm) Texas King: 80 x 89 inches (203 x 226 cm) Alaskan King: 108 x 108 inches (274 x 274 cm)"

      "content": "Twin A standard Twin mattress is 38 x 75 inches (97 x 191 cm), sleeps one person comfortably, and is great for small bedrooms. They’re often used in children’s or guest rooms, dormitories, and bunk beds. They’re generally pretty affordable and there are a lot of different styles of bed frames you can choose to match. [2] X Research source Best for: Children, teens, adults under 6 feet (1.8 m) tall Minimum suggested room size: 7 x 9 feet (2.1 x 2.7 m) without other furniture; 8 x 10 feet (2.4 x 3 m) with other furniture"

It’s a great choice for tall teens or adults who sleep alone and need extra legroom. Like regular Twins, these are most often found in guest rooms and dormitories. [3] X Research source Best for: Tall teens and adults over 6 feet (1.8 m) or single sleepers who want to sleep with a pet Minimum suggested room size: 7 x 10 feet (2.1 x 3 m) without other furniture; 8 x 10 feet (2.4 x 3 m) with other furniture"

      "content": "Full Also called a Double mattress, a Full mattress measures 54 x 74 inches (137 x 188 cm). It’s more spacious than a Twin and is great for single sleepers who like to spread out. It can also accommodate a couple, but it may feel snug to some. Full mattresses are versatile and great for guest rooms, small bedrooms, or studio apartments. One drawback to a Full is that the price is close to that of a Queen, but with less space. [4] X Research source Best for: Single sleepers, teenagers, adults under 6 feet (1.8 m) tall, some couples Minimum suggested room size: 9 x 10 feet (2.7 x 3 m) without other furniture; 10 x 12 feet (3 x 3.7 m) with other furniture"

In fact, it’s the most common mattress size of all, meaning it’s easy to find bedframes and accessories to suit your style. It’s a versatile size that fits well in primary bedrooms or large studio apartments. [5] X Research source Best for: Couples, single sleepers who need more space or who sleep with pets Minimum suggested room size: 10 x 10 feet (3 x 3 m) without other furniture; 10 x 14 feet (3 x 4.3 m) with other furniture An Olympic Queen is 6 inches (15 cm) wider than a standard Queen, making it a great choice for couples who want more room without upgrading to a King mattress."

It’s excellent for couples who want a spacious sleeping experience or who frequently share the bed with children or pets. Kings are standard in large primary bedrooms, oversized lofts, or spacious guest rooms, but may overwhelm smaller spaces. They’re considered the ultimate mattress for space, comfort, and luxury. [6] X Research source Best for: Couples who want extra space or who sleep with children or pets Minimum suggested room size: 12 x 12 feet (3.7 x 3.7 m) without other furniture; 13 x 13 feet (4 x 4 m) with other furniture A Split King mattress has the same dimensions as a King but is “split” in the middle so each sleeper can customize their half of the bed. Each half is the same size as a Twin XL mattress (38 x 80 inches (97 x 203 cm))."

It’s 4 inches (10.2 cm) narrower and 4 inches longer than a regular King, making it perfect for couples or tall sleepers who need more length without sacrificing a lot of width. On the downside, it’s the most expensive of the standard mattress sizes and there are fewer bedframe and accessory options available. [7] X Research source Best for: Tall sleepers, couples, couples who share the bed with children or pets Minimum suggested room size: 12 x 12 feet (3.7 x 3.7 m) without other furniture; 13 x 13 feet (4 x 4 m) with other furniture A Split California King has two sides that each measure 36 x 84 inches (91 x 213 cm), making each side slightly narrower and longer than a Twin XL.

Its unique square shape makes it a focal point in large primary bedrooms. A Texas King (80 x 89 inches (203 x 6 cm)) is only a few inches wider than a King but significantly longer, making it a great option for extra-tall sleepers who need more legroom. An Alaskan King (108 x 108 inches (274 x 274 cm)) is the largest mattress of them all and provides an unmatched amount of space in very large sleeping areas."

A crib mattress is firm, fits snugly into a standard crib’s dimensions, and is slightly thinner than a Twin mattress. Toddler mattresses (for kids aged 2–5 years old) are softer and fit in beds without rails so toddlers can get in and out of bed themselves. [8] X Research source"

Most small kids’ rooms, guest rooms, and dorm rooms that are 7 x 10 feet (2.1 x 3 m) or bigger are suitable for a Twin or Twin XL. Slightly larger bedrooms that are at least 10 x 10 feet (3 x 3 m) and studio apartments can fit a Full or Queen well. King beds are best for large master bedrooms measuring at least 12 x 12 feet (3.7 x 3.7 m). Consider the difficulty of moving your mattress, too. Larger mattresses are more challenging to fit through narrow doorways or hallways leading to your bedroom. [9] X Research source Tip: If you want a King but are concerned about moving it, consider a split King or split California King so you only have to move the 2 smaller halves."

This is because your spine will need support in different places depending on how you sleep: [12] X Research source Back sleepers need a medium-firm or firm mattress with light to moderate contouring to support their lower back. Side sleepers do best with medium-soft or medium-firm mattresses to support pressure points like their shoulders and hips, which are stacked on top of each other while side sleeping. Stomach sleepers need a firm mattress to support their lower back, similar to back sleepers. Combination sleepers (people who sleep in multiple positions) should base firmness on the position they spend the most time in.

Generally, a higher thread count means softer and higher-quality sheets. The way the thread is woven together also makes a difference: Percale weaves use a tight, criss-cross weave that’s soft, cool, and durable. Sateen weaves are heavier than percale and buttery soft. They’re great for cold climates but also breathable enough for warm weather. Jersey knits are soft, warm, and feel like a worn-in T-shirt. Not sure where to start sheet shopping?
