      "title": "Flirting isn't seduction, but it does set the stage.",
      "content": "Flirting isn't seduction, but it does set the stage. Plus, several playful back-and-forth messages can make her eager to see you in person. Flirt with her whenever you think of her during the day or in the hours before your date. You might text: [1] X Research source \"This is the longest day ever. How am I supposed to go 12 hours without seeing you?\" \"I can't get the picture of you out of my mind. How can I function when I'm so distracted?\" \"We haven't even gone on our date, but I'm already regretting having to say goodnight to you.\""

      "title": "Scorpios usually prefer to communicate in person.",
      "content": "Scorpios usually prefer to communicate in person. This is because they're really good at reading non-verbal cues. Texting can be trickier. When you do send her a message, don't try to have a long, in-depth conversation. Instead, use texting to set up a date or flirt before you meet up. After all, it's a great way to pique her interest before seeing you in person. You could say: \"We're still on for 8 pm, right? I can't wait to see what you've got in store for me.\" \"You still buying me a coffee? I'm all yours after 5.\" \"I think it's my turn to pick tonight's movie unless you'd rather do something else tonight?\""

      "content": "Don't reveal too much or pry when you text her. A Scorpio doesn't want you revealing your deepest thoughts or asking about hers when you're texting. Instead, she wants to be intrigued and curious about you, so keep your cards close to your chest. [2] X Research source For example, instead of texting, \"Tell me about what happened in your last relationship,\" or telling her about your ex, send a message like, \"You'd be surprised to learn where I've traveled.\" Then, don't reveal any more. You could also say, \"I tend to follow my passions. Right now I'm focusing on my music.\" Try texting her, \"I've always been drawn to unique women and you're no exception.\""

      "content": "Try to come across as secure and interested in her. She'll be able to tell if you're nervous or not trying very hard. For instance, never text a Scorpio, \"Hey\" or any message that tells her you're not making a clear move. Scorpios are impressed by bold initiative, so don't be afraid to be direct with her. So, instead of just saying, \"What's up?\" cut to the chase. You might want to ask her out or ask her opinion about something. You might text, \"I'd really like to take you out for dessert,\" or \"Will you go to a concert with me?\" so she sees you taking the initiative."

[7] X Research source For example, if she texts something like, \"Want to do something this weekend?\" you could reply with, \"I may have something going on,\" or just leave it at, \"I'm not sure yet.\" This leaves her curious about your plans and she'll probably want to be part of them."

      "content": "Let your relationship unfold naturally! There's no need to rush a Scorpio woman. In fact, trying to speed up the relationship can actually make her more hesitant to get involved.

Remember, Scorpios usually prefer in-person communication, so texting can be a little awkward for her. [9] X Research source Use your judgment to decide if you should text her again. You might wait a few days before sending a gentle message like, \"I hope I didn't say something wrong. Maybe we could meet up soon?\" The exception to this is if she thinks you've lied or been dishonest with her. Silence might be her way of letting you know she's unhappy."
