      "content": "Switch to other natural flavors to take a break from lemon.

These are gentler on your teeth and they add bright, herbal flavors to the water. [6] X Research source You can also add fresh tomatoes and basil for garden-fresh water or add cubes of fresh melon like honeydew or cantaloupe."

      "content": "Drink the lemon water through a straw. One of the easiest ways to protect your enamel from damage is to sip the lemon water through a straw instead of drinking it out of a glass. The straw directs the acidic beverage towards the back of your mouth so it doesn't coat your teeth. [7] X Research source Keep paper or metal straws in your bag if you like to drink your lemon water on the go."

      "content": "Wait 60 minutes after drinking lemon water to brush your teeth. You might think that you should immediately brush your teeth, but this can damage your teeth even more. The acidic lemon juice softens your enamel so it's more sensitive and prone to damage from scrubbing. [12] X Research source If you have a hard time remember to brush, set a timer on your phone to remind you."
