You need to know your triggers in order to protect yourself from triggering experiences and eventually learn to live with them. To learn what your triggers are, try acting like a casual observer to yourself for a matter of days or weeks to figure out which stimuli have a triggering effect on you. [4] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Triggers might be a person who resembles an attacker, a sound that reminds you of the trauma, insulting or demeaning words, or a specific time of the year.

Once you know what your triggers are, you can slowly develop a plan to better manage your response to them. Consider sharing these with someone you trust for additional help."
