      "content": "Learning about your partner’s attachment style will help you understand them. If your partner has an avoidant attachment style, they’re most likely fiercely independent. They probably won’t ask for help often. You may have to pry to get them to open up, and they might have even called you “needy” for expressing your emotions in the past. An avoidant attachment style usually stems from childhood, and your partner’s caregiver may have been cold or unavailable. [1] X Trustworthy Source HelpGuide Nonprofit organization dedicated to providing free, evidence-based mental health and wellness resources. Go to source People with avoidant attachment styles often crave intimacy, but at the same time, they’re afraid of it. This is why your partner might be cold or shut down sometimes—it’s their way of coping with that fear."

      "title": "Avoidant partners need to spend a lot of time on their own.",
      "content": "Avoidant partners need to spend a lot of time on their own. If you chase your partner down and demand that they talk to you, they most likely won’t react very well. If your partner doesn’t seem receptive to opening up to you right now, give them some time to work through things on their own before you approach them again. [2] X Research source It can be tough to give up on an important conversation without talking things through fully. Let your partner know that you’d like to revisit the topic by saying something like, “Can we talk about this later?” or, “I’ll give you a few minutes to collect your thoughts, but I’d like to continue this conversation.” Reader Poll: We asked 659 wikiHow readers about the most effective ways to deal with a dismissive avoidant partner, and only 9% of them recommended letting your partner know when they do something you like . [Take Poll] Instead, giving your partner space can be a more effective way to improve your communication."

      "content": "Avoidant partners tend to shut down out of self-preservation. It can be frustrating when your partner won’t talk through issues with you. Try to remember that they probably don’t like it either, but they can’t help it. The more you can give them understanding and grace, the better your communication will be. Try to focus on what you can change, not what you can’t. You can’t change your partner’s attachment style, but you can change how you react to their behavior."

      "title": "When tensions run high, an avoidant partner may shut down.",
      "content": "When tensions run high, an avoidant partner may shut down. Studies show that avoidant types tend to respond well to indirect language that doesn’t put their guard up. When you’re getting ready to approach your partner with a problem, try taking a few deep breaths and counting to 10 before you talk to them about it. [3] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source “Do you have a second to talk? I wanted to chat about what happened the other day. Don’t worry, it’s not anything super serious.” “Hey, could we chat real fast? I just wanted to talk something through with you, but I’m not mad.”"

      "content": "Many avoidants tend to shut down in the face of other people’s emotions. When you’re talking about your feelings (which you should feel free to do in a relationship), try your best to say things in a neutral tone without a ton of emotion behind them. It can be tough to calm down enough to do this in a charged situation, but your partner will be much more receptive toward your needs if you can. [4] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source If you’re having a tough time keeping your tone neutral, take a few deep breaths and count to 10 before you start talking."

      "content": "A lot of avoidants struggle with low self-esteem. They tend to take criticism very personally, even if it’s not a reflection of their character. [5] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Try to use language that won’t make your partner upset, and when you’re discussing problems, use “I” statements to avoid putting blame on them. Instead of saying, “You always ignore me,” try, “When I don’t hear from you throughout the day, I feel worried.” Instead of, “You treat me terribly,” try, “I feel like I should be a higher priority in your life.”"

      "content": "Avoidant partners often have a hard time picking up on hints. Instead of trying to nudge your partner in the right direction, talk to them clearly and concisely, and spell out exactly what you need. The clearer you can be, the more your partner will understand your needs and work to meet them. [6] X Research source “I’d really like it if we could spend at least 2 days a week together. Does that work for your schedule?” “It’s fine if you’re busy, but I need you to text me at least once a day. I just want to know that you’re okay.”"

      "content": "Healthy boundaries tell your partner what’s okay and what isn’t. Even though your partner has an avoidant attachment style, it doesn’t mean you need to put up with behavior that you don’t like. [7] X Research source Try to set boundaries right away so your partner knows how you’d like to be treated in the future. “I know you don’t like talking about your emotions, but sometimes, I need to express mine. Can you try to listen to me, even when it’s uncomfortable for you?” “When you need space, just let me know. I’m fine leaving you alone for a while, but I need to know ahead of time so I don’t worry about you.”"

      "content": "You and your partner might have to meet in the middle so you’re both happy. Your communication styles are probably very different, and that’s okay. Instead of trying to change your partner, do your best to bend a little and meet them halfway. Find something that you can both live with to be content in your relationship. [8] X Research source “I understand that you need your space, but I’d like to spend more quality time together. Could we try to go out on a date at least once a week?” “We don’t need to call each other every day—I know that’s tough for you. Maybe we could commit to at least texting each other in the evening?”"

      "content": "Your partner is more likely to repeat things if you notice their hard work. When your partner tries their best to meet your needs or does something uncomfortable, tell them that you’ve noticed and you’re grateful for it. Over time, this will encourage them to keep trying so they continue to make healthy changes in your relationship. [9] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source “Thanks for texting me yesterday when you needed some space. It was great to know beforehand that I wouldn’t hear from you.” “I really appreciate you listening to me talk about this. I know emotions are tough for you to handle, and I can tell you’re working hard.”"

      "content": "Your partner is more likely to open up if you listen carefully to what they say. People with avoidant attachment styles find it difficult to talk about what they’re feeling, so they don’t do it often. If your partner trusts you enough to get deep with you, show that you’re listening by putting away distractions and making eye contact with them. [10] X Research source Ask follow up questions to show that you want them to keep going. Say things like, “Interesting, can you tell me more?” or, “Could you explain that?” Empathetic listening also gives your partner a good model of how they should be listening to you."

      "content": "Waiting for your partner to change can lead to heartbreak. It’s easy to get swept up in the hope that your partner might make a ton of awesome changes and break through their avoidant habits. Your partner definitely can change, and they might make an effort to meet your needs as you talk to them more. However, you can help your relationship by actively working to accept your partner for who they are right now. [11] X Research source For the most part, people can change small things about themselves, like how messy they are or how late they stay up. But their personality types and attachment styles need a lot of work to change."

      "content": "Your partner will feel more secure if they can rely on you. People with avoidant attachment styles are often scared to get close to other people, because they’re worried they might get hurt. Try to show your partner that they can lean on you no matter what—the safer and more secure they feel with you, the more they’ll open up. [12] X Trustworthy Source Greater Good Magazine Journal published by UC Berkeley's Greater Good Science Center, which uses scientific research to promote happier living Go to source For instance, you might help them change their flat tire or give them a ride when they need it.

      "content": "They may never say it out loud, but avoidants crave romantic love. While it might seem like your partner wants space from you all the time, it’s more likely that they crave your attention but they don’t know how to ask for it. Don’t give up on showing your partner love—the more you do it, the more they’ll get used to it. And when your partner feels more comfortable, your communication will improve, too. [13] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source If your partner is uncomfortable with words of affirmation, try showing them affection in other ways. Buy them a small gift or do a chore for them around the house to let them know that you care."

People with avoidant attachment styles can talk to a mental health professional to work toward a more secure attachment. You can suggest that your partner sees a therapist, or you can ask them to try couple’s counseling with you.
