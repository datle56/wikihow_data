Most Linux distributions have a Menu option in the lower-left corner of the screen, inside of which you'll find an application called \"Terminal\"; this is what you'll open to bring up the command line. Since Linux distributions vary in appearance from release to release, you may have to look for the \"Terminal\" or command line app inside of a folder in the Menu . You may find the \"Terminal\" app on the desktop or in the toolbar at the bottom of the screen instead of in the Menu . Some Linux distributions have a command line bar at the top or bottom of the screen."
