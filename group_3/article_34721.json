      "title": "Gather volcanic stones for the hangi.",
      "content": "Gather volcanic stones for the hangi. A hangi for 25 people will require enough volcanic stones to fill a 1 m (3.3 ft) in diameter hole, around 0.5 m (1.6 ft) deep. Non-volcanic stones will crack and explode when heated, which can be dangerous. Use a search engine to find where you can collect volcanic rocks in your area."

      "title": "Collect pieces of hardwood for the hangi.",
      "content": "Collect pieces of hardwood for the hangi. Wood for a hangi must be untreated, and you will need 45 pieces that are 1 m (3.3 ft) long and 5-8 cm (2-3 in) wide. A slow burning wood such as mānuka or macrocarpa works well. A hangi will only be successful if the wood used takes a long time to burn, which is why hardwoods are necessary."

      "title": "Get 3 food baskets.",
      "content": "Get 3 food baskets. Food baskets for hangi are usually wire trays with sides, but they can be made out of a variety of different materials. Baskets that are made from small chicken mesh, or welded perforated steel containers are common. The number of baskets that you will need will depend on how many people you are feeding. Three baskets will be enough for 25 people. Typically the food is divided into the three baskets, one of red meat, the next poultry, and the last for vegetables."

      "title": "Dig the hole slightly bigger that the stacked food baskets.",
      "content": "Dig the hole slightly bigger that the stacked food baskets. 200-300mm (7.9-11.8 in) deeper and 200mm (7.9 in) wider and longer than the baskets works well. The hole will need to be slightly larger than the food baskets when they are stacked, so that there is enough room for sacks to be placed on the sides which will protect the food from the embers and dirt. [1] X Research source A hole that’s too deep or big will make it difficult to retrieve the food safely when it’s ready. [2] X Research source Overall the hole will be big enough to hold the food baskets, sacks, and stones."

      "title": "Pile the wood and volcanic stones on the ground to make a fire stack.",
      "content": "Pile the wood and volcanic stones on the ground to make a fire stack. There is no particular order to stack the wood and stones, and all that matters is that there is enough room beneath the stack to start a fire, and that the stones are evenly distributed throughout the stack. The fire stack should be located next to the pit, so that you can easily transfer the hot stones. [3] X Research source If you stack the wood and stones the day before you plan to have the hangi, make sure that you cover the stack with a tarpaulin overnight to prevent it getting wet."

      "content": "Light the wood in the fire stack in 3-4 places. Light a match and set alight 3-4 corners of the fire stack. If the wood doesn't show flames immediately, blow gently on the smouldering area to help it along. [4] X Research source The fire will spread throughout the stack of wood and stones."

      "title": "Let the fire burn for 3-5 hours before you start cooking.",
      "content": "Let the fire burn for 3-5 hours before you start cooking. This lets the stones gather enough heat to be able to eventually cook the food. You will know that the stones are ready to use when they are visibly white. [5] X Research source While the fire is burning, make sure that somebody is watching it at all times. This will ensure the safety of everyone, and someone can also make sure that the stones are placed back into the fire if they fall out. Watch out for a changing wind direction, as this could blow the stack over. If the stones are particularly large and are having trouble heating evenly, rotate them during this process.

Peel the potatoes, carrots, and kumara, and then chop them into pieces around 13 cm (5 in) in length, or the size of your palm. Aim to have 1 potato, 1 carrot, and 1 kumara per person. [7] X Research source Pieces that are too big won’t cook properly, but pieces that are too small will turn mushy. [8] X Research source If you want to add a seasoning to your hangi, sprinkle some garlic powder or dried herbs generously over the vegetables."

      "content": "Get the meat for the hangi. Common meats that are used are pork, chicken, and lamb. Aim for around 400g (0.88 lb) of meat per person. Make sure that all frozen meats are fully thawed. [9] X Research source You can use many types of meat for a hangi. Chicken thighs or whole chickens are commonly cooked, and you can also use whole roast sized pieces of other types of meat. As long as the pieces aren't tiny and won't cook too fast, they will be fine inside the hangi. [10] X Research source You can season your meat at this stage if you prefer. Generous salt and pepper sprinklings are common, but garlic with herbs like rosemary and sage are also common. [11] X Research source"

Remove any remaining leftover wood pieces before you put the rocks into the pit. Place the stones side by side in the pit, with as few gaps between the stones as possible. [14] X Research source This part of the hangi process needs to be done as quickly as possible to prevent the rocks from cooling. Rotate people for transporting the rocks as it is a tiring process."

This will help to create the steam that is necessary for the hangi to cook. Mutton cloth, a table cloth, or a bed sheet are ideal types of material to use for the sheet. The size and material of the sacks doesn't matter. As long as you have enough sacks to cover the stacked food baskets, then this is all that matters.
