      "title": "Roan is captivated by her love interest.",
      "content": "Roan is captivated by her love interest. In the opening lines of the song, Roan sings, “She was a Playboy, Brigitte Bardot / She showed me things I didn’t know.” Both Playboy bunnies and actress Brigitte Bardot are sex symbols known for their beauty, but Bardot was also known for her rebellious spirit. Here, we see that Roan is fascinated by her love interest not only because of her looks but because she is wild and alluring. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "The relationship is focused on the physical rather than the emotional.",
      "content": "The relationship is focused on the physical rather than the emotional. In the first verse, Roan sings, “Put her canine teeth in the side of my neck.” This shows that the relationship is physical and somewhat animalistic rather than sweet and innocent. Roan does not shy away from the sexual elements of the song. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "The speaker feels overwhelmed by the relationship.",
      "content": "The speaker feels overwhelmed by the relationship. In the pre-chorus, Roan sings, “I just wanna get to know ya / Guess I didn’t quite think it through / Fell in love with the thought of you / Now I’m choked up, face down, burnt out.” While “Red Wine Supernova” comes off as a happy-go-lucky song, these lines suggest Roan may have bitten off more than she can chew and didn’t quite know what she signed up for when beginning the relationship.

    {
      "title": "The relationship is passionate and explosive.",
      "content": "The relationship is passionate and explosive. In the chorus, Roan sings, “Baby, why don’t you come over? / Red wine supernova, falling into me / I don’t care that you’re a stoner / Red wine supernova, fall right into me.” Supernovas are bright explosions that occur at the end of a star’s life. These lines suggest that the relationship may be passionate but short-lived (like a hookup), or it may be an innuendo for an explosive orgasm. [4] X Research source The line “I don’t care that you’re a stoner” also suggests that the speaker is willing to overlook things that could be red flags or that the love interest is insecure about. She’s throwing caution to the wind."

      "content": "The bridge playfully addresses the reality of young adult relationships. The speaker and her partner may have a passionate relationship, but their romantic ideals may clash with practical limitations. In the bridge, Roan sings, “Well, back at my house / I’ve got a California king / Okay, maybe it’s a twin bed / And some roommates (Don’t worry, we’re cool).” This makes the song relatable, as many people live in situations like this while trying to have a physical relationship with their partner. The bridge also suggests the speaker’s vulnerability, as she’s sharing this information with her partner."

      "content": "The speaker wants to explore her sexual interests. In the bridge, Roan sings, “I heard you like magic / I’ve got a wand and a rabbit / So baby, let’s get freaky, get kinky / Let’s make this bed get squeaky.” Here, the wand and rabbit are a double entendre, as they’re common props in magic as well as common sex toys. Roan is playfully suggesting she wants to explore her relationship and sexual desires with her partner further. [6] X Research source"
