      "content": "Begin by holding the crucifix in your fingers while making the Sign of the Cross. The rosary is said by traveling around the loop of beads, stopping at each one, and saying a prayer. Typically, if someone is going to say the whole rosary, rather than just a section of it, s/he starts with the crucifix at the \"bottom\"."

      "title": "Say the Apostle's Creed.",
      "content": "Say the Apostle's Creed . This prayer is a statement of Christian belief, one that essentially summarizes the things that all Christians believe, including the existence of God, Jesus, the Holy Spirit, and the Resurrection. The words of the Apostles' Creed are: \"I believe in God, the Father Almighty, Creator of heaven and earth; and in Jesus Christ, His only Son, our Lord: Who was conceived by power of the Holy Spirit, born of the Blessed Virgin Mary; suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, died and was buried. He descended into hell; the third day He rose again from the dead; He ascended into heaven, is seated at the right hand of God the Father Almighty; from thence He shall come to judge the living and the dead. I believe in the Holy Spirit, the Holy Catholic Church, the communion of Saints, the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the body, and life everlasting. Amen.\" When Protestants say the Apostle's Creed, they usually change the meaning of the word \"Catholic\" in the line \"I believe in the Holy Spirit, the holy Catholic Church, the communion of saints...\" to reflect the concept of universality, rather than the actual earthly institution of the Roman Catholic church."

      "content": "Move to the first bead after the crucifix and say the Lord's Prayer . Take the next bead in your fingers and say the Lord's prayer (also called the \"Our Father\"). This prayer was passed directly from Jesus to his disciples as a way of expressing devotion to God in heaven. The words of the Our Father are: \"Our Father, Who art in Heaven, hallowed be Thy Name. Thy Kingdom come, Thy Will be done, on earth as it is in Heaven. Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. Amen.\""

      "content": "Move to the following group of three beads and say three Hail Marys. Next, say one Hail Mary for each of the next three beads, taking each bead in your fingers as you begin each prayer in succession. Traditionally, among Catholics, these 3 Hail Marys are offered to obtain an increase in the virtues of Faith, Hope and Charity and for the intentions of the Pope. The words of the Hail Mary are: \"Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners, now and at the hour of our death. Amen.\" Some Protestants are hesitant to say the Hail Mary because it is offered to Mary, rather than God or Jesus. Though it's up to you to decide whether you want to say the Hail Mary or not, the many arguments put forth by members of the Catholic Church and various Protestant churches [1] X Research source regarding the prayer's biblical basis may help you come to a decision. If you're reluctant to say the Hail Mary, know that some Protestant churches have their own versions of the rosary that omit this prayer."

The Doxology (also called the \"Glory Be to the Father\" or \"Gloria Patri\") is a short hymn of praise exulting God, Jesus, and the Holy Spirit. The words of the Doxology are: \"Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost. As it was in the beginning, is now, will be for ever. Amen.\" Often, if the Holy rosary is made from string, rather than chain, the Doxology will be marked with a thick or knotted section."

Lead all souls to heaven, especially those in most need of Thy mercy.\" The words of the prayer for priests are: \"O Jesus, our great High Priest, hear my humble prayers on behalf of your priests. Give them a deep faith, a bright and firm hope and a burning love which will ever increase in the course of their priestly life. In their loneliness, comfort them. In their sorrows, strengthen them. In their frustrations, point out to them that it is through suffering that the soul is purified, and show them that they are needed by the Church; they are needed by souls; they are needed for the work of redemption.\""

Now, continue along the Holy rosary's beads, following the pattern of the first decade for each subsequent decade - one Our Father for the first bead, followed by a Hail Mary for each of the following ten beads, followed by a Doxology. Work your way along the rosary in this fashion until you have gone all the way around the chain of beads and are back at the large central bead."

To thee do we cry, poor banished children of Eve; to thee do we send up our sighs, mourning and weeping in this vale of tears. Turn then, most gracious advocate, thine eyes of mercy toward us, and after this, our exile, show unto us the blessed fruit of thy womb, Jesus. O clement, O loving, O sweet Virgin Mary! Pray for us, O Holy Mother of God, that we may be made worthy of the promises of Christ.\" Catholic tradition dictates that, if you like, you may add any prayers at the end of the Holy rosary that you like. These can be \"official\" prayers like the Our Father and Apostle's Creed or personal, improvised prayers from the heart."

      "content": "Use the mysteries to deepen your relationship with Christ and Mary. The Holy rosary is not just a prayer tool - it's also a way to reflect on important events in the lives of Jesus and Mary. Many serious Catholics choose to do so by reflecting on certain sets of mysteries as they pray the Holy rosary. Each set contains five mysteries grouped according to certain emotional themes. Individual mysteries are events in the life of Jesus and/or Mary that are taken from the Bible. Each mystery is associated with a certain religious virtue or \"spiritual fruit\" (e.g. charity, patience, etc.). By reflecting on these mysteries, someone who prays the Holy rosary can work to strengthen his or her personal relationship with Jesus and Mary, meditating on each event and the spiritual fruit associated with it. Note that not everyone who says the rosary chooses to do this, but anyone can . There are currently four sets of mysteries. The fourth mystery was added by Pope John Paul II in 2002; the others are centuries old. [2] X Research source The sets of mysteries are: The Joyful Mysteries The Sorrowful Mysteries The Glorious Mysteries The Luminous Mysteries (added by Pope Saint John Paul II in 2002)"

To say the rosary in observance of one of the sets of mysteries, the person saying the rosary proceeds as normal from the crucifix through the first few beads. When s/he reaches the first decade, s/he meditates on the first mystery as s/he prays the Our Father, the ten Hail Marys, and so on. Upon reaching the second decade, s/he meditates on the second mystery as s/he prays. The person saying the rosary proceeds through the rosary in this fashion, reflecting on a different mystery for each decade. Each set of mysteries contains five mysteries - one for each decade of the rosary. Traditionally, a person reflects on a different set of mysteries for each day of the week.

These mysteries are events from Jesus' adult life and ministry.

The Luminous Mysteries and the spiritual fruits associated with each are listed below: The Baptism of Jesus in the Jordan: Openness to the Holy Spirit, the Healer. The Wedding at Cana: To Jesus through Mary. The understanding of the ability to manifest through faith.
