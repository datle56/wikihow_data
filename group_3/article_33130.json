      "content": "Know what the cards mean as you draw them: The Exploding Kitten card makes you eliminated immediately unless you use a defuse card. When you use a Defuse card you get to put the Exploding Kitten anywhere in the deck. The Favor card means the person who played the card picks any opponent to give them a card of the opponent's choice. The Nope card can be used any time during the game to stop any action except against an Exploding Kitten or a Defuse card. It is even possible to \"nope\" a \"nope\". The Attack card forces the next player to go twice, and you don't need to draw a card at the end of your turn. The \"Double slap\" and \"Triple slap\" cards forces anyone playing to take two or three turns in a row. The Skip card lets you skip your turn without drawing a card. The Shuffle card lets you shuffle the deck. The \"See the Future\" card allows you to see the next three cards in the deck. The \"Alter the Future\" card allows you to rearrange the next three cards in the deck. The \"Draw from the Bottom\" card allows you to end your turn by drawing from the bottom of the deck instead of the top. Cat cards aren't useful by themselves but can be used in Special Combos or Pairs. The \"Feral Cat\" allows you to use the card as any cat card."

If you have triples (Three of a Kind) of a card with no instructions you get to ask any opponent for any card. If they do not have the card you ask for you get nothing. If they do you get to keep that card. If you have five different cat cards, then dive into the discard pile and grab any card you want. In Advanced Play, any two or three cards with matching icons in their corners can be played as pairs, rather than only instruction-less cards. And if you have five cards with different icons in the corners (with or without instructions) then you can look through the Discard Pile and grab any card you want."
