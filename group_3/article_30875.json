      "content": "The Merkaba is a sacred geometric symbol that represents balance. The Merkaba contains two tetrahedrons, or triangular pyramids. [1] X Research source The tetrahedrons represent the combination of masculine and feminine energies, which symbolize balance and how everything in life is connected. [2] X Research source The upward-pointing tetrahedron represents the masculine, or active, energy. The downward-pointing tetrahedron represents the feminine, or receptive, energy. The two tetrahedrons spin in opposite directions, creating a 3-dimensional energy field. Many people channel the Merkaba in meditation as a form of healing because it is said that it can transport your consciousness to higher dimensions—hence the name “Merkaba,” which can be thought of as a “vehicle of light.” [3] X Research source"

Sacred geometry designs can be traced back to the art, decor, and spirituality of ancient times."

      "content": "Activate the Merkaba through meditation. Meditating while visualizing a Merkaba is a great way to connect with your emotional healing. Follow these steps to perform a Merkaba activation meditation: [12] X Research source Find a quiet spot. You’ll want an area free of noises, distractions, and anything that might interrupt your meditation. You can choose to either sit or lie down—whichever is more comfortable for you. Close your eyes. Visualize the Merkaba symbol. Picture the Merkaba spinning around you. Imagine the tetrahedrons spinning in opposite directions. To activate the Merkaba, visualize each pyramid spinning in opposite directions—one spinning clockwise and the other counterclockwise. Feel the energy field and pay attention to any sensations of activation or increased energy. Picture pure, white light around your body. Imagine the Merkaba is made entirely of light, and the light is enveloping you within its brightness. Take slow, deep breaths. Set your intentions. What exactly do you want to come out of this mediation session? Ask yourself what you’d like to attract, manifest, or heal. Thank the universe. To wrap up the mediation, express gratitude to the universe for listening and picture vibrations heightened, your chakras aligned, and your aura charged up and shining. Finish by grounding yourself. Slowly allow your focus to return to the present moment and your physical body. Take some deep breaths and gradually open your eyes. Sit or stand up gently and aim to bring the energy from the session into the rest of the day."

Here’s a brief guide for what to visualize during every breath: [13] X Research source 1st Breath: The first breath is aimed toward opening your heart and feeling a sense of love and compassion for anything and everything. Breathe from your nose and hold your breath in your stomach and diaphragm for a few seconds. 2nd-5th Breaths: Continue the same breathing pattern as the first breath. 6th Breath: Keep the same breathing style, but take 12 breaths total. The first 6 breaths will help balance your polarities, while the second 6 will clear your electromagnetic field. 7th Breath: The 7th breath is all about inhaling. As a way to store love in your heart, hold this breath in your chest area. 8th Breath: The 8th breath focuses on exhaling all negative or blocked energy from within yourself. 9th Breath: Shift your breathing focus to the area of your belly button. 10th Breath: Focus on your breathing. Allow this breath to pass gently over your lips. 11th Breath: Combine the 9th and 10th breaths. 12th-13th Breaths: Continue the 11th breath pattern. 14th Breath: Breathe from your belly button all the way to the center of your chest. 15th Breath: The 15th breath serves as your entry into the Merkaba experience. Relax further. 16th-17th Breaths: Keep the rhythm of the 15th breath in order to stabilize your Merkaba. 18th Breath: Now, allow your higher self to take control of the 18th breath and travel wherever the sacred geometry takes you."
