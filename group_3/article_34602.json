      "content": "Wait 1 year for the sapling to grow 30 in (76 cm) before pruning. Ensure the sapling is well over 30 in (76 cm) before cutting it to avoid weakening the tree. Pruning should be carried out during the summer, or when rain is unlikely for at least 6 weeks to avoid brown rot. [1] X Research source Some say pruning should be carried out when the tree is dormant, usually during the last weeks of November to mid-December in the Northern Hemisphere. [2] X Research source However, it’s always best to check the weather for the next rainfall. Light formative pruning can be done in the spring for a newly planted cherry plant. [3] X Trustworthy Source Royal Horticultural Society Leading gardening charity in the U.K. providing resources for identifying, growing and caring for flowers and other plants Go to source Cherry trees have a low tolerance for wet feet and are susceptible to brown rot, bacterial canker, root and crown rots, and water-borne fungal diseases. [4] X Research source Cherry trees come in two varieties: sweet and acidic. Sweet is best in sunny areas, while acidic is ideal for areas with partial shade.

      "content": "Sterilize your pruning shears with a bleach-water solution. Using dirty, dull running shears to make cuts on a tree leaves it prone to disease. To combat this, make a solution of 1 part bleach to 3 parts water. Dip your shears in the solution for 5 minutes and rinse them with hot water. Then, dry them with a clean towel. [6] X Research source Alternatively, use 1 part rubbing alcohol or denatured ethanol with 1 part of water. [7] X Research source Sterilizing your solution reduces the chances of spreading disease amongst healthy trees. If possible, sharpen shears with a diamond file to limit damage to the wood on your cherry tree."

      "content": "Cut 24 to 36 inches (61.0 to 91.4 cm) off the top of the central trunk at a 45-degree angle. Cutting the top of the tree is called heading. It's one of the most common techniques to redirect branching and produce new leaves. [8] X Research source With your sterilized, sharpened shears, trim the central trunk at a 45-degree angle so it's between 24 to 36 inches (61.0 to 91.4 cm) in height. Heading the tree will reduce the potential for disease and rot. Do this within the first year or two of planting the tree during the summer. [9] X Research source Heading cuts should only be performed on the top of the cherry tree and not near where the cherries eventually fruit, as this can cause reactive growth at the point of the cut. [10] X Research source If you wait until spring, the tree will have developed buds, and the energy that goes into bud formation will be wasted. Cutting before the buds have formed allows the tree to use that energy to produce healthy branches."

      "content": "Create a scaffold whorl after the first dormant season with 4 branches. After planting the cherry tree for a year, remove the central lead in the summer to redirect tree growth toward three or four strong scaffolds. A scaffold whorl is a set of 4 lateral branches that extend from the tree to provide structure and balance. Select four to five healthy branches spaced 8 inches (20 cm) apart to form your scaffold. The lowest branch should be 18 inches (45.7 cm) above the ground. [11] X Research source If you attempt to make a scaffold too yearly, you may hurt your cherry tree. Opt for branches growing at a 45 to 60-degree angle."

Using pruners, make an angled cut 1 ⁄ 4 inch (0.6 cm) above the buds on the branches. New growth will emerge when you make these cuts. Dispose of the cut branches in a waste or compost bin. [12] X Research source Opt for loppers or a tree saw if your branches are too thick for pruners."

      "content": "Keep two secondary branches on each branch on your scaffold whorl. Look for two well-spaced, strong secondary branches to keep on each branch you just cut. Trim back the remaining branches at an angle, leaving the two strongest branches on each piece of your scaffold. This will help the tree focus its energy on the branches that remain and produce a greater concentration of fruit. [13] X Research source"

      "content": "Trim back the remaining branches and leave an open center. Make clean, angled cuts against the main tree so only the branches that are part of the scaffold remain. Cherry trees require airflow to grow correctly. Your hand should be able to pass through the tree's center without hitting other branches. [14] X Research source Avoid making cuts that are flush to the main branch. An angled cut helps water and rainfall run off the tree, keeping the cherry tree healthy. If a young tree has any broken limbs and crossing branches, remove them.

Assess the tree and determine which branches you want to keep to create a second scaffold that's two feet higher than the first one. This should be carried out no later than August. [16] X Research source Choose branches that don't fall directly over the older primary branches. Create a scaffolded shape so that sunlight can reach the tree branches."

[17] X Research source It's best to trim back vertical branches during the summer since outward-growing branches bear more fruit than the latter. If a new shoot is too long, cut it back by a third or half. [18] X Research source Loppers and pruning saws are suitable pruning tools for trees that are too thick to handle with pruning shears. Be sure your tools are sharp and clean before you use them."

If this happens, prune away the branch, whether it’s dormant or not. The disease might spread to other parts of the tree if you don't remove it right away. If you're working with a diseased tree, clean the pruning tools you use between every cut. Dip them in a bleach solution, wash them with hot water, and dry them off before proceeding. After you cut, cover the exposed cut with salve to protect it."

This helps redirect the tree's energy into its main branches instead of growing new shoots or flowers that will only be cut off. However, the Royal Horticultural Society recommends pruning after harvesting in late July or August in the Northern Hemisphere. During this season, silver leaf disease and bacterial canker are less prominent.

In the same way pruning back branches helps the cherry tree grow, fruit trimming is essentially the process of cutting back fruit. The thinning process helps the tree grow adequate size and quality fruit while increasing the plant's ability to form more buds the following season. Use shears and start at one end of a branch, leaving one fruit every 6 to 10 inches (15 to 25 cm).
