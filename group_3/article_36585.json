      "title": "Assess whether a growth is a wart.",
      "content": "Assess whether a growth is a wart. Dog warts, or sebaceous gland cysts, are a type of benign skin mass that appears in dogs as they age, similar to how moles appear in humans. Other growths can also occur on a dog’s body. Some examples include skin tags , mast cell tumors, histiocytomas, hair follicle tumors, collagenous nevi, and fibromas. [1] X Research source If you are ever in doubt as to whether the growth you are seeing on your dog is a simple wart or some other disease, consult your veterinarian. They can draw some of the cells out of the growth and examine it under the microscope to give you an accurate diagnosis."

      "title": "Examine the appearance of the wart.",
      "content": "Examine the appearance of the wart. The papillomavirus causes true warts and is usually found in puppies or older dogs with an imbalance in their immune system. These warts look like cauliflower stalks and typically appear along the nose, lips, or gums. The warts usually disappear after a few months as the immune system develops, but they can be contagious and make it difficult for your dog to swallow or breathe. [2] X Research source Common, benign warts are flesh-colored and small. They tend to look like tiny mushrooms. If a benign wart grows or looks inflamed, you may need to remove it. You cannot always tell by looking at it if it is a cancerous tumor or not. Many times, cancerous warts are black, quick-growing, and inflamed. They generally form around the eyelids or lips and should be removed as soon as possible."

      "title": "Chart the growth of the wart.",
      "content": "Chart the growth of the wart. As long as a wart does not increase in size or change shape, you probably do not need to remove it. You should, however, make your vet aware of any warts your dog develops so that they can also keep track of them. Many warts disappear on their own, but even those that persist generally remain harmless."

      "title": "Consider whether or not the wart poses a problem.",
      "content": "Consider whether or not the wart poses a problem. You can remove a wart merely for cosmetic purposes, but it is generally not recommended to perform surgery for that reason alone. If, however, a benign wart keeps getting snagged, causes your dog to itch and scratch, or otherwise makes your dog uncomfortable, you may opt to have it removed. [3] X Research source Your veterinarian can also give you guidance as to whether the wart needs removal. Warts that the dog can irritate by scratching or rubbing or that rubs against a collar are best removed to avoid repeated infections and inflammation. Itching can sometimes signal that the wart is cancerous and should be removed."

      "title": "Chart the progress of any treatment you choose.",
      "content": "Chart the progress of any treatment you choose. On the first day before treatment, chart the wart. Photograph the existing wart (or mole) to establish a baseline. Use a metric ruler to measure the wart in millimeters. Date the photograph, circle day one of treatment on the calendar, and write down the measurements. As long as you are positive that your dog only has a benign (non-cancerous) wart, you can try some of these holistic treatments. Remember that no scientific evidence supports the efficacy of any of these methods. So, if the wart turns black, grows quickly, or becomes inflamed, bring your pet to a licensed veterinarian for medical treatment."

These treatments can continue for up to 8 weeks. While you can avoid surgery and the associated risks, this treatment can cause a number of side effects, including fever and loss of appetite."

      "content": "Ask your vet to perform electrocautery. When performing electrocautery, also called electrosurgery, the veterinarian uses a small tool to apply a small, concentrated amount of electricity to the wart. This electricity burns away the contaminated tissue, thereby removing the wart. The surgery is usually performed under local anesthesia, making it a good option if you worry about the risks involved in knocking your dog out with general anesthesia."

Freezing destroys the diseased tissue, shrinking the wart significantly and, in many cases, causing it to disappear entirely.

During a traditional excision, the vet simply cuts the wart and contaminated tissue away using a medical scalpel. [14] X Research source Your vet may wait to excise warts until your dog goes under general anesthesia for another reason, as putting a dog under is an extreme measure to put a dog through to remove warts."
