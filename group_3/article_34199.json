[1] X Research source To make this process easier, it’s best to use machine-washable shower curtains . Here’s how to wash each individual component: Fabric curtain: Wash the curtain in your washing machine according to the instructions on the care label, and add 1 cup (236 mL) of vinegar during the rinse cycle. Let the curtain air dry. Plastic liner: Put the plastic liner in the washing machines with some bath towels, and wash them on a delicate cycle with cold water. Add ½ cup (136 g) baking soda and 1 ⁄ 4 cup (59 ml) vinegar during the rinse cycle. Allow the liner to air dry—the heat from the dryer can melt it. Rod and rings: Spray the rod and rings with a commercial bathroom cleaner or an all-purpose cleaner. Wipe them down with a clean cloth to remove residue. [2] X Research source"

To prevent your bathroom from becoming humid while you shower, make sure the area is well ventilated. If you can, leave the bathroom door open and crack a window. It also helps to turn on the exhaust fan and leave it on until about 30 minutes after your shower is over.

      "title": "Mold grows on shower curtains because they get wet frequently.",
      "content": "Mold grows on shower curtains because they get wet frequently. “Every day, the shower curtain gets wet,” explains Kapur. “Moisture always goes there,” and mold needs moisture to thrive. Beyond this, mold tends to grow in warm, damp areas, so your bathroom becomes the perfect breeding ground for it when it gets hot and steamy from your shower. There are thousands of known species of mold, so you won’t be able to identify the specific type of mold that’s grown in your home without sending it to a lab to be analyzed, explains Kapur. All mold can be harmful to your health, so you'll need to remove it regardless. The most common types of mold that grow inside people's homes are Cladosporium , Penicillium , and Aspergillus. [13] X Trustworthy Source Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Main public health institute for the US, run by the Dept. of Health and Human Services Go to source Kapur adds that, most of the time, shower curtains will grow mildew, rather than full-on mold. Mildew is technically categorized as mold, but he describes it as “a nicer cousin of mold” because it doesn’t entrench itself as deeply on surfaces, so it's easier to remove."

      "title": "It’s important to prevent mold because it can cause health problems.",
      "content": "It’s important to prevent mold because it can cause health problems. A colony of mold releases spores and microscopic toxins called mycotoxins into the air, which you can then breathe in. Prolonged exposure to these toxins and spores can cause a runny nose, coughing, congestion, headaches, skin rashes, asthma and changes to your immune system. Because of this, it’s crucial to prevent mold growth and eliminate it if it does show up in your home. People who already have asthma, are allergic to mold, are immune compromised, or have lung disease are more at risk for having negative reactions to mold.

If you’re really opposed to throwing away your moldy curtain and/or liner, your best course of action will probably be soaking it in a bleach solution. Fill a large bucket or your bathtub with water, and add 1 ⁄ 4 cup (59 mL) bleach per each gallon of water. Soak the curtain for at least 8 hours. [16] X Research source Make sure the area is well ventilated, so you’re not exposed to bleach fumes. Open windows and make sure there’s lots of fresh air circulating in the room. [17] X Trustworthy Source Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Main public health institute for the US, run by the Dept. of Health and Human Services Go to source If your shower curtain still has mold on it after soaking, or if the mold grows back quickly, it’s best to toss it out and replace it. Keep in mind that this method will likely only be possible for plastic curtains and liners, since bleach may discolor fabric curtains."
