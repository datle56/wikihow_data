Since this is a short roll, the gauntlet button will help keep the look sleek and clean.

      "content": "Fold the cuff at the seam between the cuff and the sleeve. Run your fingers through the fold along the seam so that the fold is clean and uniform all around the cuff. The width of the cuff determines the width of your next roll. [3] X Research source If you have a stiff dress shirt cuff, resist the urge to fold it in half to make a thinner roll (it will crease the cuff permanently and the roll will turn out bulkier). Fold softer cuffs in half if you really want a thin roll, but remember that folding along the cuff seam looks cleaner."

      "content": "Fold the cuff over one more time to complete the roll. Run your fingers through the fold to make sure the cuff is settled flat for a thin, effortless-looking roll. Adjust the corners so they’re crisp and tidy to maintain a professional, formal vibe. [4] X Research source Since only about a third of your arm is showing, you’ll still have that classy, button-up look. [5] X Research source Feel free to push the cuff up closer to your elbow to temporarily get it out of the way or look a bit more casual without making additional folds. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Repeat on your other sleeve. Make sure both rolls look equally crisp and clean to show that you made an intentional stylistic choice. Since you used the cuff to measure your rolls, you won’t have to worry about them being the same length. [7] X Research source If you’re wearing a tie, keep it on and fastened with this sleeve roll."

      "title": "Unbutton the cuff and gauntlet buttons.",
      "content": "Unbutton the cuff and gauntlet buttons. Gauntlet buttons are the small buttons along the split in your sleeve above the cuff. If you have multiple gauntlet buttons, undo at least one—you can undo additional ones as you roll if the sleeve starts to feel restrictive. [8] X Research source If you have thinner arms, consider keeping at least one gauntlet button done so the cuff hugs your arm a bit more closely."

      "content": "Fold the cuff at or just above the seam between the cuff and the sleeve. The cuff will determine the width of your rolls all the way up your forearm. Make sure you’re folding on the seam and not within the cuff itself—the roll will end up looking bulky, and the stuff cuff of your dress shirt will be permanently creased. Run a finger through the fold so that the inside-out cuff lays as flat as possible. Even though softer and less formal shirt cuffs can be folded outside the seam, it will look bulkier in the long run as you add more rolls."

      "content": "Fold your sleeve over the cuff so it’s inside-out. Straighten out your sleeve so the fabric isn’t baggy on the upper part of your arm, and run a finger through the fold to make sure the cuff is settled neatly inside. Feel how tight this double roll feels. If it’s restrictive, undo a gauntlet button to loosen it up. [9] X Research source If you’re in a formal setting, consider stopping here (the classic roll). Continue rolling if you’re transitioning to a casual environment or need to keep your sleeves clean."

[10] X Research source Use the cuff as a guide to determine how wide to make each roll, making sure to smooth out and adjust the fabric after each one. Fold until the top of the roll is most of the way up your forearm, just below the elbow. Depending on the length of your sleeve, this may take 1-2 folds. Stop here if you don’t plan on doing any heavy physical activity. Make sure both rolls are equally tidy and the same length. [11] X Research source If you’re wearing a tie, keep it on to maintain a professional look. If you’re at a function like a happy hour, consider loosening it slightly. Keep your cuff below the elbow to stay on the more formal side of things. As a general rule, the more arm you show, the more casual the look."

Flatten out the folds for a clean look. This look is more casual and will definitely hug and show off your bicep for a “guns out” look. [12] X Research source This look is best if you have to use your arms for intense physical activity and don’t want to stretch or wear out the elbows of your sleeves. The “High Roller” is more casual than either a basic below-the-elbow roll or the classic roll. If you have a tie on, consider loosening or even taking it off."

Check that all of your gauntlet buttons are undone, otherwise the end result will feel very tight and restrictive against your elbow. This fold works great on stiff, formal shirts but works on softer, more casual materials like flannel, too. [14] X Research source Gauntlet buttons are the smaller buttons along the split in your sleeve above the cuff. Most button-downs and dress shirts have at least one per sleeve."

Rather than folding at the cuff seam like other rolls, pull the cuff up your arm (turning your sleeve inside-out as you go) and stop when the bottom of the cuff is just above your elbow. [15] X Research source You should still have the upper part of your forearm covered by the inside-out shirt sleeve. Depending on your preference, adjust the height of the cuff to sit just above or just below the elbow. Remember, a high roll is typically seen as more casual. This roll is very versatile since you can adjust the height to be whatever you like."

[16] X Research source Smooth out the edges of the fold so the roll lays flat and clean. If desired, adjust how much of the cuff is showing above the fold. If the inside of your cuff contrasts with the print or color of your shirt, let a full third of it show. It’s a very striking, stylish, attention-grabbing look. [17] X Research source"

It might take a few tries to find the perfect height. Once that’s decided, fold the other sleeve to the exact same height. [18] X Research source Make sure the same amount of cuff is exposed on both sleeves, too. Use this roll as a classy alternative to a classic or basic roll. It looks stylish and intentional in comparison, especially if the inside of the cuff has an interesting color or pattern. [19] X Research source If you’re wearing a tie , keep it fastened if your roll is lower and more formal. Loosen it if the roll is higher and you’re in a more casual setting."

If your sleeves are extra long and you have a lot of fabric to get out of the way, place it slightly lower so you have room to push it up later. [20] X Research source If you don’t have a garter, use a rubber band or hair tie in its place. Just make sure it’s not too tight and won’t cut off your circulation. Use garters with dress shirts, button-downs, or any shirt where you don’t want to stretch out or stress the cuffs."

The band holds the sleeve tight, so just nudge it upwards to pull your cuffs away from your wrists. Let the top portion of your sleeves billow out a little bit for an effortless look.

If you’ve got lots of billowy fabric up top or just want to cover up the band or garter, tug and fold the excess neatly over it. This creates a cleaner, more intentional look (especially if you’re using a rubber band in place of a garter). [22] X Research source If you like the idea of a garter but don’t want it to show, try using it inside a classic, basic, or master roll to hold it in place."

Keep other bold accessories like bowties, fedoras, or suspenders to a minimum so you look well-dressed . All of these together can be distracting in an office or formal setting. [23] X Research source The best accessory to pair with sleeve garters is confidence—they’ll definitely set you and your outfit apart from the crowd, so own it! Garters were popular in the early 20th century when dress shirts often didn’t have buttons on the cuffs and it was harder to find sleeves in various lengths."

      "content": "Grab two elastic bands, like hair ties or rubber bands. Make sure they’re big enough to fit comfortably around both your arm and the sweater sleeve. Hair ties are generally more comfortable than rubber bands, and thicker bands constrict your circulation less than thin ones. [24] X Research source Elastic is a great way to hold saggy sweater sleeves in place. Since the fabric is looser than dress shirts, they’re likely to slip no matter how tight you roll them."

Adjust your final roll to make the “cuff” look tidy. If you like, slide the band up closer to your shoulder to make the upper part a little baggier. Keep the cuff below the elbow unless the sweater is very thin, otherwise the portion around your upper arm will look too bulky. [27] X Research source The band will keep the sleeve in place all day long. No more worrying about baggy sleeves getting in the way! Rolled sweater sleeves usually look better and more casual when they’re below the elbow. Otherwise, your upper arm will look super bulky. Remember, rolled sweater sleeves will always be a casual look. Do this when you need to get your sleeves out of the way or to cool down."
