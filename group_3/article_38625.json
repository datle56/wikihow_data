Check in with yourself and ask yourself where you're feeling your emotions—maybe your stomach feels tight or your heart is racing. To give yourself some relief, continue to inhale and exhale. Imagine a safe place, like a garden, so you can distract yourself from worrying about your partner. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Find ways to enjoy yourself \"in the now\" to combat anxiety. Appeal to your 5 senses while you \"ground\" —calm—yourself. For example, put on some calming music, brew some fragrant tea or hot chocolate, wrap yourself in a blanket, and sip your treat. Inhale and exhale while you comfort yourself. This exercise in mindfulness can help you associate solitude with relaxation and even fun. When all of your 5 senses are catered to, it's a lot easier to settle down instead of ruminating on the past or worrying about the future."

      "content": "Writing your emotions down can help you unpack them. When you're really anxious, everything might feel like a blur. Take out a pen and paper and reflect on what you're going through right now. Are you upset? Insecure? Afraid? What triggered—or started—your episode of anxiety? Is your partner hanging out with a friend and you're worried they're flirting? Has it been a while since you heard from your significant other? Try to connect your emotions with a situation that has evoked them. When you gain this clarity, you'll have more self-awareness about what bothers you. [2] X Trustworthy Source Science Direct Online archive of peer-reviewed research on scientific, technical and medical topics Go to source As you journal, pinpoint what's troubling you about your relationship. You might notice some patterns. For example, you might write: \"Sometimes I worry that Katie isn't very attracted to me and will leave me for someone else. I noticed she wasn't all that romantic this week.\" Think of yourself like the sky and your emotions like the weather: feelings come and go, but you're always you. Your mood isn't permanent, and the more you acknowledge your attitude, the more you can work through it and change it."

      "content": "Question worst case scenarios so you can expect the best. Anxious attachment might cause you to invent all types of reasons for why your partner is gone or \"ignoring\" you. If you notice a critical inner voice, acknowledge it, but then shut it down and remind yourself that it's all pure fiction. To debunk it, tell yourself it's just anxiety that's speaking and that it's not true. Negative thought: \"Katie is always gone because she can't stand my company. She's eventually going to leave me. It's obvious.\" Challenging comment: \"That's just a negative thought pattern that comes up due to my anxiety. It's not grounded in reality.\""

Since imagining worst case scenarios is very likely to increase anxiety, try to lower your stress by looking at your circumstances in a new light. Be as optimistic as you possibly can. For some inspiration, check out this example of positive reframing: [3] X Research source Negative thought: \"Katie sure spends a lot of time with her friends. I guess she just doesn't need me anymore.\" Positive reframing: \"Katie has a really active social life! That's so important. I'm glad that she has such a wonderful support network.\""

      "content": "Focus on how to take care of your own needs. When you're anxiously attached, it's easy to put your partner on a pedestal. After all, your first instincts might be to get their approval at any cost. If you notice this type of pattern, pause and seriously consider what makes you happy . Make sure you're always your #1 priority. Celebrate who you are and make time for activities that spark joy for you. [4] X Research source Try not to make any sacrifices or compromises that benefit your partner at your expense. For example, if they don't like tennis but you do, feel free to hit the courts with a friend. It's completely fine to pursue interests on your own. Really reflect on what defines and fulfills you: \"Ultimately, my life doesn't revolve around Katie, even though I love her. I am really active, artistic, and caring. That makes me wonderful to be around, and it's okay to take part in all my hobbies without her.\""

Oftentimes, \"what if?\" scenarios can pop up in the middle of the night, especially if they go to bed alone. No matter what you're going through, make sure to get a solid 7-9 hours of rest. Proper sleep is important for your mental health, and everything will look better in the morning. [5] X Research source Try little rituals that can help you get to sleep more quickly.

      "content": "Exercise to lower your stress. Unresolved anxiety can result in pent-up emotions, like frustration or fear. Luckily, exercise is a great outlet that reduces tension and increases the levels of \"feel-good\" chemicals, like endorphins and serotonin. Pick up any activity that gets your blood pumping and excites you, like jogging, dancing, or weight training. Before you know it, you might really get in the zone and forget what was worrying you in the first place.

      "content": "Remind yourself that have other allies on your side. While it's amazing to have a partner that thinks the world of you, it's important to be surrounded by friends, too. Make sure to invest in your inner circle, which might include childhood buddies, new acquaintances, colleagues, relatives, and mentors. When you cast a wide net and speak to all the positive influences in your life, you'll realize that so many people care about you—your significant other isn't the only one! [8] X Research source Try to make it a regular habit to check in with the people you care about. For example, text your best friend once a week, or pencil in a brunch with a group of buddies every month. If you need some extra help, communicate with someone whom you trust. For example, instead of just turning to your partner, ask a mentor something like, \"Would you be free to look over my college applications? I want to see if the tone is right.\" Be sure to reach out for genuine connections and sincere conversation rather than using others to self-regulate and soothe your emotions."
