[1] X Research source However, the type of exercise and your level of soreness matter. If, for example, you just started an intense new workout, pull back for 1-2 days and build back up to it over 1-2 weeks. If you're in a lot of pain, though, it might be best to work out other muscle groups while you recover, or take time to rest. [2] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source You can also switch to a recovery exercise like swimming , yoga , or walking until your muscles feel better. These types of movements might even relieve pain more than not exercising at all. [3] X Research source"

Switch to gentler exercises like swimming, yoga, walking, or jogging. Light exercise will help increase the blood flow to your sore muscles and help them return to normal faster than rest alone.

      "content": "Work out other muscle groups that aren't sore. We have muscles all over our bodies, and we don't always exercise them all at the same time. So, if you feel soreness in just one particular muscle group, such as your biceps or upper body, rest that area for a few days and switch your focus to muscle groups where the pain is lesser or you can't feel it at all. [6] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source For example, instead of doing bicep curls and straining your sore arms, do squats or leg presses that concentrate the exercise in the lower half of your body."

      "content": "Intense exercise can cause microtears and inflammation in your muscles. When you exercise muscles in your body that you're not used to exercising—or alternatively, if you raise the intensity of your workout to a new level—you might suffer microtears and low levels of inflammation in your muscle fibers. [7] X Research source This is why both beginner and advanced workouts can cause soreness. The pain level is relative to the person's physical fitness and how hard they push themselves during exercise."

      "content": "Most people don't feel sore until a day or two after exercising. This phenomenon is called Delayed Onset Muscle Soreness (DOMS). Experts don't know exactly why the pain is delayed, but it's perfectly normal as long as it goes away after 4-5 days. [8] X Research source If it doesn't, that could be a sign that you're injured, not just sore."

There are only so many repairing tissues in the body at one time. Training, when that muscle group is sore, is called over training and leads to a lack of immunity.\" After that, she says, you're more likely to become injured or even fall sick."

Massages also help reduce any swelling you may have after your workout. Keep in mind, though, that a massage won't speed up your recovery time. But it's quite effective for providing immediate relief from soreness. [9] X Research source If you can't get to a masseuse, try self-massaging with a foam roller right after your workout."

Instead of immediately launching yourself into a new, longer workout where you're pushing yourself harder than ever, work up to it slowly. Experts recommend taking at least 1-2 weeks to build up to more intense exercise.

      "title": "Stretch or do other warm-ups before and after exercising.",
      "content": "Stretch or do other warm-ups before and after exercising. Stretching your muscles helps break up muscle adhesion, which is when the fascia that holds your muscles together crinkles instead of staying smooth and slippery. Muscle adhesion makes it harder for your muscles to move and can increase your risk of soreness or injury. Stretching helps loosen the fascia. [15] X Trustworthy Source Johns Hopkins Medicine Official resource database of the world-leading Johns Hopkins Hospital Go to source Take a few minutes to stretch before and after exercising, so you can reduce the risk of injuring your muscles."

But complex carbohydrates are also important and can aid in recovery from DOMS just as much. [16] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Medical School Harvard Medical School's Educational Site for the Public Go to source Incorporate at least1.1-1.5 g (0.04-0.05 oz) of protein (i.e., lean meat, fish, protein drinks, milk) for every 1 kilogram (2.2 pounds) of body weight per day if you exercise regularly. [17] X Research source Make sure you're also getting 5-7 g (0.2-0.3 oz) of complex carbs (i.e., fiber-rich fruits and vegetables, whole grains, beans) per 1 kg (2.2 lb) of body weight daily, especially if you engage in moderate to high-intensity exercises. [18] X Research source If you perform endurance exercises that last for several hours (like marathons), you may need to consume 6-10 g (0.2-0.4 oz) of carbs per 1 kg (2.2 lb) of body weight on those days or consider carb loading ."

Unlike muscle soreness, which usually feels like all-over tenderness, injury pain is sharp and concentrated in one location. Check for a bruise and swelling in the area where it hurts the most, as those are signs of injury, as well. Finally, the pain either won't go away on its own, even after several days, or it may start to feel numb in the affected area. These are all signs you may have pulled or sprained a muscle and should see a doctor immediately. [20] X Research source"
