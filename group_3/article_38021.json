      "content": "Determine your computer's USB port type. There are two main types of USB ports found on modern computers: USB 3.0 — A thin, rectangular slot that's about 3/4 of an inch (a little under two centimeters) wide. You should see a chunk of plastic in the upper half of this slot. USB 3.0 slots are found on the majority of Windows computers and on most Mac computers manufactured prior to 2016. USB-C — A thin, oval slot that's about 1/2 of an inch (a little over a centimeter) wide. These are most commonly found on MacBook and MacBook Pro computers, though some Windows laptops also have USB-C ports. If your computer has both types of port, you're free to use whichever port you like depending on your USB flash drive type."

If the flash drive that you want to use is a USB 3.0 version but your computer uses USB-C ports, you'll need to buy a USB-C adapter and plug it into the USB-C port on your computer. This is most common on MacBooks and MacBook Pros from 2016 and up, though some Windows computers also have only USB-C ports."
