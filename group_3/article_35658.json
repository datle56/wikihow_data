      "content": "Take off any tight-fitting clothes. Clothes that constrict your waist, legs, or thighs can cause swelling in your legs. Take off any clothes that might be squeezing your legs and put on something loose and comfortable instead. [1] X Trustworthy Source MedlinePlus Collection of medical information sourced from the US National Library of Medicine Go to source Avoid tight leggings, jeans, pants, or garters.

      "content": "Elevate your leg above your heart. Sit back or lie down and use pillows, blankets, or an ottoman to elevate your swollen leg to a level above your heart. Alternatively, lie down on your bed or a yoga mat with your legs propped up along the wall or bedhead at a 90° angle. [2] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Stay in this position for 15-30 minutes at a time, or longer if you’re comfortable. Repeat this 3-4 times a day for as long as the swelling continues. Elevating your legs helps relieve pressure and reduce water retention in your legs. This can be especially helpful if you’ve been sitting or standing in the same position for extended periods of time. If you can, try putting several blocks (like exercise blocks) under your mattress so that you can keep your legs elevated as you sleep.

      "content": "Massage your leg to improve circulation. Self-massage can help reduce swelling caused by pregnancy, edema , water retention, extended sitting, or a high-sodium diet. Use comfortably firm (not painful) strokes to massage the swollen leg, moving up your leg in the direction of your heart. [3] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Repeat this process for 20 minutes at a time, 1-2 times a day. Combine massage with elevation to help pull the built-up fluids and blood from your legs. Lie down with your legs straight up against a wall or the head of your bed, and massage one leg at a time in this position. If you have the means, you can also seek help from a massage therapist. A standard Swedish massage will generally do the trick. If you have more severe swelling, though, you may want to look for a therapist who practices specialized treatment for swelling."

If you have to stand for work, talk to your manager about ensuring you get regular breaks, or otherwise seeking accommodations to minimize the amount of time you have to stand. [5] X Research source Ideally, you should get at least 15 minutes off your feet every 2-3 hours. Doing so can help provide immediate relief to swelling caused by extended periods of standing still. If you cannot get the breaks you require, see if other accommodations can be made. If, for example, you work as a cashier, ask your manager about getting a stool behind the register."
