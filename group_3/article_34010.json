    {
      "title": "Familiarize yourself with the job posting you applied for.",
      "content": "Familiarize yourself with the job posting you applied for. Take a look at the job posting and glance over the qualifications and the skills needed. Try to remember these during your interview so you can highlight how your job history and skills fit in with the job opening. [1] X Research source For example, the job posting might say you need excellent time management skills and close attention to detail. When you get to the interview, you can talk about how you’ve used those skills in the past."

      "title": "Research the company and its history.",
      "content": "Research the company and its history. Head over to the company website and learn a little more about what they do.

    {
      "title": "Learn more about the company culture on social media.",
      "content": "Learn more about the company culture on social media.

They may talk about work-life balance, fun projects, or even employee accomplishments. [3] X Research source If the company doesn’t have a blog or a social media page, that’s fine too. Just spend time looking through their website."

    {
      "title": "Look over your resumé and your own qualifications.",
      "content": "Look over your resumé and your own qualifications. Your interviewer will probably have a copy of your resumé in front of them when they start asking questions. Make sure you can talk about specific projects or job duties and how they relate to the job you’re applying for. [4] X Research source You should pay special attention to your “skills” or “qualifications” section since that’s where you get to talk about why you’re a good fit for the job."

      "title": "Practice answering interview questions with a friend.",
      "content": "Practice answering interview questions with a friend. It might sound silly, but holding a mock interview can be super helpful in the days before your real one.

      "title": "Have an explanation for any gaps on your resumé.",
      "content": "Have an explanation for any gaps on your resumé. If you were unemployed for any length of time, your interviewer may ask about it. Try to come up with some skills or qualities you gained during your time off to make up for the lack of job experience. For example: [6] X Research source If you were caring for a sick loved one, you can talk about how it helped you gain perspective on the world. If you were traveling, you can talk about how you experience diverse cultures and how you’d use those experiences in the workplace."
    },
    {
      "title": "Play up your strengths.",
      "content": "Play up your strengths. During the interview, you might be asked about what you do well. Try to come up with 2 to 3 examples of skills you’ve used in the workplace that you could transfer to your new job. For example, you could say: [7] X Research source “At my last job, I was in charge of our weekly team meetings. I used my skills as a leader and as a team player to make sure everyone felt involved and like they had a say in what was going on.” “My previous role as a customer service rep taught me a lot about communication and the importance of attentive listening.”"

    {
      "title": "Explain why you want to work for the company.",
      "content": "Explain why you want to work for the company. Your interviewer might ask you what made you apply for the position that you did.

Try something like: [8] X Research source “When I saw the listing for an accountant at your company, I was intrigued. I heard about how well your company treats its employees, and I’m interested in the projects that you do.” “My background is in biology, and I’ve always been interested in animals. When the position for a zookeeper opened up, I knew I had to jump on it.”"

    {
      "title": "Talk about how your skills apply to the job.",
      "content": "Talk about how your skills apply to the job. This is another way you can talk about your strengths, but you can make them specific to the job description. Use real examples of things you did in previous workplaces to talk about why you’d be a good fit. [9] X Research source You might say, “As a general contractor, I learned a lot about the inner workings of the construction field. Since I have so many years of experience, I know that I could run a construction team efficiently.” Or, “When I was a waiter, I learned how to multitask and use my time wisely. I think that I can transfer those skills into a managerial position easily, especially since I know how to run the front of the house.”"

      "title": "Think of 2 to 3 questions to ask your interviewer.",
      "content": "Think of 2 to 3 questions to ask your interviewer. At the end of the interview, your interviewer will probably ask if you have any questions for them about the job or the company. You can use the company website and your background knowledge to ask a few questions like: [10] X Research source What does a typical work day look like? What are the most immediate projects that need to be addressed? What are the biggest challenges that someone in this position would face? Can you show me examples of projects I’d be working on?"

      "content": "Get there at least 5 minutes early. Showing up on time makes a good first impression, so try not to be late.

[13] X Research source Make your travel arrangements well ahead of the day of the interview. Showing up on time can mean the difference between getting the job and not getting the job."
