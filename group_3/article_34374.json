If you want to use the XR16 remote to control audio components like soundbars and receivers, turn those on as well. The XR16 is the only Xfinity remote that doesn't have a numeric keypad, which makes it pretty recognizable. One of the best things about the XR16 remote and Flex Box is that you don't have to track down the component codes for your TV and other devices—the Flex Box does that for you!"
