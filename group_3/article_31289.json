      "content": "See a dermatologist for a correct diagnosis. While you might want to avoid seeing the doctor, granuloma annulare is tough to diagnose on your own. While it's harmless, other conditions could present a similar rash. That’s why it’s important to see a dermatologist and rule out other causes. With an examination, the dermatologist can confirm that you have granuloma annulare and recommend the next steps for treatment. [1] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Dermatology Professional organization made of over 20,000 certified dermatologists Go to source Granuloma takes a few months at least to clear on its own, so the rash won’t disappear suddenly. This is a tell-tale sign of granuloma. Granuloma is often mistaken for ringworm, a fungal infection that clears up with antifungal cream. The most common form of this condition is localized granuloma annulare. This causes small red bumps in a limited area that merge into a circular rash. Different forms could present a rash over a wider area, small bumps under the skin, or a scaly, itchy skin irritation. All are harmless and treated in the same ways.

      "content": "Inform the dermatologist if you’ve recently traveled or received an injury. Doctors aren’t sure what triggers granuloma, and it probably has multiple causes. However, it may be associated with a recent injury or exposure to some kind of unfamiliar chemical. This could happen while you’re traveling or working around corrosive chemicals. In any case, inform the dermatologist of any injuries you’ve had, traveling you’ve done, or chemicals you’ve been exposed to. [3] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Dermatology Professional organization made of over 20,000 certified dermatologists Go to source There is no particular locations where you might get granuloma from. However, since insect or animal bites and sun exposure can trigger it, then tropical locations could put you at a higher risk. Granuloma may also be from an autoimmune response, in which case there really is no trigger."

      "content": "Have a biopsy to make sure the rash isn’t malignant. The dermatologist may be able to recognize granuloma with just a physical exam, but it’s common to do a biopsy on any skin rashes to check for skin cancer. Don’t worry if your dermatologist does this test–in most cases this is entirely routine and comes back negative. The dermatologist will take a small skin sample from the rash and look at it under a microscope to rule out skin cancer.

This is to rule out other conditions like ringworm, which causes a similar rash.

The rash is harmless and most cases clear up in a few months to 2 years. This may seem like a long time, but it’s possible that trying to treat the rash will cause more problems. Follow your dermatologist's recommendation for the next steps in your treatment. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Apply corticosteroid cream to the affected area. Corticosteroids can heal inflammation on your skin, so this is usually the first treatment that dermatologists recommend to clear the rash. You don’t need a prescription for these medications, so get the type that your dermatologist recommends for you. Then, apply it according to their directions to see if this helps you. [9] X Research source General instructions for corticosteroid creams are to rub it onto the affected area twice a day for 2 weeks, then contact your doctor if you don’t see any improvement. However, follow the specific instructions from your dermatologist or the product directions. [10] X Trustworthy Source MedlinePlus Collection of medical information sourced from the US National Library of Medicine Go to source In some cases, your dermatologist might recommend covering the area with a bandage to keep the medication on your skin."

      "content": "Have steroid injections for a stronger treatment. If creams or vitamins don’t clear the rash, your dermatologist may try injecting corticosteroids under your skin. This delivers a direct dose that might be better for clearing the rash. Usually, the dermatologist will give you an initial round of injections, and then ask you to come back for follow-up injections every few weeks. This might clear the rash within a few months. [11] X Research source Steroid treatments usually work best for localized granuloma that hasn’t spread. If it covers a larger area, then they’ll probably try something else. [12] X Research source"

      "title": "Try light therapy to clear the rash.",
      "content": "Try light therapy to clear the rash. Light therapy uses UV rays to heal problems on your skin. There are two types of light therapy, PUVA and laser treatment. Your dermatologist can do either in their office. For PUVA treatment, you’ll take a drug called psoralen, which makes your skin more sensitive to UV light, and then the dermatologist uses a wand to shine UVA rays onto the rash. For laser treatment, the dermatologist will focus a ray of strong light onto the rash. Both try to prevent inflammation on your skin. You’ll probably need several sessions to see any results. [13] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source For PUVA treatment, you may need to return for a few repeat visits before the rash improves. Laser therapy often shows faster results, but not always. Light treatment and phototherapy slightly increase your risk of skin cancer, but they’re safe as long as you use them exactly as directed.

      "content": "Remove raised lesions by freezing them. This is the most aggressive treatment for granuloma because it involves physically removing the lesions. It’s used if you have raised lesions instead of a simple rash. The dermatologist will freeze the lesions with liquid nitrogen. They’ll then either remove them or let the freezing process destroy them. [15] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source Although a skilled dermatologist can do this without causing injuries, there is always a risk that your skin will scar after this treatment. Consider if this is worth the risk to remove the rash."

      "title": "Take prescription medications for widespread cases.",
      "content": "Take prescription medications for widespread cases. Oral medications are a less common treatment for granuloma, but sometimes they’re necessary for widespread cases. A number of medications might be effective to treat rashes over a wide area. Take the medications that your dermatologist prescribes exactly as they tell you to. [16] X Research source Oral steroids work similarly to topical corticosteroids and can reduce inflammation on your skin. Although granuloma isn’t caused by a bacterial infection, some antibiotics are effective for clearing the rash. Dapsone and Accutane, usually used for acne or dermatitis, might help. Antimalarial drugs like hydroxychloroquine are also effective for treating granuloma. This may be because they suppress your immune system."
