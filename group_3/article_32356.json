      "content": "The Part of Fortune represents where you find luck and worldly success. Also called the lot of fortune or Pars Fortuna, your Part of Fortune is essentially the intersection of your “big three” (Sun, Moon, and Rising signs) on your birth chart. Your Part of Fortune’s sign placement foretells your most lucky or favorable attributes and where in life you’ll be successful.Your Sun, Moon, and Rising (also called “Ascendant”) signs are called the “big three” because they typically present a well-rounded overview of your personality: your core principles and identity (Sun), emotional needs (Moon), and perspective on the world (Rising).Thus, putting the big three together to find your Part of Fortune is thought to reveal a point where things are easier for you or seem to have the most harmony. It also shows how you can use your strengths to navigate challenges (or catch a lucky streak)."

      "content": "Determine whether you have a day chart or a night chart. Depending on whether you have a “day chart” (meaning you were born during the day) or a “night chart” (meaning you were born at night), the formula to calculate your Part of Fortune differs. If your Sun sign falls in houses 7 through 12, you have a day chart. If it falls in 1 through 6, you have a night chart."

      "title": "Find the degree of your Sun, Moon, and Ascendant signs.",
      "content": "Find the degree of your Sun, Moon, and Ascendant signs. There are 30° of each sign (for a total of 360°). Birth charts typically display how many degrees into a sign each placement falls, so first, check yours for each value. For example, if you’re a Virgo Sun, your chart might say “Virgo: 19°,” meaning your Sun placement falls 19 degrees into Virgo. Then, since Virgo starts at 150° on a 360° birth chart, that means your Sun sign is located at 169° on the chart overall (since 150 + 19 = 169).Do this for your Moon and Ascendant signs, too! Using the 360° circle: Aries starts at 0° Taurus starts at 30° Gemini starts at 60° Cancer starts at 90° Leo starts at 120° Virgo starts at 150° Libra starts at 180° Scorpio starts at 210° Sagittarius starts at 240° Capricorn starts at 270° Aquarius starts at 300° Pisces starts at 330°"

      "content": "Follow the day chart formula Ascendant - Sun + Moon. Once you’ve figured out the exact degree of your Sun, Moon, and Ascendant, simply follow the formula to figure out where your Part of Fortune placement falls. If you have a day chart, subtract your Sun sign from your Ascendant and then add your Moon. [1] X Research source For example: Say your Sun sign in Virgo is 169°, your Moon sign in Taurus is 33° and your Ascendant in Libra is 200°. That means the formula for your Part of Fortune would be 200° - 169° + 33°. The result is 64°, which means your Part of Fortune placement would be in Gemini (since Gemini starts at 60° and ends at 90° on a 360° birth chart)."

If you have a night chart, use the same degree values for your Sun, Moon, and Ascendant in a slightly different order. Add your Sun and Ascendant, then subtract your Moon to find your Part of Fortune placement. [2] X Research source For example: Say your Sun sign is Aquarius at 323° (300 as the starting point for Aquarius + 23 degrees into Aquarius on your birth chart). Then, say your Moon sign is Leo at 146° and your Ascendant in Libra at 180°. That means your formula would be 180 + 323 - 146. The result is 357°, which means your Part of Fortune would fall in Pisces (since Pisces starts at 330° and ends at 360°)."

      "title": "Look for planets that are conjunct your Part of Fortune.",
      "content": "Look for planets that are conjunct your Part of Fortune. While all sign placements for your Part of Fortune have benefits, a conjunct is particularly meaningful. When your Part of Fortune forms a conjunction with a point or planet (meaning it falls next to them), it’s an indicator of likely career paths, talents, and paths to success for you. For example, a Part of Fortune conjunct with Jupiter (the planet of luck) is especially powerful. It signifies that you’ll be especially lucky in whatever areas of life are represented in your Part of Fortune sign placement. So, if you have a conjunct with Jupiter and your Part of Fortune is in Leo, that means you’ll be especially lucky when embracing self-expression to the fullest."

It’s associated with fate, and it’s believed to reflect your life’s spiritual purpose. Thus, when your North Node is conjunct with your Part of Fortune, it indicates your potential to make a lasting impact on the world.
