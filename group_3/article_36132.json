    {
      "title": "Remove any blueberry chunks from the fabric and blot away excess juice.",
      "content": "Remove any blueberry chunks from the fabric and blot away excess juice. Use a spoon, knife, or napkin to lift away pieces of the berry, being careful not to drop or smear them on other parts of the fabric. Use a clean cloth or napkin to soak up the juice—just make sure you don’t press it deeper into the fabric. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Pre-treat the stain by soaking it in lemon juice.",
      "content": "Pre-treat the stain by soaking it in lemon juice. Slice open a lemon and squeeze the juice out over the stained fabric. Then, rub a lemon slice over the stain to saturate the fabric. Let it sit for 5 to 10 minutes so the acid in the lemon can loosen the stain. [2] X Research source If the garment is colored, keep it away from sunlight while the lemon juice is sitting to keep the fabric from lightening."
    },
    {
      "title": "Use cold water to flush the stain before the lemon juice dries.",
      "content": "Use cold water to flush the stain before the lemon juice dries. Turn the garment inside out and rinse from behind to further loosen the stain and push it out of the fabric. This will also keep the acid in the lemon juice from damaging the fibers in your garment. [3] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Rub the stained area with a mild laundry detergent.",
      "content": "Rub the stained area with a mild laundry detergent. Pour a small amount of detergent directly on the stain and gently rub it into the fabric with a clean cloth or your fingers. If you’re worried that direct contact with detergent will discolor your garment, test the detergent on a small, hidden spot first. [4] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Soak the stain in cold water for 15 to 30 minutes.",
      "content": "Soak the stain in cold water for 15 to 30 minutes. If the stain is still visible, scrub the spot with a soft brush and rinse with cold water. If the stain is no longer visible after this step, wash your garment according to the instructions and then air dry it. [5] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Spray the stain with an enzyme-based cleaner if the stain persists.",
      "content": "Spray the stain with an enzyme-based cleaner if the stain persists. Enzyme cleaners contain proteins that break down natural stains easily. Use a spray bottle to apply your enzyme cleaner to the stain. Let it sit for about 15 minutes. [6] X Research source For blueberry or other plant-based stains, enzyme cleaners with pectinase are the most effective."

    {
      "title": "Wash your garment with oxygenated bleach according to the tag instructions.",
      "content": "Wash your garment with oxygenated bleach according to the tag instructions. Run your garment in the washing machine with the recommended amount of oxygenated bleach (check the instructions on the bottle). Pour the bleach into the bleach dispenser rather than applying it directly to the stained fabric. [7] X Research source If you’re handwashing your stained clothes , use a solution of equal parts water and oxygenated bleach. Wash with warm water if your clothes are white, or cold water if they’re colored. Remember to always check the tag for washing instructions. Oxygenated bleach is safer for colors than traditional chlorine bleach. Look for products with “Oxy” in the name—they might be labeled as stain removers instead of bleach."

    {
      "title": "Let the garment air dry.",
      "content": "Let the garment air dry. The heat of the dryer can cause any remaining blueberry stain to set into the fabric, making it harder to remove later. Hang your garment someone away from direct sunlight and voilà! The stain is gone. [8] X Research source"
