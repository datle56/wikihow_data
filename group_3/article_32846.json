      "content": "Set clear dietary goals for yourself. It’s a great start that you’re determined to “eat healthy,” but you need to be more specific about what exactly you want to accomplish. After consulting with your doctor, write down a list of clear, achievable goals that you intend to meet. [2] X Research source You may want to start by writing down what you’d like to change about your current diet. You might write things like: “I need to eat more vegetables,” or, “I need to snack less.” Then, write down the dietary goals you intend to achieve. For example: “I will fill half my plate with vegetables at every meal,” or, “I will only snack on healthy foods that I’ve prepared myself.”"

It will probably be very difficult for you to completely change your entire diet all of a sudden, and you’ll end up more likely to fall back into your old eating patterns. If you need to make major dietary changes, start by setting 2 or 3 goals, then set 2 or 3 more once you’ve achieved the first batch.

This gives you clear evidence of your starting point, and it can be useful to bring it to your dietitian when establishing your new diet. You can keep an old-fashioned food diary, or use one of many smartphone apps. You may find the apps more convenient, and they also usually offer detailed nutritional information for the foods you’re eating."

Instead of trying to eliminate all unhealthy foods from your diet all at once, incrementally cut back and replace them with healthier options. Your end goal should be for at least 80% of your daily diet to be healthy foods, but it’s okay to indulge with that other 20%! Unhealthy foods to cut back on include: processed foods, packaged foods, and fast food; foods that are high in sugar, sodium, and/or saturated or trans fats; and alcohol, especially if you consume more than 1-2 drinks per day.

For the most part, you’ll want to avoid processed and packaged foods when planning your meals and buying your groceries. However, there are some ways to cut back on your prep time without sacrificing nutritional value. Fresh-frozen fruits and vegetables have the same nutrients as fresh ones, as do, for the most part, canned fruits and veggies.

Since you’ve planned your meals for the week ahead and have all the ingredients you’ll need, consider setting aside an afternoon to prep (and, in many cases, cook) all your meals for the week.

[15] X Research source Once you get the hand of batch cooking, you may want to start taking a whole day or weekend to prepare all your meals for the month ahead. You may need to invest in a larger freezer, though! Consider starting a batch-cooking club with friends or neighbors.
