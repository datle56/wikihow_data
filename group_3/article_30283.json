      "content": "Fold a square piece of paper diagonally in both directions. The creases should make an \"X\" in the paper. [1] X Research source Homayoon adds, “Make the folds in a way that they’re both valley folds” (a “down” fold where the edges of the paper come up to meet you). You can find a range of origami paper on Amazon . Feel free to add a design to the paper so it appears once it is folded."

      "content": "Bring the upper right corner in as shown. Then, repeat this on the other side. Press down firmly on the folds. [3] X Research source If making one squash fold is too difficult, Homayoon offers this alternative: “what I do is I take the top edge, I fold it down to the bottom edge, then I tuck the corners in. And what that does is it creates two flaps on the front and two flaps on the back.”"

      "content": "Fold the right and left corners into the center of the diamond. Then, repeat this on the other side. [4] X Research source As Homayoon puts it, “So at this point, you would take the diamond corners, which are on the left and right (there will be 4 of them) and fold them directly into the center. Flip the model over and do the same on the other side where you're folding the outside left and right diamond edges into the center.”"

      "title": "Tuck the loose flaps into the folds you just made.",
      "content": "Tuck the loose flaps into the folds you just made. Do this by folding a small triangle on each of the flaps and then tucking them into the folds. Repeat this for all four flaps. [5] X Research source If you have a hard time tucking the flaps into the folds, use tape to secure them to the folds. You can also use a pencil to open the folds easily and avoid damaging the flaps."

      "title": "Turn the folded paper to the end that does not have any flaps.",
      "content": "Turn the folded paper to the end that does not have any flaps. Locate the hole in the center of this side. [6] X Research source According to Homayoon, “At the point on the base of the triangle where we previously had the longest edge, there will be an opening.”"

      "title": "Blow into the hole.",
      "content": "Blow into the hole. The balloon should inflate—just remember to keep those flaps tucked in! [7] X Research source You might also need to loosen up the other folds a little bit for the balloon to become round. To help get the hole to open wider, Homayoon says “take 2 of [the edges] and hold them opposing each other. If you're having a little bit of difficulty you can pull on the edges a little bit.” Alternatively, turn your balloon into a watery weapon . Homayoon says “It’s called a water bomb. You can fill it up with water and make it like a little paper water bomb balloon.”"
