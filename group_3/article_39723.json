Factoring breaks down a large number into two or more smaller factors , for instance turning 9 into 3 x 3. Once we find these factors, we can rewrite the square root in simpler form, sometimes even turning it into a normal integer. For example, √9 = √(3x3) = 3. Follow the steps below to learn this process for more complicated square roots. [1] X Research source"

If neither of these gives you a whole number, move down this list, testing the other primes until you get a whole number result. You only need to test the prime numbers, since all other numbers have prime numbers as their factors. For example, you don't need to test 4, because any number divisible by 4 is also divisible by 2, which you already tried. [2] X Research source 2 3 5 7 11 13 17"

For example, if you're trying to simplify √98, follow the step above to discover that 98 ÷ 2 = 49, so 98 = 2 x 49. Rewrite the \"98\" in the original square root using this information: √98 = √(2 x 49). [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Repeat with one of the remaining numbers. Before we can simplify the square root, we keep factoring it until we've broken it down into two identical parts. This makes sense if you think about what a square root means: the term √(2 x 2) means \"the number you can multiply with itself to equal 2 x 2.\" Obviously, this number is 2! With this goal in mind, let's repeat the steps above for our example problem, √(2 x 49): 2 is already factored as low as it will go. (In other words, it's one of those prime numbers on the list above.) We'll ignore this for now and try to divide 49 instead. 49 can't be evenly divided by 2, or by 3, or by 5. You can test this yourself using a calculator or long division. Because these don't give us nice, whole number results, we'll ignore them and keep trying. 49 can be evenly divided by seven. 49 ÷ 7 = 7, so 49 = 7 x 7. Rewrite the problem: √(2 x 49) = √(2 x 7 x 7)."

Leave all other factors inside the square root. For example, √(2 x 7 x 7) = √(2)√(7 x 7) = √(2) x 7 = 7√(2). [4] X Research source Even if it's possible to keep factoring, you don't need to once you've found two identical factors. For example, √(16) = √(4 x 4) = 4. If we kept on factoring, we'd end up with the same answer but have to do more work: √(16) = √(4 x 4) = √(2 x 2 x 2 x 2) = √(2 x 2)√(2 x 2) = 2 x 2 = 4."

If you keep factoring until every term under the square root is a prime number (listed in one of the steps above), and no two are the same, then there's nothing you can do. You might have been given a trick question! For example, let's try to simplify √70: [5] X Research source 70 = 35 x 2, so √70 = √(35 x 2) 35 = 7 x 5, so √(35 x 2) = √(7 x 5 x 2) All three of these numbers are prime, so they cannot be factored further. They're all different, so there's no way to \"pull out\" an integer. √70 cannot be simplified."

If you notice a way to factor out a perfect square, it can save you time and effort. Here are some tips: [6] X Research source √50 = √(25 x 2) = 5√2. If the last two digits of a number end in 25, 50, or 75, you can always factor out 25. √1700 = √(100 x 17) = 10√17. If the last two digits end in 00, you can always factor out 100. √72 = √(9 x 8) = 3√8. Recognizing multiples of nine is often helpful. There's a trick to it: if all digits in a number add up to nine, then nine is always a factor. √12 = √(4 x 3) = 2√3. There's no special trick here, but it's usually easy to check whether a small number is divisible by 4. Keep this in mind when looking for factors."
