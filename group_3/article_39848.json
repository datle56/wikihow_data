In general, the first 36-48 hours of a gout attack are the most painful but you can relieve the initial pain and make sure you are doing all you can to end the gout attack as soon as possible. You can relieve some of the pain of gout by icing the joint. Use an ice pack wrapped in a towel and apply to the affected area for 20-30 minutes every hour that you are awake.

This will help to avoid the blood settling in the area that is being iced."

      "content": "Take over-the-counter pain relievers. Your can take common pain relievers, such as ibuprofen (eg. Advil, Motrin IB) and naproxen (eg. Aleve). Use any OTC NSAIDs for as short a time as possible. Long-term NSAID use can increase the chances of a heart attack or stroke and can also increase the risk of ulcers and bleeding. Make certain you follow manufacturer’s directions exactly. However, avoid any aspirin or topical aspirin products (eg. Aspercreme or any topical cream with salicylates). Aspirin products can cause more uric acid to deposit in the joints. Tylenol (acetaminophen) is not an anti-inflammatory medicine and is not likely to help. You could also take colchicine, but you may need a prescription from a doctor for that medication. For chronic control of gouty flares, you should take allopurinol, which decreases the amount of uric acid in the body.

      "content": "Make yourself as comfortable as possible. Gout often flares up at night, at that point, the weight of a blanket on a gouty toe, for example, can be extremely painful. If you know this is the case for you, and you have been having flare ups, then avoid that discomfort by turning up the heat in your bedroom and keep the blankets off your affected area. You may be more comfortable, at least the first night, sleeping in an armchair or a recliner where you can keep the joint elevated. If the gouty pain is in your toe, ankle, or knee, it may be best not to use a blanket or to tent the area over the joint if you can."

If you have been awakened at night by gout in the past, talk to your physician about possible treatments for a sleep condition. Make sure you avoid tobacco, in addition to avoiding any purine-rich food or beverage. Some purine-rich foods are red meats, anchovies, shellfish, fatty fish, asparagus, spinach, and most dry beans. [7] X Research source Avoiding these foods will help you sleep more soundly. Keep drinking plenty of water. While this won’t necessarily help you sleep in the immediate sense, but it will help flush out the uric acid that has built up. Drinking a cup of chamomile tea before bed can help you relax and get ready for sleep.

For example, if you are using topical pain relief, apply it about 20-30 minutes before you plan to sleep.

The medical treatment of gout uses medications that block the production of uric acid (eg. allopurinol (Aloprim, Lopurin, Zyloprim) and febuxostat (Uloric), ) or increase the excretion of uric acid (eg Probenecid (Probalan)) As you might suspect, these medication can cause significant side effects: Allopurinol can cause skin rashes, cause anemia, and can sometime increase joint pain. People of Asian and African heritage have a higher risk of skin rashes with allopurinol. Allopurinol is used to treat only chronic gout. It does not treat acute gout. If you are suffering from acute gout, you should take colchicine to relieve your symptoms, as allopurinol will not be very effective.

Steroidal anti-inflammatory agents and colchicine (Colcrys, Mitigare) can also be prescribed. Colchicine is an older drug that is less frequently used because of significant side effects."

Helpful supplements include: [17] X Trustworthy Source Arthritis Foundation Main organization devoted to arthritis support and education Go to source Omega-3 fatty acids, especially EPA. Bromelain is an enzyme derived from pineapples. It is often used to help treat digestive issues, but in gout, it is used as an anti-inflammatory agent. Folate, a B vitamin, inhibits the same enzyme (xanthine oxidase) that the anti-gout drug allopurinol inhibits, thus reducing uric acid levels. Quercetin is a bioflavonoid that also inhibits xanthine oxidase. Devil’s claw (Harpagophytum procumbens) has been traditionally used to treat gout by reducing uric acid levels. Anyone with gout should avoid supplemental Vitamin C or niacin. Both these vitamins may increase uric acid levels."
