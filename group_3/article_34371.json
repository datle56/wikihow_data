      "content": "Turn on the device you want to control. You will need to have the device on so that the remote can cycle through all of the available codes. This can take a while longer than direct code entry but is useful if you can't track down the list of codes. Although this isn't the fastest method, it's the easiest. Entering a direct code is much faster than letting your remote search for a code, but using Auto-Program means you don't have to find the code yourself."

      "content": "Press the Play button to cycle through codes. Every time the Play button is pressed, the next code in the entire code list is sent to the device. The indicator light on the remote will blink each time a code is sent. Continue pressing the button until the device turns off. When this happens, you have found the correct code. Cycling through the full code list can take a significant amount of time. Depending on the remote, you may have to go through several hundred codes. If you cycle through the entire list, the indicator light will blink four times and then turn off. In that case, your RCA Universal Remote has tried every code available and is not compatible with your device. To get around this, you can use a GE , Philips , or ONN Universal Remote."

Make sure that you are pointing the remote at the device the entire time. If the Power light is still illuminated when you entered the code, you've typed it in correctly. On the other hand, if the light blinks 4 times, the code you entered was incorrect, and you'll need to try again."

Sometimes different codes will give differing amounts of functionality."
