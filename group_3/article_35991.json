      "content": "Rub your eyes while they are closed. Rub your eyes very gently with your fingertips, as if almost tickling them.

      "content": "Try relaxation eye exercises. There are a number of exercises you can try to help your eyes relax. Not all of these work for everyone, but by trial and error you can see which ones work for you. [4] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Try blinking. Particularly when looking at a computer screen, which can be straining on the eyes, practice blinking every four seconds. See if this helps to relax your eyes. Roll your eyes. Close your eyes, and then roll your eyes in all directions. This can provide a very relaxing sensation, almost like a massage, and also can ease the tension in your eye muscles. Try \"visual scanning.\" Especially if you have been focusing on close-up objects like a computer screen for a long time, spend some time focusing on far away objects. Look to the corners of the room and take note of the visual detail of your surroundings (this is called \"scanning\")."

      "title": "Take a break.",
      "content": "Take a break. Especially if you do large amounts of computer work during your day, it can take a toll on your eyes. It is exhausting for your eyes to focus on the screen for long periods of time, but unfortunately, it can be hard to escape in today's day and age. Stand up and take a walk around during lunch break to give your eyes a chance to look around and focus on other things without having a screen right in front of them. This will make it much more manageable to get through your day with less strain on your eyes. Give your eyes a break by following the 20-20-20 rule. Every 20 minutes look at an object at least 20 feet away for 20 seconds."

Since the main culprit for eye strain is today's culture is time spent in front of a computer, a TV, a cell phone, or another device with a screen, finding alternatives such as reading a paper book rather than reading on your iPad can be a huge help. Also, to reduce the harmful effects of screen time that cannot be avoided (such as on your computer at work), try positioning the screen lower and using an anti-glare screen to diminish the strain on your eyes."

Cold water has a soothing effect that can help your eyes to relax. Another option is to apply cold cucumber slices over each eye, and to leave them on for 5-10 minutes. The coolness, as well as the chance to relax your eyes by keeping them shut, can make a noticeable difference. [5] X Research source"

It is possible that you have a vision problem, or another eye condition, that may be contributing to the discomfort and/or tension you feel. It is always better to be safe rather than sorry, and to see a doctor to ensure that nothing more serious is going on (as well as to obtain appropriate medical treatment if needed).
