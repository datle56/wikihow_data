      "content": "Handle the newborn pups minimally for the first 2 weeks. Weigh the puppies right after delivery and once a day for the first 2 weeks. Other than daily weigh-ins and whelping box maintenance , try to avoid disturbing the litter during these first 2 weeks. As long as they’re healthy and gaining weight, it’s best to interact with them as little as possible right after they’re born. [2] X Research source Puppies are fragile, so handling them excessively could pose an injury risk. Disturbing the litter unnecessarily could also stress out the mother. A healthy puppy’s weight should increase about 5 to 10% per day. Call the vet if a pup isn’t gaining weight, cries, or doesn’t huddle up with the rest of the litter. As for their first routine check-up, ask the vet if and when you should take the litter to the office. Puppies are prone to infections, so some vets advise keeping them at home for at least 2 to 4 weeks if there are no signs of trouble."

      "content": "Keep the whelping area calm to help prevent maternal aggression. While the puppies are newborns, only people the mother knows well should approach her and the litter. If you have other pets, keep them away from the whelping area, even if they’re well-behaved. Commotion and unfamiliar people and animals can stress out the mother and lead to aggression. [3] X Research source A whelping box is where the dam, or mother, gives birth and the pups spend the first few weeks of their lives."

      "title": "Manage protective aggression with the dam’s favorite treats.",
      "content": "Manage protective aggression with the dam’s favorite treats. If the mother gets aggressive when you try to handle the pups, soothe her in a gentle, encouraging voice. Offer her favorite treats to reward calm behavior and remind her you mean well. If she still won't calm down, have a helper leash her, lead her away for a potty break, and weigh and check the pups while she’s gone. [5] X Research source If she excessively growls, barks, tries to bite, refuses to leave the litter, or shows other signs of aggression and you can’t calm her, give her space. If the litter appears healthy, just try again after a few hours or the next day. You can observe the litter from a distance to determine the puppies are latching well and if they cry when they are separated from the litter. If a puppy is not latching well, then you may need to intervene. Dams sometimes aggressively protect their litter, but they usually become calmer after a few days. Keep in mind maternal aggression may mean the whelping area needs to be calmer and quieter."

      "title": "Lead the mother away from the litter for regular potty breaks.",
      "content": "Lead the mother away from the litter for regular potty breaks. Leash the dam and lead her away from the litter every 4 to 6 hours, or according to her normal potty schedule. If she’s hesitant, give a “Come” command and offer a high-value treat. [6] X Research source Most of the time, dams periodically leave the litter to stretch, eat, and go potty without hesitation. However, you might have to coax her away during the first few days after giving birth. When she potties, you may notice minor bleeding and a brown or greenish discharge, which are normal for the first week after giving birth. However, call the vet for excessive bleeding and discharge that persists, doesn’t become clearer over time, or smells foul. While the dam is away from the litter, you should also check the teats for redness, swelling, hardness, heat, or tenderness, which are signs of an infection."

      "content": "Set up a separate bed for the dam after 2 weeks. Place the mother’s bed next to the whelping box so she has a restful spot where she can keep an eye on the litter. Once the puppies are 2 to 3 weeks old, the mother will start to leave them more frequently and for gradually longer periods. [7] X Research source At 2 to 3 weeks old, the puppies will start to crawl, stand, walk, and explore their surroundings. The dam will still want to stay nearby at this stage, but she’ll start leaving them alone to encourage them to become independent."

      "content": "Move from dog milk formula to a blend of soft food and formula. Put milk replacement formula into a few dishes and give this to the puppies before offering them solid food. Once the puppies have the hang of lapping milk, you can mix a little wet food into the milk to make it the consistency of runny oatmeal or soup. Then, gradually thicken the consistency over time until the puppies are eating wet food. [8] X Research source You can also mix water or dog milk formula with dry food to soften it."

Next, mix in warm water until you’ve created a consistency like that of baby food or applesauce. Transfer the mixture to a food bowl, then place it in the whelping box.

      "title": "Offer gradually more solid food over the course of a month.",
      "content": "Offer gradually more solid food over the course of a month. By the time the litter is 5 to 6 weeks old, feed them blended formula and dry food 3 times per day. Each week, reduce the amount of milk and water you add so the mixture is gradually thicker and chunkier. By week 8, feed the puppies unmixed, unblended dry puppy food. [12] X Research source The right amount of food depends on the puppies’ breed, age, and adult weight, so check your product’s label for recommended serving sizes. Generally, smaller breeds need ½ to 1 cup (112 to 224 g) of food when they’re 2 to 3 months old. Larger breeds typically need around 1 to 2 cups (224 to 448 g)."

      "content": "Switch the mother to normal adult dog food gradually. While the puppies are nursing, feed the mother a high-calorie, high-protein commercial puppy food. When you begin the weaning process, replace about 10 to 20% of her daily portion of puppy food with normal adult dog food. Feed her gradually less high-calorie food until her meals consist entirely of normal food by week 8. [13] X Research source Feeding the dam puppy food helps maintain her nutrient levels while she produces milk. Abruptly switching her back to normal dog food could make her sick, so it’s important to make the transition gradual."

Touch each pup’s head, ears, belly, and paws to help it get accustomed to being handled. Other family members and friends should also begin handling the puppies, but you should only introduce 1 or 2 new people at a time. Avoid letting small children handle the pups, as they can be too rough. While dams may be protective soon after delivery, they usually allow other people and animals around the litter by 3 to 5 weeks.

      "content": "Introduce the puppies to well-behaved animals after they're vaccinated. Typically, puppies finish their first round of vaccinations when they’re around 6 weeks old. Once they’re vaccinated, see if any of your friends, relatives, or neighbors own well-trained dogs. Schedule play dates, and allow your puppies to meet and interact with new furry friends. When you introduce dogs, leash them and allow them to circle each other and sniff. To avoid territorial behavior, it’s best to introduce dogs on neutral turf. Additionally, introduce your puppies to your cat, if you have one, or a loved one’s cat that tolerates being around dogs. When introducing a cats and dogs, a dog should be leashed, and a cat should have an avenue to escape if it feels threatened. If the mother is present when you expose the litter to new animals, make sure she’s leashed, and offer high-value treats to remind her the situation is positive."
