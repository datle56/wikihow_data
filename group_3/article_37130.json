      "title": "Call animal control.",
      "content": "Call animal control. The easiest way to report excessive barking is to call your city’s animal control department. Give the person on the other end of the phone the location of the dog and tell them how long the dog has been barking. You can find the animal control phone number by looking in your phone book or searching the Internet for “your city” and “animal control.” In New York City, you can report excessive dog barking by calling 311. You can also report anonymously online. [1] X Research source Depending on your city, you might have to contact a different department. For example, in Los Angeles, you need to contact your local animal shelter. If you can’t find the phone number for animal control, then call the police. They should direct you to the right number."

      "title": "Meet with the investigating officer.",
      "content": "Meet with the investigating officer. Your city’s police or animal shelter will send someone out to investigate. Realize that this person might not come out right away. Instead, the person may come to check on the dog at another time. You should be available to talk to the person investigating the barking dog. Show the investigator where the dog is located and share any documentation, such as audio that you have recorded."

      "title": "Call animal control again if the dog continues barking.",
      "content": "Call animal control again if the dog continues barking. In many cities, the city will respond to your complaint by sending the dog’s owner a letter, explaining how they can reduce the dog’s barking. [2] X Research source If the dog continues barking, however, you need to report the barking once again to the appropriate authorities."

      "title": "Testify in court.",
      "content": "Testify in court. Depending on your city or county, you may have to testify in court against the dog owner. You will probably be nervous. However, you should remember these tips for being an effective witness: [3] X Research source Always tell the truth. It is illegal not to. Never guess if you don’t know the answer to a question. Also be careful when providing estimates. Be sure to preface an estimate with the words, “If I have to give an estimate, then I’d say….” Avoid humor. A court proceeding is serious business, and you should take it seriously. Don’t get angry. Always try to remain calm and in control."

      "title": "Identify if the barking is excessive.",
      "content": "Identify if the barking is excessive. Each city will have different rules about how much barking is “excessive.” Although you may find five minutes of barking late at night annoying, your city might not consider that amount of barking excessive. To find your city’s definition, search the Internet for “your city” and “excessive barking.” For example, in Los Angeles, barking is excessive if it is continuous for 10 minutes or intermittent for 30 minutes within a three hour window. In New York City, by contrast, barking warrants calling law enforcement if it lasts continuously for 10 minutes or more between the hours of 7:00 am and 10:00 pm or for five continuous minutes between 10:00 pm and 7:00 am."

    {
      "title": "Note the days and times of the barking.",
      "content": "Note the days and times of the barking. You should carefully document the days and times when the dog is barking. If the dog barks mostly at night, keep a log beside your bed so that you can easily write down the duration of the barking."

    {
      "title": "Record the dog barking.",
      "content": "Record the dog barking. You can build your case by tape recording the dog barking. In some cities, police or animal control officers won’t come right away to investigate. Instead, they might stop by the animal’s house several weeks later and listen for 10 minutes to check if they can hear barking. In these situations, it is highly unlikely that the dog will be barking at the precise moment the investigator shows up to listen. Accordingly, you should record audio of the dog barking so that you have proof. Use a digital recorder, tape recorder, or a camcorder. Your smart phone may be able to record video or audio."

    {
      "title": "Talk to the owner.",
      "content": "Talk to the owner. Experts disagree as to whether you should talk to the owner about the barking. In some situations, talking to the owner could be helpful. For example, the dog might bark only when the owner isn’t home, and the owner could be unaware of the barking. The owner could be grateful that you informed them of the problem. However, some owners might become hostile if you complain about the dog. Complaints about excessive barking can escalate into tit-for-tat “wars” between neighbors: you complain about the dog, your neighbor makes up a complaint about you, etc. If the dog owner becomes upset or annoyed when you talk, quickly end the conversation with a pleasant, “I just thought you should know” and don’t raise the issue again."
