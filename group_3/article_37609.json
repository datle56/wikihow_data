      "content": "Find a llama in savanna and windswept biomes. If you don’t have a llama already, head to your nearest savanna biome (including a savanna plateau or windswept savanna) and search for one. You can also track llamas in windswept gravelly hills biomes, along with windswept hills and forests. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Feed the llama 5 hay bales or 10 pieces of wheat to improve its temper (optional). Llamas are easier to tame when their temper levels are higher, which can be done by feeding it either 5 hay bales or 10 pieces of wheat (it will bleat at you when it’s no longer hungry). Each piece of wheat you give a llama improves its temper by 3, while each hay bale improves its temper by 6. [2] X Research source Note: You don’t technically have to this, but it can make the taming process a bit easier."

      "title": "Mount the llama several times until hearts appear.",
      "content": "Mount the llama several times until hearts appear. Use the “Mount” function in your game to hop on the llama’s back. The llama will likely buck you off its back at first, which is totally normal—just keep mounting it until hearts pop up on your screen. That means you’ve tamed it! Here are the “Mount” controls for different devices and consoles: PC and Mac: Right-click Xbox: LT PlayStation: L2 Pocket Edition: “Mount” button Nintendo Switch: ZL"

      "title": "Enjoy the ride as the llama moves you around.",
      "content": "Enjoy the ride as the llama moves you around. Since llamas can’t be equipped with saddles, it’s impossible to steer the llama and control the direction it goes in. In the meantime, either dismount the llama or enjoy whatever random journey it takes you on. When you’re ready to dismount: PC and Mac: Left ⇧ Shift Xbox: Press right stick PlayStation: Press right stick Pocket Edition: Hit the middle/crouch button 2 times Nintendo Switch: Press right stick"

      "title": "Obtain a lead in game.",
      "content": "Obtain a lead in game. You can craft one using 4 string and 1 slimeball, or you can sometimes find one in an Ancient City, Trail ruins, or a Woodland Mansion (or in Buried treasure, if you’re playing Bedrock Edition). Another quick (and more brutal) way to get leads is by killing the trader NPC (or otherwise separating them from their llamas)."

      "title": "Attach a lead to your llama to lead it around.",
      "content": "Attach a lead to your llama to lead it around. While holding a lead in your hand, secure it to the llama to create an active leash. Now, wherever you walk, the attached llama will automatically follow. [3] X Research source The in-game controls to attach a lead are: PC and Mac: Right-click Xbox: LT PlayStation: L2 Pocket Edition: “Leash” button Nintendo Switch: ZL Use the same control (or the “Unleash” option in Pocket Edition) to remove the lead from the llama."

      "title": "Put an empty chest on your tamed llama to give it saddlebags.",
      "content": "Put an empty chest on your tamed llama to give it saddlebags. Make a chest with 8 wooden planks and place it in your inventory. While approaching a tamed llama, hold the chest in your hand and use the in-game controls to place it on your llama’s back. Then, ride the llama and pull up your inventory to access the saddlebags. Transfer items from your inventory to your llama’s saddlebags to turn your llama into a walking storage unit! This can be helpful if you’re moving to a new location in-game. The number of inventory slots your llama has depends on its in-game strength stat. Some llamas might only manage 3 inventory slots, while others can manage up to 15 slots in their saddlebags.

      "content": "Put a section of carpet on your tamed llama to give it a colorful outfit. While riding your llama, pull up your in-game inventory—you’ll see a singular slot to the left of the llama’s icon. Place a piece of colored carpet there to automatically dress your llama in a fun outfit. [5] X Research source You can do this on a llama with or without saddlebags attached."
