      "content": "Use the Q, W, O, and P keys to control the runner’s legs. When you play QWOP , the controls only move the runner’s legs and not the rest of the body. [1] X Research source Q moves your right thigh forward and your left thigh backward. W moves your left thigh forward and your right thigh backward. O moves your left calf backward. P moves your right calf backward."

      "content": "Reach 100 meters in the game to cross the finish line. As you press the keys to control your runner, try to get as far down the track as you can. Each time you fall over, you’ll have to start from the beginning. Reach 100 meters to win the game! [2] X Research source At the 50-meter mark, there’s a hurdle that you must run through or jump over. When you reach 100 meters, there’s an optional long jump to see how far you’re able to reach. The game ends as soon as any part of your body touches the ground past the 100-meter mark."

      "title": "Tap O to lean forward at the start of your run.",
      "content": "Tap O to lean forward at the start of your run. Before you start moving your legs, press the O key quickly to shift the runner’s weight forward. That way, it’ll be easier to gain momentum without falling backward when you start swinging your legs. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Alternate pressing WO and QP to run down the track.",
      "content": "Alternate pressing WO and QP to run down the track. Start by pressing W and O at the same time to push off the ground with your right foot and start moving forward. [4] X Research source Just before the left foot hits the ground, release the keys, and press Q and P to push your left foot down. [5] X Research source Keep a slow and steady rhythm while you get the hang of running because it’s easy to lose your balance. As you get used to running at a slow speed, try pressing the keys and letting them go quickly to move faster. If the front foot ever lands behind the runner’s torso, wait a little longer to press the keys down."

    {
      "title": "Stand up if you fall into splits.",
      "content": "Stand up if you fall into splits. Falling to splits is a common occurrence, but recovering is easy if you carefully press the right buttons. How to stand back up depends on your leading foot. [6] X Research source If your right foot is out in front, tap P until your front calf is vertical. Then, tap W to bring your thigh under your torso. Press P until your back foot lifts up and quickly press WO. If your left foot is out in front, tap O until your front calf is vertical. Then, tap Q to bring your thigh under your torso. Press O until your back foot lifts up and quickly press QP."

    {
      "title": "Press Q and W repeatedly to slowly scoot down the track.",
      "content": "Press Q and W repeatedly to slowly scoot down the track. If you’re having trouble running but still want to beat QWOP, press and hold W to drop down to the splits. Alternate between tapping Q and W to stay on your knees and move your body forward a few tenths of a meter at a time. [7] X Research source Avoid holding Q down because you may lean backward and fall down. You may need to tap W a few times to fully extend your front leg and scoot forward. Once you reach the hurdle, just stay in the same position and push through it. It may just slow down your progress a little bit more."
