Instead, the only requirement is to reach level 500 in Fisch—but make no mistake, it’ll take time to accomplish. Once you hit level 500, text will appear that says, “An evil presence unlike any other lurks within you…,” signaling that you’ve unlocked the No-Life Rod. [1] X Research source Below, we’ve included some tips to help you get to level 500 as fast as possible. Still, be prepared to do quite a bit of XP farming!"

      "content": "Use other fishing rods and their buffs to farm XP faster. While there’s no definitive path to reaching level 500, specific rods can speed up the process. One of the best rods for this is the Rod of the Depths ; its passive guarantees an extra fish for every three catches. However, it’s also an end-game rod, unlocked by finishing the Vertigo Bestiary. Based on your level, you might have better access to these other rods: [2] X Research source Carbon Rod - This is typically considered the best early-game rod, with decent buffs for low-level players. Buy it in Moosewood for 2,000 C$. Nocturnal Rod - An early to mid-game rod with the passive ability to catch nocturnal fish at any time of the day. Buy it from Synth’s shop for 11,000 C$. Steady Rod - A reliable and resilient mid-game rod capable of catching enormous Legendary and Mythical fish. Buy it in Roslit Bay for 7,000 C$. Aurora Rod - Another effective mid-game rod with high luck and good passives. Buy it for 70,000 C$ near Synth’s store during Aurora Borealis events. Mythical Rod - A mid-game rod with a handy passive; it has a 30% chance of applying the Mythical mutation to anything caught. Buy it from the Travelling Merchant for 90,000 C$. Heaven’s Rod - One of the best late-game rods with high Control and Luck stats, as well as a chance of catching fish with the Heavenly mutation. Complete the Glacial Grotto puzzle and buy this rod for 2,750,000 C$. Wisdom Rod - A mid and late-game rod that gives a 5% XP bonus for every perfect catch streak. Craft the rod at the Ancient Archives crafting station."

      "content": "Choose enchantments and bait that’ll increase your XP gains. Enchantments add extra buffs and abilities to rods that make them even more effective, and several can help you level up faster. The best enchantments are Insight and Clever ; Insight grants x1.5 XP to all catches, and Clever (a step up) grants x2.25 XP to all catches. It’s also a good idea to use Rapid Catcher, Seaweed, or Deep Coral bait when fishing. [3] X Research source Hasty can also be a helpful enchantment. It increases your Lure Speed by 55%. It can improve rods like Steady or allow instant catches with Heaven’s Rod . Abyssal is an enchant that increases the chance of catching Abyssal fish by 10%. It works well when paired with the Rod of the Depths . Clever and Insight will be helpful no matter which rod they’re paired with—although we recommend the Rod of the Depths if possible since it’s one of the best rods for fast leveling. Rapid Catcher bait increases lure speed by 35. Seaweed increases resilience by 10, lure speed by 20, and preferred luck by 35. Deep Coral increases resilience by 50."

The Ancient Isles is a fantastic spot for fishing since you can catch rare and Legendary fish, granting as much as 9,000 XP per catch. Try fishing around the western waterfall and the beach at the Ancient Isles. You can also fish at the Atlantean Storm , which is located right next to the Grand Reef and offers the most Legendary and Mythical fish of any fishing spot. [4] X Research source Another location to try is the freshwater pond at the Forsaken Shores . You’ll find it in front of the waterfall, and you can catch fish like the Captain’s Goldfish there. Finally, the Cryogenic Canal (located on the Northern Expedition island) is also a good place to catch Mythical and Legendary fish, like the Glacial Sturgeon or Aurora Trout."

Completing each quest grants a reward (including XP and C$), and the more quests you do, the better the rewards will get. So, make sure to check in with the Angler often for a new quest! [5] X Research source You can also buy the Double XP game pass from the Fisch store (if possible). It costs 199 Robux and doubles the amount of XP you earn in-game, which can absolutely help you level up faster."

In fact, its Control stat is the best in the game! The No-Life Rod also has two powerful passive abilities to take advantage of. Its stats are as follows: [6] X Research source Lure Speed: 90% Luck: 105% Control: .23 Resilience: 10% Max Kg: Infinite Hexed (Passive): With this passive, there’s a 50% chance for the Hexed mutation to be applied to any fish or items caught. Stab (Passive): With this passive, there’s a chance to stab fish (like the Trident Rod, but with a bit less stun). It’s also similar to the Piercing enchantment. Rod Description: “Fisching 24.7.365. Are you okay?”"

      "title": "Enchantments",
      "content": "Enchantments The rod already has a built-in money-making perk (the Hexed enchantment). So, it’s best to use enchantments that boost the No-Life Rod’s already impressive stats, like Luck and Resilience, or increase the amount of XP you can get with the rod (if you want to keep leveling up fast). For example: [7] X Research source Lucky, Divine, or Immortal - These enchantments all improve the Luck stat. Lucky adds +20% Luck, Divine gives +45% Luck, and Immortal grants +75% Luck. Quality - This enchantment offers the best overall stat boost without bait, with a +15% Lure, +15% Luck, and +5% Resilience. Steady - Pair Steady with good bait for a +20% boost to progress speed when you reel in fish. Insight or Clever - As mentioned above, use Insight or Clever for an XP boost (x1.5 or x2.25, respectively). Hasty - Finally, use Hasty with Weird Algae bait for instant catches and the highest possible Luck boost—200% Universal Luck."

They’re relatively easy to get by opening up Bait Crates, and they both enable instant catches while fishing. Combined with the rod’s Hexed ability, which makes fish worth 50% more money, you can do a ton of fishing (and get tons of profit) with either type of bait. [8] X Research source"
