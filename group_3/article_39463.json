      "content": "Do little favors for him. One way to show your husband that you love him is to do little favors that let him see how much you care for him. If he’s having a busy week at work or just a rough day, then making the effort to help him out during his daily life can really show him that you love him and that you care about him. While you don’t need to get into the habit of doing everything for him, just doing the right favor at the right time can really show him how much you care. Here are some ideas: Bring him lunch to work if he forgot it. Pick up fresh coffee and a pastry for him in the morning if he has a big day at work. Pick up that book he’s been meaning to read at the store. Help him with a simple chore, like doing laundry or walking the dog, when he’s having a crazy week. Make that call to the maintenance man that he’s been putting off all week."

[1] X Trustworthy Source American Psychological Association Leading scientific and professional organization of licensed psychologists Go to source Make an effort to block off time on your calendar just for the two of you to reconnect and to be together. Though you may think you’re too busy for a traditional date night, this is an important way to show your husband you love him. Date night doesn’t have to mean a romantic meal and a movie, either. Think about the kind of date night that may appeal most to your husband. Maybe you can mix things up and check out the new brewery in town or go to a ball game, for a change. If you plan at least a few date nights per month on your calendar in advance, then this will show that you love him and want to make the effort. Look nice on your date night and show him that you really care. Take time with your hair, clothes, and jewelry so he sees that you treat it as a special occasion."

      "content": "Have him lay down and really get the kinks out of his back. This can be a great way to show your love just because, or an amazing way to transition into some foreplay. If you do this when he least expects it, it may get the best results. If he’s just sitting at his desk, looking over some paperwork, or reading a magazine on the couch, give him a sneak massage attack. Just be gentle, especially with his feet, if you haven’t done this before. He may be more ticklish than you expected."

If you really want to show your husband that you love him, then you have to make him see that you’re determined to have a positive relationship with his family, even if you don’t always get along. Even if his mother is about as welcoming as an angry poodle, you have to do your best to try to at least be cordial with his family and avoid bad-mouthing them as much as you can so he sees that his love is more important to you than the fact that you have nothing in common with his sister. Of course, sometimes, it can feel nearly impossible to get along with your in-laws. But if you at least make an effort, then your husband will see that he really does mean a lot to you. Try reaching out to his family more, whether you call them, invite them to lunch, or send flowers on birthdays and important occasions."

This can mean trying to go scuba-diving, taking a biking trip along the California coast, or even taking a salsa class. It’s not really important what you do, as long as you make an effort to keep things feeling new and exciting. [2] X Expert Source Allen Wagner, MFT, MA Marriage & Family Therapist Expert Interview. 6 March 2019. The fact that you’re not resigned to doing the same old thing day after day will show your husband how much you love him. Make sure to stick to some of your favorite traditions. If you want to show your husband that you really love him, then continue going to your favorite restaurant once a month, watching your favorite show together, and even seeing your old favorite band, even if you both agree it’s not as good as it used to be, if you think you can still make a fun night of it. You don’t need to try too hard to try a million new things at once, or that will get overwhelming. Make an effort to do one or two completely new things together a month, whether you’re hiking or making pasta from scratch, and take it from there."

Though making love isn’t the only way you can show how much you care, making an effort to have a passionate, exciting time in the bedroom can make your husband see that you really do care for him. [3] X Research source Make sure you’re in the mood and that you’re not just doing it to cross an item off your checklist, and take the time to explore your husband’s body in a sensual and exciting way. It’s never too late to try a new position or to make love in a new place. As long as you’re comfortable with it, this can be a great way to show him how much you care. If you don’t feel corny about it, wearing some sexy lingerie never hurt anyone. You can even invest in some massage oils or body lotion that can make things feel more sensual. Ask your husband what he really wants from you, and encourage him not to hold back. As long as you’re comfortable with it, this can help show him how much you love him—just make sure you’re getting something in return."

You may think that the only way you can show your husband how much you love him is by getting closer to him, but sometimes, the best way to show how much you care is to give him the space he needs and deserves. [4] X Research source Let him have a night out with his buddies, encourage him to go camping with his brother, and don’t get annoyed when he’d rather spend the evening reading or working out than having dinner with you. Though he should still make time for you, you don’t want to smother him, or he actually will end up feeling more suffocated than loved. Letting your husband have his own life and spend time with his own friends is perfectly healthy. In fact, spending more time apart will make you appreciate each other more when you’re together. Don’t be jealous. If you have no reason to be jealous, then give your husband the respect he deserves by not calling him every two seconds when he’s out with his friends or giving him the stink eye any time he talks to another woman."

If he’s been trying to get you to go to a Knicks game for years, get him tickets to one on his birthday. If he’s been wanting you to try brewing your own beer with him, spend a Sunday having fun in the kitchen with him instead of rolling your eyes. Though you don’t have to be one of those couples who does everything together, if you want to show him you love him, then you should make an effort to appreciate the things he loves, at least once in a while. Your relationship can grow stronger if you introduce him to more of the things you love, too. Though you shouldn’t force him to go to yoga with you, you may be able to find something that he would actually like, like the new Thai place you’ve been hitting up with your friends."

Let him see that you think he’s an amazing man with endless potential; sometimes, your words can make him feel better about himself than anything else. Simply saying something like, “You’re so good with people. I’m sure you have nothing to be nervous about. I think you’ll love working on this new project,” can make him feel more confident in his actions. You can also say, “You’re so determined that I have no doubt you’ll be able to run this marathon.

Make an effort to tell your husband you love him at least once a day and to look him in the eyes when you say it so he knows you mean it. Make eye contact and stop everything to get this message across instead of saying “Love ya!” like you’re just required to say it. Put your heart into him and let him know how loved he truly is. Though telling him you love him in person is most effective, saying these words over the phone or over email can also make him feel more loved. Don’t just say “I love you” when you’re on a date or going through a hard time. Sometimes, saying it just because will yield the best results."

I don’t know how you do it.” “You always know what to say to make me feel better. You have a talent for it.” “I’m so thankful to be with someone who is always reading so much.

Though you don’t need to interrogate him or ask about every little thing, taking the time to see how his day went will show that you really love him. If you know that he had an important day, such as a big presentation at work or a tense reunion with a friend he hadn’t seen in a long time, make sure you follow up about him so he knows you care. When you ask how his day went, don’t just ask in passing, but stop what you’re doing to make him see that it really matters to you."

Making an effort to really talk to him instead of being passive aggressive or short with him will really show him how much you love him. Listening is a big part of communicating. Just hearing what he has to say without interrupting him or disagreeing with him can make a huge impact on your relationship. Be as honest as you can. Though the occasional white lie won’t hurt him, make sure you don’t keep secrets from him or make him feel like he’s shut out from your life.

      "content": "Compromise. Another way to show your husband that you really love him is to be able to compromise about the things that matter to you both. Find a way to sometimes get what you want, sometimes give him what he wants, and to compromise on situations where there’s something possible for both of you. Compromising is an important part of showing your love because this will make your husband see that you really do care whether or not he’s fulfilled and happy. [10] X Research source Strong communication is important because it will let you see what things really matter to your husband, and what he is willing to let go. Work on striking a balance. You can pick the movie for date night, and he can pick the dinner spot. Be willing to see that being happy is often more important than being right and that it’s not important for you to get your way every single time. When you give him what he wants, don’t resent him for it the whole time. For example, if you agree to go to his brother’s barbecue instead of your friend’s birthday party, don’t sulk the whole time you’re there, or he’ll see that you’re not really willing to compromise after all."

He’ll see how much you love him because he’ll be impressed that you’re able to humble yourself and fess up. Just remember that while saying you’re sorry is important, it can be even more important to stick to your word. If you apologize for being snappy with his friends, you should really make an effort not to do it again."

Make sure he’s not busy and in the mood to enjoy your delicious treats, and you’ll be showing him how much you love him. If you have kids, they can help you serve him. Heart shaped pancakes with some halved strawberries can be a cute way to show him how much he means to you. If he’s more into bacon and eggs, you can make him a smiley face out of egg eyes and a bacon mouth, and have him laughing over how hard you tried. If you really want to hammer home the point that you’re being romantic , then make some chocolate-covered strawberries and serve them as a side dish or place them over his Belgian waffle.

Though you don’t have to spend a lot of money or go very far, just taking a weekend trip to go hiking, check out wine country, or spend some time relaxing on the beach can help you show your husband how much you love him in a new context. Though you can’t always get away, this can be a great change of pace and can let him see how much he really means to you. If you’re stumped about where to go, try to think of something that would appeal more to him than to what your idea of a romantic getaway will be. Sure, you may think hiking is romantic, but if he’s more into city life, then you should plan an urban adventure instead."

Just set the tent up in the backyard together, roast some hot dogs over the campfire, and have S’mores for dessert and you’ll be on the way to getting your groove back. Your husband may be reluctant, at first, but you can convince him that this can be an easy and fun way to have an adventure together.
