      "content": "Use a beard trimmer to reduce the amount of hair you need to shave. If you have a full beard, it will be difficult to shave it all off using only a razor. Trimming as much of your beard down to stubble as you can with your beard trimmer will make it easier to shave it off with a razor later. You can purchase a beard trimmer at most major retailers and large pharmacies. If you don’t have a specialty beard trimmer or a set of clippers, have your barber trim your beard for you. If you have over 4 week’s growth, trim your beard to stubble and then wait a week before shaving the stubble. This gradual approach will help reduce the risk of ingrown hairs and skin irritation.

      "content": "Exfoliate your face with a facial scrub to remove dead skin, oil, and dirt. Exfoliating your skin before shaving will also help lift your hairs, allowing for a closer shave. You can use either a facial scrub or wash. [2] X Research source Since you haven’t shaved for a while, your skin will be sensitive. For this reason, don’t scrub too hard when exfoliating your skin. You may also want to use a shaving cream for dry and sensitive skin."

      "title": "Wash your face with warm or hot water before starting to shave.",
      "content": "Wash your face with warm or hot water before starting to shave. Shaving after washing your face with warm water will soften your beard and open your pores. This will help prevent your skin from becoming irritated and will reduce the risk of nicks and cuts. The best time to shave your stubble is during or right after a warm shower. Draping a warm, wet towel over your face is another way to open your pores. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Lather your face with shaving gel or foam to improve razor glide. For best results, use a brush to apply the shaving cream to your face. A brush will help you apply the shaving cream evenly, which may help prevent ingrown hairs. [4] X Research source For a smoother shave, add some water to your shaving cream before applying it to your face. Let the shaving cream sit on your face for 2 – 3 minutes before starting to shave, so that the cream can fully moisten your facial hair.

      "content": "Check that your razor is sharp to reduce skin irritation. If you haven’t shaved your beard for a while, your skin may be quite sensitive and easily irritated. Using a dull razor may make your skin even more irritated. Keep your razor stored in a dry place to help prevent bacteria from growing on the blades. If the lubricator strip on your razor cartridge looks worn, switch to a new cartridge.

If you missed any spots, re-lather your face with shaving gel or cream and shave those areas. Try not to go over any area more than once to avoid irritating your skin."

Rubbing your recently shaved face can irritate your skin and lead to redness. Check your face and neck in the mirror to make sure you’ve rinsed off all the shaving cream. Don’t forget to wipe behind your ears. Shaving cream can sometimes end up in this easy-to-miss location."

When applying lotion after a shave, lightly pat the lotion on your face while it’s still wet. Try to avoid rubbing the lotion onto your face, as this can irritate your skin. [11] X Research source Using a moisturizer with SPF will also help protect your skin from the sun. Try to avoid using perfumed or alcohol-based aftershaves. These can dry out or irritate rather than soothe your skin. [12] X Research source"
