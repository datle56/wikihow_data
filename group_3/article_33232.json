      "title": "Do the Choice of Fate!",
      "content": "Do the Choice of Fate! When you begin the game, you will choose between 10 heroes with two synergies revealed on each (all heroes are an Elite level). Once the duration is finished, you will get 3 random heroes of your specific choice (including the hero selected)."
    },
    {
      "title": "Prepare your lineup.",
      "content": "Prepare your lineup. You should get a lineup that you'll want for a specific round. Try getting a hero that you need in your lineup, or upgrade your heroes to the next level. You should also adjust based on what your opponents have in their lineup. You can maybe see a random hero that could get a 3 star, or they can take someone you had planned to do. Note the hero pool. You are not guaranteed to get the hero you want, but every quality of a hero will reduce the amount needed. Legendary Heroes (marked in yellow text for heroes) only have 9, but Normal Heroes (marked with gray text) have 27 heroes each. This should be an important factor, especially if you are trying to get 3-star heroes outside of the Normal level."
    },
    {
      "title": "Have some Synergies.",
      "content": "Have some Synergies. Synergies are important in battle since it's the only way to increase your hero power without getting everyone on 2-star heroes. Try activating the Wrestler or the Assassin roles quickly to counter everyone in the battle! If you want, you can check the opponents to see what synergy they are activating. It's best to use Mystic Bureau when most opponents use the Wrestler synergy. After the beginning of the last Planning stage, you will be given three random synergies as a Magic Crystal, with one guaranteed to be from one of the synergies you are working on. Choose one of them to allow them to have that synergy. During the creep rounds in Placement/Showdown, you can enhance the Magic Crystal by selecting runes/effects that could affect the Magic Crystal user or benefit you entirely. It is also possible to gain a “blessing” when upgrading heroes. This will lower the synergy requirement for the synergy that is buffed!"
    },
    {
      "title": "Attack!",
      "content": "Attack! These rounds are made to fight with different lineups, so battle hard into your lineup. If it's the creep round, don't remove everyone, since you can lose HP!"
    },
    {
      "title": "Get an interest.",
      "content": "Get an interest. When you are saving gold on Magic Chess, you will get an amount of interest in coins. This will give you an extra 1 coin per saved. Saving 20+ gold will give 4 more coins. You should save as much as possible in the early game to convert it into battle power."
    },
    {
      "title": "Grab gold.",
      "content": "Grab gold. Gold can be earned in multiple ways, including selling heroes at the end of each battle. Earning gold will be needed to get your heroes on time."
    },
    {
      "title": "Do the Box of Fate.",
      "content": "Do the Box of Fate. The Box of Fate can carry helpful heroes/equipment that can change the tides of battle. This decision can be an amazing factor soon! You should choose the equipment first since there can be Synergy equipment (if you need to complete Weapon Master/Astro Power), or a Science Crystal (important since it increases capacity without wasting coins). If needed, you can choose the heroes in the pool."

      "title": "Make use of your Little Commander's skills.",
      "content": "Make use of your Little Commander's skills. Some skills can be key to saving your game (AKA Connie's I Want All of Them and Pao's Dragon's Gift). Using them requires timing and the situation."
