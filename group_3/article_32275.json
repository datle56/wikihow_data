This way, the paint won’t seal the pieces together when it dries. If your table has no leaf, there’s no need to take pieces apart. [2] X Research source"

Use an orbital sander with some medium-grit sandpaper to sand the top of the table smooth. [4] X Research source Go slowly and be careful not to gouge the surface. Don’t worry about removing all of the varnish, but sand down enough that the table isn’t too glossy and the primer will stick. [5] X Research source If your table is unvarnished, use 150-grit sandpaper to sand the table’s surface smooth. Always remember to wear protective gear when sanding. Before you begin, put on gloves, eye protection, and a mask."

      "content": "Prime the table with roll-on/brush-on primer. Roll-on/brush-on formulas are best for high-traffic surfaces like tables, since they tend to be thicker and more durable than spray-on formulas. Apply 1 coat of primer with a mini foam roller or medium to small brush. Let that layer dry before applying a second coat and letting it dry as well. [8] X Research source Primer helps the paint stick to the wood and covers up any stains and discoloration. [9] X Research source Make sure to roll or brush the primer in the direction of the wood grain. [10] X Research source In between coats, wrap your roller or brush in a plastic bag and place it in the fridge. This will keep the paint moist and save you cleaning time in between layers.

      "content": "Select either an enamel-, latex-, or oil-based paint. All 3 look beautiful and are easily washable. However, they vary when it comes to durability and user-friendliness. Enamel-based paints are known for being hard, durable, rust-resistant, and easily washable. Latex-based paints are also easy to clean and look beautiful, but they don’t cure as well and are nowhere near as durable. Oil-based paints have a strong, unpleasant smell and must be cleaned up with special solvents, but they sink into the wood as they cure, making them extremely durable and easily washable."

Semi-gloss is best for kitchen tables because it’s tough, easy to clean, and hides fingerprints and smudges better than a flat-finish paint. If you choose a glossy finish, go for a semi-gloss indoor latex paint or a water-based enamel paint. [15] X Research source"

      "content": "Choose a flat finish paint to cover up imperfections. Flat finishes work well for console tables or coffee tables because a smooth, matte finish hides any imperfections in the table’s textures. However, it is difficult to clean without damaging the paint job, so make sure not to use it on high-traffic surfaces. [16] X Research source If you’re not sure if you want flat or semi-gloss finish, start with a flat-finish paint. If you later decide that you prefer gloss, you can cover the flat paint with a satin or semi-gloss finish. [17] X Research source"

Next, use a 4 in (10 cm) foam roller to apply a thin layer of paint to the table's flat surfaces. The foam roller will create a smooth, even finish without any brushstrokes. Be careful to avoid drips around the table’s edges and try to make the transition between brush and roller as level and smooth as possible. Use a synthetic bristle brush with a latex-based paint, and a natural bristle brush for oil-based paint. Always paint in the direction of the natural wood grain."

With some fine-grit sandpaper, gently sand down any drips and imperfection to even out the paint’s level. The orbital can be too strong for the primer and paint, so sand by hand to smooth and protect each layer. Generally, 2-3 layers should be enough for lighter paints. Darker colors may need additional coats to get an even finish. [18] X Research source Check for drips in areas where you switched between brush and roller."

This is especially important with oil- and enamel-based paints. If you don’t let the table cure long enough, it will be more prone to chipping and peeling.

To apply it, dip a clean cotton cloth into some clear paste wax and apply it evenly over the table’s surface. Let it dry for at least an hour, then buff away the excess with a clean cloth or electric polisher. Repeat the process 3-4 times until you’ve built up a tough exterior. [23] X Research source"

To apply either finish, lightly sand the tabletop with 320-grit sandpaper and wipe away any dust. Use a foam roller to apply a thin layer of protectant. Let it dry for 2 hours. Repeat this process 3-4 times. [24] X Research source Because these finishes tends to yellow over time, avoid using them over white or very light colors.
