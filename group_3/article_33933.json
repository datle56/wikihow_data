      "content": "Decide what type of tofu to buy. When purchasing tofu, you may notice it labeled as soft, firm, extra-firm, etc. While all delicious, each of these have a different texture. Which one you choose depends on what you plan on doing with it. For example: [1] X Research source Silken tofu is soft and creamy. You can use it as-is in creamy dishes, such as smoothies, pudding, sauces, and dips. You can also chop it up and add it raw to soups or salads or make smooth dishes like dango. Soft tofu is delicate and feels like Jello or gelatin. Like silken tofu, soft tofu is ideal of sauces, smoothies, and pudding. Medium-firm tofu is some-what soft. It crumbles easily, and is ideal for mixing with vegetables or making stuffed dishes. Firm tofu is quite popular. It's great for stir-fry, tofu scramble, and curry. Extra-firm tofu can hold up to lots of handling, making it ideal for baking and frying."

      "content": "Marinate or season the tofu, if desired. Skip the oil-based marinades, unless otherwise directed in the recipe. Instead, go for marinades that are based on citrus, soy, or vinegar. [7] X Research source Keep in mind that your recipe may ask you to hold off on the seasoning until after cooking. Marinated tofu already comes flavored, and does not require further flavoring. Toss the tofu in cornstarch if you want to give it a crispy crust while baking or frying. Dust off any excess cornstarch. [8] X Research source Avoid using sauces that contain lots of sugar as they may overpower the other flavors in the sauce and dish."
