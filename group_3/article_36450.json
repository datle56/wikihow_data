      "content": "Soak any wet wine up with a cloth and sprinkle baking soda over the spill. Use enough baking soda to completely cover up the wine. Wait 3 minutes, pour some cold water on the baking soda, and use a damp cloth to blot the area repeatedly until the wine is gone. [1] X Research source When you’re soaking the wine up, gently blot the area with your cloth instead of wiping the stain up. Dragging the cloth against the carpet may accidentally spread the wine out, while blotting will help soak it up. You may need to do this several times to get the vast majority of the wine stain out."

      "content": "Yes, but you need to test it in an inconspicuous area first. On some carpets, hydrogen peroxide will cause permanent discoloration. Pour a very tiny drop in an inconspicuous area and wait a few minutes. If the carpet seems fine, pour the hydrogen peroxide over the stain. Then, sprinkle baking soda over the top of the carpet. Wait at least 3 minutes and pour water over the area. Soak up your peroxide and baking soda with a damp towel to remove the stain.
