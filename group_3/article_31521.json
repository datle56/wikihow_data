One study indicated 26% of people polled met a partner while they were working out, and 73% said exercising together strengthens a relationship. [4] X Research source Put these stats to the test by becoming a regular at your local gym and casually striking up conversation with an attractive older woman. Here are a few things you can say to break the ice (in a not-weird way): “I’ve never used this machine before. Do you know how to do it?” “I think we’re in the same spin class together—how do you like it? My legs are still dead from this morning’s workout!” Pro tip: If you want to catch a woman’s eye, take a swimming lesson or two. Studies show women are extra impressed by men who swim.

For instance, it’s estimated that most yoga students are middle-aged women, so a yoga studio could be a great place to get to know older women. [6] X Research source You could also try cooking classes, pottery classes, or dance classes. Of course, don’t be “that guy” who takes a class just to flirt with women, especially if you aren’t actually interested in yoga. Be graceful if the women you chat up aren’t interested in talking to you, and don’t take it personally—they’re there for yoga!"

One study showed public book clubs were made up of roughly 50% women and 50% men (but when it comes to private book clubs, members are overwhelmingly women). [7] X Research source Another study suggests people in their 30s and 40s specifically represent a large chunk of book club attendees.

Next time you’re stocking up on essentials at Giant Eagle, ask the cutie next to you which flavor of carbonated water she recommends. Or next time you’re shopping for a new wardrobe at Target, ask the hottie near you if the jacket you’re trying on looks all right. It’ll get a conversation going…and maybe you’ll exchange numbers."

[12] X Research source If it doesn’t, no biggie! There are loads of other wonderful women out there. You may be able to get an idea of whether she’s returning the vibes by her body language: if she faces you with her arms loose and open and her feet pointed at you, that’s a good sign! Exposing her wrists or neck is also an indication she’s into you. [13] X Research source You might notice a lot of our tips for flirting with an older woman are the same tips you’d use to flirt with a young woman. Well, that’s because older women are women, folks, and you flirt with them in basically the same way, regardless of their age."

If she seems to be returning your flirtatious energy, say, “Hey, I’ve enjoyed talking to you, and I’d love to get your number.” It’s still possible she’ll say no at this point, and that’s fine—but if she’s been flirty so far, it’s likely she’ll be happy to trade phone numbers. You might even be more direct about your intentions and say, “I’d love your number so I can call/text you later to make plans. Is that OK?” or “I’d really love to go out sometime. May I have your number?” The one way in which flirting with an older woman is different from flirting with a younger woman is she might not realize you’re flirting at first, especially if you’re significantly younger. But asking for her number—especially if you say you want to take her out—is a pretty big sign you’re into her, so there’s really no mistaking your intentions here!"

Seriously, though, she might be into a nude—but wait until you’ve been flirting for a while and preface it with something like, “I’d love to send you a more explicit photo of me… 😏” Don’t pressure her if she says no: she may not be interested in taking things further—or she may just need more time!

Behr stresses that it’s important to “[consider]...how someone with a significant age gap can fit into your life as it is currently,” including “your current social circles [and] your family and your friendships.” Is it important to you that your partner be able to fit in with your friend group? If yes, how will they fit in? There’s no reason an age gap relationship can’t work out, but the fact remains that people of significantly different ages tend to have significantly different social circles and may enjoy doing very different things in their spare time. If this proves to be an issue for you and/or your partner, your relationship may not work out, unfortunately."

How do we feel about those dynamics?” Not every older woman will already have a family, but many will. If she does, how do you fit in? Is this a dynamic you’re comfortable with? If the idea of partnering with someone with a family feels overwhelming, keep in mind it might not end up being as big a deal as it seems at first. That said, it’s important to be honest with yourself about your expectations for the relationship and how you want your dynamic to look."

Will it bother you if your partner is significantly more financially well-off than you? This can be a sore spot for some guys in particular! On the other hand, she’s likely to have had a lot more financial and professional experience than you, and may be able to offer advice and help you advance."

When it comes to our sex lives, there’s really no “normal.” But we can tell you it is very common to be attracted to older women . Studies suggest 60% of men are attracted to women who are significantly older than they are. [16] X Research source And, 90% of men would be open to dating an older woman. [17] X Research source Relationships with large age gaps are socially taboo, but there’s extra societal pressure for men to date women who are younger. So, it’s possible that even more men are into older women than the above studies suggest, and they just don’t want to admit it!"
