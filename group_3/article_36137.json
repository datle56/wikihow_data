Baking soda is best for surface stain removal rather than for dealing with deeper brown stains.

      "content": "This helps address hard-to-remove stains. The process involves a dentist taking a detailed impression of your teeth and then crafting trays with bleaching reservoirs. This step is followed by an in-office conditioning treatment to make your teeth more responsive to whitening. At home, you wear the trays for 14 nights before returning for an in-office, chairside bleaching. Although this is a more lengthy option, it does yield results. [11] X Research source The trays you receive are customized to your mouth and, unless your teeth shift, you can use them indefinitely. It's important to continue using trays on a maintenance basis, typically once every two weeks. [12] X Research source While this process often reduces difficult stains, it is expensive.

      "content": "This is usually done for cosmetic purposes, and help improve the appearance of your teeth overall. A dentist roughens the surface of your tooth to allow a bonding material to stick. Then the stained tooth is covered with a composite resin that can be blended to coordinate with your other teeth. Tooth bonding takes between 30 minutes and 1 hour and can be completed within one visit. If you have several stained teeth, you may need to schedule multiple appointments. While the composite resin will cover existing stains, you must not eat or drink any staining substances within 48 hours of its application. Like teeth, it can also stain over time. Be aware that a composite resin lacks the strength of natural teeth and it can chip. This approach may not be a good fit, if you bite your nails. [17] X Research source"
