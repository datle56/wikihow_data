Some computers running Windows 10 or later require you to press and hold ⇧ Shift instead. For some computers, you’ll need to press and hold the appropriate key rather than tapping it. You'll typically use the \"F\" keys to access the BIOS. These are at the top of your keyboard, though you may have to locate and hold the Fn key while pressing the proper \"F\" key. You can look at your computer model's manual or online support page to confirm your computer's BIOS key."
