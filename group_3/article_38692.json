      "title": "Locate the model number on the back of the TV.",
      "content": "Locate the model number on the back of the TV. All TVs have a specific model number so stores and manufacturers know what features each one has. Look on the back side of the TV near where the cables plug in. The model number will either be on a sticker or printed directly on the TV. Write down the model number so you don't forget it. [1] X Research source It’s also possible to find the model number if you have the TV's original packaging or instruction manual."

    {
      "title": "Look up the current selling price of your TV online.",
      "content": "Look up the current selling price of your TV online. Type the model number of your TV into a search engine to see what the price is for a new TV. Many times, the price of the TV will drop from the original list price within a few months. [2] X Research source Many websites track the Amazon selling prices so you can easily see how the price has changed over time. CRT TVs that are boxy and have tubes inside them may not have a current list price since they aren't made anymore and not many people are trying to buy them."

    {
      "title": "Set the price of your TV at 20-30% off of the current selling price.",
      "content": "Set the price of your TV at 20-30% off of the current selling price. Take the current list price of the TV and multiply it by 0.2 or 0.3 to find the discount . Subtract that amount from the list price to find the asking price for your TV. If you want, start listing your TV at a higher price and negotiate down. [3] X Research source For example, if your TV's current list price is $200 USD, subtract $40 USD for 20% and $60 USD for 30%. List your TV between $140-$160 USD. Don't base your selling price off of what you originally paid for the TV. The older a certain TV model is, the cheaper it will be."
    },
    {
      "title": "Compare your price to similar items on online marketplaces.",
      "content": "Compare your price to similar items on online marketplaces. Go on websites like eBay or Craigslist and look up your TV by the model number. Look at what other sellers are asking for their TV and what others have sold for recently. If you want to price your TV so it's more likely to sell, set it equal to or just below what other people are asking for. [4] X Research source Checking online marketplaces is best for old CRT TVs that may not have current list prices."

    {
      "title": "Sell the TV locally to avoid shipping costs.",
      "content": "Sell the TV locally to avoid shipping costs. Shipping a TV can be expensive and it could get damaged in transit, so avoid selling on sites like eBay or through Amazon where you may have to ship across long distances. Instead, look for local online marketplaces, such as Craigslist or Facebook Marketplace. That way, the buyer can come pick up the TV from your home rather than having it delivered. [5] X Research source Note that Facebook Marketplace requires you to make a Facebook account . When selling on Craigslist or similar sites, keep in mind that you’re dealing with strangers. Take precautions to make sure you stay safe during the transaction. Sites like eBay also charge fees, while Facebook Marketplace and Craigslist don’t."

    {
      "title": "Write a detailed description of the TV's size and features.",
      "content": "Write a detailed description of the TV's size and features. Be sure to include the model number of your TV in the description so other people can look it up easily. State the dimensions of the TV, how old it is, the brand, and any damage it may have. Fill out the description in detail so buyers know exactly what to expect from the purchase. [6] X Research source For example, write something like: “Samsung QN65Q6FN 47” 4K Smart TV from 2016. Includes remote, instruction manual, and original box. Has a small scratch on the side, but doesn't affect the picture.” Consider also sharing when and where you bought the TV, how often you use it, and whether or not your listing includes cables and/or the TV remote. Avoid listing only the brand and size since there are many different TVs that have the same dimensions but have different features."

      "title": "Take pictures of your TV to show its condition.",
      "content": "Take pictures of your TV to show its condition. Use your phone or a digital camera to take high-quality photos of the TV so buyers can see exactly what it looks like. Include a picture of the ports on the back of the TV so people know what they can or cannot plug into it. If you listed any damage on the TV, take a picture showing the extent of it. Most importantly, take a photo while the TV is on so potential buyers can see that it works. [7] X Research source Another reason to take photos of the TV while it’s on is to avoid awkward reflections showing up in the picture. Remember to clean the TV with a microfiber cloth before taking pictures, as well. Include a photo of the remote, as well, and try to include another object, like a gaming console, in the photo so potential buyers can see the approximate size of the television. Avoid using marketing photos or pictures of just the box since it may look like you're trying to scam buyers."

      "title": "List an email or phone number so buyers can reach out to you.",
      "content": "List an email or phone number so buyers can reach out to you. There’s no point listing your TV if buyers can’t contact you! Ask them to reach out to you with any inquiries or if they want more information about the product. Communicate promptly and answer questions clearly. Once you've listed the information, the item will be visible in the marketplace.

      "title": "Erase any personal information from smart TVs.",
      "content": "Erase any personal information from smart TVs. These days, many people have smart TVs that contain a lot of personal information. If you don’t want the new buyer using your Netflix account, make sure to erase everything before selling it. Depending on the make and model, you may be able to erase everything in settings, or you may need to log out of each app individually. Double-check that all of your info is gone before unplugging the TV. [9] X Research source If necessary, do a full factory reset . This erases all settings and returns the TV to how it was when you first bought it. Sometimes, this deletes software updates, so be sure to let your buyer know if you reset the TV."

    {
      "title": "Be willing to negotiate the price with a buyer.",
      "content": "Be willing to negotiate the price with a buyer. Figure out the lowest price you’ll accept for the TV, but don’t list it at that price. That way, if someone asks if you're willing to sell it for cheaper, you can tell them a price within that range to accept. If a buyer asks for a lower price, you can still try to ask them for more money, especially if you just listed the TV or it's below your minimum. [10] X Research source For example, if you're asking $160 USD for your TV, you may choose to accept anything as low as $140 USD. Don't list the TV for the lowest price you can or else buyers will try to ask for less."

    {
      "title": "Ask for cash only for the transaction.",
      "content": "Ask for cash only for the transaction. Be upfront and ask for payment in cash so you don't get scammed by the buyer. Make sure you have enough cash on you in case you need to make change for them. [11] X Research source Don't take personal checks or money orders for your TV since they could be scams. Digital payments through apps like Venmo or Paypal are another viable option since you'll receive the funds immediately."

    {
      "title": "Let the buyer try the TV to make sure it works.",
      "content": "Let the buyer try the TV to make sure it works. If the buyer is interested in your TV, see if they want to come test it before they pick it up and pay for it. Keep the TV plugged in so the buyer can look at the picture and see how it works. If they're happy with it, ask them to pay for it to complete the sale. Have another person with you when the buyer comes over so you don't have to be alone with them."
