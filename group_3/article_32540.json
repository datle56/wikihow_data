      "content": "Fajr is one of five daily prayers, or salah, in the Islamic religion. These are mentioned in the Quran as obligatory rituals through which Muslims praise Allah, acknowledge His greatness and re-affirm their belief. Each prayer is done at a specific time of the day, and the Fajr is the dawn prayer. Muslims believe that performing the five prayers forms one of the Five Pillars of Islam. [1] X Research source The other prayers are the Dhuhr , Asr , Maghrib , and Isha . It is compulsory under Islamic law for all adult Muslims (those that have reached puberty) to complete the five prayers every day, with a few exceptions, such as during menstruation for women. Younger children should be taught by their parents to read their salah at age 7 and be made to complete all five prayers correctly and on-time every day by age 10 or be disciplined for not doing so. The Qur'an tells us that the first thing that will be examined on the Day of Judgement is our adherence to the commandment of five daily salah. This will play a key part in Allah's decision between granting entry into Jannah (Heaven) or Jahannam (Hellfire). Muslims recognize that the inevitable result of intentionally not praying is entry into Jahannam."

      "title": "Fajr is performed just before sunrise, so the time varies with the seasons and latitude.",
      "content": "Fajr is performed just before sunrise, so the time varies with the seasons and latitude. Sunrise happens at different times throughout the year and depends on your location. Check your local sunrise times and perform the prayer right before then. [2] X Research source Since the Muslim day begins at sundown, Fajr is technically the third prayer of the day, according to the Muslim calendar. However, since a conventional day starts at midnight, this makes it the first prayer of the day. If you have trouble keeping track of the times to perform Fajr, there are apps and websites that track the times in your area and remind you of the correct prayer times."

      "content": "Yes, according to the Qur'an all five prayers have to be completed correctly every day. This is an essential part of the religion and Muslims take it very seriously. [3] X Research source Adherence to the correct time for salah is very important and any lateness or errors may mean the prayer is not valid and may have to be repeated. If you do miss salah then you are required to make it up (known as Qadha salat), in the same sense that a debt has to be repaid. You can also offer voluntary prayers at different times of day in addition to the five daily prayers."

      "title": "You must face the Qiblah, or the direction of Mecca.",
      "content": "You must face the Qiblah, or the direction of Mecca. This is a key part of all Muslim prayers. Mecca is Islam's holy city, and Muslims perform their prayers towards it. In North America, the Qiblah is east and slightly north, but the direction will change depending on where you are. Find this direction and face it for the entire prayer. [4] X Research source If you’re not sure which direction to face, there are websites and apps that can help you find the right way to face."

      "title": "Fajr contains two rakats.",
      "content": "Fajr contains two rakats. A rakat is a particular series of recitations and movements making up one unit of a Muslim prayer. The Fajr prayer contains two of these rakats , meaning you’ll repeat the same movements and recitations twice. [5] X Research source The Maghrib prayer has three rakats and the other three prayers have four rakats."

      "title": "After making wudhu, start by announcing your intention to offer prayer to Allah.",
      "content": "After making wudhu, start by announcing your intention to offer prayer to Allah. Say something like “I intend to offer the Fajr prayer for Allah.” You can say this to yourself in any language. At this point you must be fully focused on your salah and your mind must not wander. Raise your hands to your ears with your palms facing the Qiblah. Then follow these steps: [6] X Research source Stand with your arms in front of you with your right hand on top of your left hand. This is called the qiyam position. Recite the following prayers in this position: Thana (\"Subhanaka Allah humma wa bihamdika, wa tabaraka ismuka, wa ta'ala jadduka, wa la ilaha ghairuk\"); Ta'awadh (\"Audu bi Allah i mina ashaitan i errajeem\"); Tasmiah (\"Bismillah i rrahman i erraheem\"); and Al-Fatihah (\"Al humdo lil-lahi rab-bil al ala-meen. Arrahman i rraheem. Maliki yaum i eddeen. Iyyaka nabudu wa iyyaka nasta een. Ihdinas sirata almustaqeem. Siratal lazhina anamta alaihim, ghairil maghdubi alaihim, wa la adhdhaal leen.\"). Finish by reciting a short Surah, or chapter, of your choice from the Quran. Say “Allahu Akbar” and bow forward with your hands on your knees. While bowing, say \"Subhana rabbiya al azeem\" three times. Stand back up and say \"Samia Allah u liman hamidah, Rab'bana lakal hamd.\" Kneel down and press your palms and face to the floor while saying “Allahu Akbar.” Say \"Subhana rabbiyal a'ala\" three times. Sit up with your hands on your thighs while saying “Allahu Akbar.” Kneel to the ground again and say “Allahu Akbar.” With your face and palms on the floor, say \"Subhana rabbiyal a'ala\" three times and raise back up. This completes the first rakat."

      "content": "Stand back up into the qiyam position while saying “Allahu Akbar.” Repeat the same prayer from the first rakat, then recite another short surah of your choice from the Quran. Follow these steps to complete the second rakat: [7] X Research source Complete the same set of steps from the first rakat. While still kneeling after completing the first steps, say your Tashahud prayer. While reciting the last line of that prayer, stick your right index finger straight out. Say your Salat Ala An-nabi prayer while still kneeling. Then say another short prayer of your choice for Allah. Turn your head to the right and say “Assalamu alaikum wa rahmatullah.” Turn to the left and say the same thing. This completes the Fajr prayer."

      "content": "Yes, Muslim tradition requires the prayers to be recited in Arabic. This might seem tough, but it just takes some practice. After a lot of repetition, you’ll be able to say the prayers correctly every time. [8] X Research source For some help memorizing and understanding the meaning of the prayers, it’s fine to look at translations in your native language. Muslim imams are generally understanding of new reverts who can’t speak or understand Arabic. They just ask that you make a strong effort to try and learn the prayers in Arabic as quickly as possible. Some more lenient imams are fine with you reading the prayers or even speaking in your native language just to get started. [9] X Research source Remember that completing all five daily salah, including Fajr, is compulsory and there are very few acceptable excuses for missing it under Islamic law."

      "content": "Yes, men and women both perform the Fajr although there are some slight differences in the way women pray. Women and men both have to perform it each morning. [10] X Research source In the Muslim tradition, women cannot lead men in prayer, and this goes for the Fajr as well. [11] X Research source Fajr time can be very early in the morning, especially in northern latitudes in summer, but the appointed time must be adhered to, even for children, or the prayer is invalid. If for some reason you miss Fajr, or any other compulsory prayer, you must sincerely repent for your mistake by acknowledging your sin to Allah, ask Him for forgiveness , promise not to repeat the mistake and make up the missed prayer. Deliberately missing Fajr may carry a discretionary legal penalty (ta'zir) in this world and a divine punishment in the Hereafter."
