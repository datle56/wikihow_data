You can only connect a console account (XBox, PlayStation, or Nintendo Switch) to your Epic Games account. [1] X Research source While this feature was available in the past, it's unlikely that Epic Games will bring it back. Additionally, you can't transfer V-Bucks from one account to another. Once the funds are added to an account, it will stay linked to that account."
