The rounds have specific requirements for what combinations of cards you need to play. At the end of the round, you’ll total up any points left in your hand.

Melds are either “sets” (3 or more cards with the same value) or “runs” (4 or more cards of the same suit in sequential order). Each round has different meld requirements that players need to achieve. The melds you need for each round are: [2] X Research source Round 1: two sets of 3 cards Round 2: one set of 3 cards & one run of 4 cards Round 3: two runs of 4 cards Round 4: three sets of 3 cards Round 5: one set of 3 cards & one run of 7 cards Round 6: two sets of 3 cards & one run of 5 cards Round 7: three runs of 4 cards Round 8: one set of 3 cards & one run of 10 cards Round 9: three sets of 3 cards & one run of 5 cards Round 10: three runs of 5 cards"

On your later turns, instead of playing melds, you can “lay off” any number of cards onto melds that you or any other players have put down on the table. [3] X Research source Example: If you have a 3 of hearts in your hand, you can lay it off on a set of 3s another player put down. Example: If you have a 4 of clubs, you could lay it off on a run that contains the 5, 6, 7, and 8 of clubs."

Any player can announce they’d like to buy the card, but the next closest player in turn order is the only one who gets the card. As a penalty for buying a card, the player also has to draw the top card of the deck. [4] X Research source Players are allowed 3 buys for each round during the first 9 rounds. In the last round, players can make up to 4 buys."

[6] X Research source Aces can be used as a high value (coming after the king) or as a low value (coming before a 2) Jokers are wild cards, so you can use them in any meld."

[10] X Research source If the round requires more than one meld, you have to play them all at the same time. If you only have one of the melds, you have to keep it in your hand until you have the others. You have to wait until you play the round’s melds before you can lay off cards, and you cannot play melds and lay off cards during the same turn."
