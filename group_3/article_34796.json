      "content": "Make sure you have the proper hardware to assemble each truck. Each skateboard requires 2 trucks. Each truck has 1 kingpin assembly and 1 hanger. Each kingpin assembly has 2 washers, 2 bushings, and 1 nut. Also, each truck requires 2 wheels. [1] X Research source Some trucks come with the hanger and kingpin already assembled and attached. You’ll have to buy the hardware (nuts, bolts, washers, bushings) separately from the truck assembly. All the parts and hardware for a skateboard can be found at skateboard stores, many of which you can order from online."

      "title": "Place the hanger into one of the large holes in the baseplate.",
      "content": "Place the hanger into one of the large holes in the baseplate. A truck baseplate typically has 6 holes in it. Four of those holes are smaller and are for the nuts and bolts that attach the baseplate to the board. The other 2 holes are larger and are for the hanger and kingpin. Start the truck assembly process by sliding the hanger into one of the larger holes. It will only fit comfortably into one of the two holes. [2] X Research source While the hanger will slide into one of the larger holes, you may need to hold it in place until it’s secured with the kingpin assembly."

    {
      "title": "Thread the kingpin through the hole in the hanger.",
      "content": "Thread the kingpin through the hole in the hanger. There will be one hole in the hanger through which the kingpin will go. Slide the kingpin through this hole, but do not push it into the second large hole in the baseplate yet. [3] X Research source The kingpin assembly needs to have a washer and a bushing threaded onto it from both sides of the hanger before it can be secured."
    },
    {
      "title": "Slide a washer and bushing onto each end of the kingpin.",
      "content": "Slide a washer and bushing onto each end of the kingpin. Slide 1 bushing and 1 washer onto one end of the kingpin. Then do the same thing on the other end of the kingpin. In both cases, the bushings should be closest to the hanger. Once all 4 items are on the kingpin, slide the kingpin into its hole on the baseplate. [4] X Research source Bushings come in different hardnesses and help control the turning behaviour of your board. [5] X Research source Tapered or conical/cone bushings make the trucks easier to turn, while flat or barrel bushings make the trucks harder to turn."

      "title": "Secure the kingpin assembly with a wrench and the kingpin nut.",
      "content": "Secure the kingpin assembly with a wrench and the kingpin nut. Slide the kingpin nut onto the kingpin. Use a skate tool or wrench to tighten the nut onto the kingpin. Tighten until it’s secure, but don’t over-tighten the nut. [6] X Expert Source Jon Depoian Skateboarding Instructor Expert Interview. 5 June 2020. Kingpin assemblies that are too tight will ruin the bushings, which will then need to be replaced. [7] X Research source Ask a skateboard shop representative for assistance when choosing which type of bushings you want for your board. You also don’t want to leave the kingpin nut loose, as that will make your board unstable."

      "title": "Repeat the same process for the second truck assembly.",
      "content": "Repeat the same process for the second truck assembly. Each skateboard needs 2 trucks, 2 hangers, and 2 kingpins. Assemble the second truck for your skateboard once you’re done assembling the first one. Follow the exact same instructions. [8] X Research source There are no front or back trucks; both trucks on a skateboard are exactly the same."

      "title": "Use something sharp to poke holes through new grip tape if needed.",
      "content": "Use something sharp to poke holes through new grip tape if needed. If the grip tape on your board is new, start by poking 8 holes through it with a sharp object like a screwdriver. The holes are already drilled through the board, you just need to slide a screwdriver through them from the underside and push until they break through the grip tape. [9] X Research source If you’re installing new trucks on an existing board, the holes in the grip tape will already be there and you can skip this step."

      "title": "Slide 4 bolts into 4 of the holes in your board, then turn it upside down.",
      "content": "Slide 4 bolts into 4 of the holes in your board, then turn it upside down. Your board has 2 sets of 4 holes. Slide 4 bolts through 1 set of 4 holes from the top of your board. Make sure the bolts are pushed all the way through the holes. Turn your board upside down so you can see the 4 ends of the bolts sticking through the board. [10] X Research source You may need to use one hand to hold the bolts in the holes while you flip the board over."

      "title": "Line the truck’s baseplate up with 4 bolts and attach the nuts.",
      "content": "Line the truck’s baseplate up with 4 bolts and attach the nuts. Slide the small holes in the truck’s baseplate over the 4 bolts now sticking through the bottom of your board. Make sure the kingpin side of the truck is facing towards the inside of the board and the hanger side of the truck is facing the outside of the board. [11] X Research source You may need to hold the bolts from the topside of your board during this step if they feel loose. Putting the truck on in the opposite direction will cause you to turn left when you lean right on your board, and vice versa."

      "title": "Use a wrench and screwdriver to tighten all the nuts.",
      "content": "Use a wrench and screwdriver to tighten all the nuts. Slide 4 nuts over the 4 bolts now holding your truck’s baseplate onto the board. Slide your skate tool or a wrench around the nut on one side of the board. Then, place your screwdriver into the head of the bolt on the top side of your board. Tighten the bolt and nut together by turning one tool and keeping the other one stationary. [12] X Expert Source Jon Depoian Skateboarding Instructor Expert Interview. 5 June 2020. Tighten the bolts/nuts such that the heads of the bolts are flush with the top side of your board. Tightening them any more than that may cause the board to crack. [13] X Research source Instead of a screwdriver, you can also use a power drill with the proper Phillips attachment to make the process go faster."

      "title": "Repeat the process to attach the second truck to your board.",
      "content": "Repeat the process to attach the second truck to your board. Remember that the side of the truck with the kingpin needs to be facing inwards. In the end, the kingpins should be facing each other across the length of the board. [14] X Research source The width of the axles on your truck (without wheels) should be the same width as your board. This helps to ensure you get the proper centre of gravity when riding your board. Trucks come in different heights and/or you can purchase risers that can be placed between your board and truck. Higher trucks are better for adults and tall people, while lower trucks are better for kids and short people."

      "content": "Double-check that you have all the hardware you need for the wheels. Now that both trucks are on your board, all you need to do is add the wheels and then you can take your board for a spin. Each wheel needs 2 bearings, 2 speed rings or washers, and 1 nut. The axle of the truck acts as the bolts for the wheels, so no separate bolts are required. For all 4 wheels, you’ll need 8 bearings, 8 speed rings, and 4 nuts. You can put the wheels onto each truck before you attach the truck to the board if you’d prefer."

      "title": "Slide 2 bearings and 1 wheel onto 1 axle to insert the bearings.",
      "content": "Slide 2 bearings and 1 wheel onto 1 axle to insert the bearings. Each wheel needs 2 bearings. Those bearings go inside the wheel from both sides. Place the 2 bearings onto 1 of the axles (doesn’t matter which axle). Slide the wheel (in either direction) onto the axle and push down hard. You should hear a click when the bearing slides into the wheel. Turn the wheel over and do the same thing for the second bearing. [15] X Research source You can use the same axle to insert all 8 bearings into all 4 wheels if you’d like. Don’t leave the wheels on the axle when you’re done. Take them off and set them aside for a moment."

Slide the second speed ring onto the axel, on the outside of the wheel, then thread the nut onto the axle and tighten with your hand. Use a wrench or a skate tool to tighten the nut further. [16] X Research source Make sure the nut is tight enough that the wheel doesn’t wobble on the axle, but loose enough to allow the wheel to spin freely."

Place the full wheel assembly on each remaining axle and tighten the assembly with the nut and a wrench. Check that all the wheels can spin freely and smoothly, if not, loosen the nuts slightly. Your board is now completely assembled and ready to go! Have fun!"
