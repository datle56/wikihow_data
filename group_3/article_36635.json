      "title": "Get a chain tool.",
      "content": "Get a chain tool. A chain tool is a small, handheld tool with a rotating handle and metal pin that pushes the rivet out of a chain link so it comes apart. You can find a chain tool online or at your local bike shop."

      "title": "Insert the pin on one of the links on your bike chain into the chain tool.",
      "content": "Insert the pin on one of the links on your bike chain into the chain tool. The chain tool should have 2 prongs on it (next to the small metal pin) that will fit around one of the links on your bike chain. Slide the link in between the two prongs so it’s securely in place. The prongs should fit in the gaps on either side of the link. Your bike chain will have outer plates, inner plates, rollers, and pins. You'll use your chain tool to push the pin out of the rollers, which makes the chain come apart. Don't insert your chain tool into any other part of the chain other than the pins, as this can damage the chain."

    {
      "title": "Turn the handle on the chain tool clockwise to push the pin into the link.",
      "content": "Turn the handle on the chain tool clockwise to push the pin into the link. The pin should make contact with the center of the chain link. When it does, keep rotating the handle clockwise. There may be some resistance, but check that the tool hasn't slipped off of the pin. As you’re rotating the handle, you should see the rivet (the pin in the center of the chain link) being pushed out the other side of the link. Stop rotating the handle when the rivet is almost all the way out of the link, as reinstalling the pin after it falls out is nearly impossible. Be very careful that your pin doesn't come all of the way out because it's very unlikely that you'll be able to get it back into the link. If you do accidentally push your pin all of the way out, you can try taking that link out and shortening your chain to the next undamaged link. However, this can make it hard for you to shift into certain gears. Another option is to visit a bike shop to ask about getting a new pin for your chain or to replace the chain. Sometimes your chain tool will slide so that it's not directly over the pin. Not only will you have a difficult time getting the chain tool to push out the pin, it can also damage the chain by deforming the outer link."

Grab the bike chain on each side of the link with your fingers and wiggle it back and forth until the link comes apart.

When the master link is in position, squeeze the handle on the pliers to close the jaws and push the master link together.

Position the other jaw on the left edge of the metal plate with the cut-out center. Gently squeeze the handle of the pliers so the jaws come together. As the jaws come together, you should hear a click and see the metal plate shift to the right. [8] X Research source Don't use too much force when trying to release the metal plate, as it's possible to trigger the spring loaded clip, making it shoot off of the bike.
