      "content": "Loosen the sides with a knife and hot water. When you're ready to serve the cake, the knife and hot water trick is the best way to remove the sides of the pan. Take a butter knife and run it under hot water, or dip it in a cup of hot water nearby. Run the knife along the edges of the cake against the sides of the pan. This loosens the cake while keeping the sides smooth. [1] X Research source You'll need to wet the knife every few inches to keep it from drying and dragging against the side of the cheesecake. Don't use cold water, as it isn't as effective as hot water. Using cold increases the chances that the cake will crack or break. Chill the cake overnight (if possible) for the best results."

      "title": "Use heat to loosen the cake from the base.",
      "content": "Use heat to loosen the cake from the base. Removing a cake from the springform pan base is more difficult than taking off the sides. It can help to use a source of heat to slightly heat the bottom of the cake, so that the butter in the crust softens and the cake is easier to move. Use one of the following techniques: A cook's blowtorch. If you're lucky enough to have one in your kitchen, this is a great tool for warming up the base of a cheesecake. Hold the pan with a potholder. Turn on the torch and with extreme care pass the lit blowtorch under the base. This will heat the butter and soften the cheese just enough to slide the cake out of the pan. Take care not to overheat it! A gas burner. Hold the pan with a potholder. Turn on your gas burner and carefully hold the cheesecake over the burner to heat up the bottom of the cake. If you don't have a gas burner, you can try a lighter. Again, be careful not to overheat the pan. It will get very hot. A knife wet with hot water. This is the least preferable method, since wetting the crust of the cake will affect its texture. If you don't have tools to directly heat the bottom of the pan, this is a good option."

      "title": "Slide the cake onto a platter.",
      "content": "Slide the cake onto a platter. Right after heating the bottom, very gently slide the cake onto a platter that you have waiting right next to it. If you have trouble removing the cake from the base, gently push it with the flat side of a large knife to encourage it to move off the base. Push the crush, not the soft cheese filling, which is easily dented. Many cooks simply leave the cake on its base instead of attempting to slide it off. Feel free to place the entire cake base on the serving platter. You can hide its edges by decorating around the cake with sliced strawberries or raspberries."

Re-dip the knife as necessary to prevent the knife from dragging at the cake. After loosening the cake, pop open the latch on the pan and lift away the sides. Don't use cold water to loosen the cake, since it isn't as effective as hot water. You can cover any cracks or gouges on the sides of the cake by using a knife dipped in hot water to smooth them over."

      "content": "Gather three large spatulas and a friend. The spatula method requires someone else's help, since the cake might break if you try to support it using just two spatulas instead of three. Three spatulas should be enough to lift the cake and safely transfer it to a platter. Choose large, flat, thin spatulas that will easily slide under the cake. [3] X Research source You may also want to heat the bottom of the cake before attempting the transfer. This will make it easier for the cake to unstick from the bottom of the springform pan."

      "title": "Slide the spatulas under the cake.",
      "content": "Slide the spatulas under the cake. Very carefully slide them between the crust and the springform pan bottom. Keep sliding as far as you can, and try to cover as much area under the cake as possible. Space the spatulas evenly around the cake so no one spot is unsupported."

Count to three with your friend and gently lift the cake onto a platter you have waiting nearby. Do it quickly, but carefully, to achieve the best results. Make sure you lift at the exact same moment, using the same speed, or else the cake will break. Once you have the cake on the platter, gently slide the spatulas out from under the cake."

      "content": "Line the pan with a circle of parchment paper. If you haven't yet baked your cake, this trick will make removing the pan much easier. Cut out a circle of parchment paper slightly larger than the base of the springform pan you're using. Press it into the bottom of the assembled springform pan. You'll bake the cake on top of the parchment, rather than directly on the pan. This way you can just slide the bottom of the cake off the pan with the parchment, which looks a lot less noticeable than a metal base. [4] X Research source Some chefs also like to use a cardboard cutout to lend the cake a little more support. Cut out a piece of cardboard the same size as the base of the springform pan. Press a piece of parchment paper over the cardboard. If you want to line the sides of the pan with parchment as well, cut a strip long enough to wrap around the inside of the pan and slightly thicker than the depth of the pan. Now you can make your cheesecake as normal, and when it is completely chilled the cake can be removed with ease from the pan."
