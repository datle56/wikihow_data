Although it's never recommended that you go out purely for the sake of finding a lifelong partner, your chances of meeting someone special are vastly higher if you make an effort to get out of the house and into the social scene. Get out with friends, and try to explore areas and situations you're not used to. The more you get out of your comfort zone, the more possibilities you'll be exposed to.

      "content": "Look for common interests and values. Interests say a lot about someone. A great deal of someone's time and experience of life will be based around their interests, and motivated by their values. Finding a soulmate can also mean finding someone whose values are a close match to your own. Finding out about someone's interests can be done through casual conversation. Looking for someone with similar hobbies can help you find a soulmate much faster. [7] X Expert Source Christina Jay, NLP Dating & Relationship Coach Expert Interview. 11 February 2020. You can increase your chances of finding a soulmate if you frequent places that relate to your interests. For instance, if you love music, you should make a habit of going to as many shows as possible. You'll meet lots of interesting people that way, and the mere fact that the two of you are in the same place together means you know you have at least one interest in common. Don't be afraid to try out someone with completely different interests. There may be a great chemistry regardless, and you'll almost always find common ground with another person. Some couples manage to make it work if they have different religious affiliations. However, having opposing views about the meaning of the universe can make it difficult to feel a total closeness.

      "content": "Keep an open mind. While it's often romanticized that you will click with your soulmate at first sight, things aren't usually that easy. To know whether you have chemistry with someone, you need to have a real talk where the two of you have the chance to open up. In some cases, you may have met a potential soulmate in passing but never had a chance to unlock the potential there. Keep an open mind when you're meeting new people. You never know who you might hit it off with. If you're finding it hard to open up to someone, chances are she's not your soulmate. The same goes both ways; if the other person seems to resist, it's unlikely that she's your soulmate."

All human relationships are imperfect by design. [9] X Research source If you find someone who makes it feel amazing to be alive, that should be enough. Any minor flaws should be taken and embraced along with the rest of the package. Major flaws should be approached with caution. If you notice glaring issues with someone, you should think twice before trying to get closer to her. Major flaws would count as something that would keep you from feeling satisfied with this person for the rest of your life. On the other hand, minor flaws may be irritating, but they're often seen as negligible compared to a person's positive aspects."

Go to source A true soulmate relationship only works if both people are willing to be completely honest about who they are. This means you need to be okay with being yourself if you want that sort of connection with somebody. If you hide a part of yourself away from the other person, you'll never know if the two of you have that full chemistry. This idea obviously goes both ways. The other person needs to be completely open with you."

One of the truest things about having a soulmate is the ability to talk to each other without any fear of judgement or censorship.

It can be a rare thing to feel completely at home in the presence of someone else. Considering how uncommon this is, a sense of safety like that could be a sign you are in the presence of a soulmate."

      "content": "Develop a mutual sense of trust. [14] X Research source Just as with any other relationship, trust is one of the most important things you can have with a soulmate. Even if you have a soulmate-worthy chemistry with someone, all of that can be destroyed through breaking trust. If you think this person is 'the one', you should be trying all that much harder to stay true and loyal to them. Even with the strongest chemistry, it can take a long time to really build up mutual trust, especially if you've had bad luck with being vulnerable in the past. Developing trust with someone after bad experiences ultimately takes a conscious decision to go out on a limb and willingly make yourself vulnerable before that person. It's not an easy thing to do for some people, but if the person in question is truly your soulmate, you'll benefit greatly from the intimacy and connection."

While some people may see a soulmate as a real, spiritual connection, most simply use the term to describe someone they have a close chemistry with. [15] X Research source In thinking this way, it's also important to recognize that there is no 'one' person out there for you. You may end up in a happy, lifelong partnership with someone special, but you could well have ended up with a number of others that could have made you just as happy. Take some time to think about it before moving ahead with finding someone. It's important not to be a perfectionist when it comes to relationships. Nothing's going to be perfect."
