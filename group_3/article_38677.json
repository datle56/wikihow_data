      "title": "Locate professional furriers in your area.",
      "content": "Locate professional furriers in your area. Find a professional furrier by looking in the phonebook or online. Call a few of the furriers in your area to see if they will examine your coat, and if you need an appointment to have them do so. [1] X Research source Choose a furrier who has training and experience, rather than an apprentice or someone who is new to the business. You may wish to have several furriers examine your coat and compare the values they provide."

      "title": "Allow the professional furrier to examine your coat.",
      "content": "Allow the professional furrier to examine your coat. Bring your coat into the shop and let the furrier examine it. This process can take anywhere from a few minutes to an hour or longer. Most furriers do not charge a fee for a fur appraisal, and the time spent is worth it so that you can resell your fur coat for the maximum value."

      "title": "Obtain an examination certificate.",
      "content": "Obtain an examination certificate. Once the furrier has completed the examination, have them give you an examination certificate or paperwork that states the value of the fur coat. Make sure the name of the furrier is listed, along with the address of their shop, the date, and the value of the coat, all printed on a company letterhead."
    },
    {
      "title": "List important details about the fur coat.",
      "content": "List important details about the fur coat. In your advertisement, note the type of fur the coat is made from, the size of the coat, and what the lining is made from. List the length and color of the fur coat as well. You should also note that your fur was examined by a furrier and provide the appraised value of the coat, as well as the asking price, if it is different. [2] X Research source You can use sites such as Craigslist , eBay , Cashforfurcoats.com, and Buymyfur.com. In order to sell your fur quickly, you might consider asking 10-20% less than what the coat was appraised for. Alternatively, look at the listing price of similar items on the site, and list your coat for 10% less than those items so your coat sells more quickly."

      "title": "Take digital photos of your coat.",
      "content": "Take digital photos of your coat. Arrange your coat on a hanger or mannequin and take photos from the front and back, as well as from each side. Also take close-up photos of the fur as well as any damaged areas. Ensure you have bright lighting so potential buyers are able to see the plushness and texture of the fur coat. [3] X Research source Take photos of your fur coat against a solid background in a contrasting color. [4] X Research source Natural light is best for taking photos of furs, but you can also use bright fluorescent lighting if necessary. [5] X Research source Position your coat near a window for natural lighting, or place your coat at a 45-degree angle from the fluorescent light source. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Upload your photos. Upload the photos of your fur coat online, and label them accordingly. Add details that let people know what they are looking at (e.g., “Front of Chocolate Brown Mink Fur Coat”). Be sure to upload several photos so potential buyers can get a feel for all aspects and angles of the coat. [7] X Research source"

      "title": "Ship the coat to the buyer.",
      "content": "Ship the coat to the buyer. If someone purchases your coat online, ensure you receive payment before shipping the item. Purchase shipping insurance in case the package gets lost or damaged. Choose a shipping container large enough for the fur coat to lay flat, rather than folding it. [8] X Research source Wrap the coat in white, acid-free tissue or packing paper. [9] X Research source Send it Priority Mail Express (or a similar service, if using a private shipping company) so that it spends less time in extreme temperatures on trucks or planes."

      "content": "Find consignment shops that sell furs. You can choose a local shop or an online consignment shop.

      "title": "Review the consignment contract.",
      "content": "Review the consignment contract. You will have to split the profits from the sale with the consignment shop, so review the policy and contract before agreeing to or signing anything. Choose the shop that has the best policy (such as offering cash rather than store credit), the most agreeable contract (perhaps one that will pay for you to ship the coat to them), and will give you the most money for your fur coat (e.g., a 70-30 split, rather than a 50-50 split)."
