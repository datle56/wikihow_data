Even if your Spanish isn't very good, you can put together a short phrase or sentence, rather than simply saying “beautiful girl.” Think about the kind of message you're trying to get across, and look up how to say something along those lines. You can find flirtatious phrases in language books, but they may be cliche or come off as canned.
