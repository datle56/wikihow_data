      "content": "Reflexology points correspond to different regions of the body. Applying pressure to a specific spot on your hand or wrist can provide targeted relief to a connected part of your body, like your eyes, ears, or internal organs. [2] X Research source Think of this chart as a map that helps you apply pressure in the correct places. [3] X Expert Source Karina Menali, L.Ac., DACM, Dipl. OM Licensed Acupuncturist & Diplomate of Oriental Medicine Expert Interview. 25 August 2021. Some of these points exist on both your left and right hands, while other points are specific to just one hand. For example, the reflexology point related to your spleen is on your left hand, while the point connected to your appendix is on your right hand. [4] X Research source This chart is called a Western hand reflexology chart. You might see different versions of it floating around the internet, as hand reflexologists don’t follow a single, universal hand reflexology chart. [5] X Research source"

Your right palm specifically connects to the gall bladder, while your left palm connects to the spleen. [12] X Research source Using reflexology techniques on these different points can help with many different issues, like intestinal and kidney pain. You can also use these points to treat organ-specific issues in your gall bladder, spleen, and liver."

      "content": "Beneath the pinky finger Trace a finger along the outer edge of your palm, starting beneath your pinky. Then, divide this line into 3 zones: the top, upper zone is split vertically between the shoulder and arm reflexology points; the central zone connects to your liver, and the lower zone connects to your hip joints. [14] X Research source Applying reflexology techniques to these points could potentially help with issues like shoulder, arm, and hip pain, along with liver issues. Picture a long vertical rectangle extending below the base of your pinky finger and into your palm. Then, split that rectangle in half vertically—the inner half of the rectangle is your shoulder reflexology point, while the outer half is your arm reflexology point."

Then, shift your thumb forward without lifting it off of the skin. Continue this pressing and gliding motion across the skin until you’ve covered the entire area. [15] X Research source To really hone your thumb-walking technique, color in the tip of your thumb with a dry erase/washable marker. Then, practice gliding your thumb over the palm. If you’re doing the technique correctly, you won’t be able to see any of the marker as your thumb moves. [16] X Research source"

Place your thumb on the top of the reflexology point (over the palm) and your pointer finger along the bottom (over the back of the hand). Pinch the area with both fingers, gliding your thumb and pointer finger in small circles as you go. [19] X Research source This technique works well for massaging the adrenal reflex. Don’t confuse these reflexology techniques with generic massage ! Hand reflexology is all about providing targeted relief through reflexology points. Massage, on the other hand, focuses more on soft tissue—not specific points."

      "content": "Indian (Ayurvedic) Hand Chart The Indian reflexology chart (or acupressure chart) contains several key differences from the Western hand reflexology chart. The reflexology points on the Indian chart are primarily located in the palm of the hand, while the fingertips solely connect to the sinus region. The thumb contains connections to the brain and the pituitary gland. The Ayurvedic chart connects the inner world with the radial (thumb side), and the outer world with the ulnar (little finger side). In keeping with the inner/outer distinction, the eye reflexology point is on the radial side of the palm, beneath the first 2 fingers (index and middle). The ear reflexology point is beneath the last 2 fingers (ring finger and pinky)."

      "content": "Korean Hand Chart The Korean hand reflexology chart is unusual in that it doesn't include any areas of the wrist—instead, areas like the reproductive organs connect to the palm of the hand. The Korean, or Koryo Hand Therapy (KHT systems) chart also displays the hands supine and prone, and makes no distinction between left and right hands. The spine, in the Korean system, connects to the central axis of the hand, along the line of the middle finger and extending down along the exterior of the hand. Each finger connects to a different region of the body in this chart."
