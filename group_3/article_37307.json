      "content": "Get the right cartridge chip reset tool. A cartridge reset tool is a plastic device with pins that, when inserted into the pinholes on your cartridge, reset the chip inside. The pins on the reset tool must line up with your cartridge's holes, which are on the bottom or side edge. Different models' cartridges have different numbers and arrangements of pin holes. To find the right chip reset tool, search the web for \"Epson cartridge chip reset tool\" along with the exact model of your printer (e.g., WT-7620). Most cartridges have either 7 or 9 pinholes in a cluster. Compare a picture of the pins on the reset tool to the number and arrangement of pinholes on the bottom of your print cartridge before purchasing. If you don't see a cluster of pinholes, look for a small green microchip somewhere on the cartridge—it will either have one single pinhole just above or below it, or two round metal contacts at the top or bottom. In this case, see the Using a Paperclip method. \"Universal\" chip reset tools are NOT universal for all models—some tools marked as \"Universal\" have 7 pins, while others have 9."

This will trick the \"empty\" cartridge into thinking it has as much ink as the other cartridge. This will only work if the chip in the other cartridge is not also out of ink. You can also use a chip from another matching cartridge for your model."
