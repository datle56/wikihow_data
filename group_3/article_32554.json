      "content": "Watch the Experts. If you are interested in learning and performing pro wrestling moves, you most likely already watch WWE and/or other wrestling circuits on television. But you may want to adjust how you watch. Pay closer attention to how the moves are performed. Watch (rewatch) body and hand positioning, takeoff and landing methods, and how wrestlers “sell” the move. Keep an eye out for the safety measures hidden within the moves. Watch videos of older wrestling shows as well. Watch for similarities and differences in technique and style. [1] X Research source Go to live wrestling shows. Even if it is a local or regional circuit with a lower caliber of performance, watching wrestlers perform in person gives you a truer sense of the complexity and power of pro wrestling maneuvers. Watch for how these ostensible opponents work in concert to complete the moves successfully and safely. Talk to some of the wrestlers if you get the chance, and let them know about your interest in learning. They may have valuable advice."

      "content": "Prepare your body. Strength training is obviously important, but so too is endurance and flexibility training. Good pro wrestlers don’t just pump iron, they do intensive cardio workouts and do plenty of stretching -- even yoga! Improving your physical conditioning will give you some added protection against injury. If you’re in high school, joining the wrestling team might make sense, but playing sports in general will help with conditioning and body control. Some strength training exercises to consider include: bench presses; chin-ups; dips; biceps curls; hand grips; wrist rolls; leg curls; leg extensions; squats; leg presses; shoulder shrugs; and 4-way neck presses. [2] X Research source Some cardio workouts to consider include: 3-mile timed runs; 10 x 400 meter interval runs; 30 minute recovery jogs; [3] X Research source and other cardio activities such as swimming and biking. Train hard, but allow time for recovery. This is when your muscles (including your cardiovascular system) heal and in the process become stronger."

      "content": "Know the risks. Watching pro wrestlers closely should give you a better idea of the intricate detail and precise timing needed to successfully complete even seemingly simple wrestling maneuvers. You’ll want to start trying out the moves you’ve been watching the pros do, maybe on your buddy in the backyard, but do not attempt them until you have been properly trained. Training, preparation, and practice will make doing wrestling moves safer, but even seasoned professionals can meet a tragic end when attempting them. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Go to a wrestling school.",
      "content": "Go to a wrestling school. If you don’t know of any in your area, contact your state athletic commission for help in finding one. [5] X Research source Seek out a school with a track record of effective, safe training. Here’s an instance where striking up that conversation with wrestlers at a local show might pay off. Be realistic with your goals. If you’re dreaming of becoming a WWE superstar, your local wrestling school almost certainly won’t cut it. Most pros train at large schools in Florida, run by former pros with a long track record. But that doesn’t mean a local wrestling school can’t provide an instructive and fun experience that could turn into something bigger if you prove you have the right stuff."

      "content": "Know what to expect. Each wrestling school will be different, but expect regular instruction sessions with other aspiring wrestlers. You will work together on building your skills inside the ring, of course, but also outside it as well -- things like character creation and interviewing. Expect, and in fact demand, honest opinions on your skills. [6] X Research source Wrestling instructors are unlikely to be shy about giving their opinion, so you’ll need a thick skin. Think of it as tough love -- doing these moves safely and effectively requires precision every time."

      "content": "Be on the same page as your opponent. When you do begin to practice moves, remember that successful pro wrestling moves always require successful execution by both parties. Start slow and build up a familiarity and trust factor with your practice ring foes. Pro wrestlers tend to think of their ring mates more as teammates than opponents. [7] X Research source They need to practice and execute together in order to succeed, just like a basketball team."
