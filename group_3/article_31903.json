  "steps": [
    {
      "title": "“I’m on board.”",
      "content": "“I’m on board.” This is a professional way to let someone know you approve of their plan or statement. When you board a ship, you’re getting on it—so this is like saying you’re on the other person’s figurative ship because you support what they’re saying. [1] X Research source Example : “I’m on board with that idea. Want to discuss specifics?”"
    },
    {
      "title": "“Agreed.”",
      "content": "“Agreed.” As a synonym for “Sounds good,” this is short, sweet, yet still professional-sounding. “Agreed” indicates that you and the other person agree on something, and you can use it whether you’re addressing colleagues, superiors, or someone you’re negotiating with. [2] X Research source Example : “Agreed. Let’s meet tomorrow to go over the timeline of this project.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "“I’m looking forward to it.”",
      "content": "“I’m looking forward to it.” Even though this phrase doesn’t directly agree with something, “I’m looking forward to it” still expresses approval by showing that you’re excited for the other person’s plans to be put into action. It works in professional settings, though you can also say it to friends! [3] X Research source Example : “I’m looking forward to working with you on this! It’ll be a great learning experience.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "“That is acceptable.”",
      "content": "“That is acceptable.” “That is acceptable” expresses agreement with a more formal tone, but it’s also a little more neutral. That means it’s ideal for situations where you want to sound reserved and professional (meaning you don’t want to appear overly casual or enthusiastic), such as communications with superiors or clients. [4] X Research source Example : “That timeline is acceptable, but we can’t afford any more delays.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "“We can make that happen.”",
      "content": "“We can make that happen.” “We can make that happen” is an action-oriented statement; it indicates approval while conveying your willingness to help and make ideas a reality. It’s ideal when discussing team-based plans, projects, or proposals at work. Example : “Great idea! We can make that happen if we do a little reorganizing.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "“This is a solid plan.”",
      "content": "“This is a solid plan.” This statement directly conveys your agreement and approval of someone’s plan, and it compliments their ability to make plans simultaneously. You can use it in most professional contexts, especially when sharing ideas between colleagues. Example : “This looks like a solid plan. Great job! I think it’ll be effective.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "“I’m pleased with…”",
      "content": "“I’m pleased with…” Specify whatever you’re “pleased with” at the end of this statement to express approval of it. “I’m pleased” is a more formal way to say “Sounds good,” so this statement is a fantastic option to use when you want to sound professional around coworkers or superiors. Example : “I’m pleased with this project so far. I think we’re making great progress.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "“That’s fine.”",
      "content": "“That’s fine.” “That’s fine” can be used in many different contexts; you can use it in semi-formal settings (between coworkers on your level or at a workplace with a more casual atmosphere overall) and also in casual situations outside of work entirely. Regardless, it’s an expression of polite approval, though it’s not super enthusiastic. [5] X Research source Example : “That time is fine with me. I look forward to our conversation tomorrow.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "“Sure thing!”",
      "content": "“Sure thing!” “Sure thing” is a short and friendly affirmation—much like saying, “Of course!” or “I can do that!” It’s ideal for letting someone know you can do what they’ve asked or agreeing with their suggestion, and you can use it among both colleagues you’re on good terms with and friends. [6] X Research source Example : “Sure thing, I’d love to hang out tomorrow!”"
    },
    {
      "title": "“Let’s do it.”",
      "content": "“Let’s do it.” “Let’s do it” is another informal way of agreeing to someone else’s plan. It’s also enthusiastic, indicating that you like their suggestion and are totally game for it. It’s mainly used among friends—though you can use it casually among coworkers, too. Example : “Want to go to the mall today?” “Let’s do it!”"
    },
    {
      "title": "“Count me in.”",
      "content": "“Count me in.” When someone asks you if you want to do something or join in on an activity—whether it’s a friend or coworker you get along with—you can say “Count me in” to confirm that you’re interested and plan to participate. You can also shorten the phrase to a simple “I’m in!” Example : “Heading to the bar after work? Count me in!”"
    },
    {
      "title": "“That works for me.”",
      "content": "“That works for me.” This phrase is versatile—you can use it at work for communications that don’t need to be super formal or among friends. It’s a great phrase to use when you need to quickly agree to a plan and confirm that it fits your schedule, whether you’re sending a text or a work email. You can also shorten it to “Works for me!” [7] X Research source Example : “Dinner at 7 pm works for me. Did you have any place in mind?”"
    },
    {
      "title": "“Sounds like a plan.”",
      "content": "“Sounds like a plan.” Instead of “Sounds good,” you can say, “Sounds like a plan,” which is another way to earnestly approve of someone’s plan (and show that you’re ready to put it into action). It’s ideal for casual work interactions among colleagues or just among friends. [8] X Research source Example : “A spa day would be amazing—a visit this weekend sounds like a plan to me!”"
    },
    {
      "title": "“I’d be okay with that.”",
      "content": "“I’d be okay with that.” If you’re trying to agree without sounding too enthused about it, “I’d be okay with that” does the trick. It indicates that, even if you agree, you’re either being a little cautious or just don’t strongly prefer the suggestion in question. It’s like saying you don’t have any objections (or alternative suggestions). [9] X Research source Example : “I’d be okay with doing that, but let’s check with everyone else, too.” An even more casual way to say this is, “I’m good with that!” For example, say someone asks if you’re interested in going to the zoo. You could reply, “Yeah, I’m totally good with that!” if you like the idea."
    },
    {
      "title": "“Fine by me.”",
      "content": "“Fine by me.” “Fine by me” is a more relaxed, easygoing expression of approval. It shows people that you’re agreeable and flexible, making it ideal for casual work exchanges when you want to approve of something that isn’t super important or without making a big fuss about it. [10] X Research source Example : “That plan is fine by me. Did you run it by Kim, too?”"
    },
    {
      "title": "“That sounds like a good idea.”",
      "content": "“That sounds like a good idea.” This phrase is a little more emphatic than “Sounds good,” adding extra sincerity to show that you genuinely like the other person’s idea. It’s usable among friends or during informal exchanges at work when you want to compliment someone’s suggestions or plans. Example : “That sounds like a good idea; I think we should bring it up to the rest of the team, too.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "“No problem!”",
      "content": "“No problem!” “No problem” is another easygoing response you can use to show someone that their request isn’t an inconvenience to you. Try using it in casual exchanges (either at work or among friends) when you want to be helpful or reassure someone that you aren’t put out by what they’re suggesting. Example : “No problem! I don’t have much going on today, so I’m happy to lend a hand.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "“Absolutely!”",
      "content": "“Absolutely!” “Absolutely” is an expression of strong agreement—it conveys that you agree or approve of something and are enthusiastic about it! You can use it in just about any type of casual conversation or exchange, whether you’re agreeing to a friend’s plan or letting a customer know you can definitely help them out. Example : “I can absolutely help you with that! What sort of issues are you having?”"
    },
    {
      "title": "“Of course.”",
      "content": "“Of course.” Much like “absolutely,” this phrase is a strong (and sincere) expression of agreement. You can also use it to give someone permission for something; regardless, you can use it during any informal exchanges between friends, coworkers, or customers to convey your willingness or acceptance. Example : “Of course we can meet up. I’m happy to chat about this assignment in-depth!”"
    },
    {
      "title": "“Great!”",
      "content": "“Great!” Generally, “great” is a bit more enthusiastic than \"good,\" so you can say “Great!” (or “Sounds great!”) when you want to express a little extra approval or agreement with someone. It also works for any casual interactions at work or outside of it—and there are plenty of synonyms you can swap with “great” for variation. [11] X Research source Example : “Sounds great! I’m excited to grab lunch with you.” You can use other (similar) words instead of “great,” too. For example: Perfect! Awesome! Wonderful! Splendid! Fantastic! Lovely! Fabulous!"
    },
    {
      "title": "“That’s cool!”",
      "content": "“That’s cool!” This is definitely a casual phrase, ideal for friends and family. “That’s cool” can be a solid reply when someone suggests a plan or lets you know what they had in mind the next time you spend time together. You can use it interchangeably with “Sounds cool” or even “Sounds fun!” Example : “That’s cool; I’m totally down to go bowling this weekend. Sounds like fun!”"
    },
    {
      "title": "“Sounds good” can be used in the workplace and among friends.",
      "content": "“Sounds good” can be used in the workplace and among friends. Although it’s casual, “sounds good” is a perfectly polite phrase to use at work, as long as you leave it out of the more formal business communications. If you’re on good terms with a colleague, odds are it’s okay to use. If you don’t know someone well or you’re talking to a superior, you might want something more formal. Pros : “Sounds good” is an upbeat and agreeable phrase that sounds warmer than other, more formal statements. Cons : “Sounds good” may read as unprofessional in more formal situations, depending on the person you’re saying it to."
