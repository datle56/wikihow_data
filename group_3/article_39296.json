Whether you want to save time, avoid mess, or get a close shave without irritating your skin, there are basically two types of electric shaver to use: rotary and foil. Rotary shavers utilize a revolving motion that guarantees a closer shave. [4] X Research source This is a very popular choice because it doesn’t pull hair and provides a comfortable shave. The three rotating mechanisms of a rotary shaver can help with hard to reach areas. Flexibility can depend on the brand so do your research to accommodate the contours of your face. Titanium blades that form part of the rotary mechanism aid in painless shaving. [5] X Research source A foil shaver has oscillating blades behind steel foils that lifts the hair out of the face as opposed to cutting it. These electric shavers have 3 to 4 blades and more blades means a reduced shaving time but can also be more noisy . The large head allows you to cover more area so this choice may be right for you if you want a quick and efficient shave. [6] X Research source"
