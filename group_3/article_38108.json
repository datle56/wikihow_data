      "content": "Set your performance preferences. Rendering uses the bulk of your CPU power for the time it takes to create your animation. This can be an hour or more! With the default settings, you won't be able to use your computer for other purposes while the animation is rendering. If you want, you can tell Blender to use less CPU power: Expand the Performance header in the Render Properties panel. If \"Auto-Detect\" is selected for \"Threads Mode,\" Blender will autodetect your CPUs and display how many threads will be used. It'll be the maximum amount by default, which ensures the animation will render the fastest, leaving you little power to do much else. If you want to keep using your computer during rendering, select Fixed as the Threads Mode, and enter a fewer number of threads. For example, if the Auto-Detect detected 8 threads, decreasing it to 6 will allow you to still get work done while rendering."

[1] X Research source If you want to increase or decrease the resolution, you can specify new values here. To increase or decrease by percentage, click the default percentage value (100%) and change it to a different value. 100% should be fine for most people."

The \"Frame Start\" and \"Frame Stop\" values should align with the number of frames you have in your animation (check the Start and End values below your animation's bottom-right corner).

Click the button with a folder and a plus sign on it to create a new directory. Type a name for the directory, such as \"Render\" or \"Animation.\" Select your new directory and click Accept .

      "content": "Select the output format. There are two choices for rendering your output: As images: The default output format is PNG . If you keep the default or select another format under \"Image,\" Blender will first render the animation as individual images, which you can then quickly convert to video using the Video Sequence Editor. Blender recommends this choice for rendering animations. [2] X Research source If you have to stop the rendering process or your computer loses power while rendering, you won't lose your progress, because you're creating individual image files. You'll also be able to edit any of the images individually before processing into a movie. If you have a transparent background, select RGBA as the \"Color\" value. Otherwise, you can use \"RBG\" for a smaller file size. As a video: If you choose one of the \"Movie\" formats, Blender will immediately render the animation to the selected video type. This is sometimes a better choice for much smaller or lower-resolution animations, but you'll run the risk of having to restart rendering if your computer (or Blender) crashes or loses power. If you choose a movie file, select FFmpeg , as it will give you the best quality without a massive file size. You should also leave the Video Codec as H.264."

If you're rendering as images first, you can stop the rendering process at any time by closing this window. You can then restart the rendering process where you left off.
