      "content": "Unplug your Christmas lights. Always unplug anything electrical before you work on it so you don’t electrocute yourself. Find the socket that enters the wall, take a firm hold of the socket, and pull it out of the wall. Don’t pull the socket out from the cord, as this could damage your lights. [1] X Research source Before unplugging, test your lights to verify that they are still not working. Turn on the switch to see if they light up. If all the lights on a strand suddenly stop working, it’s usually a strong indication that a fuse has blown. Woo suggests that you “first check the outlet the Christmas lights were plugged into to make sure there's power present.” [2] X Expert Source Marvin Woo Licensed Electrician Expert Interview. 1 December 2021."

      "content": "Find the male sockets and make sure they’re marked. Male sockets are those with metal prongs (plugs) as opposed to those that receive the plugs. Male sockets are the only ones that have fuses in Christmas tree lights, and they’re plugged into other light strands or into the wall. If a socket has a fuse, it will be marked with an arrow pointing away from the cord and a sliding door that conceals the fuse.

Make sure not to miss any male sockets that aren’t working properly. If a fuse is not working, the entire light strand will not work."

Woo says the fuse is “usually right there in the plug end behind a cover that slides or flips open.” [4] X Expert Source Marvin Woo Licensed Electrician Expert Interview. 1 December 2021. Some doors can be opened by pushing it with your finger, while others may require a small flathead screwdriver. If the door won’t come up by hand, use the screwdriver to gently pry it up. Don’t use too much pressure, as you don’t want to damage the socket or fuses underneath. [5] X Research source Find the grooves on the socket door, which should be relatively obvious to your touch. You may be able to push it up with your fingernails, but don’t force it if it does not come up easily. A kitchen knife can also work if you don’t have a flathead screwdriver. Just be careful not to cut yourself."

      "content": "Remove the fuses and examine them for damage. Most Christmas tree lights contain two fuses, but some may only have one. Carefully pop them out with your screwdriver and examine them for damage. Burnt fuses appear dark and/or cloudy and need to be replaced. [6] X Research source The fuses should be located immediately behind the socket door. They are very small, so be careful not to lose them. The fuses should be easy to remove. Don’t use too much force or you could damage them. Some fuses may be burnt but do not show external signs. In this case, use a voltmeter to check their strength. If the voltmeter doesn’t register anything, the fuse is burnt and needs to be replaced."

      "content": "Insert the new fuses. Most Christmas lights come with replacement fuses , so locate these if you still have them. Place the new fuses into the fuse socket. They should pop right into place, so don’t force them in. Make sure both fuses are secure in the grooves of the socket, then close the plug door. [7] X Research source Usually, the spare fuses are in little plastic bags taped to the Christmas light set. If you no longer have the spare fuses, purchase new ones from an electronics store or online. Be aware it may be difficult to find the fuses at stores that do not specialize in Christmas lights or electrical repairs. If you used a screwdriver to open the socket door, you may need it to close it, as well."

If the fuse was the issue, they should light up. If the lights still do not work, there may be another issue rather than burnt fuses. Make sure the socket door is securely closed. You don’t want your fuses to fall out of place. If the lights still don’t work, check your cords for any fraying, verify that all the bulbs are secured and working, and make sure your socket is in good shape."

      "content": "Look for visible burn marks on the fuse. Take the fuse out of the socket and examine it closely. In most cases, simply looking at the fuse will be enough to tell if it’s burnt. Burnt fuses typically have dark staining that looks like a burn mark. This is one of the strongest indications that a fuse will no longer work. [9] X Research source"

      "content": "Make sure the filament is still intact. If there are no visible marks on the fuse, it could still be blown. An intact filament will look like a thin, continuous wire running from the metal cap on one side of the fuse to the metal cap on the other side. If the filament appears broken or you can’t see it, the fuse needs to be replaced. [10] X Research source"

      "title": "Use a multimeter to check the voltage.",
      "content": "Use a multimeter to check the voltage. If you can’t determine if the fuse is blown just by looking at it, use an electrical continuity tester or the ohm setting on a multimeter to test the voltage. If the continuity test is negative or the ohm reading is infinite, the fuse is unusable and should be replaced. [11] X Research source"

      "content": "Make sure your lights are in good, undamaged condition. Before installing your lights, examine the strands closely to check for damage. Look for frayed wires and loose bulbs, and replace any strands with extensive damage. If the lights are 10-years-old or older, it’s probably time to replace them. [12] X Research source Make sure your lights are designed for the area you intend to use them. For example, if the lights are made for indoor use, don’t use them outdoors , as they aren’t designed to withstand water damage and harsh weather conditions. [13] X Research source When you’re done with your lights for the season, store them properly to prevent damage. Try wrapping them around a piece of cardboard or even around a Pringles can."

      "title": "Don’t over-plug your outlets.",
      "content": "Don’t over-plug your outlets. If you plug all of your light strands into one outlet, the outlet could overheat and cause the fuses to blow. Use multiple outlets, and check your lights’ wattage and your home’s amperage to determine how many strands you can safely plug into one outlet. [14] X Research source Your home’s amperage can usually be found printed near your main circuit breaker. Limit the amount of extension cords you use, as well, for the same reasons."

      "content": "Switch to LED lights if you haven’t already. If you’ve been using incandescent lights, consider switching to low-voltage LED lights instead.

      "content": "Why is half of my strand of Christmas lights out? Long strands of Christmas lights often contain more than one circuit. If only half of the strand isn’t working , there’s probably something wrong with that circuit, like a burned-out or loose bulb. Check the strand and replace any loose or damaged bulbs to see if that fixes the problem. [16] X Research source"

If the lights are already hanging or on the tree, though, removing and replacing them can sometimes be more time-consuming than it’s worth. It’s ultimately up to you to determine if it’s worth it."

      "content": "Should I hire a professional? Christmas light fuses are relatively easy to replace, so it isn’t usually necessary to hire a professional. Just don’t work on exterior lights if the weather is wet, icy, or otherwise dangerous. If you have a large outdoor light display and don’t want to spend a lot of time repairing them , consider hiring local Christmas light installers instead. Additionally, if you’re dealing with exposed wires, leave it to the professionals to be safe. [18] X Research source"
