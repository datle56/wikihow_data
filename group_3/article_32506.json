      "content": "Let the prawns cool so you’re able to touch them comfortably. If the prawns you’re peeling have just finished cooking, wait about 10 minutes or so before peeling them. The meat under the shells can stay hot for several minutes, so let them cool a bit before handling them with your hands."

      "content": "Twist to remove the head of the prawn. Pinch the prawn’s head between your thumb and pointer finger. With your other hand, pinch the body of the prawn. Then, twist your hands in opposite directions and pull them slightly away from each other until the head of the prawn pops off. [1] X Research source If you’re having trouble twisting off the head, you can also remove it by cutting it off with a sharp knife."

      "title": "Squeeze and pull to remove the legs.",
      "content": "Squeeze and pull to remove the legs. Starting with the legs closest to top (where the head used to be), grab the legs between your thumb and index finger. Squeeze tightly so you have a firm grip, then pull the legs away from the shell. [2] X Research source Repeat this process until all the legs are removed."

      "title": "Peel back the shell to remove it from the body.",
      "content": "Peel back the shell to remove it from the body. Once the legs are removed, grab ahold of the edge of the shell with your thumb and index finger. Then, pull the shell up and over the body of the prawn, peeling it over the curve as you go. Once the shell is separated from the body, tug on it to release it from the tail. [3] X Research source Every so often, you may find a prawn with a particularly mushy or soft shell. If this is the case, you may have to pull the shell off in pieces, as mushy and soft shells tend to rip or break fairly easily. The tail of the prawn may fall off as you peel off the shell."

      "title": "Pull on the tail of the prawn if you want to remove it.",
      "content": "Pull on the tail of the prawn if you want to remove it. If the tail of the prawn is still attached after you’ve removed the shell, you can remove it easily by pinching it with your fingers and pulling it away from the body of the prawn. For a more upscale presentation, however, you can leave the tails of the prawns attached. [4] X Research source If you’re planning to eat the prawns in a single bite, or if you’re adding them to a recipe, you’ll likely want to remove the tails. Leaving the tails attached can also make it easier to grab the prawns for dipping into a sauce. [5] X Research source"

Then, use the tip of the knife to dig under the vein and lift it up out of the meat. Grab the vein with your fingers and pull gently to slide it out of the prawn.

      "content": "Lay the prawns out on a flat surface. To begin, spread all the prawns out on a flat surface, such as a cutting board or plate. You’ll need to be able to pin the prawns down in place, so choose a flat surface that isn’t too slippery. You may also want to set out a bowl or have a trash can nearby for discarding the heads, shells, legs, and tails as you remove them from each prawn."

Make sure that you press firmly enough so that the prawn won’t slide or move. While you want to press down firmly to hold the prawn in place, make sure that you don’t press so hard that you squish or crush the shell into the meat."

Then, keeping the prawn securely in place, press down firmly on the spoon. Once the spoon penetrates the neck of the prawn, slide the spoon away from the prawn’s body while still pressing it down. [7] X Research source The head of the prawn should scoop off easily. If it doesn’t, however, you can also use a knife to cut off the head."
