      "title": "Plug in your Ninja and open the air fryer basket.",
      "content": "Plug in your Ninja and open the air fryer basket. Ensure that your Ninja air fryer is properly connected to a power source, then open it and remove any racks or accessories inside. This allows for proper air circulation while preheating. [1] X Research source If this is your first time using your Ninja air fryer, be sure to remove any packaging and promotional materials. Otherwise, the only accessory you should need to remove is the multi-layer rack. Make sure the crisper plate is inserted into the basket."

    {
      "title": "Reinsert the basket and set the temperature.",
      "content": "Reinsert the basket and set the temperature. First, press the “Power” button to turn the air fryer on. Then, use the “temp” arrows on your air fryer to set your desired preheating temperature. In general, this temperature will be about 400 degrees Fahrenheit (200 degrees Celsius), though it may differ depending on what you’re cooking. Always follow the instructions provided on the package or in the recipe. [2] X Research source Note that the fryer basket must be inserted during preheating. Because this is the part that will come in contact with your food, it needs to be properly heated."

    {
      "title": "Press “Start” and monitor the temperature.",
      "content": "Press “Start” and monitor the temperature. After setting the temperature and pressing the “Start” button, your air fryer will begin preheating. It should display the current temperature on its screen. Keep an eye on the display to know when it reaches the desired temperature. This usually takes 3 to 5 minutes. [3] X Research source If it helps, you can set a timer for the 3 to 5 minutes by adjusting the “Time” arrows before pressing “Start.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "Add your ingredients once the fryer is preheated.",
      "content": "Add your ingredients once the fryer is preheated. When your Ninja air fryer reaches the desired temperature, it should beep to indicate that it’s ready. Some models also have a light that turns on when preheating is complete. Once the fryer is properly heated, press “Pause,” then open the basket and place your food inside. Close the air fryer and hit “Start” again to allow your food to cook for the required amount of time. [4] X Research source Be sure to adjust the timer by again using the “Time” arrows. When the timer ends, your air fryer should beep and display “End” on the screen."

      "title": "The Ninja air fryer’s user manual recommends 3 minutes.",
      "content": "The Ninja air fryer’s user manual recommends 3 minutes. In general, air fryers take about 3 to 5 minutes to preheat . The exact amount of time depends on the desired temperature and the food you’re cooking. Always follow the instructions provided by your recipe or the food’s packaging for best results.

      "title": "Yes, it’s recommended if you want crispy, delicious results.",
      "content": "Yes, it’s recommended if you want crispy, delicious results. Regardless of the brand or model of your fryer, preheating ensures your food cooks evenly. Adding your ingredients before the air fryer has properly preheated may negatively impact cooking performance. If you want your food to taste its best, it’s probably better to preheat. [6] X Research source Preheating also helps seal in your food’s juices. When the food hits the hot surface, it immediately begins to sizzle, which results in a moist and flavorful meal. It helps ensure food safety, as well. By preheating your air fryer, you help eliminate any potential bacteria in the cooking chamber. This way, you know your food is cooked properly and safely."

      "title": "Preheating allows for faster cooking times.",
      "content": "Preheating allows for faster cooking times. When you preheat your air fryer, you already have a hot environment when you put your food in. Since you don’t have to wait for the fryer to reach the correct temperature, your food will cook faster. This is beneficial for when you want a quick bite or you’re in a hurry. [7] X Research source"

      "title": "It's not recommended since the oil may negatively affect the quality of your food.",
      "content": "It's not recommended since the oil may negatively affect the quality of your food. Generally, preheating with oil isn’t recommended, as it can bake into the basket. Not only does this make the basket sticky, but it may give your food a burnt taste. On some extreme occasions, adding oil can also cause the air fryer to overheat. [8] X Research source"

      "title": "Instead, spray with cooking spray after preheating.",
      "content": "Instead, spray with cooking spray after preheating. As soon as your Ninja air fryer finishes preheating, spray it with a cooking spray or olive oil, then add your food. This will help prevent sticking without affecting the quality of your food. [9] X Research source"

      "title": "Preheat chicken wings for a crispy texture.",
      "content": "Preheat chicken wings for a crispy texture. Always follow the preheating instructions provided by your recipe, but in general, it’s recommended to preheat your air fryer to ensure your chicken wings turn out juicy and crispy. Preheat your Ninja air fryer for 3-5 minutes at around 400 degrees Fahrenheit (204 degrees Celsius), then place the chicken wings into the fryer basket in a single layer. [10] X Research source Do the same for any breaded foods, like chicken tenders or onion rings. Preheating allows the breading to brown and crisp correctly."

      "title": "Lightly toss sweet potato fries in oil before preheating.",
      "content": "Lightly toss sweet potato fries in oil before preheating. While you generally shouldn’t coat your air fryer with oil before preheating, tossing sweet potato fries in a bit of oil helps them crisp perfectly. Allow your air fryer to preheat, as usual, for 3-5 minutes at 400 degrees Fahrenheit (204 degrees Celsius). Arrange the fries in a single layer. [11] X Research source Do the same for homemade french fries. Cooking time may vary depending on the type of potato you use, so again, always follow the preheating and cooking instructions provided by your recipe."

      "title": "When cooking frozen foods, preheat a few minutes longer than usual.",
      "content": "When cooking frozen foods, preheat a few minutes longer than usual. Because frozen food has to thaw properly before cooking, it takes a bit longer than fresh or refrigerated ingredients. To ensure your food thaws and cooks evenly, it’s generally recommended to preheat your air fryer a bit longer than usual. If you normally preheat for 3-5 minutes, try preheating for 7-8 instead. Experiment with preheating times to find what works best. [13] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Do not overcrowd the basket.",
      "content": "Do not overcrowd the basket. If your ingredients are stacked on top of each other, they won’t brown and crisp properly. Try to arrange your food in a single layer on the bottom of the basket. If your ingredients do overlap, shake them halfway through the cook time so they cook more evenly. [14] X Research source"

      "title": "Avoid using aluminum foil or parchment paper.",
      "content": "Avoid using aluminum foil or parchment paper. While lining the air fryer basket with foil might make clean-up easier, it can block the air circulation. As a result, your food may cook unevenly. It’s best to avoid using parchment paper or aluminum foil during preheating. [16] X Research source"

      "content": "Reduce the temperature for conventional oven recipes. These days, many recipes come with specific instructions for cooking in an air fryer, but some only list the temperatures and cook times for conventional ovens. If this is the case, Ninja recommends reducing the temperature by 25 degrees Fahrenheit (13.8 degrees Celsius) and checking your food frequently to prevent overcooking. [17] X Research source"
