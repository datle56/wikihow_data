War is typically played with just 2 people, but you can play with more people if you have a larger group. Strip war is a great game to play with your significant other if you want to spice up your relationship. Consider making your next date night a sexy game night instead!"

      "content": "Make sure everyone is wearing an equal amount of clothing. Make sure you and your opponent are wearing the same number of items so it’s a game. Choose which clothes you’re each comfortable taking off so everyone knows what pieces are fair game. Decide on what “counts” as clothing. For example, if one person is removing socks and jewelry, it’s not very fair if the other person is only wearing a shirt and pants. Don’t pressure anyone into taking off more clothes than they feel comfortable with. Respect their decision so they don’t feel uncomfortable throughout the game."

Decide with your opponent if the Ace should be the very lowest card (1) or the highest card above the King. If you’re playing with Jokers, then they’re the highest rank and beat any other card.

Keep the cards face down in a neat stack in front of you so neither you nor your opponent knows which cards you have. [2] X Research source You can include Jokers in your game if you’d like. Just give each player 27 cards instead of 26. The cards that you're flipping over will be a surprise to both you and your opponent, so the game is more exciting!"

You can either plan the order you remove clothes ahead of time, or let the winner choose what article of clothing the loser has to remove. If you choose the order ahead of time, you might have losers remove their socks first, then their shirt, then their pants, and then any undergarments (if they feel comfortable)."

You and your opponent both put down the next card in your stack face down on top of the first one. Then, flip the following card in your stack face-up.

If a player takes off their last item of clothing, then they lose. If a player wins all the cards in the deck, then they’ve won! Stripping only during tiebreakers makes the game a little bit longer because ties are not as common."

[7] X Research source The losers of the tiebreaker all have to remove one article of clothing, either in the order the players decided or whatever the winner chooses.
