      "title": "Oneitis is an unrealistic romantic obsession with another person.",
      "content": "Oneitis is an unrealistic romantic obsession with another person. It’s a slang term that describes a sort of psychological condition (hence the “itis”) where a person decides that their romantic interest is “the one,” despite a lack of evidence or any meaningful relationship. It’s most often used when a man fixates on or idealizes a woman, to the point where it negatively affects his behavior. [1] X Research source That said, anyone can have it, not just men. Often, oneitis occurs when a man focuses on a woman he barely knows, or who has already turned down his advances. Example usage: “Dude, you need to get over your oneitis. You’ve barely even talked to Stacy and you’re already convinced that she’ll marry you.”"

      "content": "Some say there are 3 “levels” of oneitis. Oneitis comes in a few different forms, and it might look different for one person than another. [2] X Research source It’s often said that there are 3 different levels or degrees of oneitis. The first is more of a casual fixation, when you meet someone and just can’t stop thinking about them. Level 2 is the typical case, when the fixation becomes distracting or personally damaging. Level 3 oneitis is more serious, and is when the fixation veers into harmful behavior like stalking, making repeated unwanted advancements, or becoming visibly agitated or jealous."

      "title": "Oneitis can be caused by rejection or breakups.",
      "content": "Oneitis can be caused by rejection or breakups. It’s no secret that we tend to want what we can’t have. When you go through a rejection or a breakup, it may make the other person seem even more appealing, since they hold the power of choice. [3] X Research source But rejections and breakups happen to everyone, and it’s important to understand and move past that rejection to live a fuller, healthier life. This tends to be especially true if you’ve had a sexual encounter with the person, like a hookup. This sexual element makes them all the more alluring and distracting."

      "title": "Oneitis can be caused by lack of self-esteem or other emotional hangups.",
      "content": "Oneitis can be caused by lack of self-esteem or other emotional hangups. Oneitis might also be the product of a sort of “savior complex,” or the belief that someone, someday, will come along and fix everything that’s wrong with you. This person will be perfect, and you’ll be perfect with them. But nobody’s perfect, and looking for a savior is bound to end in disillusionment.

      "title": "Oneitis may be caused by perceptions of masculinity or “honor.”",
      "content": "Oneitis may be caused by perceptions of masculinity or “honor.” Sometimes, we might think that by pursuing a single person, we’re showing them that we care, or that we have “honor” or chivalry by not pursuing others. Or, we might look past the warning signs with the excuse of “unconditional love,” thinking that if it’s meant to be, it’ll be. [5] X Research source But these are often just blinders that prevent us from accepting that maybe they’re not “the one,” and that love is waiting for us somewhere else. If masculinity is your concern, understand that the more positive and honorable thing to do as a man is to honor that person’s space and boundaries, rather than pursuing them despite their lack of interest."

      "content": "Oneitis sets you up for disappointment. When you’re fixated on another person and convince yourself that things will work out between you, it’s hard to see that your obsession is based on illusion. In reality, you may not know that person as well as you think, and if you do get closer and find out they aren’t who you thought they were, that illusion comes crashing down. [6] X Research source This can result in some serious disappointment, which only makes getting back into the dating pool harder."

[7] X Trustworthy Source HealthyChildren.org Health information from the American Academy of Pediatrics. Go to source With oneitis, you’re placing all your respect with another person, often one that you hardly know. It becomes harder to see that you’re an independent and capable person who doesn’t necessarily need someone else to be “whole.” Similarly, oneitis also hurts your chances at a real relationship. When you’re too distracted to work on boosting your own confidence, you’re not not giving yourself the tools you need to form a genuine connection, like self-esteem, conversation skills, or a positive personality."

      "title": "Oneitis creates unrealistic expectations for “the one.”",
      "content": "Oneitis creates unrealistic expectations for “the one.” Oneitis often leads you to make a sort of shopping list for your hypothetical soulmate. They have to be attractive, funny, smart, agree with you all the time, treat you as their number-one priority, etc. But idealizing “the one” this way only sets up unrealistic expectations that nobody is ever going to meet. Instead, you’ll find yourself constantly analyzing your romantic partners, and rejecting people who might be genuinely good for you when they don’t meet that impossibly high bar.

Idolizing your partner can lead to intense jealousy, a need for constant contact, emotional dependence, violating their personal boundaries, and other burdens on your relationship. [9] X Research source These all work to sabotage your bond with the person you love, even when you genuinely do love them. It’s important to take a step back every once in a while and ask yourself if you have emotional dependency . It might be time to reevaluate what you need from your relationship"

But when you jump right to “this is the only person for me,” you skip right to the end result without putting in the work. A healthy, mutual, long-term relationship takes effort, time, and growth. [11] X Research source People are more likely to become “the one” over time, as you learn about them, get to know them, and form a life together, than they are to be “the one” right off the bat. At the start, your feelings are probably infatuation, not love. But you might turn infatuation into love by spending more time with that person and accepting them for who they are, not who you want them to be."

[12] X Research source It’s often a sign that you place more value on the relationship, or potential relationship, than they do. You may think of them as a real catch, but they’re not interested in taking the bait. It may be time to reconsider your dynamic. Take a look at your text conversation, if you have one. Is it mostly your own chat bubbles, with only a few of their peppering the convo? If so, that’s a strong sign the relationship is one-sided."

It’s tough to hear, but it could be that you’ve placed greater value on the relationship than they have. You see them as a priority, but that priority might be unrequited.

If the object of your romantic fantasies is already in the middle of their own romance, that’s a clear sign of unrequited love and, yes, oneitis. [14] X Research source It’s unfair to both of you to root for the end of that relationship. If they’re already happy, what’s the point in making yourself unhappy by wishing for them to be unhappy in their current relationship? Take it from us, it’ll only result in more heartache. Similarly, it might be oneitis if you continue to obsess over them after they’ve turned you down. It hurts, but it’s important to handle rejection in a more healthy manner, for your own well-being."

Rather than enjoying the relationship, you might be feeling possessive, suspicious, sensitive, or even a little controlling. [15] X Research source You’re in the relationship and still hoping they’re “the one,” but your own emotions aren’t reflecting that belief. If they really were “the one,” chances are you’d be much more content than you are now. Ask yourself: Do you enjoy spending time with them? Are you more often glad to be with them than unsatisfied, or even worried about the relationship? Does thinking about them prompt more negative feelings than positive?"

      "content": "You cling to the idea of romance rather than romance itself. Often, oneitis has less to do with a specific person and more to do with the mere idea of romance. You might be waiting for the perfect partner to come and make everything in your life right. [16] X Research source It doesn’t even really matter who, but as soon as the idea that this next person is “the one” plants itself, the oneitis sets in. This way, you could be bouncing from romantic interest to romantic interest, never actually finding one that sticks."

They might treat you poorly, but you make excuses for the behavior or wave it away as a minor issue. [17] X Research source This blinds you to real problems in your relationship and only serves to make you both more unhappy as you fixate on them rather than finding a healthier and happier relationship. Even if you’re not in a relationship with them, you might find yourself making excuses for why they don’t always seem to be the one. For example, you might think they only give you the cold shoulder because they’re playing hard to get, but maybe they don’t want to be gotten."

      "content": "See other people to expand your romantic experiences. Seeing other people has 2 purposes. First, it shows you all the possibilities you might be neglecting by fixating on a single person who might be unavailable. And second, it puts the power back in your hands. Suddenly, you’re saying, “Actually, there are other possibilities. I don’t need to cling to this one.” As a result, you become more confident, in control, and even more attractive. [18] X Research source Look for a partner on dating apps like Tinder or Bumble, or even just hit a bar or cafe and start a conversation with a stranger.

These can be strangers, friends, or even just family. This helps remind you that your other social bonds are just as important as the romantic bond that you’re chasing, and dull the intensity of your feelings. It also helps you build a social safety net that you can fall back on when you do have romantic trouble.

You might not actually want that person in particular, but what they can offer you. You might simply want affection or intimacy, and have decided that this person is the only one who can give it to you, even if that’s not true. [20] X Research source Cut down on your communication with “the one” and ask yourself: Do you actually like them as a person? Do they have something that nobody else (including yourself) could give you? Do you want to be in a relationship with them, or do you just want a relationship in general?"

[21] X Research source Expanding your horizons shows you that there’s more to life than romance, and your own personal experience can be just as meaningful and rewarding as meeting “the one.” Find a new hobby to lose yourself in, or join a special interest club like a book club, fan club, or club sports to meet new people while having a good time."

You might ask your partner to be more proactive and plan a date night, or to be more proactive with their affection. If the dynamic doesn’t balance, it might be time to consider ending the relationship. For example, you might say, “Lately I feel like I’m putting more effort into the relationship than usual.

For example, you might decide not to move forward with a relationship if they don’t make plans, or you might delete their number altogether if texting them causes you grief. Also, show your respect by respecting other people’s boundaries.

Instead, spend more time with yourself and the people around you, who already contribute to your life, rather than an idealized vision of someone. Get off of social media by logging out of your accounts or uninstalling social media apps from your phone. After a week, check in on yourself and ask yourself if you’re feeling better.
