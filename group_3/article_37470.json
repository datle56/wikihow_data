      "content": "Understand the glucose-glycogen cycle. The carbohydrates in your diet are broken down to create glucose. Dietary carbohydrates provide the basic components needed to keep glucose in your blood so you have enough energy for your daily routines. [1] X Research source When your body senses that you have extra glucose, it converts the glucose to glycogen by a process called glycogenesis. The glycogen is stored in muscle and liver tissue. [2] X Research source As your blood glucose levels begin to run low, your body converts the glycogen back to glucose by a process called glycolysis. [3] X Research source Exercise can deplete the glucose in your blood more quickly, causing your body to pull on the reserved glycogen. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Know what happens during anaerobic and aerobic exercise. Anaerobic exercise involves short bursts of activity, such as weightlifting and muscle development and training. Aerobic exercise involves longer episodes of sustained activity that cause your heart and lungs to work harder. During anaerobic exercise, your body uses the glycogen stored in the muscle tissue. This causes you to reach a point of muscle exhaustion when you do several sets of repetitive muscle training exercises. Aerobic exercise utilizes the glycogen stored in your liver. Prolonged aerobic exercise, like marathon running, causes you to reach a point where those stores are depleted. When that happens, you may not have enough glucose in your blood to properly fuel your brain. This can result in symptoms consistent with hypoglycemia, including fatigue, poor coordination, feeling dizzy, and problems with concentration. [5] X Research source"

Your body has a two hour window immediately following exercise during which it more effectively restores your glycogen. [6] X Research source Opt for a healthy snack like a protein shake with almond butter, broccoli sprouts, and 1/4 of an avocado. This contains protein, fat, and carbohydrates, which will help restore your depleted glycogen. [7] X Expert Source Kristi Acuna Holistic Nutritionist Expert Interview. 17 September 2020. Simple carbohydrates include foods and beverages that are easily broken down by your body, [8] X Research source such as fruits, milk, chocolate milk, and vegetables. Foods prepared with refined sugars are also sources of simple carbohydrates, such as cakes and candies, however these sources lack nutritional value. [9] X Research source Research suggests that consuming 50 grams of carbohydrates every two hours increases the rate of restoring the depleted glycogen stores. This method increased the rate of replacement from an average of 2% per hour, to 5% per hour. [10] X Research source"

      "content": "Prepare for an endurance event. Athletes work to develop higher levels of endurance in order to compete in events like marathons, triathlons, cross country skiing, and distance swimming events. They also learn to manipulate their own glycogen stores to compete more effectively. [13] X Research source Hydration for an endurance event begins about 48 hours before the big day. Keep a container filled with water on you constantly for the days leading up to your endurance event. Drink as much as you can during those two days. Begin your high-carbohydrate eating two days before the event. Try to select high-carbohydrate foods that also have nutritional value. Examples include whole grains, brown rice, sweet potatoes, and whole grain pasta. Include fruits, vegetables, and lean protein in your meals. Avoid alcohol and processed foods."

      "content": "Consider carbohydrate loading . Carbo loading methods are used by athletes that participate in endurance events, or events that last longer than 90 minutes. Carbo loading involves timing and selection of foods high in carbohydrate content to help expand the glycogen stores beyond their average levels. [14] X Research source Completely depleting the glycogen stores prior to the event, then loading with carbohydrates, works to expand the glycogen storage capacity even further. This allows the athlete to push harder and further, and hopefully improve his performance during the event. [15] X Research source The most traditional method for carbohydrate loading starts about a week before the event. Change your regular diet to include about 55% of your total calories as carbohydrates, with protein and fat added in as the remainder. This depletes your carbohydrate stores. [16] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Three days prior to the event, adjust your carbohydrate intake to reach 70% of your daily calories. Decrease your intake of fat, and reduce your level of training.

Drinking sports beverages during an athletic event can help by providing a continued source of carbohydrates to your system, plus the added caffeine, available in some products, helps to improve endurance. Sports drinks contain sodium and potassium to maintain your electrolyte balance. Recommendations for sports beverages consumed during long periods of exercise include products that have from 4% to 8% carbohydrate content, 20 to 30 mEq/L of sodium, and 2 to 5 mEq/L of potassium."

      "content": "Consider the function of insulin and glucagon. Insulin and glucagon are hormones made by the pancreas. Insulin works to move glucose into the cells of the body for energy, remove excess glucose from the blood stream, and convert the excess glucose to glycogen. Glycogen is stored in muscle and liver tissue for later use, when more glucose is needed in the blood."

The glucose pulled from the glycogen stores is needed to provide the energy we need to function each day."

      "content": "Be familiar with changes caused by diabetes. In people that have diabetes, the pancreas does not function normally, therefore hormones like insulin and glucagon are not adequately produced or released in the body. Inadequate levels of insulin and glucagon means that the glucose in the blood is not properly pulled into the cells of tissues to be used as energy, the excess glucose in the blood is not adequately removed to be stored as glycogen, and what is stored as glycogen cannot be pulled back into the blood when it is needed for energy. The ability to utilize glucose in the blood, store it as glycogen, and then access it again, is impaired. Therefore, diabetics are at greater risk of developing hypoglycemia."

Medications work to provide the balance needed to help the body properly perform both glycogenesis and glycolysis. While the available medications are saving lives every day, they are not perfect. Patients with diabetes are at risk of developing hypoglycemic events, even by simple changes in their daily routine. In some cases, the hypoglycemic events can be severe and even life-threatening."

      "content": "Stick to your eating and exercise regimens. Even the smallest change can cause unwanted results. Talk to your doctor before making any changes in your food choices and exercise routine. If you are diabetic, altering the foods you eat, the amount of foods and beverages you consume, and changes in your level of activity, can result in complications. For example, exercising, which is an important part of diabetic health, can create problems. During exercise, more energy, or glucose, is needed, so your body will try to pull from your glycogen stores. Impaired glucagon functioning causes less than adequate amounts of glycogen to be pulled from the stores in muscle and liver tissue. This can mean a delayed, and possibly severe, episode of hypoglycemia. Even several hours after exercise, the body will continue to work to restore the glycogen used during exercise. The body will pull the glucose from the blood supply, triggering a hypoglycemic event. [21] X Research source"

      "content": "Treat an episode of hypoglycemia. Hypoglycemia comes on fairly quickly in someone that is diabetic. Any signs of dizziness, fatigue, confusion, difficulty comprehending a statement, and having trouble responding, are warning signs. The initial steps to treating a mild hypoglycemic episode involve consuming glucose or simple carbohydrates. Help the diabetic person to consume 15 to 20 grams of glucose, as gel or tablets, or as simple carbohydrates. Some food items that can be used include raisins, orange juice, sodas with sugar, honey, and jellybeans. As the blood sugar returns to normal, and enough glucose is getting to the brain, the person will become more alert. Continue to provide foods and beverages until the person recovers. If there is ever any question about what to do, call 911."
