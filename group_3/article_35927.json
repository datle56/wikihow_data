      "content": "Night hangs usually mean one thing—and that’s a booty call. If you regularly get texts after 11 pm asking to hang out, that’s a relationship red flag. It could mean that your boyfriend only wants to get in your pants, and he knows that night-time is the time to do it. [1] X Research source This is especially true if he only ever texts you things like, “You up?”"

      "content": "People introduce partners to their loved ones when they’re getting serious. If you’ve never hung out with your boyfriend’s friends or met his family members, that’s a red flag. It could mean that he only wants you for the physical aspect of your relationship, and he’s not really planning on sticking around long-term. [2] X Research source Keep in mind that everyone takes relationships at their own pace. If your boyfriend hasn’t introduced you to anyone in his life yet, feel free to ask him why. He might just feel nervous or anxious about getting more serious with you."

      "title": "Healthy partners enjoy having conversations about lots of things.",
      "content": "Healthy partners enjoy having conversations about lots of things. Does your boyfriend engage in conversations with you, or does he brush you off every time you try to chat with him? Unfortunately, if he’s not super interested in talking to you, there’s a chance that he’s only in this relationship for your body. [3] X Research source He might also try to steer every conversation toward something sexual, or only talk about how hot/sexy you look today, or how an outfit looks on you. Reader Poll: We asked 125 wikiHow readers how they like to show love to their partner, and 50% of them said through physical affection, like hugs and kisses. [Take Poll] However, it’s also important to connect emotionally through conversations and quality time."

      "content": "A good partner is interested in knowing you on a deeper level. Have you ever talked about your hopes, dreams, or fears? In healthy relationships, partners will get to know each other more by asking deep questions about their past and their goals for the future. If your boyfriend keeps things pretty shallow and hasn’t ever done a deep dive into your life, it could mean that he’s using you for your body. [4] X Research source Try starting a conversation with him and asking him questions first. If he doesn’t reciprocate or the conversation dies out, that’s a red flag."

      "content": "Couples usually stay in contact via text or phone calls. You might have trouble getting ahold of your boyfriend on days you don’t see him, or he might leave you on read for hours (or days). If so, it could be a sign that he only wants you for your body—but only on his terms, and when it fits into his schedule. [5] X Research source It could also be that your boyfriend is super busy, or that he’s bad at texting. However, it’s worth talking to him about it to see what’s up, because ghosting you for days on end isn’t right."

      "title": "You might notice that he’s never said anything about your personality.",
      "content": "You might notice that he’s never said anything about your personality. This most likely means that he’s not interested in getting to know the real you—he knows everything that he needs to know, which is that you’re hot/sexy. If your boyfriend only ever calls out physical aspects, he might just be using you. For example, if he never cares about how kind you are, and only says things like, \"You look like a hot mess right now.\" [6] X Research source These compliments are flattering, but things like, “You’re hot,” and “You look so good today” get old after a while. In most relationships, people progress past complimenting just their partner’s looks, and also call out things they like about their personality, like, \"You are so sweet.\""

      "content": "Staying at home usually means that he wants to get physical with you. If he only likes you for your body, you might only go over to his place to Netflix and chill. In relationships (especially new ones), partners usually take each other out to eat or do fun things together. Unfortunately, if your boyfriend never wants to leave the house with you, he might only be in it for the sex. [7] X Research source Feel free to ask your boyfriend out on dates, too! If he’s a little inexperienced in the relationship department, he might not realize that that’s something you want to do."

      "content": "He might insist that your relationship is just casual. It’s totally fine if that’s what you’re looking for, but usually, a casual relationship indicates that he’s mainly in it to hook up with you. If you’ve had the “what are we” conversation and he can’t really tell you, it might be time to move on. [8] X Research source You deserve to be with someone who wants to be with you 100%. If it’s been a little while and he can’t decide, move on and find someone else."

      "content": "In healthy relationships, you’re allowed to say no to physical contact. Maybe you’re too tired one night, or you’re really just not feeling it. If your boyfriend pouts or gets mad at you because you don’t want to get physical, that’s a huge red flag. No one should ever pressure you to have sex when you don’t want to, especially someone you’re in a relationship with. [9] X Trustworthy Source National Domestic Violence Hotline Organization providing lifesaving tools, support, and resources for victims and survivors of domestic abuse Go to source Convincing you to have sex after you’ve said no is called “sexual coercion,” and it’s a form of sexual assault. If this has happened with your boyfriend before, you should definitely break things off."

      "content": "He might ask you repeatedly to do sexual acts you aren’t comfortable with. A healthy partner will take “no” for an answer no matter what. If your boyfriend keeps bringing things up that he knows you aren’t down for, that’s a bad sign. [10] X Trustworthy Source National Domestic Violence Hotline Organization providing lifesaving tools, support, and resources for victims and survivors of domestic abuse Go to source Remember, you’re allowed to say no to anything you don’t want to do with him.

      "content": "Flirting shows that he doesn't really respect you or your relationship. You might catch him checking other people out or even flirting with them while you’re around. Not only is this rude to you, but it also shows that he’s preoccupied with how attractive other people are. [11] X Research source Attraction to others doesn’t disappear when you get into a relationship, but it’s just polite not to flaunt it in front of your partner. You deserve to be in a relationship where you feel respected, not one that makes you uncomfortable."
