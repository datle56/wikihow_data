Clear out any trash or clutter around you, especially on the floor near the pedals. [3] X Research source Finally, hang a car diffuser with essential oils in the car to ease anxiety. Do a quick rundown of all the buttons and levers in the car. Make sure you know what each one does and how to use them before you start driving."

      "content": "Be prepared for anything before you start driving on your own! Have your parent (or the car owner) show you where to find the vehicle registration and insurance cards and a list of phone numbers, including roadside assistance and emergency contacts. That way, you'll know what to do if you encounter trouble on the road.

Keep track of streets and intersections, so you know which signs to look for and won't have to worry about missing any of your exits or turns.

      "content": "Learn your way around a car with no extra pressure. You won't have to worry about traffic laws and other drivers in a parking lot. Practice basic maneuvers like starting, stopping, turning, and signaling in a quiet, safe place. Parking lots also allow new drivers to practice driving at different speeds since there is more room to cruise around than a driveway.

For example, many teens worry about parallel parking, but you can learn how to parallel park safely in an empty lot."

      "content": "Pick a quiet area with low traffic to drive on roads comfortably. Once you've mastered parking lots, the next step is driving in residential or rural areas with fewer cars and having people walking around. This allows you to get comfortable driving on an actual road without worrying about causing an accident. Use the practice to apply road rules like signaling to other drivers and looking for speed limits. [8] X Research source Practicing on a quiet road first means there is less pressure on you to get all the rules of the road right the first time around, and you won't have to worry about slowing down other drivers behind you."

      "content": "Get comfortable with different roads and speed limits. Once you feel comfortable driving on low-stress roads near your house, slowly get out of your comfort zone. You might start by driving on the main road with a parent. Then, try driving on that same road without a parent (if you have your license). Eventually, start gradually working up to higher stress situations, like driving on the highway or busier streets with a parent. [9] X Research source Try challenging yourself with new routes as your confidence grows. Take a different route to school, or drive with your parent to a different grocery store than you usually visit. Eventually, you may transition to driving alone and tackling more demanding situations such as peak traffic."

Before traveling long distances in bad weather, take advantage of the rain or snow to practice for shorter distances, such as driving around your neighborhood. [10] X Research source Practice night driving in safer areas (such as a slow road or parking lot) to help you get used to those new conditions as well. Rain, ice, and packed snow cause roads to be slippery, so learn to slow your speed and navigate roads safely. Night driving also requires you to pay extra attention to how you use your headlights and look more carefully for pedestrians, bicyclists, and other drivers. Remember, don't rush the process. While getting out of your comfort zone is necessary to overcome your driving anxiety, avoid entering situations that you're unprepared for.

[13] X Research source While listening to music can be calming, it's better to drive in silence until you feel comfortable on the road, so you pay more attention to your surroundings and other cars. Remember: your focus should be on the road at all times! Make sure you get between 8 to 10 hours of sleep each night! A good night's sleep will improve your focus; conversely, it'll be hard to concentrate if you're sleepy."

Driving instructors give you in-depth lessons and help you identify and correct bad driving habits in a safe environment. You'll improve your skill with the help of a professional—and odds are their presence will make you feel more secure as you drive. Even if you know most of the basics of driving, an instructor can train you in areas that might be causing the most anxiety, like parallel parking or merging.
