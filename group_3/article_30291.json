      "content": "Fold the paper in half, then open it up and fold it in half the other way. Orient a square piece of origami paper so a corner points towards you. Fold the bottom corner up to the top corner and flatten it. Then, unfold it and repeat the fold with the remaining corners. [1] X Research source If your paper has a white side and a colored side, place the white side face down. It will help you keep track of the folds you need to make. Bigger pieces of paper are easier to work with. Try using an oversized sheet of origami paper for your first elephant."

      "title": "Bring the bottom corner to the center of the paper.",
      "content": "Bring the bottom corner to the center of the paper. Make sure the paper is completely unfolded. After making the fold, flatten the paper. Rotate the sheet 90 degrees so the folded edge is on the right. [2] X Research source Leave the paper folded after rotating it."

      "title": "Pinch the top corner towards the right edge.",
      "content": "Pinch the top corner towards the right edge. Bring the top corner over to the right edge of the paper. Rest the corner about ⅔ of the way up the fold. Make sure the edges of the paper are aligned. Then, along the center of the paper, pinch the new fold lightly to leave a little mark. Open the paper all the way back up when you’re done. [3] X Research source Avoid creasing the paper while you make this fold."

    {
      "title": "Bring the lower corner to the pinch mark, then fold the remaining corners.",
      "content": "Bring the lower corner to the pinch mark, then fold the remaining corners. Fold the corner up, then crease the paper completely. Unfold the paper again when you’re done. Finish by folding the remaining corners at the same time, pressing them flat to make full creases, before opening the paper back up again. [4] X Research source If you did all the folds correctly, you will see a square in the center of the paper. The bottom part of the square will have 2 fold lines. The diagonal pinch mark will be below the square’s upper edge."

      "title": "Move the top and bottom corners in to create small marks.",
      "content": "Move the top and bottom corners in to create small marks. Move the corner up to the second horizontal crease at the bottom of the square. Pinch the center to leave a little mark, then unfold the paper. Next, bring the opposite corner down to the pinch mark, then make another pinch mark in the center. Unfold the paper when you’re done. [5] X Research source Avoid creasing the paper when performing these folds. When you’re done, the paper will have a little mark near its center."

      "content": "Fold the left and right corners to the creases on the opposite side. Start with the right corner. Bring it towards the left corner, aligning it with the left edge of the square formed by the creases. Flatten the crease, unfold the paper, and then repeat the fold with the left corner. [6] X Research source Make sure both sides of the paper look identical. The creases are guidelines for the next folds. After finishing them, you can begin folding the paper into the shape of an elephant."

Lift the paper up and fold it down along that crease to form a little ridge. Then, push the fold up and back over the paper. Fold the paper along the second crease until the ridge is against the paper and you can flatten the crease. [7] X Research source This fold is called a mountain fold. The 2 creases were made with valley folds. Valley folds fold inwards, forming valleys, while mountain folds are the opposite."

Fold the exposed edge to the right of the corner about halfway up the triangle. Finish this part by undoing the last fold and repeating it with the edge to the left of the corner. [9] X Research source Use the crease on the right as a guideline when folding the corner tip back up. The second fold needs to be perpendicular to it. Make sure the second fold looks horizontal and parallel to the upper edge of the page when you’re done."

By pinching the sides at the creases from the earlier folds, the corner will form a point. Pinch the point together so it retains its shape, then fold it to the left to flatten it. [10] X Research source The rabbit ear will rise up off the page until you flatten it."

It will leave you with a left and right side. Set the paper down on the table again and rotate it so the small, triangular flap points up. [11] X Research source When this part is done correctly, the small, triangular flap will be on the right side of the paper. A larger, folded triangle will be on the left side."

Grasp the bottom edge of the paper, leaving behind the half of paper underneath it. Fold it up along the crease line but don’t flatten it yet. Instead, fold it down and to the left. [14] X Research source When this fold is done correctly, the paper flap will form a sort of tube. It will align with the diagonal edge of the paper beneath it. As you move the bottom edge up, you will see a small flap in the center of the page. Press it down so you can fold the paper to the left evenly."

Orient it so the large flap is on the right. Pick up the flap and fold it over onto the rectangle. Then, open it back up and pick up the paper. Put your finger inside the flap to stand it up and open it. Finally, push down on it to collapse it over the edge of the rectangle. [17] X Research source You will notice a piece of paper inside the flap. Place your finger over that piece so you can reach the center of the flap.

Start by holding the left flap up, then fold the bottom part of the paper up to the top. Insert your finger in the top flap, stand it up, and collapse it over the center of the square.

Then, pull the flap down towards the bottom edge of the paper. [23] X Research source When this part is done correctly, the flap will point down past the bottom edge of the page.
