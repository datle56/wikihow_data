      "title": "Choose the right lip balm.",
      "content": "Choose the right lip balm. Not all lip balms are created equal. When selecting a product to apply to your lips, make sure you choose a product with the proper ingredients to heal your lips. Look for ingredients like cocoa butter, Vitamins A and E, petrolatum, and dimethicone. Products without these ingredients might not do much to heal lips and could even make symptoms worse. Balms that include alpha-hydroxy acid can soothe and exfoliate chapped lips. This is an especially good ingredient to look for if you want something you can apply as a rub. Apply by gently adding the products to the lips, brushing the lips with a toothbrush to remove flakes, and then wiping off the balm. Petroleum and beeswax are also good ingredients to look for when seeking out lip balm. Responses to such products tend to vary from person-to-person, however, so you might have to try a few different products before you find one that works for you.

      "content": "Try sunscreen. Sunscreen can help protect lips that are already dried and cracked from further damage outside. [2] X Expert Source Margareth Pierre-Louis, MD Board Certified Dermatologist Expert Interview. 15 May 2020. Look for a sunscreen of SPF 30 or higher for optimal protection. You should be able to find such a product in most drugstores and supermarkets. Always apply a lip balm as protection underneath sunscreen. Apply sunscreen that has broad spectrum cover for UVA and UVB that is water resistant."

      "title": "Try home remedies.",
      "content": "Try home remedies. If you're looking for a more natural route, there are a variety of home remedies you can try that may improve your cracked, dry lips. Natural oils, like coconut oil and mustard oil, can moisturize dry lips. Natural oils tend to work best when cracked lips are the result of poor weather conditions. Cucumbers can cool and soothe lips. Simply eating cucumber, and applying the juices to the lips, can help. Aloe vera, which can be purchased in cream or gel form from most drug stores, is a great option for cracked lips. You can also purchase an aloe vera plant and apply the juice from the leaves to your lips. Be aware that the taste of aloe vera is sometimes unpleasant. Make sure not to get any in your mouth while applying it to your lips. Milk cream softens skin throughout the body, including the lips. Apply cream to the lips and leave on for 10 minutes. Rub the cream away from the lips with a cotton ball dipped in lukewarm water. Repeat as needed until lips heal."

      "content": "Ask your doctor about an antibiotic or antifungal cream. If your cracked lips are severe and do not improve with over-the-counter treatments, you might need to see a doctor about prescription medication. If your lips become inflamed and feel sore, talk to your doctor. Inflammation is usually benign and the result of mild irritation, but it can also be a sign of a bacterial infection. [3] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source Antifungal and antibiotic creams, such as hydrocortisone creams, can be used to treat cracked lips in the event of an infection. Your doctor will prescribe you a cream if she thinks it is necessary. Always ask a doctor about potential side effects and proper use before starting a new medication. [4] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source Steroid creams are not designed for long-term use, as this can cause thinning of the skin, discoloration, and other adverse side effects.

      "content": "Do not bite or lick your lips. Cracked, dry lips can be caused or exasperated by lip biting and licking. These behaviors should be avoided while you wait for your lips to heal. Licking one's lips seems like a good idea as it can temporarily relieve dryness and provide some relief; however, saliva evaporates quickly, which results in your lips becoming drier after licking. You also might be tempted to lick if you use flavored lip balm, so avoid this if it causes temptation. Lip biting may be a response to anxiety. Oftentimes, people bite their lip as a largely unconscious tic in response to anxiety-inducing situations. When you find yourself in a situation that makes you nervous, pay close attention to your habits. Are you biting your lips? If so, you might want to make an appointment with a psychiatrist or therapist to talk about how to better cope with anxiety. This can help prevent cracked lips in the long-term.

      "title": "Limit your exposure to allergens until lips are healed.",
      "content": "Limit your exposure to allergens until lips are healed. Cracked lips are sometimes an allergic response in and of themselves but can also be a side-effect of allergic responses like congestion. Some allergens, like pollen in the air, cause congestion. This leads to mouth-breathing, which can dry out and crack lips. If you're prone to allergies at certain times of the year, try to stay inside when possible and invest in over-the-counter allergy meds that can reduce symptoms. [7] X Research source Your cracked lips themselves might be an allergic response. If you've recently started using a new shampoo, conditioner, lip balm, lipstick, or toothpaste, such products could be irritating your mouth. If you have just started using a new product, try ceasing use for a week and see if symptoms improve. If they do, you could very well have an allergy to that product. In addition, a common cause of cracked lips is the chronic use of lip balm. Be careful not to overuse lip balm or can develop a condition call cheilosis. Even if you do not believe a lipstick or lip balm is causing your cracked lips, it's probably a good idea to discontinue use until your lips are healed. Anything you apply to your lips while they're cracked or dry can cause irritation and worsen or prolong symptoms."

      "content": "Do not pick your lips until they heal. If your lips are really bothering you, you might want to pick at them to try and remove dead skin flakes. While this might seem like a good way to quicken the healing process, it actually makes it worse. [8] X Expert Source Margareth Pierre-Louis, MD Board Certified Dermatologist Expert Interview. 15 May 2020. Picking at lips causes them to bleed and scab, prolonging the healing process. If you're tempted to pick, you could try trimming down your nails or wearing band-aids around your fingertips to prevent absent-minded picking."

      "content": "Stay hydrated. Oftentimes, cracked lips are a response to dehydration. Staying hydrated can protect cracked lips, especially during dry winter months. Women should aim to get nine 8-oz glasses (2.2 liters) of fluid each day and men should aim for 13 glasses (3 liters) daily. If your home is dry, you could invest in a humidifier to keep the air in your home moisturized."

      "content": "Protect your lips under certain weather conditions. During fall months, when the weather gets colder and drier, you should strive to protect your lips before they become cracked and dry. Always apply a lip balm with the appropriate ingredients before going out in cold weather. Lip balms and waxes can shield your lips from harsh weather by forming a protective barrier. Even in the fall and winter, apply sunscreen. UVB rays are present in midday even during colder months and your lips need to be protected from the sun."

      "content": "Get more flaxseed oil. Flaxseed oil boasts a number of positive health benefits and incorporating the heart-healthy oil into your diet can prevent cracked and dry lips. Flaxseed oil can be applied directly on your lips, and this can be a good idea if you're lips are already chapped and incorporating the oil into your everyday dietary routine can stop cracked lips before they happen. [9] X Research source Flaxseed oil can be added to smoothies, oatmeal, dips, dressings, and sauces. If it has contact with your mouth on a daily basis, it can help strengthen your lips and protect them against cracking and drying. Flaxseed oil does go bad quickly, so pay close attention to the expiration date. Buy it in small amounts so you're able to use it before it expires."
