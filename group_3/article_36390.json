      "content": "Soak up the oil with a paper towel. Cleaning specialist Jon Gholian recommends that you address stains quickly. He says, “Your best bet is to wash immediately after usage before the stain gets too saturated into the wood.” Blot the stain with paper towels, newspaper, or blotting paper , pressing the paper firmly until you’re sure you have soaked up the oil. [1] X Research source Wear rubber gloves throughout this project to avoid any skin irritation, especially if you have sensitive skin."

      "content": "Mix up a mild detergent solution in a bowl. Place some warm water in a bowl and add some mild detergent . Use your hands to mix the solution and create soap suds. The solution should be at least 2 parts water to one part soap. If you need more suds, add another small squirt of soap and remix. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Clean the oily area with your solution.",
      "content": "Clean the oily area with your solution. Place some of the soap suds onto the stained area with a clean cloth and rub onto the affected area. Be gentle enough to avoid scratching the wood, but firm enough to work the suds into the wood grain. To treat deeper or more stubborn stains, scrub the soapsuds in with a soft brush . House cleaning professional Guy Peters advises that you “always use a cotton ball or soft rag to clean your wood surface.” Avoid harsher abrasives like steel brushes, as they may scratch your wooden surface."

      "title": "Rinse the wood with clean water.",
      "content": "Rinse the wood with clean water. Once you have finished cleaning, rinse the area with clean water, or wipe it down with a clean damp cloth. This will remove any remaining oily residue or suds. However, Gholian urges not to let the wood soak in water. He says, “Prolonged exposure to water will damage the wood. Wash and allow to air dry evenly.”"

    {
      "title": "Pat the wood dry with a clean cloth or towel.",
      "content": "Pat the wood dry with a clean cloth or towel. Drying the wood removes moisture so you are better able to determine if the stain has been removed. Gholian says to “let the spot dry. Then, smooth the raised grain with fine sandpaper.” Allow the wood to air dry if it is still not completely dry. Once the wood is completely dry, check to see if the stain is still there. If still evident, you’ll need to apply further treatment."

      "title": "Apply mineral spirits to the stain.",
      "content": "Apply mineral spirits to the stain. Mineral spirits are best reserved to treat old, stubborn stains. Dampen one corner of a clean cloth or cotton ball with some mineral spirits , which are solvents used for cleaning, painting, and varnishing, commonly available at hardware stores and online. Gholian says to rub firmly in a circular motion over the stained area in small sections at a time, being careful not to saturate the wood. If the stain is light, the mineral spirits should clear the stain away. [3] X Research source Mineral spirits are very strong and can cause skin irritation, so it’s best to work in a well-ventilated area, according to Peters. Slip on a pair of rubber gloves for extra safety. If the stain is particularly stubborn, you may need to repeat this step a few times."

      "title": "Polish the wood with a soft cloth.",
      "content": "Polish the wood with a soft cloth. Once the surface is dry and the stain has been removed, it’s a good idea to polish the wood to restore its luster. Apply wood polish sparingly with a soft cloth. Rub in a circular motion until all the polish is absorbed by the wood. [5] X Research source Cleaning specialist Eduardo Peralta says, “Make sure the towel is slightly damp and apply the first finish against the wood grain. Evenly coat any micro-porous cracks in the wood.” He adds, “After evenly coating all areas, let it dry for a few hours to a day."

      "content": "Apply a small amount of turpentine to the corner of a white cloth. Turpentine is a common solvent that can be useful for cleaning oily buildup on surfaces. [6] X Research source This method will work on all kinds of wood furniture or surfaces that have built-up hand oils and dirt, such as cabinets, doors, and door frames. Avoid using abrasives like hard brushes or baking soda, as they can damage the finish of the furniture."

      "content": "Clean the area with a damp cloth. Giving the furniture a final wipe with a clean, damp cloth will remove any remaining turpentine or oily residue from your wooden furniture. Gholian encourages you to persevere, stating, “If one application doesn't work, repeat the procedure.”"

      "title": "Use baking soda on outdoor wooden furniture.",
      "content": "Use baking soda on outdoor wooden furniture. This household staple has tons of absorbent properties, making it an excellent cleaner. Use it to soak up the oil on your outdoor dining table by blotting the oil up first. Then, make a thick paste consisting of baking soda and water. It’s best to test the strength of the paste on a tiny area of the wood to make sure it’s not too abrasive. Next, lather the paste onto the stain and leave it alone for about 30 minutes. [8] X Research source Using a damp cloth, clean the area and pat it dry. For extra stubborn stains, add a small amount of dish soap to the mixture."

      "content": "Apply cornstarch to indoor wooden furniture. Generously spread the cornstarch all over the stain, allowing it to soak up the oil overnight. The next day, vacuum up the cornstarch and note if progress has been made. If the oil stain is gone, wipe it clean and pat it dry. If the stain is still visible, rinse and repeat."

      "title": "Try mayonnaise for small stains.",
      "content": "Try mayonnaise for small stains. If the stain consists of only a small spot, mayonnaise may be the hero you never saw coming. Using mayonnaise to remove oil works by displacing the moisture of the original oil and “masking” the stain in a way. Try this method out by dousing the stain with a healthy heaping of mayo, and allowing it to sit for about an hour. Wipe the area clean and rinse with warm soapy water. [9] X Research source"

      "title": "Treat the stains as quickly as possible and use a soapy solution.",
      "content": "Treat the stains as quickly as possible and use a soapy solution. If it’s a fresh spillage, blot out the oil with a paper towel. Then, clean the area with a sudsy solution of detergent and water. Rinse the wood with water and pat dry or let air dry. Do not let the water soak as it can warp or otherwise damage the wood. Once dry, you can apply wood polish to a cloth and rub in a circular motion. You can use mineral spirits for more stubborn stains and turpentine for body oil residue found on doorknobs, furniture, and the like. Household items, like baking soda, cornstarch, and mayonnaise, can also help remove oil stains."
