      "content": "Sit in the front of the classroom to maintain your focus. It’s cliché, but sitting in the front of the class really does make a world of difference. If you have open seating, just start showing up a little early and grabbing a seat in the front row. If you don’t, ask your teacher to be reseated near the front. It will be much easier to focus if there isn’t anything interrupting your view of the teacher and whiteboard. [1] X Expert Source Daron Cam Math Tutor Expert Interview. 29 May 2020. It’s easy to get lost in math if you lose track of what’s going on. Sitting near the front will make it easier to track what’s going on as your teacher explains how to do a new type of problem. If there are any unruly students in your class, sitting up front will also keep you from getting roped into their shenanigans. Try to sit at an angle so you aren’t looking directly at the clock. If the clock is staring you right in the face, you may end up obsessing over class getting out instead of focusing on the lesson."

      "title": "Listen actively to your teacher.",
      "content": "Listen actively to your teacher. You won’t keep up in class if you aren’t listening to the teacher. If you aren’t writing something down, keep your eyes on the teacher while they’re lecturing. Look at your classmates whenever they ask or answer a question. This will keep you engaged in what’s going on and you’re less likely to fall behind if you aren’t getting distracted or staring off at something in the background. [2] X Research source Looking at your teacher when they speak will also show them that you’re making an effort to stay focused. If it ever gets to the point where you need them to give you the benefit of a doubt on a passing grade, you’re more likely to get the grade if they’ve seen you paying attention."

      "title": "Take notes",
      "content": "Take notes on everything your teacher writes down on the board. You don’t need to write down every single thing that comes out of your teacher’s mouth. In fact, your notes will be a chaotic mess if you do this! Instead, jot down everything your teacher puts on the board. They’re putting it there for a reason, and it will be much easier to review and study if you have all of the essential information in your notes. [3] X Expert Source Daron Cam Math Tutor Expert Interview. 29 May 2020. For each new skill, break the process down into steps in your notes. Then, add bullet points under each step with explanations and examples your teacher provides. It’s much easier to memorize a process or equation if you can turn it into a 4- to 5-step formula. [4] X Expert Source Daron Cam Math Tutor Expert Interview. 29 May 2020. Highlight new vocab terms. There are tons of unique vocabulary terms in math, and highlighting the new words you learn will make them easier to find when you’re flipping through your notebook trying to remember “denominator” or “ratio” means.

      "title": "Raise your hand whenever you feel lost in class.",
      "content": "Raise your hand whenever you feel lost in class. Too many students lose track of what’s going on in math class and don’t speak up, which only makes them more confused as the material gets more complicated! If your teacher says something that kind of goes over your head, raise your hand and ask them to re-explain or provide an example. [6] X Research source For example, you could just say, “Ms. Smith, I’m not really sure how you know which side of the triangle is the hypotenuse. Can you explain that again?” or, “Mr. Bates, I still don’t really understand the difference between rational and irrational numbers. Is there an easier way to figure out which ones are rational?” Even if you do this every class, your teacher won’t get annoyed. Teachers want to know if their students aren’t understanding something."

      "title": "Ask your teacher about getting help outside of class.",
      "content": "Ask your teacher about getting help outside of class. If you’re in high school or grade school, ask your teacher if they offer after-school study sessions or tutoring. If they don’t, ask if you can meet with them during lunch to review homework or do practice problems. This is especially important if you’re a little behind and you’ve struggled with previous math classes. There’s nothing wrong with getting extra help when you need it. In fact, it takes bravery and courage to acknowledge you need help! Unlike a lot of other subjects, math is cumulative. So, if you struggled with pre-algebra in grade school, freshman algebra I might be a tough class for you. Your teacher will be able to spot those foundational gaps and help you fill them in. If you’re a college student, go see your professor during their office hours. Professors don’t get nearly as many visitors as they’d like during office hours, and they’ll be more candid and open to giving you meaningful direction if you chat with them in their office.

      "title": "Review your notes every day to commit the info to memory.",
      "content": "Review your notes every day to commit the info to memory. It’s hard to internalize the information you receive in class if you never open your notebook back up to review your notes. Every day, spend at least 5-10 minutes re-reading your notes for the day. This is one of the best ways to memorize key vocab terms, track what’s going on from class to class, and keep the information fresh in your head. [8] X Research source Commit key formulas to memory, but make sure you know what the variables stand for. If you’ve just learned πr² as the formula for calculating the area of circles, say “pi times the radius squared, which means you multiply it by itself.” This way, you’ll have an easier time comprehending how the formula actually works when you need to use it. This also gives you an opportunity to refresh your memory before you complete any homework that were assigned that day."

      "title": "Give every assignment a shot without looking online for help.",
      "content": "Give every assignment a shot without looking online for help. Even if it chews through an extra 30-45 minutes, try to do your homework without Googling for hints and answers or skipping through your notes looking for the steps. This will challenge you to flex those critical thinking skills and you’re more likely to actually absorb the information if you can arrive at the correct answer on your own. [9] X Research source Try to do your homework on the day it was assigned. You’re more likely to forget about something due next week if you give yourself 4-5 days to forget about it! It’s totally okay to refer to your notes if you can’t figure it out the first time. The goal here isn’t to make things hard, but to try and help you work through each problem on your own. Don’t use one of those homework calculator apps. Yes, you might get the right answer, but those apps are often wrong and the teacher will be able to tell you’re using one if you don’t show your work. You also won’t learn anything!"

      "title": "Look over your work when you get it back to understand your mistakes.",
      "content": "Look over your work when you get it back to understand your mistakes. Whenever your teacher gives you homework, quizzes, or tests back, don’t stuff it in the folder and forget about it. Review your work and see what you got wrong. It may not feel good to see red marks on your paper, but looking at what went wrong will help you identify what you need to fix in the future. [10] X Research source If you look at wrong answers and immediately see what you did wrong, you probably aren’t reading the directions carefully enough. If there were any questions that you thought you got wrong and your suspicions are confirmed, don’t get down about it. It’s actually a good sign. This means that you’re self-aware! Next time, trust your instincts and spend that extra 5 minutes reviewing your answers to the questions you aren’t confident on."

      "content": "Keep your math folder clean and organize your notes. Don’t let old useless papers take up a ton of space in your backpack. Throw out anything that isn’t going to help you complete future assignments. Organize your folder and notes so that you have everything you need in one place. If your notebook is super cluttered or covers multiple subjects, get a new one and only use it for math. Compartmentalizing your work will make it much easier to track things over time. For example, you could keep the left side of your folder for previous work from the unit you’ve been given back to help you study later and leave the right side of the folder for work that you need to turn in. For your notes, you could use the front of your notebook to take daily notes and work your way from the back of the notebook forward to jot down key formulas and definitions."

Show up for any after-school study prep your teacher offers, and use any study halls you have to brush up on your test. Review your notes to make sure you have everything covered for the unit you’re being tested on. If you can, spend extra time every night quizzing yourself and practicing. This way, when it comes time for the exam, you’ll feel prepared and ready. Make lists of the key formulas and definitions you need to know for the exam. Memorize them if you aren’t going to have a key during the test. Test yourself by trying to explain when and why you use each formula. Use the prep materials your teacher gives you. If they pass out a study guide or a practice test, complete the practice problems and review the information. This will give you the best sense for what’s going to be on the exam."

      "content": "Take advantage of any optional assignments and extra credit. If your goal is to pass math, getting all of the free points and practice that you can is one of the best ways to do it. If your teacher offers extra credit regularly, treat it the same way you would a regular homework assignment and force yourself to turn it in. [11] X Research source If your teacher doesn’t offer any extra credit but you aren’t doing as well as you’d like, ask them. Teachers will occasionally throw you some extra credit if you ask."
