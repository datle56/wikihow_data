      "content": "Remove the plastic bumper cover or mask it off with painter's tape. In order to keep from painting other parts of the car, you can either remove and paint the bumper separately or leave the bumper attached and carefully mask off the car body. Removing the bumper works best when you're repairing any scratches or cracks before repainting."

Wet sand down these areas by hand with a spray bottle and some 600-grit sandpaper. Keep a constant layer of water between the sandpaper and bumper by spraying the area you're working on. [3] X Research source Make sure to alternate directions as you sand, moving back and forth as well as up and down, in order to achieve a smooth, flawless finish."

Hold the gun or can about 12 inches (30 cm) away from the surface and use steady, sweeping motions to apply the base coat paint, which should be the same color as the rest of the car. [5] X Research source Overlap each pass by 50% for smooth, even coverage. Let the layer dry for 30 minutes. [6] X Research source To protect yourself from harmful fumes, make sure to wear protective gear such as a face mask and gloves while painting. If you're using a spray can make sure to spray a bit of paint away from the bumper several times to clear out the nozzle. [7] X Research source"

The longer it dries, the longer the paint will hold up and remain durable, so you could even wait up to 24 hours.

Prep solvent removes contaminants from the area, so make sure to only wipe it on in 1 direction instead of back and forth. Wiping in 2 directions will drag contaminants back into the repair area. Once the solvent is dry, sand the area by hand with 80-grit sandpaper. [15] X Research source"

      "content": "Consult an auto repair store to find the right adhesive. The kind of filler you use depends on the type of plastic your bumper is made of, which is indicated on the back of the bumper cover with stamped initials. Call or go in to ask someone at the counter of an auto repair store for some filler product recommendations before purchasing. The plastic types PP (polypropylene), PPO (polyphenylene oxide), and TPE (thermoplastic elastomer) will smear easily when ground or machine-sanded. Plastic types PUR (polyurethane plastic rigid) and TPUR (thermoplastic polyurethane elastomer) will turn to powder when they're ground or sanded down. The brand doesn't necessarily matter, but you should stick with the same brand throughout the entire repair process for the best results."

Use a putty knife to smooth the filler into any cracks that are less than 0.25 inches (0.64 cm) deep and leave a little extra on top. This way, when the filler dries and shrinks slightly, the cracks will still be filled. [16] X Research source"
