      "title": "Bathe your cat with dish soap.",
      "content": "Bathe your cat with dish soap. Dish soap kills adult fleas that are on your cat. Wet your cat’s fur with room temperature water, then lather the soap in your hands and gently work it through your cat’s fur. Focus on areas where fleas tend to hide, like the back of the neck, base of the tail, armpits, and groin, and avoid the cat’s eyes, nose, and mouth. Let the soap sit for about 5 minutes, then rinse your cat thoroughly, drain the water, and keep them warm until they’re dry. [1] X Research source If you see fleas on your cat’s head while you’re bathing them, use a flea comb to remove them. Dish soap can dry out your cat’s skin, so only give a dish soap bath occasionally—no more than once a month or so. If you can’t bathe your cat, use a spray bottle to wet and rinse them instead. If that doesn’t work, skip to the flea comb."

      "content": "Use a flea comb to remove fleas and flea eggs. Fill a shallow bowl or large cup with soapy water, then use a flea comb to carefully comb through your cat’s fur, close to the skin. Dunk the flea comb in the bowl of soapy water after each pass. If there are any fleas or flea eggs on the comb, the soapy water will kill them. Spend a few minutes each day combing your cat to remove any new fleas or eggs. Flea combs are an inexpensive, very effective way to get fleas off of your cat. And as a bonus, regular grooming can be a bonding experience for you and the cat."

      "title": "Sprinkle diatomaceous earth on your carpets or cat bedding to kill fleas.",
      "content": "Sprinkle diatomaceous earth on your carpets or cat bedding to kill fleas. Parker advises, “Diatomaceous earth is an algae-based product, and it’s a sharp drying powder that kills the fleas. Put it on upholstered furniture, carpets, and bedding, then vacuum it up. Do that for about two weeks to allow any eggs in the house to hatch.” Use a thin layer of food-grade diatomaceous earth and let it sit for a few hours before vacuuming. Although some people recommend putting diatomaceous earth directly on a cat to kill fleas, there’s a chance that this could lead to skin or lung irritation. It’s better to use the powder to treat your cat’s environment. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Vacuum or wash the cat’s bedding daily.",
      "content": "Vacuum or wash the cat’s bedding daily. Parker says, “If you want to be as green as possible when treating fleas, be very thorough about cleaning. Vacuum all of your rugs and couch cushions every single day, and wash everything you can in hot water, especially anything that your pet lays on. If you’re physically picking up the eggs and you’re consistent, you can get control of the problem.” Parker also says, “Vacuuming can help speed up the flea treatment process because the warmth and vibration of the vacuum can trigger the pupa to hatch.”"

      "title": "Rosemary",
      "content": "Rosemary One common herbal flea remedy involves boiling 2 cups of rosemary in 2 pints of water for about 30 minutes. After the mixture cools, strain the leaves and pour the rosemary water into a spray bottle, then spritz your cat and its bedding to discourage fleas. Alternative: Grind up dried rosemary leaves into a fine powder, then sprinkle the powder around the cat’s bedding. Does it work? Rosemary hasn’t been scientifically proven to repel fleas, but studies have shown promising results at its ability to repel other insects, including mosquitos, aphids, and cockroaches. [3] X Research source Is it safe? Probably. In plant form, rosemary is considered non-toxic to cats.

      "title": "Lemon juice",
      "content": "Lemon juice To help kill fleas in your home, add 1 cup (240 ml) of lemon juice to your washing machine when you wash your cat’s bedding. We don’t recommend spraying your cat with lemon water or lemon essential oil or rubbing a cut lemon on their fur. Does it work? There’s a compound in lemons called D-limonene that does impact the life cycle of fleas, so if you’re looking for an all-natural laundry additive that kills fleas, this could work. However, soapy water also kills fleas and it’s less likely to discolor your laundry, so just washing your cat’s bedding is probably good enough. Is it safe? The natural oils found in lemons are considered toxic to cats, so you shouldn’t apply lemon juice (even diluted) directly to your cat. But using it as a laundry additive is probably fine."

      "content": "Chamomile tea Another popular herbal flea treatment involves steeping chamomile tea bags in hot water. After the tea cools, put it in a spray bottle and apply it to your cat’s fur. Does it work? Chamomile probably isn’t super effective at repelling or killing fleas, although some people do plant it to repel fleas in their yard. [6] X Research source However, it’s often used to treat skin inflammation, so it may help soothe your cat’s itchy flea bites. [7] X Research source Is it safe? Maybe not. Some cats may be sensitive to chamomile—side effects can include vomiting, diarrhea, and skin irritation. If you do apply chamomile to your cat, only use a little at a time, and monitor them closely. Stop using it and contact your vet if you notice any adverse effects. [8] X Research source"

      "title": "Lavender",
      "content": "Lavender Lavender is a popular ingredient in DIY flea remedies for cats. But because lavender is toxic to cats, we don’t recommend using homemade lavender sprays to treat for fleas—even on bedding. Does it work? Lavender has a reputation for repelling fleas, but because it poses a danger, it should not be used in homemade herbal flea remedies for cats. Is it safe? No. Lavender essential oil is highly toxic to cats, and you shouldn’t even diffuse it in your home if you have a cat. Even fresh or dried lavender can be harmful, so don’t steep these to make a flea spray for your cat. [9] X Research source"

      "content": "Oregano Some people make an oregano-based flea remedy by mixing 1 part oregano essential oil with 3 parts of a carrier oil, like olive or avocado oil. The oil mixture is then dabbed on the cat in areas where fleas tend to hide. Does it work? Studies have found that oregano is effective against fleas. [10] X Trustworthy Source Science Direct Online archive of peer-reviewed research on scientific, technical and medical topics Go to source However, since oregano isn’t safe to be used on cats, it’s probably not worth the risk. Is it safe? No. Oregano oil is listed as toxic for cats. [11] X Research source"

      "title": "Cumin",
      "content": "Cumin Some people recommend putting a little cumin—less than 1 tsp (3 g)—in your cat’s food. The theory is that this will cause your cat to emit a subtle scent of cumin that will repel the fleas. Does it work? There’s not much evidence on whether this is effective or not. It’s probably better to stick to a proven method (especially one that has less of a chance of upsetting your cat’s digestive system). Is it safe? Sort of. In very small amounts, cumin probably isn’t dangerous for cats. But it might irritate their mouth or cause them to have an upset stomach—if they’re willing to eat it at all. Considering it's probably minimally effective, this one probably isn't worth the trouble. [12] X Research source"

      "title": "Cedar chips",
      "content": "Cedar chips While it’s not technically an herb, cedar is commonly found in DIY flea remedy roundups. Fleas are said to hate the smell of cedar, so placing cedar chips around your cat’s bedding may help discourage fleas from sticking around. Does it work? Cedar oil is a product in some commercial flea repellents, so there’s probably something to this, but more studies are needed to prove definitively how effective cedar is at keeping fleas away from cats. [13] X Research source Is it safe? Possibly not. Several species of cedar are listed as being toxic to cats, so this probably isn’t the safest approach to getting rid of fleas.

      "content": "Apple cider vinegar Apple cider vinegar is a popular ingredient in DIY flea treatments. Advocates say to dilute 1 part vinegar with at least 1 part water, then pour it into a spray bottle and spritz it onto your cat’s fur. Does it work? Apple cider vinegar does not kill fleas. Some people say it repels them, but this hasn’t been scientifically proven—and even if it is, it’s likely just temporary, and the fleas could return as soon as the vinegar dries. [15] X Research source Is it safe? It’s probably safe for cats to consume small amounts of apple cider vinegar in their food or water. But vinegar might be drying or irritating to their skin, and since it won’t be effective at preventing fleas, it’s better to skip this."

      "title": "Coconut oil",
      "content": "Coconut oil Some people say that applying coconut oil to your cat will help smother fleas. The idea is that you work a small amount of the oil into your cat’s fur and down onto their skin, creating a barrier that suffocates the fleas and makes it hard for them to bite your cat. Does it work? Maybe. There’s some evidence that the lauric acid in coconut oil can help repel pests like fleas. It could also make it harder for the fleas to bite your cat. But it won’t be the most effective solution, especially for serious flea infestations—and you’re likely to end up with oil all over your house. [16] X Research source Is it safe? Applying a small amount of coconut oil to your cat’s fur is probably safe. But it’s not healthy for your cat to eat a lot of oils, so applying large amounts or using it regularly could cause your cat to gain more weight than is good for them."

      "title": "Watch for excessive scratching or grooming and physical signs of fleas.",
      "content": "Watch for excessive scratching or grooming and physical signs of fleas. The first sign of a flea infestation is usually that your cat will start scratching or grooming more than usual. If you notice that, check your cat for fleas by parting their fur and examining their fur and skin, looking for signs of skin irritation, flea dirt, or adult fleas. Flea dirt looks like tiny black dots on your cat’s fur. Fleas are small and shiny, and they may appear dark brown or black. They may crawl away or jump while you’re checking the cat. If a cat has a severe flea infestation, you might also notice hair loss, and their gums may appear pale."

However, most don’t kill flea eggs, so it takes regular application to interrupt the fleas’ life cycle and get rid of the infestation. [17] X Research source"

The most effective include ingredients that kill adult fleas and prevent flea larva from maturing. You typically apply these to the skin on the back of your cat’s neck, usually once a month. [18] X Research source Flea collars work in a similar way to spot-on treatments. They’re popular for their convenience, but they’re not always effective at controlling fleas. Additionally, some can cause skin irritation in cats. [19] X Research source"
