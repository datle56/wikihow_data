      "content": "The rottie rumble is a low, rumbling growl Rottweilers make when happy. Unlike an actual growl, Rottweilers exhibit no other signs of aggression when doing the rottie rumble. The vocalization can sound intimidating because it’s so similar to a growl, but it typically means the dog is feeling happy, playful, or content. [1] X Research source The sound is called the “rottie rumble” because it is mainly made by Rottweilers and not other dog breeds. This is also sometimes called “purring.” Dogs often do the rottie rumble when they’re being pet , played with , or receiving another form of affection. Typically, the rottie rumble is accompanied by relaxed body language and a lack of bared teeth."

      "content": "Raised hackles When a dog raises its hackles, the hair on its neck and back will stand on end. This is a response to heightened arousal, so it could mean the dog is aggressive if it feels threatened or defensive. However, raised hackles can also be a sign of fear, curiosity, or excitement, so it’s important to monitor the dog’s other body language.

Go to source When you’re faced with an aggressive dog, dog trainer Belgin Altundag stresses, “You really have to be calm and assertive. Take a deep breath. No touch, no talk, no eye contact. I would move slowly, and I would not look down or baby-talk the dog.”"

      "content": "An intense stare and pinned-back ears Dogs use eye contact to assert dominance, so a dog giving you a hard stare is often a sign of aggression. Similarly, when a dog pins its ears back , it’s instinctively trying to protect them from getting bitten. This could mean the dog is prepared to fight.

      "content": "Tail flagging A dog’s tail can tell you a lot about how they’re feeling. Tail flagging is when a dog holds its tail high and stiffly waves it back and forth. While dogs typically wag their tails to show happiness, this behavior often indicates the dog is displeased and could be aggressive.

The more control a dog has over an exercise like that, the more they can develop trust …It’s definitely not a good idea to force a dog to do anything or to punish a dog for being fearful.”"

      "content": "Showing teeth isn’t always a sign of aggression. Some Rottweilers may show their teeth while doing the rottie rumble. Many people assume this is automatically a sign of aggression, but that isn’t always the case. Some dogs just show their teeth, or “smile,” more than others. However, showing teeth can definitely be a sign of aggression in certain situations. This is why it’s important to observe the rest of the dog’s body language. If its body is tense and its hackles are raised, it’s probably aggressive. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Barking can mean your Rottweiler is excited. When your Rottweiler is excited, they may emit a high-pitched bark accompanied by a full-body wag. This type of bark often means your dog is feeling playful and welcoming, especially if they do it while playing or when greeting you at the door.

Your dog may bark this way when they see a stranger, for instance."

      "title": "Whining may mean your dog wants attention.",
      "content": "Whining may mean your dog wants attention. Rottweilers often whine when they don’t have enough stimulation. Your dog may sit next to you and whine when they want your attention, so make sure they’re properly stimulated to help prevent this. Play with your dog regularly and give them toys to play with when you aren’t around. [9] X Trustworthy Source American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Leading organization dedicated to the prevention of animal cruelty Go to source On the other hand, whining can also indicate pain or fear. Observe your dog’s body language to make sure they’re feeling okay. For example, if your dog has a limp or is keeping to themselves, they may be sick or injured. It’s a good idea to take them to the vet. In general, it’s easy to tell if a dog wants to be pet or not, but it’s possible to misread their body language. Canine behavior specialist Colleen Demling-Riley explains, “A dog will willingly roll onto their back and softly wag while being pet. Some dogs are insecure and will roll on their back but do not want to be pet. Observe the body language to see if they want to be pet. If the dog is stiff, avoiding eye contact, or using their paws to cover their stomach and chest area, they do not want to be pet."

      "title": "Rottweilers are not inherently aggressive.",
      "content": "Rottweilers are not inherently aggressive. Rottweilers are a large breed that often get a bad rap for being scary and aggressive. However, dog trainer David Schmucker assures us, “That’s not true. They have characteristics that, if enhanced, can make them that way, but naturally, I’d say no. If the environment is comfortable and loving, they’re not going to be aggressive.” If your dog is aggressive, “You have to change your mind that they’re a bad dog,” explains Weiss. “Some dogs are more reactive than others. Some are aggressive because they’re afraid. Observe their body language to figure out if they’re afraid, if there are possibly some genetic predispositions, or a mixture of the two.”"
