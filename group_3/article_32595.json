An undescended testicle (also called cryptorchidism). Three out of four cases of testicular cancer occur in an individual with an undescended testicle. Intratubular Germ Cell Neoplasia (IGCN). Often called \"carcinoma in situ\" (CIS), IGCN occurs when cancer cells manifest in germ cells within the seminiferous tubules where these cells are formed. IGCN and CIS is uniform precursors to cancerous tumors of the testes and, in 90% of cases, is found in tissues surrounding a tumor.
