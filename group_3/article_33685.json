      "content": "Stop interacting with them on social media, but don’t unfollow. It’s easy to drop off the radar just by pulling back on social media. That said, immediately unfollowing or unfriending will make it pretty clear to all your mutual friends that you are severing ties with your friend, possibly before they even know that’s what’s happening. Removing them from all your social media makes your private decision to end this friendship public, and ruin the subtlety of fading out of their life. [1] X Research source Instead, mute their account to stop seeing their posts, which makes it easier not to interact with them. If they ask you why you’re not interacting, say you’re trying to use social media less these days, so you don’t always see their posts. Go ahead and unfollow or block them once you no longer see them in person."

Homework, family, religious obligations—these are all reasons you can give for being unable to hang out. School counselor Katie Styzek recommends finding new people to hang out with, but avoid hanging out in the same group as your old friend. [2] X Expert Source Katie Styzek School Counselor Expert Interview. 28 October 2020. Remember, don’t be mean or terse with them. You’re not trying to hurt their feelings here, so just keep it light and say things like, “I’m sorry, life is just running me ragged right now!” If you’re uncomfortable pretending to be busy when your friend calls, then get busy. Join a club or activity that interests you but not your friend. You can meet new people this way and have legitimate reasons for being too busy to hang out."

If you used to tell them about every interaction with your crush, or confide in them about family problems, start to dial that back. Keep your conversations surface-level, sticking to things like school work. Avoid indulging personal details, and also avoid asking them for personal details. [4] X Research source If they want to chat with you for hours about their partner, try to find a way to avoid the conversation, or keep it really short. Tell them you're busy and can't talk, or that you only have a few minutes to talk before you have to be somewhere else. It’s cruel to ghost them altogether. If you happen to run into them, stay cordial and warm , but keep the interaction brief and even professional."

Kim, MA Licensed Marriage & Family Therapist Expert Interview. 14 May 2019. Still, you may want to start the process by putting a little distance between you and them. Keep in mind that if this person is a big part of your life, telling them straight-up that you want to end things could be messy. That doesn’t mean it’s not worth doing, though. If the friendship seems to be on its way out anyway (like if neither one of you seems to be able to find time for each other), just let it fade out on its own. It’s not necessary to tell them you no longer want to be friends."

Because you’re trying to minimize hurt feelings, make sure your reasons are stated tactfully and that you’re not blaming them or being accusatory. [6] X Research source Keep your reasons short, but strong, so that you can remember them in the moment and feel confident, even if it doesn’t feel great. You may want to discuss what to say with another close friend, sibling, or parent. This is fine, and probably a good idea, just make sure it’s someone you trust to keep things quiet."

[7] X Research source Be honest, but don’t make accusations or insults. Try to be nice but stand firm. Don’t say, “Hey, you’ve turned into a jerk and our friendship is over.” Try something like, “Our friendship has become a really negative force in my life, and I think it’s best if we stop being friends .” It’s best to do this in person, but if you can’t, consider writing a letter, instead. Tell them what you appreciate about them to soften the blow, and reassure them that it’s not them, it’s just that you’re not compatible."

Tell them what you appreciate about them to soften the blow, and reassure them that it’s not them, it’s just that you’re not compatible. Even so, they still may not react positively. Try to be understanding and accepting of their reaction. For example, say, “I think we’re growing in opposite directions, and it’s time to cut each other loose.” Or, “You’ve been a wonderful friend, but lately we’re just not helping each other grow.”"

Your friend may feel terrible about how they acted and want to try to save the friendship. If you are willing, you two might be able to talk it out. If your friend tries to bait you into a fight, don’t do it. Don’t involve yourself in a big, dramatic scene. Even if they're calling you names, don’t retaliate. Stay with them until they're okay, or leave if they want you to go. However they feel, respect it and own up to your own actions."

It’s okay to say something non-specific, like, “We just kind of drifted apart,” but don’t get into the details. Talking trash about your former friend is mean and immature, no matter what happened to cause the friendship to fall apart. Most importantly, don't do the same to them .

Things might be awkward for a while, and your friend may be angry or hurt, but treat them with kindness and respect. Remember that this is someone who was once your friend—maybe even your best friend—so honor what you had. When you see them, just give them a small smile or nod of acknowledgment and move along. If they talk to you, turn it into a friendly conversation that won't lead into getting closer. Try to keep talks short until they catch on to your disinterest in the conversation."

[13] X Research source If mutual friends do take sides, try your best to accept it. Discourage them from joining “teams,” but understand if some friends decide not to keep in touch with you.

[15] X Expert Source Jessica George, MA, CHt Certified Professional Master Life Coach Expert Interview. 11 February, 2022. Are you considering ending the friendship because they forgot to attend an important event or because they said something rude about your significant other? Unless this is part of a larger pattern of behavior, letting them know they hurt you may be enough to fix your friendship. If you feel bored by the friendship or dread spending time with them, it may mean your connection has faded, which is natural. If you find you have little in common—you struggle to find things to do together or even things to talk about—then the friendship may have simply run its course. Are they a compassionate, thoughtful friend who sometimes flakes out on your plans or is always late? Think about whether or not your issues are things you can address with them to save the friendship. Is your friend socially anxious, shy, or inept? Do you perhaps see a pathway for being someone who can guide your friend through these troubles?"

If the good in your friendship outweighs the flaws, then try talking to them about the things that upset or hurt you. The problems may be easily fixable, and you may not need to end the friendship after all. Remember, no one is perfect, and there might be some ways in which you can learn to be a better friend, too. In a private setting, let your friend know their behavior is endangering your friendship. Tell them, “It really bothers me when you flirt with my significant other.” or “Hey, it’s really hard for me to hang out with you when you’re always really late. Can you make more of an effort to be on time?” Ending a friendship without giving the person an opportunity to change can be very traumatic. If this person is a good friend, it’s probably worth addressing the problems before you decide to cut the cord."

[17] X Research source If your friend insults you, gets jealous of your other friendships or makes you feel bad about yourself after you interact, it might be time to end the friendship. Do you only hear from them when they need something? Do they use you as a therapist but never return the favor, or ask you to do their homework assignments for them? Do they only focus on the negative things in life? Consider whether or not this is situational—maybe they're just having a rough patch. But if it’s a pattern of behavior, they might be an unhealthy person to be around. Are they extremely competitive? Do they tend to pick fights with you? Are they excessively clingy and too demanding? These are all signs of a toxic friendship. Are they doing things that get you into trouble? If your friend is stealing, hurting people, or generally being bad news, and you seem to get dragged into it, then it's probably not your destiny to \"fix\" things here. Look after your needs first in this instance. Think about how you feel after you spend time with them. If, more often than not, you end up feeling bad about yourself, it’s probably not a healthy relationship."
