      "title": "Most of the NPC quests available earlier in the game will disappear.",
      "content": "Most of the NPC quests available earlier in the game will disappear. Burning the Sealing Tree is the point of no return in the Shadow of the Erdtree DLC. After that, you must progress in the main storyline and can't return to complete certain unfinished sidequests. To obtain allies and gear that will help you defeat the last two bosses, complete these quests before setting the Sealing Tree on fire. [2] X Research source Thiollier & St. Trina : Thioller is an NPC that can aid you in your last two fights against Leda and Radahn. To make him an ally, find St. Trina in the Garden of Deep Purple, which you can access in the Stone Coffin Fissue after beating the Putrescent Knight. Imbibe St. Trina's nectar 4 times until she tells you to \"stop Miquella.\" Attempt to give Thiollier this message and then fight him when he doesn't believe you. After you beat him, imbibe nectar once more and then exhaust Thiollier's dialogue options until he says, \"Aha!\" After that, you should be able to summon him during the final Leda and the Radahn battles. [3] X Research source Hornsent : Hornsent gives you maps of Miquella's Crosses throughout the DLC storyline. At one point in the game, you'll need to choose between helping him or Leda defeat the other (in a battle before you burn the tree and enter Enir-Ilim). You can also choose to summon him to help you fight Messmer, but if you do, he'll ambush you at the Ancient Ruins of Rauh. When you kill him, you can collect all his gear. [4] X Research source Dryleaf Dane : Dryleaf Dane is a monk whom you can summon to help you defeat Rellana, Twin Moon Knight, and Romina, the Saint of the Bud. When you encounter Needle Knight Leda after entering Enir-Ilim, however, she'll summon Dryleaf Dane as her ally, making him your adversary. To find him, go to the High Road Cross Site of Grace and collect the Monk's Missive. The Missive will give you a \"May the Best Win\" gesture. Next, speak to Hornsent to get an updated map and navigate to one of Miquella's Crosses near Moorth Ruins. Use the \"May the Best Win\" gesture toward Dryleaf and go into another realm to fight him. You must defeat him to complete the side quest. [5] X Research source Fire Knight Queelign : You can fight Fire Knight Queelign 2 separate times, at the Belarat, Tower Settlement and the Church of the Crusade. After those battles, go to the Shadow Keep, Church District, find the Prayer Room, and unlock the door with the Prayer Room Key. When you enter, interact with Queelign and give him the Iris of Grace so you can summon him as an ally in future boss fights. [6] X Research source Ansbach : Ansbach is located near the Main Gate Cross Site of Grace. Talk to him to start a lengthy partnership in which you help him find more of Miquella's Crosses, give a letter to Redmane Freyja, find a Secret Rite Scroll, and battle Needle Knight Leda before burning the Sealing Tree (if you choose to help Ansbach instead of her). If you choose to be summoned by Ansbach for that fight, you'll be able to summon him later during your fight with Leda in Enir-Ilim. [7] X Research source Redmane Freyja : Redmane Freyja's quest involves talking to her several times at different locations throughout the game and then giving her a letter from the character Ansbach. No matter what you do, she will spawn as one of Needle Knight Leda's allies, but you can collect her gear afterward to help you in the last boss fight. [8] X Research source Swordhand of Night Jolan : Find Swordhand of Night Jolan at the Cathedral of Manus Metyr in Scadu Altus. There, you'll need to speak to her and Count Amir and then defeat an enemy before fighting Jolan. Once you beat her, use the Iris of Grace on her so you can summon her to help you in future battles. [9] X Research source Moore : Moore is a merchant who provides you with a Black Syrup to give to Thiollier. Find him in the Main Gate Cross Site of Grace and purchase something from him to talk to him. If you kill any members of the Forager Brood more than once, Moore will want to fight you. After the Great Rune breaks in the game, talk to Moore and he will ask you, \"Must we be sad forever?\" meaning him and the other followers of Miquella. If you answer, \"I don't know\" or \"Remain sad forever,\" Needle Knight Leda will not be able to summon him as an ally in Elir-Ilim. [10] X Research source"
