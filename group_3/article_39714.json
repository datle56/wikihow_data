      "content": "The simian line runs across your palm horizontally. This line sits just below your knuckles, and is perpendicular to your fingers. It’s often very pronounced and easy to spot, separating the knuckles from the rest of the palm. While most people have 2 horizontal lines on their palms, people with simian lines only have 1. [2] X Research source The line can appear on 1 or both hands, the latter of which is even rarer."

      "content": "Many believe the simian line indicates good fortune or power. Palmists say that the simian line is a merging of the heart and head lines. They read the simian line as a signifier that a person will accumulate much wealth or find themselves holding great power at some point in their life. [3] X Research source It’s also said to indicate great emotional attunement—those with simian lines are said to feel things very deeply, and help others feel the same. Some say that men with simian lines are likely to be wealthy or a great businessmen if the line is on their right palm, or great leaders if it’s on their left. These characteristics may be even more apparent on people with simian lines on both hands (known as a “double” simian line). They also say that a woman with a simian line may experience great difficulties during her life, but may overcome them with her will and determination. Simian lines are neither good nor bad. Rather, they’re simply a sign that a person may have certain characteristics."

[4] X Research source Often, they have very little trouble learning new things, and they pick up new skills with ease.

Some even say that people with simian lines are geniuses or have especially high IQs, but having a simian line doesn’t guarantee this."

      "content": "Short-tempered Palmists say that those with simian lines tend to be a bit quick to anger. [5] X Research source This could be because these people are confident and sure of themselves and their decisions, and so when someone disagrees with them, it causes problems.

[7] X Research source This makes their relationships, especially the romantic ones, incredibly strong and sometimes a bit turbulent. But people with simian lines are also emotionally sensitive, so they know how much is too much, and when to lay off the gas. It’s often said that women with simian lines are especially prone to unlucky or unhealthy relationships. Read your marriage line along with your simian line—a long and straight marriage line is said to indicate a long and happy relationship."

      "content": "The simian line is known as the “single palmar crease” in medicine. This crease runs horizontally across the palm of the hand. Most people have 3 horizontal creases, but those with a single palmar crease only have 1. Males are twice as likely as females to have a single palmar crease, and only 1 in 30 people have it. [8] X Research source In medicine, professionals rarely use the term “simian line” or “simian crease” to describe this feature. “Simian” refers to a monkey or ape, and so it’s thought that the term has negative connotations."

While many people with single palmar creases show no signs of disorder, the feature is known to sometimes be caused by certain underlying conditions. These include Down syndrome, fetal alcohol syndrome, Trisomy 13 (having 3 copies of chromosome 13), Rubella syndrome (being born from a mother with German measles), and others, such as: [9] X Trustworthy Source MedlinePlus Collection of medical information sourced from the US National Library of Medicine Go to source Aarskog syndrome (genetic disorder linked to altered height, muscles, or skeleton) Cohen syndrome (genetic disorder linked to diminished muscle mass) Turner syndrome (genetic condition in which a female does not have a pair of X chromosomes) Klinefelter syndrome (genetic condition in which a male has an extra X chromosome) Pseudohypoparathyroidism (PHP) (genetic disorder in which someone’s body cannot respond to the parathyroid hormone, which controls some bone function) Cri du chat syndrome (genetic condition in which chromosome 5 is missing) The presence of a single palmar crease isn’t a sure sign that a person has any sort of disorder, but talk to your doctor if you suspect you may have an underlying condition."
