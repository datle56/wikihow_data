Find the center seam and measure 1 inch (2.5 cm) from the center on one side. Mark the point with a piece of chalk. Measure and mark the other side as well. [1] X Research source You can place the buttons on the inside or on the outside of your pants. Placing the buttons on the inside is usually better for a formal look, such as a pair of dress pants. Placing the buttons on the outside is more informal, such as for a pair of blue jeans. [2] X Research source Keep in mind that some suspenders have 2 connecting straps with buttonholes in the back and 2 straps with a buttonhole (1 per strap) in front. However, some suspenders are more elaborate than this and the back connects with 4 buttons while each of the front straps connects with 2 buttons."

      "content": "Place the buttons that attach to the suspenders in the front of your pants so they are centered on each side of the front of your pants. The buttons will go in the areas that are just above the front of your hipbone. It is best to use simple buttons to hold suspenders in place, so avoid anything too ornate. Look for buttons that will match your pants and fit through the suspender buttonholes. To get a good fit, you may want to put on your pants and after you have connected the back buttons. With the back of the suspenders connected by the back buttons, sling the suspenders over your shoulders and find where you want to connect them in front. Mark these areas with chalk to indicate where to sew the buttons onto. [3] X Research source You'll have 2 buttons on the left side, right side, and back of your pants.
