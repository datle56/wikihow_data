      "content": "Yes, you can pack perfume in a carry-on if you follow TSA’s 3-1-1 rule. The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) guidelines state that each liquid, gel, and aerosol must be packed in a 3.4-oz. (100 mL) container (or smaller). All of your liquids must also fit in a single transparent quart-sized bag. The TSA uses “3-1-1” as an easy way to remember what liquids you can take in your carry-on bag: you can use up to a 3 .4 oz (100mL) container size, your liquids must fit in a 1 -quart clear bag, and you only get 1 bag per passenger. [1] X Trustworthy Source U.S. Transportation Security Administration U.S. government agency responsible for ensuring safety by setting and enforcing travel protocols Go to source The 3-1-1 rule applies even to perfumes that are sealed and unused. Containers larger than 3.4 oz. (100 mL) must be packed in your checked baggage, even if the containers aren’t full. Keep in mind that the TSA officer makes the final decision on whether an item is allowed through a checkpoint."

      "title": "Make sure any liquid perfumes are in a 3.4 oz container or smaller.",
      "content": "Make sure any liquid perfumes are in a 3.4 oz container or smaller. When packing your carry-on, use samples or travel-size perfume atomizers to save space in your clear plastic bag. That way, you have room for other liquids like shampoo, conditioner, body wash, and lotion. Most fragrances are available as samples or in travel sizes up to around 0.34 oz. (10 mL). Decant your perfume into a travel atomizer. Travel atomizers are widely available and simple to use by removing the spray cap and inserting the bottle’s nozzle into a special opening on the bottom of the atomizer. You can also opt for solid perfume. Many fragrances are available in solid or balm form, but it may be more difficult to find your favorite scent in this form. Check out Lush, Glossier, and Diptyque for high-end solid perfume options. Most standard-sized perfume bottles are 3.4 oz. (100 mL) or smaller, so you may not even have to repack your perfume in a smaller bottle."

      "content": "Secure the cap of any perfume container in your carry-on. Since your perfume bottle or atomize must be packed inside the 1-quart clear bag, space is limited. Use tape or cling wrap to secure the cap to prevent the spray nozzle from being activated while you’re traveling. Once you go through the security checkpoint, wrap a soft item in your carry-on bag around the clear plastic bag for an added layer of protection."

      "content": "Tape on caps and use cushioning to prevent spills and breakage. When packing toiletries and perfume in your luggage, securely tape the caps to the bottles or wrap with cling wrap to prevent spilling during the flight. Wrap a protective layer of clothing or bubble wrap around the bottle to help keep it from breaking. One of the best ways to protect a perfume bottle in your suitcase is to pack it in its original packaging. Most perfumes come in boxes that have some sort of padding or bracing to protect the bottle during shipment. You can also use packing cubes , which are fabric cubes used to help organize your luggage when packing for air travel . They come in many different sizes that you can use to pack your perfume bottle with protective cushioning, like socks or a small towel."

      "content": "Will TSA throw away my perfume? As long as your perfume meets the TSA’s regulations for liquids in a carry-on bag, they won’t throw it away. However, if you have exceeded your liquids limit, your perfume may be confiscated. Also, keep in mind that the TSA officer may have reason to discard your perfume even if it meets the liquids limit. Ultimately, these officers have the final say over what liquids are allowed on the plane. If the airport has rentable airport storage lockers, you may be able to place your perfume there for the duration of your trip. These lockers range from $8 - $12 per bag per day and may have limits on how long you can rent them. [4] X Research source Check with the airports you fly through to see if lockers are available."

Rules for liquids are generally the same or less restrictive in other countries. Currently, some countries, like Australia, only restrict liquids on international flights. These restrictions are similar to the TSA’s 3-1-1 rule. Several countries, including the United Kingdom, Amsterdam, and Germany, may be removing restrictions on liquids as they install more advanced CT scanners at airport security checkpoints.
