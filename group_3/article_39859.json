Your body has a difficult time digesting a big, heavy meal while you're lying down, and the resulting heartburn, stomach pain, and other discomforts can distract you from your rest. Keep dinners light and simple so your body can digest them quicker, avoid indigestion, and make sleeping easier. [1] X Research source The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: \"Eating too much is misfortune,\" (Shuab al-Iman of Bayhaqi) and \"The believer eats to fill one intestine and the disbeliever eats to fill seven.\" [Hadeeth-Muslim] [2] X Research source By observing regular fasting, unmarried Muslims can learn to control their nighttime desires and avoid bad habits."

Abu Malik Al-Ash`ari reported that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said, “Purity is half of iman (faith).\" [4] X Research source Brushing your teeth is highly encouraged before falling asleep.

Dim the lights, blow off candles, turn off screens, and try to make the environment as quiet as possible. Taking these small steps will go a long way to helping you fall asleep quicker. There is no specific dress code for sleeping. You may dress to feel comfortable or sleep with no clothes as long as there is no danger of someone other than your spouse seeing you."

To wake up on time and not miss it, set an alarm a few minutes before the prayer is supposed to begin. The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: \"Whoever performs the prayer before the rising of the sun [Fajr] and before its setting [Asr], will not enter hell,\" [Muslim] and \"Whoever prays the two cooler prayer times (i.e. Fajr and Asr) will enter Paradise.\" [Al-Bukhari and Muslim] Getting up for Fajr is a struggle for many Muslims, especially in the summer in northern latitudes, if they are not used to waking up so early. Try your best to go to bed soon after Salatul Isha so you'll be able to wake up more easily in the morning."

Doing so will please Allah and strengthen your faith. At the time of intercourse, both husband and wife should recite \"Bismillaah, Allahuma jannabnash shaytaana wa jannabish shaytaana maa razaqtanaa,\" meaning, \"In the name of Allah, O Allah! Save us from the Shaytaan and prevent Shaytaan from that which you grant us (i.e. children).\" Both husband and wife should perform ghusl janabat after intercourse, and certainly before salah or handling the Qur'an.

Finally, make a Dua, or a prayer of requests and supplications to Allah. After you've fulfilled these requirements, lie down to sleep right away so the night will pass quickly, and you can start a new day with the morning prayers.

In these situations, you can seek out a dream interpretation or pray to Allah to bring you a sense of peace and understanding regarding the visions you saw. Be aware that the Shaytaan is close by when you sleep. During episodes of sleeplessness, many people are vulnerable to insinuating thoughts that lead to disbelief (kufr) or temptation to satisfy desires in haram ways. Protect yourself in these situations by praying and seeking refuge with Allah. It was reported that Abu Qutaadah said: \"The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: 'Good dreams come from Allah and bad dreams come from the Shaytaan. If anyone of you sees a bad dream which makes him afraid, let him spit drily to his left [shoulder] and seek refuge with Allah from its evil, then it will not harm him.'\" [Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 3118; Muslim, 2261] [15] X Research source"

This practice is recommended if you are usually exhausted by the end of the day. A man asked the Prophet (peace be upon him): \"How are the night prayers done?\" and he replied, \"Two by two, then when you fear that dawn is about to break, pray Witr with one rak’ah.\" [Narrated by al-Bukhaari] [22] X Research source"
