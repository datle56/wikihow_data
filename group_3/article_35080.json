      "content": "Think before you react. Being insulted will likely make you feel angry and defensive. While it's okay to feel angry and upset about what was said, attacking back will likely lead to more arguments and frustration. Find calm and patient words to say how you feel about what was said. [2] X Research source If it seems like your husband is trying to belittle you, and there is a pattern of this behavior, consider saying, \"I recognize that you're trying to make me feel bad about myself. I won't let you hurt me. I am stronger than that.\" If your husband is generally understanding, but said that you're fat in a heated moment, consider saying, \"What you just said makes me feel small and ugly. Can we focus on how to make things better without hurting each other?\" Reader Poll: We asked 214 wikiHow readers, and 57% agreed that the best way to handle your husband saying something hurtful to you is to defend yourself in a respectful but firm way so he knows he can't talk to you like that .

      "content": "See if you and your husband can talk rather than argue. Consider approaching the conversation as a way to discuss what is bothering you and your husband, rather than blaming one another. Consider turning the hateful words into a way to more effectively communicate. If your husband is resistant to talking about what's bothering him, or listening to what's bothering you, you may need to evaluate whether you both are able to talk about each other's feelings effectively. Consider whether you and your husband are able to talk about difficult subjects without feeling emotionally drained, exhausted, and disrespected. Try to focus the conversation on finding compromise instead of attacking each other."

While you may seek approval from your husband, understand that he can't change how you feel about yourself, but you can. [3] X Research source While getting words of reassurance from your husband can help to boost your self-esteem, don't rely solely on him to determine how you feel about yourself or your appearance. Practice building up your self-esteem and self-worth. Consider saying these words of self-affirmation: \"My self-worth is not determined by the number on the scale,\" or \"I am more than my appearance.\" [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Figure out your goals, regardless of what your husband says. Don't fall into despair when your husband says you're fat. If you already have certain goals about your body image, keep them going. Avoid letting your husband control the goals that you have for your health, your happiness, and your life. Determine what goals feel right for you about your health and body image. Determine what makes you feel special and appreciated. Advocate for yourself and your needs. Find ways to feel good about who you are beyond what your husband says. Think about what activities make you truly happy. If your husband’s comment didn’t strike a nerve, deal with the name calling rather than focusing on the bit about your appearance."

      "content": "Practice self-care. When you've been hurt or insulted, you may feel like you want to retreat or fight back. Rather than expending so much energy on negative thoughts and feelings, focus on what makes you feel positive about yourself and your life. Take time for yourself to do these things: [5] X Research source Reflect on the positive things about you and your body. Write in a journal about what you like about yourself. Choose at least 3 things to write about. Do activities that are independent of your spouse or family. Have a night out with your friends. Go out and explore a new place. Cross something off your bucket list. Focus on activities that restore a sense of peace and love for your body. Consider gentle yoga or meditation. Get a massage.

Does he say insulting and demeaning things that make you feel helpless and ashamed of yourself? [6] X Research source If your husband knows that your weight is a sensitive subject, he is lashing out on purpose to hurt you. Consider keeping a record of how often your husband insults you or makes you feel bad. Is it multiple times a day? Or is it once in a few months? If you are being mistreated regularly, this may not be a healthy relationship. If you feel like you've been hurt over and over by your husband's rude and demeaning words, you may be suffering from abuse. No one should make you feel less than, particularly your husband."

It's important that you feel equal to your husband, and that you feel your views and thoughts are being respected. Consider these questions as you evaluate if respect is part of your relationship: Do you trust your husband? Do you feel safe to talk with him about what you're feeling? Do you feel appreciated for what you do and who you are?"

Instead, reach out to your loving and supportive friends or family. Gain strength and wisdom from others who have overcome body image issues or difficult relationships."
