When a player completes a successful surgery, the banker will give them their monetary reward. Pick a player who is good with numbers to handle this role while you play.

Make two different piles for each card and shuffle them until they are thoroughly mixed. If you have played with these cards recently, spend extra time shuffling them to make sure they are mixed well. [2] X Research source There should be 24 cards total—12 Doctor and 12 Specialist cards."

The \"Funatomy\" pieces are the different body parts that you will attempt to extract from the patient, Cavity Sam, who doubles as the board. Match each piece to its spot on Cavity Sam and drop it in the hole. [3] X Research source You would drop the \"Charlie Horse\" piece, for example, in the hole just above Cavity Sam's right knee. The only piece that will not be dropped into a hole is the \"Ankle Bone Connected to the Knee Bone.\" This piece should be looped over both narrow pegs on either end of its corresponding hole."

Once the game begins, you can look at your Specialist cards. Operation is designed to accommodate 1-6 players at a time. [6] X Research source"

Use the metal tweezers to grasp the Funatomy piece and lift it out of Cavity Sam's body without touching the sides of the hole. If you touch the sides, the buzzer will sound and Cavity Sam's nose will light up. This signifies that the operation was unsuccessful and your turn is over. [7] X Research source Traditionally, the youngest player goes first when playing Operation. [8] X Research source In the 2008 edition, Cavity Sam will make a specific sound in addition to buzzing for each ailment. [9] X Research source"

[11] X Research source If a player failed to remove a spare rib piece, for example, the player with the spare rib Specialist card has a chance to finish the operation. If the Specialist is also unsuccessful, put the Doctor card back into the pile. That piece is now back in play."
