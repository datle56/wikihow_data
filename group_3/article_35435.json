Each child is different, and some may accomplish milestones such as talking, walking, and reading slower or faster than other children, but kids with Fragile X Syndrome learn these skills at a very late age. Check if they have accomplished the following milestones at age 2: Sitting Walking Talking"

Many kids are slow in eating solid foods, reading, or doing academic work at first, but kids with Fragile X Syndrome might take longer than the average kid. They may have problems reading, writing, or doing math work at school."

      "content": "Know what causes Fragile X syndrome. Fragile X syndrome is a genetic disorder, meaning that it is passed on by genes. A change to a gene on the X-chromosome called the FMR1 gene causes Fragile X syndrome. [4] X Research source When the gene is changed or altered, the gene cannot produce a certain protein that makes the brain work normally. This causes Fragile X syndrome."

But they have many differences too, such as how they are caused and other symptoms that differentiate between them. Autism is not caused by one single genetic mutation, whereas Fragile X syndrome is caused by a mutation in the FMR1 gene. Autistic people do not have seizures (unless they have epilepsy), whereas some people with this syndrome have seizures. Autistic people do not have a specific appearance, whereas most kids with Fragile X syndrome have low muscle tone, large foreheads, large ears, and other physical traits that indicate the condition."

But they have many differences too, such as how they are caused and other symptoms that differentiate between them.

Introversion is not a condition- it is just someone's personality. Social anxiety is not caused by one gene- it can be environmental or genetic. Fragile X syndrome is caused by a mutation in the FMR1 gene. People with Fragile X syndrome are more likely to have social anxiety, whereas people with social anxiety are not more likely to have Fragile X syndrome."
