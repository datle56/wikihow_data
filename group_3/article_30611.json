      "content": "Measure from the top-corner to the opposite bottom corner. You should be measuring at a diagonal in inches. Only include the display area. Exclude the bezels/borders around your monitor. [1] X Research source Screen size is generally what you want to know when purchasing a new monitor. While monitors can range from 19 inches to 40+ inches, common sizes include 21.5 inches, 24 inches, 27 inches, and 32 inches."

      "content": "Use the pythagorean theorem (optional). If the screen is too large to measure diagonally or if you don’t want to smudge it, you can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the diagonal distance. Square the screen’s height and the screen’s width, add the 2 numbers together, then find the square root of the sum, which is the diagonal measurement. [2] X Research source For example, if the height is 10 inches (25.4 cm), multiply that by itself (10x10=100). Then, multiply the length, 16 inches (40.6 cm), by itself (16x16=256). Add the 2 numbers together (100+256=356), then find the square root of the sum (√356=18.9)."

      "content": "Multiply the length by the height. To find the image area, multiply the height of the monitor by the length of the monitor. Express the image area in “horizontal length x vertical height.” For instance, if the length is 16 inches (40.6 cm) and the height is 10 inches (25.4 cm), the image area can be found by multiplying 16 by 10, which equals 160 square inches."

      "content": "Determine the aspect ratio by comparing the length and height. Computer monitors are usually made with an aspect ratio of 4:3, 5:3, 16:9, or 16:10. To find the aspect ratio, compare the length to the height and reduce the numbers if necessary. [3] X Research source If the length is 16 inches (40.6 cm) and the height is 10 inches (25.4 cm), the aspect ratio is 16:10. If the length is 25 inches (63.5 cm) and the height is 15 inches (38.1 cm), the aspect ratio is 25:15, which can be divided by 5 to reduce it to 5:3."
