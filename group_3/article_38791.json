      "content": "“Sending me” means something is extremely funny, delightful, or absurd. “Sending me” is a slang term that expresses extreme amusement and joy, though it can also convey surprise or even frustration (though amusement is much more common). Generally, it indicates having a strong emotional reaction to something. So, if something is “sending you,” you don’t find it mildly funny—it’s hilarious! It’s unclear where “Sending me” originates, though the phrase became popular online in the late 2010s. You can also say “Sent me” (in the past tense) or “Sending me so hard” to indicate an even more intense reaction than usual."
