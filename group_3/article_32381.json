      "title": "Just treat it like a normal day.",
      "content": "Just treat it like a normal day. Do not think about tomorrow, as you will become more excited and anxious for the joys that await, and you won't be able to concentrate on doing anything, and when you're waiting for something to happen it'll feel like a lot longer than it actually is."
    },
    {
      "title": "Keep busy to make time fly and keep yourself preoccupied.",
      "content": "Keep busy to make time fly and keep yourself preoccupied. To do this you should treat the day like it's just an average day. Activities such as meeting up with friends and doing something (NOT shopping as you may accidentally purchase something someone has already got for you.) or walking/running, swimming or even staying at home and doing homework, cleaning your room will keep your mind off Christmas and on the task at hand so you don't feel super Christmassy."
    },
    {
      "title": "Make sure you save some work (like cleaning and wrapping) for this day so you have something to do!",
      "content": "Make sure you save some work (like cleaning and wrapping) for this day so you have something to do! If you find yourself without any work (any type of work or activity is homework, cleaning, wrapping etc.). Your mind will find its way back to Christmas! So this is probably the first time you'll ever read this, but skip a nights homework! It'll give you something to do."
    },

      "title": "Follow a routine.",
      "content": "Follow a routine. Make it feel average, just like in the day."
    },
    {
      "title": "Tire yourself out.",
      "content": "Tire yourself out. Lie down and relax. Curl up on the couch with hot chocolate and a movie to watch. Don't get up, but get comfy. Don't watch an action movie!"
    },
    {
      "title": "Give yourself a spa treatment, if you're a girl or have a good idea of what to do as a guy.",
      "content": "Give yourself a spa treatment, if you're a girl or have a good idea of what to do as a guy. If you don't have anything, or you're a guy who can't think of anything, take a hot bath with bath salts and rose petals also listen to calming music, maybe even light a candle. File your nails, or get a massage."
    },
    {
      "title": "Use the reading method.",
      "content": "Use the reading method. Snuggle up in bed with a good book, preferably one you've read and one that's very easy. Read until you don't want to anymore or until you can't keep your eyes open. Then, go to the bathroom and read more until you're extremely tired out. Falling asleep should be a breeze."
    },
    {
      "title": "Sleep for as long as possible.",
      "content": "Sleep for as long as possible. If you wake up, unless you have to use the bathroom, don't look at the clock or even open your eyes. Sleeping is an ideal way to pass time. Pretend that you have to wake up when your parents wake up, so you want to fall asleep and sleep in. If you are up hours, or even just an hour before you are allowed to wake up your parents/open presents it will feel like a lot longer as you are waiting in suspense, so keep yourself (quietly) occupied. If you wake up and can't get back to sleep, then do a quiet activity that doesn't involve electronics (ie reading, writing, tidying your room)."
    },
    {
      "title": "If you can open your stocking, do so.",
      "content": "If you can open your stocking, do so. Open it very slowly. Now, you have more new entertainment. If you have to wait until everybody's up to do stockings then follow the suggestions in the previous step to keep yourself occupied. By now other excited siblings (if you have siblings) are probably starting to wake up as well. Tell them that you can't wake your parents up yet and suggest things to do such as: make the family breakfast (if you are allowed to use the toaster, jug etc.), play a board game, play video games together (quietly!)"

      "title": "If you decided to make breakfast and you know your parents would let you, make an elaborate breakfast.",
      "content": "If you decided to make breakfast and you know your parents would let you, make an elaborate breakfast. Not just microwave pancakes, go big. French toast, eggs, homemade pancakes/waffles, etc. Then, savor each bite like it's your last."

    {
      "title": "If you have to stay in your room, read this.",
      "content": "If you have to stay in your room, read this. Siblings are a great way to entertain if you can't leave. You can tell each other stories and play games and do endless things. You could also use electronics. Watch TV, browse the web, etc. You could also read or do homework. Find entertainment in the things you've got. Cleaning might be your best bet because you need room for your gifts."

    {
      "title": "If you can leave your room, read this.",
      "content": "If you can leave your room, read this. The steps above are also available. Watch something in the living room. Look around at the gifts. Observe the tree. If parents/guests/pets/siblings are sleeping, refrain from things such as TV, talking on the phone and anything noisy as you may wake sleeping people."
