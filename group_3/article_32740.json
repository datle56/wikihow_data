      "content": "Consider the types. When you are picking out a watch, you should understand the different types you can buy. There are three main types of watches: analog, digital, and analog/digital. An analog watch holds hour and minute hands with the hours depicted with numbers, marks, or roman numerals. Digital watches display time in numerical form on either an LCD or LED face. Analog/digital watches combine the two other types into one watch. Analog watches are typically considered traditional and are good for business and formal occasions as well as dates. Digital watches are very casual. Analog/digital watches are practical because they can be worn everyday and are also good for work, but they aren't for formal occasions. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Discover the materials.",
      "content": "Discover the materials. There are two elements on a watch where materials matter. The case and the band will change materials depending on the brand, style, type, and price of the watch. The case, or part that holds the face of the watch, typically can be made of plastic, resin, metal such as steel, brass, or titanium, as well as precious metals such as gold, silver, and platinum. The bands can be made in all of the materials as cases, with the addition of materials such as canvas, leather (real and fake), and exotic skins. The price of these materials vary greatly. Plastic will obviously be the cheapest, cheap, synthetic materials will fall next, leather and other skins will be slightly more, typical metals will be next, while the precious metal watches are typically the most expensive. Those prices will vary depending on the quality of the precious materials. For example, metal ranges from the least expensive 10K metals to the more expensive 18K metals.

      "title": "Know movement types.",
      "content": "Know movement types. Movement types are the power sources for the watches. Watches use three basic movement types: battery, quartz, and mechanical. Battery movement utilizes batteries as the only source of power. Quartz movement runs when the power of a battery is sent through the quartz on the inside of the watch. Mechanical movement relies on the wearer winding the elements, which is either manual or automatic. Battery watches are the cheapest and least luxurious. Digital watches and watches bought at department or clothing stores are typically battery watches. Quartz watches are slightly more expensive than traditional battery watches, but are the most accurate of all the different types. They require little maintenance aside from occasionally replacing the battery and are not prized by collectors due to the simplicity of their design. Mechanical watches are either wound by hand (manual) or are wound throughout the day by the movements of the wearer (automatic, or self-winding). These watches are the most expensive, most luxurious, and are prized most by collectors due to the intricacy of their design. [4] X Research source [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Decide on a style.",
      "content": "Decide on a style. You can buy watch styles specifically designed for sports, work, formal events, going out, and casual outfits. Where you are going to be wearing your watch should be the main factor in deciding what style of watch to buy. If you are going to use it while running, swimming, or you want some extra features dealing with heart rate, you should go with a sports watch , field watch or divers watch . If you need a watch to wear to work, formal events, or dates, your best bet would be to buy a dress watch . If you just need a day to day watch to wear with everything, buy a casual watch . If you need it for all kinds of occasions from work to everyday life, go with a dress watch. It looks better when you wear casual clothes with a dress watch than it does to wear a casual watch with office attire. [6] X Research source [7] X Research source The gadget watch is an emerging style that keeps gaining popularity every year, though they are still most popular with tech savvy individuals. They have features that include things such as calendars, digital cameras, and e-mail programs, just to name a few.

      "content": "Choose a brand. Keeping your budget in mind, look through the kinds of brands that make watches and decide your favorites. Many companies have been around for years, so picking a brand can be overwhelming. Research the company's history to see how long they have been making watches and what styles they have. Ask your family and friends who have bought watches in the past what brands they like and have worked best for them. You can even do some online investigation, reading reviews about certain companies and their watch models. You need to make sure that the brand you choose has the style that you decide you want.

      "title": "Consider the features.",
      "content": "Consider the features. When you are picking out the ideal watch, you need to know what feature you need and want included on your watch. All watches have basic models and more elaborate models. You can buy anything from a dress watch that only tells time to a casual watch that has a computer in it to a sports watch that will tell you your heart rate, the distance you've traveled, and calories burned, just to name a few. The more impressive the gadgets, the more expensive the watch. It truly depends on what your need your watch for. For example, if you are going to be doing a lot of international travel for business, you might think of buying a dress watch that allows you to tell time across multiple time zones. The possibilities are vast and varied. [12] X Research source [13] X Research source One main feature you may want to consider is the level of water resistance. The level of resistance needed depends on the amount of water that you want to wear your watch in. Generic water resistance will handle spills and rainstorms. The upper levels of water resistance vary from 50 meter (160 ft) to 1000 meter resistance, which covers washing dishes to deep sea scuba diving and everything in between.

      "title": "Adjust the fit.",
      "content": "Adjust the fit. When you have found all the elements on a watch that you like, you now need to take the last step, which is to make sure that the watch fits you. You want your watch band to be tight enough that it doesn't slide around your wrist but loose enough that it doesn't cut off your circulation. You want the watch case to be small or large enough to look proportionate on your arm but not go too much in the other direction either way. A good size test for your watch is to try to shift your watch up and down your arm. If it can move, it is too small. If it doesn't and it leaves an imprint on your wrist when you remove it, it is too big. If it doesn't leave an imprint and you can't shift it up and down your arm, then your watch fits perfectly. If you are a tall or husky guy, you need to ensure that the watch band is not going to be too small for you and that the watch face isn't too small for your proportions. If you have small wrists or a slight frame, you need a smaller watch band and face. [16] X Research source"

      "content": "Decide on a budget. Some people are willing to spend more on a watch than others. When you first start looking into watches, decide what price range you are comfortable with. Ask yourself what you need to watch for, and then decide what price you are willing to pay to fulfill that need. Watches can be as low as $20 at a department store to over $25,000 from a designer company. The price varies depending on style, material, brand, and movement. [17] X Research source Keep in mind that the kind of watch you want will factor in to the price. If you can, have a little bit of wiggle room in your price just in case you want or need an expensive feature. [18] X Research source"

      "title": "Spend $300 and under.",
      "content": "Spend $300 and under. There are many types of watches that can be bought on a modest budget. You can expect materials such as cloth, leather, and stainless steel on the casing and bands. They have battery and solar quartz movement and low to moderate water resistance. Many sports watches come in this range, though some of the more technologically advanced options will cost more. If you buy from a major retailer, watches can be extremely cheap, but you will not likely find any with advanced features or long lasting materials unless you spend a little bit more. Most department stores carry watches in many price ranges, but you can find watches within this range from good brands that are good quality. In you are looking at major retailers such as Target and Walmart, try brands such as Timex and Casio. These are typically under $100. For example, the Timex Expedition Dive Style Chronograph Watch has a stainless steel band and casing, battery quartz movement, analog display, and water resistance up to 200 meters (660 ft). It also has the bonus feature of a night mode, which illuminates the screen even with no natural light. Department stores like Macy's offer brands such as Guess, Tommy Hilfiger, and Fossil. They are typically between $250-300. For example, the Seiko SKS407 has a stainless steel case and band, analog display, quartz movement, and water resistance up to 100 meters (330 ft). It also has three additional dials that measure minutes, seconds, and milliseconds as well as a date counter. [19] X Research source"

You can still get features such as rubber, cloth, and leather bands, stainless steel casing, and quartz movement in this range, but there are better brands such as Bulova, Hugo Boss, and Armani, as well as better materials and more advanced features available at this level. Most major retailers will not carry watches this expensive, but department stores and stores for the specific brands do carry watches within this range. Bulova is one of the best brands available at this level. Their watches look like high end watches but are in a price range that is affordable. They are also good if you want a sturdier material than stainless steel. Look for watches like the Bulova 96B133, which has a titanium band and case, quartz movement, and with a water resistance of 300 meters (980 ft). [20] X Research source"

      "content": "Buy for $750-2,000. Once you get over $750, you can start buying in some more high end department stores such as Nordstrom. You can also buy more high end watch brands such as Shinola and Movado. They come in leather, stainless steel, titanium, varying degrees of water resistance, and have analog faces with quartz movement. Two major features that can make watch more expensive in this range is the Swiss construction and the PVD coating. The Swiss are known for their watch making abilities, making their watches higher end than others. The PVD coating is resistant to wear and tarnish. Look for watches like a Movado Sapphire Synergy, which has a scratch resistant face, swiss quartz movement, and PVD stainless steel. [21] X Research source"

Watch designers such as Rolex, Cartier, Glashütte, Patek Philippe, and A. Lange & Söhne have watches that can range from $5,000 to $100,000 and beyond. The materials include all the precious metals, although some are still stainless steel. The movement is almost entirely manual. Rolex does does have a lower priced collection of Air Kings, which retail for under $6,000. [23] X Research source If you want to be extremely extravagant, try the Audemars Grand Royal Oak Offshore Complications.
