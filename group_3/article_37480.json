[1] X Research source The ability to restore Streaks isn't available everywhere yet. If you don't see the ability to restore your Streak and it's within 48 hours of the Streak ending, your region may not have access to this feature. If it's been over 48 hours since the Streak ended, you will not be prompted to restore the Streak. You have a limited number of Streak restores available at any given time. TikTok does not specify how many restores you get, but some users have said they have two to three restores available per month. [2] X Research source"

If you lost your TikTok Streak and you don't see an option to restore it, you can try changing the time zone on your phone to trick the TikTok app into thinking it's earlier than it is. [3] X Research source First, figure out what time zone you need to be in. Use Google or your favorite search engine to find a time zone that is behind your current time zone that is still in the previous day. Change your phone's time zone. On iPhone, go to Settings > General > Date & Time . On Android, you can either open the Clock app or go to Settings > System > Date & time (exact menu names may vary based on your Android model). Toggle off the setting to set your time and/or time zone automatically. Tap the option to change your time zone and select the desired time zone. Return to TikTok and attempt to restore your Streak. Note that this method may not work, and you may not be able to restore your Streak."

[5] X Research source Then tap the + button in the upper-left corner and create a new chat with your Streak partner. The option to restore your Streak should appear now.

Tap the three-line button in the upper-right corner. Tap Settings and privacy > Report a Problem . Scroll down and tap Chat with us . This will get you to a chat with the TikTok helpdesk, where you can request more help. This is an automated chatbot, but you may be able to get help if you request to speak with a real person."

When you've messaged back and forth with someone for at least three days in a row, you will see a fire emoji next to that person's chat in your inbox. The number next to the fire emoji indicates how many days you've been talking with that person. If you haven't sent messages with your Streak partner that day, the badge will be gray. If you send messages within 24 hours of the badge turning gray, the emoji will turn orange, the counter will go up, and the Streak will be retained. If you don't message within 24 hours, the Streak will be lost."

Having a really high Streak number doesn't get you any perks, but it can be a fun way to show off how much you and your friend spend talking to one another. However, many users have expressed that Streaks make them feel stressed out because they're afraid of losing them. [6] X Research source Remember that Streaks are just a fun feature, and maintaining a long Streak doesn't mean that you aren't friends with someone. If keeping up a Streak is weighing you down, consider taking a break. Other users have stated they've lost friends because they didn't keep up a TikTok Streak. If someone ended a friendship with you, talk to a trusted friend, parent, adult, or other person in your life if you feel like you need the support. You can try to rekindle the friendship with your friend, but wait until they've come to terms with their feelings regarding the Streak being lost. Bringing it up right away might push them away farther. If you are considering ending a friendship with someone because they didn't keep up a TikTok Streak, recontextualize the situation by imagining if you'd still be their friend if TikTok Streaks stopped existing tomorrow. Remember that sometimes things come up, and your friend may not be in the mood to talk on TikTok right now."

      "content": "No, TikTok Streaks cannot earn you money. There have been rumors going around TikTok that if you get a long Streak number (such as 100) you will get paid by TikTok. This rumor is not true, and TikTok has never advertised that they will pay any users who get a certain Streak number. [7] X Research source If someone posts a link saying that you will get paid for your TikTok Streak if you click it, do not click it . At worst, these links are likely phishing scams that will attempt to scrape your personal information. At best, these links are simply false and are a waste of your time. If you have clicked on one of the links, don't supply any information. Exit the tab or window that you used to open the link immediately. Run a malware or antivirus scan if you're on your computer, and make sure no suspicious programs were installed on your computer or phone. You could also change the passwords to your TikTok and bank accounts if you're concerned that this information was stolen."
