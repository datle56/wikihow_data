In severe cases of mono your healthcare provider may prescribe steroids to reduce swelling in your spleen or liver; such treatment is needed only in severe cases of mono. You can also be prescribed antibiotics to fight strep throat. Your health care provider might also do blood tests to look for antibodies that your immune system makes in response to EBV and/or white blood cells that your body makes to fight EBV.
