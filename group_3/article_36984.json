      "content": "Put on gloves, safety glasses, and a face mask. Ceilings, attics, and drywall can be dusty, dirty, and contain fiberglass and other particles that can get into your skin and eyes and irritate your throat and lungs if you breathe it in. Before you start working, put on some thick work gloves, safety glasses, and a face mask so you’re protected. [1] X Research source You can find safety equipment at home improvement stores, at department stores, and online. Make sure the glasses fit snugly over your eyes so dust can’t get in on the sides. You may want to wear a thick pair of jeans and a long-sleeved shirt to add additional protection to your skin."

      "content": "Take out any items stored in the attic, if necessary. If the ceiling you’re replacing has an attic above it, access it and look for any items that may be stored in there. Old suitcases, clothes, and other items that you have stored in your attic need to be taken out before you start working. [2] X Research source Speed up the process by having somebody stand below the access point so you can hand them items that you remove."

      "content": "Pull out the insulation yourself if your home was built after 1970. Look for insulation in the attic above the room. If you’re sure the insulation doesn’t contain asbestos, pull out all of the insulation by pulling it up and carrying it out of the room. You can set it aside to replace it whenever you install your new ceiling drywall. [3] X Research source If your attic has flooring that is covering the insulation, wait until you remove the old ceiling drywall to remove the insulation from below rather than removing the flooring. If the ceiling does not have an attic above it, wait until you remove the old ceiling drywall to take out the insulation."

Older homes often used insulation that contains asbestos, which can cause serious respiratory disease if it is inhaled. If your home was built before 1970, do not attempt to remove or disturb the insulation above your ceiling to avoid exposure to asbestos. Contact a professional to come test your insulation to make sure it’s safe for you to handle. [4] X Research source Search online for asbestos removal professionals in your area."
