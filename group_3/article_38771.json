      "content": "Pack your mail in a sturdy box and surround it with ample padding. Your package has a long way to go, so make sure to surround the item or items on every side so it can’t slide around. Test if there’s enough padding by gently shaking the box side-to-side and up-and-down; if the items clang around, add more packaging materials. [1] X Research source Bubble wrap, shredded paper, airbags, foam pieces, or crumpled paper can provide padding without adding too much extra weight to the package. Save the packaging materials when you get mail and reuse them when you have parcels to send out. If the contents of the package are fragile, write “FRAGILE” on each side of the box in large, all-cap letters. Some prohibited items that you can’t ship to the UK include hand sanitizer, aerosols, alcohol, cigarettes, ammunition, fresh fruits and vegetables, nail polish, perfume, marijuana, and explosives."

      "content": "Tape the sides down with 2 in (51 mm) wide tape. Make sure all the seams are tightly secured. If you need to, overlap 2 pieces of tape. Check to make sure there are no loose flaps on any part of the package. [2] X Research source Avoid using twine, bows, ribbon, or other varieties of string to close your package. Those types of materials are likely to get caught or ripped during transportation."

      "content": "Write a return address label in the upper lefthand corner of the package. If you’re reusing a box, make sure any old labels are removed or marked out with a black permanent marker. Use a pen or marker that will be easily visible against the color of the package, and write as neatly as you possibly can. Include your name or business, address, city, zip code, and country. [3] X Research source The return address should look something like this: Maya Pataky 123 Star Lane Akron, OH 44304 USA Don’t write with pencil—there’s too big a chance it could get smudged and become illegible. Return addresses are required by the United States Postal Service for security purposes."

Fill in the required information, including details about the package’s content, weight, and value. Put the completed form into a special customs envelope and peel off the backing to stick it to the top of the package. Make sure the barcode on the form is visible!

You can calculate, pay for, and print shipping labels from home if you have a printer, or you can take your package to the post office and have them calculate the cost for you. Cost is based on weight, the dimensions of the package, and how quickly you want it to arrive at its destination. [6] X Research source To calculate the amount of postage you’ll need, visit https://postcalc.usps.com/?country=10440 . For example, a small package weighing less than 4 pounds (1.8 kg) in a 13 by 11 in (330 by 280 mm) box would cost about $75 to ship. To mail a book that weighs a little less than 1 pound (0.45 kg) in a small box or envelope would cost about $56. To mail several candles that weigh about 10 pounds (4.5 kg) in a 12 by 12 in (300 by 300 mm) box would cost about $102."

If the contents are delicate or breakable, add a “FRAGILE” sticker to the package. If you’re mailing perishable baked goods, wrap them in plastic wrap and then surround them in bubble wrap to keep them as safe and as fresh as possible. Use an insulated foam container if you’re mailing food items that need to remain cold. You could also use gel packs or dry ice to keep the food from getting warm."
