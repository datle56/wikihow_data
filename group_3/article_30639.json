Just be sure to swap this number into your final calculation."

Then measure the distance you walked. Start your measurements where you took your first step, and use a ruler, yardstick, or measuring tape to find the distance to your last step. [3] X Research source For the most accurate measurement, measure in inches or centimeters, rather than feet or meters. Round up or down to the nearest whole number. For example, the distance may be 180.3 inches (458 cm), which rounds down to 180 inches (460 cm)."

For instance, if your distance is 180 in (460 cm), you will get 18 in (46 cm) after you divide by 10. Your step length is 18 in (46 cm) or 1.5 ft (0.46 m). Repeat this 2-3 times to find an accurate average. To calculate your average, add up the total of all your stride lengths, and divide them by the total number of times measured."

[5] X Research source That’s why now, you’ll multiply your step length by 2 to find your stride length. If you’re finding stride length to help calculate a pedometer or other fitness device, check the device’s manual to see if they count stride length as just a step, or a full stride.

If you don't want to make a mark on the wall, stick your pencil at the crown of your head (eraser end), and back away from the wall with your pencil still in place.

[6] X Research source A “stride,” scientifically, is 2 steps, so if you multiply your height by 0.41 x 2, or 0.82, you’ll get a fair estimate of your own stride length. Remember that estimating stride length by height is a quick way to find an approximation, but this method is not the most accurate for individual stride lengths. If your height measured to 165 cm (65 in), multiply this by 0.82 for a total of 135.3 cm (53.3 in). Or, multiply your height by just 0.41 to find your approximate step length, as opposed to stride length."

[7] X Expert Source Kai Ng Certified Running Coach Expert Interview. 12 February 2021. Use a meter stick or distance counter tool to plot out a course that’s anywhere from 20–400 m (66–1,312 ft) long, or use a run tracking app to do the same. Ng recommends finding a running track, which are usually 400 m (1,300 ft) long per lap. [8] X Expert Source Kai Ng Certified Running Coach Expert Interview. 12 February 2021. Note that the actual distance you use can vary, as long as you’re sure of how long it is. You might plot a route that’s 0.5–1 mile (0.80–1.61 km) long, if you like."

[9] X Research source Note that your stride length while walking is different from your stride length while running, so stick to just one or the other for the full distance, depending on which you want to find. For instance, it may take you 112 steps to walk 100 metres (330 ft), or 2,000 steps to cover 1 mile (1.6 km).
