      "content": "Organize by deck boxes. This system works well if you are still building your collection and most of your cards are collected into decks. Simply place your cards into an empty deck box and place the box somewhere convenient, like on a shelf or in your closet. Since you've likely started to change your decks to be stronger when playing, you may want to name or label your decks so you know exactly what each box contains. For example, you might put a piece of tape on a box and write on the tape, \"Psychic Pokémon Deck.\""

      "content": "Use a binder . [1] X Research source There are many card collecting games similar to the Pokémon TCG (trading card game). These have frequently made use of binders, and this method of organization might be right for you. This format will allow a clear view of your cards and easy access. It will also protect your cards from damage, like bending and mold. These trading card binders are often filled with plastic inserts which have pockets for your cards. You can buy inserts like this from your local board game/hobby store. You might also make use of tabs to help you easily navigate your binder. Binder tabs can be bought at most office supply stores. You can make your own simple tab by fastening a piece of tape to the front and back of your plastic insert, allowing some extra tape to stick out from your binder. Then write the heading on your tab, for example, you might write, \"Type: Grass.\""

A card catalog is usually a large, wooden piece of furniture filled with narrow drawers into which you can put cards. [2] X Research source [3] X Research source You can find card catalogs at flea markets, garage sales, eBay, CraigsList, and antique stores, though antique catalogs may be expensive. If you purchase your card catalog secondhand, you should inspect it carefully. Many of these are old, and you might have to spend some time or money restoring it to hold your cards safely and securely."

There are also larger boxes intended specifically for storing trading cards that you could easily use for your Pokémon cards.

Some examples of set symbols include a flower (Jungle set, #2), a hollow star (Neo Genesis set, #8), and the letter 'R' (Team Rocket set, #5). [5] X Research source Sets are usually released four times a year. If you have purchased cards from Pokémon International, or possess cards from this series, the set information will be located in lower right hand corner at the bottom of your card. These symbols can be small and easy to miss; look carefully!"

      "content": "Separate your cards by set symbol and number. It'll be easy for you to group all like symbol cards together, but for further organization you'll need to arrange by set number. Each set has a designated number of cards, and each card is numbered within its set. This will help you organize your cards with even greater precision. You may need to use an online card directory to determine each cards position in a set. Many online set directories will first require you to choose the set category (like Base, Aquapolis, and Jungle) before linking you to the card number directory. The base set of the first cards released in English do not have a symbol. You may want to gather these cards together and arrange them according to HP (hit points) or alphabetic order."

This indicates that the card is a promotional card, also referred to as a \"promo.\" These are frequently given as a bonus to players when they purchase a deck. Although promotional cards have no set number, you can still organize these according to card number or release date. You'll have to look up this information online, as there are many promo cards, each with a different number and release date. You should also keep an eye out for \"black star promos.\" These are extra special cards that are produced specifically for promotional events."

Now that your cards are organized by set, you can insert these into your storage container to complete your organization. If you are using a binder, make sure the card slots are big enough for your Pokémon cards. Some card binders are intended for smaller cards, and trying to fit your Pokémon cards in these might cause your cards to bend or otherwise deform. When organizing your cards by set, trust the set symbols and number, even if the Pokémon on the card appears to be the same. Charizard from the Dragon Frontiers set and Charizard from the Power Keepers set have different numbers, pictures, and abilities."

For example, if you are using box-sleeves, you might keep all your fire evolutions together and label the box \"Fire Types.\" If you've chosen to use a binder, you can create section dividers to keep types separate with tabs.

Even if you aren't a fan of the animated series or the Pokémon video games, you probably know that in the Pokémon universe trainers have a special device called a Pokédex. The Pokédex is a kind of Pokémon dictionary, and it lists a number for each Pokémon. [9] X Research source You can use this number to organize your Pokémon. In the Pokémon TCG, you can sometimes find the national number in the information below the picture of the Pokémon card or in the bottom left hand corner of the card.

You can group cards you have multiple copies of together, or if using a binder, you may be able to put duplicates into the same card pocket of your plastic insert. You should be aware that putting several cards in the same plastic pocket in your binder could cause damage to the card. If the condition of the card is important to you, you should never have more than one card per plastic card pocket in your binder.

To keep your rare cards visible, you could put your rare cards in a binder that has plastic inserts with pockets for your cards. To further protect rare cards, you might want to encase each in a special plastic card sleeve intended to keep rare cards pristine. These protectors will be 2.5 in. by 3.5 in. (64mm by 89mm) in size, and can be bought at your local hobby store."
