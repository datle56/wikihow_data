Monolids tend to be more common in people of East Asian descent. However, not all people of East Asian descent have monolids. Additionally, people of other ethnic backgrounds can have monolids.

      "content": "Hooded eyes have excess skin that covers the eyelid crease. According to Frost, having hooded eyes means your eyelid crease is partially or fully covered by excess skin below your eyebrow. The skin folds down onto your upper lash line, making your eyelid crease less visible. People with hooded eyes do have an eyelid crease, unlike people with monolids. Hooded eyes just mean that the crease is covered by skin. Celebrity examples : Sarah Snook, Samira Wiley, Barry Keoghan, Chris Hemsworth, Dua Lipa, Blake Lively"

      "content": "Monolids are a genetic trait. Monolids are a common eyelid shape that is primarily determined by your genes—it’s likely that someone in your family passed on their monolids to you. This eyelid shape tends to be more common in people who have East Asian ancestry, as nearly 50% of people of East Asian descent have monolids. [3] X Research source That means that nearly 50% of people who have East Asian ancestry do not have monolids and instead have double lids; both eyelid shapes are equally common. While monolids are more common in people of East Asian descent, they are not a uniquely East Asian trait. For instance, people with Nordic, Russian, Indigenous American, and Pacific Islander ancestry can have monolids. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Double lids are caused by genetics.",
      "content": "Double lids are caused by genetics. Like monolids, whether you have double lids simply comes down to your genes. Having a distinct crease between your eyelids is determined by your DNA and whether or not your ancestors had this eyelid shape. [5] X Research source Double lids are not unique to any ethnicity and are a common eyelid shape in most cultures around the world. Double lids are considered a dominant gene while monolids are considered recessive. So, if you have 1 parent with double lids and 1 with monolids, you’re more likely to have double lids.

For the most part, people are born with hooded eyes. However, they can develop from a few other factors, like: [7] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Aging : As you age, your skin loses its elasticity. So, the skin under your eyebrow might start to sag and hang over your eyelid crease. Fat distribution : Some people carry more fat around their eyelid area. So, if they gain weight, they might notice more skin folding onto their eyelid crease. Eye rubbing : Constantly rubbing the eyes can stretch and loosen the skin around your eyelids, causing it to hang over your crease."

Because this eye shape lacks a crease, you use different techniques to flatter monolids than to flatter double lids. Using these makeup tips can help open up your eyes and make them pop, or accentuate the alluring, sleepy look. For instance: Layer your eyeshadow vertically to define your eyes . First, apply lighter shades all over your lid and closer to your brow bone. Then, place mid-toned shades along the center of your lid. Focus darker shadows on your upper lash line. [8] X Research source Use liquid eyeliner to help prevent smudging . Smudging and transferring eyeliner onto your lids can be an issue with monolids, so use a pen eyeliner or liquid eyeliner. These eyeliners dry quickly and tend not to smudge. [9] X Research source Apply a thin line of eyeliner to open up your eyes . Aim to keep your eyeliner on the thinner rather than the thicker side to help your eyes appear larger and brighter. This still defines your eyes while helping to prevent any smudging. [10] X Research source Curl your lashes and apply mascara . Curling your lashes also helps to make your eyes pop. Simply use an eyelash curler and then sweep on your favorite mascara, brushing it from the base of your lashes to the tips."

[11] X Research source Apply highlight in the inner corners to make your eyes brighter . To help your eyes pop and appear bigger, dab a matte or shimmery shade in a very light color onto your inner corners. [12] X Research source Play around with different eyeliner looks to define your eyes . Most double lids look great with thin or thick eyeliner. For a more subtle look, keep your liner thin. For a more dramatic look, thicken up the line. Opt for a dramatic wing or subtle cat-eye, too."

To help open and brighten your eyes, concentrate lighter shades on the center of your lids. [13] X Research source Sweep darker shadows above your crease to define your eyes .

Harwood suggests using an eyeliner pen or liquid liner and keeping the eyeliner thin along your upper lash line. This defines your eyes and helps them appear wider. Brush your brows upwards to lift up your eye area . To give the appearance of a more lifted eye, comb your brows up. Simply set them with a bit of brow gel . [15] X Research source"

What’s considered conventionally beautiful is different in different places, though. For instance, in some East Asian countries, double lids are seen as a sign of attractiveness. Because of this, some people with monolids get treatments and surgeries to get double eyelids. [16] X Research source While getting double lids is a personal choice, it’s important to remember that monolids are beautiful and don’t mean anything negative about you. Beauty is entirely subjective and looks different to different people! There are medical reasons why people with monolids might want double eyelids. Monolids can sometimes interfere with vision or cause ptosis, which is when your upper eyelid droops over your eye.

In one method, they add sutures along your eyelid to mimic the look of a crease. In another method, they cut away excess skin on your eyelid and then close the incision. [20] X Research source Suture-only surgery is generally less invasive, takes quicker to heal, and does not create a scar. However, the results are often more subtle, and there’s a slight chance the sutures can become undone. The incision-based surgery is more invasive, takes longer to heal, and can leave a faint scar. However, this is a good option for people who have excess skin around their eyelids, or their eyelids are impacting their vision."
