      "content": "Red moon (full moon) cycle If you're aligned with the red moon cycle, you'll get your period when the moon is full and ovulate during the new moon. Historically, women in medicine and midwifery were the ones who followed the red moon cycle, which is now known as a cycle of healing and teaching. The energy of the full moon is full of vibrancy and creativity, so if you menstruate during this time you tend to be focused on teaching, creativity, community, self-actualization, and external growth.

      "content": "White moon (new moon) cycle If your period aligns with the white moon cycle, you'll go through menstruation during the new moon and ovulate during the full moon. This can be a time of reflection, introspection, and incredible intuition. If your cycle aligns with the white moon, you may be in the “Mother” phase of your life. The full moon is linked with fertility, and when you ovulate during this time, those fertile energies may become magnified. [2] X Research source Use your energy during this time to care for others, raise children, and develop new ideas. This cycle can also be an important reminder to take care of your mental health during this period. Withdraw into rest and focus inwards alongside the new moon."

      "title": "Pink moon cycle",
      "content": "Pink moon cycle During the pink moon cycle, your menstruation will happen as the moon waxes from the new moon to the full moon. Because the waxing moon phase marks a time of transition from darkness to light, the pink moon cycle might mean you are about to enter a transitional period of your life. As you transition from the spiritual realm to the physical realm, you might feel inspired to create and connect with others. Reflect on where the past has gotten you and embrace this period of strength and power. [3] X Research source This cycle can be a great opportunity to seek out self-growth. Pick up a new hobby, go out with friends, and focus on developing a positive social or professional space where you can thrive."

      "content": "Purple moon cycle During the purple moon cycle, you'll menstruate when the moon is waning, transitioning from the full moon to the new moon. Like the pink moon cycle, this cycle also represents a time of transition. However, in this cycle, you might move from reconciling with the physical world to the spiritual. This time could be an opportunity to release negative energy, recharge, and recover your strength for what lies ahead. [4] X Research source During this time, focus on rebuilding your energy. Take time to meditate, clean out your house, or watch your favorite movies. A great way to release bad energy is to write whatever you want to let go of on a piece of paper and burn or bury it. You can also think about what you want to let go of in meditation, then release the thought and replace it with something positive."

Although lunar cycles have been used by women for centuries to track their periods, some recent studies suggest that menstrual and lunar cycles may have become separated from each other over time because of light pollution. [9] X Research source One way you can sync your cycle with the moon is by making sure your bedroom is completely dark at night. Try using blackout curtains to shut out any light coming from outside. You can also limit your screentime to help reduce your body’s exposure to light. Research shows that exposing yourself to light, especially blue light, can throw your body’s biological clock out of sync.

[14] X Research source The full moon is used most during rituals because it is a time when the earth’s energy peaks. However, you can also use waning or waxing moons in rituals to reconnect with the light of the moon."
