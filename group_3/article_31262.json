      "content": "Consider factors like personality, heritage, and family traditions. If you’re a new grandmother choosing a nickname for your grandkids to call you, narrow down the list of possibilities by personalizing the options. Are there names related to your family’s background and heritage? Is there a name traditionally used for grandparents in the family? Alternatively, pick a name that you just feel is a good fit for your personality! If you’re choosing a name on behalf of your grandmother, you can still consider the same factors. For example, if a special nickname for grandmothers runs in the family, you could use that—or put a unique spin on it."

It’s pretty common for the grandma herself to pick a nickname for the grandkids to use—so if you’re in that position, take time to explore the options! For example, if the classic “grandma” makes you feel older than your years, you could go with something more playful and sassy. Once you pick something you like, let everyone else know!"

Get an idea of the type of name she likes (or doesn’t like) and go from there. And, if you’re figuring out names for multiple sets of grandparents (or step-grandparents), you can brainstorm pairs of names for each couple, too. For example, you might pick “Mammy” and “Poppy” for one pair of grandparents and “Granna” and “Gramps” for another."

After all, young kids will probably pronounce whatever nickname you choose a little differently, at least for the first few years of life. That’s why simple is better—but it’s ultimately not that big a deal. After all, kids can learn to pronounce any name in time! So, pick something you genuinely want to be called (or something grandma actually likes)."
