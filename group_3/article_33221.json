Your team will toss batons to try and knock over the kubbs on the opposing team’s side of the field. If you’re able to knock over all of the other team’s kubbs followed by the king piece in the middle of the field, then you win the game. [1] X Research source"

Find a flat rectangular area outside and measure out the size of the field, pushing the stakes into the ground at the corners. The short ends of the field are known as the baselines and the longer edges are known as the sidelines . [2] X Research source Some Kubb sets come with string or rope to loop around the stakes and clearly mark the edges of the field. Variation: If you’re playing with kids or want an easier game, make the field 6 by 4 metres (6.6 yd × 4.4 yd) instead. [3] X Research source"

Leave about 30 centimetres (0.98 ft) of space between the kubbs and the corner stakes.

Find the middle of the field and set the king vertically so the crown is pointing up. The king sits on the centerline that runs parallel to the baselines and splits the field into 2 halves. One half of the field belongs to Team A and the other half belongs to Team B."

The chosen players each take 1 of the wooden batons and stand behind the baseline on their side of the field. At the same time, each player tosses the baton with an underhand throw toward the king. The team with the player who threw the baton closest to the king without knocking it over becomes Team A and attacks first. The other team becomes Team B.

Then, Team A throws 1 baton at a time towards the base kubbs on Team B’s side of the field. [7] X Research source Hold the baton by one end when you throw it so it spins vertically end-over-end. Throwing a baton so it spins horizontally like a helicopter blade is not allowed. If you’re playing a 1-vs-1 game of Kubb, you get to throw all of the batons. If you have multiple people on your team, try to split the batons evenly between the players so everyone gets a chance to throw one."

If Team A knocked down any kubbs during their turn, Team B picks up the ones that fell over and leaves any that are still standing. Players on Team B stand behind their baseline and take turns tossing the kubbs onto Team A’s side of the field with an underhand throw. [8] X Research source Players have to knock down the kubbs that they just threw, so try to land them in a spot you think will be easy to hit with batons later on. If a kubb goes out of bounds or doesn’t cross the centerline, players get one more chance to throw it in bounds. If it still lands on the wrong side of the field or out of bounds, it becomes a penalty kubb and Team A can place it wherever they want on their side of the field."

They can choose to tip the kubb onto either end as long as it stays in bounds. The kubbs that are in the field instead of on the baseline are now called field kubbs . [9] X Research source If a kubb hits another one already in the field when it’s thrown, stand both of them up where they come to rest. If a thrown kubb knocks over a base kubb, return the base kubb to its original position standing up."

Then the players try to hit the kubbs that are still on the baseline.

Players can stand anywhere on the field behind the temporary baseline when they’re throwing batons for the turn. [11] X Research source You’ll only use the temporary baseline when you throw your batons. When you toss kubbs to the other side, stand behind the baseline marked by the stakes. Temporary baselines may change each turn as players knock down field kubbs."

[12] X Research source If a team knocks the king over at any other point in the game, they automatically lose, so be careful as you throw kubbs or batons. Players need to stand behind the baseline between the stakes any time they throw batons at the king, even if there’s a field kubb standing up on their side of the field."

When the other team stands the kubbs up, there won’t be a lot of distance between them and you may be able to knock multiple over with a single baton. Knocking over multiple kubbs at a time helps you save batons so you have more chances to throw them at the king. For example, if a team only has 3 field kubbs and you knock them all down with 1 baton, you have 5 batons left for throwing at the king and possibly winning the game."

You don’t want the other team to have an advantage when they’re throwing their batons, so knocking the closest kubbs down pushes back their temporary baseline. [14] X Research source Try landing kubbs close to the centerline when you toss them, but be careful. If you can’t knock them down on your turn, the other team will be really close when they throw to your side of the field."

You could place the penalty kubb directly behind the king, back near the baseline, or on a sideline away from other kubbs. [15] X Research source Anytime you place a penalty kubb, you must position it at least one baton-length away from the corner stakes or king."
