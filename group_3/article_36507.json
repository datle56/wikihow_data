      "content": "Tooth whitening strips As one of the most popular at-home methods for removing tooth stains, tooth whitening strips use strips of pre-applied whitening gel to easily apply the product to your teeth. To use these strips, you simply stick them onto your teeth and follow package instructions to know how long to leave them. [2] X Research source As the strips sit on your teeth, the gel will work to bleach out any stains and whiten the overall look of your teeth. Be mindful that whitening strips can cause tooth sensitivity, so it’s best to discuss treatment with your dentist before using the strips. Also, be careful to follow package directions exactly and avoid applying the strips over your gum line, which may cause irritation."

      "content": "Whitening pens Whitening pens are an easy-to-use and effective solution for people on the go. The whitening pen contains a bleaching gel that you brush onto your teeth in a thin layer, giving you a lot more control and precision over where the gel ends up. Therefore, it can be easier to avoid sensitive gum tissue or any potentially sensitive teeth.

      "content": "Tooth whitening gels and trays Tooth whitening gels contain bleaching agents with a peroxide-based formula. To use these gels, you fill a mouth-shaped tray with the product and then place it over your teeth—being cautious to avoid contact between the gel and your gum tissue. [4] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source This method for removing tooth stains is considered more effective than whitening toothpaste because the gel contains higher amounts of peroxide. Some tooth whitening kits also come with LED light devices to intensify the whitening effect on your teeth. Tooth whitening gels can be bought over-the-counter, but you can also ask your dentist if they offer services to create a custom tray that’s fitted to your teeth. Custom trays are thought to be more effective and safer since they fit your teeth exactly and better protect your sensitive gums."

A dentist’s office is more equipped to remove deep stains from your teeth, using stronger products and more advanced technology than you can use at home. Plus, you don’t have to worry about harming your gums or teeth with the help of a professional. [5] X Research source However, whitening discolored teeth at the dentist can be more expensive than over-the-counter or at-home remedies. Talk to your regular dentist first, and then check with local dentistry schools and low-cost dental clinics to see if they offer well-reviewed whitening services."

Some people believe that rubbing citrus or banana peels onto your teeth will whiten them because they often contain the compound d-limonene or citric acid.

There is no scientific research to support the effectiveness of fruit peels in removing stains from teeth. A 2017 study had varying results in the use of orange peel as a teeth whitener. However, be cautious with this method as the fruit is acidic and may erode your enamel. If you attempt this method and notice your teeth becoming more sensitive, stop immediately."

Open a capsule of activated charcoal and empty the contents onto your toothbrush, then gently brush your teeth for two minutes. Spit out the charcoal into a nearby sink and rinse your mouth thoroughly. If your teeth are sensitive, dab the activated charcoal onto your teeth and let it sit for two minutes without brushing. Rinse the charcoal out, and then brush your teeth. Alternatively, you can make an activated charcoal mouthwash by mixing the charcoal with a small amount of water. Swish the mouthwash solution for 2 minutes, then spit it out and rinse your mouth thoroughly. There is a lack of evidence to show that activated charcoal is effective for teeth whitening. A 2019 study found it to be effective but not as effective as other whitening toothpaste. Other research, however, warns against the use of activated charcoal as it can be abrasive on teeth and even lead to a loss of tooth structure, actually increasing the yellow look of your teeth.

On top of this daily habit, try the following tips to prevent stained or yellowed teeth : [18] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Rinse your mouth with water after drinking dark beverages like tea, coffee, wine, or soda. Drink dark beverages through a straw and only consume them at mealtimes so that your teeth are exposed for a shorter length of time. Add milk or cream to your tea and coffee to lighten the drinks and potentially neutralize their acids. Eat staining foods (like blueberries or chocolate) all at one time rather than snacking on them throughout the day. Rinse your teeth with water before brushing so that acids from food and drink are washed off and less likely to cause enamel erosion. Use a high-quality electric toothbrush to brush your teeth twice daily."
