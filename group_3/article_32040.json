Take the left side of the shirt and fold it towards the centre. Once centred, fold the sleeve back onto the folded shirt portion. Then, do the same to the other side so that the shirt is no thicker than 6 inches (15 cm) wide. Take the collar of the shirt and start rolling it up as tight as you can until it's completely rolled. Holding the finished roll, use the inverted section of the bottom of the shirt to secure the roll of the shirt.
