    {
      "title": "Get specific about what you want.",
      "content": "Get specific about what you want. “Be clear and concise about what you want,” instructs McVey. “Whatever you’re creating, you want to be specific. Use positive, clear wording and keep it simple, or at least write in simple sentences…If you ask for Mr. Right, you might get Mr. Wright! So, the more specific you are, the better [your manifestation] is.” Who do you want to text you ? Why exactly do you need a text from them? What do you want the message to say? The more specific your want or goal, the faster the universe will bring it to you. [1] X Research source For example: “I want my boss to text me and say I have tomorrow off so I can go to the beach with my friends.” “I want my ex to text me and say he misses me so that we can get back together.” “I want Becca to text me and suggest a spot for our second date because it’ll mean she’s into me.”"

      "title": "Write down your exact desires.",
      "content": "Write down your exact desires. Handwriting your intentions is a powerful way to put your desire out there. The universe responds positively to acts of creation, so grab a pen and paper and physically write down your manifestation . “Write down exactly what you want and…all the different ways you think it could come to you,” says McVey. Draft the exact message you want to receive, who it’s from, and when and why you want it. McVey also recommends to always “add the date that you’re writing [the manifestation] and always use some type of title…And I wouldn’t type it, I would absolutely write it” by hand.” Don’t worry about your message being embarrassing or cheesy. No one will see it but you! Consider “putting your paper somewhere safe or special…like a manifesting notebook,” suggests McVey."

      "title": "Send a text to yourself.",
      "content": "Send a text to yourself. Save your own phone number under the name of the person you want to text you. Type out the exact message you want to get and then send it to yourself. Internalize the joy you feel when you see their name pop up on your screen so you can meditate on it later. [2] X Research source Take a mental picture of what your screen looks like with a message from them. This image will strengthen your visualization . This method trains you to expect a message from this person. When you expect and believe something good will happen, the universe will give it to you."

      "title": "Try at least one popular manifestation method, like visualization.",
      "content": "Try at least one popular manifestation method, like visualization. To perform phone visualization, close your eyes, take a few deep breaths , and meditate on the text. See the person sending it, picture your screen lighting up with a notification, and hear your ringtone or feel your phone vibrate. Feel the happiness or excitement of getting a good news text or a message from your crush. Pair this visualization with one or more of the following manifestation techniques: [3] X Research source The 369 Method: Handwrite your intent 3 times in the morning, 6 times in the afternoon, and 9 times before bed. The Pillow Method: Read your handwritten intention to yourself and meditate on it for a few minutes at night, and then put it under your pillow while you sleep. The Whisper Method: Imagine yourself walking up to the person you want a text from and picture them clearly with their phone in their hand. See yourself whispering “You’re going to text me” into their ear and watching them type out a message. The Dreamcatcher Method: Focus your intentions into the dreamcatcher and visualize it as you imagine your desired outcome. Place the dreamcatcher next to your bed so you can manifest your goals overnight . The Rubber Band Method: Wrap a rubber band around your index finger as you meditate on your desired outcome and leave it there until you get your text message. The Sticker Method: Write out your intention on a sticky note, then place it somewhere hidden and distraction-free—like the bottom of your coffee mug or the inside of your purse."

      "title": "Let go of any limiting beliefs with positive affirmations.",
      "content": "Let go of any limiting beliefs with positive affirmations. In order for your manifestation to come true, you must sincerely believe that it will. Positive affirmations are a great way to dismiss any doubts or insecurities and usher in good vibes for your manifestation. Identify the exact insecurities you’re feeling—maybe you’re convinced no one wants to talk to you, or that your crush will never see you as more than a friend. Then, speak affirmations that oppose these thoughts out loud and in the present tense, like in these examples: [4] X Research source “I deserve to hear from the people I care about.” “I create meaningful relationships with people who care about me.” “I’m open to getting a text from my crush.” “I have great communication skills.” “My friends want to talk to me.”"

      "title": "Put your phone down and let go of the outcome.",
      "content": "Put your phone down and let go of the outcome. After your manifestation ritual has been completed, it’s best to step away from your phone and let go of any worrying about the eventual outcome. The more you worry or obsess, the more you counteract the positive work you’ve done. Try to release your attachment to the result of your manifesting. Put away your phone, step outside, and do something you enjoy. [5] X Research source This doesn’t mean giving up, but rather allowing yourself to accept whatever the universe brings you and the feelings that it may evoke. Letting go creates space for the universe to work its magic, often bringing your desires to life in unexpected ways. This step is about trust: trust in the timing, the method, and the wisdom of the universe. Be patient while the universe works. You might not get the exact message you want in the exact timeframe you hoped for but trust that you’re being steered towards the greater good. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Take aligned action to make your goals more realistic. Manifestation requires action as well as thoughts, feelings, and beliefs. To improve the chances that your manifestation really works, take aligned actions to create conditions that are conducive to your intent becoming reality. For instance, you might make sure your phone is charged and on your person, engage in activities that put you in a positive headspace, and become emotionally available enough to handle the text message.

      "content": "Reassess your manifestation practice as needed. If weeks have gone by and there’s no text, revisit your original intention. Were you specific enough? Did you leave something out? Were you honest with yourself ? Edit or update your written text and use the new version for your visualizations going forward. [8] X Research source It’s possible self-doubt or insecurity is holding you back. Let go of these negative beliefs and focus on your positive affirmations if you feel this is the case.

      "content": "Manifestation combines thoughts and actions to achieve a desired goal. “Manifesting,” according to McVey, “is creating something and hopefully bringing it into our physical reality. So, manifestation is using our abilities, our power, or energy, and all the stuff that we do naturally to create what we want and bring it into fruition.” Whether or not manifestation is real (which hasn’t been proven, scientifically), the act of manifesting may help you assume more of a direct role in your own life and end up achieving goals and dreams that you wouldn’t have otherwise."

Your manifestation (and the amount of time it takes to take effect) may be affected by your belief in the manifestation, the clarity of your intention, and the timing of the universe.

Focus your energy on your intention and the positive spirit you bring to it, and you may be hearing from this certain someone for the first time in a while."

      "content": "Is it possible to manifest a text for someone else? In theory, you can manifest a text for someone else. However, it’s considered best to allow others to do their own manifesting and respect their right to free will. Even if you have the best of intentions, you never know how a certain outcome or decision will affect a person’s personal energy, life, and well-being. [11] X Research source"

      "content": "What if I manifest the text but the content isn't what I hoped for? You can manifest the receiving of a text from a specific person, but you have less control over the actual content or tone of the message. If the text message itself isn’t what you were hoping for, take it as an opportunity to reflect on your true desires and grow from this outcome. It may be time to reevaluate your communication or relationship with the person who texted you."

Manifestation may help to open up the communication between you and a partner, but the pair of you will have to do the rest of the work to fully reconcile. You’ll have to approach your renewed communication (thanks to manifesting) with a commitment to understanding each other and putting in the effort to mend and grow. [12] X Research source"
