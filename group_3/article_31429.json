      "content": "Cannabis affects your appearance and behavior in recognizable ways. If you can tell that you're high, it's likely that anyone around you can tell, too—or can at least tell that something's a little off. Bloodshot eyes that are extraordinarily sensitive to the light are one of the tell-tale signs that someone's been indulging in cannabis. Here are some other signs: [1] X Research source Slower reaction time Impaired hand/eye coordination Dry mouth Relaxed, ambivalent attitude"

      "content": "Take a quick shower to freshen up. A shower will not only get rid of any weed smell lingering on your skin and hair, but also might just sober you up a bit. Studies show that a cold shower can help reduce the psychoactive effects of THC, including anxiety, with one study in particular showing that the cold water has a grounding effect that can help break dissociative feelings you might have when you're high. [2] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source After your shower, you'll likely feel a little more alert and more comfortable moving around in the world, which is a big part of not looking high."

      "content": "Change clothes to get rid of the smell of weed. If you've got clean clothes handy, putting something on that doesn't smell like cannabis will go a long way toward helping you look less high. Even if you don't look particularly high, people are likely to assume you are if you smell like you just smoked up in the car on the way there. If you're at a friend's house and don't have a change of clothes handy, freshen up by washing your face and hands, then maybe spritz a little body spray or use some scented lotion to help mask the scent."

      "content": "Use eye drops or an ice pack to clear your eyes. If your eyes are bloodshot from smoking a little too much, a couple of drops of artificial tears might be all you need. Don't have any drops handy? Make a cool compress with a washcloth or hold an ice pack over your eyes for just a minute or two and you'll feel some relief. [3] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Opthamologists Professional medical organization focused on advocating for public health and supporting sight-related research Go to source Make sure to wrap ice or anything else that's frozen in a soft cloth—the extreme cold could burn the sensitive skin around your eyes very easily. Even though the bloodshot eyes you get from being high aren't the result of an outside irritant, any kind of eye drops should still be able to clear them up for you. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Protect your eyes with sunglasses. Marijuana makes your eyes more sensitive to light, which is great at night—a study even found that marijuana can improve night vision. But if it's the middle of the afternoon, you're going to be squinting a lot unless you put on some sunglasses. [5] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Opthamologists Professional medical organization focused on advocating for public health and supporting sight-related research Go to source Make sure you take your sunglasses off when you go indoors, or people will likely notice and they'll definitely think you've got something going on. Sunglasses can also help you if you have the tendency to zone out when you're high. Since people can't see your eyes, they won't realize that you're just staring off into the distance contemplating something very deep and meaningful."

      "content": "Have a quick meal. Marijuana definitely increases your appetite, and a lot of people feel like after they eat something they come down a little bit. It will definitely make you feel a little less high, which means you won't act as high. And if you don't act as high, you won't look as high. [6] X Research source Be careful when you're out in public, though. If you've got the munchies, eating might make you look even more high because of the way you're attacking those nachos. The act of eating is also a great distraction that will take your mind off of being high for a few minutes and give you something else to focus on."

A nice glass of ice water will do wonders for your cottonmouth and help you feel a little more alert. [7] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Smoking cannabis also has a dehydrating effect, so make sure you're drinking plenty of water both while you're smoking as well as after. Or why not try a fresh lemonade?

If you're feeling a bit anxious or overwhelmed because you're higher than you want to be, take a comfortable seat somewhere relatively quiet and turn your attention to your breath. Breathe deeply in through your nose, pause, then exhale slowly out your mouth. Repeat this for several minutes or until you start to feel more in control.

      "content": "Keep quiet and hang in the background. If it's cool for you to do so, just hang back and chill. People are a lot less likely to notice that you're high if you're not drawing a lot of attention to yourself. In fact, it might even be possible to just kind of blend into the background so nobody really notices you at all—then you don't have to worry about it. Do what you can to prepare in advance when you do have to speak so you can say it without sounding high. For example, you might practice your order while waiting for the server to come around to your table. If you're out in public, playing a game on your phone can serve as a distraction and will also help you hide your high because people will be less likely to interact with you if you seem occupied. Staying in the background will also help you keep a low profile if you get a fit of the giggles, which can be a dead giveaway that you're high."

According to a study published in the British Journal of Pharmacology, chemicals found in black peppercorns help reduce anxiety or clear the brain fog you might feel when you're high.

Just make a quick change when you're done smoking and you won't have to worry about any lingering smells in your clothing when you're out and about. Even if you just change shirts it'll make a big difference. If you look clean and well put together, people are usually going to be less likely to think you're high anyway.

[13] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Opthamologists Professional medical organization focused on advocating for public health and supporting sight-related research Go to source Sunglasses are pretty much going to cover your eyes completely, so you don't have to worry about that at all as long as you're going to be in a situation where it's appropriate to wear sunglasses all the time."

Plus, having a snack is a great way to take the edge off of your high so that you feel less anxious or paranoid and more comfortable with yourself. [15] X Research source It's always great to have a little variety as well. If you're headed to someone else's house to smoke, bring along something salty or savory as well as something sweet—you never know what you're going to be craving."

If you don't immediately have anywhere to go and you find that you're a little too high, it can feel wonderful to simply sleep it off. The effects typically only last 2 to 4 hours, so just put your favorite movie on and chill on the couch for a little while.
