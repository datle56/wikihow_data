      "title": "Cut back the plant by one third after it finishes flowering.",
      "content": "Cut back the plant by one third after it finishes flowering. Typically, the best time to do this is at the end of summer or in early autumn, based on when your plant stops flowering. Use pruning shears or loppers to remove about one third of your plant's total mass. This encourages the plant to grow new buds, so it can bloom beautifully the following season. Make your cuts at a 45-degree angle to minimally damage the plant. [1] X Research source If your plant is very small or does not grow quickly, it only requires a light pruning. You can snip around one fourth of the plant off rather than one third."

      "title": "Cut damaged flower stems to the ground for a thorough pruning.",
      "content": "Cut damaged flower stems to the ground for a thorough pruning. In addition to reducing the overall size of your plant, go around the plant and look for any browning areas or withered stems. Snip these stems off using your pruning shears, and make your cut at a 45-degree angle as close to the ground as you can. This way, your plant will grow fresh, healthy stems. [2] X Research source If you leave unhealthy stems, they will drain your plant's nutrients. To keep your plant healthy, it is best to get rid of any unsightly stems. Avoid cutting green shoots. These are alive and can still grow healthy buds."

      "title": "Trim back the leafy foliage to open up the middle of your plant.",
      "content": "Trim back the leafy foliage to open up the middle of your plant. If the middle of your kangaroo paw is very dense and congested, snip off some of the leaves using your pruning shears. Cut the leaves at the base of the plant at a slight angle. [3] X Research source Keeping the center open and airy helps the plant grow long stems and project outward."

    {
      "title": "Remove discolored tips from the end of the remaining leaves.",
      "content": "Remove discolored tips from the end of the remaining leaves. After you've pruned your kangaroo paw, go around the plant and snip off any brown or yellow ends. This ensures the plant conserves its nutrients so it can grow gorgeous flowers. [4] X Research source Make your snips with pruning shears or scissors."

      "title": "Cut the plant's stems completely to the ground to rejuvenate your plant.",
      "content": "Cut the plant's stems completely to the ground to rejuvenate your plant. If your plant is extremely overgrown or not looking healthy, you can revitalize it by pruning it to the ground. Use pruning shears or a hedge clipper to cut off the stems of the plant as close to the ground as you can. This sends the plant into dormancy through the colder season. As it starts to get warm, the plant grows new, healthy stems. [5] X Research source This is a good idea if your kangaroo paw has overgrown your garden bed or if the plant looks withered and sickly. If your kangaroo paws are in a pot rather than your garden, it is healthier for the plant to leave a few healthy stems if you can. That way, it can grow back faster."

    {
      "title": "Prune selectively through the summer and fall when your flowers fade.",
      "content": "Prune selectively through the summer and fall when your flowers fade. As you notice your flowers losing color or wilting, cut them off at the base of the plant. Make your snip at a 45-degree angle, and the stem will grow back healthy next year. [6] X Research source This way, your plant looks great in your garden or inside its pot."

    {
      "title": "Cut your kangaroo paws when the first flower opens.",
      "content": "Cut your kangaroo paws when the first flower opens. Kangaroo paws have many flowering buds lining the stems. If you want to display your flowers in a vase or bouquet, snip your stems when you see the first bud open into a flower. [7] X Research source This way, you can get the maximum display time for your flowers."
    },
    {
      "title": "Make your cut about halfway down the stem.",
      "content": "Make your cut about halfway down the stem. If you cut the stem about half way, the flower buds continue to develop where you made the cut. This promotes new growth quicker, so you'll have even more beautiful flowering stems. To cut, use pruning shears and snip the stem at a 45-degree angle. [8] X Research source"

      "title": "Cut 3-7 kangaroo paw stems to make a full bouquet.",
      "content": "Cut 3-7 kangaroo paw stems to make a full bouquet. If you want to make a gorgeous floral display, use a few kangaroo paw stems and a decorative vase. In addition, you can add other green accents or additional flowers to your bouquet. [9] X Research source This creates an attractive centerpiece, for example. You can place the centerpiece in your office, bathroom, living room, or kitchen."

      "content": "Put your kangaroo paws in a decorative vase full of water. Fill up a vase of your choosing about ⅔ full with cool water, and then place your kangaroo paws inside. Make sure each of your stems is submerged at the bottom. [10] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Cut the tips of the stems every day or every other day.",
      "content": "Cut the tips of the stems every day or every other day. Your cut flowers absorb water from the bottom of the stem. To keep the flower healthy, take them out of the vase, place them on a paper towel, and cut the end of the plant at an angle. Remove about 1 ⁄ 16 – 1 ⁄ 8 in (0.16–0.32 cm) of the stem. [11] X Research source This extends the vase life of your kangaroo paws. Cut your stems under flowing water. This will help prevent air from getting drawn up into the stem and allow the stems to absorb water more easily."

      "title": "Change the water in your vase when you snip the stems.",
      "content": "Change the water in your vase when you snip the stems. Before you snip your stems, pour out the water and fill up your vase about two thirds of the way full with fresh water. If there are any leaves in the vase, take them out and throw them away. [12] X Research source With proper watering, your kangaroo paws should last in a vase for 3-5 days."
