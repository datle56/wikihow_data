Many excellent databases contain peer-reviewed and academic data that aren't fully searchable on Google or Bing, including USA.gov - Find information about government jobs, loans, grants, taxes, and more. Most of this information is not available when you search Google, but it is invaluable if you need information about local, federal, state, or tribal government. DOAJ - Find all the public academic journals you want with this database. There are over 20,000 journals spanning lots of different subjects! Although you can use Google Scholar to find some free journals, you won't be able to discover everything that the DOAJ offers. Project Muse - Find and read peer-reviewed academic journal articles and e-books about the humanities. Voice of the Shuttle - Find more humanities-focused resources curated by humans who share helpful and interesting Deep Web content. Library of Congress's Digital Collections - Find hundreds of manuscripts, photos, videos, articles, and other historical information you won't find in Google. National Archives Catalog search - Find multiple archives, including documents uploaded by citizen archivists. [1] X Research source https://veridiansoftware.com/collections/ - This is a great database for researchers, historians, and students. It offers a great selection of all the historical newspapers from all over the world. Most of these newspapers aren't available from a simple Google search; you need to use this database to read them."
