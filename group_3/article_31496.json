      "title": "Tell them that this failure does not define them.",
      "content": "Tell them that this failure does not define them. A lot of people who fail an exam might think that failing an exam makes them a failure at life. Tell them it was one exam, in one class. It doesn’t mean that they are a failure at life, and it doesn’t even mean they can’t be successful in the rest of the course. [1] X Research source You can say \"I know it feels like you'll never get past this, but you will. Failing this one test doesn't mean that you're a failure. It just means you hit a bump in the road.\""

    {
      "title": "Let them vent.",
      "content": "Let them vent. Sometimes they’ll just need to be upset, or complain about the exam or the class. That’s okay! Listen quietly, letting them get all of their emotions out about the failure. [2] X Trustworthy Source Greater Good Magazine Journal published by UC Berkeley's Greater Good Science Center, which uses scientific research to promote happier living Go to source Ask them to tell you how they feel, and let them talk as long as they need to. You can say something like \"Tell me how you're feeling about it. I'm here to listen as long as you need me.\""

    {
      "title": "Offer them positive examples.",
      "content": "Offer them positive examples. Right after you’ve failed an exam, it’s easy to feel like you’ll never do anything well again. If you know someone who has failed the same test or exam (or a similar one), but then became successful, tell them about it! It can remind them that good things will happen again, too. [3] X Research source For example, say something like \"You know how everyone talks about how John is the most successful alumnus we've got? Well, he failed this exact same exam. And he still did great!\""

      "title": "Suggest that they take a break.",
      "content": "Suggest that they take a break. After failing a test, some people feel like they have to immediately begin studying again. Instead, suggest that they take a bit of a break, even if it’s just for a day. Suggest they take a walk outside, or even focus on chores at home. A break can be good for their mental health. [4] X Research source Say something like, \"How about we go for a walk? It'll get your mind off of things and let you recharge a little bit.\""

    {
      "title": "Remind them that everyone fails at some point.",
      "content": "Remind them that everyone fails at some point. Failing an exam might be especially hard for someone who has never failed one before. Remind them that everyone fails at some point, even if they don’t talk about it. They’re only human, and humans fail! [5] X Research source You can say something like \"Everyone fails. There's people in this class who have failed an exam. It happens to everyone at some point, and you can get through it!\""

      "title": "Don’t make fun of them.",
      "content": "Don’t make fun of them. Failing a test can be a seriously demoralizing thing. And even if they seem okay about it, they might be hiding how they really feel. Don’t make fun of them for failing, or compare their score to yours. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Help them figure out new ways to study.",
      "content": "Help them figure out new ways to study . Ask how long they studied, how often they took notes in class, and if they ever felt like they weren’t doing enough. Help them look up studying strategies on websites like Princeton Review, and select strategies they haven't tried before. Using a new strategy can yield different results. [7] X Research source Share strategies that you find successful. For instance, if you always use flashcards, you can show them how you organize your notes into flashcards. Reader Poll: We asked 789 wikiHow readers if they thought taking notes leads to better grades, and 79% of them said Yes. [Take Poll] So, that's a good place to start."

      "title": "Suggest they set a time limit on their reaction.",
      "content": "Suggest they set a time limit on their reaction. It can be really easy to obsess over a failure for days or even weeks. Suggest they give themselves a certain amount of time – say, 24 hours – to react however they want. Then suggest that once that timeframe is over, they focus on moving forward. [8] X Research source"

      "title": "Help them create a new study space.",
      "content": "Help them create a new study space. Ask them where they study. If it’s usually somewhere loud, with lots of distractions, offer to help them create a new space. Choose a quiet corner of their home to set up a desk and chair. Or help them scope out quiet coffee shops. [9] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Suggest a tutor.",
      "content": "Suggest a tutor. Some people simply need help learning how to study or learning certain material, and that’s okay. Suggest to the person who has failed that a tutor might give them the boost they need. [10] X Research source You can suggest they look for tutor services at their school, or through websites for companies like Sylvan Learning."

      "title": "Encourage them to contact their professor right away.",
      "content": "Encourage them to contact their professor right away. If the test they've failed might prevent them from passing the class or from graduating, they need to talk with their instructor right away. Your friend might feel terrible about even talking about their failure, but it's important to talk to the people who can make a difference as soon as possible. [11] X Trustworthy Source Association for Psychological Science Nonprofit organization devoted promoting trustworthy research and education in the psychological sciences Go to source For example, they can say something like \"Dr. Smith, I'd really like to meet with you to talk about this failed exam.

      "content": "Help them figure out how to articulate their concern. Going to a professor and just saying \"You failed me and now I can't graduate\" probably won't get your friend anywhere. Instead, pretend you're the professor and let your friend practice making their case to you. [12] X Trustworthy Source Association for Psychological Science Nonprofit organization devoted promoting trustworthy research and education in the psychological sciences Go to source They can say things like, \"I'm really concerned about this grade because it could prevent me from graduating. I went over my notes and reading and I didn't see the material from the test covered there anywhere.\" Or they can say \"I feel I adequately answered the essay question. I've marked my essay in these 3 places that show my direct answers and I was hoping we could go over them and discuss my grade.\""

      "title": "Tell them to share any mitigating circumstances with their professor.",
      "content": "Tell them to share any mitigating circumstances with their professor. If your friend had a migraine, or just got bad news from home, or was sick, they probably weren't at their best for the test. They should share that information with their teacher while they're discussing their failure. [13] X Trustworthy Source Association for Psychological Science Nonprofit organization devoted promoting trustworthy research and education in the psychological sciences Go to source For example, they could say something like, \"I didn't say anything on the day of the exam because it felt like an excuse, but I was really sick and I think that affected my performance.\""

      "title": "Encourage them to ask the professor for another try.",
      "content": "Encourage them to ask the professor for another try. Some instructors have rigid rules regarding retakes, but if your friend has demonstrated really serious issues, their instructor might relent. They can ask for a retake or for any possible extra credit. [14] X Research source For example, they can say something like, \"Would you allow me to retake this exam?\" or \"Is there any extra credit I can do to make up some of the points I lost? I'm really worried about its effect on my ability to graduate.\""

      "content": "Tell them to stay calm. In a situation where a failing grade on one assignment might derail your friend's whole college experience, they might feel angry or want to say mean things to their professor. Encourage them to stay calm and polite during their meeting. [15] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Practicing the conversation they'll have with their professor can help them stay calm.
