      "content": "Improve your leg flexibility. Stretch for at least 10 minutes each day â€“ you can do this in one large chunk, or in several separate sections. [1] X Research source Some people may need more time, especially if they have a larger midsection or less lower back flexibility, so adjust as needed. Stretch after a physical activity like dancing or running. The more flexible you are, the easier it will be to put your legs behind your head. Start the first day with a 10-second front lunge on both feet. Put one foot out and kneel with your back leg out. Push your hips forward, switch legs, and repeat. Do a 10-second butterfly stretch. Sit on the floor or ground and bring both of your feet together. Then, pull your feet towards your body, and bring your head as close to your toes as possible. Perform a 20-second star-watching stretch. Kneel with your rear off of your feet. Reach upward and backward, and try to touch your toes. Push your torso up and look at the ceiling or sky. Increase your time 5 seconds everyday."
