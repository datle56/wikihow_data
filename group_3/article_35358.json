Epididymitis most commonly occurs when severe or untreated chlamydia spreads from the urethra to the epididymis and causes another infection.

Not all men will experience discharge, but it is one of the most common signs of chlamydia in men who show symptoms. [6] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source The discharge may not “flow” out of the penis on its own and might only be visible if it’s squeezed out. Discharge from chlamydia is usually less profuse and thick than from gonorrhea. Recognizing gonorrhea symptoms can be tricky since they’re similar to those of chlamydia.

This could indicate you’ve developed an infection of the urethra, known as urethritis, from your chlamydia. [8] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source Urethritis might also be called non-gonococcal urethritis, which means it was caused by something other than gonorrhea."

Get a full STI screening, including for chlamydia, at least once a year (or more often if you regularly have multiple sexual partners). Also test after you have unprotected sex, have sex with a new partner, or experience any chlamydia-related symptoms after sex. [17] X Research source Regular testing is the only way to know for sure whether you have chlamydia or not since it’s asymptomatic most of the time. Chlamydia can be asymptomatic for both men and women, making it easy to spread without knowing. It’s sometimes called the “silent infection.” [18] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Men who present chlamydia symptoms can have the infection for weeks before any noticeable signs appear."

Your doctor may prescribe you antibiotics before the results are back as a precaution. If you don’t have a doctor or insurance, visit local clinics or a sexual health agency like Planned Parenthood for free testing or sliding scale payment.

Follow your doctor’s instructions and take your antibiotics as prescribed—some treatments involve one large dose, while others require multiple pills taken over 7-10 days or more. Your treatment may also include antibiotics for gonorrhea, since the symptoms are very similar and it’s common to have both STIs at once. [21] X Research source When you take your medication correctly, most chlamydia infections clear up within a week or two. Antibiotics for chlamydia are usually oral medications like azithromycin or doxycycline."

Make sure it fits snuggly over your penis and check it throughout sex to make sure it hasn’t broken. [23] X Trustworthy Source MedlinePlus Collection of medical information sourced from the US National Library of Medicine Go to source If you or your partner is allergic to latex, use polyurethane condoms instead. To prevent oral transmission, use a dental dam during oral sex to keep chlamydia bacteria from entering the throat from the vagina or anus. Be open with your sexual partners about your STI status, and ask them about theirs. Good communication about sexual health can prevent transmission. The only surefire way to prevent chlamydia is to abstain from all vaginal, anal, or oral sex."
