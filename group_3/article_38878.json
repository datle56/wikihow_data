      "content": "Enter the search query that you want to monitor. You will see an overview of the types of results you will receive beneath the search box. If the results don't look exactly like what you want, try some of these searching tips. Using Quotes: Use quotes to search for whole phrases instead of individual words. For example, if you want to get results about a movie titled, The Boy in the House, enclose it with quotes. Be sure that the words within the quotes are in the correct order. If you use quotes, the results will only include the exact phrase Using the minus symbol: Use the minus symbol to exclude certain words from your search result. This is especially helpful if you need to remove words from a search term with multiple meanings. If you want to get alerts about the Puma clothing brand but not the animal, enter in -animal to exclude all results about the puma animal. If you want to exclude results from a specific site, enter in -site: sitename . Using an asterisk: Use the asterisk as a placeholder for unknown words. For example, if you wish to find results about different things a city is doing to its citizens, you could enter in this search: \"New York * citizens\" . Any phrase that starts with New York and ends with citizens will be returned. Using OR operator: Use the word, OR to get results that contain any one of your search terms. For example, if you searched, Australia OR prison OR systems , you would get results with pages that may only include one of the search words."
