      "content": "Understand the enemy. Whether you rubbed oil or grease on your interior ultimately doesn’t matter for cleanup purposes. Here’s why: Oils are defined as any compounds that are insoluble in water, soluble in organic solvents (non-polar things like gasoline), and liquid at room temperature. [1] X Research source Grease, on the other hand, is simply an oil that has additives to make it semi-solid (kind of like Jell-O) at room temperature. These additives are solid and do not absorb into the surfaces inside your car. [2] X Research source This means that, once you scrape off any excess contaminants from the surface of your interior, the stain left behind is an oil stain. Cleaning oil from cloth seats requires the same process you would use to clean it from carpet. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Steam the stained area.",
      "content": "Steam the stained area. If a degreaser didn’t knock out the stain, you may need to use steam to coax it out. The steam will heat the fibers of your carpet and open up any pores in the fiber. This allows the carpet to “release” any trapped oil and gives you the chance to soak it up. You can use a traditional steam cleaner to do this job. If you do not have a steam cleaner, you can place a brown paper bag over the stain to absorb the oils. Then, apply steam by putting a clothing iron on top of the bag to create the heat and steam to free the oils."
