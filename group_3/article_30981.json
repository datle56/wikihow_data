      "content": "Determine your skin's undertones and select foundations that match. Find your undertones by looking at the veins in your wrist under natural light. If they are green, you have warm undertones. If they are blue or purple, you have cool undertones. If you can’t tell the difference or they look green and blue, you probably have neutral undertones. [1] X Research source If you have neutral undertones, you can pull off either warm or cool shades of foundation. You can mix warm and cool toned foundation if you want a little bit of both."

      "title": "Go with foundations that have the same finish.",
      "content": "Go with foundations that have the same finish. Matte and dewy finishes don’t mix well together since one is more oily than the other. As you pick out your foundation, try to choose ones that have similar formulas to avoid uneven mixes. [2] X Research source Matte finishes are great if you have oily skin since they will tamp down on shine. Dewy finishes are nice if you have dry or flaky skin since they can bring some moisture back into your face."

      "title": "Pick out foundations that both have the same coverage.",
      "content": "Pick out foundations that both have the same coverage. Some foundations are great for a full-coverage glam look, while others give more of a subtle, even skin tone. You can choose between light, medium, and full-coverage foundations to find one that’s right for you. Make sure each foundation you buy is the same coverage to avoid splotchy-looking foundation. [3] X Research source If you aren’t a fan of full-coverage liquid foundation, you can choose a BB cream for a lighter feel."

      "content": "Buy a liquid or cream foundation instead of a powder or stick. Although powder and stick foundations are great, they don’t mix well. Stick to liquid or cream foundation if you want to mix yours, and choose powder or stick foundation to add color to your face afterward if you need to. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Purchase a light foundation for the winter and a dark one for summer. Make sure they both have the same undertones as your skin, but make the lighter one 1 to 2 shades lighter than the darker one. Depending on how tan you get in the summer, you may need an even wider range of shades. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Correct redness or dark spots with green or orange pigments. Put 1 to 2 drops of green color-correcting fluid into your foundation to neutralize any redness or blemishes you may have. Add 1 to 2 drops of orange color-correcting fluid into your foundation to cover up any sun spots or dark areas.

Then, apply a thin layer of moisturizer all over and let it dry for about 15 minutes before you put on your foundation. [7] X Research source Starting with a clean base will give you more of an even coverage and make you less prone to breakouts."

Move outwards toward your hairline and jawline in small, circular motions for the best coverage. [9] X Research source Don’t go all the way up to your hairline or jawline just yet, but take the foundation up as far as it will go."

If it’s the winter, put 2 to 3 dots of the dark foundation on either side of your face to start. If it’s the summer, go with 4 or 5 on each side of your face. [10] X Research source You can always add more dark foundation, but you can’t take it off that easily."

Add about the same amount of fragrance-free face lotion to the foundation, then mix them with a stiff makeup brush.

You can also put a few pigment drops in a lighter coverage foundation to make it more full coverage. [13] X Research source"

Use much more of the dark foundation that you have when your skin is more tan. [15] X Research source If you haven’t been out in the sun for very long, you might not need to go as dark.

Use a brush instead of your finger so you don’t add any oil or dirt to the mix. [17] X Research source A stiff makeup brush will work better than a fluffy one. Make sure your makeup brush is clean before you use it to mix so it doesn’t add in any residual foundation."

See if the shade is close to what your neck is right now. [18] X Research source Your face may be lighter than your neck if you’ve been wearing foundation when you go outside. That’s why it’s important to match the color to your neck, not your face."
