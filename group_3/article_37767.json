      "content": "Friends to Lovers The friends-to-lovers trope is one of the most common and beloved—everyone loves the idea of falling in love with someone who’s like a best friend, after all! In these stories, two people often have a friendly or BFF-style relationship before one (or both) of them begin to realize that their relationship may be something more.

      "title": "Enemies to Lovers",
      "content": "Enemies to Lovers On the opposite side of the spectrum from friends to lovers but equally popular is enemies to lovers, where two seemingly incompatible or rival-type people end up together. These “enemies” often start the story by constantly frustrating each other or being at each other's throats. It’s only a matter of time, however, until they realize that their emotions for each other run far beyond anger.

      "title": "Forbidden Love",
      "content": "Forbidden Love Forbidden Love (or star-crossed lovers) is one of the most iconic and long-running tropes— Romeo and Juliet ring a bell for anyone? For whatever reason, the two people in this story aren’t encouraged or allowed to be with one another. Maybe they’re from feuding families, maybe one’s a royal while the other’s a commoner, or maybe their same-sex relationship isn’t approved by those around them.

      "title": "Secrets or Secret Identities",
      "content": "Secrets or Secret Identities As a trope, “secrets” can encompass a lot of different situations and scenarios for a pair of potential lovers. In a majority of these ~secretive~ stories, one character in the romance has a secret they’re trying to keep hidden—usually related to their identity or past. Sometimes, these characters are hiding their secret on purpose, while other stories may have them forgetting a key part of their past due to amnesia or another outside force.

      "title": "Betting",
      "content": "Betting One character makes a bet that they can seduce or otherwise “get with” another character. They may have made that bet with a friend of theirs, and they usually don’t (initially) care about the feelings of the person that they’re betting. As they get closer to them however, they start to develop true feelings—and the main conflict usually comes when the object of their affections learns of the bet.

      "title": "Forced Proximity",
      "content": "Forced Proximity Forced proximity is a very popular trope that shows two characters who are forced to be near each other for whatever reason. On the more likely end, they could’ve been assigned to partner on a project for school or walk. Maybe they’re sitting next to each other on a plane, or they’re trapped in an elevator together. Whatever the particular situation, the pair should be stuck together until they start to feel the sparks fly.

    {
      "title": "Best Friend’s Sibling",
      "content": "Best Friend’s Sibling This trope is similar to forbidden love…or it can at least often end up there. Basically, the protagonist falls in love with their best friend’s brother or sister, often followed by a period of denial or a feeling that their friend wouldn’t approve or be happy about the situation. Ultimately, of course, they give in to the temptation! The BFF’s sibling could also be swapped out for their partner, ex, or widow. Examples: The Silent Waters by Brittany C. Cherry (Maggie & Brooks), The Edge of Seventeen (Krista & Darian), Love, Victor (Pilar & Felix). Related Sub-Tropes: Best friend’s lover Best friend’s ex Best friend’s widow"

      "title": "Second Chance",
      "content": "Second Chance A “second chance at romance” trope presents two ex-lovers who are given an opportunity to get back together again. Maybe they’re married, and feelings have fizzled out, or they were together a long time ago and were forced apart for various reasons. They might start hanging out or hooking up as friends before they eventually realize they still have feelings for each other. Or, they may cross paths as “enemies” and be forced to be around each other until they eventually fall back in love. [7] X Research source Examples: The Notebook by Nicholas Sparks (Allie & Noah), Dawson’s Creek (Joey & Pacey), The Vow (Paige & Leo).

      "title": "One True Love",
      "content": "One True Love This romance trope is perhaps the most classic of all since it sees a character finding their perfect match, soulmate, or whatever predestined term you prefer. The characters in this story are the ideal match for each other, and their connection may even feel magical or instantaneous (i.e., love at first sight). This trope is often used with first loves or with long-distance relationships where these soulmates must overcome the separation with the power of their love. [8] X Research source Examples: One Day by David Nicholls (Emma & Dexter), The Vampire Diaries (Elena & Damon), Snow White and the Seven Dwarves (Snow White & the Prince).

    {
      "title": "Age Gap",
      "content": "Age Gap Also known as a May-December romance, an age gap romance features two characters that engage in a romantic relationship while having a significant age difference. Usually, the difference in age is at least 10-15 years or more, which causes them to confront generational differences, societal disapproval, and incompatibility in life stages throughout their story. [9] X Research source Examples: Part of Your World by Abby Jimenez (Alexis & Daniel), Younger (Liza & Josh), Harold and Maude (Harold & Maude)."

    {
      "title": "Fake Dating",
      "content": "Fake Dating In a ‘fake dating’ or ‘fake relationship’ trope, two characters make an agreement to pretend to be in a relationship or in love for whatever reason. As they continue to act out romantic scenarios with each other and convince their friends and family of their love, they eventually realize that their feelings for each other are more real than they thought. [10] X Research source Examples: The Love Hypothesis by Ali Hazelwood (Olive & Adam), To All the Boys I’ve Loved Before (Peter & Lara Jean), The Proposal (Andrew & Margaret)."
    },
    {
      "title": "Amnesia",
      "content": "Amnesia This straightforward trope features one character in the romance getting amnesia. Usually, the characters were already in love before one of them got amnesia, and then the story details their journey towards falling back in love. Alternatively, the pair may not know each other yet, but the amnesia plays a part in one of them keeping a secret or not knowing their true identity. [11] X Research source Examples: Someone to Watch Over Me by Lisa Kleypas (Grant & Vivien), 50 First Dates (Lucy & Henry), Falling for Christmas (Sierra & Jake)."
    },
    {
      "title": "Mistaken Identity",
      "content": "Mistaken Identity In a ‘mistaken identity’ story, one person mistakenly believes that their romantic interest is something or someone else. As opposed to the ‘secret identity’ trope, the identity of this person isn’t being deliberately withheld—or at least not at first. In this case, the mistaking of this person for another (and the ensuing drama) was not done intentionally. [12] X Research source Examples: Dream Girl Drama by Tessa Bailey (Sig & Chloe), The Princess Bride (Buttercup & Westley), You’ve Got Mail (Kathleen & Joe)."

    {
      "title": "Holiday Romance",
      "content": "Holiday Romance A favorite trope of the Hallmark channel, holiday romances celebrate the season by bringing together people (and future lovers) at holiday events and gatherings. These stories usually revolve around holidays like Christmas, Hanukkah, or New Year's, although other holidays may come into play from time to time. Examples: In a Holidaze by Christina Lauren (Maelyn & Andrew), The Holiday (Amanda & Graham, Iris & Miles), Home for Christmas (Johanne & Jonas)."

      "title": "Opposites Attract",
      "content": "Opposites Attract In an ‘opposites attract’ romance, the two main characters in a romantic partnership are total opposites in at least one significant way. They may have different personalities, backgrounds, or lifestyles, but they’re still somehow drawn to one another. They could be extroverted and introverted, spontaneous and cautious, rich and poor…but their story showcases how people are sometimes attracted to someone completely unexpected. [13] X Research source Examples: The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald (Gatsby & Daisy), Parks & Recreation (April & Andy), Grease (Sandy & Danny). Related Sub-Tropes: Spontaneous vs. serious Messy vs. neat Rich vs. poor Physical differences (i.e., height/overall size) Love interest has a profession that the protagonist hates Wanting different things (e.g., true love vs. a fling, country vs. city)"

    {
      "title": "Blind to Love",
      "content": "Blind to Love There are many types of ‘blind to love’ stories, but almost all portray one character who’s unaware of their clear love for another person, or two characters who are mutually unaware of their love for each other. This trope is often also referred to as “last to know” or “oblivious to love,” and it’s often combined with other tropes like “friends to lovers,” “enemies to lovers,” and “sworn off relationships.” Examples: Best of Me by L. K. Farlow (Duke & Valerie), Futurama (Fry & Leela), My Best Friend’s Wedding (Michael & Jules). Related Sub-Tropes: Aloof couple “Everyone can see it but them” Changing sexual preferences Dating the wrong person Can’t spit it out All grown up Slow burn"

      "title": "Sworn Off Relationships",
      "content": "Sworn Off Relationships With this trope, one of the romantic leads has decided to swear off love for whatever reason. Maybe it doesn’t fit their lifestyle, they’ve had too many negative experiences, maybe they don’t believe they’re worthy of love, or maybe they’re afraid of commitment. Who knows! Whatever the reason, it’s safe to say that they’ll change their mind about love by the end of the story. Examples: Sleigh Belle by ND Testa (Belle & Jake), Valentine’s Day (Kara & Kelvin), How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days (Ben & Andie). Related Sub-Tropes: “I’m not good enough for him/her” Afraid to commit"

    {
      "title": "Unrequited Love",
      "content": "Unrequited Love One of the most tragic of romance tropes is unrequited love (although this tragedy nearly always turns into a happy ending by the last page). Unrequited love refers to one person having strong romantic feelings for another person who doesn’t feel the same way about them. In a true romance novel, the second character will return the other’s feelings by the end. [14] X Research source Examples: The Wrong Bride by Catharina Maura (Raven & Ares), (500) Days of Summer (Tom & Summer), Pretty in Pink (Andie & Duckie)."

      "title": "Office Romance",
      "content": "Office Romance As a relatively true-to-life romance trope, the office romance typically takes place in a run-of-the-mill workplace. Two players might be forced together in their office for hours at a time while working on a project, or they might run into each other frequently during meetings, in hallways, and at work events. Eventually, after their sustained proximity to each other, they realize that they want to be more than just colleagues.

      "title": "Dark Past",
      "content": "Dark Past A ‘dark past’ as a romance trope refers to one or both romantic protagonists having some sort of dark past. Their traumatic or secretive past is shown to impact their present relationships, including the one with their new paramour. These tragic backstories are an excellent plot device, as they add complexity to the characters’ development and intensity to the narrative of the romance story. [17] X Research source Examples: The Sweetest Oblivion by Danielle Lori (Elena & Nicolas), Orange Is the New Black (Piper & Alex), Bones and All (Lee & Maren). Related Sub-Tropes: Dark secret Emotional scars Rejected by parents, friends, former lovers, etc. Redemption Break up to save them"

      "title": "Knight in Shining Armor",
      "content": "Knight in Shining Armor Likely one of the oldest (and, arguably, archaic) tropes on this list, the ‘knight in shining armor’ story portrays a heroic character who rescues a damsel in distress. The hero is traditionally masculine and a paragon of qualities like bravery, chivalry, and honor. The helpless damsel then falls in love with her chivalrous protector. In more modern takes, however, this trope is often subverted with a gender role reversal—commonly referred to as “dude in distress.” [18] X Research source Examples: Devil in Winter by Lisa Kleypas (Evangeline & Sebastian), Once Upon a Time (Charming & Snow), Gone With the Wind (Clark & Vivien). Related Sub-Tropes: Damsel/Dude in distress Kidnapped Protector Injury Road trip Wound tending"

      "title": "Different Worlds",
      "content": "Different Worlds In this trope, two characters develop a romantic interest in each other despite the fact that they’re from different “worlds” or backgrounds. They may travel in different social circles or have been raised in different financial classes. In a more literal sense, a sci-fi romance story might feature lovers who are literally from different planets! This difference in upbringing and culture is likely the main conflict in this couple’s love story. [19] X Research source Examples: The City of Brass by S.A. Chakraborty (Nahri & Ali), Enchanted (Giselle & Robert), Notting Hill (William & Anna). Related Sub-Tropes: Fish Out of Water"

      "title": "Sunny vs. Grumpy",
      "content": "Sunny vs. Grumpy This trope is similar to ‘opposites attract,’ but it’s such a popular dynamic that we had to give it its own category! In the sunny vs. grumpy trope, one character is constantly grumpy while the other is bubbly around the clock. Despite this distinct difference in their personalities, the pair turns out to be attracted to each other and balance each other out perfectly! Examples: Beach Read by Emily Henry (January & Augustus), Red, White & Royal Blue by Casey McQuiston (Alex & Prince Henry), New Girl (Nick & Jess). Related Sub-Tropes: Golden retriever and black cat relationship “Who hurt you?”"

      "title": "Love Triangle",
      "content": "Love Triangle The love triangle trope features three people, two of which have a romantic interest in the same person within the triangle. In most cases, the third person is interested in the other two people and is trying to decide between them, but other times the third person is not at all interested. Alternatively, each person may be crushing on another person in the triangle (i.e., Person 1 likes Person 2 who likes Person 3 who likes Person 1). [20] X Research source Examples: The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins (Katniss, Peeta, & Gale), Bridget Jones’s Diary (Bridget, Mark, & Daniel), Gilmore Girls (Rory, Jess, & Dean).

      "content": "Teacher/Parent Romance A teacher/parent romance is a modern trope that sees a teacher seducing or falling for the parent of one of their students. In real life (and in the romance books), these relationships are often discouraged, if not outright banned. As a result, these romantic stories often include other tropes like ‘secrets’ or ‘forbidden love.’ Examples: Can’t Text This by Teagan Hunter (Monty & Robbie), Hot for Teacher by Monique Fisher (Latrice & Nathan), The Princess Diaries (Helen & Mr. O’Connell). Related Sub-Tropes: Parent with new love"

      "content": "Marriage Before Romance In a ‘marriage before romance’ trope, the couple has married or become engaged before they actually fall in love with each other. This trope is most common in fantasy or historical romance stories, where an arranged marriage or marriage of convenience would be more common (although these tales can also be told in the modern day). The pair may also have gotten married drunkenly, and go on to fall in love after their tipsy nuptials. [21] X Research source Examples: Marriage for One by Ella Maise (Rose & Jack), Green Card (Bronte & Georges), Reign (Mary & Francis).

      "title": "Beauty and the Beast",
      "content": "Beauty and the Beast Borrowing its name from the beloved French fairytale, this trope refers to a romantic story where one outwardly “beautiful” or good-hearted person falls in love with a “beastly” character who’s considered frightening, rude, or monstrous by others. Throughout the course of the story, it becomes clear that the “beast” has a hidden depth, and this character is slowly transformed to reveal a good-hearted person who’s deserving of “beauty’s” affections. [22] X Research source Examples: Lord of Scoundrels by Loretta Chase (Jessica & Sebastian), Gossip Girl (Blair & Chuck), Down with Love (Barbara & Catcher).

      "content": "Suspect and Investigator In this Law and Order -esque trope, one character is investigating another for whatever reason. Maybe they’re actual officers of the law, or maybe they’re “investigating them” for cheating on an exam or another less serious offense. Despite the antagonistic nature of this pairing’s start, their forced proximity eventually leads to love. Examples: The Risk by S. T. Abby (Logan & Lana), Psych (Lassie & Marlow), Basic Instinct (Curran & Catherine). Related Sub-Tropes: Undercover love"

      "title": "Incorporate tropes that further your characters’ relationship and journey.",
      "content": "Incorporate tropes that further your characters’ relationship and journey. Tropes are a clever plot device that help to bring interest, intrigue, conflict, and familiarity to your story. However, it’s considered best to come up with your characters' arcs and general storyline before you pick a trope. Consider what types of characters you want to write, what type of a relationship you want them to have, and what type of romantic journey you want them to embark on together. Then, choose a trope (or multiple tropes) that best serves that story and intertwine them in your plot, using these tips for romance writing : [23] X Research source Always include a happily ever after (or HEA) if you want your book to be considered as a romance novel. If you want to finish with a tragic or uncertain ending, then be comfortable with your book belonging to a different genre. [24] X Research source Include multiple tropes in your story. For example, an enemies-to-lovers trope can be used alongside a love triangle, forced proximity, office romance, and more! Consider subverting a trope to make it more subtle or interesting. For instance, try the “beauty and the beast” trope with a gender swap (the masculine character as “beauty” and the feminine character as “the beast”). Author and writing coach Lydia Stevens affirms this last piece of advice, stating that “every cliche, every trope has been done. So, what you need to do when you’re taking that on into your own writing, is you need to make it your own…you have to take those [tropes] and make a twist to somehow make it your own story.”"

      "title": "Romance tropes are plot devices, characters, or themes common to the genre.",
      "content": "Romance tropes are plot devices, characters, or themes common to the genre. Readers can recognize tropes, which gives them a sense of familiarity and certainty. Tropes often help to build out the story’s plot and create conflict between the characters. [25] X Research source Since romance novels often follow similar patterns and almost exclusively end in happy endings, then readers can look forward to reading a story that they know they’ll love based on the trope alone. [26] X Research source Some examples of romance tropes include enemies-to-lovers, forced proximity, fish out of water, and friends-to-lovers."

      "title": "Clichés are considered overdone, while tropes are familiar but beloved.",
      "content": "Clichés are considered overdone, while tropes are familiar but beloved. Tropes and clichés are both repeated patterns and events that appear in stories. Tropes, however, represent familiar themes and plot devices that are derived from pre-existing storytelling patterns that readers recognize and continue to be drawn to. Clichés, on the other hand, are expressions, phrases, or concepts that have been so overused that they no longer have a powerful impact or conjure interest. [27] X Research source Often, clichés are considered to be outdated or even derogatory. For instance, tying a male character’s downfall to a seductive femme fatale (more than a tad misogynistic) or giving a villain a hook nose (which promotes the perceived wrongness of non-Eurocentric beauty standards). Romance is also a genre in which tropes are to be expected. Avid readers of romance will often search out new books based on the tropes they resemble, such as fake dating, age gaps, and secret identities. Stevens recommends not to “avoid clichés entirely, but to somehow repurpose them. Everything across any genre has been done before. So, don’t avoid them, but make them your own.”"

    {
      "title": "Some tropes are outdated or used without sufficient plot development.",
      "content": "Some tropes are outdated or used without sufficient plot development. Just like with any facet of writing a story or novel, writing a trope can definitely go wrong and end up detracting from the overall plot. Many common tropes are now considered to be controversial or problematic from a modern lens. For example, the Knight in Shining Armor trope, as traditionally used, can be misogynistic as it typically portrays female characters as one-dimensional and helpless. [28] X Research source An Ugly Duckling transformation trope is similarly controversial, as many believe that a woman (or a person of any gender) shouldn’t need an extravagant makeover and to completely change who they are in order to win over their so-called soulmate. [29] X Research source Another trope commonly mentioned in the “problematic” category is the “bully turns nice guy trope,” which often manifests as a cruel or toxic man making a singular grand gesture that wins back a girl. Other tropes are considered not problematic, but boring and overdone—verging on cliché territory. Love triangles are quite common and unrealistic, as are “miscommunication” conflicts where the whole plot could be resolved by a single conversation. From a technical standpoint, tropes can also fail to serve a plot when they’re used as a crutch for the writer. For example, if you write a “friends-to-lovers” story without giving enough time and detail to the “friends” part of their story, then readers won’t be as invested in the relationship."
