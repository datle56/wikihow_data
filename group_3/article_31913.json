      "content": "You’re a natural introvert. Introverts tend to dislike any setting with large groups of people, which naturally leads to feeling like an outsider in these situations. What’s more, introverts have limited social energy, which makes interpersonal connection hard—but not impossible. [1] X Research source If you’re an introvert, your craving for more limited social interaction might make you feel left out. But really, the key is finding those few, valuable connections. Quality over quantity. You have low self-esteem or anxiety. When you think less of yourself, you also tend to think that other people have what you don’t—smarts, looks, money, etc. In this way, low self-esteem creates an emotional gap between yourself and the people around you, causing you to feel like an imposter. [2] X Research source You’re in a new or negative environment. You might just be in the wrong place at the wrong time. Your school or work environment might not be suited to your learning needs or cater to your own patterns of thinking. The people around you might not be interested in the thing you’re interested in, which can be alienating. What’s more, people of color in majority-white environments, women, and people with disabilities often tend to feel like outsiders, since their surroundings too often aren’t designed to cater to them.

Go to source Negative past experiences make you feel isolated. You might have recently gone through the death of a loved one, a breakup, or a traumatic experience that you’re still working through. As you do, you may feel lonely or think that others don’t understand your pain, making you feel out-of-place or alienated. [4] X Trustworthy Source Mind U.K.-based mental health charity focused on providing advice and resources to anyone facing mental health problems. Go to source You’re naturally sensitive and self-aware. A little self-awareness is good, but that self-awareness can cause problems when you start to worry too much about how others see you, too. This “external self-awareness” makes you view yourself from an outsider’s perspective, which only makes you feel alienated from yourself, as well as from others. [5] X Research source You're an awakened soul on a spiritual path. Soul-searching usually begins with feeling like an outsider. You can embrace these feelings and use them as positive reinforcements in your life. Your spiritual journey has led you to this place and you can use this as a catalyst to growth and development on a soul level."

      "content": "Understand that you’re not alone. Experts estimate that about a third of Americans feel like an impostor at some point, which affects their mental well-being. [6] X Research source Many, many more likely feel disconnected from their peers, especially in this day and age. Realizing that you’re not alone in these feelings can ease your own sense of being an outsider. Remember, we’re all constantly seeking connection. Identify the cause of your feelings. Feeling like an outsider often stems from loneliness, and there are 3 kinds of loneliness. Think about which one resonates most with you. Once you identify this, it may be easier to grapple with and understand your feelings: Existential loneliness refers to feeling alone on your life path or your place in the universe. Emotional loneliness is the feeling that others don’t understand your feelings. Social loneliness is when you feel you don’t belong to a certain group. [7] X Research source Work on accepting yourself as you are. Fostering self-acceptance helps to build both confidence and a sense of belonging. Write yourself a letter and describe yourself as though you were describing a good friend. Or, repeat affirmations to get more used to positive self-talk. For example, repeat the sentence, “I’m worthy of love and respect” as you go about your day. Cut toxic people out of your life. A negative environment with negative people doesn’t help your sense of belonging. Deal with toxic people by physically avoiding them, if necessary, or consulting someone with authority, like a boss, teacher, or family member. Set boundaries with toxic people to protect your own peace. [8] X Research source Engage in group activities to connect with others. Human resources entrepreneur and consultant Jeffrey Fermin says, “Seek out clubs, workshops, or events in your local area that pertain to your passions and interests. Whether it's a book club, a hiking group, or a volunteer organization, being in an environment that reflects your values increases your chances of meeting like-minded people.” Focus on the quality of friends, rather than quantity. It’s easy to feel like an outcast when you’re “keeping score” of how many people you connect with. For many of us, a few close friends are better than many less familiar friends. [9] X Research source Look at your existing relationships and work on strengthening them instead of worrying about getting close to everyone you know. Get out of your comfort zone . Clinical psychologist Michael Dickerson says, “ Getting out of your comfort zone and gradually taking more social risks, such as talking to people, initiating conversations, etc. can be great exposure work for building social confidence. “As we engage in more social exposure, what was once uncomfortable will now seem more comfortable due to increased confidence from knowing you’re capable of being social around people.” Contribute to your community to boost your sense of belonging. Marriage and family therapist Moshe Ratson says, “The more you engage in contributing, you provide value to others, that in turn helps you recover and enhances your self-esteem and confidence.” Consider volunteering at a food bank, animal shelter, or other non-profit to give back to those around you and feel more integrated in your community."
