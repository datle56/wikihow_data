[2] X Expert Source Matt Garcia Phlebotomist Expert Interview. 9 November 2020. You need to know about the specific blood tests your doctor is ordering. Some blood tests will require special preparation to get accurate results. Some tests require fasting. This means no food or drink, other than plain water, for at least 8 hours. Juice, tea, or coffee should not be consumed because the sugars and calories in these beverages may cause inaccurate test results. [3] X Expert Source Matt Garcia Phlebotomist Expert Interview. 9 November 2020. In some cases, the glucose (blood sugar) and serum lipid (cholesterol) tests require fasting, but may not be necessary in other cases. Your doctor may order these tests as random, meaning fasting isn't needed. [4] X Expert Source Matt Garcia Phlebotomist Expert Interview. 9 November 2020. The oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) first involves a baseline fasting sample draw. Then, you'll consume a flavored drink containing a certain amount of glucose, and undergo additional blood draws over a period of several hours. The purpose is to see how fast your body metabolizes glucose and is often part of a pre-diabetes investigation. Make sure you are able to stay in the lab for the whole duration. [5] X Expert Source Matt Garcia Phlebotomist Expert Interview. 9 November 2020. Certain hormone tests such as cortisol, aldosterone, and renin require you to refrain from exercising the day before, lie down for 30 minutes before the test, and refrain from eating or drinking for 1 hour before the test. [6] X Expert Source Matt Garcia Phlebotomist Expert Interview. 9 November 2020. Tests to be done at a specific day or time. For instance, testosterone may be ordered as being drawn in the morning before 10 a.m., and progesterone should be tested on a specific day of a woman's menstrual cycle. [7] X Expert Source Matt Garcia Phlebotomist Expert Interview. 9 November 2020. Tests for monitoring certain medications, such as tacrolimus, are ordered as either pre-dose (before the next dose) or post-dose (2 hours after you take the medication). Be prepared to tell the lab staff the date and time of your last dose and the frequency with which you take the medication.

Latex can be found in gloves, tourniquets, and bandages, and an exposure can be life-threatening in a person with an allergy or sensitivity. It is important to notify both your doctor and the phlebotomist so they can use latex-free equipment. [14] X Research source Let the staff know if you're taking blood thinners such as warfarin (Coumadin) or apixaban (Eliquis). Since these medications prolong the time it takes your blood to clot, you and/or your phlebotomist will need to hold very firm pressure on the gauze for at least 5 minutes after the procedure to stop the bleeding.

If you have a history of feeling weak, sick, or faint during or after blood tests, you should definitely disclose this information to the lab staff. Phlebotomy chairs are designed with a sturdy armrest that swings over the lap to prevent fainting patients from falling to the floor.
