      "content": "Use the TTC trip planner. The Toronto Transit Commission (TTC) offers a helpful trip planner on its website. Simply enter your starting point and destination into the appropriate fields, then set your departure or arrival time. The planner will let you know which train to take and when to catch one that fits your schedule. You can find the trip planner here: https://www.ttc.ca/routes-and-schedules ."

      "content": "Download an interactive map. If you have a subway map on hand, you’ll have an idea of the system’s layout and will be less likely to miss a stop. If you don’t have a mobile device, you can ask the operator at any station’s staffed collector booth for a hard copy. The digital map will also let you know if a station offers parking, whether it’s handicap accessible, and other details. You can find a link to the interactive map, plus information about the TTC’s four lines and each individual station on the TTC subway page."

      "content": "Download the TTC transit app for scheduling information. The TTC app is available on the App Store and Google Play. In addition to a map and trip planning functions, it offers real-time arrival and departure updates. Trains typically arrive every two minutes during peak hours and every five minutes at other times. While you probably won’t have to wait long for a train, you can use the app to see when the next train will arrive and if there are any issues affecting your route."

      "title": "Check social media for service updates.",
      "content": "Check social media for service updates. Checking social media could spare you the headache of arriving at a station just to find out there’s a delay affecting your route. Peruse the TTC Twitter account ( https://twitter.com/TTCnotices ) or Facebook page ( https://www.facebook.com/TorontoTransitCommission ) just to stay on the safe side."

    {
      "title": "Check if your station has a parking lot.",
      "content": "Check if your station has a parking lot. You might plan on driving to a station, parking your car, and taking the subway into the city. Check the TTC website for a station on your route with a parking lot. Stations that have lots generally charge between $4 and $7 (CAD) for parking on weekdays. Parking is free on weekends and holidays. You can pay by coin, credit or debit card, or download a mobile pay app from the App Store or Google Play."

      "title": "Stop at a station’s staffed collector booth to purchase any fare form.",
      "content": "Stop at a station’s staffed collector booth to purchase any fare form. Every station has a staffed collector booth where you can purchase a one-way ticket, tokens, or passes. You can use both cash and credit or debit at collector booths, but automated kiosks are often either cash or credit only. There’s a $10 minimum for credit and debit transactions at collector booths. You can also ask the operator for a map or directions."

      "title": "Buy tokens in multiples to save some money.",
      "content": "Buy tokens in multiples to save some money. A single one-way ticket is $3.25, but if you buy tokens, you’ll pay $3 for a one-way trip. You have to buy at least three tokens at a time, but it’s worth saving some change if you’re taking more than one trip. You can buy tokens at collector booths or at token vending machines, which are available at most stations. Token vending machines are cash only."

      "title": "Purchase passes from vending machines at select stations.",
      "content": "Purchase passes from vending machines at select stations. At $43.75, an adult weekly pass could be cheaper than one-way tickets or tokens if you plan on taking at least two trips a day. The same goes for monthly passes, which cost $146.25. You can buy passes at collector booths and at automated vending machines, which are available at select stations. If there’s a long line at a collector booth, it might be quicker to get a pass from an automated vending machine. Keep in mind they’re credit or debit only."

      "content": "Purchase a PRESTO card if you’re a frequent rider. In 2017, the TTC launched the PRESTO card, which is a reloadable card with a mobile pay system. It costs $6, so it’s a better investment for frequent riders than for visitors or residents who rarely use public transit. Visit the PRESTO website to order a card, register your account, and reload a card: https://www.prestocard.ca/en/ ."

If you need an ID, visit the Sherbourne Station Photo ID Centre to have your picture taken. Your ID will be mailed to you when it’s finished, and you’ll then be eligible for discounted fares."

      "content": "Pay your fare and walk through the turnstile. Insert your ticket or token, or tap your PRESTO card to pay your fare. Walk through the turnstile, and look for signs directing you to the line and direction you need. Once you’ve found your bearings, proceed to the platform and wait for your train. Many stations run on multiple lines, so pay attention to the signs. If you’re at Bloor-Yonge and need to take Line 1 Northbound, don’t get mixed up and take Line 2 Eastbound."

      "title": "Get a transfer after you pay your fare.",
      "content": "Get a transfer after you pay your fare. You might plan your trip and notice you have to transfer from the subway to a streetcar or bus. Look for a red machine after you pay your fare and go through the turnstile. It will dispense a free paper transfer, which you’ll show to the bus or streetcar driver. [1] X Research source If you’re going from a streetcar or bus to a subway, ask the driver for a paper transfer. In general, you can only use transfers where two routes intersect. However, there are cases where two routes don’t intersect but are close enough that you can still transfer for free. You can find a full list of these walking transfer locations on the TTC website."

      "content": "Board the train after other commuters have exited the train. While waiting on the platform, stand clear of the yellow line until your train arrives and comes to a complete stop. When it pulls in and the doors open, practice good etiquette and let passengers exit the train before you try to board. Watch your step, and mind the small gap between the platform and the train."

      "content": "Get off at your stop and head for the exit or transfer point. When you get off the train at your stop, follow signs toward the exit, to a bus or streetcar transfer, or to the next subway line you have to take. For instance, you might have to transfer from Line 1 Yonge-University Southbound to Line 2 Bloor-Danforth Eastbound at St. George Station. There are usually metal plaques in the ground near exits. They include compass directions and nearby street names to help you find your bearings. [2] X Research source"
