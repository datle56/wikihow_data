Select a commercial floor stripper appropriate for stone and dilute with water according to label. Mop this over the floor and let dry, then rinse if directed by the label. Floor strippers are powerful chemicals. Protect yourself with goggles, rubber gloves, and excellent ventilation."

An alkaline (high pH) cleaner such as ammonia-based glass cleaner or natural stone cleaner is your best bet for slate. If that doesn't work, rinse it off and try a mild acidic cleaner. Your best option is an alkaline commercial cleaner from a home improvement store, specifically for slate or at least for natural stone. Test all cleaners on a corner first. Acid can discolor some types of slate. [4] X Research source Alkaline cleaners are less likely to cause damage, but this is not guaranteed."

      "content": "Learn the pros and cons of sealer. Stone sealer can create as glossy a surface as you like, but can make it very slippery, especially when wet. If the slate is outdoors or in an unheated room, water can seep under the sealer and crack off the sealer when it freezes and thaws. Slate can be honed (smooth) or rough (with small jagged edges). Sealer is more effective on honed slate."

If you do decide to apply a sealer, find one specifically designed for slate or at least natural stone, preferably a penetrating sealer for long-lasting protection. Apply a thin layer with a paintbrush, following the grain of the slate. Let dry for two hours (or as the label recommends), and reapply as necessary. Test the sealer on a corner to ensure it results in the desired gloss/matte, slip resistance, and color."
