      "title": "Check the inside of the helmet for a clock-like symbol.",
      "content": "Check the inside of the helmet for a clock-like symbol. Look for a small circular symbol that’s similar to an analog clock face, with numbers 1 through 12 placed in order around the perimeter. Instead of an hour hand and minute hand, this “clock face” should have a single arrow pointing at one of the perimeter numbers. [1] X Research source The symbol isn't a sticker, but rather a raised stamp created from the helmet’s molded plastic material. This date of manufacture symbol is common in many molded plastic products."
    },
    {
      "title": "Determine where the arrow is pointing for the month of manufacture.",
      "content": "Determine where the arrow is pointing for the month of manufacture. The numbers going around the perimeter symbol represent the months of the year—January is 1, February is 2, and so on up to December as 12. The tip of the arrow in the symbol points to the number that corresponds to the month of manufacture. [2] X Research source For example, if the arrow is pointing at 5, the helmet was produced in May; if it’s pointing at 10, the helmet was made in October."
    },
    {
      "title": "Look for the year of manufacture in the clock face’s center.",
      "content": "Look for the year of manufacture in the clock face’s center. In the middle of the clock face symbol, on either side of the arrow, you’ll see a 2-digit number ranging from 00 to 99. These represent the last 2 digits of the year of manufacture. [3] X Research source For example, 18 represents 2018, meaning the helmet was manufactured in that year. So, if the arrow is pointing at 10 and there’s an 18 in the center, the helmet was produced in October 2018."
    },
    {
      "title": "Check for an alternate symbol if you don’t see the clock face.",
      "content": "Check for an alternate symbol if you don’t see the clock face. Depending on government regulations and/or manufacturer preferences, some safety helmets may use a different date of manufacture symbol. While the clock face symbol is by far the most common, you might instead, for example, see a square broken up into 4 smaller squares with a 2-digit number in its center. The number represents the year of manufacture, while the quadrant squares represent 3-month periods of the year. [4] X Research source The top left quadrant represents January to March; the top right, April to June; the bottom right, July to September; and the bottom left, October to December. Check each quadrant for a single raised dot in its center. If you see a dot in only the upper left quadrant, the helmet was made between January and March. If you see dots in both upper quadrants, the helmet was made between April and June, and so on."

      "title": "Get rid of your helmet immediately if it sustains an impact.",
      "content": "Get rid of your helmet immediately if it sustains an impact. When worn and maintained properly, safety helmets do a great job of protecting your head from a single impact. But they’re only made to work against that single impact. After that, and even if you can’t see any damage, the helmet should be discarded and replaced. [5] X Research source You might be asking what constitutes an “impact.” Put it this way—if you would have sustained a mild (or worse) head injury without the helmet, replace it."

    {
      "title": "Inspect the helmet daily and replace it if you find damage.",
      "content": "Inspect the helmet daily and replace it if you find damage. Safety helmets are tough and durable, but they’re not indestructible. Look closely at the start of each workday for any cracks, nicks, chips, dents, or other signs of damage. As soon as your spot any damage, no matter how minor, replace the helmet. [6] X Research source Check the adjustable headband and other interior components as well. These parts can sometimes be swapped out without replacing the entire helmet, but it’s important to use manufacturer-approved replacement parts that match the old ones exactly."

    {
      "title": "Check the maker’s maximum service life recommendation.",
      "content": "Check the maker’s maximum service life recommendation. Under ideal working conditions, the maximum service life for a safety helmet ranges from 2 to 5 years. In most cases, it’s up to the helmet manufacturer to set this max range for their product, so check the product guide or the manufacturer’s website to get the max life number for a particular helmet model. [7] X Research source In some cases, government regulations or company policies may set a shorter max service life number for your safety helmet. Always use the smallest number (the least number of years) from among the manufacturer, government, and/or business requirements."

    {
      "title": "Calculate service life from the date of issue or date of manufacture.",
      "content": "Calculate service life from the date of issue or date of manufacture. Technically speaking, the “service life” of a helmet begins on the date of issue—the date when you start actually using it. However, if you haven’t clearly recorded the date of issue—either in the helmet or in a safety file—use the date of manufacture as the starting point for the service life. [8] X Research source Some helmet manufacturers provide a sticker that you can affix to the inside of the helmet after writing your name and the date of issue on it. Use a durable permanent marker to write this info and refresh it as needed when the writing starts to fade."

    {
      "title": "Reduce the max service life for helmets used in harsh conditions.",
      "content": "Reduce the max service life for helmets used in harsh conditions. Always keep in mind that the service life number is a maximum, not a guarantee! A helmet may only last for an hour if it sustains an impact, and things like harsh weather conditions can definitely reduce the safe lifespan of your gear. Frequently wearing and/or storing your helmet in direct sunlight, for example, will cause it to show signs of wear and tear more quickly. [9] X Research source There’s no set formula, but it’s a safe bet to reduce the max service life by 1/3 to 1/2 (e.g., from 4 years to 2) if the helmet is regularly used in harsh weather conditions. Inspect your helmet daily no matter what, but take even greater care if you use or store it in sunny, rainy, windy, or snowy weather. Replace it immediately if you see any chips, cracks, or bubbling/blistering of the material."

      "title": "Care for your helmet properly to extend its service life.",
      "content": "Care for your helmet properly to extend its service life. Treat your helmet like a finely-tuned safety tool, not just another piece of equipment that you can toss aside at the end of your workday. With proper care, your helmet will last longer and, more importantly, be more likely to protect you when you need it most. Wipe away dirt and debris as often as once per day, using a gentle cleanser such as dish soap and water or a multi-purpose spray cleaner. Do not use harsh cleaning solvents or rough scrubbers (such as steel wool) on the helmet. Do not paint your helmet, since the solvents in the paint may weaken the helmet material. Using permanent markers is probably okay, but check with the manufacturer, your employer, and your government’s safety agency first. Apply stickers to your helmet only if permitted by the manufacturer, your employer, and your government safety agency. Pressure-adhesive stickers are very unlikely to affect the helmet material, but they can conceal damage to the helmet. Never put stickers near the edges of the helmet, since signs of wear and tear often appear there first."

      "title": "Wear your helmet correctly so it can protect you effectively.",
      "content": "Wear your helmet correctly so it can protect you effectively. Adjust the headband so that the helmet fits snugly but comfortably at the crown of your head—the front of the headband should rest about 1 in (2.5 cm) above your eyebrows. Keep the helmet level on your head, not tilted forward or back. Avoid wearing the helmet backwards. [10] X Research source Most importantly: wear your helmet at least when and where required, and—even better—whenever your head is in danger of injury!"
