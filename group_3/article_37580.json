Leave about 1 inch (2.5 cm) of the stalk, or spike, so that it can regrow.

      "content": "Move the orchid to a new pot once the roots start poking out of the bottom. Water the orchid, then gently tug the plant out of its pot. Use your hands to loosen the roots a bit and dust off any growing media stuck to them. Then, carefully place the orchid into the new pot. [2] X Research source If possible, pick a pot designed for orchids. If you can’t find one, opt for a pot with lots of drainage holes to allow air to flow in and water to drain out. Put a saucer underneath the pot to catch excess water. If the roots of your orchid begin growing out through the holes in the bottom of the pot, that’s an indication that the pot is too small and you should move it to a larger one."

      "content": "Add fresh growing medium to give your orchid a nutrient boost. To promote the reblooming of orchids, mix 2 parts bark formulated specifically for orchids with 1 part peat moss to create the growing medium. Fill the space around the roots with the medium and add a light layer on top, but be sure you don’t cover the leaves.

      "content": "Water less often if you notice mushy roots. Most orchid issues are caused by overwatering . Your orchid might be getting too much water if it has soggy roots or rotting, limp, or discolored leaves. Just decrease how much, and how frequently, you water your orchid to get it to look its best. [8] X Research source If the roots are rotted , trim off the worst of the damage and repot the plant to provide it with additional nutrients. Be sure to dump out any water that collects in the saucer underneath the pot after you water. Orchids prefer to be flushed out than to sit in a pool of standing water. To do this, simply take your plant to a sink and flush out the pot with water, rinsing the roots for a few seconds. Just try not to get any water in the crooks of the green leaves when you do this!

      "title": "Increase how much you’re watering if the roots are dry and shriveled.",
      "content": "Increase how much you’re watering if the roots are dry and shriveled. Alternatively, some orchids don’t get enough water and fail to thrive as a result. If the roots look dry and shriveled instead of lush and plump, your plant is dehydrated. Another sign of underwatering is shriveled or discolored leaves. Water your orchid more frequently to correct this problem. [10] X Research source Use room-temperature water to water your orchid. Rainwater is ideal, but tap water that has sat out for 24 hours will also work, as this gives the chlorine time to evaporate."

      "content": "Provide more light if the leaves are dark green. Orchids thrive in sunny environments. If yours has very dark green leaves, it might not be getting enough sunlight. Try moving it in front of a window or into a sunnier outdoor spot.

      "content": "Reduce the amount of light your orchid gets if it’s sunburned. Orchids that receive too much light may first show yellow leaves. As time goes on, the leaves will turn white, then brown. Additionally, if the leaves feel hot to the touch, it’s getting too much sun. If you notice these symptoms, move your orchid to an area with less direct sunlight. [13] X Research source You can move the plant further away from a window or provide more shade by situating it near taller plants or trees."

Signs of heat stress include yellowing, withered, or leathery leaves or brown roots or leaf tips. [15] X Research source"
