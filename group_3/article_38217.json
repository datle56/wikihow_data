      "title": "“I want to kiss you.”",
      "content": "“I want to kiss you.” Pronounce it “kee-arrow bay-sar-tay.” While it is technically an exact translation, “Quiero besarte” may not be so common as other, more lyrical phrases. If you are traveling, consider the way that people commonly ask for kisses in this culture, and try asking someone from your specific location for advice. [1] X Research source ”Quiero” is the “I” conjugation of the verb “querer,” “to want.” ”Besarte” is the you-directed unconjugated form of the verb “besar,” or “to kiss.” “Te” refers to “you.” Thus, “besarte” literally means “to kiss you.”"

      "title": "“Can I kiss you?”",
      "content": "“Can I kiss you?” Pronounce it “pway-doh bay-sar-tay?” [2] X Research source Think about the implication of asking to kiss someone versus saying that you want to kiss someone. Asking gives your date an explicit choice in the matter, and it also puts him/her on the spot to say “si” or “no.” This option might be best if you are less confident that the person wants to kiss you back."

      "title": "“Kiss me.”",
      "content": "“Kiss me.” Pronounce it “bay-sa-may.” [3] X Research source It is a phrase that's much-used in songs and relationships throughout the Spanish-speaking world. [4] X Research source It is also a more outwardly confident way of saying that you want to kiss someone. It's not a question, it's an imperative: “Kiss me!” Consider how well you know the person, and whether this is appropriate."

    {
      "title": "“I would like to seal your lips with mine.”",
      "content": "“I would like to seal your lips with mine.” Pronounce it, “May goo-star-ee-a say-yar toos la-bee-os cohn los mee-os.” If you are trying to kiss a non-native Spanish speaker, then he or she may not pick up the nuance of this phrase. However, a native Spanish speaker may find these words more lyrical and romantic than a plain “Besame” or “Quiero besarte.” ”Me gustaría” is the conditional conjugation of “gustar,” meaning “to like” or “to please.” Think of the phrase like, “It would please me to kiss you.” ”Sellar” is the verb “to stamp.” [5] X Research source ”Labios” are lips. “Con los míos,” means “with mine.” or, in context, “with my lips.”"
