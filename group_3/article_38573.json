      "content": "Notice that you feel like Wonder Woman around him. He should make you feel like a superhero. You should feel like you can be anybody and do anything when you're with him. You should be unafraid of the challenges in your life because he makes you confident that you are strong enough to get through them. When you're with him, you should feel like you can take on the world and win."

      "content": "Make sure you feel comfortable being yourself in front of him. This doesn't just mean being that \"silly you\" that only your close friends or family know; it means letting him see you vulnerable, whether it's without make-up, after a sweaty workout, when you're afraid, or while you cry.

      "content": "Make sure you don't feel ashamed around him. Do you feel the need to hide things around him? If you feel that you need to hide things about yourself or your life, then maybe he's not the one. He should love you no matter what, and if you worry that he'd leave you over your slightly-hairy wintertime legs, then maybe he isn't the one. Of course, that doesn't mean there won't be any conflict between the two of you! Differences in opinions and ideas will always come up, no matter how much you love each other. The key isn't unconditional agreement so much as it is a commitment to navigate conflict in healthy, respectful ways. See if it is possible to be direct, open, and honest with each other. [2] X Research source Consider whether your partner hears your feedback and does reflective listening. [3] X Research source Think about whether you can have a conversation with them to improve your relationship. For example, if your partner is secretive, can you tell them you feel insecure and ask them to be more open. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Notice when he says \"I love you\".",
      "content": "Notice when he says \"I love you\". It's nice if he says \"I love you too\" after you say it but it's important that you aren't the only person saying the initial I love you. He needs to say it sometimes too. This shows that he thinks about how much he cares about you and that he's not just following the standard script that he feels is expected. Don't get too worried if he doesn't, though. Some guys are very shy about sharing their feelings. Ask him why he never says it first and tell him that you like to hear it. This might make him more comfortable saying it to you."

      "title": "Make sure he doesn't pressure you to become intimate before you are ready.",
      "content": "Make sure he doesn't pressure you to become intimate before you are ready. Someone who wants to enjoy your body before your heart is willing clearly doesn't have your needs in mind. The same is true in reverse: if you aren't willing to wait for him to be ready, you may need to reevaluate the level of commitment you have toward him. If one or both of you can't see past your own desires when it comes to sex, you may also find it difficult to put the needs of the other ahead of your own desires when it comes to committing or starting a family. Keep the idea of balance in mind. Neither one of you should neglect the needs of the other, which means that, along with caring for his needs, you also need to make sure he cares for your needs!"

      "content": "Notice whether or not he alludes to your future. If the two of you aren't in the stages of a relationship where you openly discuss future possibilities, pay attention to whether or not he drops any hints. Even something small, like wondering what the two of you will do for an event that's at least a month or two away, is a good sign. If he proposes to you too soon (e.g., before 1 year), take some time to analyze why he is rushing. If you are inclined to say yes, suggest a long engagement to be sure. If he absolutely won't discuss a future together – even after a significant amount of time (say a year) – he is probably not considering one."

On the other hand, if you don't feel secure about a relationship, you may subconsciously find excuses not to introduce or discuss him. Do you include him in family plans, such as inviting him on your family vacation (or even simply assuming that he will accompany your family without needing an invitation)? Do you want to help him get along with his family (or even stick up for him) because it's important that they like you? Do you suggest that he should call your mother if he needs advice on cooking, cleaning, etc.?"

Sometimes we change each other for the better and sometimes we change each other for the worse. You will need to decide if you positively impact him and he positively impacts you. [6] X Research source Do you find that either of you is becoming possessive, jealous, distrusting, lazy, or constantly stressed out? This is probably not someone you want to be around. They probably are not the one for you and you will not like the person you become if you stay with them. Do you find that you inspire each other to be better people? Do you strive for more from life and for yourself when you're with him? Does he do the same? Do you make each other kinder, happier people?

Do you openly tell him you love him, even offering qualifiers such as \"I love you a lot\" or initiating the \"I love you more\" game? Look for discrepancies between what is said and what is communicated . We're often so blindsided by someone who waxes poetic about their love that we fail to notice whether or not they've done anything to back it up. At the same time, we might be so frustrated by someone who doesn't spout poetry that we overlook all the thoughtful, loving gestures they've made. Reflect on whether either of you fits into one of these categories."

It's often said that living together is the true test of compatibility; a relationship that takes place entirely in restaurants and parks might be wine and roses, but having to share dishes, watch each other shave, and trip over dirty laundry can dispel an illusion in no time. If you live together, how well do you compromise on individual and shared responsibilities? If you don't, have you at least swapped keys to each other's places? And if so, how welcome do you both feel? [7] X Research source"
