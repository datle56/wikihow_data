      "title": "Use freezing cold alcohol to reduce the sting of a shot.",
      "content": "Use freezing cold alcohol to reduce the sting of a shot. Stick your bottle of alcohol in your freezer 2-3 hours before you you start drinking. Wait until it’s nice and cold so the shots go down smoother. [1] X Research source Alcohol can’t freeze, so you can keep it in your freezer for as long as you want! The coldness of the alcohol can help it feel like it’s burning less, while room temperature shots may feel much harsher in your mouth."

      "title": "Choose a fruit juice chaser for shots of vodka.",
      "content": "Choose a fruit juice chaser for shots of vodka. Juice is a common and tasty chaser you can use for a variety of alcohols, but it can be really helpful for cutting down the taste of clear liquor like vodka. Have a glass of fruit juice handy for when you take your shot so you can reduce the burn and get rid of the taste. Try using cranberry juice or orange juice as tasty chasers that are actually even a little healthy. Many bars will have juices like pineapple and grapefruit that you can use as a chaser. Some strong juices, like grape juice, may not taste well as a chaser for alcohol, so go with a lighter option instead."

      "content": "Suck on a lime wedge to chase a shot of tequila. The citrus juice in lime can relieve the burn from a shot of tequila. Cut up some limes and have them ready to go. Once you take your shot, stick a wedge in your mouth and suck on the juices. [2] X Research source You can also use salt to help cut down the burn of tequila. Pour some salt in a dish, rub your lime around the rim of your shot glass to get some juice on it, then dip the rim into the salt so it sticks to it. Before you take your shot, lick the salt off of your glass."

      "title": "Grab a soft drink to sip after a shot of whiskey or rum.",
      "content": "Grab a soft drink to sip after a shot of whiskey or rum. Sodas are easy to find and great to use as a chaser for many liquors, especially whiskey or rum. Crack open a can of soda to use as a chaser for your shots. A caffeine-free soda can help minimize the symptoms of a hangover because caffeine can dehydrate you and make your symptoms worse. [3] X Research source Sprite and ginger ale work with nearly any type of alcohol. You can also always just choose a soft drink that you enjoy to use as a chaser."

      "content": "Try pickle juice as another option chaser for whiskey. It might sound crazy, but taking a sip or a shot of pickle juice as a chaser for your whiskey, also known as a pickle back, can actually reduce the burn. [4] X Research source If you’re feeling adventurous, have a small shot glass or cup of pickle juice nearby and give it a . . . shot! Take it up a notch by using spicy pickle juice."

      "content": "Go with club soda as a low-calorie chaser option. Club soda can help cut the taste of a shot and won’t add any sweetness like soda and juice.

[5] X Research source Using a club soda also means less sugar, which means you may have less of a hangover."

      "content": "Take a sip of your chaser before you take a shot. Avoid having just the overwhelming taste of alcohol in your mouth by taking a small sip of your chaser before you take your shot. Then, take your shot and follow it up with another sip of your chaser to get rid of the burn and wash away the taste. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Savor a fine whiskey by taking small sips. Rather than shooting back a shot of a fine scotch, bourbon, or another type of whiskey, take a small sip. Hold it on your tongue and let it spread around your mouth to get a sense of its mouthfeel and flavors before you swallow it. [7] X Research source Since a sip is much smaller than a shot, the alcohol won’t burn as much."

      "content": "Add a splash of water to cut strong whiskey. Adding a small amount of water to your whiskey not only dilutes and reduces its burn, it actually helps bring out some of the subtle notes and enhance the flavor profile. Pour your glass of whiskey and add a few drops of water into it to make it both taste better and burn less. [8] X Research source You could also use club soda to add some fizz to your whiskey as well. If you want to add some extra flavor, add a splash of ginger ale to your whiskey. [9] X Research source"

      "content": "Use mineral water to cut clear spirits. Clear spirits like vodka and gin are better served with mineral water.

[11] X Research source Tonic water also works as a great cutting agent for gin."

Combine the alcohol with tasty mixers to create a mixed drink that you can enjoy. [12] X Research source Mix together equal parts peach schnapps and OJ for a classic fuzzy navel. Or keep it simple with a screwdriver: add a shot or 2 of vodka to a glass and fill it up with OJ.
