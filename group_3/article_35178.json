      "title": "Choose a hand.",
      "content": "Choose a hand. In palmistry , it is thought that: For women, the right hand is what you're born with, and left is what you've accumulated throughout your life. For men, it is the other way around. The left hand is what you're born with, and the right is what you've accumulated throughout your life. That being said, you can also choose whichever hand is dominant to be your present/past life hand (the non-dominant hand would then be your future life hand). There are different schools of thought on the matter. Some say the left-hand show's potential and what could be -- not necessarily what will be. And a difference in the hands could mean one is or is about to take action when it comes to their lives, changing it. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Look at the mounts . That's what the fleshy bit below your fingers are called, on the opposite side of your knuckle. To make them visible, cup your hand just a bit. Which one is the largest? A high Venus mount (the one under your thumb) indicates a predisposition for hedonism, promiscuity, and the need for instant gratification. A non-existent Venus mount indicates little interest in family matters. The mount under your index finger is called the Jupiter mount. If this is well-developed, it means you are dominant, possibly self-centered , and aggressive. A lack of one means you lack confidence. Under your middle finger is the Saturn mount. A high mount shows you're stubborn, cynical, and prone to depression . If it is low, it's an indicator of superficiality and disorganization. The Sun mount is under your ring finger. You're quick-tempered, extravagant, and prideful if you have a high Sun mount. A low Sun mount means you lack imagination . The Mercury mount is under your pinkie. If it's protruding, you talk too much. A low mount means the opposite -- you're shy. None of this is based on science, and hands are known to change throughout time, so don't take this information too seriously."

      "content": "Examine the hand and finger size. Relative to the size of the body, some say that small hands are active and don't dwell on thinking about what to do. Large hands are on those who are contemplative and slow to action. [2] X Research source Remember, this is relative to the body . If you're 8 feet (2.4 m) tall (2.4 m), you're going to have bigger hands than a 4-year-old. It's all proportional. What're more, long fingers may be an indicator of anxiety, in addition to being well-mannered, good-looking, and delicate. Short fingers are found on impatient, highly sexed, and creative. Long fingernails, on the other hand, mean you're kind and a good secret keeper. Short fingernails mean you're critical and sarcastic. If they're almond-shaped, you're sweet and diplomatic.
