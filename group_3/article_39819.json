      "content": "Type TCL or ToggleCollision and hit ↵ Enter . TCL is shorthand for ToggleCollision . This command will enable noclip mode, which means you can move your character around the game and clip through walls, or even the ground. You can also fly in noclip mode. \"Collision\" refers to a model not being able to clip/intersect with another model (it's what keeps your character model from clipping through the ground model and falling due to the physics engine of the game, for example)."

      "content": "Repeat the steps to turn noclip off. Simply enter the console again by pressing ~ / ` , typing TCL or ToggleCollision , and pressing Enter . You'll now be playing the game normally. Note that if you're underground or flying when you turn noclip off, you may have unintended results (such as falling to the ground and dying, or falling through the map)."
