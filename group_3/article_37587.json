      "content": "Ask your vet for a spot-on medication. “Spot-on” treatments are applied directly to your pet's skin to kill fleas quickly. Many of these monthly treatments should be used year round as a preventative treatment. Be aware that just because a product is a 'spot-on' doesn't mean it is effective. It is essential to use a flea product with is licensed to kill fleas, which means that it is proven to be beneficial. If in doubt speak to your veterinarian. Make sure that the product you choose is labeled for your pet. Cats can get very sick (or even die) if they are treated with a flea medication that is meant for dogs. Frontline will kill rabbits. [2] X Research source Some common flea medications include: Permethrine: Many products for dogs contain permethrine alone or in combination with other drugs, to effectively treat fleas in dogs. [3] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source It is not safe for use with all pets, and it can cause health problems in both humans and dogs. Dinotefuran and pyriproxyfen (known as Vectra) is used to treat fleas in cats. Be careful: Vectra 3D is a product for dogs. Vectra 3D contains permethrin, which is harmful to cats. [4] X Research source Fipronil and (S)-methoprene (known as Frontline Plus for Cats): This product kills flea larvae, eggs, and adult fleas. It also kills ticks and chewing lice. [5] X Research source Imidacloprid and pyriproxyfen (known as Advantage II): This product kills fleas of all life stages. Be sure not to get a similarly named product, Advantix II, which is a product for dogs. It contains permethrin, which is harmful to cats. [6] X Research source Selamectin (known as Revolution): Apply this once a month. It also kills ticks, heartworms, ear mites, and sarcoptic mites. [7] X Research source Be careful about what chemicals you are using. Products like Advantage manufactured by Bayer contain neonicotinoids which have been shown to have serious ecological impacts including contributing to the wide spread loss of bees around the world.

      "content": "Consider getting an oral flea medication from your veterinarian. Oral products usually act quickly and don't leave any residue. They're only available through your vet, who can recommend the best product. Many of these monthly treatments should be used year round as a preventative treatment. These medications may include: [9] X Trustworthy Source University of Kentucky College of Agriculture, Food, and Environment Program in the University of Kentucky devoted to scientific research and public education Go to source Lufenuron (known as Program): This comes as tablets, an oral suspension liquid, or injections and is an option for cats only. Give this medication with food once a month. Be aware that Program does not kill fleas but sterilizes them, making them incapable of breeding. If you have a heavy flea infestation then this is not the best product for you, as you will have to wait for the fleas to die of old age. It's best use is in a clean household when you don't want the odd visiting flea to establish a family. [10] X Research source Nitenpyram (known as Capstar): This comes as a pill. Give it to your pet according to your veterinarian's directions to kill adult fleas. Keep in mind that nitenpyram only kills adult fleas. It is a neonicotinoid and constricts the central nervous system of fleas. Spinosad (known as Comfortis): This comes as chewable tablets, which you should give your pet with food once a month to kill fleas. [11] X Research source"

      "content": "See if your local groomer or vet will do a flea bath for your pet. Many veterinarians and groomers will provide this service. For smaller pets, it is recommended that you see a veterinarian and not a groomer. A groomer is unlikely to be equipped to help treat a bird with fleas. Be aware that after the bath, once the pet is dry, there is nothing to deter more fleas from jumping back on the pet."

      "title": "Use just water.",
      "content": "Use just water. For some pets, such as guinea pigs, it is not possible to use many of the flea treatments available. In this case, a simple bath may be your only option. By bathing the pet in warm, not hot, water, you're trying to drown the fleas. This won't likely kill any eggs left, and it may be necessary to comb your pet, as well as repeat this bath. Since the fleas will run to the head and face of your pet once you start wetting them, it is best to wet and lather up only the neck first then the rest of your pet. This will create a barrier to prevent the fleas from invading your pet's face and ears. Use room temperature or slightly warm water, so as not to shock or harm your pet. Stop the bath with small pets that get too stressed out. Animals like rabbits and guinea pigs can die from fear-induced heart-attacks. [12] X Research source"

It is important to talk to your vet before using these products, so as to be sure it is safe for your pet. These have largely been superseded now by other options for flea control. One disadvantage of powders is that they can be inhaled, which is not healthy for you or the animal. These powders can be useful when a bath is not possible."

Mixing diatomaceous earth with sand and providing it to birds can encourage them to dust themselves with it. You may also dust the bird yourself. Make sure to use a mask when handling DE.

Fleas like to hold on by the root. If you do not comb up the entire length of the hair, you are likely to miss some.

Look for an environmentally friendly borate-derivative powder to apply to your carpets that will prevent fleas from infesting. Clean their crate or bed. Treat any area they spend time in. For small animals, clean the cage or tank and any toys with hot, soapy water. Dispose of any bedding such as wood shavings or newspaper. This also includes treating any other animals in your home. Pets act as a reservoir for fleas, so the fleas will likely travel from one pet to another if they need to."

      "title": "Vacuum and/or steam clean.",
      "content": "Vacuum and/or steam clean. Because fleas can survive in your house, away from their host, for quite some time, it is important to vacuum frequently. Steam cleaning is also an excellent way to treat your home for fleas, as the steam will kill them. Make sure to do one or both of these things the entire length of treatment and after. Keeping everything cleaned and washed will help prevent fleas. If you do, the fleas won't have the time or space necessary to live and breed. Dispose of the vacuum bag afterward to prevent reinfestation. Vacuum cleaners can kill fleas as well as chemical treatments."

      "title": "Wash all linens.",
      "content": "Wash all linens. Fleas can hide in bedding, towels, and clothing. Make sure to wash everything in hot water, to kill fleas and their eggs. Wash drapery and pillows too, as these can also harbor fleas. Soak your pet's bed in hot, soapy water for at least 15 minutes; wash, rinse, and let dry, or dry with a towel. This breaks down the fleas' waxy coating, and they will dehydrate and die."

By keeping your pet off the furniture, you can help control the spread of fleas."

      "content": "Spray floors and bedding with an Insect Growth Regulator (IGR). IGRs, such as Nylar, stop the fleas from developing, thereby breaking the reproduction cycle. This is a blessing when attempting to bring large infestations under control. The most economical method is to buy a concentrate and mix according to the directions that come with the product. Typically, the application will need to be done twice, at a minimum—about three and a half weeks apart. Often it is advantageous to spray the areas of the house frequented by your pets on a monthly basis during flea season. IGRs are not poisonous to mammals. This makes IGRs a good option around a house that has kids or small animals such as hamsters."
