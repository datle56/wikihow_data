      "content": "Select your fish. While you can poach any kind of fish, you should choose a fish that benefits from the flavor of being poached in milk. Delicate white fish works well and so do fillets of: Bass Cod Haddock Halibut Salmon Sole, Tilapia"

      "title": "Heat milk and salt in a saucepan.",
      "content": "Heat milk and salt in a saucepan. Select a wide-bottomed saucepan and set it on the stove. Pour in 2 cups (500 ml) of whole milk and add a pinch of salt. Turn the heat on to low and bring the milk to a light simmer. [1] X Research source The milk should just bubble a little when it reaches a light simmer. You can also replace the milk with coconut milk, fish stock, or broth."

      "title": "Add the fish and poach it.",
      "content": "Add the fish and poach it. Place two fillets of skinless fish in the pan with simmering milk. Each piece should be about 1/3 of a pound (150g). The milk should come about halfway up the sides of the fish. Continue to simmer the milk after you've added the fish and let it cook for 5 to 8 minutes. [2] X Research source Try to select fillets of fish that are similar in size. This will ensure that they cook evenly. You don't need to turn or flip the fish as it poaches. This could cause it to fall apart or overcook."

    {
      "title": "Check to see if the fish is done.",
      "content": "Check to see if the fish is done. Take a bamboo or metal skewer and insert it into the thickest part of the poached fish. The skewer should slide right in and be easy to remove. If it's hard to poke the skewer into the fish, it needs to poach a little longer. If you take a fork and gently rub it over the fish, the fish should flake. [3] X Research source Let the fish cook for another minute and check it again. Fish cooks quickly so, check it frequently."

    {
      "title": "Remove and serve the poached fish.",
      "content": "Remove and serve the poached fish. Use a slotted spoon or fish turner to carefully lift the poached fish up and out of the milk. Serve the poached fish with fresh vegetables, roasted potatoes, rice, or a side of your choice. [4] X Research source You can use the poaching liquid as a base for a creamy sauce. Try thickening the milk with a roux, cheese, or pureed vegetables (like cauliflower)."

Stir the salt into the milk. Set two skinless fillets of fish, each weighing about 1/3 of a pound (150g) into the baking dish so the milk comes about halfway up the sides of the fish. [5] X Research source Ensure that the dish you use is heatproof before you put it in the oven."

      "content": "Bake the fish until they're flaky. Place the dish with the fish in the oven and bake it for 10 to 15 minutes. Lay a piece of wax paper or parchment paper over the fish so the moisture from the milk doesn't escape. Check the fish with a fork to see if it flakes. If the fish doesn't, add a few minutes to the cooking time and check again. [6] X Research source You can bake the fish while they're frozen. Just add about 10 minutes to the cooking time. Avoid flipping or turning the fish over. It should cook evenly in the oven."

      "content": "Broil the fish and serve it. You can serve the poached fish directly from the oven along with sides of your choice. You can also broil it for a few minutes under high heat before serving. This will give the fish a golden brown color. [7] X Research source Simple garnishes for milk poached fish include paprika, parsley, lemon wedges, and butter."

Set two skinless fillets of fish, each weighing about 1/3 of a pound (150g) into the baking dish. The milk should come about halfway up the sides of the fish fillets. [8] X Research source Depending on the size of your fish, you could use an 8x8 dish. Just ensure that it is heat proof and will fit inside of your microwave."

Carefully pull back the plastic wrap so the steam doesn't burn you. Take a fork and rub it over the surface of the fish. If it's finished, it will flake easily. If not, microwave it for another 30 seconds and check again. [10] X Research source You may want to use oven mitts when handling the baking dish. The dish can get very hot, even in the microwave."
