      "content": "Open the compact and place it in a plastic, resealable bag. This will help keep your work area clean. It will also catch any loose bits of powder. If you don't have any plastic, resealable bags, cover the broken powder with a sheet of plastic wrap. Make sure that it is wrapped firmly over the edges, or the powder will escape. This method will use rubbing alcohol. The rubbing alcohol will evaporate, and leave behind the hardened powder. It is considered safe, but if you have very sensitive skin, you might want to consider the method ."

      "content": "Break the compact up into a fine powder, including the not broken parts. Use a spoon, mini spatula, or the base of a makeup brush to do this. Keep smashing the powder until you end up with a fine dust. Make sure that there are no clumps or chunks left, or your compact will be very grainy. This may seem like you are only making things worse, but it will help give you a smoother finish in the end."

    {
      "title": "Add some rubbing alcohol to the powder.",
      "content": "Add some rubbing alcohol to the powder. Depending on how big the compact is, this could be as little as a few drops, to as much as a capful. Use enough rubbing alcohol so that the powder is damp, but not so much that it starts to float. Try to use at least 70% rubbing alcohol. [1] X Research source The higher the percentage, the faster it will evaporate/dry. If you added too much rubbing alcohol, dip the corner of a tissue into it. The tissue will soak up the excess rubbing alcohol."

      "content": "Remove the plastic wrap, and press down on the powder with a tissue. Make sure you use a tissue that will not easily break when wet, otherwise you risk getting tissue particles in your compact. Avoid pressing too hard, or the powder may crack. This will help remove any excess rubbing alcohol. [4] X Research source To get that brand-new, pressed look, use a scrap of cotton fabric instead. It will leave behind that fabric-like texture many brand-new makeup powders have. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Remove the tissue, and clean up the edges with a thin brush, if desired. If you'd like your work to be neater, take an eyeliner brush, and run the point around the edges of your powder. This will help give you those nice, crisp edges. Don't worry about cleaning up the compact case itself just yet."

      "content": "Turn your iron on and set it to the highest temperature. It is possible to set broken powder using just pressure, but it will be very fragile. The heat from the iron will help set the powder further and make it more durable. Because this method contains no rubbing alcohol, it is safe for sensitive skin. [7] X Research source Most compact powders will come in a metal pan set into a plastic tray. Make sure that your compact powder has this metal pan."

You can use anything you'd like however, even a spoon. Make sure that there are no clumps or crumbs however; the powder must be very fine. If you leave any clumps or crumbs, your finished powder will be very grainy."

      "content": "Pull the metal pan out of the compact case. Most powdered makeup will come in a metal pan that is glued into a plastic case. You will need to pull this metal pan out before you move on to the next step. The easiest way to do this is to hook a butter knife under the lip of the pan, and then pry/pop it out. If you don't pull the pan out, you will risk melting the plastic tray."

Start around the edges of the powder, and work your way towards the center. Try not to push any of the powder out of the pan. When you are done, the powder should be packed firmly into the pan. At this point, the powder may look as good as new, but it is very fragile and may shatter again with the smallest bump. You will need to set it further using heat."
