      "content": "Look up the value of your cards online to verify the appraisal. You don’t want to sell your cards based on one collector’s opinion. Once you get your cards appraised, search online for “basketball card pricing guide” or “basketball card values” and compare the listed prices for each of your cards with the prices quoted by the collector. If there are significant differences in the values, you may want to have your cards appraised by a different collector. [1] X Research source Keep in mind that the difference in value could be due to the condition of your cards. The values listed in some online guides may apply to cards when they’re in mint condition. That's why it's a good idea to consult a professional instead of relying only on online pricing guides. Some reputable online pricing guides for basketball cards are the Beckett pricing guide and the Tuff Stuff pricing guide."

      "content": "Learn what makes certain basketball cards more valuable than others. There are 3 main factors that are considered when valuing a basketball card: the condition of the card, the popularity of the player featured on the card, and how rare the card is. Mint condition cards that are rare and feature a popular, well-liked player are the most valuable. Keep this in mind when you’re sorting through your basketball cards. If you’re not sure whether a specific card is rare or not, or whether it features a popular player, look the card up online.
