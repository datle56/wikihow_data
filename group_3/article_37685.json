      "title": "Preheat the oven to 400 °F (204 °C).",
      "content": "Preheat the oven to 400 °F (204 °C). An oven usually takes about 20 to 30 minutes to heat up. Turn it on while you prepare the garlic so it’s at the right temperature when you’re ready to put the garlic in. [1] X Research source To speed up the preheating, you can set the oven to the broil setting first, which uses the top burner inside the oven to create direct, intense heat. Turn the oven to the correct temperature before you cook your garlic."

    {
      "title": "Peel off the papery layer of the garlic, leaving the skin intact.",
      "content": "Peel off the papery layer of the garlic, leaving the skin intact. Garlic cloves have very thin outer layers that are a texture similar to tissue paper. Gently remove these layers with your hands, stopping when you reach the skin of the cloves. [2] X Research source If you also peel off the skin, the head will fall apart. Leave the skin on so the garlic stays intact."
    },
    {
      "title": "Cut about 1⁄4 in (0.64 cm) off the top of the head.",
      "content": "Cut about 1 ⁄ 4 in (0.64 cm) off the top of the head. Use a sharp paring knife to slice cleanly through the garlic on a cutting board. Trim off just enough that the cloves are exposed. [3] X Research source If you don’t see the tops of the cloves, cut off another 1 ⁄ 4 in (0.64 cm). Continue trimming until the cloves are visible."
    },
    {
      "title": "Set the head on a piece of aluminum foil that’s big enough to cover it.",
      "content": "Set the head on a piece of aluminum foil that’s big enough to cover it. Tear off a sheet of foil and smooth it out on a flat surface. Center the head of garlic on top, with the exposed cloves facing up. You can tear pieces from a roll of foil or use precut sheets of aluminum foil, which are found at most kitchen stores or from an online retailer."
    },
    {
      "title": "Drizzle 1 to 2 teaspoons (4.9 to 9.9 ml) of olive oil over the top of the head.",
      "content": "Drizzle 1 to 2 teaspoons (4.9 to 9.9 ml) of olive oil over the top of the head. Be sure to sprinkle oil on each of the exposed cloves, so they can soak up the flavor and moisture. Move your hand back and forth above the head as you drizzle the oil to avoid pouring too much in 1 section. [4] X Research source For more control when applying the olive oil, attach an oil pourer onto the open end of your bottle. You can substitute any type of cooking oil for the olive oil, based on your taste preferences. If you want to season your garlic, sprinkle on sea salt or the spices of your choice after drizzling the oil."
    },
    {
      "title": "Wrap the head in aluminum foil.",
      "content": "Wrap the head in aluminum foil. With the garlic in the middle of the sheet, pull the foil up snugly around the sides of the head. Then crimp the edges of the foil together in the center, checking to make sure there are no gaps where the garlic is exposed. Cover the head completely. [5] X Research source If you accidentally rip or puncture the foil when you’re folding it, start over with a fresh sheet so there are no holes."
    },
    {
      "title": "Place the wrapped head in the oven to roast for 40 minutes.",
      "content": "Place the wrapped head in the oven to roast for 40 minutes. Set the foil directly on the oven rack so that the folded edge at the top of the head is pointing up. The best spot for the garlic is the middle rack, where the hot air can circulate around the entire head, allowing it to cook evenly. [6] X Research source Use a kitchen timer or the clock app on your phone to keep track of the time. You can also place the wrapped garlic on a baking sheet or in the cup of a muffin tin before putting it in the oven. This will prevent any oil from leaking onto the bottom of your oven."

    {
      "title": "Check to see if the garlic is soft by poking it with a knife.",
      "content": "Check to see if the garlic is soft by poking it with a knife. After 40 minutes are up, unwrap the garlic and gently stick the pointed tip of your knife into the head. If it sinks in easily, the garlic is finished roasting. If it’s still slightly hard, rewrap the garlic and let it cook for 10 minutes before checking it again. [7] X Research source Larger heads of garlic will take longer to roast. Continue checking the garlic every 10 minutes after the 40-minute mark."

      "title": "Remove the garlic from the oven and let it cool for 5 minutes.",
      "content": "Remove the garlic from the oven and let it cool for 5 minutes. Set the garlic on a hot pad on the kitchen counter. When you’re ready to eat it, simply peel off a clove or use a knife to cut it away from the head. [8] X Research source To store any leftover garlic, place it in an airtight container and keep it in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks. You can also set the container in the freezer, where the garlic will last up to 3 months."

      "content": "Place 6 tablespoons (89 ml) of olive oil and 25 to 30 garlic cloves in a skillet. Pour the oil into the bottom of a 10 in (25 cm) skillet, then sprinkle in the cloves. Spread them evenly around the pan so they aren’t all clumped together in 1 area. [9] X Research source Don’t overcrowd the pan. The cloves shouldn’t overlap or form more than 1 layer on the bottom of the pan. You can use pre-peeled cloves or buy a head and peel the cloves yourself."

      "title": "Heat the skillet over medium heat until the oil starts to sizzle.",
      "content": "Heat the skillet over medium heat until the oil starts to sizzle. This will take about 2 to 3 minutes. Watch the skillet closely for the first sign of bubbling around the cloves. [11] X Research source If you're using a stove with 9 settings, medium heat will be anywhere from 4 to 6. Don't leave the kitchen. If the cloves sit in the sizzling oil for too long, they'll fry instead of roast."

      "content": "Reduce the heat to low and let the garlic cook for 20 to 30 minutes. As soon as you notice the oil sizzling, turn down the heat on the stove. Leave the cloves to roast and soften in the oil. [12] X Research source To monitor the time, use the clock app on your phone or set a kitchen timer. You can stir the cloves occasionally while they cook to ensure they're coated in oil and cooking evenly."

      "title": "Remove the cloves from the oil and let them cool before eating.",
      "content": "Remove the cloves from the oil and let them cool before eating. Use a slotted spoon to take the cloves out of the skillet. If you're eating the garlic right away, wait 3 to 5 minutes for them to cool off. [13] X Research source If you aren't using the garlic immediately, or if you have leftovers, you can store it in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks. You can also freeze it for up to 3 months."
