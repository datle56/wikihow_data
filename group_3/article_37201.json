      "content": "Requited love is when 2 people have romantic feelings toward each other. It’s often considered the best form of love because both partners are emotionally invested in the relationship. Their attraction and affection towards each other is mutual, setting the foundation for a healthy, lasting bond. Simply put, it’s when you love someone and they love you back.

Even if you experience this type of love, it doesn’t mean you’ve found your partner for life. Just like any other relationship, requited love takes time and energy to maintain, and your feelings (or your partner’s feelings) may change over the course of the relationship."

      "content": "Requited love is reciprocal attachment, while unrequited love is one sided.

      "content": "Signs of unrequited love include feeling unworthy and unappreciated. Since the other person isn’t reciprocating your feelings, you may feel like you’re not good enough for them. You could be putting in a lot of effort to reach out to them and make plans, but they have zero interest in progressing the relationship. In fact, they might even keep their distance as you try to get closer. Other possible signs of unrequited love include: [3] X Research source They maintain firm boundaries with you…and no one else. They’re slow to reply to your texts, calls, or invitations. They don’t make an effort to get to know you better. They send you mixed signals about their emotions. You put them on a pedestal and overlook all their flaws. You have a deep desire for physical touch. You can’t stop thinking about them, even if they ignore you. You deny the signs that they’re not interested in you romantically."

      "title": "Unrequited love can become requited if your crush grows feelings for you.",
      "content": "Unrequited love can become requited if your crush grows feelings for you. It might take time, but it’s definitely possible for the other person to see you in a romantic way. Feelings change quickly, depending on the situation, and your crush might change their opinion about you if they see you enjoying life or being kind to others. Love is unpredictable, which makes it so intense and exciting, so try to embrace the positive and negative aspects of it—even if your love isn’t reciprocated at the end of the day. [4] X Research source Sometimes, unrequited love doesn’t transform into requited love because the other person just isn’t emotionally available or interested in you. Although rejection hurts, remember to focus on your life and stay true to yourself—you never know when you might meet someone special and experience a requited love!"

[6] X Research source Making small changes to improve yourself can boost your attractiveness, both physically and mentally. You might set specific (and realistic) goals for yourself, such as finishing one chapter of a book every day or eliminating candy from your diet. To look your best , choose clothes that suit your body type and show off your best assets. For instance, if you have an hourglass shape, wear form-fitting clothes to highlight your curves."

      "content": "Try pulling away from them. When you take time away from your crush, they might think about you more often and understand how important you are in their life. While you shouldn’t play mind games to intentionally confuse them, try to maintain interests and relationships outside your crush to help you become more attractive and confident. [7] X Research source To play hard to get in a subtle way, you could stop initiating plans with them for a while or leave your phone on silent to stop responding to their texts immediately."
