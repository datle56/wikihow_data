      "content": "Examine the leaves. As a succulent, aloe vera plants store water in their leaves. If the leaves are yellow, brown, or swollen, you’re likely dealing with overwatering . If you notice the leaves are puckering, shriveling, dropping off, or becoming almost transparent, your plant likely needs water. [1] X Research source However, wilting leaves and dark watery leaves can also be a sign of root rot , which we’ll cover in the next section. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Check the soil moisture. You can tell if your aloe vera plant needs to be watered by pressing your index finger a few inches down into the soil. If the soil is dry, your plant likely needs more moisture, so go ahead and water it. If the soil is very moist or water is pooling on the top, you’re likely overwatering your plant. Wait until the soil is thoroughly dried out before watering the plant again, and make sure to do this between each watering session in the future. [3] X Research source Remember, aloe vera plants are succulents and do not need to be watered often. Overwatering can actually kill your plant! [4] X Research source If you keep your plant outside, watering every two weeks should be sufficient. If you keep your plant inside, water it every three to four weeks."

      "title": "Remove the aloe vera plant from its current pot.",
      "content": "Remove the aloe vera plant from its current pot. One of the typical reasons for aloe vera plant death is root rot. If you see mushy brown leaves but don’t suspect overwatering, start by taking the plant out of its pot . [8] X Research source Loosely hold the base of the plant and the bottom of your pot. Tip the pot upside down, and continue holding the plant with your other hand. Hit the bottom of the pot with your hand or knock it against a table ledge (or other hard surface). Depending on the size of your plant, you may need another person to help you. One person should hold the plant base with both hands, while the other person tips the pot upside down and hits the bottom. Jostle the pot back and forth until the plant comes loose. If you still have trouble removing your plant with two sets of hands, run a trowel or knife around the interior of the pot and try releasing it again, or push some of the soil out through the drainage holes in the bottom of the pot. If your plant still does not come out of the pot, you may need to break your pot. While releasing the aloe vera plant from its pot, hold (don’t pull) the plant gently. Hitting the bottom of the pot will keep your roots intact, and gravity will push the plant downward."

      "content": "Remove unhealthy roots with a sharp, sterilized knife or pruners. Examine the roots and determine how many of them are still healthy. Mushy roots are characteristic of root rot, so these will need to be removed. Any roots that aren’t black or mushy are likely still good, so you can leave them on the plant. [9] X Research source If you see a lot of healthy roots and only a section of dead or mushy roots, you can likely save your plant without too much trouble. If you notice that the majority of your plant has damaged roots, it will take a little more effort to save the plant, and it may even be beyond saving. In this case, you can try to save the plant by removing the largest leaves with a knife, cutting away about half of the plant. This method is risky, but with fewer leaves to nourish, the small amount of undamaged roots may be able to better direct nutrients throughout the plant. [10] X Research source"

      "title": "Choose a pot that is one-third larger than the root system.",
      "content": "Choose a pot that is one-third larger than the root system. Any excess soil will hold water and could cause root rot in the future, so a smaller pot is better than a larger one. [11] X Research source The roots of aloe vera plants grow horizontally, rather than vertically. [12] X Research source Aloe vera plants can also become quite heavy, and the weight of the plant can cause a narrow pot to tip over. Thus, it’s better to select a wide pot, rather than a deep or narrow pot. [13] X Research source The pot you choose should also have plenty of drainage holes on the bottom, so that excess water does not sit in the soil. [14] X Research source A plastic pot is best if you live in a dryer climate, while a pot made from terracotta or clay is best for cooler or humid areas. [15] X Research source"

      "content": "Use a potting soil that’s suitable for cactus or succulents. This type of soil has a higher sand content and produces a well-draining environment for your plant. You can easily find suitable soil for aloe vera at your local garden center. [16] X Research source You can also create your own soil mix for your aloe vera plant by mixing equal parts of sand, gravel or perlite, and soil. [17] X Research source If you try this, be sure to use a coarse sand (like builder’s sand), rather than a fine sand. Fine sand can clump and hold water, rather than allowing it to drain down and through the pot. [18] X Research source Although you can use regular potting soil for aloe vera plants, they will thrive better in a mixed soil. Potting soil is more likely to hold moisture and could therefore cause root rot."

Prepare the pot by filling it with the potting soil mixture, and shake your aloe vera plant gently to remove about a third of the soil that has attached itself to the root ball. [19] X Research source Place your plant in the newly prepared pot and cover the top with more of the potting soil mixture. Be sure that the entire root ball is covered with the soil mixture, but don't bury the plant deeper than it was in the first pot. You can also layer small rocks or gravel on the top of the soil, which helps reduce the evaporation of water."

To identify an aloe mite infestation, look for abnormal, disfigured growths on the plant, called “galls.” These galls form when aloe mites inject a chemical into the plant tissues, causing them to grow abnormally. If you see these growths, your aloe plant has been infested by this specific mite, and you’ll likely need to throw it away so the infestation doesn’t spread to other plants you may have."

If you have an outdoor aloe plant and the temperature has been colder than this range, this may be the reason your plant looks like it’s dying. During the colder months of the year, consider moving the aloe plant inside to protect it from the cold temperatures. [28] X Research source"
