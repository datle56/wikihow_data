      "content": "Examine your cards—the rarest card is now the last in the pack. Turn your pack back over so the face side of the top card is toward you. If your booster pack contains an energy card, this will be on top, followed by common and uncommon Pokémon. At the back, you’ll find reverse cards and rare and/or holographic Pokémon cards. It’s not “required” to do the Pokémon card trick to show the rarest card last. It’s just a fun way to build anticipation and make each new booster pack exciting!"

      "content": "Open the package slowly and carefully if you plan on saving the foil as a collectible (and to avoid bending or tearing one of the cards inside): Step 1: Hold the pack by the sides in one hand. Loosen the back flap from top to bottom by sliding your finger up and down underneath it. Step 2: Hold the back flap with your pointer finger and thumb in one hand. With your other thumb, push the top seam of the foil away from the flap (or, pinch the other side of the foil with your other hand and pull the seam open). Step 3: Push or pull until the top seam opens enough to slide one finger inside. Slide a finger inside the seam to fully open the pack from the top. Step 4: Slide the cards out of the top. Make sure the back side of the packaging is facing you to reveal the face of the first card (the front side showing a Pokémon). This way, the color on the back of the code card won’t spoil the rare card for you. [6] X Research source If you don’t plan on saving the foil, feel free to tear into it however you like! Just make sure not to damage the cards inside."
