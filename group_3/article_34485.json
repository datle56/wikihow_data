If you don't have Adobe Acrobat, you can get a 7-day free trial at https://acrobat.adobe.com/us/en/free-trial-download.html . If you choose to encrypt with a password, you can create a password that allows people to open and view your PDF, but not allow them to edit. You can also restrict users who don't have a password from printing or copying the contents of the PDF. Encrypting a PDF with a certificate allows you to specify the recipients of the file and allows you to define their level of access to the file. You can define which users are allowed to edit the PDF, which users are only allowed to view the PDF, and which users are prohibited from copying the file. If you don't have a subscription to Adobe Acrobat, you can use a free program like LibreOffice to protect a PDF with a password."
