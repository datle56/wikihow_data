    {
      "title": "Find your audience.",
      "content": "Find your audience. You'll need someone to perform your magic trick for. Search out a group of people to amaze. Look for people who seem friendly and open to your performance. Avoid people who seem reclusive or groups in the middle of serious conversation."

      "title": "Approach your audience confidently and introduce yourself.",
      "content": "Approach your audience confidently and introduce yourself. Be sure to smile warmly so they feel relaxed in your presence. When addressing a group, position yourself so everyone can see you. Speak loudly enough for them to hear you. Make eye contact as you talk."
    },
    {
      "title": "Pick a volunteer.",
      "content": "Pick a volunteer. Politely tell your audience that you’d like to perform a magic trick for them. Tell them you’ll need a volunteer. Learn the relationship between the people in your crowd. If they're coworkers, you'll likely want to pick the boss. Confident people tend to make better volunteers and will play along to entertain their employees. Find out your volunteer's name and introduce her to the crowd to make her feel like part of the show. Say \"This is Anna (her name), and she'll be helping me perform today.\" Be firm when choosing a volunteer. Point at them and say \"I want you to help me.\" Don't give them a chance to say no or the rest of the audience will think they can say no as well."

    {
      "title": "Fan the cards.",
      "content": "Fan the cards. Say “As you can see, these are in no particular order.” Sneak a peek at the last card in the fan. That’s the card you’ll be forcing on your volunteer. Shuffle the cards a few more times but be sure to keep the force card last in the fan. With your cards fanned out face up, the force card will be at the bottom. Remember your force card, it's the card you'll be making your volunteer choose later on."
    },
    {
      "title": "Reform the deck.",
      "content": "Reform the deck. Flip it over so that the cards are now facing down. The force card is now the top card in the deck. Now that you know the position of your force card, you're ready to perform the force."

      "title": "Have the volunteer pick a number between one and ten.",
      "content": "Have the volunteer pick a number between one and ten. Say, “Do exactly as I do. Count down off the top of this deck like one, two, three, four, five (the number they choose) and deal a card face down for each number that you count.” People will rarely pick one. If they do have them pick again. The idea behind having your volunteer choose a number is making her feel like she is in control of the outcome of the trick. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Pick up the pile of cards you have just dealt.",
      "content": "Pick up the pile of cards you have just dealt. Keep them face down. Put them back on top of the deck. If your volunteer has chosen the number five, your force card will now be the fifth card in the deck. By rearranging the cards, you are creating the illusion that you are further randomizing the order of the cards."

      "title": "Make the volunteer repeat your actions.",
      "content": "Make the volunteer repeat your actions. She will be reversing what you have just done and bringing the force card back to the top of the deck. Have her place her stack back on top of the deck. Talk to your audience during this part of the trick not only to keep them entertained but also to distract them from the fact that your volunteer has just reversed your actions. Jokes can be a great way to distract your audience during this part of the trick, but don’t force it. Showcase your personality. [2] X Research source"

If you've done the trick correctly, she will be holding your force card. Make sure she doesn't let you see the card. You can even hide your eyes. You want it to be clear to the audience that you cannot see the card."

      "content": "Position your hands. Hold the deck face up between your thumb and ring finger with your first two fingers gently grasping the force card. Hold your deck so that there is a one inch slant separating the top card from the bottom card. The top card should be angled towards you and the bottom card should be angled away from you."

      "content": "Pull your force card towards you. With the cards face up, your force card will be the bottom card in the deck. Gently pull it until it is parallel with the top card in the deck. Don't let your audience see you separate the force card from the rest of the deck. Hold your other hand lightly around the cards to help hide your movements. Limit the movement of your fingers. This requires finger dexterity. See the movement from your audience's viewpoint by trying it out in the mirror over and over again until it looks believable."

    {
      "title": "Say, \"tell me when to stop.\"",
      "content": "Say, \"tell me when to stop.\" Riffle through the slanted part of the deck over your forefinger. Go slowly to give your volunteer plenty of time to stop you. Continue to keep your force card hidden as you riffle through the deck. Typically, you want your volunteer to stop you somewhere in the middle of the deck."

      "content": "Place your first two fingers on the bottom of your force card and your thumb on top of the deck. When she says stop, pull the cards in your top hand out of the deck along with your force card. Use your other thumb to hold the rest of the cards in place. Be smooth. Your force card should meet the other cards in midair. This action requires speed in performance, but try it in slow motion several times alone and then increase pace. [3] X Research source"

Take the remaining cards out of the deck and set them aside. The force card should now be on top of the deck.
