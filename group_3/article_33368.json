If there are more than 3 people playing, you’ll need to divide into either 2 or 3 even teams. [1] X Research source If there are 4 people playing, break up into 2 teams of 2. If there are 9 people playing, break up into 3 teams of 3. If there are 12 people playing, you can either break into 2 teams of 6 or 3 teams of 4."

Have each player sit in a seat around a table that’s in between 2 players from the opposing team. This way, each team will have turns in a fair, consistent order throughout the course of the game. [2] X Research source Sit around a kitchen or dining room table in order to have ample space for the board, cards, and chips."

Take out the blue chips and green chips if there are 2 teams, and also the red chips if there are 3 teams. Then, decide which team will get which chip color, and divide the chips equally among the players of the team. [3] X Research source For example, if 1 team of 2 is blue and 1 team of 2 is green, each member of the blue team will be given half of the blue chips and each member of the green team will be given half of the green chips. The red chips will go back into the box. Only use the red chips if you have more than 2 teams; there are less red chips than there are blue and green."

Shuffle both decks separately and arrange them into 2 neat stacks with the cards facing down. Put one of the decks off to the side. Have a player from each team cut the other deck by picking up a part of it. Look at the bottom card of each team’s part. Whoever has the lowest card deals first. [4] X Research source"

Each pile should have an equal number of cards, which depends on how many people are playing: [5] X Research source If there are 2 players, each player gets 7 cards. If there are 3-4 players, each gets 6 cards. If there are 6 players, each gets 5 cards. If there are 8-9 players, each gets 4 cards. If there are 10 players, each gets 3 cards.

Each player will draw from this pile at the end of their turn. Once all of the cards are dealt, the player to the left of the dealer will take their turn to start the game. After their turn is done, have the player to their left go. Continue taking turns in this clockwise fashion throughout the game. [6] X Research source"

As your cards are being dealt to you, become familiar with the board. Try to find the 2 spots that look like smaller versions of each card you have. This way, you can get an idea ahead of time of where you might put your chips."

If you fail to draw a new card before the next player discards theirs, then you no longer have the right to draw a new card for that turn. This is called “Loss of Card.”"

If you’re playing with 2 teams, then 2 completed sequences are needed in order to win. If there are 3 teams, then only 1 sequence is needed to win. [8] X Research source For example, if there is a blue team and a green team and the board has 5 green chips in a row horizontally and 5 green chips in a row vertically and the blue team does not, then the green team wins."

If your team has 3 or 4 chips in a row somewhere on the board, prioritize building onto one of the ends and creating a sequence. If the opposing team has 3 or 4 chips in a row, prioritize blocking them so that they can’t create a sequence. [9] X Research source"

These spaces can be used as bonuses, meaning you only have to have 4 cards to create a sequence if it branches off horizontally, vertically, or diagonally from a corner. Multiple teams can use the same corner space at the same time. For example, if there are 4 blue chips in a row extending horizontally from a bonus corner and 4 green chips extending vertically from that same bonus space, both teams have a completed sequence."

If you have a jack and can see both of its eyes on the card, then you can use it to place a chip wherever you want once it’s your turn. It’s a good idea to hold onto your two-eyed jack until you only need 1 more card to complete a sequence."

This means that you can remove any chip from the board once it’s your turn, as long as it isn’t from a sequence that has already been completed. Take away an opponent’s chip to keep them from completing a sequence."
