      "content": "Choose a fabric that moves easily for a comfortable wrap skirt. You can use any type of fabric that you like for your wrap skirt, but cotton or jersey are great choices. Opt for cotton if you want your skirt to be slightly more structured or go with jersey for a skirt that has some stretch and movement. You can also opt for a sheer fabric, but you’ll need to wear leggings or a slip under it. A fabric that's a little stiff may be easiest to work with. [1] X Expert Source Margo West Professional Tailor Expert Interview. 7 December 2020. However, avoid fabrics that are very stiff, such as leather, vinyl, and denim, as these are harder to sew."

      "content": "Wrap the measuring tape around your waist and multiply the measurement by 1.5. Hold 1 end of the measuring tape and wrap the other end around your waist, about 2 in (5.1 cm) above your belly button.. Pull the measuring tape so that it’s snug around your waist and check the measurement. Then, multiply the measurement by 1.5. [2] X Expert Source Margo West Professional Tailor Expert Interview. 7 December 2020. This is an easy way to determine how wide you’ll need to cut the fabric for your skirt. Another option is to wrap the fabric around your waist 1.5 times and mark where this length ends. [3] X Research source For example, if your waist is 30 in (76 cm), then multiplying that number by 1.5 would give you 45 in (110 cm). It's also a good idea to take a measurement at the largest part of your hip. Write this number down, as well. [4] X Expert Source Margo West Professional Tailor Expert Interview. 7 December 2020."

      "content": "Cut the fabric to the desired dimensions of your skirt plus 2 in (5.1 cm). Measure against your leg to decide how long you want the skirt to be and use this as your other measurement. Then, add 2 in (5.1 cm) to this measurement and to the waist multiplied by 1.5. The 2 in (5.1 cm) will provide extra fabric for the seam allowances. [5] X Research source Use a sharp pair of scissors to cut the fabric to these dimensions. [6] X Research source For example, if the waist times 1.5 is 45 in (110 cm), then adding 2 in (5.1 cm) gives you 47 in (120 cm). If you want the skirt to be 26 in (66 cm) long, then adding 2 in (5.1 cm) gives you 28 in (71 cm). This means that you’d need to cut the fabric to 47 in (120 cm) by 28 in (71 cm)."

[7] X Expert Source Margo West Professional Tailor Expert Interview. 7 December 2020. If you don’t have enough fabric to do this in one long strip, cut 2 strips that are half the total length you need and then sew them together. [8] X Research source For example, if your waist measurement was 38 in (97 cm), then you’ll need a 5 in (13 cm) wide strip that is 114 in (290 cm) long."

Press hard along the fold to create a crease. [9] X Research source Another option is to iron along the fold to crease it. This may be necessary if the fabric doesn’t crease easily.
