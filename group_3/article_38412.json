If you are in one of the following situations, you should read this article to learn more about conducting an online title search. First, you will need to analyze title when you are purchasing property from someone else (for instance buying a home). Second, you will need to analyze title when you are using your own property as collateral (for instance when you are obtaining a mortgage).

      "content": "Understand what types of documents you can find. When you conduct a title search, you will have the ability to look for, and find, a variety of different documents. With that said, a \"title\" will not be one of the documents you find. A property title is a comprehensive term referring to the legal rights an individual has to the property in question. [1] X Research source Having title to a piece of property means you have ownership rights over that property and you can choose to do what you want with it. [2] X Research source Therefore, a title is not a tangible item; it is only a legal term conveying your rights to something. [3] X Research source You are, however, likely to encounter some or all of the following documents when you conduct an online title search: Deeds . A deed is the legal written document that transfers title from one person to another. [4] X Research source Deeds are probably the most common document found in title searches and they are valuable for tracing back ownership of a particular property. Liens . A lien is a property interest document used by creditors to let everyone know you owe them money. [5] X Research source A lien is an important document in a title search because a lien clouds your title. In order to sell or mortgage a piece of property, you must have a clean title, meaning one that is not encumbered by a lien. [6] X Research source Therefore, knowing if you have any liens on a piece of property can be important information to know. Mortgages . A mortgage is a debt instrument used by banks and individuals in order to buy a piece of property without paying for the whole thing up front. [7] X Research source A mortgage is a type of lien, and is therefore an important document to look for during title searches. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Know what kinds of information you are looking for. When you conduct an online title search, you are usually trying to answer two very important questions. First, you usually conduct a title search to understand who holds valid title to a piece of property. This information can be valuable whether you are trying to purchase a home or use a home as collateral on a loan. You should not buy a house until you know the person you are buying it from is legally able to sell it. Also, a bank will not loan you money for a mortgage until they know you are the rightful owner of the home. Second, You want to look at the public land records to see if there are any encumbrances on the land. An encumbrance is a \"right or interest that exists in someone other than the owner of an estate and that restricts or impairs the transfer of the estate or lowers its value. [9] X Research source Examples of encumbrances include liens, easements, covenants, mortgages, or unpaid taxes. [10] X Research source This information is also valuable when you are trying to purchase a home or use a home as collateral on a loan. You should not buy a home until you know that title is free from encumbrances. Also, a bank will be interested in what encumbrances your title has before they offer to loan you money for a mortgage."
