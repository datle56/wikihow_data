As soon as you get up, think about what you need to do and sketch a rough outline of when to do it. Keep work obligations as well as social obligations and errands in mind. [4] X Research source For example, say you work from eight to four and need to call your grandmother for her birthday and pick up your dry cleaning after work. In the morning, figure out what order you should do those activities. If your grandmother is in a later timezone, plan to call her after work so it's not too late where she is.

Alternatively, you can just flag those that will require immediate attention on Monday morning."

      "content": "List your tasks in terms of importance. Before you begin your work load for the day, prioritize. To-do lists are a great tool, but organize them a little rather than just writing down everything that needs to get done. Group tasks in terms of importance. [9] X Expert Source Alyssa Chang Life Coach Expert Interview. 16 October 2019. Before making your list, write down categories in terms of important. For example, tasks labeled \"urgent\" must be done today. Tasks labeled \"important, but not urgent\" are important to do, but can wait. Tasks with labels like \"low-priority\" can be put off if necessary. List tasks under each category. For example, if you need to finish a report for work, that would be an urgent task. If you need to begin another work project, but the deadline is not for another two weeks, that would be an \"important, but not urgent\" task. If you would like to go for a run after work, but it's not vital, that would be a \"low-priority\" task."

If you always have work on you, you can always be making the most of your time. [11] X Research source If you're a student, think about investing in some audiobooks or recording your lectures.

      "content": "Do not multitask. Many people assume multitasking is a great way to get more done each day and manage time wisely. However, focusing on multiple tasks at once actually makes you less productive. Things will take longer to do, as you're not giving anything your full attention. Focus completely on one task at a time instead. You will get your work done quicker this way, allowing you to make the most of your time. [12] X Research source For example, return all your emails. Then, log out of your email account and move on to another task. Do not worry about your email for now.

There are no strict rules about a work environment, so pick what feels right for you. Surround yourself with inspiring decorations that help you feel enthusiastic and passionate. These feelings will help you stay on task and be productive. For example, maybe a particular artist inspires you. Invest in a few prints of their paintings and hang these up on your walls. If you can choose a particular space to work, choose a space free of distractions. Working in front of your television may be a bad idea, but maybe you can push a desk into the corner of your bedroom and work there."

If you find yourself impulsively reaching for the phone to procrastinate, you'll be met with a blank screen instead. [13] X Research source If it's necessary for you to have your phone on for work, place it across the room. If it's not as easy to access your phone, you're less likely to do it.

If you're in the middle of a task and stop to do something else, it can be hard to get back into work mode. When you're working on a task, try to complete it before getting up to do something else. Other things can wait while you strive to complete something. [16] X Trustworthy Source University of Georgia Cooperative Extension Division of the University of Georgia focused on research and community education Go to source For example, if you realize you need to return an e-mail while you're in the middle of something else, do not stop to return the e-mail. Instead, jot down somewhere that you need to send the e-mail and get to it after you finish the task at hand. Keep in mind, sometimes disruptions are inevitable. If you receive an urgent phone call during a task, for example, you should definitely take the call. Do your best to avoid interruptions, but do not beat yourself up over the occasional distraction during your work."
