      "content": "Install an official Xbox 360 hard drive if you don't have one. While most Xbox 360 consoles come with a hard drive installed, the 4 GB S, Arcade, and Core models do not have a hard drive. An official Xbox 360 hard drive is required in order to store the emulation software and saved game data for the Xbox games. Non-Microsoft hard drives will not include the emulation software. If you are buying a hard drive for your Xbox 360, make sure that it is an official hard drive. Use the included transfer cable and CD to transfer your data from your Xbox 360 to your new hard drive before installing it. You can then install the hard drive by removing the Xbox 360's side panel and plugging the hard drive in. See this guide for detailed instructions."
