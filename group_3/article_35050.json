Although the 1880 Shield nickel is slightly rarer, this coin is highly collectible, and a number of high-quality graded examples have been identified.

[3] X Research source However, a higher number of Proof coins were made—coins that are produced specifically for collectors, and which have a higher shine and more definition than regular coins. [4] X Research source Proof coins are not quite as valuable as circulation strikes, or coins that were intended to go into circulation, so collectors should be mindful not to purchase a Proof that’s been mistakenly identified as a circulation strike. Estimated Value: A circulation-strike 1880 Shield nickel graded MS66 sold for nearly $200,000 in 2023."

      "content": "1913 Liberty Head V Nickel In 1913, the Liberty Head nickel was replaced with the Buffalo Head nickel. However, 5 Liberty Head nickels were secretly produced that year, although no one is really sure when or why. These coins were never circulated, and while 2 of the 5 are currently on display in museums, the other 3 are owned by private collectors. [5] X Research source Estimated Value: One of these coins sold for over $3 million at auction! [6] X Research source Because only 5 of these coins are known to exist and their ownership is well-documented, it’s unlikely that anyone will ever find one of these coins in their pocket—but it’s still an amazing piece of history!"

There’s also a version where the bison has 3-1/2 legs—both coins are highly collectible. [7] X Research source Estimated Value: A 3-1/2 leg buffalo nickel graded MS65 sold for over $47,000 at an auction in 2004. But even lower grades can be worth hundreds of dollars.

It can be seen without the help of a magnifying glass—the outline in the Native American’s chin, throat, lips, and headdress features two lines, and the numbers in 1916 are double-stamped, one over the other. [9] X Research source Estimated Value: The value of this coin varies depending on the quality, but a coin graded in “Good” condition could be worth $5,000 or more."

It’s considered the rarest Buffalo nickel. [10] X Research source Genuine versions of this nickel feature a mintmark that’s slightly tilted to the left. Estimated Value: A circulated 1918/7 D Buffalo nickel can be worth $600 or more. In pristine condition, it could be worth up to $400,000. [11] X Research source"

In Gem condition, these nickels have a shiny luster, although in circulated condition they tend to turn greenish as the silver oxidizes. They also feature a notably large mint mark on the back (either P, D, or S). [16] X Research source Estimated Value: Although these coins aren’t particularly rare, they are prized by collectors.

[18] X Research source Estimated Value: In Good (G4, G6) condition, this coin is worth around $25–$30.

They were made of 25% nickel and 75% copper, and nearly 15 million of these coins were made in the first year. They feature a large shield on the obverse of the coin and a 5 surrounded by stars on the reverse.

Certain years of nickels tend to be worth more money than others, largely due to their rarity or historical significance. Here are some of the years of nickels that can be sold for the most amount of money: [26] X Research source 1866–1883: Shield nickels that were minted in Philadelphia. 1913: Liberty Head nickels. 1916: Buffalo nickels minted in Philadelphia with a double die obverse error. 1918: Buffalo nickels minted with an over-date error. 1936: Buffalo nickels minted in Denver. 1937: Buffalo nickels minted in Denver. 1938: Jefferson nickels minted without a completed full strike. 1942: Jefferson nickels minted with 35% silver."

      "title": "Rarity",
      "content": "Rarity Hard-to-find coins are usually highly prized by collectors, so their value may be higher. For instance, because fewer Buffalo nickels were produced in San Francisco than in Philadelphia in 1921, a 1921 Buffalo nickel with an S mint mark (for San Francisco) is worth more than one with a P mint mark (for Philadelphia). [27] X Research source Similarly, Shield nickels without the rays around the 5 are more common, so Shield nickels without the rays are usually more valuable, depending on the condition. Coins with errors are a rarity, so even common coins with planchet, die, or strike errors can be valuable."

      "content": "Condition When collectors examine coins, they check for damage like scratches, dulling, or dings—all of which can damage the value of the coin. On the other hand, an uncirculated coin that’s been preserved in Mint condition can bring in a price much higher than the average for that particular coin. [29] X Research source One thing collectors pay extra attention to is the luster, or how shiny the coin is. Jefferson nickels have an extra designation called “Full Steps.” As the nickels wear, one of the first things to degrade is the appearance of the steps leading up to Monticello. A coin where all of the steps are visible (Full Steps, or FS) will be more valuable than one where the steps blur together."

If the planchet is damaged or it’s too large or too small, it creates an error in the finished coin that can make it more collectible. [31] X Research source Sometimes coins are stamped onto the wrong planchet—if you find a coin that looks like a penny but it’s stamped with a nickel design, that’s a planchet error. If the metals in the planchet aren’t mixed correctly, it can cause the surface of the coin to peel away or look like wood grain."

As you look at the coin, check for tiny parallel scratches called hairlines that can affect the value of the coin. Also, look at how shiny the coin is (called its luster).
