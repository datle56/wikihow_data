      "content": "Position the tip of a spoon against the inner edge of the lid. The lid of the can will have a small, raised lip that has been crimped to seal the can closed. You want to position the spoon in a spot along the inside of this lip. [2] X Research source Hold the spoon so that the inside of its bowl is facing the lid of the can. You need a metal spoon for this method. Any other material won't work."

      "content": "Rub the tip of the spoon back and forth. Work it over the same small area right where the edge of the lid is crimped. The friction from rubbing the spoon back and forth will begin to thin the can lid. Keep going until you have rubbed through the lid. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Pry open the lid. Dig the spoon under the edge of the lid. Pry the lid upward until it pops out of place. Carefully lift it away to reveal the food inside. [6] X Research source If you find it difficult to pry off the lid with the spoon, try using a knife instead. You can use the knife to saw through any small parts of the lid that remain connected to the can. The lid will be sharp, so be careful not to cut your finger on its edge when you pry it off. Use your sleeve or a towel to protect yourself if necessary."

Grip the handle such that your fingers won't be in the way of the blade if it slips. The back of your hand should be facing up. [8] X Research source This method is more effective than attempting to saw the lid off using the blade of your knife . That will ruin your knife and potentially leave metal shavings in your food. Make sure the knife is completely extended and locked into place, so it won't slip. This method can also be done with a chisel, screwdriver, or another sturdy thin object similar to a pocket knife ."

This gentle smacking motion will cause the tip of the knife to puncture the lid of the can. [9] X Research source Do not smack too hard. You don't want to lose control of the knife. Smack with your hand open, and connect with your palm. This will help you maintain control."

Keep going until you see moisture appear on the rock or on the lid of the can. [14] X Research source Turn the can over to check it every so often. You want to stop as soon as you see moisture. This means the lid is thin enough to break through. Don't rub so hard that you rub right through the can lid. Your food will spill all over the rock."

Push up with the knife to gently pry off the lid. Finish pulling off the lid, then discard it. [15] X Research source If you don't have a pocket knife, try using a spoon, a butter knife or another tool. Or find a rock you can use to knock the lid of the can inward. This isn't ideal, since you may contaminate your food with small bits of rock or dirt. When you pull off the lid, cover your hand with your sleeve or a towel so you won't cut yourself."

Your fingers should rest against the side of the handle, safely away from the sharp edge of the blade. [17] X Research source Make sure you have a firm grip . This method can be dangerous if your hand or the knife is slippery. Do not use this method with a knife smaller than a chef's knife. A chef's knife is a large, heavy knife that weighs more than a pruning or steak knife. You need the relatively heavy weight of the blade to effectively puncture the lid of the can."

Place it up against the raised lip at the edge of the can's lid. [18] X Research source The heel should be centered right under the place where your palm is gripping the knife. Make sure it is firmly positioned against the edge of the lid, so it won't slip."

If you have trouble puncturing the can, try standing up and leaning over it. Hold the knife in place with one hand. Place the other hand on top. Apply steady pressure with both hands and push down until the can is punctured. [19] X Research source Do not strike the can to puncture it. The knife may slip and injure you. Instead, apply slow, steady pressure until the knife breaks through the can. Don't be tempted to use the sharp tip of the knife to puncture the can. The heel is more stable and less likely to slip.
