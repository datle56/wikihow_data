Unplug the main unit for about 5 seconds and then plug it back in. Try your garage door opener again. [1] X Research source"

On most openers, you can find the buttons on the back of the unit, on the bottom of the unit facing the floor, or under the light cover. Keep in mind that the opener is the boxed device attached to your garage ceiling, while the remote refers to the smaller, pocket-sized device with 1-3 buttons."
