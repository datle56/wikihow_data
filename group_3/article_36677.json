      "content": "Remove all of the trim from around the fireplace insert. This may include removing some or all of the brick, rockwork, drywall , and even framing from around the fireplace. You may have to use a hammer or mallet to break apart the framing materials, then use a crowbar to pry them away. [2] X Research source The insert may be considerably larger than it appears at first, since it is hidden behind this framing."

      "content": "Remove any nails holding the insert flashing to the wood framing. Sometimes an insert will be surrounded by something called flashing, or flat pieces of metal which overlap the wood framing around the insert. The flashing is often nailed into the framing to hold the insert in place. [3] X Research source Grab the head of each nail with the hooked end of your hammer and pry it free."

      "title": "Disassemble any pipes, vents, or other pieces of the insert.",
      "content": "Disassemble any pipes, vents, or other pieces of the insert. Since fireplace inserts are very heavy, it will help if you can take off as much weight as possible. If you see anything that you can dismantle, take it off before trying to move the insert. Look for screws you can take off with a wrench to help loosen the various pieces. [4] X Research source If you're planning on discarding the insert, you can also remove pieces by breaking them off with your hammer or prying them apart with your crowbar."

      "content": "Pry the insert out of place with a crowbar. A fireplace insert can be 250 lb (110 kg) or more. The insert has probably settled into place, so a crowbar will help you start to loosen it from its surroundings. [5] X Research source Remember to use your legs to bear most of the weight when you're lifting something heavy. Maintain the natural curve of your back and try not to twist your torso to avoid injuring your back. [6] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source You will probably need to have someone help you move the insert if you're not used to lifting heavy objects on your own."

      "title": "Place thick carpet on the floor in front of the hearth.",
      "content": "Place thick carpet on the floor in front of the hearth. Before you remove the insert, lay down a thick rug, a piece of spare carpet, or any other cushion you can find. A thick piece of carpet will help you slide the insert across your floor more easily as you move it, and it will also protect your floor from being damaged. [7] X Research source The carpet should be at least 5 foot (1.5 m) longer and wider than the insert so you can easily grab the edges when you're moving the insert. To ensure it protects the floor, it should be at least 1 inch (2.5 cm) thick. If you don't have an old scrap of carpet handy, try piling up some old pillows or thick blankets on the floor. Keep in mind that whatever you use may get dirty or torn."

      "content": "Wiggle the insert down onto the carpet. If you’re not used to heavy lifting, or if the insert is too heavy for you to move yourself, you might want to ask a friend to help you with this part so you don’t get injured. Using a push-pull technique, slowly work the insert out of its place and let it drop onto the piece of carpet you laid down. [8] X Research source Try to keep the insert upright so it doesn’t spill coal and ash everywhere."

This method is going to work best with a hardwood floor, but you still might need someone to help you move it, especially if you have to lift it over a raised sill to get it out the door.

      "content": "Turn off the gas to the house at the main valve. Before you do anything else near a gas fireplace insert, locate the shutoff valve that controls the gas to your entire home. This is usually a valve located between the main gas pipe and the first appliance, and it’s known as a house-side shutoff valve. It should have a lever that you can close with a quarter of a turn. [11] X Research source There is usually a valve located just before the meter that must be opened and closed with a wrench. This is known as a street-side valve, and should only be operated by someone from the gas company. [12] X Research source Some homes, especially older ones, do not have a house-side valve. In this case, call the gas company and have them turn off your gas for you."

However, if you are going to attempt this yourself, use an adjustable or crescent wrench to unscrew the gas line from the fireplace insert before you move the insert. [14] X Research source Since the gas should already be turned off, there's no need to cap the gas line until after you have removed the insert."

Choose a piece of carpet that's at least 5 foot (1.5 m) longer and wider than the insert. You'll need the overlap so you'll have something to grab onto when you're moving the insert. For the best protection, it should be at least 1 inch (2.5 cm) thick."
